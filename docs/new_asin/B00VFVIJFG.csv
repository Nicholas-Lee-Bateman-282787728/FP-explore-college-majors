7087854,4,B00VFVIJFG,"When it comes to sequels, it's rare enough that one manages to measure up to the first film.  More often than not they end up being disappointing to one degree or another. Particularly when you're talking about animated films (the Shrek and Toy Story films being more the exception than the rule).  But Kung Fu Panda 2 is that rarity among sequels in that, in my opinion, it is actually an improvement on the first film in quite a number of ways, which I'll get to later.

In this film, Po (the kung-fu panda of the title) and the Furious Five (Tigress, Mantis, Monkey, Viper & Crane) are called on to face a new threat:  the return of the exiled Prince Shen (a peacock), who has come back armed with a powerful new weapon and determined to take over the kingdom. Complicating matters though are the fact that Prince Shen apparently had something to do with how Po, a panda, came to be raised by a goose, Mister Ping, his loving if noodle-obsessed father. In order to find the 'inner peace' he needs to defeat Shen, Po must first find the secret of his past, a past that he only sees in flashes of haunting memory that Shen's appearance has awakened in him.

Beyond the plot though, almost everything in Kung Fu Panda 2 is better than the first film, which was already pretty respectable to begin with. One thing is that KFP2 steeps itself even deeper in Chinese culture and it shows in both the sumptuously colored and detailed art of the backgrounds, in the traditions subtly brought out in the story, and even in the musical score wrought by John Powell and Hans Zimmer. And there is more depth, both philosophically and artistically, to the kung-fu; a particular key sequence by Master Shifu early on is a slow and beautiful thing to watch.

The voice actors are all excellent, with all of the original actors reprising their roles:  Po (Jack Black), Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross) and of course Mister Ping (the inimitable veteran James Hong). New additions include a sooth-saying ram (beautifully done by Michelle Yeoh), and kung-fu masters Croc (Jean-Claude Vam Damme) and Ox (Dennis Haysbert). And a notable cameo for film buffs is the voice of the Musician Bunny (director Paul Mazursky).

I have to give particular praise though to how well Prince Shen was done. At first thought, the idea of a villainous peacock sounds, well, ridiculous. But Prince Shen, as conceived and dazzlingly executed by the animators of KFP2, and as masterfully voiced by Gary Oldman, radiates arrogant menace and threat, in attitude and physically, in a fashion that is both artful and deadly. Director Jennifer Yuh said that ""Shen proved to be a great challenge to animate, so much that the complexity of the character was like that of doing six characters all at once."" IMHO, KFP2 is worth seeing just for Shen alone.

And, for what it's worth, this is one of the few 3D movies I've seen that was actually worth seeing in 3D.

My only quibble with the film is that it really didn't develop the Furious Five much as characters, which I would like to have seen. There are hints of things given about Tigress, but they're never really developed, and the rest of the Five are relegated to the same hero-support roles they had in the original.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good story and especially for anyone who liked the first film. This one definitely takes it up a notch.",1308182400,45,3475,4.689655172413793
7087855,4,B00VFVIJFG,"I was a big fan of the first Kung Fu Panda so I was really looking forward to this. However, I did not like it as much as the first one. In Kung Fu Panda 2, we follow Poe as he and the furious five try to stop Lord Shen from taking over China. Not only do they have to stop Shen but they have to destroy a weapon that can destroy them no matter how talented they are with Kung Fu. The story was very predictable and included many cliches. There was not as many jokes and those that were there were not very funny. The Kung Fu and fighting was excellent but that cannot make a movie. I didn't really care about the characters. I only cared for Poe and the Big Rhino Guy with the hammer. I still recommend going to see this movie because you should form your own opinion. I think your younger kids will enjoy this movie but your older ones will not. The animations on this movie are just fantastic. The animations are just so smooth and crisip. It is amazing how far anamation has come. The voice acting is great and this movie has a lot of big name actors doing the voices. I dodn't want to spoil anything so all I will say is that they leave it open for a third installment. The next movie looks very interesting. Overall, I thought it was a decent movie that everyone should see and form their own opinion. I am looking forward to the third movie if they make one and I hope it is better than this one.",1307577600,6,1403,4.086956521739131
7087856,5,B00VFVIJFG,"It's not often that a sequel can outdo its predecessor, but in this case, it has occurred. This movie, however, is even more rare in its superiority over the first (which isn't by much, mind you), because the first was excellent, and it had a huge hurdle to overcome. Terminator was a movie that was exceptional in its own right. Along came Terminator 2, which literally blew the first out of the water. RARE.

Kung Fu Panda 2 didn't blow the first one out of the water, but, in my humble opinion, it was better. Why?

1. The story was more involving, more captivating, more ""root for the good guy"" than the first.
2. The visual imagery was spectacular. Heads and tails better than the first.
3. The ""cute and compassionate"" factor that was prominent in the first was here again, but tenfold.
4. The voice acting in the first seemed a bit forced, like they (all but Jack Black), were trying to overcome some type of ""uncomfortable"" bug. The voice acting in 2 was spot-on. In the first, I found myself consciously listening to the actors doing voice-overs. In the second, I found myself listening to the characters and not paying any attention to the voice acting, as a whole, at all. It was as if everyone came to this movie knowing exactly what they wanted to do and what was expected of them in achieving their goals.

Jack Black proves that he is an extremely talented voice actor. He hit all his marks and then some. Angelina Jolie as Tigress, who was terrible in the first movie, was at the top of her game in 2. Jackie Chan as Monkey was the only one who still seemed to be a bit out of place, but overall, he came out shining, as well.

I'm not one for 3D movies either, but the only one showing at the time I had available was the 3D version, and it was phenomenal, perfectly executed.

Five stars! *****",1307491200,,1812,4.397014925373134
7087857,4,B00VFVIJFG,"I would give this movie 3.5 stars, if that were an option. I didn't think it was as good as the first and it was way too much fighting and kung fu. I think it should've been more of a story and kung fu, which it was but the frist was all story combined with kung fu. It's about how Po, now the dragon warrior, is doing lots of fighting but he wonders where he came from. If you saw the first you might like the second, or like me you might rather just stick with the first.",1307232000,3,473,3.836734693877551
7087858,5,B00VFVIJFG,"This is one of the very few films where I can say I liked the sequel better than the original. All the best aspects of the original are here - the stunning Chinese scenery and settings, Jack Black at his most amusing, odes to classic martial arts movies - but I actually felt the story was a bit stronger. The new 'bad guy' is a Peacock bent on reclaiming the kingdom he was banned for after attacking all the Pandas in the land. The Peacock is beautifully animated, as are all the other characters. Jack Black's Panda must confront his 'inner demons' to move to a new level in his martial arts, and it adds a depth that wasn't there in the first film. Overall, an excellent film for the whole family.",1306886400,,701,4.318181818181818
7087859,5,B00VFVIJFG,"It's been a long time since it was firmly established that Dreamworks and Pixar were the front runners in the animated movie business. Every movie from their boiling pot is a gem, to say the least. In 2008, an unconventional 3D movie burst into theatres with talking animals as per norm, but now we have the Chinese variety. People were skeptical as to how this would turn out, but the makers of the movie, stayed true to the Chinese tradition of movie-making in their depiction of martial arts, and with a cute sprinkling of good old American humor and talented voice acting, this movie was a little more special than the other ones.

As with most of the Dreamworks movies, success demanded a sequel and the producers and writers rose to the occasion and boy, did they deliver. Right off the bat, I would say one thing, `Kung Fu Panda 2' is a better movie than the original in every way. It is in no way a watered down sequel with many missing links and vain attempts at establishing a franchise. This, viewers, is what a sequel should be. This movie is bigger, funnier and more likely to tug at your heartstrings than the previous one.

Ever since the Shrek sequels, Dreamworks has been accused of dumbing down the quality of the sequels with lots of pop culture references and mindless jokes that are only likely to earn a few chuckles. But no one can make that claim anymore. This movie finds its strengths and all its factors : animation, story and action sequences are the best out of Dreamworks' production house.

All of the main cast including the titular Po (Jack Black), the Furious Five and Master Shen are back in this one. Jack Black has really found his footing and a most fitting role for him in the panda. It suits his voice perfectly and fans of the actor may even find both indistinguishable. The Furious Five, this time are a lot warmer to Po, now that he is the Dragon Warrior. Shifu, too, accepts Po to the fullest and tries to teach him how to achieve inner peace.

This sequel follows the time-tested norm of sequels to delve into the main character's past or open up new wounds. The goose as it turns out, is not the biological father of the panda (Oh My God!). Pandas had been prophesized as the ones to defeat the peacock Shen, and so Shen went on a killing spree, harnessing his invention of gumpower to destroy all giant Pandas. Po is a survivor. Faced with this dilemma, Po chooses to stop Shen from destroying Kung Fu with his technology, and must make peace with his past. This stroy resonates the traditional Wuxia genre of China, which you might be familiar with from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

The action sequences are masterfully directed in true Hong Kong cinema style. The dialogues are hilarious and consistently uplifting and funny. That does not mean this movie shies away from other emotions. One scene in particular is a tear-jerking one. And when you find such a scene in an Animated ""Meant for kids"" movie, you know this movie is special. I hate to take the name here, but, Kung Fu Panda just might be Dreamworks' Toy Story. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie snagged the best animated movie award away from Disney/Pixar.

This movie is a must for all ages. If you have a soul, you will not miss this one. Also, watch in 3D. The technology has been used to great effect in this one, so far as to making me say this might be the best 3D movie of the summer.

7087860,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Kung Fu Panda 2 is the much anticipated sequel to the 2008 hit movie. This movie has two plots. The first plot involves an evil peacock named Shen. He threatens to destroy kung fu with a cannon. It is up to Po and Furious Five to save kung fu and stop Shen's evil ways. it is established in the first movie that Po's father is a goose named Ping. A goose can't be the father of a panda. This movie explores Po's roots further and answers the question of what really happened to Po's parents. Po is the dragon master, but he is advised by Master Shi fu to find inner peace. This quest for inner peace gives this film a spiritual quality the first film did not have. Po learns that it does not matter how a panda starts out in life. The important thing to remember how a panda chooses to be and live his life in the present. This lesson can also be applied to people as well.

Gary Oldman provides the voice of Shen. His movements are quick and graceful. I love watching Shen move especially in the fight sequences. Oldman's voice work is very good here. Jack Black is equally excellent providing the voice of Po. He is so funny in one scene trying to eat as many dumplings as he can. He is fun to watch fighting wolves or dodging blasts from Shen's cannon. Dustin Hoffman provides the voice of Master Shih Fu. The fun is figuring out who provides the voices of the minor characters like the crocodile and hippo. Every scene of this movie is bright and colorful too. Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very entertaining movie.",1306540800,2,1510,4.27972027972028
7087861,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Movie studios nowadays seem to cash in on movie sequels; if the first one is a success, than there is a sequel in the works. Dreamworks COULD of made a poor sequel, and people would of seen it. Fortunately, Kung Fu Panda 2 is one of those RARE sequels that actually is BETTER than the original.

The second film starts out with Po (Jack Black), he is now the Dragon Warrior, along with the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) are reprising their voices to these characters. Now, they have to go against a new villain named Lorn Shen (Gary Oldman) who is going into the villages and taking anything metal with him and his goons.

Yet, there is something interesting about Lord Shen that Po see's; it's a symbol that Po has seen before, but he is not quite sure of what it means, but Po thinks it has something to do with his parents. After some asking from his dad Mr. Ping (James Hong), he tells Po what happened.

As the story progresses, it turns out that Lorn Shen has a weapon, and has evil plans for this weapon, so now it's Po and the Furious Five's job to stop Lorn Shen.

This film is aimed at kids, but adults can enjoy it too; I went to go see this with my fiance opening night, and not only did she love it, but I loved it too. The writing is excellent, the animation is a mix of 3D and hand-drawn animation (a couple of scenes here and there are hand-drawn, and even they look excellent), it's funny when it needs to be funny, it's touching when it needs to be touching, and overall, this is a good film. Dreamworks put a lot of time into the animation and writing, and definitely a lot of time in character development, they definitely have a winner with this one. If you have kids, or an adult that LOVES animation films, go see this.",1306540800,,1868,4.359195402298851
7087862,5,B00VFVIJFG,"My husband, child, and I are fans of the original Kung Fu Panda, but I was rather wary about this sequel since most sequels are never nearly as good as their predecessors. Well, I am glad to be proven wrong by Kung Fu Panda 2! All three of us thought this was not only a worthy successor to the original but actually much better. The key elements that make an animated movie a winner are all here - a stellar cast, impressive animation, well-written script, and a story that appeals to both children and adults.

The original cast returns in this sequel with Jack Black providing the voice of Po the adorable Dragon Warrior Panda; Angelina Jolie as Tigress; Jackie Chan as Monkey; Seth Rogen as Mantis; Lucy Liu as Viper; David Cross as Crane; Dustin Hoffman as Shifu the Kung Fu Master; and James Hong as Mr. Ping, Po's dad. In this sequel, viewers are introduced to a new nemesis, Shen, a magnificent peacock skilled in Kung Fu, yet possessed of the blackest of hearts. Shen is ably voiced by Gary Oldman, and every nuance and turn of phrase conveys the evil residing within this creature. One of my favorite Asian actresses, Michelle Yeoh provides the voice of the Soothsayer Ram, an important character in this movie.

The story this time centers around Po trying to find his inner peace as instructed by Shifu. Trouble is, Po is haunted by questions about his past, triggered by an encounter with a bandit wolf. Meanwhile, as Po goes through this inner conflict (something which he chooses not to share with his friends), there is serious trouble brewing over in the capital city. Shen, who was once the heir to the Peacock Throne has amassed an army of ferocious wolves, and most importantly, invented a weapon that makes Kung-Fu seem almost obsolete. Shen is enraged when the Soothsayer Ram refuses to back down from her prediction made many years ago - that Shen's fate is intertwined with that of something which is black and white. So the stage is set for a showdown between Po and Shen.

The story flows seamlessly, and the animation is of stellar quality. We watched it in 3-D, and I enjoyed the effects, especially the battle scenes (and there are tons of those in this movie). The talented cast makes this a pleasure to watch as each actor brings a unique interpretation to his/her character, and it wasn't about Jack Black voicing a panda, but Po as a real character that comes into his own in this sequel. As in the original, positive messages abound here and these are woven seamlessly into the fabric of the story without seeming to come across as overly didactic. Themes such as the notion of what constitutes a family; loyalty; friendship; ambition/greed/evil; and self-identity are all portrayed in a convincing manner, and best of all, there's lots of humor in here, even when the subject matter is serious. This perfect balance of light and dark, the comical and serious, goes perfectly with the Eastern philosophy of Yin and Yang, and Po is the embodiment of these contrary forces.

Kung Fu Panda 2 is rated PG, with a running time of 90 minutes. It is a movie that will appeal to both children and adults, and is entertaining, fun, and poignant. Highly recommended!",1306454400,51,3190,4.680926916221034

It does have some powerful scenes in it which he struggled to understand.  There is a scene were the main bad character is killing every panda to prevent his own future death and then his parents reject him because he has committed this horrible crime.  He did struggle with this and asked many times for me to explain to him what was happening and to explain to him why the peacock's parents didn't love him anymore because, he killed the pandas.  It made me feel that actually this movie was not appropriate for him at this age.  It is rated as a PG movie and I probably should have given that rating more serious attention and looked into the reason why it was given this rating before allowing him to view it.

7087926,3,B00VFVIJFG,"Same voice cast, though they sounded different-- at least Dustin Hoffman did. There were scenes which looked unfinished in CGI, so quality varies. Not really a good film, though Angelina Jolie has more lines as Tigress than in the first film. This film has a rather thin story, with many pointless action shots, though Po catching cannonballs was impressive. Back stories shown in crude hand-drawn animation was distracting. Since I never liked Po all that much I watched what Tigress was doing. A peacock named Shen (Gary Oldman) tries to take over China by using cannons, which apparently nobody else has every seen before. Po naturally dominates the action. Lucy Liu as Viper hardly says a word. The extra features consist of 3 22-minute shorts in crude animation, one of which The Secrets of the Furious Five, had been available in the first movie DVD. There were pointless clips episodes, and one too short documentary on the voice cast. Also, no icons Oring was included in the package sent",1493337600,,996,4.899408284023669

7087934,4,B00VFVIJFG,I'm not a big jack black fan but he has a great voice for animated comedy. His supporting cast of the Kung fu masters especially the tigress playing off the panda made the movie pace work. It was nice to see the panda grow in confidence by being lacking confidence.

We watch them on TV, our Kindles, and phones and even after the hundreds of times we have watched them, I still find them entertaining and funny.

I love being able to access the Amazon videos from all our devices and it really helps us get through car rides and although he is 2, he can turn it on himself.

Come to find out, you can only redeem this into Google Play, Flixster, and some other format that probably 4 people have ever used.
Maybe I'm an idiot and not able to figure this out. Every other movie I've eve purchased with a Digital copy has had an option available to redeem it into Itunes including Kung Fu Panda 3! If anybody knows of a way to fix this please let me know.",1468713600,,604,4.170940170940171

7088088,4,B00VFVIJFG,"4 Stars. The original writers, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, are back with co-creator and now director, Jennifer Yuh, with a sequel that surpasses the original and won the Academy Award for Best Animation. Working with the established characters, Po (Jack Black), Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), and the Furious Five [Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Monkey (Jackie Chan)] are back to face a new challenge. Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) is obsessed with power and wiping out the kung fu masters like Master Ox (Dennis Haysbert), Master Croc (Jean-Claude Van Damme), and Master Rhino (Victor Garber). With the use of canons and a wolf army lead by Wolf Boss (Danny McBride), his evil scheme is brought to the attention of Po and Furious Five, as they raid a local city for metal to build more canons. Lord Shen was warned by a fortune teller, Soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh), that he will be defeated by a panda and previously tried to kill all the pandas. Po becomes haunted by flashbacks of his past that hinders his fighting ability. He soon becomes obsessed with learning about his past and seeks Shen our against the advice of his friends. Once the past comes to light, he finds the inner peace that he needs to defeat Shen. Once again the movie brings in a stellar cast and a great storyline that expands on the original. With Po being the only Panda with a mysterious past, they were able to bring in more heart, especially with Mr. Ping who adopted him as a boy. It also has a darker tone, which may have been helped along by executive producer Guillermo del Toro. The ending sets us up the the third one in the series Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016), where we know that Pos parents are still alive. Its a must see for kids and fans of the kung fu drama, as it stands up to some of the greats.",1468454400,4,1839,4.5589123867069485

It is a great family movie, there is no cursing, lots of teamwork and strong morals. The movie plot involves a panda that was adopted and it gives a positive influence to being adopted.  I especially liked this as so many kids today don't understand the concept of adoption.  This movie reinforced that when you are adopted, you are chosen and are loved very deeply.  The Panda's quest to his roots has an interesting plot which involves great balance between good and evil as he takes a step into a world previously unknown to him.  Once again, it's a great movie and my family truly enjoyed it.",1461196800,,736,4.545454545454546

7088277,4,B00VFVIJFG,"Warning, this review may contain some spoilers.
This film is much better than the first Kung Fu Panda movie. I adore how Jack Black brings so much life to the character, Po the Dragon Warrior. This movie is indeed an animated classic that the whole family can enjoy. The action scenes shows off Kung Fu with a great dash of humor. The story line is fairly predictable, but considering its made for kids, I still found the film extremely well executed. Also, the jokes in the film made all my friends and relatives laugh. The animation in this film is pretty stunning and well detailed. Some of my favorite scenes are the fight sequences between the Panda and the villainous Peacock. Also, I can't get over the scenes of Baby Po with the radishes. The baby panda is probably the most cutest thing that animators ever created. I mean....ten times cuter than minions.",1457740800,3,864,4.65359477124183

This story ties directly into the third installment of this franchise, which is why we saw this before going to the theater to see the third one.  This installment explains a lot of the missing pieces from Po's family story.  But the villain in this story doesn't seem to have the ""fear factor"" that the first one has.  Also, there is just no place for the bull or croc that appear in this movie.  I don't understand their behavior at all.  It added nothing to the story.",1455753600,3,611,4.353982300884955

7088409,4,B00VFVIJFG,"Thoughts I had about Kung Fu Panda 2 as I watched it for the first time:

Hey, this sequel is as good as the original.
Sequelsespecially animated action moviesoften suffer from brain drain. Once the origin story has been told, whats left for the characters to do? More action? Usually, and often at the expense of character development. But that doesnt happen to Po (Jack Black), who became the Dragon Warrior in the first installment.

Huh, its actually a second origin story.
If the first film had me seeing elements of Star Wars, this second one had a Superman vibe. Like young Clark Kent, Po is found as an infant and raised by someone else, and of course like Clark Kent little Po grows up to be a superhero who is tasked with responding to all threats against their community. Despite their different species, it never occurs to Ponow so famous that children play with his action figure as well as the Furious Fivethat he might be adopted, which he discovers in Kung Fu Panda 2. Mr. Ping the noodlemaker (James Hong) is worried that his son might abandon him, as he sets off to learn the truth about his origin and also stop Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), an albino peacock, from taking over all of China. As a result, theres as much action and as much room for Po to grow as there was in the original Kung Fu Panda.

The animation actually kicks it up a notch.
The peacock fight scenes are especially mesmerizing because of their combination of grace and implied power. Long shots and action scenes are this films strengthsno doubt one reason why it received a Best Animated Feature Film Oscar nomination. That Rango won instead probably is a reflection of one thing:

The plot of Kung Fu Panda 2 is essentially the same as Kung Fu Panda.
Po tries to find himself in the first filmthe son of a noodlemaker who seems destined to follow in his fathers footsteps, though he dreams of being a kung fu warriorand he does in this one too. Action will help him arrive at a point of recognition, but instead of a former pupil of Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) who escapes from prison and threatens to take over China, its the son of a Peacock Dynasty that invented fireworks who turns his parents good invention into something bad by creating gunpowder, cannons, and cannonballs that Poe and the others must fight. Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen) and Crane (David Cross) return to fight like animal Avengers, along with two new characters, Master Ox (Dennis Haysbert) and Master Croc (Jean-Claude Van Damme). Still, despite the warmed-over plot, the action is different enough and the writing and the animation are strong enough to make you overlook any similarities.

Looks like the filmmakers had a trilogy in mind from the very beginning.
We don't realize until Kung Fu Panda 2, which picks up shortly after the action of the first film had ended, that theres a three-movie narrative arc. Pos revelation that hes adopted and the films ending make that perfectly clear.

Beware of several Bambis mother moments.
There are a few more sad scenes in the sequel than there were in the first movie, because you're dealing with death and feelings of abandonment and/or rejection, and because the comic relationship between Po and his adoptive father turns more serious at several junctures. Small children might need a little coaching along the way. Or else, heck, you could just let them find their own way, as filmgoing children have been doing for generations now.

And what sense does it make to include identical bonus discs on both rereleases?
In addition to an audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a short voice talents feature, for whatever reason DreamWorks/Fox decided to include the same bonus disc of content on this rerelease as on the Kung Fu Panda rerelease. So if you buy both films on DVD youll find yourselves with an extra disc.

Language: n/a
Sex: n/a
Violence: More intense action than the first, especially since Po absorbs more punishment

I could see how the animators must have used a real person as the model for Po because his facial features moved quite realistically.

7088434,3,B00VFVIJFG,"Jackie Chan and Jean-Claude Van Damme together in a film at last, even if it is just as voices (hopefully they'll do an 'EXPENDABLES' film together next)! The rest of the all-star voice cast, from the original, returns with Chan as well including Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, James Hong and Jack Black as Po (the 'Kung Fu Panda'). New voices (besides Van Damme) include Michelle Yeoh, Gary Oldman, Danny McBride and Dennis Haysbert. This time the film is directed by Jennifer Yuh, an Art and Animation Department vet but first time film director. It was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (who also co-wrote the first film). The movie is not quite as much fun as the original (which wasn't a great film to begin with) but it does deliver the laughs and action fans expect.

The first film dealt with Po living out his dream by joining his kung fu heroes, 'The Furious Five', and becoming the chosen 'Dragon Warrior'. In this chapter he struggles with coming to terms with who he really is and where he came from (now knowing that he's adopted). While battling his inner demons he also must lead 'The Furious Five' to face a new enemy with a weapon that destroys kung fu. Of course he won't be able to conquer this new found enemy and deliver peace to his people until he finds peace within himself. To do this he must discover the secrets of his past.

The movie is just about what you'd expect from a sequel. If you're a fan of the original you'll probably enjoy this chapter as well, just not quite as much. Black and the rest of the cast are funny, a lot of the jokes are of course silly and geared at kids but the film has a decent amount of laughs to deliver a slightly older crowd as well (like the first).

The action scenes are entertaining although I heard from my two young nephews (who I saw the film with) that the movie is too scary at times and much more frightening than the original (I personally didn't notice). Guillermo del Toro was an executive producer and creative consultant on the film this time around and some say he added a darker tone to it. As I said I didn't really notice much of a difference in that way from the original but I'm sure that could be a slight possibility. The movie is fun regardless and should please most fans of the original.",1454371200,,2321,4.443661971830986

7088521,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Out of all the DreamWorks Animation Movies I've seen (and I've seen all of them), this one is definitely my favorite. In fact, excluding all the PIXAR films, this is probably one of my two favorite animated movies of all time. While DreamWorks may be a studio that has plenty of ups and downs, sometimes sacrificing the story for humor, this one is the perfect mix of both, while there is plenty of humor, there is also a decent level of drama, that causes an attachment with the characters. Another great part of the movie is the level of action this one provides, while the first film (understandably) had to concentrate on how the character first becomes the Dragon Warrior, and his training to defeat Tai Lung, this one can enter right into the action without seeming overly forced. Like I said earlier, there is a good level of humor in this two, that works with the story, rather than takes away from it, and had me enjoying some of the weirdness of it. On the downside, there is a little bit of cheesiness, but it really doesn't do enough to take away from my five star rating.
 I hope to see Kung Fu Panda 3 in the theaters next year. (Later this month if I had written this review tomorrow).",1451520000,,1200,4.429864253393665

7088605,4,B00VFVIJFG,"A fun, well-animated action-fest romp. The effects are good and the animation is humorous. The story is enough to keep a casual viewer engaged, operating under a few cliches of the kung-fu genre. Lord Shen makes for an amusing villain as well as his wolf minions. Gary Oldman's performance is marvelous. The only complaints I have are that the character development is extremely slight in this film; Po, the protagonist, does not really develop at all in this movie, except that he learns a new technique. The other characters make merely a token appearance, other than Tigress, who almost becomes more developed but falls just shy. There isn't really a lesson in this movie for children except that I guess you should be tranquil in the midst of turmoil, which is fitted in fairly thinly. This is a film for entertainment purposes, and if you're looking for a movie that teaches children a good lesson, I'd pass this one up. But if you're looking for funny, competently made, action packed adventure, then this is your jam.",1432944000,2,1024,4.823863636363637
7088606,5,B00VFVIJFG,Just a great family film with some lessons for all.,1432944000,,51,4.2
7088607,4,B00VFVIJFG,"I'll admit I had to get talked into going to see the original Kung Fu Panda, but I quickly got caught up in the story.  So when they started advertising Kung Fu Panda 2, I knew I would have to see it.  While not as funny as the original, it is still quite entertaining.

The story picks up at some point after the first movie ends.  Now officially accepted as the Dragon Warrior, Po (voiced by Jack Black) is known as a national hero.  He regularly joins the Furious Five as they use Kung Fu to defend China from enemies.

Unfortunately, a new enemy is about to return.  Shen (Gary Oldman) was banished because of his desire to use fireworks for evil.  But there is a prophecy that Shen will be defeated by a black and white warrior.

Meanwhile, Po is beginning to think that he might not be related to his father the goose.  He is seeing flashbacks of his old life and begins to think that Shen might hold the answers.  Will Po learn the truth?  And if so, will Po find the inner peace to defeat Shen?

In my opinion, there are two kinds of sequels - those that basically rehash the plot and those that try to continue the story.  This is definitely a sequel in the later category.  Yes, Po still has much training to learn.  No, he's not a perfect fighter.  But he can hold his own, and the Furious Five have accepted him as an equal.  In fact, it is clear early on that he is a much loved member of the group.

Having said that, the Furious Five are hardly better developed than they were before.  Angelina Jolie's Tigress and Seth Rogan's Mantis get the best development, but it's honestly hard to remember who is who from the rest of the five.  Really, Po and Shen are the only characters who get a decent amount of development this time around.

I mentioned that this movie wasn't quite as funny as the original, and that's true.  There are still plenty of laughs.  There are great one liners, sometimes in a least expected places.  And the action scenes are often funny as well while still taking the Kung Fu seriously.  In fact, I'd argue that the action scenes hold up better here than some of them do in live action movies.

The computer animation is good, but that's hardly surprising.  While there are no breathtaking shots, everything looks fine and there is nothing to push you out of the story.

And the voice cast is wonderful.  The fact that almost everyone in the cast is a well known actor doesn't get in the way at all.  I hardly recognized their voices, instead getting caught up in the story unfolding on the screen in front of me.

So Kung Fu Panda 2 is a worthy follow up to the original.  No, it's not quite as good, but it still entertains.",1432252800,,2666,4.321212121212121

The audio menu has a selection for Dolby True HD 7.1 but when selected the sound track only plays in Dolby Digital ( an old DVD format). Tried the non-3D blu ray in the 3 disk combo pack and it played perfectly in Dolby True HD. It appears in this case you have an option of either 3D with sub par audio or non 3D with incredible 7.1 audio. Most people only have a home theater in a box and won't notice this, but if you are an audiophile home theater enthusiast, it will greatly disappoint you in the audio using the 3D blu ray.

It was great. Really funny! Really Fun. Can't want for the next in the series.

Here are some talking points:

China is apparently filled with talking animals, which is weird, because Chinese immigrants tend to be human. As least, the ones I see.

Kung fu is pretty easy to learn, once you conquer the emotional sticking points that are keeping you from exploring your potential.

Praying mantises are not as religious as their name suggests.

Cranes are horrible people, which I'm sure many of you already knew.",1417651200,,599,4.6571428571428575

7088703,4,B00VFVIJFG,"Kung Fu Panda 2
 Kung Fu Panda 2 continues not just the Panda franchise but also continues a string of very good childrens films in 2011.  The film re-unites the audience with the bold and cuddly martial arts master, a big soft and very skilled young Panda.  He and his band of Kung Fu animals must travel to a distant city to defeat the evil peacock emperor before the emperor uses the newly discovered gunpowder cannon to enslave all of China.  The violence is typically animated PG rating style.  No one seems to ever be killed or badly injured, no blood spilled.  This is a movie for the youngest among us.
 A sub-plot about the Pandas true family might be-he suddenly realizes that he is a big furry Panda and his dad is a goose.  This might cause a tad of discomfort to some children with familial issues.
 This one hour and 38 minutes long kid flick is just about right in length, it allows the kiddies to enjoy an outing but not so long as to tax their sometimes limited abilities to sit still.  The producers spent an amazing $150 on making the film.  With a world-wide gross already of $111 their investment seems secure.
 The two best things from my point of view are the lavish and intricate settings and the amazing cast of famous stars.  When compared to other very fine animated films, Aladdin comes to mind, the depth and complexity of the scenes really adds to the enjoyment of the film.
 And what a cast we have.  Angelia Jolie provides the voice of a tigress.  How apt.  Jack Black, who is kind of soft and cuddly in real life, is the soft and cuddly Panda.  Dustin Hoffman plays a Yoda like mentor and kung-fu master.  Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Michelle Yeoh all supply voices to various animated animals.  Seth Rogen and even tough guy actor Jean-Claude Van Damme also have a place.  The best casting decision of all is Gary Oldman.  He plays the vile and villainous peacock emperor with exactly the right inflections to make us truly hate the bad guy.
 Kung Fu Panda 2 is worthy of four saw blades, which surprised me too.  It even seems to have a good message for the kids and all of us.  Even if your dad is a goose, he loves you very very much.",1411603200,,2166,4.381909547738694

Look I'm not going to waste much of your time here, because lets face it, movie preferences vary SO much from person to person, I could tell you that most people I know Liked or Loved this movie. My Kid loves it, her friends Love it, and its for the most part MADE FOR KIDS. But you may not care for it or even hate it, you know why? Personal preference, I would assume if you liked the first one, you will like this one as well - Possibly as much if not more so, but I make no Guarantees here people, rent it and find out yourself, stop trusting other peoples reviews, they aren't the same as you, I'm no different.
With that said, I suppose you probably won't read the rest of my review. =P

Jack Black Bring Kung FU Panda Back!
Okay so that rhymed unintentionally, moving right along then!
So I was pretty skeptical when the Original showed up, Jack black has a -- Interesting track record, its a Love it or Hate it feel. I think he can be pretty funny, but sometimes overexerts himself a bit, my opinion, I'm entitled to it, deal with it. With that said, he brings life to this character and to the TV show, I feel like he has proven himself to be a good voice actor through this. ... to be honest he even LOOKS like the character, its almost funny in itself.

Furious Five! ;D
Look, the cast of voice actors for this movie outside of Jack Black is pretty top notch. Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, David Cross, and Lucy Liu. I mean, wow names on top of the charts here, and for the most part they don't disappoint. The characters most of the time feel well portrayed.

The Villain >=D
Gary Oldman, fantastic job, I personally enjoyed his character, his portrayal of it, and I think it was a cool villain. What more is there?

The Story ~~
Look your not gonna win any awards he-- Oh it did win some awards? And was nominated for others also? ... Well then... No really honestly the awards mean almost nothing these days, they hand them out like M&M's fall out of an open candy bag that just hit the floor - its kinda lame. Might wanna clean that up too before someone trips over it.
No but seriously, I think this movie has a fantastic story, as good if not better than the first, I look forward to additions to the series in the future. There was good character development, and it tied in well to the previous movie. It provided a new feel, while still being true to its original concepts.

The Summary:
I believe you will enjoy it, the writing was good, acting was good, the music was great(awards), and the animation is on the top tier. It IS a kids movie first, meant to entertain adults SECOND. If you keep that in mind, you're good.
Personally Im kinda a kid at heart, I love most of the newer animated films, and if you do as well, I think you'll like this one too.

THOSE ARE THE FACTS--
...as pertaining to my opinion... which matters not to you... which means YOU need to watch it yourself.

7088798,5,B00VFVIJFG,"When I saw the first ""Kung Fu Panda"" movie I thought that they couldn't possibly make a sequel that could be better than this.  And boy was I wrong!  This movie was indeed better than the first!  It upgraded everything!  And I mean everything!

This movie really does take the heights to whole new levels.  There is even a very important, and very effective, lesson in this movie (one that I won't spoil) that really relates to our present-day problems.  And the lesson is taught very well throughout the movie.  We even see it change Po, which is something we don't see to our main characters  very often in cartoon movies.

This movie ups the action, a lot of it.  We even get a whole lot more funny comedy than the first.  The villain is really well-done and completely beats the one from the first movie.  The music is just beautifully done.  And there is also great character development as well.

""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is the real definition of ""don't judge a book by its cover"".  This is something that all kids will enjoy, including parents.",1387238400,5,1045,4.508021390374331

7088828,4,B00VFVIJFG,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked this movie.  In spite of one particular voice/actor who I normally can't abide under any circumstance, namely Jack Black.  But here, disguised as a panda named Po, he is acceptable (but he wouldn't have been my first choice).

The story begins with a flashback, a prophecy of a peacock named Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman), who seeks to rule China but who, according to a soothsayer, is also doomed to be thwarted by a black and white warrior.  Here things go all Biblical; Lord Shen tries to exterminate the entire panda population (zebras were ignored).  Naturally, Po was overlooked.  Flash-forward, a new adventure.  Of course, Po's as incompetent as ever, a boob of great girth with good intentions.  Along come some metal thieves and the frantic five, plus Po, spring into action.  It is the year of the peacock; all is not well.  What follows is a lot of running around, scrambling; fighting/losing, with little progress made in defeating their newest enemy, a bird.  ""I might also convert the basement into a dungeon.""

It's more than a little annoying the way most action films are constructed, evil triumphs until the very last minute.  Sadly, it's a well-worn formula that most filmmakers stick with.  It does little, however to provide any real suspense (other than frustration).

The score was fantastic, the artwork dazzling, I just hope part three, due out late in 2015, improves the story a lot.",1380585600,,1462,4.862348178137652

7088838,5,B00VFVIJFG,"How do you qualify the success of a sequel? Is it whether the film matches or outperforms the original at the box office? Is it an improvement of artistic merit? Or is it taking the sequel in a slightly new direction and succeeding? Kung Fu Panda 2 may be the first animated sequel to answer each of those questions in the minds of each viewer.

Not long after Po (voiced by Jack Black) became the Dragon Warrior and, with the assistance of the Furious Five, saved the kingdom from the escaped snow leopard Tai Lung, the portly panda wears his fame on his sleeve. Never letting those around him forget who is the most powerful kung fu warrior alive. His father has even begun using his son's fame as a selling tool for his own noodle shop. Yet, when a new force threatens the Valley of Peace, Po joins forces with Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) to wrest control from the mad, white peacock Shen (Gary Oldman). Also back to serve up advice and set Po on his journey is Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a diminutive Grand Master struggling to find in himself inner peace.

Simple as the plot may sound, a challenging execution lays before Jennifer Yuh, a first-time big screen director who has worked in storyboarding and artistic design on film since 1994. Yuh takes the screenplay by Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger and their team of writers and gives turns it into a gorgeous, poetic vision of ancient China with rich symbolism, gorgeous scenery and a magnificent series of flashbacks, including the opening sequence, employing various colorful gears to tell the story of Shen's origin. Having received a prophecy that he will be defeated by a creature of black and white, Shen begins a campaign to slaughter every panda alive in an effort to stave off his demise. His treachery and violence lead his loving and peaceful parents to exile him. Adding immeasurably to the magnificent visuals of the opening Michelle Yeoh's wonderful narration adds an beautiful layer of depth.

We know from the first film that Po's father Mr. Ping (Jame Hong) is not his natural father. A goose having a panda cub child? But the film didn't go into great depth about Po's origin leaving a terrific opening for the sequel. In order to find the inner peace he will need in order to defeat Shen, Po must calm the storms in his heart and uncover the truth about his parents and how he came to be the adoptive son of a goose. The flashback scenes peppered throughout the present tense action colorfully unveil his history, revealing a stark and tragic history that allows the audience to form an emotional connection with Po that they may not have had in the original film.

The voice work has changed little since the original film, but adding in Oldman's machinations as the voice of Shen was a stroke of genius. For several years, Oldman has softened his image, giving the audience a glimpse of the more compassionate side of his craft. With roles in the Harry Potter films as Harry's compassionate father and in the Batman films as the kindly Lieutenant Gordon, I had become concerned that we might forever lose the richness of character he could bring to a villainous role. Kung Fu Panda revives my faith in him as an actor. Shen is a cold-hearted villain like few others, but his vocal talents lend an air of menace the film might not have had with a lesser actor in the role. His voice work makes this one of his finest performances in years.

Not since Toy Story 2 has there been an animated sequel that has improved upon the original. Tonally, Kung Fu Panda 2 is quite a bit darker than its comedy-laden first feature, but that's to the benefit of the film. While it has many light moments that give the audience occasion to smile, adding too much levity to a story of such gravity would have been dangerous. They have created the perfect balance. It might not be the joyous production a lot of kids will enjoy, this film will appeal mostly to the adults whose support has frequently made Pixar the envy of the animation industry. While I doubt that Pixar can easily be supplanted as the best animation house in film history, DreamWorks is making the case that it isn't some fly-by-night, box office-at-all-costs studio like rival Fox.

With the Panda films and How to Train Your Dragon, I'm no longer afraid to sit down to a DreamWorks animated feature expecting to be annoyed by how childish it is, because I'm no longer likely to be so disappointed.",1377734400,2,4506,4.6545226130653266
7088839,5,B00VFVIJFG,"I ordered a new copy of Kung Fu Panda 2 from WELOVEBOOKS123.  I noticed the new price was close to the used price so I decided to buy new.  The seller sent me a copy that was so obviously worn, scratched, used, and had finger prints all over it and smudges, and the title was worn off the disk!  It wasn't even a good condition used copy!  Someone had put a shrink wrap on it trying to make it look new!  Immediately upon opening it was obvious there was a very beat up used copy in the case.

However, I wrote the company through Amazon regarding the problem, and they got back to me very quickly via email, and told me that they buy movies wholesale and this must have been a bad apple that they themselves unknowingly purchased.  They didn't have another copy to send me but they IMMEDIATELY issued a complete refund of the DVD AND shipping to my credit card, and said I could keep the DVD and they did not want me to send it back.  So, although it started out bad, this company really pulled through with their impressive customer service and I would feel safe purchasing from them in the future knowing that they will immediately address any problems I have.",1377561600,,1163,4.3271889400921655

All the original cast voices are still in this one too so that's another plus in my book.

i bought this believing there were two different movies i was buying,
not one movie with a subtitle and two differently recorded discs -
i am not at all sure why the two discs (what can i do with a blueray disc?) might be useful to me.

The way Dreamworks packages this, i was left with the impression that Kung Fu Panda 2 was one movie,
and Secrets of the Masters was another.
That is the only reason why i bought this version,
with the mistaken impression i was getting a better deal.
Otherwise i could have bought it for much less.

Kung Fu Panda 2 and Secrets of the Masters are the same movie. Don't be misled as i was!

7088885,4,B00VFVIJFG,"My review's going to take a little bit of a different direction so please, bear (get it?) with me.

Adoption usually gets some bad press in movies; if something goes horribly wrong or some person has an annoying tendency it might just be because they're adopted.  Adoption also is the butt of some admittedly funny jokes here and there but the driving point is still that there is something ""wrong"" with the adopted person and so adoption, no matter how noble, is an ultimately doomed endeavor.

How frustrating to the hundreds of thousands, millions even, of people who have adopted or been adopted and who are loved and loving.  Adopted or not we all have our faults.  So it is always refreshing to see a movie that doesn't just have a positive spin on adoption but whose adoption plot is an important feature of the movie.  And that's something that we have in Kung Fu Panda 2.  The somewhat dim Po, the lovable titular Panda voiced by Jack Black, is feeling the distance between he and his father goose (yes, literally his father is a goose for those of you who haven't seen this film).  Po loves and is loved by his dad, but he has questions about where he came from and what his biological parents were like and why they couldn't or didn't keep him.  These questions are answered over story's course and the villain this time around, a peacock (voiced by Gary Oldman) whose hidden blades and secrets of gunpoweder are far worse than his bite...er, peck, figures strongly into Po's biological backstory.

The violence and some of the heavier emotional tones make this a movie that perhaps is not a great fit for those under 6 although they would be pleased with it visually.  The heavier tones can be felt throughout with the darker color palettes chosen; there are ominous skies filled with dark billious smoke throughout and our heroes often find themselves operating in the twilight and nighttime hours where deep reds and oranges, and darker purples and shades of black abound.  This contrasts significantly with the first feature with its light and sun-soaked qualities.  Also this time around the humor is more forced and it's not quite as funny but I never found the first feature to be a laugh-fest mind you, just a movie that constantly put a smile on my face that stayed there for long periods of time.  By contrast this movie has more ""funny"" moments and one-liners, and Michelle Yeoh's character Soothsayer the goat has some of the funniest moments with her calm precognitive knowing which constantly upsets our bad peacock.

Overall this is a movie that could be a family favorite.  While I feel that it is inferior to the first on many levels it does possess the purposeful element of using Po's adoption as a bright and important story vehicle that maintains a positive message, and that's something that I truly appreciate.",1364256000,,2844,4.72672064777328

I found extremely mild ghosting on background objects when viewed on my active 3D set. It's not distracting in the least. The 3D darkens the image in some night scenes, but not nearly as bad as other 3D I've seen.

The 2D is crisp and clear, with great color and detail. Sound is great, this disc (like the 3D) makes very good use of surround sound.

The movie itself is unexpectedly charming, and more mature than I expected. Not mature in a way inappropriate for kids, just more sophisticated in humor, action, and character development.

Kung Fu Panda 2 was funny, acerbic, witty, sad, and completely enthralling! Watching a roly-poly panda take his kung-fu to another level is heart-warming - and scary!

The voices for the various characters could not be more spot on. Jack Black has raised the bar for animation voices so high I'm not sure it will ever be beat!!! (I will add an aside here for Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum/Smeagol in LOTR however, although, technically, I don't consider that ""animation"" such as this. Gollum was on another level entirely!)

One slight note of caution; 1 of my granddaughters is 2 1/2, and I think this may be just a little too much fighting for her. It should be fine for 4 or 4 1/2 +, though.",1358380800,,948,4.344632768361582

The music is also awesome, heck I've listened to its soundtrack a million times! I'm also glad that they didn't use the same story arc ""Shrek 2"" and ""Madagascar 2"" did with meeting the real parents, so I am glad they twisted this one up a bit. The kung fu comedy is also great, Po and Tigress's new relationship is great, I could go on. At first, I wasn't excited about a peacock being the villain as much as I liked a snow leopard being the villain, but once I watched Lord Shen, I thought he was a much more sinister villain than someone like Tai Lung. I also thought the Wolf Leader guy with the hammer was pretty cool too. He reminds me a lot of Fidget the bat from ""The Great Mouse Detective"". What else can I say? The characters are great, the music is great, the CGI is great, the list goes on. I enjoyed watching it and I'll definetly be watching this DVD so much more.",1355875200,,1160,4.183035714285714

Despite an A-lister cast (Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, etc.) the film blessedly never lampshades the actors. Gary Oldman is especially awesome as the sinister peacock Shen. Yes, a peacock, and he's an excellent villain.

7088941,4,B00VFVIJFG,"In my opinion DreamWorks has always played second fiddle to Pixar in the computer generated feature film genre.  Their rivalry has existed for nearly as long as there has been a computer generated feature film genre! Pixar had Toy Story, DreamWorks had Small Soldiers. Pixar had A Bug's Life, DreamWorks Antz. Pixar Monsters Inc., DreamWorks Monsters Vs. Aliens.  Pixar with Cars and DreamWorks with Trucks.  No wait, I made that last one up.  But you get the idea.

It seems to me like DreamWorks' best efforts are the ones that don't have a direct Pixar counterpart: The Shrek saga and How to Train Your Dragon to mention a few.  I am of the stance that 2008's Kung-Fu Panda perfectly represents this phenomenon of high-quality DreamWorks originality.

What we had there was a bit of tribute to the Kung-Fu classics with a lot of unexpected character charm to cement the intense action sequences and lovely visuals.  When I heard a sequel was in the works, I naturally feared for the worst.  Generally speaking sequels in the CG film arena are hit or miss (with emphasis on miss).  Ever see Space Chimps 2, Hoodwinked 2 or Open Season 2 (or even scarier, Open Season 3)?  Sure you have your Shreks & Toy Stories but more often than not it seems to me that animation studios have a hard time recapturing the magic of the originals; especially when the original contains the ever-illusive element of heart.

That said Kung-Fu Panda 2, riding on the success of the first one, was given a budget increase to the tune of 20-mil ($150,000,000 versus 130,000,000), brought back all of the key members of the original cast (with a few new ones) and even retained the vast majority of the production & animator crew.  To summarize, DreamWorks made darn sure not to risk losing said heart of the first film.  Did they succeed? For the most part absolutely.  Viewers looking for something more grandiose may be disappointed but the good news here is that Kung-Fu Panda 2 succeeds at feeling more like a continuation of the first film than it does a genuine sequel.  And considering the first film ended in such a manner where a sequel wasn't necessary, this is a very good thing indeed.

Jack Black reprises his role as the titular overweight martial-arts trainee panda and his entire Furious Five retinue return uninterrupted (Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross)). Series staples Dustin Hoffman as Po's master Shifu and James Hong as Po's noodle-peddling dad return as well. The villain is new this time; a sociopath peacock named Shen, and played to perfection by Gary Oldman.  Other noteworthy additions include casting real-life karate aficionado Jean-Claude Van Damme to play Master Croc.

The story takes us back to the visually lush Valley of Peace and finds a newfound camaraderie between Po and his Furious Five cohorts.  At just about the same time Po suddenly realizes that he bears (no pun intended, for now) no physical resemblance to his dad, the villainous Shen surfaces with a weapon of mass destruction and plans to conquer all of China.

In terms of scope, the bar has been raised slightly but it's clear that the focus here was to expand upon the character back-stories and their interaction with one another over expanding geographically strictly for the sake of spending some of that additional 20-mil.

The plot thickens slightly once Po realizes Shen's ambitions and the fact that he doesn't remember his birth parents aren't completely unrelated occurrences.  Unfortunately though, canceling out the slightly deeper plot structure of the sequel is the fact that Po's clumsy, lighthearted enthusiasm seems somehow misplaced now that he has been revealed a psychologically scarred Kung Fu disciple.

Pacing is decent, if a bit longer feeling than the first, though all in all the 90-minute runtime does go by fairly quickly since no time need be wasted setting up backgrounds for our heroes.  Hans Zimmer nails the musical score with his trademarked near-subliminally perfect melodies and heart thumping action accompaniments.

In all Kung-Fu Panda joins a pretty slim gathering of titles that actually manage to do the concept of a sequel justice.  While it could be argued that DreamWorks played it safe by failing to stray from the path established in the first one, at least they knew not to fix what wasn't broken.  The old phrase, ""it's not as original as the original"" certainly applies as well but here's hoping the formula continues to stay fresh as DreamWorks has stated they hope to milk this into a 6-movie franchise.  Will fans tire of Po's antics through four more films? There's a swamp-dwelling big green ogre who thinks not.",1342742400,,4728,4.926860025220681
7088942,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Where do I begin? For starters, I have to say that Kung Fu Panda 2 (formerly called ""The Kaboom of Doom"") outdid its predecessor in every way, in my opinion, except for maybe laughs. And that's saying a mouthful because I love the first film. Kung Fu Panda is one of my favorite animated films, so I was very eagerly awaiting this one's release. I can honestly say I don't mind the lack of big laughs one bit. I never really found the first very funny either. Its humor cater has always catered more to a demographic that's quite a few years behind me anyway. That being said, I still do laugh a few times whenever I pop the first one in, and not so much with the sequel. Nevertheless, genuine heart fills the void that the lack of substantial comedy left behind. Kung Fu Panda 2 has an extra dosage of emotional oomph that many animated films strive for, but rarely achieve. Meaning it leaves a mark on you, making you feel sorry for our lead, Po (Jack Black). After How To Train Your Dragon, I knew DreamWorks was on the right path to eventually being close to, if not on par with Pixar. Don't get me wrong, I love some of the films in their library, but there's an obvious difference between an everlasting classic film and a simply entertaining one. How To Train Your Dragon and Kung Fu Panda 2 have officially allowed DreamWorks to attain the former two years in a row. Now what's a kung fu movie with exciting fight scenes?

The kung fu is aplenty in Kung Fu Panda 2, and the sequences are spectacular. Needless to say, the action is thrilling. The choreography is very well done, albeit a little difficult to make out the first couple of times you watch the film. I can confidently say that this is one of my favorite kung fu movies. To be fair, I'm not well versed in the subgenre, so maybe m claim means little. The characters are so natural and believable. Top notch voice work by the entire cast. Jack Black really cares about Po, and it shows. His subtly is sublime. Every little nuance in his voice comes through and clearly translates to create our lovable hero Po. These animation studios are really getting good at facial tweaks, especially the eyes. There's so much soul and life behind the characters' eyes. Besides Jack Black, there is a stellar group of names including: Dustin Hoffman returning as the wise Yoda-like Shifu (even down to the walking stick - Master Oogway's staff) , Angelina Jolie as Tigress the fearless leader of the Furious Five, Seth Rogen as Mantis (showing even more growth in his voice work talent), Lucy Liu as Viper, David Cross as Crane, Jackie Chan as Monkey, and James Hong as Mr. Ping, rounding out the returning support. The newcomers are Gary Oldman playing yet another villain to perfection in Shen, the always funny (but more menacing in this case) Danny McBride as the one-eyed Wolf Boss, Dennis Haysbert as a commanding Master Ox, and the only other kung fu legend in the film besides Chan, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Master Croc.

I'm a big fan of animated movies, and as an artist I took note of the various creative ways that the scenes were painted onto the canvas, or screen. One major strength I loved about Kung Fu Panda was how beautifully they used colors and shapes to tell the story. The sequel is no different. The scenery in this movie pops to perfection in each of its different striking art styles. Be it classic and drawn-esque, or state of the art CGI, this movie is simply a beautiful sight to behold. The color palette is darker than the first because the story is darker. This sequel takes our characters down an Empire Strikes Back, Temple of Doom sort of path. These characters that we grew to love in the light-hearted, fun first entries must then go to new lengths - emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually - in the sequels. In this film, Po get tested in ways that I never expected a character as care-free, adventurous, and fun loving to be. Kung Fu Panda 2 revolves around him learning to master the ancient art of inner peace, a lesson that doesn't come easily to put it lightly. Simply put, I loved it. Once again, the Hans Zimmer and John Powell's score adds a lot to the visuals, which are amazing. We've come to expect nothing short of the best A/V presentations from animated releases, and I am happy to say that Kung Fu Panda 2 delivers. Truly a top notch release in pretty much every department. I highly recommend it.

7088944,4,B00VFVIJFG,"I really liked the original `Kung Fu Panda'.  It was cute and the animation was really top notch.  Now that my daughter is older and has become obsessed with the television show (yes, obsessed is HER word for the matter) I've come to have a shaky feeling about the idea of having her watch a cartoon whose sole purpose is to depict martial arts being used on everyone.  Sure, it's the age old `good versus evil' which is kind of used in every cartoon, regardless of tone, but there is something about the excitement of watching someone get beat up that should be reserved for teenage boys, right?  I don't know, I mean, the film is cute and has charm and it is funny in many parts, but the overall feel I get is one of discomfort as the character's punch and kick and fight to the death on numerous occasions.

Call me a prude or call me a parent, but at times I feel they should go hand in hand.

But, as a film I kind of liked this.  It was just as good as the original, which is a tough hurdle to cross for almost every sequel.  The animation is stellar and the character development is just as tightly etched here as it was in the original, which is a nice bonus.  The storyline has similarities to the original (really, it is a formula that is regurgitated countless times and yet it feels freshly done here, which is nice) and I was pleased to see that the original cast returned.  I just hate it when they cast new actors to play previous characters.  In the end, I am iffy on recommending this because of the violence level, but each parent knows their child and so they can make that decision for themselves.  As a film itself, this is a good one.  It has its own identity and personality, and that is a rarity these days.",1341446400,,1731,4.256880733944954

7088946,5,B00VFVIJFG,"***This review may contain spoilers***

  Most of Dreamworks's animated efforts have complacently settled for being rousing, diverting, and knowingly satirical action-and-violence stories, but not especially memorable (thinking about Shark Tale, for example).  Occasionally, some of their movies leaven all the crazy action and movement with important themes, like the meaning of isolation and innate virtue and love in the Shrek movies.  However, at the pinnacle of Dreamworks's animated features is one that poignantly delves into the character of a seemingly silly, corpulent, and superficial panda who somehow possesses devastating martial arts skills.  Yes, Kung Fu Panda 2 (hereafter KFP2) has all the action, color, adventure, and conflict of its lesser Dreamworks cousins, but it is also profoundly different. Besides being a chop-socky martial arts adventure for the kiddies, KFP2 offers food for thought for more mature viewers, namely, the importance of balance (or yes, master, yin and yang) for a full and healthy life.

  At the beginning of KFP2, it appears that the panda, Po (voice of Jack Black), has that full and healthy life.  He is now the accomplished dragon warrior and leader of kung fu wizards the Furious Five, and has the respect and admiration of his sensei Master Shifu (voice of Dustin Hoffman), and the loving supervision of his restauranteur father Ping (voice of James Hong).  But in the Furious Five's latest mission to prevent a horde of wolves from looting metal from a local village, Po's confrontation with the Boss Wolf (voice of Danny McBride) triggers a disturbing memory that knocks him off his stride and lets the wolves get away.  As the usually cheerful Po solemnly ponders these memories which seem to show a wolf attack on a village and two parent pandas leaving their baby behind, those memories intertwine with the machinations of the latest garden-variety megalomaniac, Lord Shen (voice of Gary Oldman).  Shen is a colorless peacock who, partly fueled by resentment against parents he sees as stifling, wishes to conquer China and perhaps the world.  Although adept at kung fu, Shen plans to use weapons and artillery to attack, hence the minion wolves' metal raid.  Thus, if we are careful, we see both the main protagonist and antagonist (Po and Shen) as ""unbalanced"" individuals seeking to stabilize themselves.  The genius of KFP2 is its demonstration that, in a way, each needs the other for balance.

  Nagging at the back of Po's mind is the realization that Ping cannot be his true father.  But as his dreams gradually show, HE was that baby panda abandoned by his parents in the radish box as the wolves attacked.  That box gradually made its way to Ping's shop.  Since Po's parents did not arrive to claim the child, Ping raised Po as his own, with the usual frustrations and complications.  Po is grateful to Ping, but he is out of balance because he can't understand why his parents would leave him.  A calm, unperturbed, ram seer (voice of Michelle Yeoh) eventually shows Po that Shen instigated the attack on his parents' village and that they had to abandon him for his own safety.  But instead of easing his mind, this knowledge awakens feelings of vengeance against Shen and unbalances Po further.

  Furthermore, the ram seer nominally works for Shen and constantly reminds him that a force of black and white (i.e. panda Po) will be his undoing and that he should refrain from his conquest.  Shen petulantly and arrogantly refuses to listen. Who - Po or Shen - will embrace balance and, by association, inner peace as exemplified by Master Shifu?  The ram seer advises Po not to obsess on the past but to improve on and develop the present and future.  You know, let it go, and go on.  Does Po listen?  You will see when you witness the climactic confrontration between Po and the Furious Five, and Shen's armed armada sailing down the river to the sea.

  KFP2 is an astoundingly towering tour-de-force.  It takes the standard worn-out martial arts trope, and balances it with respect of ancient Chinese geography, architecture, and philosophy.  It shows ALL its anthropomorphic characters with multifaceted, sometimes opposite, characteristics (serious and playful) striving to keep them working together.  Finally, KFP2 shows us that balanced inner peace is one of humanity's greatest gifts, symbolized by the familiar black and white yin and yang symbol. Po is of course black and white.  Does he eventually symbolize that peaceful yin and yang?  Again, watch the climactic battle, and you will definitely find out.

  With this consoling philosophy, KFP2 is a considerable, Pixar-level production, and promises to continue to do so with its sequel-hinting final shot, which promises more conflict but also more consolation for Po.",1339027200,,4805,5.081736909323117
7088947,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Kung Fu Panda 2 will NOT disappoint those who were big fans of the first one.  In fact the sequel is more action-oriented (in some cases overwhelmingly so!).  Right from the very beginning we're introduced with a fighting segment involving our favorite panda bear named Po.  His friends from the first one return and find themselves in the same zanny and outrageous situations as before.  Without giving it a second thought, they help Po whenever danger calls.

In this adventure, Po has to battle a peacock who's less than friendly.  In fact this peacock is ruler of the land and calls the shots.  Once he and Po meet, the peacock insists they've met before but Po disagees.  As a result, hilarious lines are exchanged between the two and some of the most explosive fighting scenes appear soon after.  The peacock wants him destroyed but of course, that can't happen!  No way!

What makes this storyline different from the first one is how it centers around Po's childhood and particularly how he was abandoned by his parents.  Po is aware of his mysterious past and wants to find out more about it.  He sets out in search of clues and realizes the peacock is the one who has the answers but... Po gets a not-so welcoming interaction whenever he gets too nosey and finds himself caught up in the peacocks business.  Another interesting feature is that there's very little training- Po is already fully charged and ready to take down anything with his ""skills"".  You can probably guess why I put ""skills"" in quotation marks- the way Po knocks out the bad guys is based entirely on being in the right place at the right time with all the right objects surrounding him!

Overall, fans of animation will be mighty impressed with the creative visuals that constantly remain full steam ahead, and this is honestly how a sequel *should* be done.  It's exciting from beginning to end.  Highly recommended for all families.",1337990400,,1915,4.734138972809668

There were heros and a villan making the story itself pretty standard fare.  The fun part was getting the character's defined, building up to a final, victorious showdown.  Well, Kung Fu Panda 2, was not the same; not at all.  I found it to be a very disjointed story, a little difficult to follow, and it also had more than one story going on.  Plus it seemed to me that half of the show was dark in theme and also too many scenes shown in Literal darkness.

The second one was almost as good, but I found my mind wandering on occasion, though I watched it under the same circumstances as the first. The entire cast maintains the sense of fun and commitment, and I was very entertained.

It's not Shrek or Wall-E, but certainly as good as Rango, regarding a little guy up against seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Little kids can learn from that, and adult ""kids"" as well, if they pay attention and don't write it off as insignificant. Animated films are not the same as ""cartoons"".

7088970,4,B00VFVIJFG,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

OOS EFFECTS:
There are about 110 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. There are about 42 from 15% - 20%, 32 at 25%, 7 at 30%, 4 at 40% and 2 at 50%. These are some large numbers but the bulk of the OOS effects are very quick.

IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:
Like most of the newer animated 3D films, the in-screen 3D looks very good but I found the background lacking at times. The shading and detail of the characters are an enhancement to the 3D experience.

I rarely comment on video content but as an adult viewer I was unimpressed by the storyline. IMO the film is geared for a young audience but conversely has a large amount of cartoon violence.

ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:
There is some crosstalk sprinkled throughout the film but most of it is barely noticeable by being hidden within objects.
(crosstalk varies from system to system)

MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

Outraged by his combat failure, the Five and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) inform him that he is not to join them in their duties.

This knowledge shacks him to foundations. Can Po find the inter-peace he need to master, in order to save both his art and Nation?

The Story is does build on the first and add more action and comedy, showing growth of each character.

The action and comedy pays tribute to many kung Fu and comedy legends.

Jeepers! What's going to happen? Adults know what's coming and kids will love it so even though it's predictable in a lot of places it's all in good fun.

7089008,4,B00VFVIJFG,"This review of the film, Kung Fu Panda 2, has a slight twist as it is a review from a self development point of view. In essence, Kung Fu Panda 2 has two main stories. The first is the fight against an evil peacock who wants to destroy Kung Fu. The second is about the Panda's roots, i.e., who he is, where he is from, his search for inner peace, his journey of self discovery, etc. The film has many messages at this deeper level and its self development lessons are very applicable to the human world.

KUNG FU PANDA 2 - BACKGROUND

Po (the Kung Fu Panda) and the Furious Five (Crane, Mantis, Monkey, Tigress and Viper) from the first Kung Fu Panda film now have to deal with a new villain (Lord Shen) who has turned up with a new weapon to take over the kingdom. In addition, Po now wants to find out the truth about his roots and embarks on a hunt for 'inner peace'. In the end, it is this that helps him to defeat Shen.

There are many reviews on Kung Fu Panda 2 that cover the exciting action scenes, 3D animation, cinematography, lighting, art direction, writing, spectacular choreography, great sound track (Hans Zimmer), stunning visuals, beautiful landscapes and backgrounds, interesting characters, brilliant colours, etc. Then there is the first class casting of the A-list voices of Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman, Jack Black, Jackie Chan, James Hong, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Lucy Liu, Michelle Yeoh, Seth Rogen and others.

In addition to all that, throughout the film are little gems of wisdom with some poignant messages covering ambition, family bonds, loyalty, friendship, moral values, etc. This particular review concentrates on the self development lessons that the film offers.

KUNG FU PANDA 2 - SELF DEVELOPMENT LESSONS

* What you search for may be closer than you think

In Po's hunt for 'inner peace' he searches far and wide for it. In the end he finds that this is, and has always been, within himself.

* Your past is not your present

Po discovers the truth about his background which makes him question who he really is and what pathways his life is now going to take. He eventually realises that you simply become who you choose to be.

* Confront fear to destroy it

Po has several fears which he pushes aside. Once he decides to confront them he begins to understand where they came from and everything is put into perspective. When you face your inner demons this allows your inner powers and strength to shine through.

* Know what you want

Po only becomes really powerful once he decides what he truly wants in life. Once you figure out where you are heading and for what reason, you will find the tools to get you there.

* A still mind will accomplish much more

Once Po stops doubting, worrying, fearing, etc., his mind becomes clear and he is able to see his way forward. If you can clear your mind of such distractions this clarity of mind will reveal pathways that you had not seen before.

* You can achieve what you put your mind to

Po started his journey as an overweight Panda with no martial arts skills. Through sheer hard work and total focus he is able to conquer the most evil villain. If you have determination and strength of mind you can achieve your desires. You are the master of your destiny.

* Never give up

Even though Po is constantly criticized and experiences much hardship, he keeps persevering towards his ultimate goal. In life accept that there will always be obstacles and hardships. Persevere through these, believe in yourself and you will achieve your dreams.

* A true team can achieve wonders

Po is able to achieve his greatest desires by working with his team of true friends who help him to develop his weaknesses and achieve greatness. If you have people around you who accept you for who you are and work with you with no jealousy, hang-ups, etc., you will have maximum success.

* You are here for a unique reason

Po is confused about his role in life. As the story unfolds he starts to see that he does indeed have a mission and his destiny becomes clear. You may not always know your purpose in life but once you discover your destiny you start to live a happier and more fulfilled life.

KUNG FU PANDA 2 - SELF DEVELOPMENT SUMMARY

There are many reviews of Kung Fu Panda 2. This review has concentrated on the self development lessons that the film offers. The part of the story that deals with Po's search for inner peace and his journey of self discovery has many messages at a deeper level and its self development lessons are very applicable to the human world.",1326067200,,4579,4.561660561660561
7089009,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Kung Fu Panda 2 is a continuation of the first movie and Po is part of the Dragon Warrior team. Po's skills are improving but he is still not the master that Tigress is for example.  His master tells him that he has to learn to focus and learn inner peace.  Po's tactic is to charge into the fight instead of developing a strategy and analyzing the enemy.

An evil warrior enemy is threatening to take over all of China and when his evil warriors start to steal materials to make a secret weapon the Dragon Warrior team jumps in to stop them.  When Po sees the warriors he starts having flashbacks about his origins and where he came from.  This causes a lack of self-confidence and this is exactly what Po does not need when confronting a powerful enemy.

This is a good storyline with Good facing Evil and how Po must be brave and find his inner self to become the warrior he needs to be to defeat his enemy.  Po's transition from a Dragon Warrior to a powerful Kung Fu master is fun and interesting. The graphics in this movie are wonderful and make the movie.  It is an exciting action movie with comedy and fun built in!",1326067200,,1125,4.298578199052133

But in many ways the second is better, even though the story is not as strong and the humor seems forced at time.

The production value are top notch.  The visuals and animation are stunning.  The story really grows on you; certain parts really moved me.  The voice acting is superb.  There are several moments of brilliance no one can deny.

The movie has a few more lows than the original, but the higher peaks more than make up for it.

7089014,3,B00VFVIJFG,"The original Kung Fu Panda movie gets five stars and ranks among my favorite animated films despite what some have called a formulaic storyline.  It combines a well-executed story with heart, impressive animation, creative action scenes, strong characters voiced by a great cast, and is topped off with a lush score by Hans Zimmer.  I was happy when I heard there was going to be a sequel.

Kung Fu Panda 2 is a decent movie, but, sadly, feels more like an attempt to cash in on the success of its predecessor than an honest effort to craft another fine tale from the elements of the first.  We are quickly shown a backstory, using 2D animation, to get us to the central conflict of the story, which, strangely, seems like an indirect threat to our heros at best and someone else's problem at worst.  Gone from this sequel's storyline is a theme worthy of the original's: ""There is no secret ingredient--it's just you.""  That thoughtful subtext was cleverly arrived at through two story elements: The secret-ingredient soup and the film's MacGuffin--the Dragon Scroll.  In KFP2, we're treated to Po's journey for ""inner peace""--which really just falls in his lap at the end rather than developing naturally from his experiences in the film.  There is a side story about Po's attempt to find out who his biological family is, which helps flesh out his backstory.  However, the development of the other characters is more shallow this time around; the villain especially feels underdeveloped.  Even the humor falls short of the original.  The animation looks very good, but there's nothing to top the creatively choreographed action of the first, such as Tai Lung's exciting jail-break or Po's showdown with him later.

In checking KFP2's credits, I see that the screenwriters are the same as for the original, but there's a new director: Jennifer Yuh, who is a relative newcomer to directing.  It's hard to say if the blame falls with her or with the screenwriters who were just unable to capture lightning in a bottle for a second time.  KFP2's ending suggests we're in for a third installment.  I'm hopeful a third film will have a lot more of the magic found in the first one.",1325635200,,2178,4.801608579088472

7089018,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Since there are such long reviews I'll make this pretty short.  I thought the first one was pretty good, not comparable to some Pixar films, but still good.  The sequel goes another level in terms of story, action, animation quality and humor.  The writers flesh out more about Po and it's pretty heartwarming especially between him and his father.  Although only Po and Tigress relationship is touched on there's enough development to be interesting.  Gary Oldman does a great villian and the character is well written.  Action is bolder and the humor is great.  Sometimes onliners come off very corny or predictable, but these were well timed and witty.

I purchased this collection of 3D/2D/DVD and digital video from Best Buy for $35. The quality of 3D is just simply SUPERB. In each and every scene there are clearly very high quality 3D effects, and in a few scenes, some very nice OOS effects. I saw this first in 2D, and the quality of color, black levels, clarity were all amazing, but it is in 3D it is ""pure awesomeness"" to quote Po (and my kids!)!

7089023,5,B00VFVIJFG,"I was a Kung Fu Panda fan straight away after the first film. (I actually purchased the Panda-monium double pack that included a second DVD about each member of the Furious Five.) This time around, I decided to just get the single edition, as the 2nd disc for the first film seemed rather childish. I absolutely loved this film.

The story had a lot more grit, or what can be considered grit for a Family genre film. From Lord Shen's past to the brutal truth of Po's family, the entire thing takes a step up from movie one.
There was also more kung fu, a lot more. The real styles of each warrior were demonstrated in various scenes, this time with more actual delivery instead of being stuck between Jack Black's jokes and catchphrases.

And yes, for anyone wondering, Skadoosh makes a reprise.",1325030400,,795,4.5524475524475525
7089024,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Before I get to the movie, I want to mention what a great deal the bundle is.  In our house, we have blu-ray plays, DVD players, iPads, etc so the bundle of blu-ray disk, DVD, and digital copy, really makes sense.  Regardless of where we want to watch the movie, we have a copy of for each device. When you buy a movie, you shouldn't have to worry about how you'll play it on various devices and this bundle frees you from that concern. The digital copy is great when we are traveling and need to keep the kids attention occupied for awhile.  I hope they continue to do these bundles for all movies that are released.

In terms of the movie itself its quite good. Without including any spoilers, it continues the story it started in the original movie and it adds additional layers to the story by revealing some of the Panda's past (it also sets the stage for future movie(s) as well). The movie is an audio and visual experience, with great music and very high quality animation. The story is rich enough where the kids are entertained but so are the parents, which I appreciate having seen so many of these kids movies.  I highly recommend the movie because it has messages that are good for kids.",1325030400,,1200,4.411764705882353

The first one was funny, witty, clever, and fun.

This movie is just a lot of animated kung fu, and fight scenes that seem endless (not in a good way).

I rarely write reviews, but I was truly anticipating watching this movie with my kids - we had so much fun watching, and re-watching, the original Kung Fu Panda. Sure, there's a little back story about Po, but there is none of the newness of the first. In short, skip it - unless you are really into the kung fu - in which case you'll appreciate the long long long fight scenes.

7089031,4,B00VFVIJFG,"Positives:
(1.) Notable for the accurate historical Chinese culture inclusion into the milieu of the movie.
(2.) The CGI attention to detail and historical accuracy for the intermediate scenes such as the structures, buildings, everyday living accoutrements e.g. the limestone cliffs of the, presumably, Yangtze River and the breaking of clay roof tiles when Po lands on them.
(3.) The movement, Kung Fu and other action scenes were novel and fresh and entertaining in this movie's interpretation e.g. the Pac-Man dragon in the streets maze.
(4.) Most of the voicing was appropriate but there were times, especially in the beginning, that I thought a couple of professional voicing actors might have been more interesting if not more dramatic.
(5.) Humor, parodies and sarcasms were performed with the right degree of subtlety to entice an older discerning audience e.g. parodies of ""Star Wars"" Yoda; ""Karate Kid"" 1's, ""wax on wax off"" and ""Red Cliffs"".

Negatives:
(1.) Background CGI such as clouds, mountains were typical anim&eacute; non-moving, flat 2-D in detail. The characters even with somewhat good facial and body movement lacked the individual details that would make them seem real enough to hold on to. Especially emotional attachment. Not up to ""Rango"" level, but no one else has been there either.
(2.) Storyline was a bit timeworn and seemed borrowed from the plots of many other movies.  The abandoned then adopted youngster who is destined to grow up to seek a true identity and perhaps correct some wrongs upon the evil perpetuator.",1324080000,,1552,5.179282868525896

The problem with that is the adult aspect of it is too watered down for adults to take and the rest is not childish enough for the kids to really enjoy.  I was never a fan of the first one but my kids were.  Watching this one we all thought it was kinda boring.  If they would have gone for more of Po hurting himself like the first one they would have liked it better.  Sequels to kids movies try to actually be different from the first one, and that's why so many fail.

Aliens or the movie that may be the epitome of all things cute, How to Train Your Dragon. So nail me to the cross if you want. I also have, in recent times, developed a distaste for sequels. This year we had Pixar's first terrible movie (Cars 2), the disastrously messy Pirates 4, and the carbon copy Hangover 2 (though Deathly Hallows Part 2 is my pick for top movie of 2011)

So while I, as I stated, enjoyed KFP1, I initially had low expectations for it's sequel in place. And with that in mind, I can say I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda 2. Although it's not perfect, it managed to be very entertaining, and a worthy follow up.

The sequel takes place some time after the first movie. Po has continued training to be a true Kung Fu master, but there's one thing he hasn't yet truly mastered: inner peace. Of course, to a panda like Po, Kung Fu is all about kicking butt, but he soon learns that the only way to be a true Kung Fu master is to be at peace with himself. However, a new gang, sent in by a Peacock who seems a ghost of Po's past, has terrorized the village, sending Po and the gang on an adventure to stop him.

Kung Fu Panda 2 works... for the most part. The good news is, it overall provides for an entertaining ride that the whole family can enjoy. The script is filled with tons of funny lines that are bound to have the kids repeating them for hours on end. As well as the voice cast is just as charming this time around; Jack Black still manages to charm as Po, Angelina Jolie still manages to put her street tough kick to good use. However, Gary Oldman, as usual, steals the show. He makes a great villain andit shows.

The animation also manages to dazzle. I can safely say that the animation quality has come a long way since Shrek. I didn't see this in 3D, but I guarantee I would have loved to. There are a lot of moments in the animation where I wanted to reach out and run my fingers through Po's fur, or move my hand along the cannon near the end, and had I seen this movie in 3D, I probably would have reached out and tried to feel them! It reminded me of when I saw Sanctum in 3D earlier this year, where I felt like I was actually underwater.

However there are a few flaws that prevent me from calling it a perfect film, let alone near perfect. For starters, it took me a while to be able to connect with the movie, as the pacing unfortunately is rushed to the point where it moves at a machine gun pace. Thepacing does slighty slow down in the middle but even then, the film still feels like the filmmakers were trying to cram too much in. Also, the story seemed convoluted. There was a story but it was rushed, to the point where I had myself questioning halfway through the film what the movie was about.

Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very enjoyable film that is not without it's flaws. I would say go into it with an open mind, and don't expect Pixar level entertainment. Oh, and even if you don't go to movies for the actors, it's still worth seeing for Gary Oldman alone.

Overall: 7/10

Pros: The film provides good action, humour, laughs, alongside a stellar voice cast, a terrific Hans Zimmer score and beautiful animation that would convince even 3D skeptics to buy a ticket.

Cons: The film's pacing is rushed, to the near point of being disorienting, as well as the story could have been more fleshed out as well as the villain.",1311379200,3,3578,4.204081632653061
7089044,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Before I begin, you should know that since Toy Story my family and I have loved animated movies. We've always preferred Pixar to DreamWorks because the former is usually more family appropriate with the exception of The Incredibles. DreamWorks always has some questionable material in their movies i.e. crude humor, innuendos, language, etc... It wasn't till recently with Kung Fu Panda that DreamWorks that people want family appropriate movies for kids. Last year, How to Train Your Dragon came out and I realized: I like this movie! It was clean, not too violent, and a great movie over all! I didn't know how DreamWorks was gonna pull off a better movie. Then, along came Kung Fu Panda 2, the Citizen Kane of animated movies. There are 6 reasons that Kung Fu Panda 2 is the best animated movie.
1. Story Line: Now I don't want to spoil anything but in my opinion, this plot was great! It had some pretty good twists for a kid's movie.
2. Fights: There was some pretty sweet kung fu fighting scenes almost as good as Jet Li's Fearless! The cooperation fight scenes were very original and very well crafted. One thing I would like to have seen more is some more one on one fighting. Other then that, spectacular choreography
3. Animation: The animation on How to Train Your Dragon was pretty eye popping. The animation for Kung Fu Panda 2? Even better. Fur/hair/feathers all bend in the wind like it would on an actually animal. When wet, the fur looks wet! On the topic of water, it's some of the best looking water in an animated movie. Moves like water and looks like water. And now we come to, I believe, DreamWorks strongest area: Explosions, smoke and dust. If you saw Megamind and How to Train Your Dragon, you know what I'm talking about. It looks so cool! The smoke billows like smoke and the dust settles like dust. When it comes to this area, DreamWorks rocks!
4. Voice Casting: The actors they picked for this movie were not great. They were awesome! They fit their character perfectly. Jack Black stole the show in the first movie. In this one, he's even better but loses to Gary Oldman, who plays the albino peacock Lord Shen. He plays his role so well when I see Lord Shen, I see Gary Oldman! My only negative comment is I would've wished to see Dustin Hoffman/Shifu play a bigger role.
5. Emotional Rapport: When it comes to emotions in animated movies, Pixar usually gets mine pretty involved i.e. Up. Kung Fu Panda 2 gets your emotions involved a lot. I don't want to spoil anything, but it was probably the saddest animated movie I've ever seen! But not too sad! It also has lots of hilarious moments, embarrassing moments and (surprisingly) some dark moments. As I said previously, Gary Oldman does a spectacular job playing a crazy peacock and he may creep some little kids out. So, be warned.
6. Music: The music is very well done. Beautiful, funny, exciting and sad, John Powell and Hans Zimmer have done an even better job then the first movie! I would strongly recommend buying this music if you enjoy soundtrack.
So there you have it! DreamWorks can do some clean, emotional and epic movies. And from what I've heard, the 3D is pretty good also. Enjoy this great movie.",1310601600,2,3197,4.610526315789474
7089045,5,B00VFVIJFG,"Well, I took my family to see Kung Fu Panda 2, and we all thought it was at least as good as the first film. It is engrossing, touching, clever, and much of the time absolutely hilarious. We had seen that the critics all panned it, and had high hopes because they are quite often wrong. Of course, it depends on how you judge these things. A lot of the surprise element is inevitably lost now that we know Po is, indeed, the Dragon Warrior in spite of his ungainly appearance and humble behaviour. And it must have been hard for the director and scriptwriters to define his new status vis a vis Shifu and the Furious Five. Furthermore - as a lot of comments here have pointed out - how on earth could they follow an act as supremely vicious and powerful as Ian McShane's Tai Lung?

All those problems are resolved in Kung Fu Panda 2 - and, I think, very satisfactorily indeed. The main dramatic engine is, of course, the villain, and Gary Oldman's rendering of the peacock Lord Shen is right up there with McShane's performance as Tai Lung. True, the peacock is not a supreme Kung Fu fighter - although he is pretty good - but he over-compensates for that by introducing mechanisation. Cleverly exploiting the fact that gunpowder and fireworks were first invented in China, the writers conceive the happy idea of making Shen set up a full-fledged production line devoted to turning out huge cannon. As Shifu and others explain, Shen's artillery has the potential to overthrow Kung Fu for once and for all - so Po and the Furious Five are fighting, not just for themselves, their friends, and the people of a conquered city, but to maintain the supremacy of their religion and their way of life. Necessarily - because cannon do not make or haul themselves - Shen commands a sizeable army of wolves and gorillas (which appear to have flat-top haircuts suggestive of the US military). So, although personally less scary than Tai Lung, he is a far more formidable enemy.

Within the constraints of a 91-minute film, an incredible amount of action takes place. After an efficient scene-setting, in which we see Shen's falling-out with his parents and his determination to seek revenge even beyond the grave, Po and the Five are dispatched by Shifu to deal with Shen and his miscellaneous artifacts and henchthings. Meanwhile, Po reflects (in his copious free time) on the task Shifu has set him: to seek ""Inner Peace"". Hugely outnumbered, at a great disadvantage because of Shen's artillery, and even out-thought by the wily bird, the friends seem to be up against it. But, needless to say, at the exactly perfect moment everything comes together for Po... Meanwhile the jokes come thick and fast - although you will perhaps find the film more amusing if you enjoy running gags, of which there are plenty.

It is certainly true that Kung Fu Panda 2 is darker, and there is mention of death. Indeed, it is central to the psychological aspect of the plot, as Po finds out more about where he came from and his parents. However, I noticed that the almost-empty cinema contained several small children - one little girl of perhaps five was sitting directly behind us with her father - and I didn't see any evidence of fear or unhappiness. Indeed, the tiny child behind us was volubly enthusiastic at the end, telling her father what a wonderful movie it had been and how much she enjoyed it. I think you have to give DreamWorks credit for knowing what people of all ages like and don't like. For all but determined critics, then, I think you will find Kung Fu Panda 2 a worthy sequel and perhaps, in some ways, even better than the first.",1310256000,,3629,4.623255813953488
7089046,5,B00VFVIJFG,Great family movie. I laughed just as much as the first one. I like how they expounded on Po's heritage and how they let us see tigress with feeling. I could watch this movie over and over again. And I'm hoping the end was saying that there would be another one. I am purchasing this when it goes to dvd.,1309651200,,304,4.083333333333333

I think that this movie is much better than the first movie I like how Tigress is so friendly to Po in the second one than she was in the first one. At first I thought that the movie might not be that good because I thought it was weird that the villain was a Peacock! But I found out that it is a very funny,action packed,heartwarming,and a little bit sad too. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that shiffu was my favorite character in the first movie and he's barely in the second movie, but besides that great characters in the movie I love how the furious five are acting more as a family in this movie than the first. I recommend this movie to anybody who wants to sit down and laugh their heads off!
'",1309392000,3,825,4.098765432098766
7089048,3,B00VFVIJFG,"I don't like it as much as the first movie.

There, I said it.
But that's okay, because I do like Kung Fu Panda 2.
This is a sequel that feels relevant. It expands on what I wanted to know about.
Po the panda (Jack Black) now faces the peacock Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), who has invented the cannon to destroy kung fu and conquer China. When the panda and the Furious Five first square off with Shen's wolf bandit underlings, Po starts having flashbacks because of the symbols on the head wolf's armor. And so Po must come to terms with his past if he is to ever find inner peace and defeat Shen. This leads to some truly great moments between Jack Black's Po and James Hong's Mr. Ping, Po's adoptive goose dad.

I'd say that Lord Shen is a better villain than the first film's Tai Lung, because he gets to do much more. There are a number a scenes with him and the soothsayer character (Michelle Yeoh), where her words cause a pressing uncertainty to become clear in his face. Oldman's acting makes Shen's insecurity apparent from beginning to end. I was pretty miffed at what ultimately happened to him though, and there was never really a satisfying final battle between him and Po. He's a memorable character, and I wouldn't mind him appearing in future Panda films (because this one does set itself up for a third).

There's a lot more action than in the original Kung Fu Panda, too much more, and in places where it didn't need to be. It was sometimes totally hectic, sometimes ""wow out loud"" spectacular, sometimes it found dizzying ways to show us the detailed, atmospheric CG world, all the while Po and the Five using their techniques in tandem. There were times where I found the fight to be going on for far too long, the sequence accomplishing very little. They could have used this time to deal with the various characters. Only Tigress of the Furious Five truly has a relationship with Po; Viper, Mantis, Monkey, and Crane are just kind of there. One of the best aspects of Kung Fu Panda was Po and Shifu's (Dustin Hoffman) relationship. Unfortunately, the kung fu master is hardly in this film.

This is a pretty funny movie. It's certainly not as funny as the original, as there's a lot more of the ""cheap sight gags"", and just less laughs in general. Kung Fu Panda managed to find moments that were at once heartwarming yet obviously comedic in a way that made me smile. Here the comedy is usually more straightforward. There are still great moments though, some of Shen's stuff for instance, and Jack Black makes Po as funny and lovable as ever.

So there you have it, I found Kung Fu Panda 2 to be a competent movie and a good sequel that doesn't tread old ground.

7089049,5,B00VFVIJFG,"The animation in this film really blew us (me and my 10-year-old son) away. It was just beautiful to watch.

I was also impressed with the uplifting themes, which are just as relevant for adults as they are for kids.

Theme #1: The love of family
Adoptive parents are just as much your parents--and love you just as much--as birth parents. This is so important for people to remember in a country where divorce has become more the rule than the exception.

Theme #2: Evil is in how a thing is used
Evil does not always lie within a certain item, but rather what that item is used for. This can be seen when the fireworks that are used by the evil peacock in the beginning of the movie are used for celebration at the end.

Theme #3: Growing friendship
In a surprising turn, the friendship between Po (the Panda) and one of his teammates (who was previously not that close of a friend) grows.

Theme #4: The benefits of teamwork
Po has great abilities; but only through teamwork with the rest of The Five is he able to have the opportunity to overcome his greatest challenge.",1308960000,3,1074,4.431472081218274
7089050,4,B00VFVIJFG,"I had some trepidation about this one. The first KFP was so much fun, I was afraid they'd just do more of the same, to the point of too much. Instead, I got better than I bargained for.

Po remains the overfed semi-slacker of KFP1. He has a reputation, by time this movie starts, and a bit of an ego to go with it. And, as in common cases of acute sequel-itis, #2 is like #1, but lots more. The difference is that this flick really goes beyond the founding member of the franchise. You'll love to hate the evil peacock, and his foundry evokes Geidi Prime, the Orcs' smithy, or any other industrial hell you can think of. Then there's Peng, Po's father. Gawd, I love that silly little goose. He's all about fatherhood, the kind that comes to define a man's entire identity (except for a noodle or two), a role I admire immensely when I see it in real life. And, of course, the quality of recent animation goes up faster than Moore's Law can explain. Except for one teeny, weeny thing, this adds up to a very enjoyable kids' flick, the kind you might not need a kid to enjoy. (Parents of skittish littler ones, check first to see if your tot is up for the more intense scenes.)

That one little thing was the flagrant sequel-bait at the end. Grr. A little foreshadowing can be fun. An ambigiuous ending can engage the viewer's imagination. The ending in this one looks almost like a trailer for the next in series. It's almost as if the movie is doing ""product placement"" advertising for itself.

As you watch it, though, try to forget that the ad is coming. Instead, try to enjoy the spirit that contains equal parts Bruce Lee, Mr. Rogers, and Three Stooges. Right down to that big fight scene near the end, there's a lot to enjoy.

When I heard there was going to be a second one, I was a bit leery-- sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals, so why should this one be different? But I was proved wrong, and glad to be!

What makes this sequel so amazing is its almost seemless continuation of the first story, but also with so much new information added. All the original voices (as far as I know) came back to reprise their roles, which always helps. And we get to learn about the inner layers of a few of the characters as well.
