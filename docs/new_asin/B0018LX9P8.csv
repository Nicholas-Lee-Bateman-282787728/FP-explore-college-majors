3417707,3,B0018LX9P8,"I didn't even really care much for the first film, so why the hell would I watch the second one?  Well, either I'm masochistic or I just couldn't resist a title like The Passion of the Crust.
This film isn't so much a sequel(Gingerdead Man was destroyed in the first film, but why should that matter?) as much as it is another adventure of the Gingerdead Man.  I actually liked this movie more than the first one.  In a very vague and flimsy bit of writing, the Gingerdead Man arrives on the grounds of Cheatum Studios, a low budget horror factory in the vein of....Full Moon Pictures!  Most of the short running time is spent showing the goofball antics that occur on the sets of the multiple films being shot on the lot.  Some are kinda funny, most aren't really.  There's also a saboteur on the grounds who has a grudge against the studio because of how lousy it's films have been recently.  The Gingerdead Man goes about killing everyone in his path with such ingenious methods as curling iron sodomy(on a gay character of course).  For the most part he sticks with the tried and true stabbing with butcher knife.
The humor and characters are all rather cliche and stereotypical, but we shouldn't have high expectations for a movie like this.  What I did like is that Full Moon seems to be poking fun at itself with this movie.  The idea of online bloggers petitioning to have Cheatum closed down due to it's lousy films, probably has some truth to it.  At one point, the owner/manager has a monologue about running a low budget independent horror studio, and actually has some interesting things to say.
But without these little pokes at the industry, this movie wouldn't have been any better(or worse depending on how you look at these things) than the first film.  In the Full Moon tradition, this clocks in at just over an hour and pads out about half of that running time with the opening credits!  Oddly enough there's no ""Making Of"" feature on this disc.  Kinda rare for Full Moon.
You know what you're getting into with this film.  You should anyway.",1246752000,3,2062,4.580381471389646
3417708,4,B0018LX9P8,"Ive seen mostly the classic horror films and ive seen horror films that should never have been released. I cant remember the first film, I sold it to buy better films. So why buy a sequel to a crappy movie? Well, I saw a trailer for this film and I knew it would be total crap. The film is short but its worth watching. The Gingerdead Man is funnier this time around and main reason why I enjoyed this film. It's a basic rip off of Troma's Terror Firmer, which is a better film by miles. Even though its no Terror Firmer or Troma film for that matter, it's still enjoyable. Not as bad as people say.",1222905600,,599,4.128205128205129
3417709,1,B0018LX9P8,"This is easily the most boring and lame movie I have ever watched. I like horror movies. I also like campy stupid horror movies like ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" or ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"". There is not a humorous, clever, or scary moment in this film. My teenagers felt the same way about this movie. I can't believe this is even being sold on Amazon. It is horrible. Don't waste your money. I would give this movie 0 stars if I could.",1218240000,,448,4.345238095238095
3417710,2,B0018LX9P8,"If you've seen the first film (and, let's face it, if you're reading this you probably have) then you definitely know what to expect going into this. After six minutes of previous feature recap (standard Full Moon padding procedure) and intentionally crawling credits, we get our first look at Cheatem Studios. It could be that Full Moon was intending to parody themselves here as the young Kelvin Cheatem is accused by of ""having seven films in production at once"" and needing to ""tie up the loose ends"". I thought that all of this had promise until I was subjected to a string of tired stereotypes and lame jokes. All of this would have been tolerable if I'd gotten to see Ginger in action, but most of the time he's active we can only see him in POV shots and ridiculous looking inserts. Still, knowing this before even opening the box didn't stop me from seeing it and I'm sure it won't stop you either...hang on till the end to see what may be the movie's one redeeming sequence, a hilarious crucifixion scene...hence the title. In addition, in case anyone cares, there isn't a ""making of"" feature :-(",1216166400,8,1106,4.619289340101523

3417712,4,B0018LX9P8,"I should preface this review by saying that I attempted to watch, but could not stand the first and third movies in this series. It's not that the premises were too ridiculous, it's that they were just boring. Gingerdead Man part 2 however was a surprisingly enjoyable little movie. The Gingerdead Man gets delivered to the fictional Cheatum Studios movie lot where he proceeds to wreak havoc. I think what makes this movie more entertaining than the other two entries in the series is the antics that go on at the movie studio. The film parodies both Full Moon and its fans. At one point one of the employees from the studio asks ""Why don't we stop making so many bad movies and just put more money into making one GOOD movie?"" It begs the question as to why Full Moon hasn't actually tried this themselves. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror comedies. It's not the best of its genre but with a running time of about an hour and ten minutes you don't have much to lose.",1390694400,,988,4.464088397790055
3417713,2,B0018LX9P8,"What does it look like when a movie studio has given up?  It looks like THE GINGERDEAD MAN 2: Passion of the Crust.

Millard Findlemeyer has, somehow, returned.  Never mind the recap at the beginning of this sequel shows his gingerbread body being eaten, and then the human body he had taken over being burned up, somehow hes back in his gingerbread body and has been delivered from Texas to LA along with a box of donuts to the Cheatum movie studio where production is under way on TINY TERRORS 9: Purgatory of the Petite.

Findlemeyer is desperate to find a new host body, and he uses a prop spell book to figure out how to do that.  First he needs to kill five people, then one more, a virgin, in order to transfer his soul into a new host.  Since hes only just now learning how to perform this spell, it can safely be assumed this isn't the method he used to come back in the first place, so its still unexplained how he went from eaten to burned to back in his gingerbread body, but whatever.

So Findlemeyer sets about offing his victims.  Meanwhile, studio head Kelvin Cheatum, a young man with big dreams and no talent, who is just trying to keep the studio his father created afloat, is giving a tour of the place to Tommy as part of the End of the Rainbow Foundation.  Tommy doesnt have much time left and his dying wish was to see the Cheatum lot.

This is the gist of THE GINGERDEAD MAN 2.  There is little actual plot, the kills are lame--especially the second one, that was just pathetic--and the whole thing is played as a joke.  Well, that makes sense, since this is billed a horror comedy.  The problem is, its neither scary nor funny.  I said it was played as a joke, I never said it was a good joke.

The whole Cheatum Studios thing is nothing more than a play on the Full Moon Entertainment roster of movies, playing up how low their budgets are and how ill-received their movies are by critics.  The Cheatum aspect of the plot is sort of a middle finger from Full Moon to all the people who say they make bad movies.  The thing is, the DO make bad movies.  But we still watch them because, for the most part, they seem--or SEEMED--to take what they did seriously.  That was part of the fun, the punch line to the joke, because the movies were bad, but they had passion behind them.  This one, however, its just sad.

Self-referential stories are fun, thats why SCREAM was so popular, and being in on the joke is cool, too.  But the in-joke has to have something of substance behind it.  The gingerdead man masturbating while an up-and-comer nails a desperate has-been before killing them both is not funny.  Its just a show of how far the once-decent Full Moon has fallen if THIS passes for entertainment.

The cast is decent, I suppose, all things considered.  Writer Muffy Bolding and director Silvia St. Croix have opted for the ridiculous when it comes to humor, and theres not even an attempt at horror, so the whole movie plays like bad slapstick, and the cast are just trying to get through the shoot, grab a sandwich from the craft services table, and get back to their apartments so they can cry themselves to sleep.  The main star, K-Von (Kelvin Cheatum) went on to play various roles in MTVs Disaster Date while Tommy (Joseph Porter) was Ensign Filbert in MEGA PIRANHA.  Kelsey Sanders, who played Heather from the End of the Rainbow Foundation and Tommys chaperone, went on to play Ann Margaret Type on an episode of Mad Men and Redhead on Nashville.

These aren't big names, but they gave it their all and it wasn't terrible.  In fact, I suspect with a better script and a director who wanted to make a horror movie, they might have done pretty well indeed.

Too bad they were hobbled from the beginning by a production company that just didn't care.  The very fact there is a movie called THE GINGERDEAD MAN 2: Passion of the Crust is already a sure sign the end is near, but man, at least TRY to make it not suck.  They owed their fans at least that much.",1385424000,,3991,4.393732970027248
3417714,2,B0018LX9P8,"Gingerdead Man 2 starts off with a WTF explantion of how anyone could have dreamed up a movie so ridiculous that it makes the Chucky franchise seem semi-plausible and coherent, and then introduces us to the fact that we are about to watch a sequel entitled Passion of the Crust.  Aaaand, action!

Film opening, faux satanic ritual where the supposedly nubile, young, sacrificial virgin looks like the fat one from Wilson Phillips - if filming took place in 2025 - and the cult leader is an obvious Ming the Merciless ripoff who worships Satan's demigods, including one named ""Haunted Dildo.""  Luckily, this is just a movie within a movie, where the fake cast members are worse than the actual cast members.  Enter the screaming epitome of how low budget this film is, the supposed sex object is a cross between the hooker Air Force Amy from HBO's Cathouse series and a plastic surgeon's career nadir.  The cast devolves into a badly filmed SNL skit/fight, and a high school audio visual project.  Next is a guy who's such a bad actor, and such a poor attempt at a Johnny Knoxville ripoff, that I hear the Academy is looking up his mother's address and whether or not the plot to Terminator is feasible.  When a sequel visibly misses the acting prowess of Gary Busey, you know there are problems.

Luckily, however, this movie is more about the crude jokes, bad puns, and enough cheese to put Kraft out of business.  Gingerbread Man is funny in the same way that Chucky and Ted are funny; it's a doll dropping F-bombs, masturbating, and making poop jokes.  He's wreaking havoc at Cheatum Studios, killing horrible actors - including curling-iron sodomy - while faux Johnny Knoxville gets a tour of the studio during the filming of Tiny Terrors 9...for some reason.

It's a horrible movie, but there is a decent chance you knew what you were getting into when you started watching it.  As long as there a viewer laughs three or four times during the filming, and can hopefully ignore the majority of the poor attempts at acting, then the effort is worthwhile.  Atrocious, definitely not worth buying, or even renting for that matter, but worthwhile for a single viewing.  Especially if you have an hour and a half to completely waste.",1372377600,,2232,4.7338501291989665
3417715,4,B0018LX9P8,"Full Moon has made a lot of trashy sequels in their day, but with GINGERDEAD MAN 2... They totally redeem themselves! The demented cookie sneaks his way on to the backlot of Cheatum Studios, where Kelvin Cheatum is struggling to save his father's failing company with his own string of low-budget schlockbusters like SPACE SPANKERS 2015 and the long-running TINY TERRORS series. If the malfunctioning monsters and complaining crew members weren't already enough, now Kelvin has dead bodies to deal with if he ever hopes to finish shooting! William Butler's clever script is more telling about Full Moon as a company than anything else. GINGERDEAD MAN 2 is a hilarious spoof on independent filmmaking that surpasses the similarly-themed BRUTAL MASSACRE and HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD in producing consistent laughs with its biting cynicism. It also features several brilliant self-parodying appearances by Full Moon favorites David DeCoteau, John Carl Buechler, Greg Nicotero, and others as they gently poke fun at their own careers in B-Movie Horror. The Gingerdead man, himself, is given funnier lines and much more creative ways of disposing of his second batch of victims amidst the heavily-dressed sets. GINGERDEAD MAN 2 is, by far, one of Full Moons biggest and best productions in years, and a complete reversal from the previous film.

3417716,4,B0018LX9P8,"I watched Gingerdead Man 2 and loved every minute of it.  The movie set and director were obviously meant to spoof Charles Band and Full Moon, which I thought was hilarious.  Plus, its fun to watch the Gingerdead Man curse and say nasty things right before he kills people.  It's not exactly the Kings Speech, but it isn't meant to be and that wasn't what I wanted.  If you are in the mood for silly, goofy low budget ridiculousness, Gingerdead Man 2 delivers the goods.",1298332800,4,470,4.4941176470588236
3417717,4,B0018LX9P8,"I wasn't a big fan of Gingerdead Man, but Gingerdead Man 2 is a definite step up. It's a lot of fun, to be honest. However, you have to be a big fan of b-movies, because this flick is littered with b-movie in-jokes that might fly over the head of people who aren't fans of such movies. There are lots of fun cameos, from the likes of David Decoteau, Greg Nicotero, Frank Nicotero, and John Carl Buechler. But the actor that really put a smile to my face was Michelle Bauer. I'm a fan of hers, having seen her in Sorority Babes In The Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama, Nightmare Sisters, and Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, among others. She has aged since she was in those movies, but she is still a very entertaining performer. Here, she plays a milf with a botched boob job and she is absolutely hilarious. Also, what's good about Gingerdead Man 2 is that it's pretty gory. The first one disappointed me in the gore department, but this one sure didn't. If I had to describe Gingerdead Man 2, I would say it's Child's Play meets Troma. And that's a good thing, in my book. See it, if you like cheesy and campy b-movies.",1297209600,,1106,4.4

Story, acting and my favorite....the SPECIAL EFFECTS!!! There are some parts I can accually see a hand moving Mr. Ginger around on his  waste up close ups!! And still triing to figure how he shot the pistol (esspecially when its under his armpit and both his arms are stiffies above him!!?). I just can't say enough!!!!

3417719,3,B0018LX9P8,"I saw the first Gingerdead Man, and was expecting a bad movie in a good cheesy way, like classic Full Moon stuff. Instead, it was just a straight up bad movie, much to my dismay. Being the geek I am, I still decided to check out the second one, and am glad I did. This time, I got what I was expecting, a bad movie that is fun and cheesy. That's not to say it was entertaining all the way through, but there's enough cheesy fun for me to give it a thumbs up.

Even if you didn't like the first one, give this one a shot.",1259452800,4,520,3.8598130841121496
3417720,3,B0018LX9P8,"I highly doubt anyone would be watching this unless you saw the first Gingerdead Man and spent the whole time astonished by what you saw. Astonished not being in that good way, but more by the fact that you can't believe what you were watching. In the first Gingerdead man we were introduced to the b worlds' first serial killer bakery item whose spirit was made up of sugar, cinnamon, and a heavy dose of 1 insane Gary Busey. It was simply hilarious and bizarre all mixed into one giant mess of a movie, but I really enjoyed it for what it was. Sometime last July I heard Full Moon had released a 2nd installment of the Gingerdead man which sent me on a video store quest to only come up empty handed. I wasn't willing to buy it for 30 some odd dollars since I knew it would most likely be a one time viewing which put it on the back burner for a while. Finally a year later I got my hands on a copy and wasn't surprised by what I saw.

This time around our pint sized killer friend the Gingerdead man has been delivered into a box baked goods to Cheatum Studios. Despite the fact that he was destroyed in the first one there is no explanation to how he's back, but hey it's Full Moon. They actually did a great job in this film by making fun of their own pictures at every turn. It's pretty much and hour+ spoofing their countless sequels, low budgets, poor direction, and awful acting they've provided over the years. The main character Kelvin Cheatum, whose a complete spoof on Charles Band, is pulling out all the stops to keep his studio running as it's on the downward spiral.

Kelvin is giving a dying boy a tour of the studio while the Gingerdead man is doing some major killing behind the scenes. As the the killings continue Kelvin works on trying to pull the disgruntled actors together to try and finish Tiny Terrors 9 before they lose everything. Then Kelvin and his tourers walk in on the Gingerdead man while chainsawing one of the stagehands causing studio wide panic. Eventually it turns out the dying kid is in disguise and really a crazed fan who want to bring the studio down. However the Gingerdead man saves the day to some extent only to be killed by the puppets from Tiny Terrors 9.

I really enjoyed the Gingerdead man 2 and think it may have a slight edge on the first one. Now my enjoyment comes from the standpoint of it being a Full Moon film and not a legitimate big budget flick. It'd really be foolish to pick this one up and expect to get anything really good. It's obviously nowhere near scary but did provide me with a lot of laughs and enjoyment. It's certainly not worth the purchase but is really fun for a one time watch. You have to admire the fact that they were big enough to take some jabs at their own studio. They're aware of the style of film they put out and seem happy with the results. It's an acquired taste for sure. It left me looking forward to Gingerdead Man 3: Saturday Night Clever which will be coming down the road at some point, no release date yet.",1247443200,7,3009,4.312720848056537
