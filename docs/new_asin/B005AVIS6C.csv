4642644,5,B005AVIS6C,"The Lamp is a wonderful, wholesome and inspiring family film.  It shows that if we have faith, even in the face of adversity, God can heal our hearts and allow us to grow.  While there is sadness and grief, there is also hope and faith.  I highly recommend this movie.  Watch and be prepared to grieve, hope and rejoice with the characers along their journey.  Just Believe!",1310515200,35,374,4.522388059701493

4642647,4,B005AVIS6C,I had read the book and wanted to see the movie. When I did it was one I wanted to have. Even though it is basically a Christian movie it really doesn't come across like one. The people make the plan and work on it.,1438387200,,215,3.8

4642652,5,B005AVIS6C,"Awesome. A most positive way to look at life and the obstacles we face. Reminded me of the Secret and that our dreams can and do come true, if we just believe. I've interviewed Louis Gossett Jr. and this role fit him perfectly.",1426464000,,227,4.3023255813953485
4642653,4,B005AVIS6C,"A heart-warming movie which tells us that we already have the things that we would try to wish for and that the things we think we would wish for (like lots of money) really doesn't solve a lot in the end.  Louis Gossett Jr. plays the wise old angel/sage which he does very well.  The movie is sweet and touching.  I liked it and would watch it again.  But, I am not sitting here wishing I had Aladan's lamp because the movie shows that if we appreciate and apply the things we already have, we don't need 3 wishes to make life right.",1425081600,,534,4.155339805825243
4642654,5,B005AVIS6C,"Great family movie. Touches on the adoption/ fostering subject, could be a good intro for some families. We really enjoy this movie.",1420502400,,132,5.045454545454546

4642665,3,B005AVIS6C,"Good family movie, not for the very young though as our 3 year old couldn't stay interested. The movie was formulaic and slow with so-so acting. The story was nice and certainly fit for the whole family.",1391731200,,203,4.513513513513513
4642666,5,B005AVIS6C,"I highly recommend this movie to all. I first saw it on BYUTV and really liked it and decided It was a
movie worth watching again. I watched it with a friend and he like it as well. Great message in the movie.",1389052800,,209,3.883720930232558

4642668,2,B005AVIS6C,"It's probable that people with stronger stomachs for people showing extreme anger than I do, would like this movie a lot more than I did.  If you have a past that includes trauma from emotional abuse of the ""yelling and throwing things"" variety, I think you might not enjoy it.  It definitely does have a ""very special movie"" kind of feel to it, but I was so distracted by hoping the wife would get herself a restraining order and some decent counseling that I can't really articulate exactly how.  The visuals are pretty good, and the always-friendly/always-inspirational actors are just as friendly and inspirational as always. Just a lot more uncomfortable for me than I'm willing to endure.",1385856000,,694,4.864406779661017
4642669,5,B005AVIS6C,OUTSTANDING BOOK ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN  I have shared this book many times and will continue to share it with others,1383436800,,133,4.541666666666667
4642670,3,B005AVIS6C,"I bought this from a Christian source and expected a Christian movie. There was nothing in this movie that I could see that would indicate it was Christian. It could have been from any faith including Muslim, especially since it is similar to the Arabian Nights stories with the Aladdin's lamp and the three wishes, and someone who magically appears. It could have been Buddhist. It was actually more New Age sort of thinking of whatever works for you is good, only believe. Doesn't matter what you believe in, Or the power of positive thinking groups, whoever teaches that. Nice things, moral but it is not Christian and the movie doesn't mention anything about God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Bible, people from the Bible. Reminds me of Macy's Christmas ads: ""Believe....""  Believe in what?  Is it an uplifting movie? It tries, though the first third is sad. And it is family friendly. People who are nominal Christians might be able to project Christianity into it. But I'm taking it back to the Christian book store where I bought it and asking for my money back. Should have read Amazon reviews first.",1378512000,3,1108,4.765625
4642671,3,B005AVIS6C,"I was going to give it a 2 star that would reflect that I didn't like it.  Most of the acting was poor, the story was weak, but the message was positive.  In the end it was a family type movie, you could watch it with your 9+ kid and reflect on the good in your life.",1377993600,,267,3.6666666666666665
4642672,4,B005AVIS6C,"this was a nice film to watch, has a great message and a nice ending.  illustrates the importance of 'believing'.",1376956800,,113,4.65
4642673,4,B005AVIS6C,"This movie appealed to our family with the ultimate message, although the theme resembling a lamp and genie was kind of lame. The acting was good, the characters believable, and their situation heart-rending. It was what they learned along the way that leaves a flavor of inspiration with us, and made it into the kind of movie we'd watch more than once.",1376611200,,354,4.725806451612903
4642674,5,B005AVIS6C,Good family film with uplifting and edifying lessons. Quality production with good acting and story line. A film that is good for all audiences.,1376179200,,144,5.041666666666667
4642675,5,B005AVIS6C,"I get rather tired and bored with reviewers that claim to be a Minister, Reverend, Rabbi, and ECT: What difference does it make weather anyone mentions God or Christ, but go off on a tangent that this is not a Christian film............. I say it is, it had all the subtleties and we need more of this type of films.........Good Job Give us more. If this helps with bringing one to God then WHY NOT............",1375660800,,410,4.48

4642677,5,B005AVIS6C,I liked the movie bcuz it had such believable characters. They were going thru a hard time in their marriage & this lamp was an answer to prayer.  The ending is so surprising as well.,1374105600,,183,4.228571428571429
4642678,4,B005AVIS6C,I liked the way it moved through the story and how a death in the family was handled.  Deals with serious issues but handled in a very positive way and with a happy ending.,1373760000,,172,4.0588235294117645
4642679,5,B005AVIS6C,"""Just Believe"", what an appropriate theme that makes us do our personal best and appreciate all that life offers you!  I loved this movie and was inspired by the fact of turning a tragedy to a blessing.",1373414400,,202,4.45945945945946

4642681,5,B005AVIS6C,"I enjoyed the movie. It was refreshing, fun, shed a few tears and wonderful ending. I enjoy movies that have a happy ending, no blood and gore. Just a simple happy movie.",1372118400,,170,4.34375
4642682,3,B005AVIS6C,"I previewed this movie for my 5 and 7 year olds and it was too serious for my taste. The movie starts out with a couple whose child passed away 2 years earlier and the father's difficulty in getting through this tragic event. I stopped watching when the magic lamp came into the story (which was about 30 minutes into the movie). But having a G rating, I thought it would be geared more toward younger children. The movie itself isn't bad, but just not what I was looking for for my children.",1371427200,,492,4.301075268817204
4642683,5,B005AVIS6C,This is a wonderful family movie with a great message. Such an inspirational story that shows the true meaning of love & just how powerful love can be.,1369440000,,151,4.428571428571429
4642684,5,B005AVIS6C,This movie has gotten me in trouble lol its sooo good  I told my friends about it and one called me and cursed me .... Let me explain.... She doesnt like sad movies but... This movie kept me on breaking edge of all emotions so i forgot to mention that  It is sad and then happy best tear jerker ever,1368748800,,299,3.966666666666667
4642685,4,B005AVIS6C,There were some sad parts but like Hallmark movies the ending was great. The start is a little slow and I didn't like the main actor guy as much but the movie gets better.,1368576000,,171,4.0588235294117645
4642686,5,B005AVIS6C,The Lamp was a hidden gem and Ice Cube does an awesome job. You will not be disappointed.  Glad Igave it a try.,1368144000,,111,3.8260869565217392

4642689,5,B005AVIS6C,This movie is heart warming and deep in relationship building.  Good characters and with a tweet to the surprise ending.,1365984000,,120,5.0
4642690,5,B005AVIS6C,This movie shows how different we grieve with the lost of a family member.  The Lamp shows how love of others helps you through your grieving process.  Great movie.,1365897600,,164,4.620689655172414
4642691,5,B005AVIS6C,i choose this rating because it was such a good story and really enjoyed the touch of fantasy it added. Was nice to be able to watch a movie with my family and not have to censor things for the young ones yet it held my attention and interest also.,1365811200,,248,3.98
4642692,4,B005AVIS6C,"Good portrayal of God working through the angels around us in our circumstances! Got to believe!, in yourself and others.",1365811200,,121,5.1
4642693,5,B005AVIS6C,This movie is based on Letting go of the Anger and finding a Blessings!! I loved this movie!!! You will love it...,1365724800,,114,4.2272727272727275
4642694,5,B005AVIS6C,The Lamp was a great movie that I would think would be good for the family. It teaches you so much and makes you think what has happened and what ended up happening. Heartfelt. My daughter and I really enjoyed it and we plan to watch it again. Watch it you may get something out of it if you have a opened mind.,1364256000,,311,3.9523809523809526
4642695,5,B005AVIS6C,A very good life story. I have recommended this movie to many folks and loaned my copy out to others. All enjoyed it,1363824000,,116,4.086956521739131
4642696,5,B005AVIS6C,"Starts out slow, and believe me you'll begin to hope the bereaved father drops dead.

I know that my review wasn't as articulate or ""pretty"" as the others that rated this a FIVE STAR
movie, but it was certainly better than the ""Preacher"" and the other ""dude"" that gave this won-
derful work-of-love film a single, and a 2-star rating.
I say we need more of THESE films,

4642698,4,B005AVIS6C,"I just viewed ""The Lamp"" for the first time. It starts off slowly and at first seems a downer because it sets the stage after a child's untimely death. From there, it gets mysteriously hopeful when an antique lamp is received as a gift.  To tell more would give away the most interesting and heartwarming plot, full of surprises, warm fuzzies. Good story line. You may anticipate how it will end, but it's such a joy getting there. There is a subtle Christian message, but nothing ""preachy"" and the whole movie is full of hope. Don't miss it!",1359244800,,542,4.530612244897959

4642700,4,B005AVIS6C,"My wife and I watched this movie after reading a couple comments. But I was misled (by some of the comments) into thinking this is a Christian movie. Although to be fair I have to emphasize that the movie description never claims that ""The Lamp"" is a Christian movie. Therefore I am giving it 4 stars, only to be fair. You can find out about the story by reading the description of the movie.",1356739200,,392,4.3108108108108105

4642705,5,B005AVIS6C,"This movie starts off rather slow, but then picks up speed as the story line quickens.  Has some fantasy but also makes us think of the things that can happen if we only believe.  Very family friendly, the whole family will enjoy,.",1347840000,,231,4.476190476190476

It's so wonderful to watch a movie with absolutely no problems areas to screen out or explain. I also love the values that are emphasized and the demonstration of how to solve very deep personal problems arising from tragedy. If we all behaved as selflessly as these actors portrayed this world would be so much better and people would find the joy of helping others.",1347408000,,489,4.6976744186046515
4642707,5,B005AVIS6C,"""The Lamp"" is a sleeper. A very simple movie. No great special effects, just life.

Grief is expressed through a father who felt responsible for losing his only son. He then lost all love for himself and those around him. He felt it impossible to overcome. He was truly lost!

The meaningful part of this well done, well casted movie, was that he really never needed the ""Lamp,"" just an opportunity to see the beauty of life through children.

Again, it is a simple movie, but one with a great message. God knows we need more movies like this in these most difficult, material times. Help is coming... Just Believe!

Highly recommended.

4642708,2,B005AVIS6C,"I bought this movie because of the reviews on here that were so overwhelmingly positive. Some of the other reviews on here mention God and give off the idea that this is a Christian film but they never once mention God, so when they say ""Just Believe"" you're left to wonder are they referring to believing in God, one's self, or something else entirely.  I guess it's just me but this movie leaves a lot to be desired. I loved the story line behind the movie but it leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions. The story line needs a lot more development. This really could have been a much better film with more character development. You kinda feel like it starts in the middle and abruptly ends. It was a clean movie and we need more of those but there are much better Christian family friendly movies out there for the price.",1329609600,21,831,4.396103896103896

It's a story about overcoming tragedy and loss in a couple's life, and how they found new hope and re-discovered the love they had buried beneath their pain from losing a son. Life does go on, as you will see in this wonderful ""feel good"" movie you can watch over and over again.  It will truly touch your heart and soul very deeply, as you fall in love with the wonderful characters portrayed in this story.  The precious Cameron ten Napel is such a talented actress and you will love her energy and joy she brings to the couple in the story.  Keep an eye out for more fabulous films to come from director Tracy Trost.

4642711,5,B005AVIS6C,"I love this movie for these reasons:
1- there is a good lesson  that we as human from all ages need to learn: when adversity strike , learn how to move on.
2- the plot is simple but good and practical for all ages.
3- the children in the movie are so good in acting and the main child is very cute.
4- Clean , there are no embarrassing moments. I am planing to watch it again with the children this week-end. I think children can learn from this movie how to move on as well.
5- It is eye opener about people's pain and how they could get over the pain and make the best of life.

With all of the movies these days being dark, or filthy language, sex, etc., it is great to see a movie that has FAMILY attitudes.  I spend too much time cringing in my frontroom from the things I see on TV.  Last year we decided to start a membership with a rental service and to buy the movies we fall in love with.  This is one that we felt was a ""KEEPER"".  Today I am buying it so that we can watch it many times more.  You won't be sorry if you buy this one.",1326412800,,575,3.871794871794872

4642715,5,B005AVIS6C,"I will recommend this movie to everyone.  It is so refreshing to have a clean, wholesome, movie that entertains and sends a message at the same time.  I am so happy that Trost Moving Pictures are producing such films.  This story is a definite tear-jerker but there are some light moments that make you laugh as well.  We will be watching this again and look forward to future releases.",1325721600,,386,4.550724637681159

4642719,5,B005AVIS6C,"After a Christmas Snow I wondered how Tracy Trost could top that great film.  While ""The Lamp"" doesn't quite do that, it is on the same high level.  It is a very moving story and I will be purchasing copies for Christmas presents.",1320192000,,230,4.325581395348837
4642720,5,B005AVIS6C,"As part of the Trost Moving Pictures Ambassador program, I have reviewed their movies, books and soundtracks. My first impression of The Lamp was ""TMP movies keep getting better and better"".

Stanley watched his son Eddy die and has grieved for the past two years. He is unable to concentrate on his career, gets frequent calls about his debt and he spends time watching a little league softball team. It has put such a strain on his marriage with Lisa that he announces that it is over and he plans on leaving.

Next door is Miss Esther's home with foster children. One is Jocelyn (aka Josh) who plays on the softball team, has anger issues, and acts as a big sister for a shy girl named Rachel.

Lisa acquires an old oil lamp from Miss Esther next door. When she polishes the side and reads the inscription, a more-a-messenger-than-a-genie appears. He asks Lisa and Stanley what they want most of all. He gives them thirty days to think about this. As they begin to focus on what they want, life improves for them. They start a friendship with Josh and Rachel when Stanley takes over as the coach of the team. Stanley returns to work, getting bonuses to help with the bills. Their marriage starts to rebuild. Of course, there are some bumps along the road to recovery, including a major one at the end.

Sam from A Christmas Snow also returns. In a timeline comparison, this movie takes place the summer before A Christmas Snow occurs.

In my opinion, this is the movie that Trost Moving Pictures has waited a long time for. If you have seen The Ultimate Gift, also by Jim Stovall, this movie equals in greatness. It is a good as a family film as A Christmas Snow, yet focused on religious principals rather than on only one religion.",1319500800,9,1736,4.533546325878595
4642721,5,B005AVIS6C,"""The Lamp"" is a fantastic movie with a charming story and wonderful acting.

4642724,5,B005AVIS6C,"My 78 year old dad called me (crying) after having watched The Lamp. This is one of the hardest men I have ever known in my life. And the fact that I have never known him to watch a movie that didn't have an accessive amount of violence and cussing. He said, ""This is a real good movie. This is a tear jerker. I'm gonna watch it again before I go to bed"".

I watched the Lamp last week and must say, it is a tear jerker. It is also affirmation to the phase ""Just Believe"".

Outstanding movie for all ages. Which also makes it a great gift.",1314662400,17,539,3.9814814814814814
