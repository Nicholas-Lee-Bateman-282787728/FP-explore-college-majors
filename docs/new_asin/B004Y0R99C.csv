8447818,5,B004Y0R99C,"Greetings;

Sometimes it can be so difficult to get your hands on these foreign imports. Had seen this on eBay a number of years back from a seller in China, seriously considered buying it but just didn't have the funds at the time. Picked it up on here, was pretty satisfied with the movie overall. Some imorts just don't work well, tend to frag out halfway through the movie and you can never finish it. Will end up buying several of the Mr. Vampire movies over again as a result. But in either case...

Bought this movie largely because of Lam Ching-Ying being it is. His movies are usually pretty good. Funny, to say, comedy while still being a horror movie. Decent effects for the time and the martial arts arn't bad either. Does a sort of...Well it kind of reminded me of drunken boxing, only it was a sword routine. Pretty cool. Once again, Lam played the role of a taoist priest, with the exception that he has lost his yellow priest robes and replaced them with fur hides that you might expect to see more on a Mongol. I think he had been set up more in Tibet, based on some of the customs he mentions. The host lets his guest sleep with his wife, for example.

Was a lot like the Mr. Vampire series, except in this case, just wasn't any vampires. The principle villian was actually the evil spirit of a Red Jacket-an insect if you arn't familiar, sort of like a hornet. If you recall, in Mr. Vampire, the first movie, there is a scene where the city police are running around the mountain side, looking for the vampire, for he would have been weakened during the day and they wanted to finish him off. Came across a cave and just as they were about to explore it, a large ape-like creature comes screaming at them and you see them run back out of the cave in wide-shot, see the creature come out too, sort of do the chest beating thing. Well, you get to see a bit more of that in here. Comes out of a cave, eventually shows up at a camp along the road, in a tent full of dead people-is dead too-killed by red jacket spirit.

This next section will pretty much give away the plot of the movie altogether, so don't read it if you don't want me to completly ruin it:

Lam had found a little girl 18 years ago along the road and adopted her, back wherever it was he was training, possibly Tibet. He raised her and now she is all grown up. He and she are on the road heading back to mainland China I believe, to where he had been trained by his now long dead master so that he can pray at his alter. Lam had a fellow student, I don't remember his name, though I believe it was Lan. Lan Dahk? Either way, Lan took over the training hall of his dead master. The master had a daughter and proposed to his students that he wanted one of them to marry her and take over the Hall. The master said that she was already 3 months pregnant and when each student asked who the father was-since there were only two men in her life-either student that is, the master said that if they truely loved her, it wouldn't matter. Lam wanted time to think it over-he knew he himself was a virgin and could not be the father. So he left the hall to train elsewhere out of shame though I imagine it was more that he beleived that the other student would have to be the father and therefore the girl and Lan would have had a real relationship he was unaware of-she always seemed to like Lam more. Lan is a bit of a womanizer, built more like the Buddha, if you catch my meaning. Not much to look at.
Anyway, Lan has a son that turns out, really is his son. The son had been visited by foreigners and taught some science. Is able to build a generator for example, thinks that electricity can cure arthritis-tries to use it on his great uncle-think he was just the dead master's assistant though might have really been his brother too, just sort of figured it was more an honors thing. The foreigners had also given him an English name-Ringo, though no one ever seems to call him that. He ends up stealing a large Wok from a nearby temple to essentially build a kind of good luck device. It looks like a satellite, but he says it was supposed to attract good luck. Around that time, a priest, whom you see in other Mr. Vampire movies, is doing some sort of a cleansing ritural on a number of spirits trapped in jars. There are just some days that it is better to purify spirits. Well Ringo's luck magnet thing ends up drawing one of the pots to him, I think. The spirit is relesed from the jar and gets struck by lightning and tossed into a nearby well. Somehow the spirits is split in half and is incomplete. One part lingers around, the other goes into some part of the underworld that you never ever see, but his father goes into the well to try to retrieve it. The manage to put her back together again and even though it was always the way of the temple to be rid of spirits like her immediatly-ghosts bring the living nothing but bad luck, they decide to keep her around until the day comes that they can purify her, several months, I gather.
Lam and his daughter are going to the temple, along the way, they come across the ape-like creature. Around the same time, they had been trying to hunt a rabbit to eat when the rabbit falls into a hole that the Red Jacket spirit is nesting in. Lam's daughter takes a stick and shoves it into the hole to try to get the rabbit, which Red Jacket apparently has just eaten. The daughter puts out Red Jackets-its right eye. It becomes even more vengeful and spends the rest of its time free trying to kill the daughter. Lam catches it and plans to dispose of it later at the temple-needs a special wood to burn with it to destroy it he said.
Lam arrives at the Hall, things are tense between Lam and Lan as either one is not sure of the parentage of Ringo, you have to admit, looks like he could be Lam's son. Lan and Ringo don't get along very well. Pretty different. Lan asks the uncle if he was ringo's father or not. Though you have to understand that what was actually asked played more to the tune of 'did he really come from me.' Which the uncle says no. He reveals towards the end that as Lan is a man, he bare a child and that Ringo obviously came from the mother and that the dead master had been testing his students to see which of them would take better care of her. Lan finally accepts that Ringo is his and that he really doesn't need to fear Lam trying to replace him.
Lam discovers the good ghost that they are harboring and tries to destroy it on the spot, the others defend the ghost who apparently is a good cook and believe would make Ringo a good wife-might be a way to bring her back from what was mentioned at the table, but still. Lan finally takes the container with Red Jacket spirit in it and says that if he can't keep the good ghost, then why does Lam keep that spirit, ends up dropping the bamboo shoot container and opens it, releases the vengeful spirit. Results in a big fight which ends with them defeating the spirit. Saving and finally purifying the good ghost. The spiritual trinity is then either the fact that the good ghost was breaking into three parts and needed to get put back together again or the fact that it took the combined powers of Lam, Lan and Lan's wife to put the good ghost back together again. But it does end on a positive note at least.

And there you have it. More or less, my synopsis. Hope you enjoyed it, and the movie. Only thing left to ad is that the movie is dubbed in Cantonese, Mandarin. Subtitled in Traditional, simplified Chinese and English. It is also a Regionless disk, I beleive. At least mine was and was produced-put on dvd in my case, by a Winson Entertainment Distribution Ltd. Played just fine.

Thank you and take care...",1350345600,,7728,4.253061224489796
