7816217,5,6301864239,I saw this move many years ago and fell in love with the charaters.  I'm am hoping one day they release this movie on DVD.  This was not an Oscar Perfomance but it really shows true friendship and coping with Cancer.,1259366400,4,216,4.2439024390243905
7816218,5,6301864239,"I FIRST SAW SILENCE LIKE GLASS IN 1991,I SAW IT ON BRITISH TV AND DID NOT REALIZE AT THE TIME WHAT A GREAT FILM IT WAS.I THEN TRIED IN VAIN TO TRY AND FIND THE FILM IN BRITAIN BUT WAS NEVER ABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE I RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS NEVER MADE AVAILABLE TO THE UK.
 I HAVE RECENTLY BOUGHT THE FILM FROM THE US AND HAVE ALSO PURCHASED A VIDEO RECORDER THAT ALSO PLAYS NTSC,WE HAVE PAL/SECAM FORMAT IN UK.IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE THE FILM AGAIN AFTER 11 YEARS,GOD,TIME GOES FAST.
 I WAS A BIG FAN OF JAMI GERTZ WHEN I FIRST SAW THE LOST BOYS,BUT AFTER SEEING HER PERFORMANCE HERE IT REALLY MADE ME SEE WHAT A GREAT ACTRESS SHE IS.SHE PLAYS A BALLERINA CALLED EVA WHO DEVELOPS CANCER AND IS ADMITTED TO A CANCER HOSPITAL AND BEFRIENDS CLAUDIA,PLAYED WONDERFULLY BY MARTHA PLIMPTON,THE TWO BECOME BESTEST FRIENDS AND HAVE A SPECIAL BOND THAT CARRIES THE FILM WELL.
 SEEING THE FILM FOR A SECOND TIME WAS STILL THOUGHT PROVOKING AND SHOULD MAKE US ALL SEE JUST HOW SPECIAL AND FRAGILE OUR TIME HERE TRULY IS,THE FILM IS A TRUE STORY AND PERSONALLY,I THINK MOST OF THE BEST ONES ARE.
 IN MY OPINION,SILENCE LIKE GLASS SITS WELL WITH OTHER GREAT FILMS SUCH AS;BEACHES,FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AND STEEL MAGNOLIA'S.
 SILENCE LIKE GLASS IS A FILM THAT I WAITED A LONG TIME TO GET BUT IT WAS DEFINETLEY WORTH THE WAIT.
