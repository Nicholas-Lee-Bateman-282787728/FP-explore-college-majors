345498,1,630141019X,The 1982 movie Skin Deep with Nicole Kidman having top billing is not the Blake Edwards/John Ritter film.  The 1982 movie is a complete waste of time. I only laughed because it was so painfully horrible...below a B-movie.  I just watched a bad early 80's Australian soap opera parading as a movie.,1506556800,9,297,4.6923076923076925
345499,5,630141019X,"It's a great movie, but there's no reason whatsoever to have Nicole Kidman's name or face on the cover. Extremely misleading, obviously just to make a sale. He role was so small, I don't even know why she was mentioned. In the tiny blip she had, however, her acting was very good. You'll probably enjoy the movie, but don't buy it for Nicole Kidman, or you'll be extremely disappointed. She doesn't even play a supporting role. The total camera time with Nicole Kidman was maybe 3-4 minutes.",1505779200,,491,4.655172413793103

345670,5,630141019X,"A fun comedy starring the late John Ritter and Alyson Reed in the title roles.  Ritter is a successful writer going through a mid-life crisis and suffering from writer's block looking for salvation in the arms of beautiful women and alcohol.  His betrayed wife played by Reed kicks him out of the house then files for divorce, but like a bad penny he keeps turning up in her life even stopping her wedding.  Hilarious.  Lovely Reed has been under-rated as an actress.  She is completely believable as a woman veering between anger, hurt, and residual feelings of love for her ex.  A bevy of beautiful recognizable women have bit parts as women who land in bed with Ritter.  Those gorgeous gals include Brenda Strong of Dallas, Julianne Phillips of Sisters fame, and several unnamed ladies including the model who punches out Ritter.  Nina Foch is hysterical as the grande dame mother-in-law who absolutely hates him.  Her sarcastic one-liners are funny.  I don't wish to give the plot away, but rent this for a laugh-in at home.",1391558400,,1028,4.7897727272727275

The movie is definitely a comedy, the serious and sometimes somber subjects are balanced perfectly with light-hearted moments played very well by Ritter and the cast.  Although he was great, excellent, on the TV show, this film reveals some aspects of Ritter's acting that were unexplored on the show.  The writing is quite good and there is much witty, intelligent and sarcastic back and forth between the personalities.  There are also many charming scenes, including the beautiful piano segments, the ""costume party"" and the most original scene in the movie: a fight between Ritter and a male rival, hilarious!",1391385600,,774,5.119047619047619

I miss him dearly).  Blake Edwards may be best known for the Pink Panther films, but I believe his very best work was in his 'Dramedies', like Skin Deep.

345702,5,630141019X,"I am not the world's most knowledgable of film buffs. I own a couple hundred DVD's but most of those are lesser known films. I am particularly disinterested in most of the popular action or shock humor type of films that dominate the movie landscape of today.

I remember the previews of this movie as discussed in newspapers and morning news shows due to the then shocking ""glows in the dark"" scene and that the beloved John Ritter was starring in the lead role.

Several years later did I come across this movie and was immediately hooked.

The movie is a wonderfully insightful story of a writer whose insecurities overcome his previously displayed writing prowess. The tragedy of writers block is overcompensated by alcohol and sex, which nearly destroys the very endearing character as played brilliantly by John Ritter. The movie is heart-warming yet hillarious. The twists and turns play out in a very well-paced and (mostly) logical format resulting in the climactic (pun intended) collapse of the lead that results in the search of self which ends in a sweet and still funny happy ending.

Bravo to John Ritter for a movie that could not have been made with any other actor playing the lead. His combination of sincerity, naivete, sexuality and charm could only be matched by Michael J. Fox, yet such an actor would never have the sex appeal as Mr. Ritter. Anyone seeking an extension of THREES COMPANY would be sorely disappointed (in my opinion) as the acting is vastly more mature and sophisticated than at any time in the popular comedy show. John Ritter seems truly lost in his lack of introspection and his genuine effort to find his meaning of life.

Truly a magical movie that deserves far more credit and recognition within the pantheon of great movies.

This movie is much deeper than its skin... I cannot recommend more highly.

Skin Deep in my opinion, though 80's dated looks wise, is still a far superior drama/comedy.

John Ritter should have been nominated for this performance, PERIOD.

Ritter's more serious scenes are up there with the best actors of our time, and the comedy, especially the physical comedy (leaving electro-therapy scene, OMG, I have to rewind it several times because I can't see the scene all the way through from laughing so hard) is evidence that Buster Keaton & Chaplin have passed the torch to our dear beloved clown John Ritter.

The dialogue in this movie is truly wonderful, might be a bit brainy for some folks.

The physical comedy is hilarious. Most people cite the 'glow scene' but I prefer the 'shock therapy' scene.

But Ritters' performance is the show stealer. Very nuanced - you wonder how closely the script touched his own life. He played it to a ""T"" and then some.

Supporting cast is excellent, except the ex-wife who isn't so believable. And Gardenia is excellent as always.

345722,4,630141019X,"Slightly dirty, very funny and at times even sensitive, Skin Deep is a perfect film to curl up to on a Sunday evening and laugh well into the night. There's something charming about the late 80's and early 90's comedies that I like, perhaps since it was during my own childhood that they were made but there's something organic to them that many of today's movies lack like the grittiness and the look of the lenses it was shot with versus plastic and computer like movies of today.

The humor here is constant; John Ritter portrays a writer who's not only full of himself but also completely addicted to women and alcohol. After his marriage fails (it might have something to do with his many girlfriends) he falls into a slump, he can't write, he cant hold a relationship ( or doesn't want to) and is still obsessed with his ex wife, claiming that she's the only one who can fix him. There's non stop action and jokes, my favorite part was when he followed a foxy looking chick into a spa like retreat only to be subjected to electric shock therapy by an ex, walking out in jitters and at one point tripping on the stairs and grabbing someone's papers spilling them all over the building and then when he ran into a blind man, and couldn't let go of his walking stick, I was laughing so hard that I couldn't breathe, and I cant remember last time that happened to me.  I adored that there was a lot of heart in this, one really rooted for the poor deflated author who skimmed the surface of life with empty things that stopped exciting him after a while, and once the crazy things don't make you tick what is left to do? Trying his best to sober up he takes a new lease on life and wraps the story up with a great ending. I adored the whole movie and had a great time watching it.

This movie is Hilarious and (to me)tends to make more sense to aging delinquents who sort have been in those situations.

345764,4,630141019X,"MOVIE:

 Skin Deep, considered by many to be a non-favorite of the Blake Edwards catalog, should warrant some favorable recognition due to the solid performance by it's leading man, John Ritter. His character Zach, is plagued with troubles that can get the best of most men, including women, drinking and self discovery. He then fumbles his way through Blake's story with scant advise from his lawyer and his favorite bartender, played by Vince Gardenia. In an almost 'R' rated version of Jack Tripper, Ritter portays Zach to be a flawed yet likeable character who's downward spiral through the course of the picture has us rooting for a happy ending and some mental resolve.

 Comedicaly speaking, like most films, there are highs and lows. Skin Deep is not ment to be a Farley Brothers movie or a 'cute/gross' Ben Stiller date flick. It's a bit naughty in spots and even dramaticly satisfying in others. If you like both John Ritter's style of line delivery and his incredibley original physical comedy that he gave us on Three's Company, than you'll find a lot of humor where others might miss it. Remember when Jack Tripper rolled around head over heals while still in sitting 'indian style' on his apartement floor or when he would back down from a bully in that hysterical cowardess fashion that would make the audience crack up every time? Well, there's a bit of that charm here in this picture.

 Most people talk about the glowing condoms scene, which is quite original and funny, but it takes place in the dark and you only get to see glowing penises bounce around on screen for a few minutes. The real comedic scenes envolve Ritter's facial reactions and physical comedic timing. In one scenerio while in a drunken stuper, Zach leaves a bar with a female body builder and doesn't realize her massive figure until she's towering over him in bed explaining her rigorous work-out routine in detail. When she askes how he feels about being able to then sleep with her, Zach shyly replies ""Like Mrs. Arnold Schwarzenegger"".

 Another scene which has been overlooked in previous reviews of this film is the moment when he tries to leave a day spa after following a beautiful model to it's front doors only to find a bitter ex-girlfriend working there. After a few minutes of shock therapy, ment for muscle relaxation, poor Zach is walking like a man having random seizer attacks all the way back to his car. It's flawless, classic Ritter.

 ADVICE:

 If you are a John Ritter fan, see this movie. If you've enjoyed most of the pacing and story telling of Blake Edwards romantic comedies, see this movie. However, If you find that the films of the 80's don't live up to the gross-out fests of todays 'shock-em sock-em' comedies, then think twice. You might not enjoy Skin Deep to it's fullest.

 DVD:

 The widescreen option is nice but that's it. No extras. This is the only reason the DVD gets 4 out of 5 stars from me, however it is a relativly cheap DVD which you can probably pick up used on Amazon. So, until a special edition comes out, which probabley won't happen anytime soon, if ever, we John Ritter fans will have to make due.",1090281600,,3142,4.6854545454545455
345765,5,630141019X,"John Ritter stars as Zach who  is a womanizing writer/piano player, who  has just been caught cheating by his
girlfriend Angela Smith (Denise Crosby  from Star Trek the Next Generation who played
Tasha Yar).
What's funny about this is that Zach has a history of womanizing and cheating, in which  he has fullfilled the fantasies of every woman  he meets, yet he finds himself alone and  without someone he can really say he loves, with
the exception of his ex wife.
A bit phased by this Zach continues his  lifestyle until he realizes, it is perhaps  his ways with women that has resulted in  his short relationships.  He goes to his friend Barney the bartender  (Vincent Gardiana who is best known for
playing the police investigator on the heels of the vigilante killer, Charles  Bronson in Death Wish) who gives him
a couple of tips, but none of which help much.
The movie is funny because we see the character of Zach going from one mishap to another like  Jack Tripper's character in Three's Company  (which Ritter played). In one funny scene,
Zach dates a bodybuilding woman who in his
words leaves his private parts ""scared stiff"". LOL
Then in one of the more funny scenes, Zach and  his female character get caught in the dark  by the female's boyfriend, since both of them  are wearing glow in the dark condoms!!! It's  as funny as it sounds.  Blake Edwards who has been making great comedy films  for over 20 years, from early hits like
""10"", to more modern hits like ""Blind  Date"" and ""Skindeep"" , has  shown that he still has the romantic, comedic
touch.

345766,4,630141019X,"I've seen this funny Blake Edwards film before.  I saw it again recently on television and boy did they edit so much of it.  Shortly afterwards, we all got the shocking news that John Ritter unexpectedly died.  Interesting time to show this film, er ah, I mean ironic.  John Ritter and his work was making a comeback.  On television they were showing, The Waltons, Three's Company and the unforgetable film, The Other (1972) in which John Ritter played the role of ""Rider"".  John Ritter had a new tv series called ""8 Simple Rules..."".  It became a hit.  While rehearsing the fourth episode of the new season, John became ill and collapsed.  Rushed to the hospital.  He died during emergency surgery.  It was his heart.  In artery was leaking blood, a condition that can not be caught in x-rays. A condition John Ritter did not know he had.  The whole nation took pause at the passing of John Ritter on September 11, 2003.  This 1989 film stars John Ritter as a man going through mid-life crisis.  His woman (Denise Crosby, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"")catches him with another women first in the kitchen and then in the bedroom.  This time she is holding a gun right at him.  He sees a psychiatrist to find out what his problem is.  He loves women too much, but has such bad luck.  THIS MOVIE IS FOR ADULTS ONLY!  There are several scenes with John Ritter is wearing a glow-in-the-dark condom.  These particular scenes and all nudity are cut out of television prints.  This film is brilliantly written and directed by Blake Edwards (husband of Julie Andrews).  It is a comedy (like ""10"" with Dudley Moore and Bo Derek), but it is also serious too.  Some good dramatic acting by John Ritter.  Cast includes Vincent gardenia, Alyson Reed, Joel Brooks, Dee Dee Rescher and Sherl Lee Ralph.  Nice tune by Ivan neville, ""Falling Out Of Love"".

She finds a jealous female about to fatally shoot Hutton after she(the jealous female) catches him in bed with his female barber. This is where the Huttons' divorce begins. Hutton goes for advice from his bartender buddy Barney(the late Vincent Gardenia,famous for his role of Frank Lorenzo on ""All In The Family""). Angry Alex throws Zachary's typewriter out the window and into the swimming pool. Zachary wanted to remain married to Alex so he sought psychiatric help. He started by cutting down on his drinking and eventually cold turkey,quit. Zach found a new girlfriend Molly(Julianne Phillips) and they lived together. She became so angry with him at one point in the film that she set his piano afire while he was playing it!(Zach plays the piano also) The house and Zach's Mercedes both burned down in that fire. He also meets musclebound Loni Jones(she looks like Patrick Swayze!) at Barney's bar where he was playing the piano. They sleep together that night and when Zach awakes the next morning,he does aerobics in her class in his underwear! Next,there the death of his buddy Leon ""Sparky"" Sparks. Zach attends his funeral with another buddy Jake(Joel Brooks). Alex was at the funeral and she invited Jake over for dinner at her house. Although Zach wasn't invited,he showed up. So at the dinner Zach and Alex chat and Zach says how awful he's felt since their separation. Zach attends a black tie affair at the Century Plaza hotel dressed as a genie! He thought it was a Halloween party. Many of the guests laughed at him,even Jake. Jake nearly went to the affair as a cowboy! Then Zach finds out that Alex has another man who she plans to marry and almost did until Zach crashed the wedding. Alex's mother Marge always has hated Zach because of his behavior. So more therapy sessions follow,and Zach did more cutting down on his boozing and womanizing. By Christmas,Zach is no longer boozing and womanizing. He wrote a book which sold big and there was a party at Barney's in his honor. He and Alex have reconciled and drank lemon-lime soda instead of gin and tonic. Marge still hates Zach. She was being sarcastic when she said she was proud of Zach. But everyone else who hated him,loved him again. So Alex and Zach are in bed together in the last scene and she persuaded him to get rid of the glow-in-the dark condom which was first seen in an earlier bed escapade.

When Zack comes out of the office he is twitching so badly he can hardly walk.  This is classic John Ritter physicality.

Also, while very funny, this movie follows a man who is trying desparately to repair his life and at every turn keeps failing.  At one point, in his physcharist's office, his cry for help is so real-looking that it made me cry.

345784,3,630141019X,"""Skin Deep"" is a Blake Edwards black comedy that fails to be dark enough or funny enough to be worth the effort.  The most famous scene, which gave the film its infamous tagline as ""The comedy that glows in the dark,"" is at odds with the rest of the film, which only proves that in the final analysis this is not really a comedy.  John Ritter plays Zach Hudson whose problems with writer's block become next to nothing when his wife comes home to find that his mistress is holding a gun on him because she caught him with her hairdresser.  Zach drinks, but it is clearly more his incessant womanizing that is his biggest problem.  If you think about it realistically Zach is in a desperate straights, but the film does not play out as such.  It sketches his dire circumstances more than anything else.  Zach is really a pathetic figure, but Edwards does not allow the character to play out that way, so there is no lesson to be learned here.  Zach thinks he can joke his way out of any situation, especially if he has enough to drink, but even so he is never that funny or that tragic.
There is just something missing here that stops the film from clicking and I do not think the easy answer that this is recycled Blake Edwards holds up in the final analysis.  At face value there should be some funny bits here, especially as Zach makes his way through a gauntlet of women, such as a body builder, that should inspire some comic moments.  But even the glow in the dark scene falls flat because it does not get beyond the simple sight gag (same thing for the dog on the ceiling shot).  The funniest scene is pure physical comedy by Ritter after one his former paramours (Julianne Phillips) puts him through a complimentary herbal wrap and electro stimulation session.  In his heart of hearts Zach still loves his wife, Alex (Alyson Reed), but I get the feeling this is simply because that is what the wandering husbands in Blake Edwards movies do, amply proven by Dudley Moore in both ""10"" and ""Micki & Maude.""  Zach's alcoholism is also just there; not comic enough to be funny and not painful enough to illicit any other response, especially when sobriety is just one gag from God away.  In the end, Edwards tries to have it both ways and only succeeds in canceling everything out so there is really nothing left at the end of this film except a sense of sadness.",1047340800,,2365,4.4467592592592595

Now, that may sound like damning with faint praise, as the competition is such movies as ""Problem Child"", ""Hero at Large"" and ""Stay Tuned"", but ""Skin Deep"" is truly an achievement, a virtuoso performance by a man who is probably doomed to spend the rest of his days as a pratfalling, slapstick comedian.  But here, he shines, bringing true feeling to his performance.  You can feel the pain, humilation and defeat he suffers through the bright veneer of humor.
 This is the story of Zack Hutton, a talented writer who sinks into alcoholism and insecurity after he destroys his marriage by womanizing.  It's the story of a man who hits rock bottom and redeems himself.  For a goofy comedy, it's pretty poignant.
 The film is buoyed by amazing supporting performances by Vincent Gardenia as a wise bartender, Joel Brooks as best friend and attorney Jake and Dee Dee Rescher as jakes wife, Bernice.
 Invariably, people point to the scene ""that glows in the dark"" as a reason to watch this movie, but I think that famous scene is easilyt the silliest and most forgettable.  Funnier scenes abound and, if you pay attention, the movie is peppered with clever, underplayed dialog.

7813929,4,630141019X,"Nicole Kidman has a very very small role and shouldn't be listed as one of the stars.  However, I enjoyed seeing her in this movie and knowing how far she has come.  I don't know how old she was when filming but young.  And the era is off a bit.  The make-up & clothing is of the 70's and not the 60's.  If it weren't for the alcoholic's part I would have given this movie 5 stars.  I liked it as a whole.",1513900800,,405,3.819277108433735
7813930,5,630141019X,"This is one of Blake Edward's all time funniest movies. VERY hard to find though. Considering how rare it is, I think the price I paid was reasonable and the condition of the dvd was exactly as promised. Thank you.",1513036800,,214,4.375
7813931,5,630141019X,"This is the BEST John Ritter movie, had to replace our very old VHS tape with a pricey DVD, but worth every penny. Do what you have to do to see this movie. The premise is funny, some would call corny, but I love the dialogue and the humor, touching on mental illness and adultery and what it takes for some of us to make it through this life.",1512604800,,343,3.9855072463768115

7813934,3,630141019X,"I didn't  hate this movie, The acting was lack-luster, but respectable. Kind of like they were all on low dosages of Valium. Not awkwardly bad, just disappointingly, and/or inappropriately unresponsive. Some of the other reviews, describing it as funny, confuse me because at no point is this film even vaguely humorous. It's not a comedy, it's a somewhat sappy, too-slow-moving drama. I liked the retro-looking fashions.",1507507200,,421,5.378787878787879
7813935,1,630141019X,"Most reviews are for a different movie - same title but very different movie.  Also , not by / with Kidman - misleading - she only has a bit part",1506988800,3,145,3.8333333333333335
