8361589,5,B002BIGYDQ,"I have seen several Gnomon DVD's and this one is just as good :)  I Love Erik Tiemen's art, and he does a wonderful job explaining his process in this DVD. This is not a basic painting instructional DVD. It is more of a process and workflow video. If you want a fresh approach to thumbnails and visualizing ideas then get this DVD. If you want to learn how to paint try another video",1309132800,4,383,4.175675675675675

When I watch the film, I realize that the outward simplicity hides a fairly sophisticated design and use of color and value not to mention the imaginative creativity of Erik Tiemens.
From different landscape vews and places blended together in his mind, he starts to do some thumbnails, letting his imagination and creativity jus flow.
Then, he picks up the best composition from those thumbnails, the one that best match his creative needs, and start a new painting.
And you just watch everything coming together and the creation of a big world on a little piece of paper.
Watercolor and gouache in a way that I never saw been manipulated before.
There's only one little problem: At the end it tastes like: ""Ok, that's the entrance, now let me have the main dish"". But That was it.
And I want some more.
Please Mr. Tiemens.",1259280000,6,910,4.69375
