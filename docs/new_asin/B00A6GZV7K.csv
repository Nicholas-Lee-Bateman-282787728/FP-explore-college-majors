5382275,5,B00A6GZV7K,"Vito Russo was a very influential activist during the terrible aids crisis. This film chronicles his childhood, how he became an activist and the contribution he and his work made, and are still making to the gay community and society in general.",1372636800,2,246,4.880952380952381
5382276,5,B00A6GZV7K,"I first saw this on cable, then later bought the DVD. It is not only about extraordinary activist and film archivist Vito Russo, but about gay history. The archival film footage is amazing. I was stunned to see that there were problems amongst the gay community as early as 1973 (drag queens, lesbians, gay men at odds with each other). I didn't know that. I thought that all began in my generation (late 80's early 90's). Clips of Bette Midler can be seen that I have also never seen before.

The vintage cinematic clips (1890's till about 1970) are something to be cherished. A few seen herein are not seen in The Celluloid Closet DVD. We are so lucky Russo sought these things out and preserved them.

He seemed like a very exceptional person. As of 2013 we have NO ONE like him. Gay people have become extremely passive and complacent and we are losing gay neighborhoods yearly. Ken and Barbie types, as well as hipsters, are gentrifying us back into obscurity. So while this DVD made me extremely proud, there is a certain melancholy that comes with it, because the days of real activism and pride are gone.",1370649600,8,1112,4.582914572864322
5382277,5,B00A6GZV7K,"'Vito' is a brilliant documentary about a gay film scholar and activist. The investigation into Vito's research and writings that culminated in his landmark book 'The Celluloid Closet' is fascinating.

Vito's impassioned activism on behalf of sufferers of HIV/AIDS and his efforts to call out the media for its derogatory depictions of LGBT people remind us how important Vito Russo was to the gay community.

I'm so pleased that this documentary pays homage to such an important man who told the truth in an era that was particularly hostile to the gay community. Anyone who is interested in LGBT film or history will delight in this film - buy it today!",1370131200,2,655,4.891891891891892
5382278,5,B00A6GZV7K,"Excellent, educational and historical documentary.  I had read his book (in another lifetime) and saw the film that was based on the book (also a long time ago).

I had not realized, until after watching ""Vito,"" the very important role Vito Russo played in the gay liberation and AIDS movements.

There are a lot of great historical clips shown in this documentary as well as interviews with activists, writers, etc., whose lives Vito Russo touched.",1365552000,5,449,4.96

8546927,5,B00A6GZV7K,"Vito was a true hero. The interviews, footage, and pictures are wonderful. You need to watch this no matter how you identify. He was truly inspiring. I absolutely adore Vito's boyfriend from San Francisco 'cause I relate to him :). I highly recommend this documentary to all.",1510963200,,275,4.872340425531915
8546928,5,B00A6GZV7K,A great look back at the AIDS crisis of the 80's.,1472774400,,49,3.5454545454545454

8546930,5,B00A6GZV7K,Excellent film about the advocate.  Truly inspired me to purchase the DVD after renting it and also then to watch The Celluloid Closet.  Truly inspiring to the homosexual community and to those with open minds.,1452556800,,210,4.9714285714285715
8546931,5,B00A6GZV7K,I totally loved this film on Vito. He was a great man who represented LGBT people by reviewing past films for Gay content and he was an AIDS activist.,1447632000,,150,4.206896551724138
8546932,5,B00A6GZV7K,"Last night we watched ""Vito"" a documentary about gay activist, Vito Russo. I first became aware of Vito when he published ""The Celluloid Closet"" in 1981, a book about the depiction of gays and lesbians in Hollywood films as far back as the 1920s. Vito traveled the states and the world lecturing on this topic including college classrooms and various public venues.

Vito became a gay activist soon after the Stonewall riots and he was one of the first members of the GAA. He is a cofounder of both GLAAD and ACT UP and was a fierce proponent of gay rights and a leader in the push to get help for people suffering from AIDS from the beginning of the pandemic until his own dying breath in 1990.

This documentary film has a lot of great footage from early films and from the gay rights and AIDS activism days that no one should miss, especially if they are a member of the LGBT or allied community. Never underestimate for even one minute what one person can do to change the world for the better. Every bit of this movie is worth watching and may enlighten many on the steps taken and the hard work of many to get to the brink of full equality for LGBT citizens.

In one of those six degrees of separation things that seems to happen to me a lot, Vito's partner, Jeff Sevcik, is featured in the film. Jeff died from complications of AIDS in 1986. Jeff was one of the first friends I made in San Francisco when we both showed up as college freshman for Campus Kickoff (a program for freshman dorm residents at San Francisco State University). He became the dorm roommate of my hometown friend, Ron Patton. Jeff was also featured in an earlier film ""Common Threads: Stories From The Quilt"". There were so many pictures of Jeff in the film and it was both a wonder to watch and painful to behold.

This film should be mandatory viewing for any LGBT history class and I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to be aware of the activism in the past decades that have led our country to the brink of full equality for LGBT citizens.",1429056000,2,2030,4.39095744680851
8546933,5,B00A6GZV7K,"An excellent documentary about historian and activist Vito Russo. Russo, who wrote the groundbreaking study of gays in cinema ""The Celluloid Closet,"" also did tremendous work as a gay rights activist and AIDS activist. Colleagues, friends and family are interviewed about his life and career. Russo is also seen in interviews and television appearances. His childhood and experiences are discussed as well as his love of film and the long-range and exhausting research he did for ""Celluloid Closet"". The latter part of the film deals with the anguish and devastation of fighting for government assistance during the AIDS crisis and his untimely death from the disease in 1990.",1425340800,2,676,5.268518518518518
8546934,5,B00A6GZV7K,"Although I am a gay man, from the same generation and roughly the same age as Vito Russo, I'm reviewing this movie as a movie, rather than as a documentary about the gay rights movement.

There are lots of documentaries about that movement, but none of them are great movies. This one is. It is fascinating from beginning to end.

There's not one bit of martyr worship in this movie, as there always is in movies about Harvey Milk, for example. Vito, the movie, is just as smart and funny and honest and gentle and riveting and uncompromising as Russo was himself.

He was such a marvelous man that there's no need to paint him as a hero or a martyr or as anything else but just himself. I never felt like I was being preached to or manipulated in any way at all while watching this movie. I was just being allowed to visit with a really fantastic human being.

What a treat this movie is! I feel now like Vito is an old and very dear and very delightful personal friend. I look forward to meeting him for real when I get to where he is now.",1418860800,4,1041,4.21608040201005
8546935,5,B00A6GZV7K,"This documentary should rank up there with Common Threads and The life and times of Harvey Milk.  I believe all gays should watch each and every documentary about gays and events in gay history..  I hate when I hear some young guy in his 20's say something along the lines of ""I never heard of Boys in the Band, That isn't important to me.""  Bull.  Young gays should know why they are able to do what they do because of the Past.",1402358400,,429,4.195121951219512
