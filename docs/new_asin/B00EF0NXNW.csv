8604871,3,B00EF0NXNW,"Answer:  This Movie.  I came across this while looking for new entertainment for my 4.5 year old.  We watched about 30-40 min and she lost interest.  It's odd as she always seemed to be interested in Jack Frost and Elsa YouTube videos.  Oh well, I'm sure someday we will get through to the end.  I enjoyed it for a change of pace from Tinkerbell.  Worth the cost, would do it alll again.",1518134400,,387,4.291666666666667
