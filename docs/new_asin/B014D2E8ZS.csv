It urges me to listen to every note as I play and try to be more sensitive in my own playing and interpretations.  He is just so amazing with his skill.  He is so polished he almost makes it look easy, except that one know it is anything but easy.",1453248000,7,376,4.253521126760563
8730258,2,B014D2E8ZS,Lang Lang is so theatrical that it detracts from the viewing. I can only bear watching this CD if I close my eyes -- so why have the video at all?  His behavior at the keyboard is unnecessarily distracting. But this DVD has saved me from spending the money for a ticket to hear him in concert. That's very good!,1508544000,,311,4.183333333333334

8730264,4,B014D2E8ZS,"We had the pleasure of seeing/hearing Lang Lang perform this identical program from the sixth row of NJPAC's Prudential Hall, shortly after this disc was recorded.  I actually think the performances on this disc are superior to what we heard live, where he was in more of a pop star mode, than a musical one.  Additionally, we just returned from our first visit to France, where we spent a day at Versailles.  My only reservation of this Blu-ray is I wish they would have shown more features of Versailles during the performance or, perhaps, an intermission feature of Lang Lang touring this extraordinary venue.  The audio and video quality are very good.",1473811200,6,656,4.830357142857143

8730266,5,B014D2E8ZS,"The most amazing thing about this concert is that the entire audience is smiling at the end of the Chopin Scherzo's and again at the end of Tchaikovsky's Seasons. I know of no other pianist that has ever been able to radiate such joy and happiness in his playing! The Chopin is played in such an effortless manner that you soon forget about any technical difficulties and become completely absorbed in the music. There are countless expressive insights, drama, vision, and joy, which appears to be Lang Langs trademark. The sound is excellent employing Dolby Digital Stereo Surround Sound, and the photography beautiful with lots of closeups of Lang Langs hands to benefit students. Sir George Solti once said great composers should be canonized (given Saint status) since they profess the immortality of the human spirit in the universal language of music. By the same token, great artists must be born to deliver that message in a definitive manner. This concert does just exactly that, and is proof that Lang Langs birth was no accident.",1463443200,6,1040,4.948571428571428
