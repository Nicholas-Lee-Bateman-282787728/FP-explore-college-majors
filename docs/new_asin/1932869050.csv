7801599,5,1932869050,"This movie is a wonderfully informative documentary that shows the viewer how deep the pharmaceutical rabbit hole goes. It explains the mechanisms behind the sick dysfunctional system. It gives real examples of why things need to change. This movie should be required for all healthcare professionals. How many millions of people have to die before we wake up and be the change we want in this world. Big pharma as an industry is like the symbiotic parasite that starts killing it's host. We need to pull in the reins of this industry and focus on people NOT profits. This industry has been hijacked and is now used to enslave the unfortunate. Good luck finding this movie, I wish I could find my copy. Enjoy!",1423785600,,709,4.725806451612903
