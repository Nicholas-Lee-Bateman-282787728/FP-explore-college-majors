8463862,3,B005B3YXYK,"It's a good coming-of-age movie. I liked the acting from the BigBang members and the girl too. The movie is in widescreen but I don't mind. The subtitles do come in english only there are a few times where the phrases are backwards, I had already seen the movie online so I knew what they where suppose to say. The movie is good, and it has a good story and characters some people can relate to.",1409961600,,395,4.2105263157894735

Their acting was amazing, and the movie itself held the perfect balance between melancholy and amusing. Great movie :) Everyone should see it at least once",1354233600,,313,4.607142857142857
