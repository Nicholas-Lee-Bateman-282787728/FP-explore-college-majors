Fascinating to hear from abductees, implantees, human/hybrid cases,  native Americans,  other dedicated experts from all walks of life.  The other very interesting section was on UFO propulsion  (Aetheric Propulsion System invented/designed by a Canadian explaining how his system works).  Got to see what a hybrid thumb looks like; how an abductee's lung was cleansed from years of smoking; balls of light seen during crop circle formation; and orbs -- never saw a  heart-shaped or diamond-shaped orb!.  Fun, enlightening, informative!",1254960000,12,644,5.37
