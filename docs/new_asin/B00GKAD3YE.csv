8624013,5,B00GKAD3YE,"A classic of the Spanish cinema, in a gorgeous new print in HD. I've seen this film a dozen times and love it. Sara Montiel's breakthrough into superstardom in the Spanish-speaking world is an experience all lovers of old melodramas should have. She is gorgeous, sings and acts divinely. One can easily see why EL ULTIMO CUPLE made history in 1957 Spain.",1421452800,,354,4.725806451612903

8624015,5,B00GKAD3YE,"The Movie ""El Ultimo Cuple""  is excellent.  Have seen it many times and find it as interesting and worth watching as the first time I watched it.  Sara Montiel was a first class actress and songstress!!!

It is a shame though, that the copy used for the DVD transfer is so bad, that the VHS copy I had and the double feature I bought for Amazon several years ago are better than the copy on this DVD which I paid $35.00 U.S.  I paid for the double feature  ( el Ultimo Cuple/ La Violetera)  $5.99 U.S.  Would have been better just to keep that cone instead of Spending the extra #35.00 for what I thought  would be the restored copy of El Ultimo Cuple.  Fery unhappy with the purchase,  but the movie is still great.

If you are thinking of buying the new release,  @ $35.00, you are better off buying the $5.99 DVD.",1397347200,3,816,4.220779220779221
