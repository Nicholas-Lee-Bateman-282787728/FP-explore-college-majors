1238323,4,B00000JSJ9,"The intrusion of junkmail materialising in the TARDIS, leads the Doctor and Ace to the Planet Seganox, where the main attraction is the Psychic Circus, where clowns are sinister, and the audience has to perform for their lives! After an inauspicous debut for Stephen Wyatt with ""Paradise Towers"", ""Greatest..."" is like Hamlet! One of the most psychadelic Who stories since ""The Claws of Axos"". Everyone involved is in fine form, even with the production nightmare. The last two seasons of Who are filled with layers of intrigue and mystery, something lacking in the program since the Hartnell and Troughton eras. Some might say that this adventure is a metaphor of the production, the fans and the program's adversaries(such as Star Trek, the executives of the BBC, ect). Whiz Kidd is every Doctor Who fan in an exagerated form. The Doctor leaving the Circus at the end as the tent explodes is not to be missed! ""You ain't seen nothing yet!""",944006400,4,941,4.8875
1238324,5,B00000JSJ9,"When I started watching Doctor who it was with the Doctor Who, played by Sylvester McCoy.  As his seasons were not always the best to say the least this is one of only a couple that he had really good writing for.  I have  always been partial to him, because that is the Doctor I began watching the  series first with.  I definately recomend this film to anyone is a fan of  the Doctor.",939427200,2,386,4.148648648648648
1238325,4,B00000JSJ9,"With this serial, Doctor Who ascended ground-breaking new heights. The director, Peter Ubute took the brave step of including interprative dance routines in place of a normal narrative in certain scenes. Thus the Doctor  and his companion tie each other up in black ribbons as a metaphor for  their fear of the unknown, and all the villains that feature dress in white  to symbolise deceit and cunning.  This story stands out from other Doctor  Who stories for its sheer artistic merit, and the performances of all the  cast, who make what could have been a disastrous experiment into a great  success.",939254400,7,602,4.900990099009901

7913394,1,B00000JSJ9,"This is, in my opinion one of the worst Doctor Who Serials ever! The only things we see in this is a rapping ringmaster that can't rap and Ace proving she's normal by claiming that she has a problem with clowns. The only thing that is worth watching in this horrible story is the part at the end where Sylvester McCoy walks away from an explosion that went off to early. All together you can skip this one and you wouldn't miss a thing.",1336953600,,436,4.2023809523809526
7913395,2,B00000JSJ9,"I actually disagree with those who consider this one of the worst ever episodes of Doctor Who, a hard standard to meet by any stretch of the (my) imagination.  This episode is perfectly representative of what Doctor Who was becoming by the era of the last two Doctors: Underfunded camp pantomime dreck -- Precisely what the BBC execs. always intended for the show, and precisely the excuse they were looking for to drive the ratings low enough to justify cancelling the rotten thing.  Setting the whole absurd episode in a ridiculous circus tent was pure brilliance and drives the point home beautifully.

7913396,1,B00000JSJ9,"Sorry to say but this episode is certainly not one of the better Doctor Who stories, in fact I would place it in the bottom 10%. I found it poorly explained, tiresome and pretty boring overall with little real suspense between episodes. Nearly all the characters in this episode are charmless or just plain annoying to watch. The audio track is sometimes hard to hear or understand as the characters seem to be quitely muttering between themselves and forgetting about us the audience! A very unappealing Doctor Who.",1101859200,,516,4.875
7913397,4,B00000JSJ9,"Hey, a story with a title describing how I feel about Doctor Who!  The Doctor and Ace land on Segonax, home of The Psychic Circus, which back in its earlier days, was a travelling entertainment show.  Well, it's the same way on Segonax, except that it's more like a terminal case of the Gong Show or Survivor.
Coming to perform are Nord the Vandal, a brutish musclebrain on a roaring three wheeled bike with cow's horns for handlebars, wearing a winged helmet, intergalactic explorer Captain Cook and his assistant Mags, and the Whizz Kid, a skinny nerd with thick round glasses who's the Psychic Circus's biggest fan.  Cook is a khaki-uniformed, pompous, selfish boor, looking out for number one, and quick to bore anyone with his travels.  ""I remember something similar happening on the planet...""  He drops more planet's names than I've had hot meals.  Well, maybe not that much, but you get the idea.
The Doctor, Cook, Mags, and Nord are captured, each awaiting their performance.  Cook comes up with a survival of the fittest philosophy, all the while sitting leisurely at tea.  He says it best concerning the Circus:  ""Anyone dumb enough to get into the ring gets killed.""  Or anyone unaware of the dangers, I'd like to add.
The Circus's employees are either disenchanted and rebelling (Bellboy and Flowerchild), under the thrall of the current owners (Ringmaster, Morganna the fortune teller, the Chief Clown), or mentally damaged (Deadbeat).  It's the latter who actually helps the others discover the mystery of who's behind the Circus.
Ian Reddington (Chief Clown) has effective makeup that makes him look like the Joker from the Batman TV series.  Veteran actor T.P. McKenna plays Cook to oafish, smarmy perfection, and Jessica Martin has an expressive, appealing, and exciting (in the cliffhanger to Episode 3) performance as Mags.
I got two things out of The Greatest Show In The Galaxy, one of the shows last superlative moments.  It's an allegory on TV culture, demands by the viewers for better shows and by the BBC for better ratings.  Cook's comments while in the cage point to this:  ""Your chance of survival in the ring are better if you keep them entertained.""  The Doctor asks, ""Why, will they let you out again?""  ""No, you'll last longer.""  Whizz Kid is a stereotypical anal-retentively obsessed TV program fan, the family is the viewers, the ones in control the BBC, the Chief Clown the BBC Controller, and the Ringmaster and Morganna the BBC programmers.
However, it's also an allegory about warm and small businesses taken over by a larger, impersonal corporate entity.  The difference with the Circus is, the only way out is to be killed.  Bellboy wistfully tells Ace how the Circus used to be.  ""We all had high ideals when we started.  We shared everything, enjoyed making people happy.  If we all had a problem we'd sit down and talk it through.  We were so happy.""  He's so disenchanted over the death of Flowerchild, he doesn't want to go on living:  ""the fun and freedom of being what you want to be all gone.  They took everything bright and beautiful and buried it.""  Morganna says ""We used to have fun.""  The Ringmaster tells her that they are part of a machine and more successful now, and that the other employees ""couldn't take the pace.  They wanted to live in the past, ... in the old lazy ways.""  If this is the future of all workplaces, then give me the past, give me liberty, or give me death.",1029801600,5,3437,4.774576271186441
7913398,4,B00000JSJ9,"In a way, this story encapsulates the good and bad aspects of the McCoy era.  On the one hand, the humor is sharp, the characters are more interesting, and the story is more imaginative than anything in the Colin Baker or later Davison eras.  McCoy was also, to me, more convincing as the Doctor than either of his two immediate predecessors.  On the downside, it's obvious the show's budget wasn't stretching as far as it once had, and the writers' ideas don't coalesce into a comprehensive-- or fully comprehensible --whole.  This dichotomy affects all the McCoy stories to some degree, but this story and ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" perhaps best demonstrate the era's virtues without becoming object lessons of its faults (as ""Battlefield"" and ""Silver Nemesis"" did, respectively).",1015804800,,783,5.09375
7913399,1,B00000JSJ9,"This story falls under a very small category of Dr. Who for me... episodes I'm too scared to watch. From the moment the rapping ringmaster cracks his whip and starts to gyrate to the corny rapping beat you know this is going to be a pretty bad episode. The character names are ridiculous... Pig Pen, Kingpin, and Flower Child. The particulars of the plot are annoying... people going out to perform for the Gods of Ragnorock. We've got a corny, nerdy fan boy, an effete English explorer, and a Werewolf with all the scariness of a member of ths cast of Cats. How could even the most talented actor do a good job pulling off a story with names, costumes, and dialogue like this! There's also a scene where the doctor performs vaudeville style which just doesn't work on TV. The decline of Dr. Who was not Sylvester Mckoys fault however. He was a good Doctor on a bad show. Nor was it John Nathan Turners fault...",1015804800,3,911,4.461077844311378
7913400,1,B00000JSJ9,"A poor attempt at a ""surreal"" advenutre. Indicative of the Sylvester McCoy era (which isn't really his fault, as much as the writers). A shame  that many who had seen this and others by McCoy apparently didn't  see the adventures of the first six Doctors and how it used to be done.  Strangely enough, the actoing was alright but the plot was lame. If you  want to buy or rent a McCoy adventure, I'd recommend ""Remembrance of  the Daleks or  ""The Happiness Patrol"", the only two bright spots  of the McCoy era which harken back to the days of the show when it was far  more popular and had much higher ratings.",950745600,3,610,4.383928571428571
7913401,5,B00000JSJ9,"It grieves me that some people judge McCoy's era (which was one of the series' highest points) on his first few adventures.  Most of the stories of Seasons 25 and 26 are examples of how the McCoy era changed overnight  from being a bland, garish pantomime into an era filled with multi-layered  stories, the kind of genuine mystery surrounding the central character  unseen since the sixties and a wonderfully dark, unchildish  atmosphere.
'Greatest' is a classic.  Whether or not you're scared of or  suspicious of clowns there's no doubting they make good villains.  The  psychic circus' Chief Clown especially is excellently portayed.  The story  is filled with strong characters, including T.P.McKenna's scheming Captain  Cook, the youthfully innocent Mags who hides a sinister secret.  The  Whizzkid is a humorous parody of the most irritating kind of Dr Who fan:  ""I never got to see the early days.  I know it's not as good as it  used to be but I'm still terribly interested"".  There is also a  marvellously creepy family watching the show, providing an association with  the audience by saying what the viewer is thinking.  The psychic circus  itself is genuinely eerie and the whole 4 episodes are filled with  refreshing originality, good design and well-thought-out ideas, all  assisted by one of the very finest Dr Who soundtracks.",949017600,9,1344,5.059633027522936
7913402,2,B00000JSJ9,"Frankly, reading the other reviews I'm a bit puzzled. Ok, more than a bit, to be honest. The episode that *I* saw had a weak and underdeveloped plot line, a cheesy music score that was played too loudly most of the time  (admittedly that may be due to my own copy of the episode), over-acting and  bad scripting. From the first unbelievable premise- a junk mail robot  somehow *invades* the Tardis- the show just went downhill. Why were there  dark gods on the planet? Why did King Pin/ Dead Beat go to the planet  looking for them in the first place? Why did the circus people cooperate  with them in killing people? Why was there a medallion to defeat them?  How  did the Doctor get into their ""alternate universe?"" (I just don't  accept psychedelic color sequences as reasons, I'm afraid). The show *did*  have a few redeeming qualities: Captain Cook was one of the best villains I  have ever seen, the clowns were indeed creepy, and the family was quite  disturbing. However, these minor points do very little to save such a  poorly conceptualized episode.",945302400,6,1060,4.664864864864865
