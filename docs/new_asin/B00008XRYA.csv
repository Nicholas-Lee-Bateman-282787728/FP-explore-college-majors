7987812,2,B00008XRYA,Movie wasn't that great. The only good thing it has are the two stars and even that is only truly appreciated for fans only.,1520380800,,124,4.208333333333333
7987813,5,B00008XRYA,"Movie's don't get much more campy or corny than this, but reliving old memories don't get any better either. Santo and Blue Demon are legendary in Mexican Lucha Libre and were the Mexican action heroes of their day. The DVD is surprisingly a good quality copy, and mindless campy fun as well.",1517788800,,292,4.634615384615385
7987814,5,B00008XRYA,"This one has all the action and ""luchador extracurricular activities"" (SEE! Santo and Blue Demon play chess while doing a really crappy job of being bodyguards!) one likes to see in these movies.  But it's actually pretty effective as a horror movie too - it has a feel similar to the Hammer movies from around the same time, albeit with more wrestling.  There's even an interesting twist related to Eric, the ""Renfield"" type character, that I don't recall ever seeing in any other vampire movie.

Note that the full title is Santo Y Blue Demon Contra Dracula Y El Hombre Lobo, and that this particular version of the movie, from Rise Above Entertainment's ""Santo Collection,""  appears to be out of print.  This is important because the Rise Above editions of these movies include English subtitles, and the current versions from VCI have no English (or even Spanish) subtitles.",1514851200,,878,4.905405405405405
7987815,4,B00008XRYA,"That's the announcer describing El Angel Blanco and Renato el Hippie flattening Blue Demon in a tag team fight (1 of 3 lucha libre matches during the movie). Renato the Hippie is a giant unmasked opponent, taller than both Santo and Blue Demon.
Anyway, this is one of the best Santo y Blue Demon flicks I've seen, and my first ever encounter with a Dracula who speaks Spanish. As a vampire purist it pains me to see el Hombre Lobo thrown in with a vampire, but what can you do...

Notable humor:

 Dracula, who's apparently crappy at fist fights, was mainly a threat through hypnotism. But he gives Lina (the lovely Nubia Mart) fair warning that he will hypnotize her. Gotta love those villains who talk long enough for the hero to show up.

 Blue Demon, hands tied behind his back, is made to walk a plank over a pit full of upward jutting spikes. Too bad he wore his shoes with tall heels that day! (what a horrible decade to be stuck in...) Of course Santo saves him from peril, and then Dracula and el Hombre Lobo stand frozen while their henchmen have a wild fight with Santo and Blue Demon. Dracula doesn't seem to have a plan B for most situations...

 When Santo tells Lina (Santo's girlfriend) to stay at home because he's going into a dangerous situation, she tails him to the dangerous rendezvous and promptly saves both Santo and Blue Demon from a grisly death by fire.",1446249600,3,1381,4.47808764940239
7987816,5,B00008XRYA,"Thanks to Amazon i was able to add this particular opus to my collection.  It has been out of print for a long time and being able to watch it brought back memories of the Sunday afternoons in Southern California.  It also brought back memories of attending school in Mexico City across the street from the studios that filmed these turkeys at Campestre Churubusco.

This particular tale features all the elements you expect from Santo except he has a fellow good guy The Blue Demon.  Blue willingly participates in the mayhem.  Totally money well spent.",1430956800,2,554,4.7894736842105265
7987817,4,B00008XRYA,"Four hundred years ago, Count Dracula and the Wolf Man attempted to unite the powers of Darkness but were foiled by one man, the alchemist Elco Cristaldi. Today, at the end of the cabalistic time, Dracula has risen anew and he turns his vengeful eye on Cristaldi's descendants. Except that one of them, the lovely Lina Cristaldi, happens to be El Santo's girlfriend. Sucks for Dracula.

In Mexico, professional wrestlers (or ""luchadores"") enjoy near mythic heights of popularity, and no one is more revered or celebrated than El Santo. Santo inhabits a special place in Mexican cinema, his more than fifty films an extension of his real life professional wrestling career. Lucha Libre is a realm in which the luchadores are nearly regarded as real life superheroes. And so it wasn't really a stretch for Santo to cross over into motion picture as a caped crime-fighter. And he never, never ever took his silver mask off. What helped to sell Santo was that he always exuded a quiet nobility. He seemed so trustworthy and solid and heroic. This translated to box office cha-ching.

In cinema the decades would see Santo come face to face with all manner of threats, ranging from spies to robots to aliens to supernatural beasties and ghoulies. DVDs of Santo's films are notoriously hard to come by, especially with English sub-titles. SANTO Y BLUE DEMON CONTRA DRACULA Y EL HOMBRE LOBO (or ""Santo & Blue Demon Versus Dracula & the Wolf Man"") is another surreal Santo adventure, released back in 1973. I say ""surreal"" because Santo's films never strived too hard to place our hero in the real world. Or in a grounded story, for that matter. It's okay. Santo's world is one in which the man never takes his mask off and no one says diddly. It adds to the charm, the Santo films' persistent dismissal of reality, and that there isn't much continuity linking the films together. Each adventure seems to have Santo with a different love interest.

This film doesn't break a sweat when it shrugs off internal continuity. Keen focus is paid on the mystical dagger of the Boidros, a weapon of which Dracula is very leery. And yet, when it comes down to it, the sacred dagger doesn't even factor into the disposing of Dracula and the Wolf Man. Still, I like the neat twist involving the dagger and the hunchback henchman. Even if it's not quite the payoff I was expecting.

There are wrestling matches, naturally, and these are rugged contests staged without the fake stuff, without the melodramatic preamble and the soap opera and the rigged referee and the breakaway chair. But it's all about Santo and his formidable (and deeper-voiced) partner Blue Demon taking on the vile forces of Darkness (as well as a troop of garden variety hoodlums). Aldo Monti, who plays Dracula, comes off as a poor man's Christopher Lee. The Wolf Man (Agustn Martnez Solares) is made less ridiculous by dint of his appearing for most of the film in his human guise. But since the Wolf Man's name is Rufus Rex and he does go around part of the time wearing a gold lam disco shirt, he's still ridiculous. There's just no place in the world for a rico suave lycanthrope.

Radio wrist watches. Those short, short mini-skirts. That ominous yet kitschy organ music that occasionally passes for the movie score. A luchador named ""Renato the Hippie."" No surprise that a sense of campiness infuses this joint, but don't let that stop you from relishing a slew of fun beats. Such as Santo and Blue Demon in repose and playing chess. Or the free-for-all smackdown in the underground cavern which features a precarious catwalk hanging over a pit of sharpened stakes. Or the awesomely cheesy dialogue, such as when the Wolf Man suggests recruiting the luchadores to the infernal cause, and his hunchback lackey retorts: ""It would be useless, master. El Santo is a retrograde man. He still believes in good and justice. The other masked man is also an imbecile."" Heh.

7987818,3,B00008XRYA,"There are fans of the mexiluchahero film genre who consider this to be the last classic film to star Santo and Blue Demon together as a crimefighting, south of the border dynamic duo. In it they team up to wrestle the principalities and powers of darkness represented by Count Dracula and el Hombre Lobo(the Wolfman).Once again el Santo has to fight a centuries old curse. This time however he realizes he can't get the job done alone and calls in back-up in the form of the Blue Demon. This was one of the few films from the series where Blue Demon was treated as an equal partner to the Man in the Silver Mask and not just as some sort of sidekick. The story has Dracula planning to enslave humankind using an army of werewolves and vampires. El Santo has a cute little girl friend in this flick who likes to wear really short skirts and whose family are the victims of Dracula's vengeance. The undead Count is portrayed by Aldo Monti who had previously essayed the role in the film Santo and the Treasure of Dracula. Augustin Martinez Solares plays his sidekick Rufus Rex,the Wolfman. Unlike Lon Chaney Jr. or Matt Willis this  wolfman is no tortured soul. In his human form he wears outfits that look like they came from Tom Jones stage wardrobe,and he seduces the heroine's sister. The film's big weak spot, to me at least, are the three luchador matches found within. Both Santo and Blue Demon have a singles match and at the end of the film there's a tag-team bout. But all three bouts are done sans audience. It's as if the producers of this film couldn't afford to film in an actual arena and just decided to use a ring and dub in crowd noises. The effect is unsettling and brings down the rest of the film. Perhaps they should have just used stock footage of some previous matches. Oh well,at least this flick is blessed with English sub-titles and I do recommend it to fans of the genre. If you're new to this genre I recommend an earlier film like Santo vs. the Vampire Women or The Shadow of the Bat to start off with.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samson-Vs-Vampire-Women/dp/B00005U147/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samson Vs.
