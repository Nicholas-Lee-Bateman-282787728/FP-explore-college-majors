8147491,4,B000IUCCR6,"Some people hear ""Kamasutra"" and expect porn - this movie is not porn - basic it is ""R-rated"".  The premise of the dvd is to show a little ""T&A"" while demonstrating some sexual positions for couples looking to spice up their love life.  The highlight is seeing the ample attributes of Katya Santos (from the show ""Juanita Banana"" on philipino tv). Using Amazon's scale of 1 to 5 stars: I give it eight stars for Katya (four stars for each breast) and one star for the movie. If you want a skin flick, this not for you. If you are a fan of Katya - I would (and did) buy the DVD. Tagalog language.",1290816000,,595,4.2105263157894735
8147492,1,B000IUCCR6,"First of all, this is narrated in the native Phillipine language with no subtitles. Occassionally, an understandable word or phrase is uttered like ""missionary position"" or ""nerve endings"", but the rest is incomprehensible. The women are beautiful but you see them only from the belly button up. Then they are shot through a filter attempting to give the film an artistic feel, but it really looks like they used a dirty lense. The men are decorated with what looks like prison tats and no words are exchanged between the partners. There is some gentle rocking back and forth and, occassionally, up and down but that's it folks.",1171929600,10,628,4.878504672897196
