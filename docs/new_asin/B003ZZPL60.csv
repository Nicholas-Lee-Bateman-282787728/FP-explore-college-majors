8411462,5,B003ZZPL60,Dale Cougar takes it step by step how to make the rings and other jewelry out of wire.  I would recommend the beginner series first and then the intermediate series.  She shows you how to do all of it and she is really good at explaining how she does it.  I have both sets and really like them both.,1409097600,2,299,4.033898305084746
