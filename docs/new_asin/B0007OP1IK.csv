8049683,3,B0007OP1IK,"Corney. True ""tweener"" between Silent movies and talkies. Lots of exaggerated facial expressions and body motions.  Kind of funny to watch, but the audio quality is terrible.  There is a constant low frequency in the background, and  volumes of people's voices drop to nearly inaudible at times.  The plot is not unusual for vintage westerns.  A ""good guy"" gets thrown in jail with a ""bad guy,"" and they escape together so the good guy (Maynard) can follow along to the loot.",1476144000,,475,4.814814814814815

The story begins with a Texas Ranger showing his horsemanship skills. Larry will enter a contest. His horse ""Rocky"" wears special blinders to only look forward. ""So its you."" Anita Saunders wants to be the first female Ranger in Texas. Larry Graham will be sent on a special assignment. Ace Belden hid $250,000 in bonds from bank robbery and they want to recover this money. ""A lot of luck."" Larry is sent to prison as a life prisoner. Larry plans an escape with Ace that night. A Thompson spits bullets but misses the men. They hop into a waiting car and flee. Captain John Saunders explains the plan to Anita. Ace finds a refuge at Dave Stone's house. Larry meets Captain John, but is observed! Anita wants to help Larry. Tim Raymond talks about his skills. His identity is discovered! He flees and is pursued by Stone's gang to the end.

The drama comes from the conversation in the kitchen. Stone's gang knows Larry's background, and Larry knows that they know! Larry escapes on his horse. Stone and Ace disagree over sharing the loot. Ace travels to a deserted cabin to retrieve those bonds. Larry follows him inside. There is a fight. Anita shows up, and rides away. Stone's gang chases her, believing her to be Ace. Larry stops two of the men with a lasso, then catches up to Stone. There is a fight. The bonds are recovered, the villains are caught. The loose ends are left untied.

This story starts out with an interesting plot but becomes an average movie. Kermit was the brother of rodeo star Ken Maynard. This movie was adapted from a story by James Oliver Curwood.",1277596800,,1608,4.615384615384615
