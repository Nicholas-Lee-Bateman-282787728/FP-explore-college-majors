8113787,3,B000ERVKK8,"due to poor picture quality although a good movie with a good story and war actions during ww2
Waiting for a better DVD quality and in widescreen............",1384646400,2,157,4.851851851851852
8113788,2,B000ERVKK8,"Familiar, predictable post WWII revenge film. After his interrogation, an OSS agent  is left to die by his Nazi interrogators, who, by the way, were responsible for the death of his whole village, including his pregnant wife. Of course, he miraculously survives, and after the war he vows revenge on the six men responsible. The main problem with the film is that, with one exception, the revenge killings come all too easy and too quickly - no suspense at all here. Moreover, the quality of the transfer to DVD is poor and the dialogue is out of synch with the film. All in all, no reason to watch this.",1362787200,4,604,4.541284403669724
8113789,3,B000ERVKK8,"Time to Die - WW II Revenge Plot w/Rod Taylor & Rex Harrison.  This film is about a young American spy in Germany during WW II.  He is shot in the back of the head and left for dead but his wife is among the rest of the successfully executed townsfolks.  CIA agent Rod Taylor helps him get revenge against all the ""bad"" guy executioners except their leader, then Nazi Col, but now lesser among post-war leader evils and now CIA-favored, Rex Harrison. After Harrison is killed Taylor lets the young revenge-taker live and get away.  It's predictable but not very satisfying.",1318809600,,573,4.588235294117647
8113790,3,B000ERVKK8,I was disappionted with the quality of the disc I received. The Actors would have been the main draw for this movie. The story line was dramatic and I felt some of it was a bit fanciful,1306281600,,185,4.027027027027027
8113791,1,B000ERVKK8,I remembered this movie from the 80's and was keen to see it. The DVD quality was awful. The movie was a bit average as well. If you have a fond memory of this movie form a previous viewing don't ruin it by buying this dvd. Very disappointing!,1304812800,,243,4.083333333333333
8113792,2,B000ERVKK8,"The picture quality was poor, clearly copied from a VHS Tape. Worse, the dialogue ran about half a second after the action as though done with a poor dubbing job. Pretty good story though.",1282521600,5,188,4.5588235294117645
8113793,3,B000ERVKK8,"Read the book and was suprised to find out there was a movie.  Didn't expect it to be available on DVD, but here it was on Amazon.  The book was far more interesting and more detailed.  Still glad I saw it but it was no where near as good.",1271635200,,239,3.836734693877551
