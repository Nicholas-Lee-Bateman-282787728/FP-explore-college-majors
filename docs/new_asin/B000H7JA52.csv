8137406,4,B000H7JA52,"Anyone who has scanned over my reviews knows how much I enjoy these masked Mexican wrestler/Superhero films.  This movie is another exciting example of just why El Santo was a much loved hero and such a huge draw to both the Mexican wrestling fans and cinema goers throughout his career.  Having just thwarted a Martian invasion of Earth in the film immediately preceding this one, Santo this time gets involved in a slightly more mundane run-in with Mexican gangsters and con men who have infiltrated the wrestling world, and in an oddly connected way, are trying to extort inheritance money out of his god daughter.  The plot of this 1966 entry may be a lot less outlandish than Santo Vs the Martian Invasion, but the story is engaging, and the action and fight scenes are top notch.  It seems as though a fight erupts every five minutes or so, and for once they're all connected to the plot in some way, both in the ring and out, rather than just being used as filler to pad out the running time of the film.

Santo appears throughout the movie in his customary wrestling garb, mask, and cape.  This seems to be one of the last films in which he wears that outfit almost exclusively.  In later films, his wrestling attire was mostly limited to being worn in the ring, except, of course, for the ever present silver mask, which he always wore to accessorize a wide assortment of stylish threads - mostly slacks, turtlenecks, and sports coats.  But in this film, we are once again treated to the bizarre spectacle of El Santo visiting friends, attending the reading of a will, and just lounging about his home decked out in full wrestling regalia.

As I mentioned, there are a lot of fight scenes in this movie, perhaps more than any other of Santo's films I have seen.  And while the villains' method of extorting money might be highly improbable at best, it all makes a weird kind of sense within the established universe of Mexican lucha libre films, in which I learned a long time ago, pretty much anything goes.  So while there are no invading aliens, vampires. zombies, or monsters in Santo Vs the Villains of the Ring, there is a coherent storyline, and a ton of action, all rounded out by pretty decent acting by almost everyone involved.  Oh, and there is a pretty creepy seance sequence as well.  When all is said and done, El Santo once again drives away into the night behind the wheel of his MGA sports car.  And that's yet another reason I love his character and this movie.  My very first car many years ago was just like his, though I never wore a silver mask while driving it.

As far as I know, this is the first Distrimax DVD I have owned.  It's quite a nice copy, the B&W full frame print perhaps looking a bit soft at times, but with a minimum of dirt or specks appearing to distract from the overall quality.  It has very easy to read optional English subtitles, as well as a scene selection menu, but that's about it for features.  The sound quality is very good.  Overall, I was quite pleased, and would be happy to purchase more of their products.

One last thing.  The Amazon description says this movie is in color.  It isn't, and I did not expect it to be.  According to the Wikipedia entry on El Santo and his movies, this is the last of his films to be made in black and white.  While I greatly enjoy his colorful later cinematic outings, I must confess to being somewhat partial to the earlier B&W adventures of the great El Santo.  Hopefully, armed with this information, you can make a decision as to whether this DVD ought to be on your shelf.  It is now on mine, and I'm most happy with this addition to my collection.",1362182400,3,3654,4.463855421686747
