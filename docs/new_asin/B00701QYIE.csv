5045845,5,B00701QYIE,"I have this series in VHS though most of the tapes are now in pretty bad shape. I noticed that this series will be available on DVD but some had questioned whether the DVD series would be the original or would two of the tapes not be included due to U.S. Government security concerns with regards to Afghanistan. If this is the complete series, I would gladly purchase it but doubt if I will if it is ""sliced & diced"". Anyone have advanced information on this upcoming DVD copy?

5045846,5,B00701QYIE,"finally - the best ever series on the Cold War on dvd. I watched this on tv some years ago and wore out my home made vhs tapes of the series after repeated viewing. As far as I can see - pretty much every aspect of the Cold War period is dealt with in fair detail. If you want more - Vietnam for example - you have series like VIETNAM - A TELEVISION HISTORY - so its quite like THE WORLD AT WAR in that regard. I found the last couple of episodes on the collapse of communism and the USSR of particular interest. Again like THE WORLD AT WAR, the interviews with old participants - such as Mikhail Gorbachev - are fascinating. This is tv history as it should be. Brilliant.",1332288000,23,672,4.098484848484849

5045848,5,B00701QYIE,"An excellent documentary series on the Cold War, from pre-World War II to the collapse of the Soviet Union.  There are a couple dozen episodes on 6 DVDs and they're all good.  They cover the Cold War in time sequence, interviewing lots of people who were involved at the time and filling in the gaps.  It's a very thorough, if not exhaustive (forgive me:  I always want more when things are done this well) series.  Once upon a time the major networks did more of this kind of reporting and a little less of the 10 second headlines followed by enough ads to put you to sleep.  It's nice to find something like this is still available and still informative years after it was made.

Highly recommended.",1457481600,,701,4.47244094488189

5045850,5,B00701QYIE,"This film by the BBC brought has back a lot of memories to me. So while I beg to differ with some of the comments by some of the speakers. Like Gen. Westmoreland and how he had ""not"" been caught flat footed by the V.C. and the N.V.A. during the TET Offensive of 68. It also caught & showed some of the absolute arrogance of the Baby Boomers and their protesting of almost everything in America. (I myself frankly think that America had a collective nervous breakdown in 1968) The other point of views chosen & expressed in this film were well thought out and presented.
  I also was surprised by what happened on the other side of the Iron Curtain as told in this film. Especially on the attempted modernization of the USSR by Khrushchev. That & his secret speech which was leaked by the Mossad  which denounced Stalin and his tyranny. It was sad on how Castro was the major factor that caused his downfall from power. I shall not go on and expose things that will amaze and surprise a potential buyer from viewing this excellent film. Except to say that the choice of Mr. Kenneth Branagh was top drawer.
  All in all it is well worth the time and coin I spent on this and I highly commend it to those who are interested in this period of history!.",1449446400,2,1248,4.339055793991417

5045854,5,B00701QYIE,"After stumbling upon the Afghanistan episodes on YT, I ordered the DVD set and what a gem I unearthed. It might be the best documentary series I have ever witnessed.

The episodes are - as far as I can tell - unbiased, neutral and historically accurate. They cover spies, atomic weapons, SDI, Cuba, Vietnam, the space race an much more. Many historical figures a featured eg. Gorbachev, C. Rice.

The narration is pleasantly unagitated which makes it a very ""European"" style docu. The underlying films are chosen beautifully. And even though (I just read that) the picture quality is criticized by some insiders in the Amazon review section, I still find it very good. Especially for a DVD release.

Someone loved this project and one can feel it in every episode.

Since I am German I lack the vocabulary to express my feelings in more detail. But let me conclude: Were I an history teacher, I'd show these in class ;) Highly recommended.",1444176000,,939,4.742331288343558

The narration is excellent, though sometimes the documentary leaves out important information or otherwise glosses over a few events that the put the U.S. in a negative light. The overthrow of the Iranian Shah and the Contra Affair are examples. Despite these brief shortcomings it's an excellent work.

5045874,1,B00701QYIE,"First, full disclosure: I am a journalist who spent much of his career covering international relations. In the 1980s, I lived in Nicaragua, covering the civil wars in Central America, and was very much touched personally by everything around Cuba, since I was born there.

Further, I worked at CNN for more than two decades.

And I worked on this documentary series: I produced the Spanish language version that aired on CNN en Espaol.

I think Ted Turner gave the world a wonderful gift in financing this endeavour, at a (reported) cost of $1 million/episode (in mid-1990's U.S. dollars). He did also by having it as a co-production with the BBC and by having a team of the most prestigious  documentary producers, writers and researchers in the English-speaking world take on the job. It is branded as a CNN documentary, but nobody involved in day-to-day CNN operations was centrally involved, to the best of my knowledge.

The one person who was heavily involved for months in this project, and who came from, and went back to, day-to-day CNN news coverage was me; but apart from helping with one or another translation in the original English version, my involvement was only in taking into Spanish a documentary that had already been completed and broadcast in English.

So why do I give this wonderful series one star?

Because I think this edition is an abomination.

The historical footage that took years to unearth and restore has been bowdlerized, altered, re-cropped to have the image fully fill a 16X9 TV widescreen instead of preserving the original 4:3 or other ""boxy"" aspect ratios, as the original series that aired on CNN, the BBC, and many, many other networks around the world had done.

This kind of change in a documentary of this type is a CRIME.

It deprives the audience of the genuine images created during the actual events for what some fly-by-night employee or intern decided would be included. It *automatically* calls into question the integrity of a project whose calling card must be, first and foremost, integrity.

And it sacrifices this integrity on the supposition that someone wanting to see the series would prefer not to be reminded that aspect ratios used to be different.

Well, if that is to be done, why not colorize the footage? True, a rose-cheeked FDR in a meeting of the Big Three might have seemed anomalous, seeing as he was practically in his death bed, but what's more important, journalistic integrity or good TV?

The POINT to a documentary like this is its historical genuineness, its accuracy, its integrity in presenting historical records, not how comfortable it feels to someone who (perhaps by mistake) stumbles upon it in the middle of TBS's Adult Swim.

I am certain if Ted Turner were still in charge of the companies that  bear his name, no matter what the cost, these DVD's would be pulled from the market, the original version of the series restored, and those who bought the falsified version offered the genuine version as a free replacement.",1401062400,14,3011,4.876470588235295

5045885,5,B00701QYIE,"The documentary is outstanding.  It contains many film clips that I have never seen.  The writing and organization are also excellent.  At this point, I have made it half way through the series and found only a few areas that need revision.  Some of this is probably due to the release of documents since the series was created.  At one point, the narrator mentions all the Americans who went to the Soviet Union in the 20s and 30s, saying that unlike the Russians they could return home.  This was not true in many cases.  See the book The Forsaken.  The section on the Rosenbergs also needs updated.  And finally, the McCarthy red-baiting episode is a bit one-sided.  Despite Senator McCarty's abhorent conduct, there were indeed many Communist spies at Los Alamos and in Hollywood and Washington, D.C.",1386892800,2,804,4.802919708029197

For me, having grown up with the Cold War, there are still things that I remember with fear or anger that I would not respond emotionally to if I were looking at material from the nineteenth century.  For me, having grown up in the 60s, for some reason, even now in the 21st century, when the subject of the military or space comes up, I find myself lapsing into old habits and referring to the Russians as Soviets.

This presentation is a balanced representation of the events, not particularly biased toward either side.

5045889,5,B00701QYIE,"""Cold War"" is mostly superb analysis and history of the major issues of the Cold War between the West and the Communist powers.  Having lived through most of this period I thought that I was pretty knowledgeable about most of the major issues presented here, and I was hugely surprised at how much I learned from this series (and how much I had not known).  Since this series was done by CNN I had my doubts about its objectivity, but mostly I believe that the analysis here is spot-on.  There are a few exceptions.  One episode of the series seems to draw a false equivalence between the Soviet Gulag system on the one hand, and America's ""McCarthy Era"" of anti-communist hysteria.  This is, of course, rubbish -- one imprisoned millions of innocent citizens while the other involved really only a small number of people suffering injustice, largely not affecting the average American citizen much or at all (which does not, of course, make it right).  Setting this anomaly aside, this series is largely brilliant.  Now that the old Soviet Union is no more, many of the commentators are former Soviet military and political figures who appear to be speaking quite candidly and with apparent truthfulness.  For example, who knew that the KGB was never told that the Soviet military was deploying IRBMs in Eastern Europe until it discovered this by its usual means of espionage?  The Soviet officials portray this deployment as an out-of-control military-industrial complex that just kept ""running the conveyor"" of missile production and deployment that for a long time no one in the Soviet government could stop.  (This had the effect of motivating America to deploy Pershing II IRBMs in Germany which were capable of striking Russian targets; that led to very significant arms reductions down the road).  This series presents many other equally fascinating insights.  The nature of the Sino-Soviet disputes is truly analyzed here.  Far from being a monolith, the Communist leaders are seen to be human beings engaged in power struggles, nationalist rivalry, and very human interpersonal rivalries.

Anyone who is interested in the Cold War and the history of the struggle between the West and Communism will find this series to be an amazing and rewarding viewing experience.  Most will view this series many times.  This is a terrific value.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1379203200,3,2370,5.033333333333333

In twenty-four episodes, each major event that took place during the Cold War is examined. From the diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. and to the military conflicts from Korea, to Vietnam, and Afghanistan. In addition to the history, many people that were directly involved in Cold War events are interviewed. These include military personnel, politicians, diplomats, activists, and others.

5045893,5,B00701QYIE,"The Marshall Plan was a plan for America to give aid to Europe after World War II in order to help them rebuild their economy and to stop the spread of Communism from the Soviet Union to the rest of Europe. Secretary of State George Marshall proposed the idea of American aid to Western Europe during a speech he made at Harvard University in June of 1947.  President Truman then sent the proposal on to Congress, and in April of 1948 the Economic Cooperation Act was passed. Over the following four years over $13 billion was given to all European countries who joined the Organization of European Economic Cooperation. The US also attempted to give aid to Soviet Satellite states, but Stalin refused to accept the offer. The main goals of the Marshall Plan were to give economic support to war torn countries of Europe to help them rebuild their economy totally, as well as increase productivity, and to create a trade market for American goods by removing trade barriers so that more trade could take place, in order for their economy to grow and prosper. The US also helped Europe rebuild themselves in social and political aspects as well. They provided Eastern Europe with food and water to relieve famine as well as coal and fuel to help with power shortages. The people of Eastern Europe were worn torn and impoverished, so this social build up was necessary before they could even begin to reconstruct the economy. Of course the political aspect of the entire Marshall Plan pretty much outweighed all others because the overall reason for it was to go along with Truman's containment policy and stop the spread of Communism from the Soviet Union. The plan supported Western Europe's development of a stable democratic government and helped the US to build stronger political ties between the two. When the funding from America was finally coming to an end in 1952, 4 years after it had begun, the several Western European nations involved in the Marshall Plan had succeeded in their economic growth and even exceeded their pre-war economies. These Western European countries continued to grow and prosper for the next two decades because of the help they were provided through the Marshall Plan, without American assistance it is almost certain that they would have fallen to Communism or if not at least into a severe economic depression.

 In this episode of CNN's Cold War, the post war devastation was depicted better than any textbook could have written it. Of course now we all know what the Marshall Plan did, but it was interesting to see why it was put into place. This episode not only went into every detail of the Marshall Plan, but also showed the famine and poverty that existed in Western Europe at the time, which caused the plan to be proposed. The episode shows whole families and even just children waiting in bread lines to try to get their next meal. This episode did not exclusively discuss the Marshall Plan, but also went into detail about Truman's Doctrine, which is very closely related. Truman's Doctrine was a proposal by President Truman to give $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey in order for them to avoid falling in the Soviet sphere of Communism. Before watching this episode I had no idea that Truman never actually mentioned the Soviet Union in his Doctrine, but it was clearly at the center of his ideas. The episode talked about the different spies that were used on both sides during the Cold War. The video also showed many details about Stalin as a leader. Stalin was offered aid through the Marshall Plan as well, but refused to accept it. Stalin knew that Germany's economic had taken a huge hit, and he was happy about it. He wanted Germany to stay down because he feared Germany. Stalin was a power crazed leader, he instructed Communism in the West in order to seize power. Stalin was reaching for Communist power in the Czechoslovakia and the US recognized his far reach and feared the ""Domino Theory."" The Domino Theory was the fear that as soon as one nation fell to Communism the rest of them would fall as well and there would be no stopping it. This fear of the Domino Theory was one of the driving factors of the Marshall Plan. The video said that the money given from the US to the various European nations was 20% loans and 80% grants, so they were not expected for these nations to pay back very much. Americans believed that spending money would fight Communism. The US relied on European success. If the nations they were giving aid to were to collapse, the US would have lost more money in the process than they had spent all together on the Marshall Plan. The episode included several different primary sources including students, Truman's aides, and Soviet intelligence. These different first hand accounts all had a unique look into the issue. Truman's aide had behind the scenes knowledge of how Truman felt about the Marshall plan and how he was banking on the success of the European economy. The Soviet intelligence explained the attitudes and tactics of Stalin, showing how much he feared Germany and his desire to spread his sphere of Communism as far as he possibly could. This episode of CNN Cold War gave an insiders look at the Marshall Plan and post war Europe, not just the facts that you may read in a book or online. I would recommend this episode to anyone looking to expand their knowledge on the Marshall Plan and the years following World War II in Western Europe.

5045894,5,B00701QYIE,"The Marshall Plan, announced by Secretary of State George C. Marshall in June 1947, was an essential part of America's containment policy. President Truman signed it in April 1948, officially beginning the plan to provide economic assistance to all European nations that were willing to join in drafting a program for recovery. Predictably, the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies rejected it. A total of sixteen Western European nations participated, including Germany. The Economic Cooperation Administration was an agency that was created to administer the Marshall Plan and it channeled about $13 billion in grants and loans to the participating Western European Nations. There were multiple motives behind the Marshall Plan: the genuine concern for the European people, the fear that Europe would remain an economic drain to America if it wasn't able to rebuild and support itself, a market for American goods and a trading partner, and to strengthen the pro-Western European governments so they would not fall to communism. The Marshall Plan was successful for both America and the sixteen participating Western European nations. It helped stabilize the capitalist economies of Western Europe and helped spark an economic revival. From 1948 to 1952, Western European economies grew at a remarkable rate. By the end of 1950, their industrial production had increased by 64%. All of this in turn benefited America as well with a revived trade with Western Europe and new markets for American goods and surpluses. Most importantly of all, it strengthened those nations enough to keep communist threats out and decreased communist support in those nations themselves.
 Episode 3 of this Cold War series is a very interesting documentary of the Marshall Plan. It shows many different points of views in interviews with people who were actually affected by the Marshall Plan. It shows why many people in Europe were attracted to Communism in the first place. After World War 2 and all the destruction it had caused, people were living in a struggle to survive. A student in Paris said, ""communism gave hope that it was possible to create a classless society, many people believed that communism was going to create a better world, better than the one that existed before the war."" Before watching this documentary, I had no idea of how bad the conditions were in Europe. It shows excellent primary footage of the destruction and poverty with people waiting in bread lines. It makes it clear that without the Marshall Plan those 16 Western European nations would have most likely fallen to communism. It shows that once those nations accepted the Marshall plan, the western alliance began to take shape, drawing the line of the cold war. It shows the reasons why the Soviet Union rejected it, which was that they saw it as an aggressive act, as if America was trying to impose their influence over the countries that accepted the Marshall aid while it also shows the American perspective that they were just trying to help out their former allies. It shows the process of getting the Marshall Plan approved with the isolationists finally giving in after Czechoslovakia came under Communism. After being threatened by Stalin, the Czechs rejected the Marshall plan which they were originally going to accept. In an interview Antonin Sum from Czechoslovakia says that as Gottwald got off the plane in his return from Moscow, he said, ""I went to Moscow as a prime minster of a free state and I am returning as Stalin's slave."" It shows a lot of footage of Americans going out to help administer the plan along with interviews with those who went out to help, and how it benefited the participating the nations. It shows how in Greece, Americans brought over Mules that were much larger and stronger than the mules they had before and how they adjusted to the changes. It also includes speeches from the pope in Italy, excommunicating communists, accusing them of being atheists. The documentary contains a lot of interesting content with different perspectives and some random things that are still interesting such as the mules in Greece. I am not a huge history person but found this to be interesting with a lot of good information, which is why I am giving it five stars.",1365724800,,4279,5.018284106891702
5045895,5,B00701QYIE,"Concerned that the Cold War would slip into history, ignored and forgotten, Ted Turner hired 'World at War' producer Jeremy Isaacs to create a similar documentary about the conflict.  He succeeded in fine style - using the same narrative techniques as before.  As the box says: ""A massive three-year effort.... team shot more than 1000 hours of original footage and screened 1500 hours of archival film material.... travelled to 31 countries and conducted more than 500 interviews, many with key players at the time who rarely go before the cameras.""  My guess is that those interviewed knew this would be their last and best chance to state their case.

Is 'The Cold War' perfect?  No -  but it's close enough for me.  I realize that not everyone has the time to watch 18.7 hours on the subject.  In 6 disks with 4 chapters apiece, a lot of time is covered -  from the end of World War I and the Russian Revolution up to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  As with 'World at War', the producers do not follow an exact linear timeline.  Instead, they explore different topics in detail - with frequent overlaps in time periods, geography and personalities.  They interview policy makers and regular folks on all sides -  I say all sides because there were many sides to the Cold War and many interpretations, depending on who's doing the talking.  In a careful combination of interviews, historical footage, sound and silence, they convey the emotional reality of events and what people were thinking, why they believed they were right, what they feared and what they hoped to achieve.

I won't provide a precis of each chapter or a list of interviews (get the program for that).  However, here are a few things that left a lingering impression:

-  The poverty and desperation of defeated or oppressed nations, which are beyond the comprehension of most Americans.
-  The selfishness and shortsighted bungling of the European powers after WW1 equaled anything you might find in Iraq or Afghanistan today.  They were not up to the aspirations that Woodrow Wilson had for them.
-  Without the quick infusion of Marshall Plan money and aggressive CIA meddling, Greece and Italy would probably have gone communist and become East Bloc satellites.
-  I didn't know much about the joint efforts of the Vatican and the CIA in tilting Italian elections.  This was mirrored 4 decades later in the cooperation of Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II in toppling the Jaruzelski regime in Poland.
-  The successful occupations of Germany and Japan are surely among our country's greatest achievements.  The world's 2 most destructive nations were transformed into prosperous and stable societies.
-  If you think spies have guilt or remorse for their treachery, think again:  Kim Philby went to his grave a loyal servant of the KGB; Aldrich Ames is sorry he got caught.
-  It's worth noting that most US traitors turned sides for a banal reason: money.
-  The Hungarian rebellion of 1956 has echoes in today's Syria.  Oppressed people fight for freedom and sheer physical survival; western nations cheer from the sidelines and salute them - but offer no direct aid.  They have their reasons: the US was not going to risk a nuclear war over Hungary - just as it is not going to risk a direct war with Iran today.
-  The series offers deeper understanding of the Cuban missile crisis.  Today, it is portrayed as a colossal blunder by Khrushchev and a brilliant feat of statecraft by Kennedy.  In reality, it was a high-speed collision of 3 ambitious men: Khrushchev, Kennedy and Castro.  All 3 played a role in creating the crisis; 2 of them (JFK and Khrushchev) defused it; Castro was left out in the cold, furious that his loyalty to the Soviets left him with little to show for it.
-  It's not wise to get complacent and think we can predict the future: 1 year after the crisis, Kennedy was dead; 2 years after, Khrushchev was tossed out of power.  Today, 51 years later, Castro is still alive, with his government intact, enjoying a comfortable seaside retirement.
-  The Cold War ended without the firing of a single nuclear weapon.
-  However, it was not 'won' for free.  At the very end, Isaacs wraps it up exactly as I knew he would: with a sober accounting of the Cold War's cost in human lives (millions of deaths - mostly civilian - in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan; hundreds of thousands in Africa and South America),  trillions of dollars, shattered hopes and lost opportunities.

Some of the interviews are too short.  There's no way around this, really.  If everyone was given adequate time, the result would be a 600-hour TV show - which would not get a lot of viewers.  I see that this program has garnered only 28 Amazon reviews.  I hope it will find its way into high school and junior college curricula.",1365465600,4,4812,4.7295673076923075
5045896,5,B00701QYIE,"Do not equate this production with the CNN you may or may not watch today. This is a first-class, let's say PBS/BBC-type documentary first shown on CNN in the early 90s on successive Sunday evenings. I have never seen any documentary on CNN of this caliber before or after. It is detailed, objective, and features a cast of witnesses that you will never find assembled again from both sides of the iron curtain. I assume back then CNN stood for something so people were willing to sit down and talk. The series does not rely on pictures alone, does not re-enact historic situations with actors, and does not rely on platitudes and one-liners. At the same time it never gets boring. I have yet to find anything of equal quality when it comes to a documentary of the Cold War. We watched the original on TV, got the VHS tapes, and always hoped one day it would come out on DVD.

I have an extensive biographical library of leaders of the 20th Century and found this series reasonably balanced with revealing and fascinating interviews of former (and current) major players from both sides of the Cold War ideological divide.

Even though produced in the late 90s, I felt this series was still very relevant.  Very accessible, non-history buffs can easily draw the line between how the conduct of U.S. foreign policy in the late Cold War, bore bitter fruit for the 21st century in the ongoing global crisis between fundamentalist Islam and the West.

The doccie doesn't focus on over the top reconstructions of the events.

5045902,5,B00701QYIE,"This collection was created by Ted Turner's CNN at the height of their organization as a media company. It was headed by the historical direction of the post-revisionist historian John Lewis Gaddis. When the series originally came out it was met with criticism on both sides for being too pro-USA or pro-USSR. However Gaddis was selected because of his ability to consider both sides of the conflict (I would also recommend Gaddis' book The Long Peace or, more recently,The Cold War). The big thing that is missing from this collection is the additional materials presented on the CNN website when the collection was originally aired. the website can be found with some deep searching on archival sites. The site contained educator guides for all 24 episodes including suggested activities, primary source documents, important figures and interviewees' backgrounds, guiding questions for every section, and more. I was eagerly hoping that some of this would be included but the DVD series does not even have the intview with Gaddis (it does have the full interview with Fidel Castro). Overall it is a must have for educators, historians, and those interested in learning about the significance of the Cold War, but hopefully it will be improved with later releases that contain the wealth of resource that we originally intended to go with the videos.",1361577600,6,1351,5.117647058823529

In fact if I did not know better I would have thought this was a continuation of the eariler series. The footage is great and the many interviews with the people who were part of the Cold War are fantastic.

5045904,5,B00701QYIE,"CNN production 1998. 6 discs, 24 episodes about 45 min each. Though no single book or documentary could cover the events of the cold war in all it's aspects, this series does a good job. Its not radically biased even though it has a certain perspective of historical events. Unnecesary to further explain perhaps for contemporary audiences of 1998 since they already had a fuller context. But for those who have no memory of the cold war, they may watch this and wonder what all the fuss was about. There isn't much description of the idealogical differences between societies and explaining the cold war as hostility carried out on all levels: political, economic, cultural, technological, spiritual, philosophical, and personal.
In places it can be too soft, or non judgmental, on the evil means and ends of communism. We should never allow ourselves to lose sight of the 100,000,000 people killed under communist totalitarianism worldwide. Nowhere in this documentary does it state the true dimensions of the Red scourge, which is a gross omission. Perhaps it was avoided in order to get the many interviews with key communist figures and the rather genteel class of diplomats all around.

This is, without question, the documentary series to watch if you want to learn about the Cold War.  It is packed full of interviews with men and women who made history -- politicians and policymakers, diplomats and dissidents, soldiers and spies, advisors and activists -- as well as with men and women who simply lived through that history and are willing to share their experiences of what life was like for ordinary people during the time of the Cold War.  Each episode is packed full of the best available film footage of the events being covered; and the story behind those events is told in clear and concise terms by narrator Kenneth Branagh (the noted Shakespearian actor and film director).  I can't even imagine a better, or more thorough treatment of the history of the Cold War.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this documentary series to students, teachers, and anyone who wants to learn more about this fascinating period in world history.  I should also note that this 6 disc DVD set comes with two bonus features: On disc 5 is an excellent extended interview with Fidel Castro, which focuses mainly on the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and which is well worth watching; and on disc 6 is an old, rather hokey, anticommunist propaganda film from 1952, which does a great job of illustrating how Americans saw the ""Red Menace"" back in the early days of the Cold War.

As a former Foreign Service Officer who served in some Cold War countries, I am amazed at how much I have learned from this series. I find it especially credible because only participants in the Cold War on all sides share their insights, some of which I find stunning.
Personally I can attest that the vignettes on Chile and Angola are 'spot on.' The episodes on the Hungarian uprising and the subsequent disinterment of executed premier Imry Nagy still bring tears to my eyes. The interviews with Beria's son, who was responsible for bugging FDR's residence at Yalta and providing the transcripts to Stalin every morning, underscored that Stalin never played by the rules of Queensbury.
Over all, I found the series even-balanced and broad ranging. Howver, I did feel that the portrayal of McCarthyism and the Rosenbergs was not evenly balanced with the murder and gulags that were commonplace in the Soviet Union. In part, perhaps, this was because virtually no graphic film was available on these Soviet shenanigans.
I have watched the entire series perhaps ten times and discover (or re-discover) surprising aspects of the Cold War on each viewing. For someone who lived throughout this period, and, especially, for teachers and students for whom the Cold War is as inexplicable as was World War I was to me, this is a must see. I also strongly recommend the companion COLD WAR book, which covers the same material in a less vivid manner. I strongly advise that you see the video---and then see it again.

8507436,5,B00701QYIE,"My online review from 2012:

Cold War, a joint production between the BBC and the Turner Broadcasting System, is a 24-episode series that aired on CNN in 1998. It begins with a brief look at Soviet and U.S. relations between the first and second World Wars, then follows the stormy history of the two powers from the end of WWII to the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in 1991. Each episode examines an aspect of the cold war such as MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), the Space Race, or the Star Wars program -- with much commentary from participants on both sides. Several episodes are also devoted to an analysis of the major wars of the era that Americans fought in Korea and Vietnam, and the Russians in Afghanistan.

There are a staggering number of interviews from presidents, cabinet members, prime ministers, peasants, foot soldiers, average citizens, military brass, Stasi and CIA agents, and many more, complemented by a vast collection of archival film. The narration is read by Kenneth Branagh, who maintains a professionally neutral tone throughout.

Each 45-minute installment begins with a quick introduction to the subject at hand, followed by a short intro, before jumping into the episode proper. The series creators expertly handle the unavoidable Tower of Babel that results from the many non-English speakers by beginning each interview with the speaker's voice in his or her native language, which is then lowered in volume and replaced with a translator's voice-over. English SDH subtitles are also provided.

Special Feature: The Hoaxters (Cautionary cold war-era propaganda documentary)

The Cold War slipcase cover art is a colorful faux-woodcut of John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. JFK, behind a podium with his hand slightly raised as though making an important point, appears reasonable and statesman-like, while Khrushchev, with his wide open mouth and upraised fist, might as well have a cartoon balloon floating over his head that reads, ""We will bury you!"" A bank of red missiles looms in the background, sprouting from the Soviet flag and partially covering the stars on the American flag. Fortunately for the viewer, the series is not as unbalanced as the cover might lead one to believe, but the documentary's outlook is indeed America-centric. The episode, Conclusions, for instance, takes on a rather triumphalist tone with a beaming Bush the Elder crowing over the 1991 Christmas Day dissolution of the Soviet Republic. The underlying implication seems to be that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. were equally culpable for the arms buildup and the belligerent nuclear standoff.

Yet, earlier episodes in the series present enough facts to muster up a strong argument for America's desire to continue and escalate the cold war. The CIA receives considerable criticism for its covert ""low-level war"" atrocities in Guatemala, Cuba, and Chile (the CIA was always eager to spring into action when the leader of a sovereign nation began to speak openly about nationalizing local industries.) More tellingly, thanks to a Soviet economy that was collapsing under the weight of its heavy defense spending, Gorbachev was ready to scrap all of the country's nuclear devices in a one-to-one deal with the US, but Reagan adamantly refused to terminate the absurd Strategic Defense Initiative (aka the Star Wars program, roundly criticized by most scientists), and thereby scuttled the deal.

A later episode points out that Soviet Russia was not a monolithic entity, but a precarious conglomeration of 15 republics and a handful of satellite countries. On the other hand, the USA -- a vastly richer and more stable country, not bordered by any hostile nations -- found it in their interest to protect the world from communism by undermining democratically elected leaders and backing non-communist, dictatorial regimes around the world. On the Soviet side of the ledger, there is no doubt that Stalin was a homicidal egomaniac. During his 30-year reign he established gulags and had hundreds of thousands of innocents executed, but it's clear from this series-- even with its capitalistic bias --  that America's leaders were less motivated by ideology than imperialistic ambitions. The decades-long cold war was a conflict generally framed by politicians and the media as the clash of capitalist and communist ideologies, but in fact was more often about servicing giant corporations, acquisition of territories, and empire building. The series concludes with a supposedly happy ending as the Soviet Republic vanishes, but I'm not so sure about that. Fourteen years after the series aired, the backwash of the cold war is still very much with us.

The history of the cold war is a vast landscape of Machiavellian intrigue, wars of aggression, and cynical manipulation of politics for shadowy ends, all loosely wrapped in high-toned patriotic homilies. We can only be grateful that our great leaders, mostly through sheer luck, did not enshroud the earth in a nuclear fire. Regretfully, with the huge cache of nuclear bombs and missiles left in the wake of cold war hostilities, ongoing servitude to the arms industry, lack of political will to destroy those weapons, and an overabundance of saber-rattling politicians, there is still ample opportunity for a third world war.

The new DVD set includes only two extras: Hoaxters (36:06), a polished but intellectually crude propaganda film from 1952 that compares communists and socialists to snake-oil salesman, and an interview with Fidel Castro, Castro In His Own Words, in which he pontificates on the Cuban Missile Crises of 1962. I know it would have been too much to ask, but a follow-up episode bringing us up to date on cold war after-effects would have been a wonderful inclusion.

Picture quality varies in accordance with the condition of the archival material. The archival clips vary from fairly beat-up to quite nice, with an average amount of dirt and debris present. All the interviews filmed for the series are sharp and well-lighted. The 1.78:1 anamorphic picture fits perfectly on a 16:9 display (no black bars), and is an overall pleasing image. The DVD case states the audio is Dolby Digital Stereo, but try as I might, I only hear monophonic. In any case, the sound is perfectly acceptable for a documentary-style series. The sound of the old newscasts is often clipped and full of hiss, but the modern footage -- interviewees and narrator -- is crisp and intelligible.

Because I lived through much of the era, the 18-hour documentary was something of an emotional roller coaster ride for me, dredging up memories I had not revisited in decades. I recalled listening intently for the Sputnik's beep on a crystal radio set, doing the nuclear bomb ""duck and cover"" drill in grade-school, watching the black-and-white TV broadcast of Kennedy's Cuban Missile Crisis speech, and marching in anti-war rallies. However, it's not necessary to have come of age during the fifties and sixties to enjoy the series. It's the deepest, most comprehensive coverage of cold war history aired on TV, and not likely to be equaled anytime soon.  Along with a few good books on the subject and at least one viewing of Dr. Strangelove, watching Cold War is a fine way to get acquainted with mid-to-late 20th century realpolitik.",1486512000,,8063,5.21097372488408
