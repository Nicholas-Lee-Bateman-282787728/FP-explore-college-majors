The video is intense, seeing the live reactions and interpretations of the band member's visit to The Holy Land is an experience every music aficionado ought to have.  ESPECIALLY if you ""feel"" it (reggae music)",1361491200,,313,4.777777777777778
7945456,5,B00005MEW2,"Israel vibration is one of the greatest reggae harmony groups of all time and still makes unsurpassed reggae, even as the trio has splintered off into single or duo efforts. They carry along what is best in the originally inspired reggae of Bob Marley and others and bring it into our present hip-hop dance hall era without any of those influences - so just expect roots grooves of astonishing variety and creativity from them. This dvd has a lot of concert footage, but generally the songs are truncated so as to cut to interviews or filming of their visit to the ""Holy Land"" - Israel itself. The musical skill and joi de voivre of these three polio-stricken mystical voices of reggae music presents a great picture of them and their glee to be alive and making great music.",1110153600,4,775,4.6231884057971016
