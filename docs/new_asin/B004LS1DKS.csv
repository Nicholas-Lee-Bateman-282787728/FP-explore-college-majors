8434766,5,B004LS1DKS,U.B.O.S. was a short lived series due to infringement rights which was bad for a lot of us who loved the series. I was glad I could find the complete series so my son and I could enjoy it again.,1360195200,2,194,3.875
8434767,5,B004LS1DKS,"My kids of 5 & 8 love this TV series.  They finish the whole DVD on the weekend.  They were into it that we have to force them to turn off tv to bed.  I watched a few episodes and I was into it as well.  It is full of magics and fun, great stories too.",1335312000,3,252,3.4464285714285716
