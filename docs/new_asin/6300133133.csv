208426,3,6300133133,"This Spanish horror film from 1973 shows a lot of promise but fails to deliver the type of movie experience one would expect on the basis of its title.  For a number of reasons, I was quite unable to really connect with the story and found myself rather bored at times as the movie progressed.  There's just no atmosphere at all here; I don't care about the characters or what happens to them because they simply do not seem real.  Our story begins in 15th century France with the execution of a warlock and his mistress.  After being called every name in the book (warlock, demon, vampire, Satan worshipper, etc.), the warlock curses his killers just before his head is divorced from his body.  His vow to return has to wait four centuries to be realized.  Paul, Maurice, and their best girls attend a s&eacute;ance, and Paul asks the medium where he can find the reputed warlock's head and body (which are supposedly buried somewhere on his property).  The four friends decide to test the medium's power by searching for the remains in the locations she indicates, so they journey deep into the woods to a remote chalet.  The group somehow grows to six people at some point thereabouts, and some pretty bad things begin to happen after a buried chest is discovered.  This chest, of course, contains the head of the long-dead warlock, and he soon begins resuming his old ways of making people do his bidding by starting intently at them.  Zombies emerge from a swamp, and the housemates in the chalet begin to disappear or fall under the evil influence one by one.  Once the warlock gets his feet back under him (literally), he starts popping up everywhere to seduce or kill people.  Even though our list of heroes declines steadily over the course of the film, the whole thing gets rather tedious.  The bad guys stare at people, and the resulting zombies shamble around aimlessly for the most part.  The warlock just isn't evil enough for me to love to hate, and the characters are all pretty expendable in my book.
One serious problem I see with this movie is its annoying tendency to jump around constantly; a scene might start in one place and magically end in another.  This allows for no flow whatsoever.  Then you have the dubbing into English, which is flat, uninvolved, and thus a liability.  There are also logical inconsistencies spread far and wide; the movie can tell you one thing and then disprove its own argument the next.  It can't even decide what type of horror movie it wants to be; instead, it draws on any number of genres and themes and tries to force all of them together, hoping this will help make up for the warlock's boring ineffectiveness.  There are a lot of little things that bugged me too; e.g., the group arrives at the chalet without enough gas to make their trip home and thus cannot run away when bad things start happening; the warlock magically pushes a door open and then materializes in the room, thereby making the act of his opening the door inane; and he also seems to forget he can dematerialize at will, an affliction that bodes an exceedingly tiresome doom.
But what about the gore this movie is reported to showcase?  The goriness of Horror Rises From the Tomb is vastly overstated in my opinion; surely, a few people die at the hands of sharp implements, and several heads are lost in the process, but we don't see much blood at all.  The disembodied heads also look quite unreal to my eyes.  I would consider this movie rather tame indeed in the blood and guts department.  In essence, this movie wanders around in circles, unsuccessfully trying to discover an identity for itself.  As such, it never manages to draw the viewer into the story and thus winds up as yet another forgettable horror film from days gone by.",1045612800,2,3770,4.626126126126126
208427,3,6300133133,"""Horror Rises From the Tomb"" (""El Espanto surge de la tumba"") begins with a prologue in 15th century France, when a knight is beheaded for being a warlock. Five hundred years later the head is dug up, comes back to life, starts possessing people, and uses them to do all sorts of horrible things like ritualistic sacrifices, not to mention searching for the rest of his body. This 1973 Spanish splatter flick comes from first-time director Carlos Aured, who does little besides point the camera in the right direction. The gore level is certainly well above average, especially for the time period, in terms of decapitations and disembowelments, but that is pretty much all ""Horror Rises From the Tomb"" has to recommend itself. The only other attraction here is cult actor Paul Naschy (a.k.a. Jacinto Molina, Paul Mackey, so on and so forth) who plays not just Ulric du Marnac, but Hugo du Marnac and Armand du Marnac.  Although he had bit parts in films like ""King of Kings"" and ""55 Days at Peking,"" Naschy was more at home in cheap horror films such as ""The Werewolf's Shadow"" and ""Curse of the Devil"" (to limit the discussion to films still available). He certainly has more presence than anybody else in this film. The plot is negligle, but, gee, burying the warlock's head on the own estate seems like such a really big mistake now, does it not?.  This film is dubbed into English and gets three stars because it does deliver on the gore you would expected from a low-budget European horror film and because two stars are reserved for bad movies that are also stupid, while one star would be for truly wretched horror films on a par with snuff films.",1037577600,,1655,4.664383561643835

Not even for funs looking for a good horror film among other types of movies. This is a good representative of Spanish B horror, with lots of nudity and very RED blood all over the place.

208433,5,6300133133,"HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB (HRFTT, from here on out) is one of Paul Naschy's superb entries in European horror. It is a totally, 100% unique brew that was created in a feverish night of speed and no sleep...and it does indeed show! Naschy, known more for his Waldemar Daninsky werewolf pictures, creates another iconic character that has more in common with the classic Universal horror film of the 30s and 40s than with other Euro-horror films of the era (the 70s). No, there are no black-gloved mysterious killers stalking women through Italian (or, in this case, Spanish) streets. Here in HRFTT is a Alaric du Marnac, a warlock who dabbles in a bit of this and that (vampirism, black magic, necromancy, cannibalism, etc) who was influenced by the real Frenchman, Gilles de Rais -- a purported child murderer and who knows what else for sure. Truly, du Marnac is about as evil of a character you will ever find in any horror film of the last 50 years; no sense of conscience, he exists purely for the seeking of pleasure for himself and his mistress, Mabille du Lancre (played by the beautiful Helga Line). Naschy plays du Marnac with such sincerity and charisma, he seems to have channelled the magic of Karloff, Lugosi and Chaney while still making this character his own. The other actors should be commended as well, including Line, Emma Cohen and Vic Winner; all give superb performances for what many might just write off as another cheesy Euro-exploitation movie.

I don't want to give away too much about the film itself, since it really is unique. But, I will say this film involves just about every evil, dark thing imaginable -- thanks to Naschy's fevered mind during the creation of the script. You'll see everything from plain old carjackings all the way up to the living dead to odd colors to mist floating around so many scenes, not to mention the evil-doings du Marnac was known for.

The print used by BCI/Deimos is incredible. It blows away all other versions ever seen, probably even theatrically speaking. The colors blaze out of the screen, the details are so crisp it truly is amazing. The sound is lovely too; the score is very unique, almost like an organ score from an older silent film (though, more experimental). It features two language tracks (Eng & Span) plus a wonderful commentary track from Paul Naschy and Carlos Aured. The extras are various as well -- trailers, alternate scenes, stills, and insightful linernotes written by Mirek Lipinski.

This entire line of BCI/Deimos' Naschy & Spanish releases really raise the bar for Euro-horror releases. BCI/Deimos should be awarded honors for taking these films seriously and giving them the royal treatment.",1200614400,4,2691,4.85838779956427
208434,2,6300133133,"It has been widely reported that Naschy took but a week to turn in his script for this badly contrived horror piece.  It shows.  Though the central idea of an evil warlock and his accomplice rising from the dead to wreak their vengeance isn't bad (though hardly original), the resulting screenplay is a travesty of badly pieced together ideas.  It starts with two ""swinging couples"" choosing an old family castle for a getaway and progresses from there VERY slowly to the reincarnation of the evil warlock.  Things pick up quite a bit from this point, but they also get more convoluted with the head warlock and his accomplice hypnotizing the humans in the cast to basically kill each other.  Zombies make their appearance late in the game, completely arbitrarily, and their actions have little to do with the main ""plot"".  I am a Naschy fan, but have to admit to being very disappointed with this mishmash.  The few good points to this include the frequent nudity of the admittedly beautiful women in the cast and outstanding color photography.  Extras on the disk are nothing special and include but a very brief, hammy, and not very entertaining introduction from Naschy.

If you want an introduction to Naschy's peculiar brand of Euro Horror, I suggest you start out with any of his werewolf vehicles here on Amazon.  The ones available from Anchor Bay Entertainment or BCI are all given first rate presentations.",1200355200,,1417,4.866666666666666
208435,3,6300133133,"The new BCI DVD of ""Horror Rises From The Tomb"" is a revelation. Fully uncut and in widescreen, the movie has never looked so good. Sadly, while it glows in the glory of stunning picture and sound, the film itself comes up a bit short. But that's not to say it isn't fun. The story involves a medieval warlock named Alaric and his lover who are executed and buried for their evil crimes. In the present day, two couples, one of whom is a descent of the original wizard, decide to search for the bodies and dig them up (for reasons I cannot quite remember), which of course leads to dire consequences for all.  What initially impressed me was the stunning prologue, beautifully filmed on a windswept plain somewhere, but this was immediately followed by a shift into the present day where two modern, beautiful, swinging couples spend far too long having dull conversations and generally wasting running time before the evil ancestor is finally dug up and (surprise, surprise) rejuvenated. Before the re-appearance of the warlock, the film sags miserably, so don't be surprised if you find your attention wandering. I have seen this film twice and on both occasions I lose interest in the film totally during this part.

Things get going again around the halfway mark and things benefit by the appearance of Naschy (again) as Alaric and the statuesque Helga Line as the revived mistress. But the film never really kicks into top gear, and I think this leaden first half is partly to blame. Paul Naschy does his best as usual but none of the four main characters are interesting, and the blonde woman in particular is an appallingly bad actress. And if you're expecting lots of gore filled action, you might be disappointed. A lot of the effects in the film are pretty bad, and many are just ""materializations"" or hypnosis scenes done with coloured lights.  There is a bit of gore, most notably an amazing scene in which Helga Line tears a man's chest open with her fingernails and pulls his heart out (!), and there are a few other fun bits, such as the return of some of the recently murdered victims as undead attackers. This had the potential to be a great highlight of the film, as the dead bodies seem to reside in a lake during the day and rise at night, and the make up for them is truly ghoulish. Unfortunately it's treated in a very throwaway fashion, and because the plot is so weak it doesn't really make that much sense, but at least the film is a bit more exciting during the short sequence when they attack a house. Proof that this scene is wasted is clear from the amount of promotional material that uses images of these zombies, in particular the girl on the cover of this BCI DVD cover - a gruesome sight that you'll sadly have trouble spotting clearly in the film itself

As the film plods onwards, too much time is spent on the warlock's rather dull ability to hypnotize some characters and make them his slaves. This is obviously a very cheap effect as they just have to walk around menacing each other blankly, although in the case of the hopeless blonde actress it's a positive bonus, as her performance improves immensely once she stops talking! There's also a very weak idea involving an amulet that can repel the evil wizard, and once this is found he switches rather drastically from indestructible to a complete pushover and the film winds up rather rapidly from this point onwards. For all these reasons I find the film ultimately rather unsatisfying, which disappointed me because having only the previously released poor copies of it, I thought the BCI version was going to reveal it's full glory, but it actually achieved the opposite and showed it up as a rather ineffective mish mash of different ideas. There are some great shots and images but the plot and script pretty much undermine all the good visual atmosphere.

The BCI version comes with both Spanish and English soundtracks, but the Spanish one sounds very tinny compared with the full bodied English one, so I stuck with that one, which of course never helps! There's also some bonus material in the form of a gallery and a great collection of alternate ""clothed"" sequences for a lot of shots, but the main feature itself contains the full nudity versions of all these scenes, so you won't have to feel you are missing anything with the main version! Plus it has that fantastic cover.",1197417600,16,4379,4.6597671410090555
208436,3,6300133133,"The Euro-horror films of the 70's fell into two distinct categories: those that were campy and scary and those that were just campy. Carlos Aured's Horror Rises From the Tomb falls squarely into the latter grouping, but like the finest of its kind this Tomb was wisely filled with plenty of cheap scares, bloody thrills, and gratuitous nudity.

A narrator tells us of the powerful warlock Alaric du Marnac (Paul Naschy )and his faithful mistress Mabille Du Lancre (Helga Line) and we witness their gruesome deaths in 15th century France. Before they are executed the demonic duo places a curse on the land and vow to return and wreak vengeance on the descendants of their persecutors. Present day appears and four rich socialites decide to use a medium to attempt to resurrect the evil sorcerer just for fun. Hugo (again Paul Naschy) and Maurice (Victor Barrera) are skeptical of the superstitions surrounding du Marnac's burial grounds but their wide-eyed girlfriends find plenty to fear. Intent on exposing their supposedly silly assumptions, Hugo insists the four take a trip up to the monastery where the dreaded warlock supposedly met his demise. Once there the group realizes too late the power of Alaric's wizardry and the reincarnated sorcerer will finally have his revenge.

The similarities between Alaric du Marnac and Dracula are shockingly abundant and appear only slightly altered to mask the obviously stolen traits. Both dress in gothic black garb complete with flowing capes. Both can control their victims with hypnotic powers to carry out their bidding, and both lust after blood (one prefers still-beating hearts to flowing veins however). If that wasn't evidence enough of du Marnac's borrowed legacy, the wicked wizard is also affected by a cross of sorts (here a necklace adorned with crossed hammers) and his mistress can be destroyed by a silver stake (with the bizarre requirements that the wielder be a girl with a pure soul).

While the story itself may be lacking in the originality department it really only serves as a catalyst for bouts of bloodletting and nudity. Far too often unnaturally fortunate coincidences arise and significant discoveries are made with too little effort. Little to no explanation is given for events and the characters' reactions to such ludicrous happenings, but ultimately realism is not a priority in such films. Gore is, and there are several notably unique scenes of carnage, and while they aren't as graphic as much of the imagery created today, they remain effective.

Combining a ridiculous mix of superstitions and mythology with primarily stereotypical scares, Aured still manages to overcome the low budget with a decent body count and a view of a few decent bodies. Vampires, zombies, sorcerers, pure souls, silver needles, ritualistic heart-ripping, good transitions, bad camera tricks, and a couple beheadings all make an appearance in Horror Rises From the Tomb, while reality keeps its distance. Hugo sums up the film best in a frantic warning, ""Anything can happen in this madness!""

208437,5,6300133133,"""Horror Rises From the Tomb"" is a 70s favorite that used to play heavily edited on Chicago TV.  The unrated version of the movie certainly came as a surprise!  The DVD includes three versions of the film:  the U.S. theatrical release, an uncut international release, and a ""clothed"" version.  The preferred version is the ""clothed"" one since it's presented in widescreen from a German DVD release, but you'll want to see the unrated one to see how much nudity was removed from the U.S. cut.

208439,5,6300133133,"First of all, I am the type of person that likes to view rare and obscure horror flicks, hence why I bought Horror Rises From the Tomb on a whim. I was totally surprised by the DVD when it arrived. First of all, its a two disc set with three versions of the movie! The first disc contains the international uncut version in Full Screen and a version called the ""Clothed"" version in Widescreen. The ""Clothed"" version is easily the best looking of the three version and looks really crisp for a 30+ year old relatively unknown film. Unlike the ""uncut"" version, the ""clothed"" version actually contains alternate sequences that have many of the nude women ""clothed"", and also contains some alternate edits to cut down on the nudity. The ""uncut"" international version contains all the gore and nudity, but the negative doesn't look near as good as the ""cloth"" version. It's still easily worth having. The second disc contains yet a third version of the film which is a full screen transfer fo the U.S. cut release. This is easily the worst as it cuts out all the nudity and gore and the negative looks absolutly terrible. There is also a slew of extras included on the second disc including still gallaries, trailers, and bios. All this came housed in a double keep case that slipped nicely in a cardboard slipcase. I was totally blown away that such an obscure film would get released so nicely on DVD, since more popular movies by bigger distributors usually are unleashed in bare bone releases. If your a fan of rare Euro horror flicks such as Tombs Of The Blind Dead and The Beyond, then you will not be disappointed by this DVD release. If Child's Play 3 and Freddy Vs. Jason are what you consider to be difinitive horror films, then Horror Rises From the Tomb won't be your cup of tea.",1098316800,13,1786,4.566978193146418

I just really wish they had put the real international version in widescreen, along with a great transfer, as opposed to doing that for a tamer and less true version of the film.  The good news is that there is now an international version with a dvd of it's own and an apparently great transfer.  It also has two audio tracks, unlike this one - which makes you suffer through overdubbing - which I think helps amp up the experience of watching a Spanish Horror Movie.
In regards to the film: it's certainly a piece of ""Euro-Shock"" history and an important piece of cinema (as far as I'm concerned).  While the acting may be bad, and the sets are often really poorly made, the truth is that there is a pure beauty in this type of film making and Horror Rises From the Tomb is able to come across as a great piece of art (whether it wants to or not, and whether most people are willing to admit it or not) that deserves to be watched.

  Naschy stars in a dual role; he is the Medieval warlock Alaric De Marnac who is beheaded and his ancestor Hugo De Marnac.  Hugo and his three friends travel to his ancestral home where they encounter superstitious peasants and vigilante justice.  Possessed by the spirits of Alaric, the friends unwittingly help the warlock and his priestess lover Mabille De Lancr to become flesh and blood.  Soon, throughout the sleepy mountain countryside and nearby village, throats are slashed and hearts are ripped from their chests as the two fiends satiate their hunger.  Hugo's one surviving friend, Maurice Roland, attempts to send Alaric and Mabille back to their graves before their power becomes unstoppable.

  There are lots of gory killings.  Unfortunately, the special effects could've been better.  It was obvious that latex rubber was being torn rather than flesh when the hearts were being ripped from their bodies.  The transformation of the skeleton into Mabille was extremely poor, and silly.

7802849,2,6300133133,"Horror Rises  from the Tomb (Carlos Aured, 1973)

Carlos Aured and Paul Naschy's fourth and final collaboration is roughly what one expects from a seventies horror film from Spain-- a jumbled mess that exists solely as a vehicle for basement-budget unrealistic gore effects and, at times, copious female nudity. None of which makes up for the meandering plot, the bad acting, the even worse dubbing (if there's a subtitled version of this, I've not managed to find it; the DVD, rented from Blockbuster Online, gave no options for changing audio language or providing subtitles), and all the myriad other problems with this film.

The main plot concerns a fifteenth-century warlock, Alaric de Marnac (Naschy), who, along with his assistant/lover Elvira (Emma Cohen), is killed by the inquisition. Fast-forward to present day, when de Marnac's descendant Hugo (also played by Naschy) and some friends head up to the old family estate-- only to be haunted by the ghost of Alaric, who will not rest easy until his head is reunited with his body. Or so he says. You know better, right? There are a rather astounding number of subplots as well, but that's the main story.

This was played up to me as a zombie film, and to be fair, there are about five minutes' worth of really bad zombie-acting, so if you're a zombie movie completist, you've got to get your hands on this one. Also, the script does manage for each leading lady to appear sans clothing at least once, and they're all quite attractive; if that's enough to carry a movie for you, this might work. But if you're looking for a solid plot, well-written characters, decent special effects, or anything else that constitutes a good movie, you should give this one a pass. It's stupidly (and unintentionally) funny in places, and might make for a good drinking game, but as a piece of horror cinema, it fails miserably. * ",1219104000,,1876,4.813664596273292
