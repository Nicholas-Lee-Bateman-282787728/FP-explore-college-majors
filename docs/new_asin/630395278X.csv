Most Christians know about the a great war in heaven.... but after seeing this film they will question theselves about a second war.

740227,5,630395278X,"An excellent good vs. evil flick! Loved every minute of Walken's talented portrayal of Gabriel, the archangel who's waged a war from his own jealousy. Followed by a sequel, but the original stands alone as the best!  Arriving on Earth he is in search of the dark soul of a warrior which has  been hidden inside a little girl, but Gabriel doesn't count on a fight from  a novice priest turned cop and the child's school teacher. The devil is  eager to prevent a second Hell emerging from the second war in heaven. A  great film! I advise you not to see the sequel, yet if you must have  another movie to relieve your disappointment.",946684800,,631,4.443478260869565
740228,5,630395278X,"The Prophecy was by no means a box office hit, unfortunately. Playing on the good vs.evil theme the prophecy takes on huge characters and throws 'em at you with true power.  Especially noticeable is Walken, who plays the  hateful yet somewhat hilarious, Gabriel. Gabriel it seems has decided to  revolt against heaven, becuase of God's preferred treatment of humans.  This can only lead to epic battles and even an appearance by the devil,  played amazingly by Viggo Mortensen. Truly a film worth watching, although  i would recommend the sequel much more than than the original.  This is a  stage show for Walken at his best, which increases the films worth. The DVD  format offers the film you can get on any other format but with primed up  sound and picture, it is the story and characters that make it worth the  money to buy this edition though, so hop on it and buy the sequel as well.",945993600,4,892,4.617834394904459

740687,3,630395278X,"I didn't like how Gabriel was portrayed in this movie as being more like a murderous thug as opposed to being the Bright and Morning Star of Nebadon, this being my belief as a student of The Urantia Papers. Of all the names of angels they had to choose from when picking their ""bad guy who wears the black hat"" (in this case, the ""bad angel with greasy black hair""), I couldn't help but wonder why the writer selected the name of Gabriel, our local universe's chief executive and the personal rep of the Sovereign Son known best in our planetary neck of the woods by the name given at birth in Bethlehem, Jesus. The Lucifer Rebellion began around 200,000 earth years ago and it was certainly no exaggeration when they referenced this as being ""a war in heaven"" where angels needed to listen to both sides of the argument as presented by Gabriel vs. Lucifer before making a final decision as to which side of the proverbial fence of Good vs. Evil they wholeheartedly desired to wind up on. But Gabriel is the mighty and steadfast Warrior representing God who exposed The Lucifer Manifesto for what it really is, a treacherous pack of lies. When I read a detailed account of Lucifer's ludicrous propositions as spelled out in his unholy declaration of war against God, I was amazed that one who was created a few levels above our paygrade could sink to such lowly depths of depravity even sparing not the Jerusem kids in the probationary nursery on the finaliter's world (those precious little ones from planets like ours who died too soon) from being exposed to his repulsively repugnant pitch of death deceptively disguised as something else. But once I started taking my attention away from the names of characters, I wound up being more than just entertained by the acting and the over-acting. In the end, I realized that The Prophecy tells a story about faith where men and women and angels are free to determine their individual destinies by the faith-filled or faith-deficient choices they make.",1419120000,4,2000,4.717142857142857

The concept was pretty cool...angels being these terrible bloodthirsty and cruel creatures that suffer from the same passions as mortals and are engaged in an ancient war. One faction is upset humans were given the favor of God, the other side ( for some not clearly explain reason ) fight against them.

But after coming up with the cool concept things just went to cinematic hell. Wooden acting ( check out the hero's never-changing facial expression ), a plot that keeps you saying ""huh?"" ( what's with angels that can't fly and have to resort to body shoves to giht mere mortals ), an obnoxious constant droning choir soundtrack ( I suppose all movies with a religious theme have an obligation to have a choir ), an overall ""low budget"" look ( everyone drives cars that are at least 20 yrs old and the special effects are strictly B grade ),  weird wardrobe choices for the lead actress ( the school's teacher gets to wear a midriff-exposing shirt ?!?), etc etc.

Vigo Mortensen was pretty creepy as the Devil...but even he had what looked like blonde hair tips from a fading hair dye job. Did they run out of a budget in the makeup department ?!?",1409097600,,1278,4.567685589519651

It's not the kind that you can fast forward, so if you get bored, be patient, or you may miss a great deal of important scripting in the plot.

Similarly the sound quality was quite poor, on par with a DVD.  No closed captions were available, which is extremely uncommon for blu-rays, but is common for DVDs.

740884,4,630395278X,"The film opens as angel expert, near priest Thomas (Elias Koteas) has visions and leaves the seminary to become a policeman, one that investigates strange killings done by angels. There is a ""second war"" in heaven that wasn't described in detail enough in the Bible, so the film made up an extra chapter for the Revelation of John. The script smartly confounds the roles of the angels as simply good and evil as both sides take on duel characteristics. Christopher Walken plays Gabriel in a rather creepy manner while Viggo Mortensen plays a charismatic Lucifer. Good script. Good performances.

On a side note, Revelation was designed to have 22 chapters with each chapter representing a letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Lucifer was the Roman ""Light Bringer"" a title given to Ishtar in the role of Venus the morning star who brought the light of the sun. Venus was the ""rebellious"" archangel of lore who remained shining while all the other planets were no longer visible. Jerome anachronistically translated ""The Light Bringer"" in Isiah as Lucifer and it has stuck with us ever since.

740889,4,630395278X,"This is a highly original and highly effective outlook on introducing the seemingly innocent theme of ""angels"" into the world of horror and suspense. Walken gives an expert performance; everything from his morbid and haunting looks, to his quiet manner and poetic dialogue. This is one of those movies you need to pay attention to in order to truly ""get it"", and to get the entire picture all three movies are needed to be seen, or so I assume. The little girl who plays Mary also does her part well - so thankfully we have no annoying children actors we wish would be killed off early in the film. Although creative and entertaining this movie to me did happen to lag in certain scenes, and I kept mentally pushing the fast-forward button in my head a few times.

A beautifully  directed and well-thought out plot, you find yourself getting pulled into what is happening with the characters, and it's hard to walk away without finishing until the end. When a movie has done that, it's passed the test.

Viggo Mortensen (LOTR) does a very eerie and creepy impression of Lucifer when he does show up - I wish we could have seen more of him. He is as gorgeous as hell - most of the men in the movie were. But when you have a man who can still look divine eating a bloody heart - well, you gotta love him.

This movie is that dark-themed, serious horror I cherish, although in certain ways a little too slow-paced when it didn't need to be, but evey movie has to have a small flaw--and this is its only one.",1379635200,,1504,4.399280575539568

740966,3,630395278X,"I didn't much know, and after a while didn't much care, what this was all about.  What I understood was the fact that two Bad Non-Humans were knocking about Good Humans in order to get some or all Humans to do something to help one of them. In the end, the outcome seemed to depend on a small group of  Native Americans who may not have been Christians or members of any other group that accepted  Christian Religious Myths (so far as I can tell they were not Christians although nothing is said  on the point.) As the  film progresses a detective, who rejected becoming a Christian Priest (? ) at the very moment he was to become one,  on a mission to stop the Bad Non-Humans, meets a non-Native American school teacher who supervises the Native American student to whom one of the Bad Non-Humans has  passed something invaluable (without her knowing) the nature of which I never figured out.  Almost literally within less than a day they have fallen in love for no other reason it appears than that a little romance never hurts a picture.
Now this is what I saw. I am perfectly ready to admit that some of the monologues and some of the dialogues I couldn't hear well enough to know what was said. Much of the dialogue I heard made no sense to me. The events as I saw and recount them, can be all wrong.
The acting, given the nature of the activities in which the actors were engaged, was capable. The film was sufficiently popular to have had four sequels (included in a five film Miramax DVD set-the cheapest way to get to see any or all of them).

740968,5,630395278X,"One of my favourite films of the mid to late 1990's.

The Prophecy exclusively borrows a line from The Second Testament: Revelations, from the apostle Paul to be exact where in an obscure passage about ""angels carrying savage weapons in relation to a War in Heaven.' This is included in the film as is the premise that there is a Second war in Heaven. This Second War is angels allegedly upset that fallible man having his soul elevated by God which makes him equal if not superior to that of Angels and Archangel.

The Prophecy has the archangel Gabriel (played brilliantly by Christopher Walken) in the film lead this second group of rebellious angels against God, and the angels still loyal to God,and create a second heaven.

The prophecy within The Prophecy
A dark soul holds the key to the battle as whomever posses it will win the war. Gabriel and one of his lieutenants, Usiel ( possibly Uziel) are the avenging angels who require a dark soul. This dark soul is still in the body of a man who has just died.  and NOT yet posses which is in the body of a human Colonel. The dark soul is in the body of a warrior - a psychotic, bloodthirsty murderer whom fought in the Korean War.  The Dark Soul is considered cunning, ruthless, cold and has negative qualities not found in angels. The good guys led by Simon (Eric Stolz) on the behalf of Archangel Michael (this is inferred and never clearly stated in The Prophecy), MUST get to this dark soul first and try to hide it from Gabriel and his band so that it can ""naturally"" progress to Lucifer's hell.

The Strength
The strength of the movie is that it is beautifully filmed amongst the Grand Canyon and parts of Colorado. The main protagonists are Chritopher Walken, Eric Stolz, Elias Koteas and Virginia Madsen. The acting is good, in fact very good for what would have been a small budget film. The mixture of beautiful film, good acting, relatively good story and a sense of humor work well.

The Devil
Played brilliantly by then practically unknown Viggo Mortensen who went on to be Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Viggo plays the part exquisitely. Even his introduction is brilliant. The main female lead, Virginia Masden who plays Katherine is forlorn. It is evening and she is wondering what is going to happen to one of her school children, Mary,  if Gabriel gets to her.  Katherine is staring into the distant .... the camera pans towards Masden when you notice a silouhette. This silouhette gets closer yet stays dark. We hear the softly spoken words ""Hello Katherine' to which she replies "" Who are you"".  After asking her question the camera closes in on Viggo (Lucifer) and she then says ""Oh, my God"" as do we, because the brilliant camera work now clearly illustrates that this softly spoken being has immense malevolent power. I will not further labor with the scene as you have to watch it to get the full impact.

Devil's Offer
Lucifer does NOT want two hells and tells Katherine and Thomas on how to defeat Gabriel. Faith is the key, surprise, surprise and Gabriel is defeated. Lucifer in a truly engrossing scene eats Gabriel's heart whilst its still beating. Angel Heart anyone ?. Lucifer then asks both Katherine and Thomas to join themas he will love them more than Jesus. Surprisingly, they decline. They have obviously forgotten the ""it is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven"" rule.

It is also the discipline and restraint that make The Prophecy a landmark film. I understand that it has spawned a myriad of Prophecy films. I urge people to watch The Prophecy as it is very good. However, give ALL the movies after the first one a miss, If you suffer the same syndrome as Lot's Wife, that is, you have to see how bad the other movies are, you will turn to salt and become a bitter as you will wonder how a great first film spawned a bunch of shocking movies that came after.

740971,4,630395278X,"Writer/Director Gregory Widen brings a strange new twist to the supernatural thriller in THE PROPHECY, from 1995. The angels of Widen's world are crass, bitter beings that despise humanity as well as they do the God that created them. They are led by Gabriel, who looks to free the angels from their endless life of servitude by unleashing Hell on Earth through a war in Heaven. Walken is as eccentric and unusual as ever here, using his signature brand of quirkiness to set his performance apart as Gabriel. He is able to transform a sly smile into a cruel and malevolent grin, shaping this peculiar role into another of his more powerful and memorable performances. Elias Koteas is equally good, although much more straightforward, as ex-priest Thomas Dagget, humanity's only hope for survival. Viggo Mortensen also sneaks in a delightfully devious appearance as the devil in an attempt to play the humans against his rivals in Heaven. While the action beats are few and far between, the underlying mystery and odd assortment of characters behind THE PROPHECY make this another entertaining addition to other religious thrillers like ANGEL HEART, LORD OF ILLUSIONS, and THE NINTH GATE.

- Christopher Walken.  I just like to see movies that he's in, even though this one was fairly corny.

Well, the story is kind of goth and all notions about angels being benevolent creatures are soon demolished as in ""The Prophecy"" they mostly resemble violent gangster demons.

Things I disliked:

- The male characters in this movie all talk like N.Y. gangsters in a Scorcese flick.  Actually it is comparable to a gangster flick with the angel Gabriel (!) as a sort of demonic hitman fighting to get somebody's soul and kill a little girl for the purposes of opening up heaven again.. or something like that..  and he seems to be fighting, not only the local homicide detective, but Lucifer himself (played by Viggo Mortenson).

- Viggo Mortenson as the devil.

- the plot.

Well, in a nutshell, this movie ends seeming more than a little silly. It's almost a B-movie except in terms of production.

""The Prophecy,"" 1995, was a underrated, relatively unknown classic when it was first released. It has since spawned several sequels.

Make no mistake, this is Christopher Walken's film. His performance as the archangel""Gabriel,"" the vengeful angel that wants to take on the almighty, & his love of ""talking monkeys"" (humans) is the mantel piece of this film! Walken just spews venom & sarcastic wit all over the screen! It is doubtful that anyone else could portray his ""Gabriel,"" as convincingly evil, vengeful, & jealous, as Walken.

The film is also filled with other good to great performances. Eric Stoltz as ""Simon,"" a faithful angel to god, is very convincing in his role to stop Gabriel from destroying heaven. Virgina Madison (Candy Man) puts on a solid performance as Katherine, caught in the middle of this festering war. Viggo Mortensen has a cameo as the great dark one himself, which matches Walken's intensity! The scene, essential to the film.

The script is intelligent, witty, & pretty much right on target, as the actors get to chew on it like pack of wolves over a bloody femur bone. The direction is darkly elegant, & the editing makes for a fascinating film that does not lag, though this is not a fast paced film, for the film is designed for it's fascinating subject, & makes one want to dig in deeper to it's dark theme.

741170,5,630395278X,"As stated in my header, I am not a religious person in any way but this movie was excellent. I really can't say anything bad.
The basic story is, Gabriel (Christopher Walken) is a human hater. As he calls us, ""Talking monkeys"". He has decided to obtain a dark, human soul prophesied to turn the tide in the battle between Heaven and Hell and yes, Gabriel wants to take on Heaven. A good angel, Simon (Eric Stoltz) is attempting to stop him.
Add a detective (Elias Koteas) that has had a difficult time with his faith because he was once attempting to become a priest but when taking his final vows, had a vision of angels being torn apart in the war in Heaven. He did not complete the vows, and left the church. Now he is ""destined"" to help on the side of good.
Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen) has a small part but it is probably the most chilling Lucifer you will ever see. Viggo does not choose small parts but in this movie, he made it so memorable and believable that he was as evil as foretold.
Interesting writing made for an entertaining movie such as:
""Angels can't drive"" so Gabriel has to make humans that are near death do his driving. He keeps them alive telling them, ""If you don't help me, I can keep you here, rotting"".
When the angels stop to look around or search the area, they ""perch"" on things. This was a great touch in my opinion.
I recommend all 3 movies but read the reviews of part 2 before deciding to buy. In my opinion, 1 and 3 are the best but 2 is more of a B movie.",1286323200,,1490,4.213286713286713

Back when Christopher Walken wasn't yet so much a caricature of himself he made THE PROPHECY, a horror film watchable enough that it spawned several sequels. THE PROPHECY is also weird and drags in spots and is at times very funny, and it's very funny, intentionally or unintentionally, because of Christopher Walken who is one of cinema's great demented presences.

Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas) - who turned his back on priesthood - lost his faith not because he couldn't glimpse enough of what heaven has in store but because he glimpsed too much. Today Thomas Dagget is a jaded homicide detective, and his most recent murder case will draw him into a celestial war that had been raging for two thousand years. In the mangled corpse's home he finds an ancient bible and the 23rd chapter of the St. Johns Revelations - except that there is no 23rd chapter in Revelations. And the corpse, it isn't human. Or as the police coroner incredulously asks Dagget: ""Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice?"" Well, if the halo fits...

Cut to the chase, the Archangel Gabriel nurses a mad grievance. He condescendingly refers to man as ""talking monkeys,"" and maybe there's irony in that the Devil similarly refers to man. But it festered in Gabriel, that God favors man over seraph. And so in heaven Gabriel launched a second rebellion. But it seems that the seraphim come nowhere near humanity in sheer evil and malevolence. There is the desperately coveted ""blackest soul on earth"" which belonged to a vile and despicable man - whose very wickedness could turn the tide in Gabriel's favor - except that the good angel Simon (a scuzzy-looking Eric Stoltz) had beaten Gabriel to the soul. In his dying moments Simon plants the soul inside a little Navajo girl, and this serves as the story's central plot engine. Gabriel stalks the little girl. Detective Dagget, tattered faith and all, and an elementary school teacher named Katherine (Virginia Madsen) race to save her.

This came out in 1995, but it's still miles better than LEGION. THE PROPHECY is ambitious and juuuust a tad revisionist and comes with nice twists but, geez, is it all over the place. Partly it's the modest budget as writer/director Gregory Widen is forced to make do with a smaller canvas. So, we don't get the payoff of an epic battle between hordes of angels, nothing like that. We do get to briefly glimpse a scene rife with fallen angels staked on a blasted landscape. But mostly the two-thousand year war lurks in the background or in the mind, remaining more as this unarticulated theological curiosity. Then, late in the game, a dash of American Indian mysticism serves to further untether the film.

I liked Elias Koteas fine in this movie, but I wonder if another actor couldn't have done more with the role of Detective Dagget? Dagget demonstrates such rich potential, it's a shame to see it go to waste. On the other hand, Christopher Walken makes the most of his part. Walken is simultaneously menacing and weird and goofball. Walken's mannerisms are so awesomely over-the-top that even Dennis Hopper thinks he should dial it down. Although make no mistake, Gabriel is properly chilling when he scornfully states to his cowering prey: ""I'm an angel. I kill first-borns while their mamas watch. I turn cities into salt."" Walken's creepiness is perhaps exceeded only by Stoltz's creepiness. Eric Stoltz is one of them champion cryptic performers, and sometimes what he does goes over my head. But was anyone else put off by his disturbingly child predator vibe in that one scene with Mary? And he's supposed to be a good guy.

Besides Walken, this movie is worth checking out for Viggo Mortensen's brilliant late cameo as the Devil. Talk about creeeeepy. In a strange twist of things, Lucifer sides with the good guys on this one because, in his own words: ""Two hells is one hell too many."" Still, be very careful when the Devil's in your corner.

I do like me the odd touches. I thought it was awesome how the angels can so precariously perch on furniture, and at the same time make it look so ominous. One non sequitur has Gabriel, for whatever reason, unable to drive a car and so he makes use of zombie servants to act as his wheel man. This gives Adam Goldberg's re-animated but festering character an opportunity to make wise with some macabre humor. And then there's Gabriel teaching one of the school kids how to blow his horn...",1282521600,4,4689,4.753071253071253

One mean old U.S. Army Colonel who once perpetrated a genocide seems a good starting point.

A good angel (one of God's army) is out to stop the traitorous Gabriel  but he's not quite personally up to the task. Still, he manages to indirectly recruit a cop who was once up for Catholic Priest ordination until he lost his faith following a vision of the ongoing war between the good and bad angels. And the cop is aided by a small town lady school teacher who doesn't quite understand the entire picture but stays in the game to heal a Native American Indian student who has, through a comedy of errors, become an unwilling repository for all the old Colonel's evil souls.

Gabriel goes on the hunt but, as an angel, he comes up short in one department: he can't drive a car! So he has to enlist the aid of loser humans (attempted suicides, etc.) to chauffer him from place to place.

Gabriel draws closer and closer to his goal but, sometimes, war makes for strange bedfellows and the old line, ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" comes to fruition here.

Both Walken and Mortensen are superb in this supernaturally religious mobile exorcism. I'm usually not a fan of new age films but here, First Look Pictures, Neo Motion Pictures, and Dimension Films produced a definite winner. This 1995 movie was written and directed by Gregory Widen.

The additional casting is terrific and the color cinematography is first-class. The aspect ratio is 2.35:1 (letterbox), the running time is 97 minutes, and the music was composed by David C. Williams. This film is rated R and is close captioned.

Years later, he has become a police officer, and after working one day he returns home to see a long-haired Eric Stoltz standing on the back of a chair in his apartment.  If that doesn't scare you into religion, nothing will.  Well, Simon (Stoltz) mentions that he saw the same visions as Thomas, ostensibly to prove some sort of transcendent connection.

Stoltz, an angel who gathers the souls of recently deceased, returns to his apartment, registered under an alias, where he is attacked by an evil, hermaphrodite angel.  We know this second guy is evil because the new guy has obsidian black eyes, and dies quicker than ensign Johnson on a Star Trek away mission.  Upon his death, he just so happens to be carrying a Bible with the 23rd Chapter of St. Johns Revelations, which doesn't exist on earth.  It is within the bible that Daggett learns that there is a heaven-and-hell battle between angels.  Some of the angels, namely Gabriel (Christopher Walken) are upset that God has allowed humans into heaven.  The recent death of the most evil man on the planet provides the ultimate weapon in that battle, and it's a search for his soul - a soul that Simon has taken and hidden inside a little girl.

In the end there is just a little bit too much going on, and the people are way too composed considering they are in the midst of the angel battle, zombie slaves of Gabriel, evil souls being exorcised, winged angels flying over head, and the Devil audibly conversing with people on an Indian Reservation.  Walken's great, but the rest of the movie is only slightly above average, and the plot seems to be just a bit too involved and far-fetched.",1212019200,,1915,4.717717717717718

741355,4,630395278X,"This is one ambitious movie. Not only does it cover some seriously controversial territory, it does so with style and an abundance of talented actors. I recall the first time I saw the movie back in the nineties and just how fascinated I was by the whole thing. Watching it now in a more critical way, I realise that it is certainly not without flaws, but nothing can take away just how interesting the plot is, nor how wonderful a couple of the performances are.

Angels come to Earth to continue a war that has been raging in Heaven. The angel Gabriel seeks a soul that he will use to end the war and subsequently open a new Hell. The angel Simon also seeks the soul, but with the purpose of hiding it from Gabriel. It's not surprising that humans become entangled in this battle and it is left to a former priest and a little girl to stop Gabriel, with some help from the least expected of beings, Lucifer himself.

This may all sound fairly ridiculous, and if you really study it, I guess it kinda is. But the style of the movie and the performances make it work. The angels are fascinating creatures. Their way of perching on top of things like a bird is such a simple way of distinguishing them and immediately marks them as different to the humanity surrounding. While the flashes of the war in Heaven may not look as amazing as a bigger budget may have allowed, it certainly gives the viewer an idea of the horror involved, with screaming angels dying upon massive spears.

There is no doubt that Christopher Walken makes this film! He gives Gabriel such an amazing amount of charisma along with such a threatening persona. His regular sniffs, licks and head tilts are both disturbing and fascinating and every piece of dialogue that omits from his mouth is given life and importance. It's just a stunning portrayal of a powerful being and displays why he is such sought after villain these days. Eric Stoltz is also very good as Simon, yet he simply doesn't have the presence of Walken. Viggo Mortenson on the other hand displays his scene stealing abilities that would become even more prevalent as Arigorn years later. It's not often that an actor would get the chance to play the angel of darkness, and even less often that the character would be fighting on the same side as the movie's heroes. It's inspired writing combined with inspired casting.

Although I obviously thoroughly enjoy ""The Prophecy"", there are certain aspects that stop me from calling it a classic movie. I do feel the creators of the film did wonderfully well with the budget they had, but a movie of this scale could so easily have been made monumental with a bit more money for special effects and sets. Most of the film is situated in the desert, which is a rather strange setting for such a dark film. I can't help imagining how effective this plot would have been had it been located within a major city, with the heavenly battle breaking out into the lives of a large population. But that's being greedy.

Some of the writing also could have been better. The occasionally dodgy dialogue is generally saved by the performances, but there are also quite a few plot holes and lack of explanation that stop the film from rising above being a very good B movie. But I don't want to nit pick ""The Prophecy"" too much, because it's a thoroughly entertaining and ambitious horror movie, sprinkled with comedy and action. If you're a fan of religious context horror or Christopher Walken, then this is a must see.",1160697600,11,3494,4.584
741356,4,630395278X,"Heaven's been closed for the past two thousand years because of a war between the angels, with Christopher Walken's Archangel Gabriel leading those eager to do away with the talking monkeys who have supplanted them in God's affections, and now the War in Heaven has spilled out onto Earth. These angels aren't the benign, mournfully watchful figures of Wings of Desire or City of Angels, let alone the make-a-wish do-gooders of Touched by an Angel. These are God's hitmen, creatures that spend their whole existence praising God with one wing dipped in blood. They don't grant wishes, they don't make things better and you really, REALLY wouldn't want to see one. But, experienced as they are in laying waste to whole nations, they lack man's capacity for true evil and need to find the darkest human soul to show them the way to win. Viggo Mortensen's Lucifer isn't too keen on the situation, fearing a victory for Gabriel's side will result in Heaven becoming another Hell - and two Hells is one Hell too many for him. Stuck in the middle is Elias Koteas' priest-turned-cop, who lost his faith not because Heaven showed him too little but because it showed him too much.

The similarities to writer-director Gregory Widen's Highlander screenplay are apparent, although this boasts a much lower budget but infinitely superior direction, a good visual sense and some great locations. Much of the film's strength is in its ideas and its dialogue: the plotting is at times perfunctory, Virginia Madsen's schoolteacher takes little convincing of the Angelic threat and Walken probably has a little TOO much fun as Gabe, whether letting schoolchildren blow his horn or gleefully explaining ""I'm an angel. I kill firstborns while their mamas watch. I turn cities into salt. I even, when I feel like it, rip the souls from little girls, and from now till kingdom come, the only thing you can count on in your existence is never understanding why."" The ending too is more than a little awkward. But the good points outweigh the bad.",1156636800,9,2025,4.886627906976744
741357,5,630395278X,"You can tell pretty quickly in this film that Gregory Widen, the man who shot Highlander, also shot this film. It involves a number of great actors, a really bizarre premise, and some great landcapes and characters. In both movies you have to agree to suspend your disbelief about the plot, and just enjoy the power that each actor puts into his or her role.

Here's the basic summary. Angels are not the Renaissance golden-haired glowy, friendly creatures that DaVinci conned us into believing in. Re-read your Bible. Angels were the holders of swords of flame. Angels were the ones out there slicing down the non-believers and killing by the thousands. They were a fierce army. Unknown to mankind, many angels were pretty grumpy when Jesus died on the cross and in essence elevated mankind over the angels. The angels felt betrayed, ignored by God. It's like when Mom came home with a new baby brother and suddenly the new baby was the one getting all the attention. The angels were the older sibling, about to throw a temper tantrum.

Fast forward to modern times. You have an ex-priest-wannabe-turned-cop Thomas, played by Elias Koteas, who starts to get called in on some strange cases. Turns out the dead guy they find is a hermaphrodite, is carrying a 2nd century Bible and is branded with the mark of an angel. The trail leads to Simon, another angel, who is trying to help keep a ""really evil soul"" from Gabriel (Christopher Walken). Gabriel wants this evil soul to help him storm heaven, to make God pay for turning His back on all the angels. Simon gets his hands on the soul in question, but with Gabriel hot on his heels, he has to hide it somewhere. He puts it into a Native American girl's body.

Soon we have a showdown betwee Thomas, Gabriel, the young girl, her tribe, and of course Lucifer, played by Viggo Mortensen. It comes down not to a fist battle, but to a theological argument - how Gabriel looks down on all of us ""monkey boys"" but is insanely jealous that God will not talk to him any more.

So there are many plot problems here. With the war going on for 2,000 years, they are saying that the prophecy of the worst soul of all was some Korean War guy that just died?? Because he resorted to cannibalism?? Heck, I'm sure we can name many people who became cannibals in desperate times. They're pretty sure the Pilgrims did that when they were all freezing / starving to death. It's sad, but if you're about to die, you make some not-so-sane (or maybe sane depending on your point of view) decisions. Surely if they wanted the Ultimate Evil they could have gone for Hitler ... or one of his scientists ... or how about Pol Pot and slaying 2 million people? Some small time cannibal is the worst they could get?

Then, we have Simon walking into a church to an open casket coffin and taking the soul. Do they really leave coffins open all night long in churches? When Simon took the soul, he really had NO plan at all of what he was going to do, knowing he was injured, and just randomly decided to stick it in this girl? The village had many 30 people in it total. Even if Gabriel had to slay everyone in the village to make sure he got to the soul, it didn't seem like much of a problem for Gabriel. He rather would enjoy that.

However, like I said, plot isn't a big thing here. The characters are. Christopher Walken is EXCELLENT as Gabriel, once the shining boy of God, now cut off from the voice. He's eternally young, powerful, and good at manipulation. He believes completely in his right to power and is just so incredibly weary of stupid little monkey-people screwing things up. That all being said - he can't drive?? Surely sometime since cars were invented he could have learned.

Elias is great as Thomas, the doubter who slowly regains his faith. Virginia Madsen (Sideways fame) does well as the schoolmarm who sticks up for Mary, the young girl. Mary really puts in a chilling performance as a once-innocent girl who becomes possessed with the soul of a calculating soldier.

I really enjoyed Lucifer when he showed up at the end of the movie. He perches like a gargoyle, looking down at all of us squirming humans. But he doesn't come across as evil - oh no. Everything the Bible says is that Lucifer is handsome, seductive, oh so compelling. He tells us things we want to believe. In fact it's hard to resist him. In the movie, Viggo slides around the people he talks to, circling them like a snake, moving in close. He wants you to trust him ... he says he doesn't want another Hell, he wants to be the sole ruler. He's going to HELP the humans. If they just trust him.

This isn't really a spoiler, since the movie is rather transparent from start to finish, but I was REALLY disappointed that Lucifer's aims were so straightforward. He is above all a deceiver. So what did the plot do? They put him in where he told the truth, people believed him, did what he said and it all worked out. It was a real let down! Viggo did such a great job with the smooth, ""beautiful"", ultimate power of Lucifer that I was waiting for his dialogue to all be a complex set-up to deceive the people. Instead, nope, he just walks away and turns into a cloud of blackbirds, much like many other movies on this topic.

Still, again, the plot has holes. You just deal with it. There really is a lot of beauty in the storyTELLING - from the landscapes people go across, to the looks in the actors eyes in various scenes. It really is quite telling that some angels have no eyes when they are found - and that other scenes focus in on the eyes as the window to the soul. Since, after all, that is what the movie is all about.",1151107200,27,5646,4.435872709739634
741358,3,630395278X,"The Prophecy is a tale of warring angels and the humans who are involved with a particularly nasty event within it; Gabriel (Walken, in a typically excellent performance) is seeking a secret weapon to break the war's deadlock, and won't let anyone get in his way.

This film gets a solid 'A' for effort, and for taking on a subject matter way, way beyond its limited budget.  On the flip side, it's funereally paced, and sometimes it chooses to be darkly comic instead of dramatic.

Also puzzling to me is the nature of the secret weapon (minor spoiler, nothing earth-shattering).  It's the soul of the perfect killer, which good angel Simon (Eric Stoltz) passes on to a young girl (Moriah Shining Dawn Snyder) to hide it from Gabriel.

Huh?  The perfect killer is a psychotic Korean War vet?  Aside from being somewhat slanderous to veterans, it's also a real head-scratcher.  Without raising nary a bead of sweat I suspect most of us could think of a few past world conquerors, dictators, or serial/mass murderers who would contend for the crown of 'the perfect killer'.

741414,5,630395278X,"""Some people lose their faith because Heaven shows them too little, but how many lose their faith because Heaven shows them too much?"" Such is the fate of Thomas Daggett (Elias Koteas) an aspiring candidate to the Catholic priesthood who receives a horrendous vision of the 'War in Heaven' at the very moment of his ordination. Unable to cleanse his memory of these ghastly images he forsakes his religious vows and becomes a police detective. Apparently he finds dealing with evil on a more personal, human level easier to handle.

Eventually Thomas' visions take on physical form and death and destruction soon follow. Angels begin appearing on Earth in search of a mysterious human ""dark soul."" Thomas becomes involved when the dead body of an angel* is discovered along with a copy of his seminary paper, ""Thesis On Angels In Religious Scripture.""

*[How do they know it's an angel you ask? By all the usual signs of course; empty eyesockets, cellular structure of a newborn, hermaphroditic and of course their hearts have been torn from their chests since that's the only way to kill an angel. 'Basic Angelology 101'].

Also found in the coat pocket of the dead angel is a second century, handwritten copy of ""The Book of the Revelation"" containing a previously unknown 23rd chapter. According to the text, there was a 'Second War in Heaven' and a whole new group of fallen angels were now at war with God, while at the same time unassociated with the forces of Lucifer. The most powerful of the newly fallen is the Archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken).

Director Gregory Widen has brought an incredibly unique and genuinely inspired interpretation of angels to the screen which is unlike anything I could have ever imagined. Instead of focusing on their celestial, god-like attributes Widen has chosen to examine the creaturely aspects of these immortal beings. Like birds of prey they squat on rocks and fences, or when indoors on the back of chairs quietly observing their surroundings. They sniff at the air like beasts of the field and lick unsavory objects like dogs as they use their heightened senses of smell and taste to locate their prey. It may seem a profane characterization to some, but I found it absolutely fascinating.

It simply doesn't get any better than this. Tight, well conceived and inventive storyline with insightful dialogue and lots of great quotable lines like: ""Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice"", ""Study your math - key to the universe"", ""Two Hell's is one Hell too many"" and my personal favorite, ""Leave a light on Thomas."" Christopher Walken is absolutely magnificent as the heartless, unrelenting Archangel Gabriel and Viggo Mortensen is just as perfect in his portrayal of Lucifer who views this second rebellion as a threat to his own kingdom. Eric Stoltz gives a solid performance as the angel Simon and Elias Koteas could not have been better as Thomas the almost priest turned detective.

This is a fantastic film that was way ahead of its time! Some Orthodox material, some not, but it all works together perfectly. Marvelous directorial job by Gregory Widen who has literally redefined the angelic persona in cinema for generations to come. This is without a doubt primary reference material for any future filmmakers who might wish to delve into the same subject matter.

The angel leading the new war in Heaven is Gabriel, played amazingly by Christopher Walken.  When the movie begins there has been a stalemate in the war between the angels loyal to God and those wanting humans to be barred access to Heaven.  Gabriel's angels determine that the key to winning this war and closing Heaven to the humans forever is by finding the most evil soul on Earth, a soul that belonged to a general that has just passed away and now the hunt is on to see which side will reach the soul first.

Standing in Gabriel's way is the angel Simon, an angel still loyal to God, who has found the soul and is hiding it inside a little indian girl.  Assisting Simon is a former would-be priest turned athiest cop, who begins to understand that if Gabriel is not stopped and the gates of Heaven do not reopen to the humans, there will be Hell on Earth.

This movie is well done and deals with some very fun ideas about angels and humans.  Granted it's not the most theologically sound movie, in fact it's far from it; however, inaccurate the movie may be it isn't blasphemous either in my opinion.  Not a movie to form your opinions of Christianity upon, but still a fun sci-fi, religious thriller that raises some good points and shows a great journey for the athiest cop to come back to his faith.

Also, look for a brief appearance by Satan (played by a pre-Lord of the Rings, Viggo Mortensen) that is very well done, in which he shows Gabriel the error of his ways, by instructing him that this new war is steeped in jealousy, and jealousy is evil which makes Gabriel no better than Satan.  Satan's reason for interfering in the war to help humans because though he doesn't care one ounce about us, he doesn't like that due to Heaven being blocked it could create another Hell and that's one to many in his mind, so he acts more out of self-preservation than anything else.

741419,4,630395278X,"This film is based on the biblical account concerning the fall of rebellious angels, led by Lucifer, who refused to bow, on God's command, to his new creation, the human being. Lucifer became tremendously jealous over God's love for these seemingly inferior beings. (Referred to humorously as monkeys by Gabriel in the film) After refusing to pay homage, Lucifer began to stir-up trouble in heaven, eventually leading to his banishment from the holy realm, enforced by non other than the Archangel Michael, taking thirteen legions of angels with him into exile. The Prophecy takes this biblical account further, referring to the last and alleged missing chapter of the Book of Revelations, by proposing that heaven was split between those angels loyal to God, and those intent on destroying creation all together. A terrible and bloody war was waged between the opposing angel forces in heaven, and the final battle, as the film speculates, will be waged, and finalized, on earth.

Christopher Walken plays the Archangel Gabriel. The character is hell-bent on decimating human kind completely, and his strategy is to capture the darkest soul on earth, who will then lead human kind to its ultimate destruction. Walken gives a compelling and charming performance as the disgruntled angel, only wanting ""everything as it was before"", that is, before human souls took up so much of God's attention and love in heaven. As Walken can do so well, he portrays a particularly nasty individual, yet at the same time, personifies the entire story's central theme, and that is, the results of ""sibling rivalry"" on a cosmic scale.

The story of the Fallen Angels, immortalized in Milton's classic epic poem, ""Paradise Lost"", is essentially a moral tale of sibling rivalry, children fighting over the attentions of a loving parent. ""Father has always loved you more than I."" And because of the child's behaviour and disobedience, refusing to get along with their siblings, are kicked out of the house, banished from the realm, and consequently make trouble for everybody else.

Viggo Mortensen (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) puts in a convincing performance as the dark and brooding Lucifer; and Eric Stolze (Pulp Fiction) as the good angel, Simon, although a small appearance in the film, also gave a noteworthy performance.

The Prophecy is the first film of a trilogy - Prophecy II and III are also quite good, particularly II, as we gain greater insight into the reasons behind the warring angels.

Basically after the War in Heaven with lucifer, the angels rebeled and started a second war in Heaven because they were jelouse that God placed man/humans in His grace and not the angels, however this section was ommited in Revelations being Chapter 23.

A cop who had a vision while going into the priesthood years ago which scared him to leave to become a cop instead goes to investigate an unusual murder, which the victim has an old Bible with Him. However as no one else notices, This Bible has Rev Chapter 23 included.

Christopher Walken plays the part of Gabriel, leader of the angelic rebelion and fits the part so perfectly I doubt anyone could fill those shoes but Him 'Christopher Walken'...

Even just watching the movie for Christopher Walkens smart a** comments about people and how He places Himself above people is halarious but still goes along perfectly with the movie, plus I don't think anyone has a dark humor the way Walken can portray!

There is a fair amount of humor in the movie, but it is masked in terrific action scenes. One of the strengths of the film is its perverse view of angels. They are certainly not the winged cherubs of Hallmark and children's storybooks. These angels are formidable, and they rush about wreaking havoc. They can roar like lions, and they can slay like beasts. Widen had the temerity to choose Gabriel to be his villian. It was audacious, like casting the Pope as a drug lord, and making the Vatican a crack palace. And he has angels losing their faith, falling prey to the pitiful emotions of jealousy and envy. As one character said,"" A whole existence spent praising God, but always with one wing dipped in blood.""

The film was dominated by Christopher Walken as Gabriel. He wore a long black frock coat, ala Wim Wenders, and those coat tails flapped menacingly as the strutted amongst us. He seemed to accentuate mannerisms and gestures from his own persona, creating a character that will live in cinematic infamy. He wore yellow contacts some of the time, making his eyes look demonic. He sported corpse-pale skin, and his eyes burned out of that white face. He had dyed his hair jet-black, swirled back in his trademark pompadour. Whenever on the screen the scene would ignite, swirling with his own special electricity. The other actors appeared dim in comparison. It has been said of him that Walken can be scary just whistling a happy tune.

Widen's plot, although vigorous and original, is full of holes. The angels have to become mortal, or partially mortal, to exist on earth. But Gabriel can't drive, so he needs a ""familiar"", an undead assistant. Several of the angel characters are killed, with their hearts ripped out of their chests. Supposedly, they do not have a soul, so what are we supposed to believe actually happens to their life essence? Our soul is just the spiritual energy that will return to Heaven, where they already reside. What do they need a soul for? They are already on the other side. The notion that countless centuries have passed without any human soul being able to journey to Heaven is a bit harsh to grasp. What about the Big Guy, God himself? It is very existential to assume that God just sat back in his cosmic corner, and was willing to let humans and angels and demons work this out. Where is even the tiniest bit of logic in Widen's premise? How could this situation ever manifest itself without divine intervention?

Viggo Mortensen gave a powerhouse performance as Lucifer. This was a complex cameo; one that could have been wasted on a lesser actor. He gave it tremendous gusto, power, and a creepiness that was unforgetable. He had to find the balance between consumate evil and inescapable logic. This role preceded the RING trilogy, but he was always stardom just waiting to happen.

Elias Koteas, a fine actor, did a pretty good job playing the tortured hero, failed priest turned cop, Thomas Daggett. He, initially became a spokesman for the faithless, but when the very skies opened up and the devil ravens swarmed all about, and his immortal soul was on the line, he clung to his renewed faith and his very human soul with the tenacity of a drowning man. Virginia Madsen, the sister of actor Michael, played the teacher, Katherine. She was dedicated to the education and safety of her Navajo students. Her part, although not strongly written, was an important piece of the puzzle. She gave it the feistiness and vulnurability that it needed.

Rounding out the cast was Eric Stoltz as the angel Simon. He had come to capture the Dark Soul, and to prevent Gabriel from retrieving it. When he was mortally wounded, and he decided to ""deposit"" that evil essence within the confines of a young Indian girl, things began to roll forward at breakneck speed; ala THE EXORCIST. Stoltz found just the right blend of gentleness and ferocity.

The staging of several scenes was quite memorable. Theology, horror, humor, and anthropology mixed very well. It is a film that sticks with you. Even at that, perhaps it did not merit the several sequels that it spawned. I was challenged and entertained in equal portions.",1097020800,14,4353,4.788282290279628

741490,2,630395278X,"This film starts with choir singers over the credits, which is quietly peaceful and then gets quietly irritating - setting the scene for the rest of the film.
Eric Stoltz looks virtually unrecognisable from the previous role I've seen him in, in `Mask' with Cher. I know he had a lot of makeup and prosthetics on during that film, but not even the eyes look familiar.
Surprisingly enough, one of the ten rules of movies doesn't happen! The old cop says at the start of the film that he will be retiring in two years and three months, and that normally means he dies in his protg's arms after a fatal shoot-out, but not this time. I was surprised.
Christopher Walken is the only reason for watching this film, particularly if you're a fan. I'm not THAT big a fan (only seen him before in `Sleepy Hollow' and `Blast From The Past'), but alongside Jack Nicholson, that guy has the creepiest eyes ever! When he appears - with bad hair - the film seems to lift almost, and his presence alone makes the film watchable.
If you're a `Friends' fanatic, watch out for Adam Goldberg (playing Gabriel's sidekick, Gerry. He played Eddie, in the episode where Joey moved out and Chandler had to get a new roommate.)
Certain parts remind me of certain films, particularly `Sixth Sense' and `Devil's Advocate'. Now if it had Keanu Reeves in it . . .
One of the fight scenes is diabolical! You have to laugh watching it, it's very low key, and there's hardly any effort put into it, which is kind of bad. I could fight better than that, myself!
I wasn't sure why this film was rated an 18, when I started watching it. The `gory' bits are few & far between, but the worst it makes you do, is look away from the screen for barely a second - you want to see the gory bits. It could have got away with being rated a 15 maybe.
I did expect this to be darker, and more of a gothic fantasy film. Reading the blurb at the back, I expected it to be based in heaven, or at least partially, but it wasn't. I'm left sitting on the fence with this film. I wouldn't say it was a great film, but I wouldn't say it's one of the worst films I've ever seen (that place is proudly taken by `Lost Highway', and will remain there). It's a very strange concept for a film, definitely not one that's been thought of beforehand. I won't be watching the sequels, I think one was enough for me.",1062547200,2,2351,4.309255079006772

Think you would want to actually meet an angel? As this film points out, angels always had one wing dipped in blood. For whenever God needed a people, a city, a nation to be chastised- he sent angels to do the killing. The angels in this film, both in terms of quality of acting and special effects are very, very believable.
Another thing that sets this film apart is it's theological and metaphysical sophistication. A very good case is made for a second war in heaven. This is because when God bestowed his Grace, his holy spark, unto humans, he raised them up above the angels. Some angels, like Gabriel, just couldn't stand being made second to ""a bunch of talking monkeys.""
Yet, it is pointed out, that when it comes to slaughter and treachery of the spirit, it is man that excels over any angel. That is why they have come to earth in the flesh- to find the one perfect human Dark Soul that will give them an advantage in their stalemated holy war.

As the holy-turned-evil angel Gabriel he is extremely creepy and powerfully scary, but the awesome twist is that he is hilarious as well. Some actors have good scenes and some actors can steal certain scenes, but Walken is so twistedly diabolical and shockingly funny that he steals the entire movie.

741587,4,630395278X,"Just before The Prophecy was released, there was a lot of excitement about it in certain circles I was a part of.  That excessive hype led to my initial disappointment with the movie.  Over time, though, as I have watched it over again a time or two, my appreciation of the film has grown.  Biblical prophecy and apocalyptic discourses are fascinating to me, and this movie plays off of some of the more far-fetched ideas in the realm of speculation.  As the movie opens, we see Thomas Daggett lose his faith in God at the very moment in which he was to be confirmed as a priest; his loss of faith is interestingly a result of having been shown too much of heaven rather than too little.  The movie then jumps to the present, where Daggett is a police detective investigating the death of a man-like enigma with no eyes and fetus-like cell structure.  We have already seen how this being attacked the angel Simon and lost the fight.  The injuries Simon sustains in the struggle upsets his plans, plans which consist of retrieving the soul of the recently deceased most evil man on earth before ""the enemy"" seizes that soul for their continuing nefarious purposes.  Before Simon dies, he gives the soul to a young Indian girl named Mary, and the plot revolves around the enemy's attempts to retrieve the black soul from her and the efforts of Daggett, Mary's teacher, and a medicine man to release the black soul from within Mary's body.  The enemy, as Daggett learns by translating a Bible found on the body of the initial victim, is none other than the archangel Gabriel.  An unknown 23rd chapter of Revelation in the ancient Bible describes a second war going on in heaven, a war led by the archangel Gabriel who refuses to bow down to the ""monkeys"" of humanity whom God gave souls and thus elevated above the angels.  This is not a ""Left Behind"" type of story about the end times; it is a saga of the second war in heaven, a war among God's angels themselves.  Naturally, such a conflict cannot end without the original fallen angel Lucifer involving himself in the action, and all of this makes for a quite satisfying conclusion to the movie.
This movie is blessed with terrific acting.  Christopher Walken in particular delivers a powerful portrayal of the tortured archangel Gabriel.  There are some pretty good special effects, particularly those showing the horrors of the fighting among the angels in heaven itself.  Most religious individuals should have no real problems with The Prophecy because it never portrays itself as representing some kind of truth or challenges its viewers' own beliefs.  While the movie has its flaws, it succeeds in presenting a problematical storyline with the required seriousness it requires in order to be effective.  It is also improved by small bits of humor along the way, such as Gabriel's dislike for human tears and his inability to drive a car.  This is definitely a must-see for Christopher Walken fans.",1027209600,31,2954,4.747553816046967
741588,3,630395278X,"Conceptually it's a mishmash of half-baked pseudo-theology, and the semi-coherent climax pretty much defines the term 'deux ex machina'.

He gets most of the best lines, though Adam Goldberg as one of his rotting zombie-chauffeurs, and Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer himself get in a few zingers as well.  Eric Stolz is affecting too as God's doomed errand-boy Simon. The two romantic leads are inert by contrast, and on re-viewing this film I found myself fast-forwarding through their scenes.

741592,5,630395278X,"I collect Walken films (there are over 200), and this is the movie that started it all for me. The prophecy brings together all the elements that Christopher Walken is famous for: lizard looks from space, the original rambling frightening dialogue replete with facial twitches and gestures frequently displayed by the criminally psychotic, and fluid performances that are spellbinding in intensity.
 Walken's memorable character is Gabriel, the sometimes brutal angel portrayed as the heavy for some of the bloodier scenes from the old testament. As a result of some his nastier accomplishments (slaughtering all the first born male babies in Egypt for example) Gabriel has gone a bit daft in trying to contemplate the reason for it all. He draws the conclusion that it all is because God is fascinated with man, and does not like him anymore. He states that the ultimate evidence of this is that God no longer talks to him, and has not for ages. So, to regain God's attention, Gabriel declares war on man in a fit of jealousy that dwarfs all his prior acts by far, because it is All Man's Fault.
 Gabriel gathers together his ""mob"" of recalcitrant angels and wreaks havoc on earth. He refuses to allow the souls of men to go to heaven, or hell, which draws the attention of Satan, who really thought the whole war was silly to begin with, but wants his due. Added to this apocalyptic mix is an opposing faction of angels who are convinced that Gabriel must be stopped because God's will, regardless of whether anyone agrees with it or not, must be obeyed.
 Caught in the midst of Gabriel's war are men, who are helpless in the face of his divine fury and the victims of Gabriel's acid sense of humor and malevolent plots to destroy mankind. Walken shines as the preening, murderous, insane Gabriel who refers to people as ""monkeys"" and ""filthy bags of flesh"" that must be the result of God's affections gone horribly wrong.
 This is the second time the actor was cast as a supernatural being. The first time Walken appeared on screen as an ""angel"" or spirit was in Madonna's ""Bad Girl"" video in 1992 (this is currently available on DVD as part of the Madonna - Video Collection 1993-99 ) . The Prophecy dates from 1995, and has thus far spawned three surprisingly good sequels depicting the evolution of the war, Gabriel's angelic fate, and man's participation in the ultimate fulfillment of the Prophecy.
 According to the actor, Gabriel to date, is his favorite all-time role. No small statement considering the impressive catalog of movies Walken has appeared in.",980985600,6,2567,4.798642533936651
741849,4,630395278X,"I was predisposed to like ""The Prophecy"" thanks to a kink for angels which I developed some years ago.  The current obsession with sugar-spun angels makes me gag and I'd just about given up on them as messengers of the worst God has to offer mankind - in the context of the bible, at least, the appearance of an angel is, about 99% of the time, reason to hide under the bed until the screaming stops - until I saw this film.  My faith has been renewed.  In this film, they're horrible creatures but gloriously arrogant and beautiful.  Even the ones who are on God's side don't like us very much
 Christopher Walken, looking as pared-down as I've ever seen him look, gives a quirky performance as usual, as Gabriel, the angel of death who ""smashes in the heads of babies while their mamas watch.""  This isn't a guy you want perching on your hospital bed or talking to your kids, because no matter what the message, it's not going to make you happy.  And yet, Walken conveys a lot of humor in Gabriel who is seen letting school children try to blow his trumpet.  One child succeeds in coaxing a note out of it and the windows of the school explode in a very funny reference to Gabriel's horn sounding the notes that herald the Apocalypse.  By the end of the film, when Thomas (nice touch, that name, linking this failed priest to Thomas the Doubter.) says to Gabriel ""Why didn't you just ASK God?"" and Gabriel replies, ""He doesn't talk to me any more."" I wanted to weep for him.
 Stoltz...well he's never been a favorite of mine, but he was good here; not nearly as low-key and passive as usual.  His turn as the angel Simon (I thought I heard him called ""Samael"" once, a name which makes more sense in context.) was done with just the right amount of off-hand humor to make him a good foil for Walken.  Despite his position as upholder of God's will, Simon is not a nice guy, and you get the feeling that if there had been no reason to care about humans, Simon would have disposed of them as cheerfully as Gabriel does.
 Elias Koteas as Thomas and Virginia Madsen as Katherine, do well as always, but seem hampered by dialogue which occasionally thuds. The angels have all the best lines, the angels and the little girl, Mary, who does a good job with a thankless role.  Amanda Plummer is given almost nothing to do as a dying...well, to be honest, a dead woman who is hijacked along the way to drive Gabriel around the Southwest in search of the soul he needs. Ms. Plummer is usually so cheerfully over-the-top that this role seemed like a sad waste of her peculiar talents.  I can't help but wonder if there isn't a lot more of this film lying around someplace.
 The real star turn, though, is by Viggo Mortensen as Satan - an angel both blindingly unpleasant and ravishingly seductive - once beloved above all else in Heaven.  Boy, does it show.  His Satan is a spoiled brat:  vindictive, jealous and rude.  He has no compunctions about invading personal space and wrapping himself, snakelike, around whoever he's talking to.  He's unrelenting in his search for souls, and even at the end, he's not content simply to take his victory and go home.
 The plot is a little thin; I have a hard time believing that the soul they were searching for was the most evil soul on earth, though there is some indication that the intention was to present the man as an incarnation of a Sin-Eater.  In effect, Heywood has absorbed all the evil of his victims who in their turn absorbed all the evil of their victims and so forth.
 The writing is often cumbersome and fairly shouts ""B MOVIE, B MOVIE!"" in spots.  But I rather liked the effects; they were quirky and surprisingly low-key.  There isn't much gore, yet you remember the violence because it strikes at some internal chord.  The audience isn't dazzled by great light and magic shows, but it is treated to some fairly memorable images such as Satan dissolving into a flock of ravens, or a cave wall covered with angelic script which, when touched, produces something like a video of the war in heaven.  Complete with a field littered with dead and dying angels and some impaled on spikes it is an echo of Heywood's war crimes in Korea.  In fact, the effects are generally more painterly than cinematic, and the vast, strange landscapes are often right out of paintings by Gustave Dor, or reminiscent of Goya's works.
 This is what I call a ""face movie.""  It presents us with a lot of strange and wonderful faces, not just the usual in bland, Hollywood prettiness.  They're part of the landscape, too, they give the film richness and depth that it might not have had with more conventional casting.  Flawed but interesting.  Worth your time.",979862400,102,4686,4.519572953736655
741850,3,630395278X,"The basic premise of this movie is an extremely interesting one. Everyone who knows at least the essentials about God and the Devil in the Christian tradition will remember that a war arose in Heaven, precipitated by Lucifer's haughtiness and pride, and that it ended with the Son of Dawn being ousted from Heaven along with his legions of rebel Angels. This marred the state of the universe somewhat considering that as a result there henceforth was the Devil, Hell with its dark princes, and legions of demons to beset mankind in its existence, but at least it left  believers with the hope of a Heaven unified in God's grace. While these events are not directly featured in the movie, it proposes the notion that if there could be strife among God's Angels once, it might well have happened again, and that the implications of the renewed--or continued--war in Heaven are of the gravest possible nature for mortal man. This is indeed a grandiose and immensely fascinating yarn, and I think you don't have to be a Christian (devout or otherwise) to appreciate the idea of such high metaphysical drama. Alas, it is all wasted. I don't wish to give away too much more of the plot for the benefit of those who would like to see for themselves what this movie is all about, but suffice it to say that the ambitious idea is squandered in petty--albeit quite graphically violent--skirmishes over a rather bizarre pursuit  (which, as it is, refuses to entirely make sense to me) on the part of the celestial players. The story works well with the (to the extent of my knowledge very biblical) notion that an Angel might very well be a truly terrifying creature to encounter, but that's about it for the inspiration of holy awe. The final confrontation between the human protagonist and the heavenly antagonist (yes, indeed) is essentially a ridiculous brawl.
Two things, however, are truly delightful about this movie: the performances of Eric Stoltz, who plays his angelical part with a cool, subdued elegance that at the same time conveys immense warmth (how does he do it?), and that of Christopher Walken, who is given a dreamboat of a character for him to fully play out his capacity for the delectably perverse. If you like any or both of these actors for their particular strengths, the weaknesses of the plot will probably be outweighed  for you by their performances--at least for one or two viewings. Two of the stars I think this movie deserves go to them.",977788800,4,2462,4.76112412177986
741851,4,630395278X,"Of course, the movie turns the conventional wisdom on its head, since Angels are God's goon squad.
Need a few babies killed to make a point?  Send in the Angels.  Need a pair of cities razed, and a wife turned into a pillar of salt?  The Angels can take care of that.
Not people you'd ever really like to meet, are they.  Sure, there is the occasional nice angel, who still follows the will of God.  Of course, he drops the soul of one of the most evil men around in a 10 year old to hide it.  But he's nice.  Honest.
Then there's Gabriel (Christopher Walken).  He's on the naughty list.
Recovering souls for a war against God, that's angel work.  But he always has to keep a trained monkey around for monkey work.  Driving, digging up graves, that sort of thing.
And, somehow, God loves the monkeys more.  It's enough to make you rebel.
While it's certainly not conventional theology, it does raise some interesting questions about the sorts of things you really don't think about.
I admit, some of it is fairly chilling.  Gabriel bringing people back from Death, preventing them from meeting their Maker because he won't drive.  That's cold.

Look,  buy it your even rent it at your own peril: there are episodes of Gomer  Pyle, USMC with more coherent editing, narrative integrity, horror,  and  theological depth.

741854,5,630395278X,"Boy, I saw this movie in VHS and I recently have it in DVD. THERE SO MANY DIFFERENCES !  Right in the beginning you won't see Thomas Dagget talking to that voice (whose I don't know who it belongs), no, you'll see Simon  talking about the first war looking down to an angel's skeleton! In the  first fight sequence you see the bad angel arriving in a great and new  sequence that only appears in THE PROPHECY 2 as well in the first encounter  between Thomas and Gabriel in the church (a new footage that appears only  in THE PROPHECY 2). Before Walken takes information about Mary with  children, it shows him waiting and seeing the horizon with thunders and a  cute sunrise. And skipping to the end, a whole new sequence with angels in  the sky (that also were used in THE PROPHECY 2) and the little girl, Mary,  'putting out' the general spirit (The same mounth effect they used with  Eddie Murphy in the NUTTY PROFESSOR) and to add a great finale a new song  in THE END CREDITS !",962755200,,982,4.335164835164835

Walken, off the red-hot Pulp Fiction, was signed as the lead  character, Gabriel, and did one helluva job. I never doubted for a second  that the second Prophecy movies would be as bad, but this is the one to  see.
Finally, if you doubt me, rent the movie yourself. Thank you",961113600,,423,4.197530864197531

Christopher Walken performs so well in his unusual, quirky & self-deprecating manner. But there were other great performances by a young Eric Stoltz, Amanda Plummer, Virginia Madsen & of course, Viggo Mortenson, who was gleefully evil & scary.
