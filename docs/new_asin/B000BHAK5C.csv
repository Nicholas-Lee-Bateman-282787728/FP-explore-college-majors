With experience I am sure we can do a really fine job. We had a hard time finding the right scissors (you need longer than 7 inch), but my hairdresser finally got me the right pair.  You have to spend a little money on tools, but in the long run you bond better with your pet.  You learn how to cooperate with each other.  This was a really nice homey, no fuss video from a prof. groomer using his own customers to demonstrate.  I really liked it.",1246752000,2,619,4.293103448275862
8086752,3,B000BHAK5C,"This DVD does not show the basics, such as putting the dog on the clipping table and putting his or her head into the loop (do you adjust it for each dog?), trimming the nails, hair between the toes and ear care. If you want to know those things, you have to buy another DVD. It would have been nice to know that before investing in this DVD. Without such basics, I thought the DVD was overpriced.

The Schnauzer grooming was very clear. This DVD is made for someone who already knows how to clip a dog and is looking for Schnauzer specific information.",1154044800,9,553,4.3173076923076925
