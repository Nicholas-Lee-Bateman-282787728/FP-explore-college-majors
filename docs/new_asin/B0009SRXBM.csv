8066305,5,B0009SRXBM,"Although there is little discussion of how music can be the language of the heart and the soul, anyone who loves Mahler's music--especially his second symphony--will not likely disagree.  Yes, this is a stunningly beautiful and moving performance of Mahler's Resurrection Symphony.  The two soloists, soprano Ricarda Merbeth and Argentinian (though her parents were from Slovenia) mezzo Bernarda Fink both sing with passion, precision, and practiced ability.

I'm glad they included the documentary on Mariss Jansons, because watching him conduct, it was evident that he anticipates with delight, each new musical phrase.  The documentary explains how he came to appreciate the fragility of life (as in Urlicht's ""O, roeschen rot!""), for his childhood saw the Nazis take the lives of two of his relatives, and Stalin's regime later claimed another.

The Blu-ray disc is in high definition from a HD source.  The sound formats are PCM stereo and DTS-HD  MA 5.0  Subtitles are English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Korean.  The DTS-HD really lets you feel the atmosphere of the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, and was recorded in 2011.

One of the unique attributes of a filmed performance is the opportunity to watch more closely the musicians and the conductor.  Both are thoroughly involved in the work, and I think you will enjoy seeing the anticipation on their faces (especially Jansons!) throughout the performance.  It does seem that they are speaking the language of the heart and the soul.",1425859200,,1502,5.264705882352941

8066307,5,B0009SRXBM,"The first part is a documentary on Jansons bio. It was done well and to the point.

Part Two is a full performance of Mahler Symphony #2 Resurrection with the Royal Concertgebouw Orch where Jansons is the principal conductor, at the orchestra's fantastic  concert hall. No one will dispute the excellence of this orchestra, which is recently viewed as Number One in the world, and the incredible acoustics of this concert hall. This Blu-ray's recording is excellent. It has incredibly large sound stage. I almost cried when I heard this orchestra under Blomstedt's baton in this hall a couple of years ago. This recording nearly matches a live performance at this hall. A well done job in both technically and orchestral performance point of view.

Now about Jansons' conducting-- he is precise, and delivers his perfectionist refined and harmonic performance in the tradition of von Karajan. No doubt, this performance will appeal to many listeners. I earlier gave tree stars, and commented there was not enough Mahler spirit, or stirring of my soul despite a beautiful music. It still holds true, but I revised it to five stars for the beauty of the music making. I will keep it along with Abbado's and Chailly's performance of the same.",1374364800,3,1239,4.947115384615385
8066308,5,B0009SRXBM,"Haven't seen the documentary yet-- just the concert disc.  The first two movements don't displace Bernstein, but from the Urlicht on this just explodes in passion.",1341014400,4,163,5.269230769230769
8066309,4,B0009SRXBM,"It's not quite the cast needed for a full-blown performance of the ""Symphony of a Thousand,"" but to watch 535 college students assembled on stage to present a creditable performance of Mahler's mighty ""Resurrection"" Symphony is to behold quite an inspiring sight indeed. The DVD begins with a brief background on the composition of the symphony, then presents the concert performance. The young musicians acquit themselves well. They might not have the precise attack and intonation of one of the world's top-rank professional orchestras, but they have every reason to be proud of their achievement in presenting a dramatic and effective performance of this vast, inspiring work.

When I watched the DVD on my television, the sound quality seemed quite good within the obvious limits of the medium. Just for curiosity, I tried playing the audio soundtrack through my stereo system, and found that the presentation seemed compressed. This performance is also available on a CD; I would hope that the sound quality is better, but I have not auditioned that version.

I have several fine versions of the Mahler Second in my CD collection, which is one of the reasons I decided to purchase the DVD rather than the CD. This is a piece of music I love more than almost any other, and I welcomed the opportunity to watch a live performance in the comfort of my home. To see the enthusiasm of these young musicians as they perform this music is truly an inspiration. For those who love the music of Mahler, I recommend this DVD without reservation.",1247011200,4,1540,4.896551724137931
8066310,5,B0009SRXBM,"This performance may not have the passionate Leonard Berntein leaping into the air from his podium, but, even without Bernstein, the music of Mahler speaks for itself, and for all humanity.

Symhony 2, ""Resurrection,"" is Mahler's statement of how mankind can cope with the inevitability of death.  The music struggles with our natural tendency toward denial, or refusal to acknowledge that we too will die, as have those before us.

It is begging for a little light that will illuminate our path to the hereafter.

This performance states Mahler's belief very powerfully, with fully 535 participants on stage.  That's right--535.  Imagine the monumental task of managing all those choruses and musicians to insure that they are all together!

Kory Katseanes achieves this with the Philharmonia Orchestra and the Combined Choirs of BYU--and they are all so young!

If I was surprised at how such an enormous assembly could perform so well in unison, I was even more amazed at the quality of the soloists.  Contralto Francesca Forsyth and soprano Jenny Litster both breathed new life into Mahler's inspiring words.  I hope both will consider the pursuit of professional singing.

Even the lighting and filming of this production were better than I had anticipated. The camera shots of the shadowed immense choir and the dark blue of the ceiling were so fitting for such ethereal music. And please don't skip over the few minutes of an excellent explanatory introduction just before the beginning of the performance.  This helps set the stage for the musical and almost religious experience in which you are about to participate.",1155427200,7,1626,5.117424242424242
