437518,5,6302181461,"I don't understand what people find wrong with the transfer of this film?I think a lot of people have crappy tv's or just have the picture settings far out of balance or maybe sitting to damn close to the tv. When I watched this movie on my HDTV it looked like I was watching it on a 35mm projector at a theater which is very cool because it gives you that throwback feel and the film was shot in 35mm. There's some scratches and dirt specs and that's the way I like my grindhouse movies and that's the way Troma movies are supposed to look. Im not going to explain the movie because everyone knows TA3 and seen it so I'm just addressing the quality of the blu ray. The audio is very good too, it's mono but it's very crisp. Troma does a good job on all of their blu rays and I really think the fans that oppose that really have s*** HDTV's or just too young to understand 35mm movies and not born in the 80's ! Old school people like myself know what to expect from Troma so keep up the good work you always been doing and release more of these classics!",1440028800,,1055,4.101449275362318

437523,2,6302181461,"With no crime left to fight in Tromaville, The Toxic Avenger is forced to find a day job in order to make ends meet, but there is only one company willing to hire a hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength, and that's Apocalypse, Inc., Toxie's arch-nemesis! Toxie unwittingly becomes a pawn of corporate greed and corruption, turning his back on Tromaville when they need him the most! THE TOXIC AVENGER PART III starts off with a bang as Toxie mops up a group of criminals that are trying to replace all of the Independent films in a local video store with mainstream fodder as the patrons plea with them to let them keep their Troma movies. It is one of Troma's shining moments in the series, but it is all downhill from there. The anti-corporate message wares thin quickly, but something just seems missing the entire time... Mainly the over-the-top comedy and absurd gore, both of which have disappeared throughout most of the picture. Ron Fazio and Phoebe Legere are always entertaining as Toxie and Claire, and the snarling antics of Rick Collins' Chairman do make for a fun performance. In reality, THE TOXIC AVENGER PART III is a hackneyed cut and paste job using all of the left over footage from THE TOXIC AVENGER PART II, leaving the third film out as a festering barrel of toxic sludge. As a result, the final half becomes dreadfully boring due to the seemingly endless battle against Apocalypse, Inc. Savor what few laughs you can from the blindsploitation, churchsploitation, and schoolbusploitation or forget that this entry ever existed.

437524,2,6302181461,"The movie started out good. You see Toxic have a pretty good fight scene with some bad guys. Then, it goes off telling us about what happened to get to that point. Well, that was when it got bad. Toxic turned Corporate and turns his back to the people. After that it gets boring because there's really no story to get, he just goes around thinking about what he has done. Then, after he finally realized that he was wrong. He then trys to do right. The only thing is that there's no good fights scenes. All there is boring talking and cheap stunts to see. Then, Toxic just wins and the movie is over. This was pretty disappointing to watch.",1316995200,,640,4.297520661157025
437525,3,6302181461,"The Toxic Avenger Part III is pretty much made up off leftover footage from the Toxic Avenger Part II. That being known, you can tell Toxic Avenger III has a paper thin script. The best part of the movie is the fight scene in the video store, where he rips out a guys intestines.

The plot involves the Toxic Avenger working for the devil, the chairman of Apocalypse Inc, which really doesn't make any since. He battled Apocalypse Inc in Toxic Avenger Part II, so he would already know that Apocalypse Inc is bad. Toxic Avenger wants to get Claire an eye operation. Why is her name Claire in Toxic Avenger II & III, when her name was Sarah in the original? So, if you watched the first two Toxic Avenger movies Part III is going to seem kind of stupid and pointless. Even though is movie pretty much contradicts Toxic Avenger II, I still give it three stars because I enjoyed the first two so much, if you forget about what you know first the first two films part III is fairly entertaining. If you didn't like Toxic Avenger II stay away from this one!",1180656000,,1052,4.36734693877551
437585,3,6302181461,"After the events of part 2, lovable monster superhero Toxie must still deal with the evil forces of the greedy corporation known as Apocalypse Inc. as he struggles to get his fiancee Claire an eye operation to restore her sight. He joins Apocalypse Inc. and becomes a yuppie then the hero every Tromaville citizen loves, unknown to him that the owner of the corporation is actually satan who plans on taking over the town of tromaville but can Toxie regain back his soul and take on the dark lord himself or will Tromaville including humanity will suffer?

An all-right entry of the series though it's not as good as the first, second and fourth entries! The splatter is well done but there's not much of them as shown in the other parts of the saga but the laughs are still there.

This DVD has good picture and sound with the unrated director's cut and cool extras like trailers to this and other Troma movies, an introduction by Toxie creator and Troma president Lloyd Kaufman, interviews with cast, interactive troma map, Toxic Avenger museum with stills and merchandise gallery, easter eggs, where in the world is Toxie? featurette and more.",1179964800,,1146,4.7537688442211055
437586,3,6302181461,"I first got into the Toxic Avenger with this very movie years ago. I loved the humour and the over the top goofyness of it. I became a fan 'cause of this movie and then later on saw Toxie 1 and saw why people didn't like the sequels 'cause they where more comedy driven then gore, like the original.

However, part II does has some great re-inserted gore bits that makes it better then it's original release. I was hoping that this one, part III, the directors cut would have re-inserted some bloody awsome grouseme shots. But, I hardly noticed any changes at all from the old VHS copy I had.

It had been a long time since I watched any of the Toxies, and watching them all on DVD in the correct order, i did see why this movie is said to be the weakest of them all, it does drag for a while through the middle of it and doesnt pick up untill the end. But there is still some great scenes in it.. however, I cant say you will enjoy it, some will, some wont, it depends on taste and how much you loved the first movie I guess.

The DVD contains the movie. The movies fine, except it looked a bit faded in color. The subtitles are screwed up. it's only in stereo, the commantary is the usual crap, the Toxic interviews would only entertain the die hard fan, they would put everyone else to sleep, Clips from the Anthology Film Archives screening of the movie is a snore, Watch the Naked Dance of the Damned Fat is just a dumb extra added, Absorb the Radiation March is a stupid thing put on every Troma DVD, Visit the Troma Treasure Chest is something that has potential to advertise there gift store, but it's just not funny, Learn to TromaDance is for the dumn at heart, The Mutant Slide Show old-school style is a bunch of pics and cover arts, Where in the World Is Toxie is hardly diffrent from the one on the 1st TA DVD, i didn't even bother going through them all.... the bonus features are pretty weak.. some outtakes & Deleted scenes are badly needed, but unfortunalty none exsist because they where thrown away.

If your a fan of Toxie and want this to complete the collection, then theres no stopping you from buying it, but otherwise, look for it in the cheapie bin or rent it, it's ok, and watchable again and again, but it's not as classic or as strong as part 1, 2 & 4's directors cuts.",1120003200,,2299,4.254004576659039
437587,4,6302181461,"What a great idea... after Toxie cleans up Tromaville and makes it a ""nice place to live"" where people are happy and dance like idiots in the streets, who's left for Toxie to oppose? Well, how about THE DEVIL!!! For those that don't know the story behind parts II and III, it was originally supposed to be one movie. The ony problem is that after it was completed it turned out to be something like 6 hours long! So the directer decided to chop the film in half and trim it down to two seperate movies. This explains the continuity problems and the fact that Part III seems to have such a weak plot. It's really just the end of one long movie. Personally I would have liked to see it as a 6 hour epic, but that's just me. So anyway, the themes of evil big business conglomerates being represented by satan is taken literally this time around. Now we find out that the Chairman of Apocalypse Inc (whom you'll remember from part II) is actually Old Nick himself (i.e. Satan) trying to pollute the planet and control the people. Of course we all know who wins. With the help of non other than the Good Lord, Toxie mashes satan. I would say to ignore those advising to steer clear of this movie. I found it to be, while not quite as good as I and II, a good, fun little movie.",1097625600,,1272,4.238683127572016
437588,1,6302181461,"As much as I like Troma films, this movie was seriously disappointing.  As a fan of the first two films in the Toxic Avenger series I was expecting a lot more from this third installment.  Instead, this movie is a large step backwards from the previous two.  The acting is horrible, the fight scenes are awful, and the plot is lacking.
  And it features one of the worst endings ever.  The ""videogame"" showdown makes little to no sense.  Regardless of whether or not you're a Troma fan I recommend steering clear of this one.",1044057600,3,525,4.5212765957446805
437589,2,6302181461,"I laughed a lot to the first TOXIC AVENGER, I laughed a little more to the second TOXIC AVENGER. I may have laughed about twice during the third TOXIC AVENGER. That's right! It's that boring. I assume only a ten year old would like this film. I know I didn't. Again it's nothing like the original, but it's exactly like the second.
What I don't get, is why Apocalypse Inc. is back after Toxie eliminated them. Bringing them back was very unoriginal. They shouldn't even have a crime business in this one, because the first one didn't. The first one was the only one that was a bit realistic.
The only funny part is what Toxie does with a criminal's intestines at the beginning. And the only fight scene worth watching, is the ending. But the ending isn't that great either. That's how bad this film is.
During the film, stars of the movie admit they're in the movie. Not saying that, that is stupid, because there are movies like that. But, the first one didn't mention anything like that, so why should the second?
It just looks as if the directors Michael Herz, and Lloyd Kaufman didn't even try on improving this film. It looks like they were just looking for a few bucks to put in their pocket.
The jokes are old in this one, not that there are many of those in them anyway, but I noticed they stole a joke from the first TOXIC AVENGER hoping people wouldn't notice. For example, the mother being gruesome joke. The actors also can't even make the joke sound funny. The original actor who told that joke made it sound hilarious.
I sure hope CITIZEN TOXIE: THE TOXIC AVENGER PART IV is worth watching when it comes out. I'm hoping that it will be more like the first TOXIC AVENGER.
This film is pretty rare, and the video store I got it at, was the only video store that I've seen it at. So if you feel like this movie is something you need to see, then go ahead and rent it, because that may be your only chance to get it. But don't be a bonehead, and go buy it. Wait to see what you think about it.
I hope my long review was helpful to you!",1000598400,2,2045,4.27319587628866
437590,4,6302181461,Toxic Avenger 3 is my second favorite in the series of three. (soon to be four) The toxic avenger 1 is the best in the series number 2 is the worst because none of the same cast returned and toxies face looked better in the first one and it was boring with toxies woiceover. The third one has some stupid voiceovers but not a lot also some scenes went on way too long. But something they did improve is the gore. In part 2 the gore was replaced with cartoon violence but in part 3 it wasn't cartoony like when he rips out the guys intestine and skip ropes with it. Some other things I like was that it had the same cast even from the first like cirgirface. It even had somethings the first had like toxie wareing the pilon on his head and that joke about mother in laws. All in all toxie 3 was an improvment over part 2 but not better than the first I just hope the fourth ones as good or better than the first.,999388800,,911,4.038674033149171

437592,5,6302181461,"I absolutely love this movie!  I admit, it's not as good as the other two movies, but it's still funny in its own right.  For example, one of my  favorite parts was when Toxie ripped out a guy's small intestine, then  jumped rope with the intestine!  I like that part a lot!  However, even I  think there were some parts of the movie that were unnecessary.  For  example, Toxie, a.k.a the Toxic Avenger, takes the hand of one bad guy and  grinds it in the gears of a tape erasing machine until the poor guy's arm  is little more than a stubb!  And to make matters worse, we could see the  guy's arm getting ground up!  I tell you, that was a scene that I think the  movie could have done without.  Other than that, the movie was great!  Trust me, if you're into nudity, lots of gruesome deaths, and corny jokes,  then this is the movie for you!",966211200,,844,4.20125786163522

This film may not be as good, in my opinion, as the first and second, but it is still better than the IV: Citizen Toixe. At least this film is easy to follow. It has a nice mix of madcap, titties, gore, and galore.
