8160278,4,B000L6EP2C,"This is a delightful but short (35 min.) DVD celebrating the diverse and beautiful world of butterflies.  Scientific info as well as mythologies about these delicate yet hardy creatures is here, as well as stunning images of newborns emerging from their pupas and adults migrating thousands of miles.  I'd never seen some of the butterflies featured here other than in books, and the narrative as well as the photography truly bring you ""up close and personal"" with these little wonders.

Is the price a bit steep for what you get?  Yes.  I was lucky to get a cheap copy from a subsidiary seller through Amazon, but wouldn't be able to justify paying $[...] bucks this.  There aren't any extras on the disk, either (rather a disappointment as I'd hoped for further info on a Butterfly Museum in Canada shown in the film.)  It's the reason I only gave the DVD 4 stars; it's simply overpriced for what you get.

But if you can score a cheap copy like I did, you won't be disappointed with the production quality and lovely profiles of butterflies large and small.  A cheerful half-hour experience for both young and old.",1278374400,,1118,4.6923076923076925
8160279,5,B000L6EP2C,"Although this DVD is only 30 minutes long, it is a beautiful and informative homage to butterflies in all their glory.  Little people will enjoy this DVD as much as big ones!",1277424000,,174,4.4375
