8191694,5,B000PHX8UC,"If well behaved women rarely make history, outrageous women often get edited out of history. This video will reframe 19th C women's history for you through the amazing story of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to have a stock brokerage on Wall Street, the first woman to run for president of the US, the first woman to address a joint Congressional committee, and the first woman to be 'thrown under the bus' by the Suffragists for her 'free love' morality.

Hers would be a story for the tabloids of today - a woman born into a family of snake oil peddlers - a spiritualist who ran sances - a vocal proponent of women's rights and free love - a presidential candidate jailed on the eve of election day, arrested and jailed for printing 'obscenities' in her newspaper.  What was her obscenity?  In response to a heated public moral crusade waged against her by the extremely popular and charismatic minister, Henry Ward Beecher, Woodhull pointed out in an article the hypocrisy of Beecher's tirades against her, considering that he himself was having an affair with one of his parishioners. The details of that revelation landed her and her sister in the Tombs!

There's so much more to the colorful and, even by today, scandalous story of Woodhull's life.  This video presents it all wonderfully.  For more, read Marge Piercy's excellent historical novel ""Sex Wars.""",1284249600,,1369,4.854077253218884
8191695,1,B000PHX8UC,"Victoria Woodhull was a fascinating woman.  This doc. is told with still photos (using the same over and over) and shoddy ambient sound to spruce it up.  Capshaw's voice over doesn't help much, nor do the interviews with historians and steinem.  I wanted to like it, but felt ripped off by it's price -  it felt like a film school project.",1220745600,,339,4.508196721311475
8191696,5,B000PHX8UC,"Every school girl needs to watch this, a fascinating documentary, with first class production values.  The road from Victoria Woodhull to Hillary's run for President is a rich full history, and it all began with Victoria Woodhull.  Every school and college library should have this excellent DVD.  I enjoyed it so much, and find myself inspired and in awe that someone so remarkable would have dared to - not just run for US President, but also to become the first woman on Wall Street.  She challenged authority and the status quo in a way that makes all women proud.  Buy this one for the young girl you love the most, and let it sink in - as her own inspiration as to how much farther she can go in life.",1196640000,12,707,4.407692307692308
8191697,4,B000PHX8UC,"This is a long overdue documentary about Victoria Woodhull.  The interviews are engaging, serious and captivating.  There is much presented in this documentary about Woodhull I had forgotten, such as the infamous BEECHER TILTON TRIAL, it was the trial of the century and Woodhull nearly brought the famous Rev Henry Ward Beecher down.  Another issue, is that Victoria Woodhull was arrested under the same law as Margaret Sanger, the Comstock Law for printing obscenities.  Imagine if today, someone enforced the same laws!  This is a well told story about a gutsy woman who, came from nothing and rose to the New York Society scene, to be the first woman to address the House Judiciary Committee, the first woman on Wall Street and to run for US President - 4 times.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/America-s-Victoria-Remembering-Victoria-Woodhull-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000PHX8UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">America's Victoria, Remembering Victoria Woodhull (Director's Cut~ Two Disc - Collector's Edition)</a>",1188950400,8,1078,6.458333333333333
8191698,5,B000PHX8UC,"What an amazing story!  Until now I had never heard of Victoria Woodhull, much less any of her worthy accomplishments.  She was the first woman to run for US President in 1872 (she nominated herself 4 times total) when women didn't even have the right to vote!  I throughly enjoyed the interviews with Gloria Steinem and the history professors.  An inspiring story well told, well thought out.
