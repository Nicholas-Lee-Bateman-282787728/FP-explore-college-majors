It enhances self-esteem and positive self-concept. The children remained attentive throughout and wanted to watch it again. ""Everybody loves Arthur. I was afraid when he was lost."" Some parts were scary. ""It taught us things. I learned that I have to pick up garbage. Lets go clean the playground."" Best for ages 2 to 5.",1000684800,,494,5.036585365853658
