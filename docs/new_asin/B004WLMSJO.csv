8445282,5,B004WLMSJO,Such a well presented & produced documentary! Worth your time and money. Every home should have this DVD to watch and learn about the bears! Casey Anderson is doing great things. NatGeo is really serving the purpose of educating the public about our furry friends and nature overall. LOVED it.,1316649600,8,293,4.88
