2404649,5,B000B7MXFC,"having enjoyed some of these videos online, i ordered this the moment i realized it was available.  it's not for everyone, but shaye saint john was a very special genius.  the menus on the dvd are extremely aggravating to use, and it doesn't seem to contain ALL of the videos i've seen online, but if you're even looking at this page, you need to just do yourself a favor and order it...",1357603200,,387,4.361111111111111

2404651,5,B000B7MXFC,"If you're one of those horror fans who always feels let down at the end of a scary movie because it just wasn't intense enough, this is the DVD for you.

Imagine taking acid and playing an old Barbara Streisand LP on 45 while eight friends stand around you in a circle wearing clown masks, twirling around in circles, and screaming at the top of their lungs.

Now imagine doing all of that under a strobe light with a police siren going off in the background, and you're still not even close to touching the level of insanity that is Shaye Saint John.",1289260800,23,551,4.339805825242719

2404653,1,B000B7MXFC,"If you ever have guests at your house and you want them to leave, put this on. They will leave immediately and never come back, especially if you tell them that this is perhaps the greatest video artist working today.

At Halloween, I like to play it on a monitor in my window. No one comes near the door.

This video will also help you rid your home of rats, mice, squirrels, gophers, badgers, capybaras, Republicans, and other vermin.

Highly recommended.",1220572800,8,457,4.617283950617284
2404739,3,B000B7MXFC,"I bought this looking for bizarre entertainment and it certainly delivered the first of those two criteria. It is great for both starting and ending conversations with house guests. As bizarre as this DVD is, I can't watch it as entertainment. This is why I give it 3 stars.",1439942400,,274,4.612244897959184

2404741,5,B000B7MXFC,"For my money, this (given a twenty year jump into the future) will become a pinnacle of not only underground filmmaking at it's finest, but also of the horror genre in general. This collection of short films labelled ""Triggers"" by Saint John is a TRUE video nightmare that cannot be surpassed in it's marriage of dark humor and the complete grotesque. It is creepy, unsettling, unhinged and hilarious. It makes you realize what a no-brain, faulty piece of crap ""Trash Humpers"" was. This collection of films (like most transcendent horror outings) also has a lot to say about contemporary culture - touching on celebrity worship, consumerism, plastic surgery, mental illness and handicap, reality TV, attention spans, addictions, mania and poverty. You will be unnerved, coupled with your uncomfortable laughter. The DVD contains at least twenty of these horrific shorts using costumes, surrealism and dolls to tell the bizarre life story of disfigured former super-model Shaye Saint John (one of the most truly original and shocking character monsters ever invented for film) You won't be bored. Shaye Saint John also employs a variety of harsh noises and experimental video techniques to keep you on your toes. It's a shame this creative force is deceased. hopefully a new Shaye video is in in the works, because there are probably another dozen ""Triggers"" floating around on YouTube that were created between the publishing of this DVD and Shaye's demise. I outright recommend a purchase - lest this title goes out of print.",1419465600,4,1526,5.132530120481928

2404747,5,B000B7MXFC,"Hello again!  This is the Shaye Saint John DVD.  Don't buy it unless you know what you're in for.  The only reason you should be reading this review is because you are already GOING to buy it.

Will also mention that most (but not all) of the shorts on this DVD can be found online, but at least you're watching it at the highest ""quality"" that is possibly available.",1384992000,9,367,4.27536231884058
2404748,4,B000B7MXFC,"About an hour ago I bought a cheap bottle of wine for my enchanted evening with Shaye Saint John, and BOY was it ever enchanted.
Thanks to Tosh. 0 (which is usually just recycled memes and photos from about two or three years ago) I happened upon the frenetic and wonderfully disturbing world of Shaye Saint John. My initial reaction to 'Hand Thing' was - 'Wow. That is THE most unsettling two minutes of video I have EVER seen.' And if you knew me, you would know that I am a card-carrying connoisseur of the weird, the depraved, and the unwatchable. It would be an understatement to say that SSJ was the sort of thing I had been waiting for my whole life.
The Triggers Compilation unfortunately did not feature a couple of my favorite videos (Hand Thing and the Drip Drop Diet) but it did feature some material I hadn't experienced yet. 'Experience' is the key word here. You do not WATCH SSJ videos, you EXPERIENCE them.

SSJ made me realize that I seem to be drawn to masked/disfigured faces. What this means, I may never know. I love Les Yeux Sans Visage-a 1960 french horror flick featuring a masked/disfigured woman, I am entranced by the final scenes from David Lynch's Inland Empire in which the main character's face is superimposed by two faces that I cannot even BEGIN to describe, then there's Kobo Abe's Face of Another in which a disfigured man dons a very human mask and even sleeps with his own wife under the guise. Perhaps it is my wish to be someone else? I like that it is, for me, a comment on our unattainable standard of female beauty- that the women advertised in the media are so perfect that their faces could almost be masks... (Hint, look up 'Uncanny' on Wikipedia.)

It is also (to me) a note on our exponentially ethnocentric and fast-driven American culture, which glorifies overabundance, superficial beauty and wealth, and a devil-may-care attitude about who gets stepped on in the process of attaining these goals.
(The trick is, you can't actually attain them! Funny, huh! GAWD!)

For those of us who appreciate absurdism (those who do not perhaps still have faith that the powers that be will take care of everything, and in some ways I envy you.) will find SSJ a more in depth lesson on what we already had an inkling of- that life doesn't make any sense, but it sure can be fun. (And scary.)",1366675200,5,2330,4.569377990430622
