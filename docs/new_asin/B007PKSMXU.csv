5103402,3,B007PKSMXU,"Funny that this is another name for the movie American Battleship that was filmed where we live in Wilmington, NC.  Perhaps the movie was re-distributed with the Battleship name for better marketing.  Regardless, it is a grade B movie filmed almost entirely on the Battleship North Carolina in Wilmington.  If you like Mario Van Peebles and Carl Weathers and want to see them in their more mature years and love to see naval scenes, including touring the Battleship North Carolina, then definitely buy this movie.  The plot was kind of campy, but the cinematography was well done.  One question the film never answered was why these space invaders were trying to get the world powers to fight each other in a nuclear conflict?  If you want a few laughs, this is worth a look.  However, it is nowhere in the same category as classics such as Midway, Tora Tora Tora, In Harms Way and other top tiered films.  For instance, I don't know who their military advisor was, but there was no way that 2 or 3 people could move those several hundred pound shells on a small cart for the big guns and no way a bunch of amateurs could learn to load and fire those big guns by reading a ship's manual in a few minutes study . Show this to today's sailors or a WWII veteran and they would get quite a chuckle.  But, to heck with logic, just enjoy the show and those good looking female Navy sailors and civilian historians on board!",1372204800,,1417,4.482490272373541

8520493,3,B007PKSMXU,"Big ship versus aliens.  It's fun to watch, but don't expect technical accuracy.  Acting, effects, plot, etc. are about what can be expected from SciFi channel movie.",1498694400,,166,5.111111111111111
8520494,4,B007PKSMXU,"This film is an Asylum mock-buster of the film ""Battleship"" and addresses some of the issues of that film, such as how does a Battleship welded to a pier suddenly has fuel and weapons? In this film the Enterprise (and task force) is up against an enemy with a cloaking device and the enemy has to become visible to fire its weapons. Where have we seen this before? We suspect the Chinese are involved. Now as any Trekkie knows the Romulans (not to be confused with Romney supporters) had such a device. Trekkies also know that the Romulans represented the Chinese. I love these movie tie-ins. Plus 1 star for a Star Trek tie-in.

What this film lacks, that ""Battleship"" possessed is a killer sound track, witty dialouge, and likeable characters. The USS Iowa is undergoing a world tour as a museum piece when the attacks occur. All solid state electronics are fried, so it is up to old technology and SEAL Team 6, who happens to be on board to save the planet. Mario Van Peebles is the captain of The Big Stick and has a love interest in Lt. Caroline Bradley (Johanna Watts) which is not fully developed. Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed) has a small role as General McKraken. David Polinsky starts out the film as a 4 star admiral and by the end of the film he is a three star admiral. Asylum normally confounds their naval ranking insignias. Not as good as ""Battleship."" The special CG effects are still Asylum grade, especially the fake looking fire on the deck of the ship.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Kid safe. 4 stars on the Asylum scale.",1449273600,2,1540,4.516129032258065

8520499,4,B007PKSMXU,"Captain has lots of character and good acting. Story keeps your interest and on your toes, best parts are some great shots of the real ship at sea although some poor animation and cheesy lines but as a whole well worth the price.",1423008000,,229,4.348837209302325
