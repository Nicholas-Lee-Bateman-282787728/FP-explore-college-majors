8196629,1,B000QKM0RK,I thought it would be a video of a waterfall out in the mountains.  It is a closeup video of a waterfall yard decoration done in someone's back yard.,1380758400,,149,4.137931034482759

8196631,5,B000QKM0RK,"I've had this DVD for years and really like it.  There is only one scene, but it is a pretty scene.  Small, pretty, blue, waterfall cascading over rocks with pretty flowers.  Now and then a butterfly flitting by.  You can choose water sound or music.  Forget the music, it's just someone strumming a guitar and not very good.  If you want music you're better off to mute the sound and listen to your own music. However, the water sound is great.  Very relaxing and great for drowning (no pun intended) out other sounds if you're trying to sleep during the day.",1339372800,,560,4.485148514851486
8196632,3,B000QKM0RK,"This is a stationary scene with moving water, and plants. It is ""living art"" as described however, I thought it would have more than one scene to choose from. Rocky Mountain Hideaway appears to be more like a tropical place such as Hawaii, from the horticulture, than any of the outdoor landscapes that I have seen in the Rocky Mountains. I grew up in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. I think it is relaxing and I like the music and nature sound options. You can either listen to music, music and nature or nature only. The picture is high quality and very picturesque. I will enjoy entertaining with this as a background scene or using the scenery for meditation or relaxation.",1266969600,,678,4.6115702479338845
