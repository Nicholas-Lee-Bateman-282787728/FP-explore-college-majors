8550880,5,B00AFEYID6,"I got my copy of this from the UK in January, when it became apparent that the US release would be delayed, as is often the case. It is the third in the relatively new Dresden Semperoper New Year's celebration concerts, intended, one might speculate, to create a bit of rivalry with the long standing Vienna New Year's Concert. It's a winner!

The first two of the Dresden series presented the music of Franz Lehar, with some Strauss waltzes thrown in for good measure. This disc features the music of Emmerich Kalman (1882 - 1953), who was regarded as one of the finest composers of operetta in the early 20th century. His best known works are Die Csardasfurstin (The Gypsy Princess) (1925) and Grafin Maritza (1924). His music emphasizes the ""Gypsy idiom"" , which he believed to be truly Hungarian, as well as the Viennese waltz. It is very melodic and intensely rythmic, as well as extremely romantic especially in the duets (as one might expect).

Some might consider this stuff as ... a bit out of touch with contemporary tastes in music, but as my bartender/psychologist keeps telling me, ""... it's OK if you have an arrested development insofar as your musical tastes are concerned ..."" (He should talk: HE likes Wagner!!) But I wallow in this kind of music! It's near total schmaltz, but it's very good schmaltz!

Soprano Ingeborg Schopf, who filled in ""at the last moment"" for an ailing Diana Damrau is the real deal. She was unknown to me before I got this disc, and has no other recordings, as far as I have been able to find. She is a lead soprano with the Dresden State Operetta and her performance shows it; she is totally ""at home"" with this repertory. She relies on the score in a couple of pieces, probably as a result of her late stand in status, but her voice is secure, clear, focused and lovely throughout the range.

Piotr Beczala is, IMHO, one of the top tenors on today's stage and he shines in this repertory (catch him in the Die Lustige Witwe (The Merry Widow) on Arthuas DVD, gentle reader). He has an awesome top, admittedly, but the rest of his voice is equally as superb, with impeccible technique. I didn't catch any women in the audience swooning, if such is even done any more, but if it happened, I'd not be surprised. Beczala sings the music as romantically as it is written

Maestro Christian Thielmann, a noted conductor of Wagner, is quite at home in the operetta world and has a lot of obvious fun in directing. There is the mandatory Struass waltz (An der Elbe) to ring down the curtain while ringing in the New Year.

Disc quality is superb, with clear and crisp picture, and amazing audio in the DTS mode. Subtitles are in English, German, French and Spanish.

Open a bottle of bubbly and enjoy! As I said, it's a winner!! I hope that DG keeps bringing us these lovely concerts.",1373673600,,2821,4.563241106719367
8550881,5,B00AFEYID6,"This is an excellent performance at every level.  The focus on the music of Emmerich Kalman may seem limiting, but he was a prolific composer of the late operetta period.  His music is melodic, versatile and remains exciting(many Hungarian folk themes for example).  The Dresden Staatskapelle under the direction of Christian Thielemann does a sensitive interpretation of the material.  The two soloists, Ingeborg Schopf and Pioir Beczala have a feel for the music and are in great voice.  The blue ray images are excellent.  The surround sound has great clarity and separation.  The program is in German but the subtitles are fine.  The performances come from the following shows: Grafin Mariza (one of the great operettas and one that deserves cross over into the current opera world), Die Csardasfurstin, Die Zirkusprinzessin, Kaiserin Josephine, Die Herzogin von Chicago, Das Veilchen von Montmartre and Der Zifeunerprimas.  Selections from Grafin Mariza predominate.  My only complaint (minor) is that the video director seemed a bit ""twitchy.""  The duration of each shot is very short and there are too many of what I call ""tonsil shots""(extreme close ups that show tongue and back of mouth during vocal passages).  I do not think that beads of sweat seen on extreme close ups of foreheads, for example, add to the vocal ambiance.",1371859200,2,1336,5.162790697674419
8550882,5,B00AFEYID6,"The new 'tradition' of New Year's Eve concerts celebrated in Dresden and conducted by Thielemann started in 2010. The first two focussed on the music of Lehar but for this 2012/2013 concert the focus has moved to the Hungarian, Kalman. Kalman was initially resident in Vienna and successfully blended the Viennese style of light music with his own Hungarian input which included links to the popular gypsy flavours of the time. His most popular music comes from this earlier period in his life. This disc offers a well-balanced and fairly comprehensive survey of his music. Only the final item departs from Kalman and is the An der Elbe waltz by Strauss which concludes the concert.

The concert essentially highlights arias sung by the two soloists with additional items played by the orchestra, sung by the choir and danced by the ballet company. Ingeborg Schopf makes a very fine job of replacing the indisposed Diana Damrau at the very last minute. She is the leading soprano of the Dresden State Operetta company and is obviously at home with the repertoire. Her voice is well able to cope with the demands placed upon it in her four solo arias and also in the fifth piece, where she leads the chorus. She also partners Piotr Beczala in four duets with suitable aplomb.

The chorus are featured in three pieces and sing with gusto and enthusiasm plus some energetic gypsy clapping! The ballet sequence takes the form of a mini-story in much the same way as is familiar with the regular Vienna New Year's Day concerts. The dancing is expertly done and the costumes are exquisite. The orchestra play extremely well throughout under the attentive and meticulous Thielemann, who became their principal conductor in September 2012.

Piotr Beczala, however, clearly steals the show with highly enthusiastic support from the packed audience after each of his five solo arias. He has an effortlessly clear voice, ideally suited to this music and which fills the hall with apparent ease. His manner is most attractively relaxed so his popularity is easily understood. This is his second appearance at these concerts and it is easy to understand why.

The HD recording has all the expected clarity and range of colour. The sound is presented in both DTS surround (default) and stereo. Subtitles are available in English, French and Spanish with the music being sung in the original German.

This is a most attractive light music concert and is well presented. If the program of music by Kalman appeals, I would suggest that this latest disc in the new 'tradition' from Dresden would be well worth considering.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

I have the 2011 concert and particularly enjoyed the performances by Ana Maria Labin. The german lyrics in translation to the song sung by Piotr Beczala we know as ""Girls were made to love and kiss"" be warned are rather more blunt and not as poetic. I did not care for the Oscar Strauss encore by Angela Denoke, dressed in a black trouser suit for a modern take on love. The song ""why not have an affair?"" was meant to be witty and frivolous but seemed more like something cynical from 'Cabaret' and was a bit of a downer after the romance of the former pieces.. (U.K. review)

Dear Angela, I agree with your comment about the Oscar Strauss piece - a strange choice for an encore. Of the three concerts so far I have enjoyed the second the most. (Full of Lehar without the Merry Widow). There is an excellent DVD of that operetta conducted by Welser-Most which you may enjoy. Best wishes, Ian Giles

Dear Ian, I have the excellent DVD of the Merry Widow to which you refer, much enjoyed by all the family. A delight.. (U.K. review)",1359504000,8,3749,4.8346333853354135
