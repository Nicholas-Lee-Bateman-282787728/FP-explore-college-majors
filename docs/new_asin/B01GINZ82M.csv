7760258,5,B01GINZ82M,"The 2016 Seattle International Film Festival welcomed this entry from Australia that features the legendary (three-time Academy-Award winning) fashion designer, Orry-Kelly. (born Orry George Kelly in Kiama, Australia).  It is Nirvana for fans of movies, celebrity insider information and just plain gossip. In addition, Director Gillian Armstrong (""Oscar and Lucinda""), working with screenwriter Katherine Thomson (LOTS of TV), has concocted a delicious peek at 30s, 40, and 50s Hollywood.

This audaciously clever docu-drama boasts a combination of newsreels, studio clips, and movie bits, plus scripted pieces using actors who occasionally fill in for celebrities. There are interviews and stars' endorsements, studio publicity photos, gossip columnists and old home movies. (Oh, did I mention gorgeous clothes?)

We learn about our hero's move to the US in the 30s, sharing space and life with Archie Leach. If that name sounds familiar, it should. That was Cary Grant's name before the movie studio changed it.

We watch an actor cleverly inhabit Orry-Kelly's persona, usually in a rowboat named after his hometown, Kiama.. He efficiently fills us in on his first work (as a failed actor), his being drafted into the Army at age 46 (and soon ""un-drafted""), and his move into costumes. We see Busby Berkeley's kaleidoscopic choreography (inspired by the military), plus scenes from ""Casablanca,"" ""An American in Paris,"" ""Some Like it Hot,"" ""Auntie Mame,"" ""Les Girls,"" ""Oklahoma,"" ""Irma la Douce,"" ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" and countless Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck films. Always narrated by a voice representing Orry-Kelly from his book; and Archie Leach often moves in and out of the picture.

There is a very forthright segment of the film that talks about Cary Grant and Randolph Scott, their marriages and the gossip that constantly surrounded them. And we can count on a generous helping of wry humor to move things along.

Orry-Kelly worked on 285 films during the course of his Hollywood career and his battles with Jack Warner were legendary (but he kept working for him).

Believe it or not, I have only touched on part of this delightful film. The interviews with his mother (always at her clothesline) are funny, although her advice is terrible!

I enjoyed it because it's a cineast's nirvana and I have pre-ordered my copy from Amazon.",1466726400,14,2353,5.256
7760259,5,B01GINZ82M,Love this!!!  Great story!!  Great man!!,1493769600,,40,5.5
7760260,5,B01GINZ82M,"It's a great Bio-Pic.  I didn't know Orry-Kelly won 3 Oscars for Wardrobe Design,  That's one heck of an accomplishment.",1490486400,,120,4.95
7760261,5,B01GINZ82M,"This was such an unexpected and entertaining documentary. I would have appreciated more without the ""faux-characters"" playing out the parts of Orry & his mom, rather than just narrating, & supportive cast adding their own personal commentary and memories. What an amazing contribution Orry made to the film & artist community, and what a legacy of collective work he has left behind. Very sad to discover how he was ignored and treated by Archie aka ""Cary Grant"" who obviously was probably miserable and inwardly broken by his closeted life, though outwardly seeming to have it all. Neil Patrick Harris is an actor who is a testament to being able to live an ""out"" life in hollywood, and separate his personal life from his professional. What a brave, groundbreaking person Orry was! I'm so happy I discovered who the talented human being was behind some of my favorite stars, and timeless classic movies. A story to be shared not only to discover the artist, but also to shed light on the lie that Cary Grant chose to live.",1484956800,2,1024,4.790960451977401
7760262,5,B01GINZ82M,"A terrific biography of Australian-born Hollywood costume designer (and 3 time Oscar winner) Orry-Kelly. Gillian Armstrong's fun and emotional look at Kelly's often challenging life includes wonderful taking heads; actresses like Jane Fonda and Angela Landsbury, great designers of the more modern era like Ann Roth and Catherine Martin, film and Hollywood historians like Leonard Maltin and others. They tell absorbing stories about the wildly talented, sometimes wildly difficult perfectionist, as well as heartbreaking ones about his personal life as a gay man in Hollywood at a time when being 'out' was still cause for possible unemployment and human banishment. These attitudes and threats led to  among other things - a terribly painful and ultimately cruel break-up of many years from his early lover and one time best friend Archie Leach, later known as Cary Grant.

But what makes the documentary much more interesting than most Hollywood hagiographies are the more theatrical elements Armstrong and screenwriter Katherine Thompson bring to the party. Along with the great stories, clips and still photos there are also actors playing Kerry (an excellent Darren Gilshenan), his mother and others from his life. Kerry enthusiastically narrates his own story in the midst of wonderfully surreal, theatrical and playfully symbolic settings (rowing alone in a tiny boat is a constant metaphor). These sequences paradoxically bring both lightness and depth to the film, giving us a far more personal connection to the man than most screen biographies have. In the end it's both a lot of fun and tremendously sad and informative about the sexual and human politics of Hollywood, and their costs on real human beings (not only gay men, but women both straight and gay as well).

One of those films I almost didn't see since it's not a subject that called out for me, only to be very happily surprised at how much I got out of it.",1483142400,,1932,5.146496815286624

7760268,2,B01GINZ82M,"The sad but true story is  it had all the earmarks of being great bui it STUNK! It was a tour of the designers life and loves and idiocynracies but not much of the reason I wanted to see it. Hollywood Glamor woman.

7760269,5,B01GINZ82M,Really highly creative expose on this man's life.,1476576000,,49,5.25
7760270,5,B01GINZ82M,"I'm ashamed to say I had no idea who Orry Kelly was. Since the name is often hyphenated, I assumed he was a corporation. Must see for movie buffs and fashionistas. (It's worth it just to see the struggle with Bette Davis' breasts!)",1476144000,,231,4.395348837209302

7760272,4,B01GINZ82M,"This is an enjoyable silly and sweet sort of documentary. Actors portray the main characters, Orry Kelly, his Mom, Carry Grant etc. There is narration and glamour and it's always a little sad to find that people who's lives seem so fantastic have the same old problems and can have their careers pulled out from under them  when they just fall out of fashion.  Kelly's career crashed and then came back stronger than ever up to the time of his death.  Cigarettes!!",1475625600,2,464,4.634146341463414
7760273,5,B01GINZ82M,I rate this movie one of the top ten of all time.  Extremely entertaining movie/documentary about a costume designer that I did not know anything about until this movie.  Wonderful.  Must see!,1473206400,,192,4.9375
7760274,5,B01GINZ82M,"I'm a huge fan of classic movies and I loved this documentary about fashion designer Orry-Kelly. He dressed all the greatest stars of the 1930s and 1940s - Bette Davis, Kay Francis, Ingrid Bergman, and Marilyn Monroe. He won three Academy Awards! His personal life was even more fascinating. He was openly gay and the great love of his life was Cary Grant!!! This documentary focuses a LOT of time on Cary. He was in the closet and he broke Orry's heart. This documentary is based on Orry's unpublished autobiography so I believe it's true. They don't sugarcoat Orry's battle with alcoholism which he won after going to rehab in the 1950s. I hope film fans watch this documentary and become a fan of Orry. He was an important part of Hollywood history.",1473206400,,752,4.661654135338346
7760275,3,B01GINZ82M,"This was an interesting film to watch, but had to skip the portions with Hanoi Jane.  As they say, ""I'll forgive Jane Fonda when the Jews forgive Hitler.""  Not only for her behavior during the war, but also for her being unapologetic throughout the years.  I've talked to several Vietnam Vets, some of whom were POW's, and it is so sad to hear how her presence there with the enemy affected their lives during that time.",1472947200,2,420,4.5

7760277,5,B01GINZ82M,"First, you have to be like me and love anything from the Golden Age of Hollywood and Orry-Kelly was very much a part of that era.  The way his life and accomplishments are presented is a hoot.  A great movie documentary with plenty of photos, old film and snooty gossip.  Loved it.",1472774400,2,281,4.365384615384615
7760278,4,B01GINZ82M,loved the true documentary but the dramatized parts were very contrived.,1472428800,,72,5.636363636363637

8762964,1,B01GINZ82M,"Very disappointed in this film, it is mainly just gossip and speculation about Cary Grant's sexuality, not much about the clothes the designer made.",1515110400,,148,5.208333333333333
8762965,4,B01GINZ82M,Fascinating subject but I didn't like the actor as narrator trope.  I wish it had just been a straight (no pun intended!) documentary.,1513123200,,134,4.826086956521739

8762969,3,B01GINZ82M,"I stumbled across this film while looking for a book by Sylvia, personal trainer to the stars  - around the time that Orry-Kelly was in Hollywood, in fact.

I am not a serious student of film but I do spend quite a lot of time reading the memoirs, biographies, and histories of Hollywood. I stumbled across this title while searching for a book by Madame Sylvia, personal masseuse to the stars (also, apparently, a kind of personal trainer). She lived in the area of Hollywood around the same time as Orry-Kelly, I believe.

It's an intriguing look at the star colony of that time. I think that Orry-Kelly was intimidated by the greatness of these stars, and more in awe of them than he let on with his bravado (or flamboyance). The comment he made about Bette Davis' breasts being floppy was just the kind of gossip I was looking for. And the flat chest that tiny Natalie Wood sported. It gives you hope when you know that the glamour of these gorgeous women was at least in part manufactured.

The director Gillian Armstrong deals a low blow to Cary Grant - one that he doesn't deserve - when she continually harps on Orry-Kelly's obvious wishful thinking about Grant, who was his roommate. Grant had a huge problem that tells volumes about his childhood and upbringing. He was very cheap and mean about money. He actually gave Orry-Kelly bills demanding payment whenever he met him for a meal and ended up paying. But Orry-Kelly certainly got what he wanted from that arrangement (He said, 'He came home to me' - technically true but really?) - his brush with destiny. Who even knows who Orry-Kelly was, even with this film?

Turns out - many people know who Orry-Kelly was. Some because they would like to think there is some substance to the rumors that smear Grant's reputation. After all, Grant was a giant of the cinema. Of all the costume designers, Orry-Kelly will not likely be remembered as easily as Joe Schmoe remembers the name 'Edith Head.' All of his talent and craft are on display in his films. This, for a costume designer, has to be the greatest thing because it's' a legacy.

His snarky catty innuendo? About Grant? Rack it up to the fact that he was alcoholic. That he felt bitter about some things (while happy about others, in particular his boyfriend Bob Roberts). That he may have realized that there is much more fame in being a talented actor than a talented designer.

In an article that appeared in the Guardian (U.K.) written by Alexandra Spring (June 12, 2015):

'But the director confesses theyd hoped to find a much-gossiped about memoir the costume designer was rumoured to have been writing. In it, Kelly was said to spill the beans on his long-standing but secret friendship with actor Cary Grant. Their relationship is at the heart of the film. Its a story about friendship and loyalty, says Armstrong. Its a story about two young mates starting out and helping each other, its about fame, money, power and homophobia.

Of course, Armstrong can't have thought that there was a 'secret' friendship. There was no hiding where you lived or who your friends are in that industry-driven town of Hollywood. The writer of the Guardian article was wiser than Gillian and didn't stress that the film indulges in sordid gossip about Grant's sexuality - in the movie going so far as to label him Orry-Kelly's boyfriend. Let's overlook that glaring error, I can imagine the writer saying to the editor. It would be open season on anyone who ever had a roommate of the same sex!

Poor Randolph Scott. Gillian does the same to him, allowing one person on camera to say that Scott left his home because he was gay - and came to California. Scott and his wife of 42 years adopted 2 children. Of course, he was Grant's roommate, too. They adopted children. Hmmmm. It all adds up. 42 years of living a lie! Read the Wikipedia entry for Randolph Scott to hear his closest relative 'tell all' - and then go back and listen to Orry-Kelly's comments.

One of the best things about this documentary, to me, was the inclusion of Jane Fonda. What a beauty at her age today!",1498348800,2,4087,4.6312154696132595
