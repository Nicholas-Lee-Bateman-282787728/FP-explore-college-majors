4386782,4,B004IK30PA,"Jennifer Aniston, America's Sweetheart! At an age (40+), when most actresses no longer play romantic leads, she shines radiantly and acts with ever increasing depth. She still looks hot to me.

Now her character Kassie, well, .... She's successful, intelligent, and pigheaded. While she is busy becoming successful, her biological alarm clock goes BONG. There is a famous Sufi story of a man who rode as fast as he could from one side of Arabia to the other in search of his horse, only to realize at the end he was riding on it! In this somewhat formulaic romantic comedy Kassie doesn't realize her somewhat sensitive shy BBF and confidant is actually a good choice as the husband she wants. She wants to have a baby and she won't let not being married stand in the way. Justin Bateman plays the introverted BBF Wally. As you watch this, you want to shake both of them and say ""wake up and look around you"".  Kassie is infuriatingly independent, to her own detriment. Just as Bateman is shy, to his... But that's where the comedy and plot is, without giving too much away.  Kassie finds she has underestimated the difficulty of raising a son without a father, she needs more than a turkey baster...Thomas Robinson plays Sebastian, the shy funny and neurotic son from a young actor who will be seen again.  Certainly a comedy for a modern age. This movie will doubtless be seen by more women than men but it shouldn't be, it has a lot to say about men and fatherhood.

It's not ""Citizen Kane"", but it is witty, warmhearted and touching and Aniston shows more depth with each new role.",1282435200,4,1584,4.602836879432624
4386783,5,B004IK30PA,"The movie isn't your typical chick flick as it  focuses more on Wally's bond with his son, Sebastian than Wally's love for Kassie. I found the movie both touching and humorous.

Thomas Robinson does an excellent job at playing Sebastian.

Overall, an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone wanting to see a good heartfelt, humorous comedy.",1282348800,2,349,4.982758620689655
4386784,3,B004IK30PA,"A few months ago, I was especially harsh on ""The Back-Up Plan,"" a rotten little romantic comedy about a woman who decides to get herself artificially inseminated. Now we have ""The Switch,"" which is about the same thing. It's an improvement, although not by much, I'm sorry to say. That's because it makes slightly smaller versions of the exact same mistakes: It takes an engaging idea and robs it of just about anything meaningful, leaving behind a series of jokes that are stretched to the breaking point. It gets off to a promising start, but it slowly goes downhill, and it often rides over bumps and potholes that threaten to throw the whole thing off course. We then reach an ending so conventional, it's practically a wet blanket. Given the choice between the two, I'd rather you see ""The Switch."" Given any choice, I'd rather you miss both.

Adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides' short story ""Baster,"" ""The Switch"" is founded on a premise the ads have given away but I feel obligated to keep secret. That will make it awfully difficult to describe, although I think I'd be doing a favor for those who have managed to avoid the ads. Taking place in New York City, it tells the story of Kassie (Jennifer Aniston), who wants to have a baby but is tired of waiting around for Mr. Right. She decides to have herself artificially inseminated. Her neurotic best friend of many years, Wally (Jason Bateman), is against the idea, especially after meeting her sperm donor, the handsome, charming, athletic Roland (Patrick Wilson). The deed is done at, of all places, an insemination party hosted by Kassie's outrageous girlfriend, Debiet (Juliette Lewis).

Part of the problem is that Wally has never had the nerve to admit to Kassie his feelings for her. Wally's work buddy, Leonard (Jeff Goldblum), makes it clear that he missed his chance to make his move, that she has officially put him into a ""friend zone.""

Years pass. Kassie has given birth to a son, Sebastian. They live for a while in Minnesota, Kassie's home state. Then they return to New York, giving Wally the chance to meet Sebastian. This is the point at which the review will become annoyingly vague. I can say that little Sebastian (Thomas Robinson) is one of the most unrealistic child characters of recent memory; he says and does things no child would ever say or do. He forms a relationship of sorts with Wally, and the two share conversations that real adults and children would never, ever have. Their dialogue, their general togetherness, is so awkward and strained that I never once believed the two could ever bond. If you're reading this and you already know the secret I'm so desperately trying to keep hidden, you should understand why I feel this way. Honestly, has there been a more implausible adult/child pairing of any movie this year?

The overall tone of the film is odd. Not pleasantly odd, but odd in that creepy, underhanded way that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Part of this stems from the performances, which are decent enough but lack any real depth. Goldblum in particular is his usual one-note self, delivering every line with the exact same volume and emotional range. He has relied on this persona for far too long. Wilson's character smiles a lot and seems likeable, and yet there's always something about him that makes you think he's about ready to snap. Every scene with him is an exercise in tension, and not the good kind you would see in a Hitchcock film. He just made me feel ... uncomfortable. I can't quite put my finger on it. If you see the film, maybe you'll understand where I'm coming from.

As for Juliette Lewis' character, all I can say I'm glad she was given such little screen time. Lewis is a wonderful actress, but here she seems remarkably out of place, a woman I could never imagine someone like Kassie being friends with. She's irritating. She's bizarre. She would be someone you would talk about behind her back, not necessarily with hostility, but definitely with the certainty that something isn't quite right about her.

So there you have it. I've managed to avoid describing the crux of the story, a secret that pretty much everyone already knows about. Needless to say, the title does more than its fair share of spoiling the plot. Such a shame. Individually, there are recommendable things about ""The Switch."" Bateman's character, annoyingly hung-up though he may be, lends a certain charm to the story that cuts though a lot of the oddness. And Aniston's character, while fairly straightforward, is played competently enough for us to care about her. But as a whole, the film just doesn't hit the right notes; it plays like a symphony with a section off key. Perhaps if the filmmakers had rethought Robinson's character and his interactions with Bateman, there might have been something here worth seeing.",1282262400,2,4849,4.773539928486294

Fast forward almost 6 years to when she returns to NYC with her very intelligent, very precocious son, who oddly looks and acts *a lot* like Bateman.  But that can't be because she's tracked down the sperm donor, a total jerk to all but Aniston, and they've become engaged.  No surprise that the son can't stand the guy even though he's (supposedly) his birth father, and keeps finding ways to spend time with Bateman, whom he adores.

What could be just another cheesy, sappy chick flick is instead elevated to a smart and funny movie by the presence of Bateman, Aniston and the child actor who plays the son, Sebastion.",1511568000,,873,4.7105263157894735

the plot

Wally Mars is best friends with his ex girlfriend Kassie Larson. The two live and work in NYC, and they see each other and talk to each other on a regular basis, yet strictly as friends. The story starts off seven years ago when Kassie decided that her biological clock was dangerously close to running out and she wanted to be a mother. She confides in Wally that she wishes to find a sperm donor, but not through an agency. She wants to actually meet the person and make this artificial insemination as personable as possible. Wally thinks it's a bad idea, and the two kind of have a falling out over it.

Kassie finds a nice guy named Roland, who is married and has an ""I'm getting pregnant"" party. She invites Wally and he meets Roland, and then proceeds to get very drunk. Wally needs to use the bathroom, and as the front bathroom is occupied he finds the bathroom in the back bathroom. There, he finds Roland's specimen that will be inseminated into Kassie toward the end of the party. The drunken fool that he is, he begins playing with the jar, and accidentally dumps it down the sink. He then reasons that it's a good idea to replenish the specimen with his own ingredients.

Kassie then moves back home to Montana nearer to her mother and stays for seven years. She comes back to NYC and catches up with Wally again. Wally has no recollection of his drunken adventure from seven years ago, but slowly but surely begins to suspect something off about Kassie's son Sebastian. He is able to piece together the evidence from spending so much time with Sebastian, but becomes hesitant about telling Kassie the truth, in fear that she may never speak to him again and also take her son with her.

the breakdown

This film received an average of lukewarm reviews probably due to the fact that in some ways it feels like a lot of same old same old. Yet to feel this way, you'd have to overlook the relationship between Jason Bateman's Wally character and Sebastian played by Thomas Robinson. Although Aniston receives top billing here, The Switch feels like more of a vehicle for Bateman. The plot totally revolves around his character and he even narrates the film. Bateman's ownership of this role gives you unspoken impressions of the character's history. His every motivation is obviously hewn out of the love he feels for Kassie, although he is either oblivious to this fact, or he is a master at suppression. Yet when Sebastian comes around, his heart is forced to open up and accept more little by little.

I was a little torn on how I felt about Aniston's character Kassie. I felt like Wally, feeling the voice of reason, and asking as he did, ""what are you thinking' or think of how this is going to affect your life'. Kassie was a woman with a fiery determination to have a baby. It bothered me a bit that she had such blinders on, yet now that I think about it, it makes sense and it is romantic as well. She knew she had to settle for artificial insemination because her heart was with Wally as well, and he couldn't commit because of his neurotic tendencies and over analyzing of everything. Yet, the viewer is not sure that she knows this either; in the same way Wally was unaware of his feelings. So while Aniston may seem very one dimensional at first glance, if you care to look deeper you'll appreciate her performance as I do.

The obligatory BFFs were interestingly cast here. Juliette Lewis plays Debbie best friend to Kassie, it felt a bit awkward athe switchs the two seem total opposites and have little interaction with each other. Jeff Goldblum is another one of my favorite actors; he has a natural way about his humor. His friendship with Bateman seemed more natural than Aniston and Lewis, yet the 17-year age difference makes you wonder why these two are friends to begin with. Lewis' character was in the film only briefly, and sadly so was Goldblum. I would have liked to have more of him, yet even from the deleted scenes there were no additional scenes with the actor even planned.

Now, what of this crime that Wally takes part in. He ""hijacked her pregnancy"" and ruined lives (concerning Roland, the donor'), yet he seems to be rewarded with this son, a miniature version of himself who loves him. Was it the right thing to do? It was sneaky and underhanded. I feel that many movies reward bad behavior and this one is among the top. The movie was rated PG-13 mostly because of the sexual nature of the whole insemination thing and the visual of the ""donation."" There was a minimal amount of bad language and with the relationship between Wally and Sebastian makes it feel almost like a good family flick. I enjoyed this, 3 stars.

4386798,1,B004IK30PA,"Review for The Switch
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

I saw this movie twice, in hopes that the second viewing would raise my opinion of it. Unfortunately, with neither protagonist even remotely likable, and an underlying theme I just couldn't get on board with, I still didn't like The Switch.

A man is in love with his female friend, and when she decides to get artificially inseminated to experience motherhood, he switches her donated sperm sample with a sample of his own. His excuse? Hes drunk off his fanny and doesnt even remember it until years later when her child starts to resemble him. Im sorry, but thats absurd. And pretending for a moment that it isn't absurd, its despicable.

The movie cuts to ten years later after the insemination, but Jennifer Aniston doesnt age a day. At the start of the movie, she mentions her ticking clock, and that shes at that age when having kids is a now-or-never option. That places her anywhere from her late thirties through her mid-forties. Ten years later would mean shes supposed to be in her late forties or mid-fifties for the majority of the movie, but she still looks like a thirty-five-year-old.

Jason Bateman remembers his switch because Anistons child has behavioral traits similar to his own, which in the film is credited to his genetics, since he hasn't even seen the kid the first ten years of his life. Im a strict believer in nurture, rather than nature. I realize this is a highly controversial debate, and if you're a nature person, you might buy into the films argument. Obviously, I didnt.

If I was in the habit of giving spoilers in my reviews, I could rant about other problems I have with this movie. As it is, only one more can fit: Anistons character is made out to be a terrible mother, without the film ever hinting that she is. My hunch is that her character is supposed to make other terrible mothers in the audience feel normal, instead of inadequate. Id rather they be inspired to change, instead of encouraged to shrug and figure everyone else is just as incompetent.",1497225600,,2051,4.654696132596685

8430762,3,B004IK30PA,"My review contains spoilers...

Bateman had many chances to tell Aniston that he was the father of her child.  For dramatic and comedic purposes, the way it plays out here -- in front of a crowd of people -- was not very plausible.

The kid -- six years old -- takes leave of a party in NYC -- apparently unnoticed by the adults who would have been monitoring the party -- and finds his way to Bateman's apartment some 20 streets away (if I remember correctly from the movie)?  Again, not very plausible.

Overall, while the story wasn't too bad, it was just standard fare by the end.  Not great.  Not bad.  Middle of the road.  Three stars.",1520380800,,641,4.364406779661017
