5679213,1,B00BWDA84W,"Okay, guys, let's be honest here. We'll watch even awful horror if it involves semi-naked scenes of hot starlets. ""Blood Reunion"" may be the exception. I don't know what happens here because it was such dreck, I couldn't bear to watch. Based on the simplest logic, even the 15-years scenario was unbelievable. Unless a 5-year-old can become 35 in 15 years... Bad sci-fi/fantasy could excuse idiocy with naked breasts in the past.. but the Internet rendered that argument null long ago. Bottom line: Don't waste your time.",1424390400,2,521,5.0

5679216,4,B00BWDA84W,This was a good movie. Not bad at all for an indie film. The acting was good for the most part and the story moved along nicely. It held my attention all the way through to the end. I can recommend this as a good movie to watch for fans of vampire films.,1400630400,3,254,3.811320754716981
5679217,1,B00BWDA84W,Movie is to dark when I wanna see. The music is too loud when I wanna hear what is being said. Actors seem like they got too old to do porn. One fattie should become a vamp cause he must have lost his false teeth. The American mother has a terrible accent like Dracula (because she was bit?) The muscle guy is sappy in love country boy.,1380844800,,336,4.029850746268656
5679218,1,B00BWDA84W,I didn't like it at all. Boring and the acting was terrible. I love vampire movies but this one really sucked.,1378771200,,110,4.285714285714286
5679219,1,B00BWDA84W,"This was such a low budget film it was below sea level!. No sets, just filmed in a small town environment with actors that looked like anyone they could pull off the streets. Avoid like the plague!",1376006400,,197,4.351351351351352
5679220,1,B00BWDA84W,"this movie had poor acting, looks like it was shot with a home video camera and their are no special effects to make up for it. I was fast forwarding through the movie and found no good parts to speak of.",1375574400,,204,4.0
5679221,2,B00BWDA84W,it was  ok  but  ive  seen  far better  b  rated  B side  movies it  just  needed  more  story it  was very  slow and  had  little  depth,1374364800,2,137,3.6153846153846154
5679222,5,B00BWDA84W,"is one sexy piece of man meat!  I want seconds!

Although I'm still not sure how he made it through the entire movie as the biggest dude and still didn't kill any vampires.",1374192000,,172,4.181818181818182
5679223,1,B00BWDA84W,"This whole movie is less than a B rated. It is silly, stupid and very boring. I am constantly looking for an entertaining and professionally done vampire movie all the way thru but seems to be impossible to find.",1373760000,,212,4.461538461538462
5679224,3,B00BWDA84W,"This is not a unique plot line and there are not a lot of surprises here, unless of course you were expecting a Hitchcock mind bender with a hook.  Oh yes we do have one surprise, until now I never knew that placing a steel grate over a vampires grave would hold imprisoned forever, Bella Lugosi never mentioned that.  We have a vampire who escapes her entombment through the benevolent deeds of an innocent who is found dead of course, followed by a vengeful rampage in the streets and back yards of this small town USA.  The townspeople of course are all evolved on one side or the other of the sinister plot which imprisoned the lady in the first place.  The story line is so shallow and well worn that their is not a lot of character development needed so the director just started producing dead people who of course were not really dead yet, but who soon would be except for one... He of course with remain elusive awaiting his proper time in the inevitable sequel  The DVD had two points in its favor; 1) It was in English so no sub-titles and 2) they did not find it necessary of scatter fresh raw body parts all over my computer screen.  All and all it was not a really good flick, but neither was it offensive, I will however pass on the sequel.",1373414400,,1255,4.319148936170213
5679225,3,B00BWDA84W,"This was one of the better low budget vampire films that I have seen for some time. The story, characters, and acting were acceptable and held my interest. I would have liked to have had some more suspense in the last ten or fifteen minutes; there was hardly any. The wrap up was too simple and quick lacking any real confrontation; however, all in all the film was entertaining.",1372896000,4,379,4.507246376811594
5679226,4,B00BWDA84W,"A woman returns to her hometown after fifteen years, in order to visit her mother's grave. After meeting some of the locals, she goes about her business, only to find herself in the middle of a vampire uprising. It appears that the woman's mum is back from the dead, and chomping necks! Her name is Wynona, and she's out for bloody vengeance against those she deems to be her enemies. BLOOD REUNION is an ultra low-budget film w/ enough story and interesting characters to make up for any lack of funds. I started watching it, thinking I'd turn it off within a few minutes. However, I kept watching, and I'm glad I did. BR reminds me of those wonderful old, zero budget creepers from the 60s and 70s. The cast is tiny, most of the action takes place in real living-rooms, and the special effects are basic. Still, this had a charm that's lacking in many expensive movies. I quite enjoyed it...",1372723200,7,893,4.518518518518518
5679227,1,B00BWDA84W,"This movie is too simple. There are too many noises in the background. It should not be as a horror movie, but a sex movie.

The details are not enough to form a good movie.",1372636800,,173,3.942857142857143
5679228,4,B00BWDA84W,"It is unusual to see a low budget independent horror film like this. Its budgetary limitations are apparent, but the producers manage to make their limited resources go a long way. It is a vampire story which takes a more classic approach to the vampire genre, unlike some of the vampire films and television series that have been produced in recent years. Also, unlike a lot of independent horror (and big budget horror in fact) it does not rely entirely on blood and gore, but in fact has a story that is creative and makes you care about the characters.

The special effects are fairly well done, and the film does not rely on them, but uses them sparingly and effectively. The acting is decent, particularly from April Hartman (Janeth) and Paula Marcenaro Solinger (Winona), but the entire cast carry their performances well.

If you're looking for a splatter-fest slasher movie you won't find it here, but if you're looking for an entertaining vampire tale reminiscent of the classic films of the 60's, this one will likely be a good pick for you.",1371945600,,1052,4.743169398907104
5679229,5,B00BWDA84W,"liked this film a lot. It's not perfect, by any means, but it's a lot better than some of the low budget movies being cranked out these days. Though there is some gore (severed head), it doesn't go overboard with the blood and guts, and relies rather on story for its entertainment. The violence is limited to vampire neck biting, stakes driven through hearts, and one nasty bit with a shovel.

There is some nudity and sexual content that you would expect, especially if you're familiar with the director's (Jim DeVault) previous work, and the sex scene, though artistically handled, may be a bit too long for my taste, though the guys would probably like that ;)
At the same time, the movie has a sense of humor, tossing in a modest amount of comic relief to even out the mix.

Final verdict: it's a decent little popcorn movie for one made on such a low budget. Entertaining and fun to watch. If indie horror and/or vampires are your cup of tea, it's definitely worth checking out.",1371945600,,984,4.553672316384181

8574702,2,B00BWDA84W,"I was warned: one of the 'top reviews' gave the film 1 star, and the wrong trailer was played. I gave this 2 stars because one of the actors made some attempt at acting. Otherwise... it sucked.",1498262400,,193,4.243243243243243
8574703,3,B00BWDA84W,"I agree with some of the other reviewers.  The acting was good, the babes were hot and the special effects at the end were cheesy.  There's plenty to like here for fans of the B vampire flick.",1490486400,,192,4.162162162162162

8574705,3,B00BWDA84W,"For a low budget film with some dreadful acting (the police officer REALLY got on my nerves) this movie was surprisingly watchable.  The script mostly made sense, they didn't go out of their way to soak everything with blood, and you kind of liked a couple of the main characters.  Not enough to actually make this a good movie, but enough to make it watchable while you are getting steps on your Fitbit!",1466294400,2,404,4.52054794520548
