Hooray for Colorado Independent film. I'm a Colorado resident and I fully support the idea of strong, quality, independent productions coming out of our beautiful state, but this film is unfortunately not a representation of that idea. I was so thrilled that I stumbled across an independent horror feature that I had never seen.  Further, I was even happier that I found so many good reviews for the film. Even the one negative review here addressed some intriguing commentary that spurred me on to watch.

I have an exceptional passion for really well done, quality, independent horror features, particularly anything of a supernatural nature. With the changes in movie making and distribution models over the past decade, the digital market is now flooded with movie options from all types of independent producers on micro budgets, AND the horror genre is obviously the genre of choice for these independent producers and their micro budget productions.

As horror enthusiasts, this is both a blessing and a curse to our entertainment choices. For starters, the process of selecting a potentially quality flick can become seriously time consuming. I constantly feel like I spend more and more time trying to avoid renting or purchasing a movie that ends up looking and feeling like something that your neighbor shot on his iPhone, using more of your neighbors as actors and an ""outline"" of a script that encouraged improvisation. I can't possibly be the only one who feels that the horror genre has taken a beating from the huge number of these types of films. Since it's no longer possible to simply rely on box cover art and a trailer to help make a decision about renting/purchasing and viewing a horror feature, these choices now involve a web-search, a cursory check of the movie's profiles on IMBD, Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes and, of course the ever present, ever helpful Amazon reviews.

Usually after I've completed all of my requisite due diligence I usually feel fairly confident that I'm spending my time and money on something decent. I went a little further out on a limb for The Inner Room and accepted the fact that the movie could fall way below my most minimal expectations, yet...I faithfully committed out of the curiosity and support for the work coming out of the great state of Colorado!

From a technical standpoint, this is a very competent production. Nice location, excellent photography and some decent writing (in places). Jessica Duffy is clearly not an experienced actress, there are many scenes in the film where she is awkwardly wooden, particularly opposite her wooden costar, Marty Lindsey. There was absolutely no chemistry between the two of them - like they were total strangers instead of husband and wife. Jessica Duffy's performance was not completely hopeless however, she did show some promise at certain points. Fortunately Duffy is also genetically blessed! She's easy on the eyes and has a very sexy head of hair BUT... that hair dominated nearly all of her scenes. I've never seen that happen before, except...maybe with Julia Roberts in Mystic Pizza. Duffy's hair should have received it's own billing.
Like almost every other component of the movie, Marty Lindsey was also flat and wooden, he left little to no impression. In fact both Lindsey and Duffy's performances were upstaged by the minor supporting roles played by David Dalton as the evil landlord and Kristin Keating as the pesky neighbor Maggie.

As far as the story was concerned, the most flattering thing I can say is that it showed potential early in the film but as time wore on, the movie became nothing more than a succession of flat scenes with no connectivity, underlying story or continuity. So far I've only seen one other review here that challenges the positive reviews for this film, it's well written and goes into deeper detail about the flaws in the (lack of) story. If you are still on the fence and have not read it...check it out!

On a positive note, I have seen worse than The Inner Room and I was impressed that it did successfully demonstrate that we have a resource of technically savvy production talent in Colorado. There is hope for our independent, feature film industry!

...and the other positive: now you don't have to waste your money here to find that out!",1492128000,,4326,4.931318681318682
8467057,4,B005DKS216,"The story was a little hard to follow at first, it did pull it  together in the end. The camera work was impeccable and that made the movie more enjoyable. I was very excited to watch it as not only do I live close to the film site, I know two of the people in the movie very well. Oh, and Jessica Duffy makes a pair of jeans look so much better.",1440633600,,346,3.8055555555555554
8467058,1,B005DKS216,"Man what a mess! Some nice photography. Professional sound and special effects. Decent acting. Not great, but decent.

The problem lies in the story, to the extent that a story can be found. It's more of a random series of events in a dramatic situation. It's a dramatic situation that I've seen in many horror films. For instance, in the somewhat better&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Good-and-Evil/dp/B00JE5O8PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Good and Evil</a>.

In THE INNER ROOM, a youngish city couple move to the country, apparently for the husband's job. (He's a photographer.) It's intimated that the wife had a previous mental breakdown. Now she ... sees things. Is it in her head, or is it the supernatural? Unspoken domestic problems underlie these strange goings on.

In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Good-and-Evil/dp/B00JE5O8PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Good and Evil</a>, a youngish city couple move to the country, apparently for the husband's job. (He's a firefighter.) It's intimated that the wife had a previous mental breakdown. Now she ... sees things. Is it in her head, or is it the supernatural? Unspoken domestic problems underlie these strange goings on.

True, THE INNER ROOM precedes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Good-and-Evil/dp/B00JE5O8PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Good and Evil</a>, but there are plenty of other films about wives who see things, or maybe not, with underlying domestic problems. (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Mirror/dp/B003FMG84M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Mirror</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shutter/dp/B009EEHGTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shutter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fertile-Ground/dp/B004QLX0PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fertile Ground</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Lies-Beneath/dp/B00AEBBA2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Lies Beneath</a>&nbsp;and others whose titles I forget.) Most are not very good, because they have a ""Lifetime TV-movie"" quality about them. Too much emphasis on the soap opera, the horror merely a ""metaphor"" for the supernatural.

But there are other problems with THE INNER ROOM, mostly in the ""story."" We begin with this couple arriving at their new home, the wife seeing strange things, and we don't know why. We never get to know these characters except on the surface, so they feel as cardboard as those in slasher films (except that most slasher films are more fun).

Here's this cardboard woman, now seeing a red-haired boy in the woods, or a man emerging from her bathtub, or something slithering in the grass. Or not. All of it's haphazard, none of it fits together.

The filmmaker attempts the usual horror shocks. Some 14 minutes into the film, the wife is searching her car at night. Then a SHAPE moves past the frame -- SUDDENLY! -- to LOUD MUSIC!

I guess we're supposed to be shocked. But since this film lacks the context of a discernible story -- is it a ghost? a slasher? what? -- I don't know what to make of it. In any event, this dark shape never returns. It's as if the filmmaker is trying to decorate his tired domestic drama with some very old and tired horror film tricks.

Stuff comes out as the film proceeds. We learn about past infidelity, a dead baby, a possible grave in the woods, the local landlord who is not who he seems, harboring his own dark domestic secrets. So much stuff that doesn't quite fit together. The various domestic conflicts, supernatural manifestations, ""surprise"" twists and turns, and eventual deaths. They just lay there, randomly scattered across the screen.

The characters failed to engage or interest me. I found them boring and annoying. I was bored by this entire film.

Of the various films I mentioned,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Mirror/dp/B003FMG84M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Mirror</a>&nbsp;is the best. I enjoyed that one.

I don't trust the glowing reviews for this film. Lots of fake reviews on Amazon these days. You can buy them from marketing firms. And filmmakers often recruit friends, family, and co-workers to shower 5-star reviews on their films.

I expect my review will get a ton of ""unhelpful"" votes. It's still a bad movie.",1427932800,,4579,6.413961038961039
8467059,5,B005DKS216,"Excellent Psycho-thriller!  This little flick was a good balance between horror, suspense, and drama.  The plot was well done and it did not rely on a lot of blood, violence, and gore.  Some of the low budget movies have to develop their characters well because they do not have the money for a lot of spectacular tricks.  I think this was the case with this movie.  The music blended in and did not overtake the drama.  I especially liked ""Maggie"" because the actress, Kristin Keating, did a professional job and was well suited for the part.  The rest of the cast was excellent also.  Well worth watching.",1340668800,2,607,4.607476635514018
8467060,5,B005DKS216,"I think this film is all about expectations.  If you are expecting a big budget thriller or a horror film with a ton of blood and guts, you will most likely be disappointed.  If you are expected a low/no budget (this thing must have been made for under $100k) thriller that takes it's time developing, then you will most likely enjoy the film.  I'm not trying to say this is the greatest movie ever (because it's not), I'm just saying for my personal taste, I really enjoyed it.  Thought it was creepy.  The performances were really good for ""no-name"" actors.  The two leads actually had roles in the cult sci-fi film ""Ink.""  I wanted to see more of the Howard character, the actor did a great job in that role.  It DID drag a bit in parts and some of the production values weren't the best (particularly the lighting in certain scenes) - but overall, a very nice INDIE psycho-thriller.  Based on it's pacing, some might even argue it's more of a psycho-drama.  It's definitely a slow burn, but builds nicely to the end.  If your expectations are right going in, I do think you will enjoy this film.",1322784000,2,1099,4.472361809045226
8467061,4,B005DKS216,"The Inner Room is a surprisingly good independent horror film. Shot in Colorado it revolves around the married couple of Julianne/Jules played by Jessica Duffy & Chris played by Marty Lindsey. The film is a ""box film"" meaning that it only takes place at the cabin and the woods surrounding it.
  Director Jack Gastelbondo creates a scary isolated film. The film does have faults including pauses in dialogue & some lighting problems. These are easily forgettable with a compelling, quick moving story with numerous twists.
  The Inner Room does deliver. It includes the mainstays of the horror genre of blood, sex & nudity. The blood is plentiful but not overdone. The ghosts are truly scary and unexpected.
  Colorado independent film continues to get stronger & stronger. This film has some indie flaws but still delivers. It also showcases the great work of Duffy & Lindsey, veterans of Colorado cinema.",1312502400,5,906,5.046979865771812
