8187350,2,B00005KAQA,"This film does NOT have Jet Li in it.  It also doesn't have Jackie Chan in it either.  It DOES have some decent humor and a few decent kung-fu fights, but mostly is pretty weak.  Andy Lau is in this one and is also under-used.  If you liked Legend of Drunken Master and seek more like it - then look for Iron Monkey, Last Hero in China, Swordsman 2, Fong Sai Yuk 1 & 2, and if you want good Jackie Chan - look for Supercop, Who Am I?, and Operation Condor.  This film isn't horrible, but you should probably pass on it anyway.",992217600,4,526,4.019230769230769
