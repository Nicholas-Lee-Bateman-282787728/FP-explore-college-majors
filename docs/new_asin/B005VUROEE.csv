4897895,5,B005VUROEE,"Eddie and Julie put together a fantastic resource for prospective knappers and intermediate knappers.  Advance knappers will pick up a trick or two as well.  The fun to practice exercises and logical progression really helped me to understand the process like nothing else has.  I can't say enough about how valuable a resource the exercises provide.  9 Step Knapping is concise, clear, and filled with excellent demos.  If you've thought about getting started in knapping, attempted it before but felt intimidated and are still struggling this DVD will put you on track towards learning this beautiful,ancient art.",1329264000,7,615,5.298969072164948
4897896,5,B005VUROEE,"If you have never flintknapped before, or like me, have been exposed to flintknapping but have limited knowledge or experience, then this DVD will have you off and running in no time.  The popsicle stick exercises that are taught to develop strike force and accuracy are fantastic.  A few minutes of drills every day and you'll quickly be ready to turn glass or rock into useful tools.  The DVD then goes on to walk you through, step-by-step, the process of turning a hunk of stone into a spear point.  A great instructional video!",1328486400,3,531,4.67741935483871
4897897,5,B005VUROEE,"Eddie and Julie got it right!  This should be everyone's blueprint for teaching new knappers.  The DVD is simple, straightforward, and entertaining.  They present basic techniques in a down to earth, very accessible way.  It's easy to follow -- partly because it's easy to watch.  They aren't professional actors with directors and scriptwriters, but they obviously have a great understanding of how to teach complicated concepts in an uncomplicated way.

Bottom line:  if you want to learn to knap, this is a GREAT place to start!",1327017600,6,531,5.104651162790698
4897898,5,B005VUROEE,I've always had an interest in learning primitive survival skills and managed to learn a quite a bit.  Even though I had bought DVDs from other authors knapping remained mystery to me.  Questions where: where do I need to hit this rock to knock off a spall? How hard and at what angle do I need to strike to release the desired flake? A year ago I took Eddie's 9 Step Knapping workshop over a weekend. In those two days Eddie's simplified approach to teaching the art of knapping put in place the concepts I lacked and allowed me to answer those questions for myself. By the end of the workshop I found myself making respectable bifaces and points.  In this DVD Eddie has done an excellent job of recreating his 9 Step knapping approach to teaching this art.,1320278400,3,758,4.438848920863309
4897899,5,B005VUROEE,"I have been knapping for several years off and on with limited successes. This video put into perspective the mistakes I was making, and provided a system to utilize that took me to another level instantly. The first biface I made after watching this video was the largest successful spearpoint I have ever made. This is truly an innovative approach to an ancient subject, and I highly recommend this video to beginners and struggling intermediates like myself. If you just started or want to start knapping, get this video right away and save yourself from making a ton of destructive mistakes on your path to proficiency. A truly excellent teaching video!",1319500800,3,657,4.927927927927928
4897900,5,B005VUROEE,"Having taken the 9 Step Knapping live course from Practical Primitive, I was eagerly looking forward to the release of their video. Eddie and Julie didn't disappoint!

Eddie has developed this teaching system from his years of flintknapping experience, and has taken the approach of simplifying anything that can be simplified. The result is an easy-to-grasp approach to knapping that gives immediate success to the beginning student.

For the more experienced knapper, the 9 Step Knapping rules and principles provide a simplified, easy-to-remember mental model that instantly provides feedback when you run into difficulties, letting you know exactly how a strike went wrong and how to correct that for the next strike.

If you're brand-new to flintknapping, you couldn't ask for a better introduction to this ancient and challenging skill. If you're an experienced knapper who is getting inconsistent results, this video will give you a set of practice drills and a systematic approach to the stone that will dramatically improve your finished pieces.",1319414400,5,1054,5.414634146341464
8487697,5,B005VUROEE,This is a well made video and makes flintknapping accessible to everyone. Highly recommended for all beginners and intermediate knappers. I had struggled when I moved from practicing on glass bottle bottoms to actual stone and wasn't having success. This video made a big difference for me!!,1504656000,,291,5.212765957446808
8487698,5,B005VUROEE,"so here's the rundown, I'm of above average intelligence. I tried to just figure out this flint knapping stuff on my own by watching others on the net. I tried to make simple points and just wasn't getting it. I figured rather then watch folks do it lets try going the instruction way. After a search of the net I wasn't happy with some of the reviews of some teachings. This instructional DVD was among the highest so I took a chance. Man am I glad I did this is best instructions on flint knapping anywhere IMO I broke out the tools after watching this one time and produced my first real hunting point from Bottle bottoms. there are great training technics for percussing cleanly and accurately and great info on angles and that was my down fall all along angles, angles, angles. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to learn this great ancient art. There are a lot of ways to Knapp but this is the best IMO to learn then adapt your won style from later.",1443398400,,966,4.372222222222222
8487699,5,B005VUROEE,This is just the information I needed. I highly recommend 9 Steps.,1410307200,,66,4.583333333333333

8487701,4,B005VUROEE,Good DVD. Could go into detail a little more.,1405987200,,45,4.111111111111111
8487702,5,B005VUROEE,"I've wanted to do this for a while now, but haven't found the right learning platform until I found this video. Books are great but you really need to see how this is done up close and personal. These folks are as easy going as it gets, and have a teaching style that I wish many of my early school teachers had. This is a reasonably priced and fully comprehensive approach to learning flint knapping. Thank you to both Eddie and Julie for putting together such a fine piece of work. Now I'm off to buy some tools, and some stone to knap.",1372636800,2,538,4.233009708737864
8487703,5,B005VUROEE,"I had read some books, watched Craig Ratzat's video and even had some live instruction from experienced knappers. I was able to follow ridges and get good flakes, but the hardest part for me to grasp was what flake to take next. Eddie's 9 Steps gave me a clear procedure to follow that advanced my knapping a great deal. Though I've not done much pressure flaking yet, with percussion flaking, I'm now able to make something that actually looks like a point that is flat and ready for final pressure flaking. Eddie's 9 Steps is a logical, workable system and I highly recommend it to anyone new to flintknapping.",1371600000,2,612,4.623853211009174
8487704,5,B005VUROEE,"Flint knapping is not easy to do.... But it is doable... This DVD supplies the right information to anyone wanting to learn. You need the time, tools and desire to want to flint knap. Also would be good to take a class to get hands on experience.",1368057600,2,246,4.25531914893617
8487705,5,B005VUROEE,"Best instruction I've found for learning to make arrowheads. Breaks it down to nine easy steps starting with using popscicle sticks for a low cost way to learn how to make the proper striking techniques. Also teaches how make arrowheads from bottle glass! It's a joy to watch, and learn  from. Have fun!!!",1365033600,4,305,4.754716981132075
8487706,5,B005VUROEE,"there are a lot of books that are hard to fallow because they get to technical. This dvd was made pratical. they cover what you actually need to start knapping and they don't waist your time with a lot of complicated equations that aren't nessecary.
 Also seeing them work stone was helpfull instead of reading and truing to visualize it. If you are a beginner knapper this is a must have dvd.",1359504000,,393,4.458333333333333
