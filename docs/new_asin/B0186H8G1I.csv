7540945,5,B0186H8G1I,I saw this on demand for free and afterwards immediately purchased the DVD. I have been forcing anyone I care about to watch it. It presents a very big problem in a entertaining and simple to understand format. Parents of young children should especially watch the sugar movie. Being aware of what the industry is doing to our children's food is paramount for their future well being. It will force you to make more conscious and carful decisions about what foods you purchase.,1465603200,3,477,4.759036144578313
7540946,5,B0186H8G1I,"Get this. It changed my life.
I have watched it dozens of times. Don't be put of by the casual demeanor of these movies - they are highly accessible and not at all snobby. Gosh, I hate food snobs.
These are serious in their intent, with just a touch of humor thrown in.
I am a Vegan and learned much, here.
Highly recommended for your permanent library. An excellent investment.",1498003200,,378,4.414285714285715
