2121185,1,B0002V7O60,"I was disappointed with this film, especially since I am a big Geraldine Page fan.  Despite its billing as a dark comedy or ""jolly horror"", I found this movie to be neither funny nor frightening, just rather campy and boring and not at all worthy of Ms. Page's or Ruth Gordon's talents.  The writing and subplots were more suited to a 1960s soap opera than a feature film.  This is no ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" type movie, although I believe it was made by the same director. A low budget, poorly written and overacted production.  What was Geraldine Page thinking?  She was so much better than that.",1246665600,3,607,4.583333333333333

2121187,5,B0002V7O60,"This is a really strange movie. I had never heard of it before a friend loaned it to me, but I'm glad I watched it. This movie is the very definition of ""dark comedy."" People are murdered, there is suspense, and you never really laugh--yet you can't take the movie seriously! It is really quite amusing all around.

The basic plot is that a woman whose husband dies leaving her penniless, decides  she can't give up her extravagant lifestyle. So she puts on a convincing farce, and she devises an outrageous scheme for continuing in her lifestyle. The result is a very clever movie that keeps you guessing and at the same time sticks a  grin on the corners of your mouth.

The acting by Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon is very good, and I especially like Gordon. If you have ever enjoyed the acting of either of these ladies, I would venture to say you will enjoy this one as well.

Oh, and the ""punch line"" at the end is good too!",1208217600,,930,4.3526011560693645
2121188,3,B0002V7O60,"Storywise this stylish movie made in the Arizona desert does not offer anything special, it's been done before and after: Older women who are deliciously bad and do not hesitate to plan and commit murder. The performances of the main actresses are a great delight to watch (especially the opening scene). Geraldine Page is hamming it up nicely, Ruth Gordon for once does not play a brash, vulgar loudmouth but is emulating the great character acress Thelma Ritter as Page's servant. At moments this movie made me think of John Sayle's Passion Fish. Was it an inspiration for that truly great piece of art?",1179619200,2,605,4.826923076923077

2121190,4,B0002V7O60,"If you like old feature mystique with great actors, try and buy this DVD. Ruth Gordon and Geraldine Page are icons in the movie business and show their great acting ability in this mystery. Now this is the movie they should remake with some current stars. A little updating would put this film in a class by itself.",1167868800,2,315,4.448275862068965
2121191,3,B0002V7O60,"An elderly widow finds herself left nothing in her husband's will, so she takes to employing housekeepers and murdering them for their life savings. She meets her match when one comes along who is not as meek as she looks, but is actually investigating the disappearance of the last housekeeper, who was her friend. The scene is set for a little old lady showdown!

I agree with most other reviewers in that ""Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice"" is a black comedy rather than a thriller, and it succeeds thanks to the bravura performances of Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon, particularly Page as the villain Claire Marrabel, who really carries the whole film. Her very first scene shows us just the sort of woman she is, when her barely concealed excitement at the reading of her late husband's will turns to rage and bitterness when it turns out he had sunk all their assets into huge debts without ever telling her. Page plays the role magnificently, really throwing herself into the part, and continues in a vein of scarcely controlled wildness throughout the rest of the film. Two scenes stood out for me; firstly when she commits her very first murder, she is required to bury the body in a hole and plant a sapling pine tree over the top of this (this ever growing row of new trees becomes a visual gag for the rest of the movie). Page launches herself into the task with vigour, seemingly doing the full job while the camera and credits roll over the top of the scene. The second great moment is much later on in the movie when Claire has drugged two potential victims and tries to set their house on fire. It is Page we see (not a stand-in) crazily flinging a lighted cushion around the house trying to get the rest of the furniture to catch on fire. It looks quite dangerous, and my admiration went out to the actress for doing this scene herself. But even in the more sedate scenes, Page fills the character of Claire Marrabel with seething greed and madness, and she's always a joy to watch.

In contrast to this, Ruth Gordon takes on a far more subtle turn as Alice Dimmock, the housekeeper that fights back. Playing much of the film as a meek doormat to her employer, she really shines in scenes when she confers with an accomplice she has helping her on the outside, and the spunky character of Miss Dimmock finally comes out, and her feisty words made me feel that here was a worthy opponent for the evil Mrs Marrabel. And it's here that the meat of the film lies. Gradually, both women start to snoop into each others business and, entertainingly, both become suspicious of the other at about the same time. This leads to the best section of the movie: when both women are just starting to square up to each other over their suspicions, and every kline of dialogue contains a barbed hint or a subtle accusation. Sadly this tension cannot last, as all too soon the gloves come off and it becomes a battle for survival. After a great chase and even a physical battle inside Marrabel's house has ensued, the audience is totally rooting for poor Alice to make her getaway and expose the true murderous nature of her employer.

I won't reveal what happens, but I did find the final climax of the film slightly disappointing, so see what you think. But the film does work, despite very unnecessary support and subplots involving all manner of forgettable side characters. Not one of the rest of the cast comes close to holding your attention in the way that Page and Gordon can, in fact the film could easily have been made as a two-hander, although I suppose this would have made it less marketable. Mind you the terrible publicity images on the DVD releases don't do a very good job either - there are no visible dead bodies in the film - why can't the sleeve designers repect the fans and package the film with it's stars on the front? Just because they are too far over 25 years of age, I suppose. All in all, great fun, thanks to the efforts of it's two stars.",1157500800,18,3970,4.511111111111111
2121192,5,B0002V7O60,"""Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice?"" is, I believe, often overlooked for flashier, more renowned entries in the same vein of Grand Guignol - movies like ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?"", ""Lady In A Cage"", ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"", and so forth.

But in ""Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice?"" we have something that none of those other movies had: a lack of Legend and a sense of Cult Following, and next-to-no expectations when viewing the movie for the first time. And so what we see when we sit down to watch it is something fresh, exciting and very, very good indeed.

""Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice?"" stars the very wonderful Geraldine Page as the recently widowed Claire Marrable, who, in the wake of being left destitute by the financial wasteland that is her late husband's estate, moves to an isolated part of rural Arizona, and takes on a succession of tight-lipped, downtrodden housekeepers. The reason for the succession soon becomes apparent: Mrs. Marrable is murdering these women in short order, after they've signed their life savings over to her, and using them as fertiliser for what must be said is a remarkably verdant desert garden.

Enter the seemingly innocuous Alice Dimmock (the equally wonderful Ruth Gordon), who, after the briefest of introductory periods, sets about working to her own agenda: discovering the whereabouts of Mrs. Marrable's last housekeeper.

Performances are incredibly, incredibly good: Geraldine Page is a delight to watch in almost all of her movie roles, and this proves no different: she's a magnetic, charismatic powerhouse who breathes a pathos and a kind of twisted empathy into the murderous role of Mrs. Marrable. Ruth Gordon, riding on a high from her 1968 Academy Award for the role of Minne Castavet in ""Rosemary's Baby"", gives a similarly inspired performance as the titular Alice: this could have easily been a one-dimensional reading of the character, but Gordon's low-key, understated screen presence and hugely entertaining mannerisms propel the character of Alice Dimmock right off the screen and into our minds: she's real, and Gordon is excellent.

The supporting cast is of a very high standard, too: Rosemary Forsyth is believable in her very small supporting role as Mrs. Marrable's young neighbour Harriet Vaughn, and Robert Fuller gives a good turn in his supporting role as Alice's nephew  Mike Darragh. But this show belongs lock, stock and barrel to Gordon and Page: the supporting cast simply provides a solid backdrop to their excellent performances.

Direction is great - the late swingin' sixties colour clashes of the fabrics and furnishings make the interior scenes a beautiful contrast to the exterior sparseness of the Arizona landscape. Lighting, too, is used to great effect: rather than feel hopelessly dated, as many of the early seventies thrillers do now, the well-lit, almost soap-operaish quality of the photography actually serves to compliment the unstructured, loose flow of director Lee H. Katzin's confident, narrative camerawork. I can't name many other movies of this period that work visually as well as ""Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice?"", and that's high praise, indeed.

All in all, ""Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice?"" has certainly stood the test of time as a record of the talents of Page and Gordon - but more importantly, remains as relevant and enjoyable today, and on the same levels, as it did on its initial release. This isn't a movie you love for the camp value, because there's not many camp laughs to be had - it's simply an excellent film, and one well-worth owning.

DVD-wise the print is excellent, and while the sound sadly is mono, it's not that big of a deal with some decent television speakers.

Wholeheartedly recommended.",1150675200,13,3745,5.104575163398692
2121193,4,B0002V7O60,"This is a fun little black comedy from television director Lee Katzin.  Playing off the title of ""Whatver Happened to Baby Jane"",  it is not ruined by its television look and feel because of a particularly memorable performance by Geraldine Page.

Page plays an older women who has essentially been driven mad with rage after her husband dies and leaves her only his debts and .the contents of his briefcase.  She moves to the desert and lives very comfortably by dispatching a series of live-in housekeepers who have turned over their life savings to her.  Katzin tells the story mostly from the POV of Page's character so that after a while the audience is actually identifying with her.

Ruth Gordon is essentially wasted in a very straight role.  Rosemary Forsyth and Robert Fuller make an appealing couple but are very minor to story.

Page is absolutely brilliant and plays the ironic twist at the end of the film beautifully.  At the same time that she is found out, she finds out that her husband actually made a provision for her to live comfortably after his death.  She plays this final scene in such a way that we understand that discovering he actually loved her is far more important to her than getting away with murder.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1119744000,3,1283,4.653333333333333

Its a simple plot, so the film is much like the book, and i like them both. I don't find the movie scary until the end but its still a fun ride.",1398038400,,419,4.0602409638554215

Although Talullah, as Mrs. Trefoil is not really a murderer, just a religious fanatic, hateful mother-in-law from hell that loved her dead son as if he were her lover, and hated any woman that tried to get close to him.  In Alice, played to the hilt by Geraldine Page, she is stoney broke, thanks to her dead husband, but she wants to continue to live high on the hog as if she is an aristocrat, but kills her housekeepers and steals their money to continue in her lifestyle.  As a musician, harpsichord music can add to the suspense and horror of a movie, and this music does not disappoint.",1353283200,,729,4.6434108527131785
2121230,4,B0002V7O60,"I've never liked the title for this movie as it so obviously trades on the fame garnered by Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?  Also, it's not a little redundant because everyone knows exactly what happened to Aunt Alice (played by Ruth Gordon).  That aside, this is less a suspense thriller and more a character study by Geraldine Page (who is a marvel to watch no matter what role she took on).  She was a force to be reckoned with and did more with a single gesture than most actresses can with an entire body of work.  I've also never considered this a black comedy (very little about it is humorous, she tries to kill a poor dog!  And well, yeah, there was that little boy too).  The weakest parts of this movie are the tacked on love story between the neighbor (Rosemary Forsyth) and Aunt Alice's nephew (Robert Fuller) and that bizarre ending (how kind of them to let her sleep in).  Other than that, this is all about Geraldine Page playing one of the scariest women in movie history.  That cackle alone provided chills galore.  I love the scene where she could and did everything despicable but she couldn't burn a Bible (her undoing).
What's a poor widow supposed to do?",1308528000,3,1177,4.514150943396227
2121252,3,B0002V7O60,"But the finish is weak and disappointing, not to mention just silly. There were also some extremely stupid parts (SPOILERS), like when Alice hits her employer, knocks her down, then turns her back on her to go use the phone (which is out of order anyway). Uh uh!!! Nobody does that when the person is trying to KILL you! Or when Mrs. Marrable pretends that she needs a letter written to Albert or Alvin, then says, ""Oh, just put Al,"" so Alice begins the letter just as she signs her name, ""Al"" all loopy and distinctive - now who is going to do that? She'd more likely just print the name.  So just be ready for some ridiculously frustrating scenes.",1301270400,,649,4.408333333333333

Page plays what can only be described as an insane serial killer, who likes to plant trees and bushes over her victims' graves.  Then along comes another potential victim, Ruth Gordon, and things get even stranger.  The film is definitely fun, but there was a lack of believable quirkiness in it for me, like the way that Page would laugh when she pulled off some new diabolical machination.  But really, it comes down to personal taste and whether or not it works for you.  It didn't quite for me.

Nonetheless, it has some nice twists.  Recommended.",1297468800,,681,4.578512396694215

So to suppliment her income, she hires a successions of housekeepers with nest eggs and offs them, becoming a deranged 'Mary Mary Quite Contrary' with her pine trees. When Ruth Gordon shows up, things take a turn for the interesting. The chemistry between these two veterans is impeccable. Gordon, fresh from her Academy Award winning role as Minnie Castevet in 'Rosemary's Baby' is spunky, lively, and hilarious. Page, who would win her own Award 16 years later for 'The Trip To Bountiful', plays it up to the hilt, bordering on campiness, but never straying. Robert Fuller, Rosemary Forsythe round out an excellent cast, with excellent direction from Lee Katzin, and sure footed production by Robert Aldrich, who's previous forays into Grand Guignol, 'What Ever Happened To Baby Jane', and 'Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte' are not lost on this entertaining ride.

2121259,5,B0002V7O60,"""Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice?"" was made in the same vein as ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?"" and ""Hush, Hush...Sweet Charlotte"". It is considered the third installment in the ""Baby Jane"" franchise by most ardent fans of the original. First released in 1969, ""Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice?"" was produced by ""Baby Jane"" director Robert Aldrich. While watching the film you get an eery sense of ""Baby Jane"" in the feel of the script and the production. ""...Aunt Alice?"" deals with a woman named Mrs. Marrable, played with canny villany, by stage actress Gearldine Page, who discovers her husband has left her flat broke leaving his widow with only his stamp collection. To stay financially afloat this woman hires maids, whom she steals money from and eventually kills. Like ""Baby Jane"" and ""Hush, Hush"" this film deals with women, in desperate situations, killing for cash. Extremely well done, ""Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice?"" has some of the best acting in a film. Page tears up the screen as the woman who is desperate. Her facial expressions, that wig she wears, and her campy performance, will satisfy the most faithful ""Baby Jane"" fan. Ruth Gordon has a role in the film  playing another servant of Marrable's called Alice. Unbeknownst to Mrs. Marrable Alice is trying to find out what she is up to. '70's hunk Robert Fuller from TV's ""Emergency"" and former soap actress Rosemary Forsythe have supporting roles.

Here though the true shining star is Geraldine Page who masterfully plays the wicked serial murderess in such a way that were she a relative of Glenn Close's as Alex Forest in Fatal Attraction ALEX WOULD BE THE NICER ONE!  I won't give a spoiler by telling you how it ends especially because I was a bit confused by it myself.  I do though highly recommend this evil story of a most unsuspecting female serial killer.
