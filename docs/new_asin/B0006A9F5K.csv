Really good work, interesting to view it again from a post 9-11 perspective.  In 2000, before the DVD was out, I wanted to buy the material, so I actually contacted the artist, and he quoted an insane price above $100,000 USD.  Good thing I waited for the DVD to come out!",1149724800,2,440,4.1647058823529415
