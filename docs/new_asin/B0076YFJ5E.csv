It is better than some B movie junk you see,because there is some some real effort. I had no problem with the acting . I like it when creators of a film try to make it different from the rest. My major problem is there is no way understand half the time what is on the screen.  It is visually interesting though.",1464998400,,423,4.158536585365853
8511320,4,B0076YFJ5E,"This wasn't what I was expecting but having said that I really dug it. Indie movies are cool as much for what they are not as what they are. This is not one big budget Hollywood explosion after another, it's like watching an updated creature feature, which I happen to love.",1368921600,,274,4.392156862745098

8511322,4,B0076YFJ5E,"I admit that the full plot doesn't come across, like a lot of the other reviews on Amazon state, but the performances, effects, soundtrack and beautiful cinematography make up for that. There are some stunning shots of the beach and woods and some interesting visual effects too.

A lot of the dialogue scenes came across very natural, almost like in a hidden-camera film or documentary, which was good for me because it added to the realism.
The acting was quite good and my favourite performance was during the bathtub scene when one character is frantically trying to scrub the mysterious black gunk off her friend.

I enjoyed the film on the whole, sure it had its slight flaws, but there were more good points than bad. If you manage to see this anywhere, you may as well pick it up just to see it for yourself. I've seen a lot worse.",1355270400,,839,4.549668874172186
8511323,3,B0076YFJ5E,"Okay, I'm not sure why these attractive women put on their most stylish outfits and highest heels to go stalking around the woods and rocky shoreline, but thank you.  Set somewhere remote in Britain, this is long on atmospherics and low on story, with a decent dose of nudity, thanks again.  There's some alien probing and a creepy guy in a suit more out of Dawn of the Dead than Men in Black, plus a black slime that seems to mark the victims of extraterrestrial interference.  All very entertaining to watch, if not understand.  A few borrowed pieces from 2001: A Space Odyssey help, and I enjoyed the surrealistic black and white footage.  The black man, (who's the man in black), heralds the coming doom which involves a black, tar-like slime covering the women's bodies.  What that means is anybody's guess, but it seems to work for the film.  Better acting than most exploitation films sets this one apart.  (Don't stop at the end credits--there's more.)",1340323200,2,960,4.740963855421687
8511324,3,B0076YFJ5E,"Anyone who expected to see a sequel to Men in Black wasn't very bright, in my opinion. But on its own, this is an entertaining, low-budget alien flick with a little sex appeal thrown in to keep it interesting. Typical pulp fiction on film. Quit analyzing and enjoy!",1338681600,,265,4.541666666666667
8511325,4,B0076YFJ5E,"I really enjoyed watching this film. From its amazing scenery to its almost dreamworld type editing, it really stands out as something different from your everyday movie. The story Had me gripped and some of the scenes were hilarious ( girl with head in toilet being sick to Irish music, classic )",1334620800,,297,4.730769230769231
8511326,3,B0076YFJ5E,"I think it's a decent movie.

It has nothing to do with the Will Smith Men in Black movie, on the contrary it very much seems
that it borrows from the legends of ""real"" MIBs just after the Cold War. I was turned onto it by
a friend that's into scifi/horror, went into it with an open mind, and was pleasantly surprised.

The story is a bit disjointed to follow towards the end (Editing? Hard to tell?), however it
has good acting, it has good looking women , and an interesting premise (don't forget popcorn).

If you dig Indie stuff that isn't from Hollyweird, I think it's worth a watch.",1334534400,,589,4.336363636363636
8511327,1,B0076YFJ5E,"Im not going to lie, this film is a travesty...Three woman (two are hinted at being in a relationship, but never explored) are being stalked by a man dressed in black...who seems to be an alien, pretty straightforward right? WRONG! It just made no sense. Two of the woman are UFO hunters, taking regular trips down to the woods (In very high heels, which is amusing to watch them struggle...nice costume choice) in order to sit on the beach and wait for aliens I presume, then when they return after one of their UFO hunts they realise they have lost time, 4 hours...which apparently is the amount of time aliens need to stand around your bed and experiment on you with a hoover hose and a cheese grater - dressed as if they are about to de fumigate a loft! Then when the women wake up they appear to have developed a black pen mark on their bodies. Then after 40 painful minutes of them getting changed over and over again seen through a weird fish eye lens style in their rooms (was this meant to be the aliens watching - I don't know!) They begin to transform into aliens I think...wasn't really sure what was going on to be honest, two of the girls got naked put some contacts in and was covered in what looks like road tar? The film has been plastered with 2nd unit time lapses and shots of the sea...they were actually the finest thing about this film...although way too many and more fades to black than an episode of Little House! The soundtrack consisted of some ok songs, none recognisable obviously due to lack of ANY funds...and the score consisted of nothing but Apple Loops from Soundtrack pro lmao! In all I hated this film...It has recently seen a name change as on the titles it was called ""THE WOMEN IN BLACK"" but all the sites for this film call it ""MEN IN BLACK - DARK WATCHERS"" This is probably due to the fact the producers realised (pretty late on) That this would be copyright infringement so in their infinite wisdom renamed it, unfortunately they seem to have forgotten Daniel Radcliffe's ""The Woman in Black"" released earlier this year. It just all seems so thrown together and desperate. Don't be fooled this is NOT a studio release, it looks like it was shot by a group of students, which is fine, but insult everyone by demanding 10 for this piece of turd! I can almost guarantee there was no script...but if there was then shame on the actors because it felt like watching my three sisters at a school play...it was cringeworthy! I don't usually slate a film this much but I was totally insulted by the whole thing! A waste of money and time!!",1334448000,4,2574,4.467091295116773
8511328,3,B0076YFJ5E,"This is not a sequel to those other movies,This effort is based on facts as we know them and governments make us privy to.

Philip Gardiner has brought us similar efforts,Perhaps not as successfully as this outing.

There are hot chicks,men in black and a alien or two.

This is filmed very unusually with almost a documentary feel and yet has elements reserved for some cable channels.

The MAN IN BLACK has some eerie moments with the women in scenes by themselves and sometimes as a same sex coupling.

The aliens come off as a negative image ( literally) and a pawn for MIB : Dark Watchers .

Much promise, great title with excellent timing of release and the girls are easy on the disc.",1329004800,,691,4.488
