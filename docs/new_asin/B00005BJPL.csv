7937657,5,B00005BJPL,"Otaru lives on a planet inhabited only by men. The people have created marionettes that look like women to fulfill their desires; whether they be for working, fighting or anything else. These marionettes are pretty much devoid of emotion and personality. They can be very cold. Otaru, however, has stumbled upon 3 marionettes with ""maiden"" circuits. This allows them to have personalities and emotions. Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry are Otaru's marionettes. They live together but are drawn into a war to save their country from a foreign invader. Saber Marionettes are the ultimate weapon in this war; and Otaru's girls are on the front lines.

This series is pretty over the top, but tons of fun. It's been around a while, so the animation and music is very outdated. After watching it a little you can get used to it. The action and comedy are so much fun that they overshadow the other flaws with the series. Saber Marionette J reminds me a lot of Vandread. The premise is pretty similar. This is a very fun series to watch. I think that just about every anime fan can find something to love about this series.",1355184000,,1113,4.707692307692308
7937658,5,B00005BJPL,"Saber Marionette J is one of my fav anime titles. In this final part of the story the truth behind the maiden circuits is at last revealed. We learn the truth behind the creation Of Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry as well as the Saber Dolls. We also see Otaru's desperate struggle as he tries preserve everything he knows and loves without giving up what is most dear to him. What drives SMJ is the emotional bond between Otaru and is Marionettes. It's this bond that is put to the test in this final collection as the Marionettes are torn between doing what's needed and obeying Otaru. The final scenes are some of the most emotional scenes in all of anime. I'm not the type of guy that gets all teary eyed, but I admit a tear fell from my eye during these final episodes. SMJ is a beautiful series that proves that it takes more then flesh and blood to make someone human. The story deals with heavy subject matter and really gets to root of what it means to ""be alive"". If you loved anime titles like Oh My Goddess, Hand Maid May, and Tenchi Muyo you'll love SMJ. A truly beautiful series.",999043200,2,1089,4.3431372549019605
7937659,5,B00005BJPL,"For those of you who have been following this series this far, you had best see the collosal ending.  the Mesopatamia is attacking Terra 2, and the true reason for Otaru's Saber dolls is revealed.  An awesome ending to a super series, plus Hanagota gets beat up a lot too, what more do you need?!",996364800,,296,4.363636363636363
7937660,4,B00005BJPL,"First off, I must admit that I really like the Saber Marionette concept, and all three DVD's in this series are top quality and well-produced.  That being said, I felt the conclusion to this series was a bit rushed and the dialogue failed to fully explain what was happening.  I believe the ""big message"" of this series is that love can be either obsessive and destructive, or healthy and liberating; if you watch the conclusion of the series with that in mind (and boy, I wish it was better expressed in the show!), I think it's a lot more satisfying.  I think the only thing that really bugged me about the conclusion was that Otaru--who learns that he is effectively the innocent pawn of an elaborate scheme concocted by Faust, his own shogun and the mysterious Lorelei--does not react with more shock and rage when his relationship with Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry is threatened.  But it's a minor point; if you liked the rest of the series, you'll probably like the conclusion.",994982400,,982,4.691860465116279
7937661,5,B00005BJPL,"Ok, Let me put it this way...  If you liked the Tenchi Muyo series or the Fushigi Yugi series you will LOVE this one!!!  It has some of the best elements an anime can have to make you fall in love with it.  Cute lovable characters (Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry), lots of humor and drama (which, for all the romantic types that get into this :), will keep you wanting more), and some awesome fighting action to boot.  I love how this one really hits on your emotions when it focuses on the relationships between the Marionettes and their masters and how each Marionette is special in their own way.  I could easily spoil it, :P but you'll just have to pick up on this awesome series!  It's not to be passed up and should belong in any true anime lover's collection!!!",991094400,3,766,4.359154929577465
