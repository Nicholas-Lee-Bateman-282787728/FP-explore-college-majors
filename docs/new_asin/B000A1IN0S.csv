2349930,3,B000A1IN0S,"I saw the DVD last night with my daughter and I thought it was boring.  It's a story book put into the form of a video. Someone narrates the story.  They only show the boy bear going to the potty once or twice.  Not much information to teach my child to go to the potty.  I had to sit with her and say ""you see the boy's going to the potty"".  Because we as adults know that bears don't go in the potty.  It's a very short video, and I don't think that the price goes with the product.  I got mine used.",1140652800,,502,3.8155339805825244
2349931,2,B000A1IN0S,"This tape failed to capture my son's attention.  If I sat with him he would watch for maybe a minute and then begin squirming and want to leave the room.  My son loves watching videos so for him to not be even a little interested, this must be the most boring and unappealing kid's video ever.",1138752000,2,293,4.214285714285714
2349932,3,B000A1IN0S,"I bought this video to encourage my nearly 3-year-old to use the big potty. Unfortunately, it's so simplistic that she loses interest halfway through and changes the DVD. Perhaps it would have worked six months ago.",1137283200,,215,5.0
2349933,5,B000A1IN0S,"My little boy had no interest in using the potty. Now he's asking about big kid underwear and telling me that tomorrow he'll use the potty. Well, I know tomorrow might be next week or next month but this charming video has definitely started him down the potty training path. What more can I ask for? I think this is a great video for introducing potty training to a young child.",1134950400,,379,4.352112676056338
2349934,5,B000A1IN0S,THIS IS CUTE MY CHILD LOVED IT.BUT DID NOT ENCOURAGE HER TO USE THE POTTY.BUT I GUESS WHEN THE CHILD IS READY THEY WILL GO.,1134950400,4,123,3.96
2349935,2,B000A1IN0S,"This video was a little too delicate on this matter. If you prefer to use such phrases as ""wee wee"" and ""wonderous, underous pants"" this video will compliment your household. It did not include important messages about washing your hands after using the bathroom nor what to actually do on the toilet. I purchased the video to encourage my three year old son to get over the last obstacle of potty traning. The only result was that he has reverted to calling it ""wee wee"" instead of what it really is. The animation was dodgy but appropriate for small children. I would only recommend this video for children that have not begun the process yet otherwise it is very vague and a tad overly annoying.",1134604800,4,698,4.592
2349936,4,B000A1IN0S,"Its a very nice, non-pushy video about a little bear who learns to use the potty.  I was a little disappointed at the animation, as the characters don't move realistically, but my daughter doesnt seem to notice.  She never cared about big girl underwear before, and this dvd encouraged her to think of it as something wonderful.",1130716800,4,328,4.7368421052631575
2349937,5,B000A1IN0S,"The story is delightful, the animation lively, but more importantly the lesson doesn't get lost in the storyline. No More Diapers is a great tool for helping parents teach their children to use the toilet.",1127692800,,205,4.885714285714286
2349938,5,B000A1IN0S,"I purchased No More Diapers because it's new and I thought my 2 1/2 year-old would respond positively to the animation and the free potty reward stickers. Well, I was right! Dylan loves the program and is fascinated with the stickers. No More Diapers is a delighful soft-sell introduction to potty training. It has sweet characters and fun sing-along songs.  Last night Dylan had a potty success and I'm sure No More Diapers deserves some credit.",1126137600,12,446,4.868421052631579
2349957,4,B000A1IN0S,My three year old son loved the movie. He sings the songs and asks to wear his underpants just like the little bear. He want's to be a big boy. It has been a very useful tool.,1204502400,,175,3.7567567567567566
2349958,5,B000A1IN0S,"I got this dvd on a whim while shopping at BABIES R US.  We don't watch tv and very few videos but he was 2.5 months old and had occasionally shown interest in going to the potty so I thought this might kick him over the edge.

We watched this about half a dozen times between the span of two months.  When I saw it I thought it was lame.  The sound wasn't that great (we watched it on my laptop) and they skipped things like washing hands which I didn't like.  But he enjoyed it from the first viewing and would have wanted to watch it two or three times in a row if I didn't refuse.

Well, I've come to really appreciate this dvd after awhile.  First, it REALLY did pique his interest in wearing underpants.  I gave it a try but at 2.5 years old he was having too many accidents and I stopped after two days.

Two months later (just this labor day weekend) we gave it another try when he hugged my knees just like the bear did in the dvd and asked to wear underpants again.  I decided I couldn't put it off anymore.  He had been asking and asking the last few weeks.  So we tried it again and used the stickers and lo and behold!  He did great and now, three days into it, he did a BIG poop in the toilet.  He said, ""I made a log poop!""

So we're on our way.  Definitely a jump start to toilet training.

Secondly, this dvd does a good job of getting your kid to relate to the bear. At first, Glen the Bear loves diapers.  A big fuss is made about how nice diapers are.  It turned out to be a good move because my son loves diapers and also if they backslide, it's not like diapers are a bad thing.
They also show Glen counting to 5.  The first time my son saw the dvd he couldn't quite count to 5.  Very soon afterwards he could count to 10 and he was incredulous that Glen couldn't count to 5 easily.  (How quickly they forget.)  So it made him feel confident that he was as big a kid if not bigger than Glen and thus also ready to wear underpants.  Ingenious.

And the songs are catchy even if my son didn't sing with it.

The dvd is a great motivation dvd.  Not very detailed in everything but that's fine with me.  I like him to do things a certain way and I wouldn't want the dvd teaching him to do it differently than I like so glossing over details of toilet training is fine with me.  I consider it a plus.

My only concern is I don't know how well this dvd would do for girls although I'm told it's for both boys and girls.  I certainly felt it slanted towards boys for which I was grateful.",1188777600,2,2503,4.006072874493927
2349959,5,B000A1IN0S,Great potty training dvd. Perfect pace and message for my two-year-old. Great storybook concept. Wish it was available when I potty trained my older one. Reward stickers are great motivator.,1187568000,,190,5.366666666666666
2349960,1,B000A1IN0S,"The first 10 minutes or so talks all about how GREAT diapers are. Not good.

My son loses interest after that and tells me he wants his diapers back.

The movie is also not typical animation. It is narrated with one voice.",1183852800,2,222,4.261904761904762
2349961,1,B000A1IN0S,"This dvd barely worked and didn't do any good. This might be good if your potty training a boy. It is very boy oriented. They need to list it for boys and make a separate one for girls. How can a girl relate to a story about a boy potty training, they are not the same.",1173139200,3,269,3.8214285714285716
2349962,4,B000A1IN0S,This is very close to care bears and the kids love it. They request this video in addition to all the others they love to watch.,1172188800,,128,3.9615384615384617
2349963,2,B000A1IN0S,"The characters are bears - boy bear, his parents, and friend - girl bear. Not every child has a ""Mommy"" & ""Daddy"" - By now we should acknowledge that!

  The potty & big boy pants - songs are way too long! & It would be better if the girl bear also had a big girl pants & potty song too!",1169078400,,287,3.75
2349964,5,B000A1IN0S,Great instructional video that our child completely enjoyed and followed the cute bear character's portrayal of not having to use diapers anymore.  My husband and I are relieved to be rid of the expenses of purchasing diapers and happily ecstatic now that our child has graduated to using under garments.  No money wasted here.,1168646400,,327,5.037037037037037
2349965,5,B000A1IN0S,"I'm not sure I would have personally rated this so great, but my 35 month old daughter can't get enough of this video and it causes her to go on the potty everytime she watches it!  The first time I played it, she asked to see it FIVE times in a row before I insisted we stop watching the tv!  Since then, EVERY time she has watched it, she has gone pee pee on the potty.  Ok, one time she peed on the couch instead of the potty, but hey, all the other times she made it to the potty first!  I checked this out from the library, but ended up buying it when I saw how much she loves it.  It does disturbingly talk about how much the bear loves his diapers at first, but that does not seem to take away from how excited he is when he switches to big boy underwear instead.  My daughter loved her diapers too, so I think it just helps her relate.  She always laughs at that part.  I highly recommend this.",1151625600,9,902,3.9722222222222223
2349966,2,B000A1IN0S,"First, the little bear cub starts talking about how much he LIKES his diapers.  Not a bad thing, but the only real transition or inspiration he gets in wanting to wear underwear is that his neighbor and friend wears them.  There's a lot more going through a 2 or 3 year olds' head than just someone else is doing it.

Second, the characters mouths don't move.  It's a narration, not a cartoon so all the characters have the same voice too.

Last, there really isn't anything that's a catch phrase or song that is useable for training when the movie isn't on.  Other DVDs and movies are more agressive in their training tactics.",1148428800,23,627,4.504424778761062
2349977,5,B000A1IN0S,"My nearly three-year-old son watches this dvd ten times a day. He

walks around with ""big boy"" underwear over his diapers. I can see the diapers will be coming off soon. My favorite part is the sing-along section at the end of video so we can sing the songs together.",1148256000,4,267,4.34
2349978,1,B000A1IN0S,"This video starts out real cute,but they take way too long to get to the point.  The majority of the video talks about how much the little bear loves his diapers and love having ""diaper time"" with his parents.  By the time it gets around to talking about going potty on the toliet, my 2 year old was bored and on to something else.  If anything this video will hinder Potty Training becasue of how much the little bear loves his diapers!",1146441600,5,437,4.304878048780488
2349979,5,B000A1IN0S,I was looking for a video to spike my 2+ year old daughter's interest in potty training and this one did the job beautifully. She loves the story about the little bear and the silly songs and is now asking about a potty and big kid underwear. The video's gentle tone also complements the various potty books I've purchased for bedtime reading. I don't expect an animated video to present the same level of detail as a video with real kids so in contrast to other reviewers it doesn't bother me that the bear doesn't wash his hands(paws?). My husband and I can deliver that message more effectively anyway. This video is a nice soft sell introduction to potty training and I recommend it for that purpose.,1144713600,3,704,4.551181102362205
2349980,1,B000A1IN0S,"Although my 32-month old loves to watch this movie, it has done nothing to further his interest in the potty. I think it spends too much time focusing on how great diapers are and the quality time Glen gets during diaper changes. It would have been nice too, if maybe Glen tried to go potty a time or two with no success, to show that it's okay not to get it on your first try. I know we have tons of tries before we have success. I agree with other reviewers that don't like that it doesn't address wiping or washing hands. We have ordered Potty Power and it should be here anyday...",1144713600,4,584,4.176991150442478
2349981,1,B000A1IN0S,"In this twenty-minute video, the first TEN MINUTES are about HOW GREAT DIAPERS ARE! The little bear loves his diapers, has wonderful quality time with his parents while being diapered, and even sings a song about how great diapers are. For ten minutes! The next ten minutes see the little bear deciding to wear underwar, getting a potty seat, and sitting on the potty once. Then, he's magically potty trained and that's that. Yes, it does have catchy songs, but do you really want your child being treaterd to ten minutes on how fabulous diapers are? This video is a loser. Potty Power is much better in all respects.",1144454400,6,617,4.669724770642202
2349982,2,B000A1IN0S,"My husband, out twin 25-month-olds, and I sat down to watch this video.  We are still introducing the girls to the idea of not using diapers, but what we discovered was that this video is not the way to do it.  Perhaps for older children who are not yet fully potty trained (e.g., a twelve-year-old), this video would be perfect.

The plot begins by introducing Glen, a little bear who is fully verbal.  He speaks in full sentences and paragraphs, and processes ideas in ways that resemble someone much older than a toddler.  (My girls are very bright, and I spend a large amount of time with other young children, so I'm confident in the aforementioned statement.)  Not until almost 11 minutes in is there any mention of a potty, and then it is because Glen's best friend, Sophie, is now wearing underpants.  (By the way, these kids play outside without obvious parental supervision, which just adds to my theory that these aren't young toddlers.)  Glen promptly goes inside and politely demands over lunch that his parents buy him underpants.  They do and tell him that if he's not going to wear a diaper, he has to use the potty.  So he does.  Apparently the potty training process is magical for him (and should be for your child, too!).  All kids who need more than a single brief chat about not peeing in big kid pants are completely inept-- and their parentsare , too.  In all fairness, Glen does suffer from the classic young child problem of getting his pee started, but just that once.  And he doesn't wash his hands afterward, nor is there any mention of wiping.  It also doesn't address a toddler's potty, as opposed to the adult toilet, but that is probably less of an issue for many people, unless the inconsistency between the video and what's going on at home could confuse your child.

Perhaps I am being a bit harsh, as it is just a video and can't replace active parental involvement, but this is not the only potty training video we own; it is only the worst.  I'm giving it a second star only because my girls do find the Bear family rather entertaining.  As for educational value, though, I would definitely recommend a different film.  (Personally, I like ""Potty Power,"" which is a better starting point for fostering 'discussion' with a young toddler regarding using the potty.)",1144108800,4,2302,4.639506172839506
2349983,4,B000A1IN0S,"My 2 year old daughter loves this video. She sings the songs and knows the dialogue. I would have given it 5 stars if she was using the potty yet. For parents, the songs aren't as annoying or embarrassing when you are caught singing them the next day as with most of the other potty videos.",1141257600,3,290,4.196428571428571
2349984,5,B000A1IN0S,"My daughter has asked to watch NO MORE DIAPERS every day since we bought it.  She now wants to wear underpants and understands that if you wear panties you need to use the potty!  The video has definitely sparked her interest in potty training.

The stickers (which were included with the dvd) are a big hit too. She proudly puts them on her potty after each use.",1140912000,3,363,4.388059701492537
2349985,3,B000A1IN0S,"I wasn't sure if anything was going to help my almost three year old son but I think this helped him want to use the toilet. After watching the video, he started to ask for it. He wanted to watch No More Diapers. Although the video was made in 1987 and us adults watching it with him thought, oh my, my son has now started to want to use the toilet. With a few toilet successes so far, there have been times where after he uses the toilet he wants to watch the video and gets so excited singing the songs. All in all it is a great price and helps you take a few steps forward.",1140739200,,576,3.9316239316239314
2349986,5,B000A1IN0S,This dvd delivered on its promise to get my child interested in potty training. He loves the songs and now is asking about big kid underwear. This video introduces potty training through a sweet story line. It's not a nuts and bolts potty training manual..thankfully. My son loves the stickers that came with the dvd and I downloaded the potty sticker chart and coloring book pages. When potty training success is achieved I'll download the very cute potty diploma.,1140652800,,465,4.89873417721519
8072218,5,B000A1IN0S,"My son has autism and really didn't like a lot of other potty training videos I tried. I think he liked this one because you can hear what the bears are saying and see their facial expressions but their mouths don't move (like his other favorites Thomas the tank and ""Gromit"" from the Wallace and Gromit series)...a lot of other videos featured real people (""strangers"" to him) and lots of eye contact, which he literally hatred...this plays more like a story book that a child can watch from a comfortable distance, not a ""hey you! Yeah,  you! Come potty with us!"" situation...lol",1447200000,,581,4.696078431372549
8072219,4,B000A1IN0S,It's Cute but doesn't show going to the potty enough. It's a great starter movie though and then maybe get another one that has more about going potty.,1436313600,,151,4.428571428571429

8072222,3,B000A1IN0S,"I have been looking for potty training videos for my daughter that don't use ""pull ups"" as I don't intend to use them. I think they are a waste of money. We are using training panties & plastic pants. My daughter seems to pick up things quite well from educational cartoons so I wanted to try it for potty training as well. That said, this video was not a good choice. First, they put too much emphasis on how great diapers are. Not exactly the message I want to get across. There is even a song about diapers being great. Second, this would cater more towards boys than girls as the bear learning to go potty is a boy. The girl bear they show on the cover is his neighbor and she only is in the story a couple times when he goes out to play. He does get the idea of wanting to wear underwear when he finds out she is wearing them, but I wouldn't say its enough to make it more girl friendly. Third, they really don't show him using the potty except at the very end when his mom brings home a potty seat for the big toilet. I'm trying to teach my daughter to use her little potty first as she is too scared to sit on her seat that goes on the big toilet. I would think that would be true of most toddlers her age (she's a few days shy of being 2). All in all, I really was not impressed with this video and thought it to be terrible for trying to encourage her to use the potty.",1363046400,,1378,3.996376811594203

I have not pushed or tried to make him go in the poty but he tells me that he wants to go and he goes, I was so suprised.
