2925900,4,B000UVV2C4,"Here is the final installment of the series. The animation was just as high quality as ""prophecy"". Of course the details of the storyline are revealed in this installment. As is common with much anime, the grand idea of rebirth/salvation/renewal/hope is the strong message in this series. Creative and satisfying to watch.",1195862400,,322,5.211538461538462
2925901,5,B000UVV2C4,"I will be relative short with my review about the second part of Karas (but view spoilers will be included).

To begin with, the series starts off exactly where the previous one stopped. Now, Otoha (the main protagonist - and the `good' Karas - is respectively stripped of his powers) and his cat-girl is imprisoned. On top of that, Eko - the bad Karas - has almost accomplished his plans. No matter the circumstances, Otoha will head out with his friend (the guy who is a daemon as well, I think Nue was his name) for their final stand so as to stop Eko and his foes.
This will result to mind-blowing action scenes, flashbacks and therefore, more character development, both worlds (the spiritual and the material) will start to collide, the city will be annihilated during the fights, the new awakening of Karas and his cat-girl (something that you have to watch or otherwise I will give away the entire story), the Karas of the entire nation will come into the picture as well, protagonists/characters will die (well, unfortunately it will happen) but most of all it will lead to one of the best final and action packed battles of the anime series.

One more thing (Spoiler!!!) In a scene, close to the final battle it is implied that the feelings of `master and servant/helper/warrior (or whatever you want to call it)', cat-girl and Karas (referring to the cat-girl and Otoha), are deeper than they may appear at first...

Now, to the other details.

The dub is done perfectly as it was done in the first part.
The animation lives up to the expectations of the previous one.
The story starts to kick off from the first minute; in addition most answers will be answered, answers that were raised during the first volume - not to mention the fact that it gets emotional too.
The music is similar to the one people got used from the first Karas.

As for the extras, it has nearly the typical stuffs like previews and a view shots when the actors did the dub.

Well, all this been said Karas presents itself to be one of the best fantasy-action movies that came out recently and is definitely worth buying...

To conclude, this one (Karas - The Prophecy) and its continuation, (Karas - The Revelation) are highly recommended!!!",1195344000,2,2228,4.6395939086294415
2925902,5,B000UVV2C4,"I have been an anime fan for years and I will have to say that Karas is easily one of the best anime movies to come from Mango since ninja scroll!  I know that is bold and very strong talk, however, if you buy Karas you will understand.
1.  Story - the story is pretty interesting for what it is.  Demons and humans have a clash of sorts and Karas basically keeps the peace.  The characters are interesting, the main character himself is especially mysterious and you can ally feel the characters feelings.
2.  Animation - Beyond words!  I cannot be more impressed.  When I saw Final Fantasy XII I almost soiled myself, but Karas...In the words of Neo from the Matrix ""Woah""  The integration of 3d animation with 2d animation is nearly seemless, not to mention the combat in the series. I mean Newton, Einstein, and Boyle have to be rolling in their grave because of the physics defying action.  The studio also brings in new concepts of speed and strength, and a new way to exemplify them.

Overall this was an amazing anime and I DEMAND A SERIES OR ANOTHER MOVIE POST HASTE!!!",1193270400,5,1078,4.482051282051282
2925903,4,B000UVV2C4,"Karas: Revelations is the conclusion of the story of this new Anime icon.  The movie was really beautiful and offers even more eye candy than the original.  The violence has doubled in this movie and there is finally closure in Otaha's and Nue's character, which was appreciated.  The revelations made about Otoha are quite disturbing to say the least and one can wonder if it was even necessary.

I do have a few gripes about it, and that is the last battle was not as good as I had hoped it to be. In my opinion, there wasn't enough martial arts or sword play (which I loved about part 1 especially the first Karas fight).

Regardless of my own personal tastes, I believe this Anime sets the bar for CG-Anime fusion and any welcome sequel to this remarkeable series will definitely be on my 'to-buy' list.",1193270400,,807,4.5
2925904,3,B000UVV2C4,"Imagine a Batman-like superhero who did nothing to actually stop crime but showed up every now and then to trash half the city in a battle with some super-villain, killing innocent bystanders in the process...that is Karas.  Some stories are best kept untold (or partially told and left to imagination) and I can't help but get that feeling after watching the conclusion of the Karas story.  Karas is a grand presentation of a lame, shallow story.  The production values are very high and the action scenes are very enjoyable but as any anime fan knows, a great anime cannot stand on high budget visuals alone without good storytelling.  The second half of the Karas story maintains the same fast-paced action sequences but the scenes seem to be just a little less polished and the overall presentation just a little less engaging than the first half.  Overall I was disappointed with the conclusion of the story and the long delay of its release adds to the disappointment.",1193184000,2,974,4.843373493975903
2925905,4,B000UVV2C4,"The story picks up right from the ending of Karas: the prophecy.

Just as a quick review of what I think about this second part:

- the story is straight forward, explains pretty much every ""mystery"" the first part set up

- feels like there's slightly less action, but definitely more story telling

- still beautiful graphic, great action and exceptional music score

I can't really think of any cons about the movie. Yet the ending is somewhat a let down. It is a great closure, but it just feels like there should be more.

Karas absolutely has the potential to be made into a series, in which case the audience coule have a better chance to fully appreciate the story. I guess my disappointing feeling came from the fact that a story with such potential to have deep characters development and complex story line is squeezed into a three hours movie.

Karas, nonetheless, is a great anime that should not be missed by anime fans. The first part (the prophecy) definitely requires a bit thinking, but if you can overcome it you'll find yourself enjoying one of the best action animes.",1193097600,4,1088,4.635416666666667
2925906,5,B000UVV2C4,This is the second set of 3 of a 6 part ova dealing with otoha and his fight agains the mechanized demons.  This has to be one of the best anime OVA series i have ever seen.  A lot of the series seems like they sat down with a stack of money and said what can we do that will look cool?  and then they did it while spinning it all together with a great story.  The climatic ending of the series is just as good as the introduction fight of the series.  Anyone who enjoys anime i suggest picking this complete set up.  I even noticed they are selling a set that includes all six parts.  buy it today.,1193097600,,599,3.941666666666667
2925907,5,B000UVV2C4,"I saw the subtitled version of the movie at one of the recent anime cons.  It was excellent!  Animation is still stunning and the story piks up right where the last movie ended.  The cliffhanger ending of the last film was confusing due to so many unanswered questions.  But Revelation answered most of the questions, though still a complicated/sophisticated plot.  The middle third actually takes a very dark turn plus it is much more bloody than Prophecy...which was fine by me.",1189036800,22,480,4.8765432098765435

2925909,5,B000UVV2C4,"I love Karas ever since I played him in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom the video game. The 2 movies are so cool to watch and they fetaure some wonderful animation and sequences. The first part may be a little weak due to the story confusion, but this movie helps reveal many things and build up to a grand climax. One of my favorite films now.",1377993600,,333,4.21875

2925912,4,B000UVV2C4,"I originally bought Karas ""The Prophecy"" back when it was released and never was able to find Revelation when it came out.  Recently, I figured I'd look again and here it was.  It completes the story, of course, however I wasn't exactly as pleased as I thought I'd be with it.  It's still good, however, the first installment seems to be my favorite of the two.",1364688000,,361,4.4393939393939394
2925913,1,B000UVV2C4,"""Karas - The Prophesy"" is excellent.
It gets better every time that I experience it.
It had some sense of balance, an equilibrium.
It was only a matter of time before I checked out
""Karas - The Revelation"".

What a mess!
There was the foundation for a very interesting plot
and the animation was technically excellent.
The producers must think that art is throwing
all kinds of crazy stuff at people and wowing
them with sensory overload.
I felt psychologically abused by the end of the movie.

2 stars for expertise in animation and
0 stars for the end product yields a
1 star review for the movie.

Hoping that these animation geniuses will use
their talents for worthwhile projects in the
future. What a waste if they don't.",1361145600,,727,4.62015503875969

2925916,5,B000UVV2C4,This anime is the second half of the movie Karas- The Prophecy. This anime had the climax of the battle of Karas and the main antagonist who plans to harm both humans and spirits of the world. This anime does contain some forms of gore so I don't recommend this anime for young children. I highly recommend this anime t o any hardcore anime fans or anyone who has seen Karas- The Prophecy and wants to see the end.,1356912000,,414,4.253164556962025
2925917,5,B000UVV2C4,It perfect!!!!!!  Lots of action and great soundtrack.  Some nicesub-plots and endering charaters.  awesome special effects on par with Vampire Hunter D:  Bloodlust!,1313971200,,165,6.043478260869565

2925919,2,B000UVV2C4,"After watching Karas: The Prophecy, which ends on a cliffhanger and which I thoroughly enjoyed, I was pretty excited about seeing the conclusion.  Unfortunately, this movie falls short in so many ways.

The quality of the visual effects and fight scenes just don`t come close to the first movie.  Even the soundtrack is noticeably worse (nothing from the Prague Philharmonic in this one).  Otoha's back story was also disappointing.  It seemed like it was just slapped together without much thought.  It's hard to go into specifics without giving away the plot, but basically you see the main villain getting more and more powerful and a lot of blood and a lot of destruction without any of it having much sense or purpose.  Again, the fight scenes weren't much to look at.  On the plus side, everything from the first movie is explained clearly.

The bonus material (interview with Cree Summer in the voice over booth) is probably the one redeeming quality of this DVD if you have an interest in that sort of thing.

If you watched Karas: The Prophecy and want to know how it ends, I'd recommend to just read the synopsis on Wikipedia instead of sitting through this 90 minute movie.",1229817600,2,1184,4.759803921568627
2925920,3,B000UVV2C4,"Karas - The Revelation is the follow up to Karas - The Prophecy. I purchased this product with no research simply because I loved the first one so much. The Revelation picks up right where Prophecy left off and concludes the storyline. Unfortunately, Revelation and Prophecy have very different narrative styles. I was a fan of The Prophecy because of its experimental plot development, its non linear progression, its understated characters, and the pressure on viewers to piece plot devices together with very little guidance. It made for a very unique anime full of WTF moments that broke a lot of sterotypes and traditons. The Revelation, however, has little to none of this experimental storyline. The Revelation is a much more traditional anime film, everything is explained in clear matter of fact speeches. Information is clear and concise so there is none of the previous feeling that you are an active viewer. The fight sequences aren't nearly as epic or abrupt and look far more like traditonal sword fights than in The Prophecy. Despite these changes in style The Revelation is a great movie and when you strip it of your expectations from The Prophecy you realize its still a good story, its just not as ground breaking. The movie answers a lot of questions, and makes some pretty interesting statements. While not as good as Karas - The Prophecy, I would recommend any Karas fan buy this movie. Anyone who didn't care for the first one, or doesnt know what Karas is should skip this purchase.",1213574400,,1506,4.863813229571984
2925921,5,B000UVV2C4,Most excellent anime in a while. I loved the fact that the story lines had so many twist in it. it keep you on your feet.,1213228800,,121,3.6923076923076925
2925922,3,B000UVV2C4,"Pretty animation, unimpressively violent. Eh.
I watched it on recommendation and it's pretty much the standard ""fighting robot anime"" (if anyone uses the word ""mecha"", I will bean them).  Entertaining, but has about as much depth as a punctured kiddy pool.

Don't be too surprised at the ending; I certainly wasn't.",1202428800,,315,5.1568627450980395
2925923,5,B000UVV2C4,"The action is a bit more personal in this one, but choreographed just as well. Not to mention the story of how a Karas comes to be is fully explained here. the life Otoha led before he became a Karas, how Nue turned on the demons and why, and what is is that Lord Eko really wants.

action and gore leaves you asking for little more. Beautiful like the 1st.",1202342400,,357,4.1
2925924,2,B000UVV2C4,"Call me picky, but the only substantial thing The Revelation did for me was explain a lot of what happened in The Prophecy. They take about ten to fifteen minutes to do this and that was good. But overall, compared to The Prophecy, The Revelation is a disappointment.

The action (admit it, is there another primary reason to have watched Karas?) is nearly nonexistent. What little action does occur happens like it does in most other mundane anime: Big, dusty explosions that conceal all vision, single sword strokes, etc. The elaborateness of the fight scenes is completely gone.

The graphic quality changes from the first one too, and not for the better. The superb blending between CG and hand drawing that made the first one so beautiful is markedly gone. You end up with an awkward non(mix) of CG and hand drawings, with the hand drawings resembling typical anime (though in the upper tier) and CG reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons like Beast Machines. And after watching The Prophecy, that's a letdown.

Basically, Karas: The Prophecy (the first volume) is an exceptional anime. Karas: The Revelation is just anime.",1199491200,3,1130,4.968253968253968
2925925,4,B000UVV2C4,"This a very good anime, but i'm the type that needs a little more explaination. There was hole in the ending, is there going to be another?

2925926,5,B000UVV2C4,I found Karas Revelation to be very action packed anime. It complements the first movie very well. If anyone had any problems understanding the first one I think that you'll find your answers solved. So if you really like big action fight scenes you'll find Karas Revelation to be the right one for you.,1197590400,,303,4.62962962962963
2925927,5,B000UVV2C4,Great sequel. Wish it wasn't the end to a great two movie wonder. For a great anime that's fast paced and awesome cg you need to watch this movie.,1196380800,,146,4.068965517241379
8215231,5,B000UVV2C4,"Karas is badass!  I only wish there was more. I NEED more. Anyway, this is the second part to Karas, the Prophecy. Therefore if you buy the first one, you must get this second one so you're not left hanging. I say get it because it's worth watching.",1517875200,,249,4.1875

8215235,5,B000UVV2C4,"This is an epic conclusion to one of the most unique original video animes (OVA). Not only is the the first movie, The Prophecy, exciting and action packed, it's also extremely confusing. Part 2, The Revelation, fills in the story gaps thus making the overall plot much easier to understand. I'm not going to go into explaining the story since other people have already done that. What I will say, though, is that The Prophecy is epic story telling at its finest. It is true that the movie is a little slow at times since it is doing exposition that probably should've been told in The Prophecy. At times the animation is not as vibrant or fluid when compared to The Prophecy, but when taken as a whole, these are just minor issues that don't really detract from the thrilling epic story telling that is The Prophecy and The Revelation.",1441843200,,836,4.58
8215236,4,B000UVV2C4,"After the battle in the hospital which saw Yurine abducted and Karas human body Otoha awakening from his coma. Lord Eko continues with his plan to remake the city. After Nue regains consciousness, he explains to Otoha the purpose and responsibilities of Yurine and Karas. He also reveals that Eko is in fact the former Karas who once protected the city and why he stepped down.-summary

Karas: The Revelation for the most part does exactly what is expected of a grand finale. It provides closure by answering all of the nagging questions, adds character background, and ties up the subplot as well. I just can't help notice this story format is very similar to Quinten Tarantino's Kill Bill. The first volume mostly provided stylish action, while the second was more character and story driven. This series followed the exact same pattern as Kill Bill. I'm not knocking it for this, it's just very easy to notice.

The very first thing fans of the original will immediately notice is that the visuals which are still outstanding, are also a step down as well done in a more traditional style. Even though the animation and artwork isn't as captivating anymore. It still delivers and blows away many titles which are in the class of top notch. The action scenes are still exciting to watch, which consist of plenty of hand to hand combat via swordplay as well as airborne shootouts. The character designs are still incredible with some amazing artwork for the metal warriors and gigantic beast, with well detailed backgrounds and nice color schemes; but I have to mention that the animation is not close to perfect anymore. I did detect a small amount of stills in some of the background, and I don't believe for one second it was used in an artistic way. Some may feel it's nitpicking but that's just me.

The writers didn't pay full attention to its characters. Character background does not equate to character development, unless the character reflects on his past, and it causes him/her to become either a better or worst individual. None of the characters truly broke any molds. Therefore, I don't believe they were properly fleshed out.

One character in particular that I feel was hurt had to be Eko. He had the most realistic drive; he was the former protector of the city and after many years of protecting mankind he simply changed. I understood what the writers were shooting for, but I feel his background shouldn't have been in a verbal format. To keep things simple, it just could have been better. Personally, I needed something to truly make me feel for him. Overall, I feel he was misused and it was the lack of creativity on the writers part. On a side note, when I think of Eko, I often wonder what Batman would do if he tripped out and said, ""the hell with it all"".

On the plus side, everyone whom watches this will notice a huge addition of brutal and bloody gore. I was surprised at the amount of blood shed that was displayed when compared to the first one. One scene especially came out of left field and is very disturbing to watch; but at least the action and build up to the end, plus the ending itself was well worth the trip.

Karas: The Revelation was a very good follow up and a nice way to cap off a good series. While the first part seems to be aimed more towards the die hard fan. The continuation appears to be fine even for the casual viewer. I won't recommend this to everyone as a must see, but die hard otakus should check it out. This chapter has a 90 minute run time.

Pros: Provides closure, great animation, gory scenes

Cons: Animation is a step down, most characters never break their mold, villain not properly analyzed",1428105600,,3666,4.620583717357911
