2836874,1,B000QEIO8U,"Although the CD was wrapped nicely, the CD does not work at all and I tried different CD players.  Its just not worth the effort to re-package and send it back. I'm done ordering on line though Amazon.",1213488000,,201,4.2894736842105265
2836875,5,B000QEIO8U,"Pastor Marvin never ceases to amaze me with his vocal talent. THe band is slamming and the worship is excellent. Plus back ups from New Breed, what more you want",1207612800,,161,4.4
2836876,5,B000QEIO8U,Well done as usual.  The music is wonderful Gospel music.  You'll be blessed.  Marvin does all things well.  You won't be disappointed.,1200355200,,135,5.0
2836877,5,B000QEIO8U,"One of my top video purchases in 2007. Uplifting songs. Powerful performances. Flawless audio and lighting. An anointed music ministry! I have to buy the CD for my car and my Ipod.

2836878,5,B000QEIO8U,Very good DVD. I love all the work Marvin Sapp does.  God has truly blessed this man to be a worshiper,1192579200,,102,3.857142857142857
2836879,5,B000QEIO8U,"Marvin Sapp, with his throaty tenor voice commands attention and is not easily over powered by the band and background singers.  The DVD is well produced...lighting, staging and sound.  Every instrument and voice is blended and layered as a perfect bed for Marvin's voice.  Aaron Lindsay's, KEYS, MD and Calvin Rodgers'(DRUMS)musicianship really shine. The music as well as the vocal arrangements appear to have been worked on meticulously... every nuance adds to the overall presentation.  This should now be the benchmark on how live concert DVDs should be produced.

""MAGNIFY"",  an up tempo with a funky groove opens up the event. Out of the gate Marvin states what he wants to happen....to magnify the Lord and make Him ""great in this place'.  When that is your aim, you cannot fail in any endeavor because God will give you ""POWER"" to ""POSSESS THE LAND"" !

outstanding songs: Magnify, Rivers Flow, Never Would Have Made It, Praise Him In Advance",1189468800,4,950,4.968354430379747
2836880,4,B000QEIO8U,Another good product by Minister Marvin.  Each song was well thought out and the arrangements are off the chain. My money was well spent.,1187222400,2,137,4.708333333333333
2836881,4,B000QEIO8U,"I really like Marvin's perspective and interpretation through music on ""Worship"". His ten/alto voice range adds definition and depth to the lyrics that set the tone for worship. I waffled between a 3 & 4 star rating. I love his past music but this album/DVD seemed a little slow for me. The main song, ""Never Would Have Made It""...makes up for it all...and is definatley the seller. If you're going thru...you need this album/DVD set it on that song and hit the repeat button for hours of going up into His (Jesus) presence with Praise and Grattitude...Because without Him...I would never had made it.",1186272000,5,601,4.788461538461538
2836882,5,B000QEIO8U,"Thirsty is a cd that takes you right into the presence of God. The songs will have you enter right into the presence of God like never before, rather you're in your bedroom, at work, in the living room where ever you may be. This cd is awesome, it's a must have for everyone. I have all of Marvin Sapp's music but by far this one takes you into the holy of holies, a rheme in the spirit that reaches the third heaven. One of my favorites on the cd is ""Never would of made it without you"".",1185148800,2,488,3.989795918367347
