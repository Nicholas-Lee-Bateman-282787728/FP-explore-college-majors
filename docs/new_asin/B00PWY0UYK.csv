8689585,3,B00PWY0UYK,"I enjoyed the movie because the actresses are mother and daughter in ""real life"";  furthermore the daughter, Pascal, died quite young and she was a lovely and talented actress.  The scenes of Paris (the entire move is outside) are, for the most part,  interesting to me plus the sound of the French language.  It is just that the movie goods on and on (over 2 hours) with a plot that is thin.  It is still an interesting and unusual movie that I enjoyed in its own terms.",1494028800,,471,4.367816091954023
8689586,5,B00PWY0UYK,"Two women,strangers to each other,Marie and Baptiste,meet up by chance and wander the streets of Paris. Rivette has taken an actress well known to him(Bulle Ogier) to act the part,largely through improvisation,of ex-con Marie,who is claustrophobic and cannot bare to go inside closed spaces. The principle of construction is like Celine and Julie Go Boating,day 1,day 2,day 3,day 4. Marie's mission is to find true love,she is driven by paranoid fictions, seeing Paris as a sprawling game-board marked off with tucked-away conspiracies,a return by Rivette to old subject matter,to retrace his steps. The film is a spiral drawn on a map of the city for a Game of the Goose. Between labyrinths and traps,fears and yearnings,there is a constant evocation of perpetual movement of ""theoreticalfight against imaginary enemies"",taken up by Baptiste(Pascale Ogier,Bulle's actual daughter),a knife-wielding,self-proclaimed karate expert with a drive to slash the eyes of faces in adverts.,who accompanies Marie on her quest to solve the mystery behind the contents of her former lover's,Julien's(Pierre Clementi's)suitcase:an amalgam of newspaper clippings about abductions,killings,robberies,and maps of Paris that points to an unsettling labyrinth of signs and portents whose endgame is unclear.

Now all the above is very much a Maguffin in a film that is beautifully shot by cinematographer Lubtchansky of post-revolutionary Paris. This works due to the natural chemistry of its leading ladies,their interaction,the nature of imagination and memory through a play-within-a-film,the question of what is going to happen to the ladies,the unfolding itinerary of derelict sites,building sites,railway lines,a Paris being destroyed and reconstructed,brought alive through the creativity of play. Baptiste has totalitarian fantasies of being watched by eyes,lions,dragons,spies('Max's) which she fights like Sancho Panza. Cinema for Rivette is closer to dreams and illusions, living through our desires,but true because we aspire to recreate these dreams in real life. They have to build an imaginary life in a city that is falling apart. They are both caught up in the board game,Somewhere-Else-in-Gooseland. The adventures of the actual shoot mirrors the adventures of the characters. No artificial lighting,fiction that courses through the streets,refused the refuge of enclosed space,use of reportage methods as if surprise was paramount. Everything is seen through the eyes of the 2 heroines. The project mixes the memory of our heroes and situations in Don Quixote. .The concrete and scrap-iron city is like a desert(or ghost-town),the Indians(the Max's)are everywhere,there's shelter to be found at night,places to get some water,a compass, showdowns. Rivette takes the blow torch of his genius to scrap metal revealing the hidden structures,painting a tableau of France from his own tower. Breath-taking.",1479254400,3,2902,5.828235294117647
