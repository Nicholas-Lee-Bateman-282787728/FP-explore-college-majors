8156435,5,B000KGGODG,"I saw this show on tv not too long ago and thought it was neat, but it was about other breeds that I was not so interested in.  I knew that it could take a while to see the shows on the breeds I wanted to see, so I purchased it from here.  The dvd's are about 30 mins long.  We just bought a Rottweiler puppy not long ago, so this dvd was pretty neat to learn about their history, character, etc.  I think anyone who owns a fullbred dog would enjoy this show on that particular breed.",1204070400,,484,3.9081632653061225
