These old classics aren't always taught in school, so you have a chance to see the story at home. Homer would be glad to see a new generation enjoy his story.",1287532800,2,272,4.25
8344191,4,6303037909,I have been a great fan of the classic story of the Odyssey by Homer since I was a child.  I've introduced the Odyssey to my four year old son with books geared mainly for older children which have been too violent or too adult in theme.  I found this re-telling of the odyssey in cartoon format to be perfect for my four year old.  It tells the rather violent episodes of the odyssey in a less violent and gentle way.  The music and voices are heroic and exciting.  The animation is realistic and well done.  This video did a good job of introducing this timeless classic for children and I would recommend it for children 3 years and older. I and my four year old son had a good time and enjoyed the video.,1133395200,,708,4.207407407407407
