8246247,4,B0012JJO9G,"This dvd brought back memories of the historic OJ trial when I was finding it hard to recall all the various lawyers involved. It is clear and concise - and I originally thought there would be more of the trial itself, but it was so many days ongoing, I am better off with this clear and interesting summation.",1397260800,,310,4.362068965517241
8246248,4,B0012JJO9G,The dvd was of great quailty and I would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing this to refresh their memory. The only thing is I wish they had the whole series.,1397174400,2,166,4.21875
8246249,2,B0012JJO9G,"This DVD includes the closing arguments and nothing more. Not even the prosecution's final rebuttal which is always crucial to the jury's decision.
Not worth much, historically speaking.
Pretty much a waste of money.",1395273600,2,216,5.382352941176471
