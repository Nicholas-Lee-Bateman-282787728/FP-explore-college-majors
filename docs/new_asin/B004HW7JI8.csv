You will need to watch S.1 first before you watch this season or you would be lost lol. I love the series, its amazing. But everyone has different taste. On S.2 the girls (Aria,Hanna,Spencer,Emily) are still being stalked  by A. Their parents force them to see a therapist which then advises that the girls spend time away from each other, they each have a love but things are up and down with that....etc..at the end they find out who 'A' is. There is so much more that goes on, but I don't want to spoil it..lol",1460073600,,625,4.1652892561983474

4380749,5,B004HW7JI8,Season 2 of Pretty Little Liars starts off with a huge bang. It literally pushes every character to their breaking point. It really makes each character think whether or not they are A. This DVD is worth owning.,1401840000,,211,4.578947368421052

4380756,4,B004HW7JI8,"i initially watched this because netflix said i would like it due to my interest in veronica mars (a neo noir teen melodrama).
this is not much like that. i won't summarize the plot because you can get that elsewhere. i will just say that this is the most honest depiction of young female friendships i have ever seen on a tv show. family relationships are also a major theme.
the mystery part of the show is ridiculous. in addition to the threats and harassment people keep getting murdered and these girls don't turn to drink or drugs or commit suicide or go to the cops? whaaaaaat?! haha. like i said great stuff about relationships. but you can't watch it for the suspense or mystery...you will be disappointed.
i guess i should also mention that these are four of the more beautiful human beings on tv. and if you add in their love interests (bianca lawson, ian harding, drew van acker etc.) one could argue this show has the most beautiful people on it hands down.",1392422400,4,970,4.517045454545454

I don't know it is just one of those days and it helps. thanks to you writers for helping me get my mind off my life,1392249600,2,645,3.607142857142857

4380781,5,B004HW7JI8,"I never know exactly what's happening in this show and I think that's what keeps me coming back. The surprises, the intrigue, the secrets and plot twits are maddeningly good. By the end of each episode your head is spinning because you have as many questions as you do answers. It's like a drug. You just have to know more. Every cast member plays their part incredibly well and it's impossible not to get caught up in the plot.",1383436800,2,428,4.430379746835443
4380782,4,B004HW7JI8,"I enjoyed watching this show. I do think if you are concerned about exposure to stories of pre marital sexual relationships or teacher/student affairs you need to keep this show away from your kids. I definitely do not condone the story line of Aria & Mr Fitz's on going affair. I do hope this is the end of that story line. I believe Mr Fitz's character should have shown some & ended the relationship as soon as he found out Aria's true age. Other than that, it has alot of interesting twists and turns. Older teens can understand the ins & outs. Does teach that deception has a price and can be worse than dealing with the consequences of telling the truth immediately. Lies always get worse with age.",1383177600,,704,4.465116279069767

4380788,5,B004HW7JI8,Im from Australia and recently went to Warner Bros studios and did the tour. We went to the set of Pretty Little Liars and i felt so out of it as I had never heard of the show. When i arrived at my friends place to stay I saw PLL was on netflicks so thought I'd watch an episode so i could see the set i visited. I was hooked and have been staying up till 2am watching the series. I have loved it so much that i ordered the 3 seasons available and will wait impatiently for season 4 to be released on DVD.

4380794,5,B004HW7JI8,"I initially started the series on tv, but had conflicts with other programming so I only watched a few episodes and considered reading the books instead.  Then they renewed for a fifth season before season four even began, so I immediately bought seasons 1 and 2 (season 3 wasn't out yet).  I'm hooked so far.  I just hope they manage to keep it mysterious and interesting without being too repetitive.",1374710400,,402,4.714285714285714

I'm up to speed on all the goings on. Also interesting to note how some seemingly small things in prior episodes come back into play later.

I duno just wished they actually had someone who could help them end this craziness or for them to tell the truth on what happened that night!!!!

It is a great form of entertainment as long as I don't watch it too close to bedtime or I'm too cortisol-ed up to sleep.

4380824,5,B004HW7JI8,"I really enjoyed both the first and second seasons of this.  Once I started watching, I couldn't stop!  It is an interesting murder mystery type show.  It does have some inappropriate context that one might want to be careful of if you let your youngster watch it as a high school student dates her teacher.  It also has a girl who figures out that she is gay and comes out to her family.  I wouldn't suggest this for anyone younger than 13 and even then it would depend on how you as a parent feel about some of the issues.  The current season on TV however has gotten boring.  They push the ""A"" thing too far and I feel the first 2 seasons are great but season 3 is not that good.",1363996800,,682,4.121212121212121

4380861,5,B004HW7JI8,"DVD: Picture Quality is very good (also in the night/dark scenes) and also the sound is very good for a DVD.
Subtitles: yes: English SDH and any other languages.
Bonus features: 3 short documentaries + deleted scenes.

The Show: A-mazing. After the last episode of season 1: ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" (a nice reference to a movie with the same title ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" (1943) with Gary Cooper) the body of Ian (Ryan Merryman) is gone.

Is Ian death? Or still living? ""A"" is back. More lies and more surprises. You think it coulnd't be better after Season one?. No. Its better. Do have the relationship of Ezra/Aria a chance? Who know. Do we find out now who ""A"" is? Maybe.

Again: the cast is great. Again: Holly Marie Combs, Laura Leighton and as guest: Annabeth Gish (grand-daughter of one of the biggest silent movie star: Lilian Gish), Andrea Parker (""Pretender"", ""Desperate Housewives"").

Also this season has a nice homage to a ""famous"" classic movie (""Psycho"", ""The Bad Seed"").

FAZIT: Watch it, its by far worth it!!!",1355097600,,1032,4.711111111111111

4380874,4,B004HW7JI8,"After season 1's finale with Ian and the bell tower, I was excited to see more of the mystery unraveling in season 2. The story continues with A's antics causing rifts between the girls and their family and significant others. I definitely found this season creepier than the last with scenes in a haunted house, a murky lake, and a doll hospital. A continues to be one step ahead of the girls, always threatening to release a secret or damage a relationship. As everyone comes under suspicion, the identity of A is finally revealed in the season finale...or so it seems...

I took off one star for this season only because I felt like some of the mystery was spiraling out of control. It was hard to keep track of all the suspected characters and where they were at different times and how they relate back to the clues. It also seemed like many of the arguments the central characters have with their parents or loved ones continually repeat to the point of exhaustion. I'm still excited to start the third season but I hope to see some fresh faces or at least some clarity about many of the characters.",1347926400,,1105,4.525

4380880,1,B004HW7JI8,I can't complain about the shipping as this arrived ahead of time. I was also excited to see that there was the UltraViolet digital copy. However when going to redeem the digital copy I was advised that the redemption code had already been used. When talking to the digital copy company they advised the season is more likely counterfeit. Upon further review I notice that 4 out of the 6 disc's have huge scratches on them!!! They will not even attempt to play!!! I am now going to have to spend more money to get good discs that will actually play!!!! Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!! The season cannot be labeled as new and have scratches on the discs like it has been open. NEVER WILL I BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!!!!!,1346803200,4,719,4.538461538461538

It has drama and relationships, but that isn't the main point of the show. It is just part of it. I will watch it until the end. I want to know what happened to Alison. Everyone should watch this if they like suspense.",1343347200,,493,4.2
4380890,5,B004HW7JI8,"Loved the first series and watched the second series and decided that I wanted them as part of my collection of movies and t.v. series. Our local library had part one so I've been able to watch it at my leasure and really enjoyed the first season so when season 2 came out I had told my family that I wanted it for Christmas but they surprised me and ordered both seasons for me just because they could. Great quality and great service as it arrived within 6 days of them ordering and was perfect. This show gets better and better and although the books are very different from the televison show, it's so much fun to watch and to lose yourself an episode at a time. I had planned on waiting for the price to come down but when I looked at our stores prices, Amazon and it's sellers were $20.00 cheaper than the cheapest store price so it was a good deal all around. Having a large selection of things to watch at our home when it's convient for us is a big plus and having Pretty Little Liars seasons 1 and 2 is quite enjoyable for me, especially the price. Being able to pause and rewind and catch something I may have missed when watching it the first or second time is wonderful and this series has certainly kept me guessing as to who will ""A"" really turn out to be. Love the books but love the television show more. Good job guys.",1343174400,,1336,4.22265625

4380897,4,B004HW7JI8,"The mysterious intrigue continues in season 2.

Four teenaged friends with diverse interests and talents must work together to solve the identity of the mysterious A, who stalks their lives and sends threatening messages.

The plot thickens in this season as more potential suspects come out of the woodwork.  The girls try to navigate everyday pressures such as boyfriends, parents, and homework . . . while trying not to fall into A's deadly traps.

Some of the plot points start to get a bit tired in this season and some things are a bit too over the top, but overall it still captures your interest.

A is finally unmasked at the end of the season, but season three (which has just started playing on television) promises new mysteries!",1339545600,3,741,4.7578125
4380898,4,B004HW7JI8,"No matter how much better I liked this season of Pretty Little Liars better than the first season I had to give it 3 1/2 stars. There were both good and bad things about this show. I liked how we found out more shocking secrets and the show is suspensful especially the big secret about Spencers family and who A was and one good twist was there is an A team so theres more people involved in texting the girls nasty messages and that these people might have been involved in the murder of Alison. What was dissapointing was somebody was also killed off ""supposedly"" in the show and while it wasn't who I expected to get killed off it was kind of dissapointing. What really annoyed me is that if you're like me and you've read the book series, ABC Family fooled us into thinking that A wasn't who A was in the first 4 books and that got on my nerves because I expected someone different. But all in all this was a great season. However I do have to mention one important thing. Parents I suggest that you don't let younger teenagers or teenagers that are impressionable watch this. Because there is a student teacher reltionship going on with Aria and Mr. Fitz and the show is making it look okay which it shouldn't. And parents might not like some of the unrealistic things the parents of Aria do. One thing is Arias father gets a job for Ezra far away from Rosewood despite wanting to call the police on him. What is he waiting for? And the fact that Arias mother doesn't want to call the police because they don't want the police in their lives again and doesn't want Aria to elope with him but at the same time she doesn't want Aria to be with the teacher. But really theres no other way except to call the police and get the teacher away from Aria. There is also a scene where Aria and Mr. Fitz are having sex but its not explicit and they just show them kissing and about to take their clotes off but the sex scene isn't intense. But talk to your kids and tell them most of the stuff in that show is unrealistic especially the parents not doing much about the student teacher relationship.",1337904000,5,2095,4.3063291139240505

4380900,5,B004HW7JI8,"Ah, my friends, A is bAck and better then ever. Season 2 is just as good as season 1.  A is back and causing trouble for our pretty little liars, and A isn't plAying any games. A targets each of the pretty little liars, and has a special plan for them. The closer Aria, Spencer, Emily and Hanna gets to A, the more A turns up the heat. However, A isn't all the PLL's have to worry about.  Hanna has family issues she has to deal with, Aria has some extra credit smooches with someone (and if you've seen season 1, you know who it is) and A tries to expose it., Emily has to deal with a person she loves, and Spencer learns some dark secrets from her family's past. People aren't who they seem to be or aren't really who they say the are.  The PLL's are determined to corner A and have A reveAled, the problem is that A is waiting from them.

The PLL's also dig deep into Allison's disappearance in hopes to find out what happened to her. The problem is they get too close and A is pulling certain strings and sets out breadcrumbs for our PLL's to follow, and they follow like good little ducks, and falling into A's trap.

This season is a lot darker than the first one, and that's what I love about it. My favorite episode is the second to last. Honestly, it gave me the creeps, and that's not easy to do. Wait to you hear the line, ""Follow me and end  up like me.""

This show has a lot of plot twits and turns that you can't help get addicted too.  It's just so much fun seeing A do certain things, and we can sit back and enjoy what happens.

If you've read the books, or have seen season 1, then you know what to expect, and you won't be disAppointed.  I know I wasn't.  You can purchase this on June 5th, the same day as Season 3 starts, and when the next book in the series, Stunning, comes out.

This is A's world, and we just live in it.",1334880000,2,1845,4.0523415977961434

This show has been one of the greatest tv shows that i have seen in the longest time and i have been watching it since episode 1. I don't think many people would be disappointed in the show if they actually sit down and watch it from season one. It is a show that fills all my need, scary, funny, intense, mind-blowing, confusing and makes me think all the time. And they don't just leave leave you with a cliffhanger leave leave you with a Mount Everest hanger. this is the greatest show i can not express my love for it enough and i think everyone should give it a huge chance cause it will definantly not let you down.",1332115200,15,853,4.11377245508982
