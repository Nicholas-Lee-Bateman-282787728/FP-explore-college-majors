8058622,5,B0009A403E,"This is a Romantic comedy that centers around a theme that is usually un-touched by RC movies:  what if your wife turns out to be a lesbian?  What's worse, what if the husband (played by Scott Cohen) is a bona-fide good guy who didn't ask to be a part of this mess?  Well, things tend to get tied into knots.

John Stamos plays a womanizer (Cal) who would be the idol of most of we men.  This is the first time I've seen Stamos in a movie in a long time - thought he looked familiar, but could not quite place him.  Anyway, Paulina Porizkova is Lily, who is kind of Cal's counterpart;  a womanizing / manizing bi-sexual femme-fatale.  She has  a knack for wreaking havoc on all the lives she touches.

Michael Leydon Campbell stars as Jake;  a character I could relate to the most in this movie.  He's your typical good natured nice guy who lacks social skills and is therefore condemned to always come in last.  There is a deleted scene (in special features) that I think they should have kept in the movie.  It epitomizes his frustrations with women.  On the upside, he does get to hang out with Emily (Tara Reid).  Most nice guys never score that high on the hotness scale!

This is an RC movie that is sexy, funny and brutally honest.  Those who are looking for an unrealistic movie with a fairy tale ending would be best to skip this one.  SERENDIPITY it's not.",1140393600,8,1366,4.349206349206349
8058623,4,B0009A403E,"Knots? weird name! Strange story! Haven't heard of this movie? Neither had I. It wasn't bad though.

Knots is a story about three friends, Dave, (Scott Cohen) Jake, (Michael Leydon Campbell) Cal (John Stamos) and their wives girlfriends and loves.

Dave and Greta's (Annabeth Gish) marriage has devolved into the status of ho-hum. It's nothing they talk about. They may have not even consciously thought it out. Ultimately they agree to move into a new apartment, subconsciously believing it might give their floundering marriage a fixx.

Jake is the guy chicks really like, but unfortunately only to be friends with. Meanwhile friend Cal or someone else is getting further with the girls behind Jakes back. Cal on the other hand has a girlfriend, Emily, (Tara Reid) who travels extensively and when she's away, Cal loves to play and being a fashion photographer doesn't hurt.

Jake is confronting Cal about his latest transgression on their friendship in their local singles bar as Dave amusingly watches from the sideline, when a gorgeous creature catches his eye. This is Lily, (Paulina Porizkova) a mischievous, imp like barrister, who moves right in on Dave as Cal and Jake wander off, still arguing. Lily is putting the serious moves on Dave when Jakes returns. Dave, who is flattered and attracted to this comely vixen, is also repelled by this attraction and attempts to pawn Lily off on Jake, who asks Lily out. Lily demurs, that is, until Dave blurts out that he could come along also. Lily accepts and when Jake inquires about Dave's wife, he quickly includes Greta in the now, double date. Later, at dinner, when Greta seems to object that Dave was out with ""the boys"", Lily suggests a ""girls night out."" This is where the fun begins.

Conclusion

Paulina Porizkova playing Lily, is the wildcard in this movie. It's almost like she was injected by some divine plan into these people's lives to shake thing up and shake things up she did. Dave unexpectedly comes home for lunch one day and finds Greta in bed, naked with the equally naked Lily.

This experience leads Greta to demand a divorce. While the divorce is proceeding, Dave runs by the apartment to pick up some things and runs into Greta. Surprisingly, this leads both of them to experience the best sex of their marriage, after which Greta declares she is a lesbian. The thoroughly confused Dave now heads to Lily's office to confront her, whereupon she turns the tables and seduces Dave right on her desk. There's more but I've said enough.

Knots has a plotline not unlike the movie Closer but presented in a light almost wholesome manner compared to that film. Overall, I though the movie was good but not great. The same could be said for the cast, acting, story etc. While it may not be essential that you view this film, If you enjoy sexy comedies, this is a movie you should see.",1139443200,8,3409,4.873905429071804
8058624,4,B0009A403E,"I enjoyed this movie mostly. It was a fun look at how messed up relationships can get, and the boundaries that are often pushed. The cast is what makes the movie enjoyable, with notable performances from John Stamos, Tara Reid, Anabelle Gish, Scott Cohen, Paulina Porizkova, and Michael Leydon Campbell. Greta (Gish) is married to Dave (Cohen), and both of them end up having sex with  their mutual friend Lily (Porizkova). This sends their circle of friends into a dizzy, changing the dynamics of their relationships. It was a funny romantic comedy I found it refreshing.",1124582400,2,572,4.958333333333333
8058625,5,B0009A403E,"I didn't know what to expect coming into this film, and was VERY pleasantly surprised.  Far and away the best part of it is Paulina Pouriskova.  She has come a long way from being an SI swimsuit model and is very funny and polished and turns out to be a great actress.  John Stamos gives a great turn as well in a much more sophisticated character than he is usually allowed to play.  I don't normally think too much of Tara Reid, but she was great, and Annabeth Gish, who is always good, was amazing as the leading lady.",1118620800,8,521,4.232323232323233
