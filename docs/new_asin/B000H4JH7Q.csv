There is 1 movie that is not in widescreen, but I don't really care about this. Quality of these movies on DVD is fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Stephen King fan.",1211068800,3,320,4.262295081967213
2626172,3,B000H4JH7Q,there are only a few flaws with this boxset 1st not all the films are widescreen 2nd its a cheap boxset by that i mean the dvd boxes are the slim boxes like the friday the 13th collection i might take a pic of it and post it so you know what i mean. i hope this help you!,1159228800,5,271,3.610169491525424

2626205,1,B000H4JH7Q,A movie not worth watching and of no redeeming social value.  Perhaps Nicholson's worst movie.  Shame on Nicolson for having his name in this.,1454371200,,142,4.875

2626208,2,B000H4JH7Q,"The only thing good about this product is the price. But as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. I only bought this set for The Shining, but really do like the other two movies. What was so disappointing is that the only one in 16:9 format is The Shawshank Redemption and the other two are in cruddy 4:3 format. The box for The Shining says ""This feature is presented in the full aspect ratio of the original camera negative as Stanley Kubrick intended"". Well that isn't quite true. After doing a little research I found that it was shot in 4:3 but that the theatrical projection ""mattes off the top and bottom to make it appear as an 1.85:1 projection. This is how the movie is presented in HD on TV. Why didn't the manufacturer just matte the film to 1.85:1 before putting it on the DVD? Sure, I can zoom in with my TV, but the original resolution is lost on unnecessary content that's no longer seen.

With Dreamcatcher, it says ""This film has been formatted to fit your screen"". Well, that's not MY screen and I doubt if there are very many 4:3 TVs out there anymore.

As I said, the only good news is this set didn't cost much and is still watchable, although not nearly as enjoyable as if they were all in 1.85:1 format.",1447459200,,1232,4.306034482758621

2626236,3,B000H4JH7Q,"This collection of three Stephen King films only had 2 good movies in it: The Shining and Shawshank Redemption. The addition of  Dreamcatcher was like paying for a box of air. I guess the powers that be felt that only two good movies are worth the price. In that case, they should have just offered two movies.

2626299,5,B000H4JH7Q,"It's an excellent package.  The discs are of good quality, play with no problems.  But I recommend you read the books which of course are almost always better than the movie, especially The Shining.  The Shining drifts slightly away from the original story. You might be interested to note that the movie was shot at the apparent haunted hotel where he wrote the novel which has been featured in a couple of popular ghost hunting shows.  And Shawshank Redemption was shot at a prison that has also been featured in many television ghost hunting shows....but I didn't notice any ghosts in the movie... :)",1379203200,,603,4.769230769230769
2626300,5,B000H4JH7Q,The disk and case were in very good condition. I'm a very big Stephen King fan so its great to add it to my collection.,1377734400,,119,3.8
2626301,2,B000H4JH7Q,"This 3-film collection contains two of Stephen King's best films: The Shining and Shawshank Redemption. The Shining stars Jack Nicholson and is directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick. Shawshank Redemption is possibly King's best film. The other movie included is Dreamcatcher starring Morgan Freeman and it's the lesser of this lot. There is some bonus material provided but Shawshank Redemption doesn't get any extras. This collection could have been so much better with a documentary or commentary about the films from King himself. It's a value-pack so it isn't overflowing with bonuses. Despite it's limitations, the Thriller DVD Collection still remains the best set of SK films available. I would rate the three films 4 stars and this collection gets 2 stars for being skimpy. You may consider buying the movies separately on Blu-ray depending on your needs. There is no equivalent King BD collection right now. The Green Mile (not included) is another film worth watching.

The Stephen King DVD Collection (Pet Sematary Special Collector's Edition, The Dead Zone Special Collector's Edition, Graveyard Shift and Silver Bullet) is another SK DVD set but it isn't quite as good as the Thriller Collection. The Dead Zone is easily the best in that set. Directed by the legendary David Cronenberg and starring Christopher Walken, it shows a man struggling to deal with his psychic powers. Pet Sematary is good and scared many people in theaters. Graveyard Shift (1990) is about rats and basement secrets but it is forgettable. Silver Bullet stars the crazy Gary Busey in a bland tale about werewolves.",1377388800,,1607,5.180769230769231

2626335,5,B000H4JH7Q,I enjoyed all three of these movies years ago and it was nice to see them again.  What a bargain to find them all in this nice DVD set.,1353888000,,135,3.6551724137931036
2626336,4,B000H4JH7Q,"I picked up this packet of three ""Stephen King Thriller Collection"" movies off a DVD bargain rack for under ten dollars. I'd consider it a good deal. The packet is nicely done. Each of the three movies comes in it's own slim container attractively packaged. All of the movies are well done with excellent photography and good quality sound. These are not cheap B movies, they're first rate. All are well acted. The differences, and the ratings would be mostly in the content of each movie.

I watched the ""Shawshank Redemption"" first. It's just a first-rate movie having to do with prison life and I'm surprised it didn't get the best movie of the year award. It's well done in every way and I would find it hard to give anything less than five stars. ""The Shining,"" on the other hand, is a very well done movie but the story is loaded with creepy nonsense and I just have no taste for it. Although highly rated by reviewers, I could just see no better than three stars for this kind of drivel. ""Dreamcatcher"" has to do with an alien invasion of New England and the effort to stop it. I could only regard the movie as unmitigated nonsense, but it's rather well done nonsense and some people might enjoy it. I will save ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and watch it again in the future. The other two will be trades or thrift shop donations.

As a packet of movies, the thriller Collection is fairly good, but I have little use for the stories in two of the three movies. It would get a three plus rating by me, but I'll round it up to four because of the very high quality ""Shawshank Redemption.

2626337,5,B000H4JH7Q,I think these three movies a very good. I always liked Stephen King movies there is not a whole lot I can say that other reviews have not already said will watch again great price well worth the money.,1325808000,7,201,4.17948717948718

2626342,5,B000H4JH7Q,This is a very good deal for the price.  I'm really happy as it would have cost me much more to purchase these movies individually.,1235433600,10,131,4.24
2626343,3,B000H4JH7Q,"First, my reviews for all 3 films.
The Shining is a preety good, but overrated film from Stanley Kubrick. Its entertaining and you ask yourself at times what is going to happen next, but I didn't think it was scary at all. I give it 3 1/2 stars.
The Shawshank Redemption is a really good, but overrated movie. I think everybody will like the movie, its great, but not one of the top ten best movies ever made, as almost everyone says. I give it 4 stars.
Dreamcatcher is a really stupid, silly, and mediocre film, but kind of a guilty pleasure. I give it 2 1/2 stars.
Now to the release.
The version of The Shining is really good with a documentary that is about thirty  minutes long. However, its not the best version. The best version is the 2 disc special edition. 3 1/2 stars for the release.
The Shawshank Redemption has no special features. 0 stars.
Dreamcatcher has plenty of featurettes. 3 1/2 stars.
Overall, I can't really recommend this box set. You should get the 2 disc special editions of Shawshank and Shining, and just rent or skip Dreamcatcher.",1232323200,,1060,4.492227979274611
