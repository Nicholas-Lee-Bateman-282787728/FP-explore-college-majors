1490790,5,B00005JMJ4,"I believe, as opposed to my family, that this is a true classic of filmmaking.  With great acting, great cinematography and a smoothe, touching story, ""Lost In Translation"" proves itself to be one of the best films of the year so far.
The story is as follows: Two married people who find that marriage can be tough come together, confused and lost in Japan, not enjoying themselves very much.  But as they meet, they gain a wonderful friendship.  And went it starts to have the potential to carry too far, they both must decide if they should stay faithful or have an affair.
Bill Murrey has an Oscar potential role in this film.  He is continuously sad, but maintains a subtle happiness that lights up the screen at times.  It takes a great actor to balance that out.  Scarlett Johannsen, suprisingly, takes on a similar role with a great force that really amazes you.  They both make you sad, happy and inbetween at the same time.
The cinematography, at times, was outstanding.  There were certain affects that the camera achieved that really made you feel different emotions and see different things about the landscape and the person.  It is quite interesting.
Now, here are the disclaimers.  It does movie relatively slow, but jokes keep it interesting.  It is a romantic comedy.  But don't be too discouraged if you don't like them.  It is a different type.  It also doesn't really have much of a climax.  It has a subtle exciting end, but no action or anything of that sort.  But those are the only issues.  Otherwise, I recommend it to you, the reader of this review.
Bottom Line: This is probably one of the best films of the century in an allround way spanning acting, directing, writing and pure enjoyment. (I give it an A+)",1064016000,8,1735,4.636065573770492
1490791,5,B00005JMJ4,"I just came back from seeing ""Lost in Translation"". I was simply astounded by how well screenwriter/director Sophia Coppola was able to make a film that was both funny and poignant at the same time. The characters were deftly well-written. There were moments during the film when I thought the character of Bob Harris was strictly written for the constantly funny Bill Murray. For example, the brief scene where Bob goes golfing made me think of Bill in the hilarious ""Caddyshack"". And when Bob and Charlotte went to a karaoke bar with a bunch of friends of Charlotte's, I immediately thought of Bill doing his lounge act on SNL and singing the theme song to ""Star Wars"". Ironic? I didn't think so but if it was, it was unintentional and made the movie all the more special to me since I grew up on ""Caddyshack"" and ""Saturday Night Live"". I found the storyline of two strangers in a completely foreign country and somehow connecting with each other quite interesting. The writing in the film was compelling, and the score even more compelling. The music gave the film more depth and emotion. I thought that would have been too bloody predictable. Bill Murray was simply hilarious in this film. I loved it when he had an encounter with a hooker in the beginning in the movie and when he was on the stairmaster. Pure physical comedy at its finest. Bill's relationship with his wife is obvious based on the phone conversations he has with her. I love the sarcastic tone he uses in one of their conversations. Another great move on Sophia Coppola's part was having Scarlett Johansson play the disenchanted Charlotte. Although his role in the film is a bit brief, I enjoyed Giovanni Ribsi's role as the spouse who neglects Charlotte for his career as a rock and roll photographer. If there was one flaw in the film, I would have to say that it would be when Bob & Charlotte are chased out of a Japanese nightclub with a friend of Charlotte's. They were chased by someone who was shooting something that appeared to be pellets or bbs. I don't know but I found that scene completely unnecessary. Other than that scene, I loved ""Lost in Translation"". I truly got to see Bill shine as an actor in this film, both as a comedian as well as a drmatic actor. Scarlett Johanson also put in a wonderful performance in the film. Kudos to Sophia Coppola for the excellent writing and directing she contributed. Truly a wonderful movie.",1064016000,9,2418,4.638694638694639
1490792,5,B00005JMJ4,"First, let me say ""Bravo Sophia Coppola!""  She did a wonderful job with both the script and directing.  Second, I think Brian Acord deserves an oscar for the cinematography.  This film is visually stunning.  Third, both Murray and Johansson give fantastic performances.  They manage to be very funny, compassionate, human, and supremely interesting in their roles.  Finally, this film gives such a compelling look at Japan, it inspired me to book a vacation to Tokyo.
If you are looking to be entertained, amused, informed, touched, and inspired...then watch ""Lost in Translation.""",1063929600,6,581,5.329670329670329
1490793,4,B00005JMJ4,"One of the best and most interesting things about Sofia Coppolas's ""Lost in Translation"" is the unmistakable sense that we are viewing well and profoundly observed lives. Rather than block out all the peripheral noises and background talk, Coppola brings these things to the forefront on many occasions thereby adding the details of ongoing life to her story. In fact, ""Lost in Translation"" is all about the details: all the junk both petty and important that makes up a life that has nothing to do with the big stuff like Love, Hate, Birth and Death. It's the man in the Tokyo Hyatt talking about the Yankees, the way the girl is looking at her boyfriend in a Pachinko lounge or Charlotte quietly and reverently observing a Japanese wedding ceremony and how the groom takes the hand of his bride so as to help her up a flight of stairs. Coppola's camera and microphones linger over these things so lovingly and without any judgment that many times, even when Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and Bob (Bill Murray) are on camera, they take over...become more important.
The story of Charlotte and Bob is very prim and almost Victorian in its quaint propriety. It's also the story of two lost souls, both unhappy in their current relationships, who take the time to get to know each other, to become friends. Bill Murray need only raise an eyebrow to elicit laughs from an audience but here he takes the time and energy to actually give a performance not based on shtick.
""Lost in Translation"" is a simple story of two lost people who find a kind of happiness and acceptance with each other. When they part, there are no promises made, no plans to meet again. When they part it is seemingly forever and when Bob whispers something in Charlotte's ear, loud enough for us to know he has said something yet too quiet and private for us to comprehend, we think maybe, just maybe.",1063929600,6,1872,4.675757575757576
1490794,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola's tale of friendship and loneliness is a near pitch-perfect film and the best I've seen so far this year.  It's also Bill Murray's best performance.  He is nothing short of amazing playing a has-been actor with whom the Japanese are still infatuated.
The story takes place over a week period in Tokyo as we are introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte, played with much maturity by Scarlet Johannson.  They are both stuck in a culture they don't understand and marriages they aren't sure are working anymore.  Charlotte's husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer who is always on a shot and leaves her in the hotel to fend for herself.
She wanders around Tokyo and Bob keeps himself in the hotel bar where Charlotte finally bumps into him and a friendship is slowly developed.  This friendship saves them from the aching loneliness visually displayed by Sofia in long, beautiful shots of Johannson sitting in the hotel window looking out over the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo and Murray trying to find anything on Japanese television he can connect with.
Don't get me wrong.  This is not a downer movie.  It is one of such various and vast emotions that I'm surprised Sofia fits them in to one little movie.  There are moments of great laughter and joviality such as the ""gift"" that is sent to Bob's room.  But even when when Charlotte and Bob's adventure begins it is quite apparent they are still not truly happy especially when they end up at a Karaoke bar and you get to see Murray's character singing Roxy Music's heart-breaking ""More Than This"".
Some people may find the slight fun poking at the Japanese a little too much, but it's meant to show just how different their culture and ours are so different.  A few scene are down right gut-busting and others just drive the character's actions as they try to something to hold on to they can identify with.  It's an amazing cornucopia of events and emotions.
I found out, too, that Sofia went to Tokyo many times with her father, Francis Ford Coppola (you may have heard of him), and I wonder if they story is somewhat autobiographical.  Did she met a has-been actor when she was left behind in the hotel room as her father went off to do some film work?  Either way, Sofia has made a small masterpiece that proves that she did indeed get the filmmaker gene.",1063584000,34,2343,4.671532846715328
1490795,5,B00005JMJ4,"There can be nothing as alienating as finding yourself alone in a foreign country while not knowing the language and local customs. LOST IN TRANSLATION follows two individuals who find themselves in this exact predicament. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) travels to Tokyo to do a promotion for a brand of whiskey. Staying in the same hotel is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young woman who is accompanying her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) on a business trip. Before meeting, both Bob and Scarlett are alienated in the foreign Japanese culture but after befriending each other they create a unique friendship based on their circumstances that enable them to survive their stay in Tokyo.
In this film Bill Murray proves once again that he has the ability to be a brilliant actor. While he is funny, he never allows his comedy to take over the scene. Scarlett Johansson also does a fine job in portraying her character and is a convincing actress.
The bright neon lights of Tokyo come alive in MATCHSTICK MEN. And so does this marvelous tale of human connection between these two individuals. Surely this is one of the best films of 2003.",1063584000,3,1141,4.917098445595855
1490796,5,B00005JMJ4,"I'm still speechless from this film, so I won't begin to attempt to put into words the emotion and awe that it will inspire in all but the coldest of hearts.  A very moving experience and the totally unique and original depiction of a relationship that is elevetated high above the mundane into something spritual. But there is so much more here. To describe this movie as merely a great film is to call the Mona Lisa a pretty good painting.  This is not a mere film, this is a jewel, a treasure, and words can't begin to describe it so I will stop trying - One must just see it.  It will speak for itself.",1063584000,4,606,4.206896551724138
1490797,5,B00005JMJ4,"My sister and I saw ""Lost in Translation"" this weekend, in a packed theatre.  From the applause that followed, I'd guess that we weren't the only ones who were blown away.  It was the first movie in a long time that really felt worth my time and energy, where I never wondered why I was there or had my attention wander.  Its not a book, its not a rehash of something else, its not trilogy.  Its just a very real piece of life, which is sometimes hard, and often exhausting.  People make good choices, and bad choices & in between choices.  And our paths cross, and it changes our lives a little bit.  I thought both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsen were well cast, and they didn't over play it a bit.  The movie never took the easy way out.  It just touched something in me.  I hope you enjoy it.",1063497600,6,799,4.231788079470198
1490798,5,B00005JMJ4,"I just got back from seeing ""Lost in Translation""...  Now THAT was a ... good movie!
Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are two Americans who find themselves ""trapped"" in Tokyo. Well, okay, they're not really trapped, but they both feel that way...
Bill Murray is an actor, in Tokyo to do a commercial, while Scarlett has followed her husband there on a prolonged business trip.  Both are ""strangers in a strange land""... wandering the corridors of the hotel late at night, hanging out in the hotel bar, basically trying to figure out what the hell they're doing there...
Is it a romance? Well, sort of... but sort of not. Both characters are married, and not to each other, and so that's a rather serious obstacle to a romance... and yet...
If you enjoy ""serious"" movies (as opposed to Hollywood big-budget thingies) and if you're the kind of person who enjoys discovering a foreign culture, there's an awful lot to enjoy in this film...",1063411200,8,938,4.748466257668712

But not lost like they don't know where they are, lost as in they don't exactly know where they are going in their lives and why they have chosen the paths that they are on. It's a beautiful movie that feels like a blanket to me, so comforting to watch and makes me feel good. If this movie doesn't touch your heart, then you are not human. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson both give amazing performances. Not only is the acting and the story fantastic, but the images and scenery as well as the soundtrack are perfect and so fitting for this film. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.

They're feeling neglected and misunderstood by their partners, but not using it as an excuse for a dalliance. Lonely in an unfamiliar city and lacking any viable knowledge of the language and less than savvy on culture, they're lost.  Checking each other out from a distance at first, they hook up (in the old sense) and begin to explore together.  Each gets the other's wit and both share a healthy capacity for pleasure and fun.  This is an incredibly tender, funny, and intimate film. It's wonderfully polished, but maintains a very natural flow and pace. Gets you where you live.

Depressed because you're bored in life, where you're married to someone who lives a simple boring life, where you always associate with people that lives boring uninteresting lives leaving you wanting more in life so you're ""lost in translation"" not knowing what to do with your life.  So, you're left lingering around tokyo city hanging around japanese jazz clubs and japanese restaurants

But, this is the kind of film that depresses you because it leaves you wanting to see more of their stuck lives, what do they do with their lives, where do they go, how do they end up?  As if the film is missing an ending that should've been longer.  This was a unique film because it used the same professional style of filming we had not yet seen, before youtube even existed, where it showed how people's lives are in real life in the film of a part docu-movie, part photography project.

I found it very interesting that this movie has nearly as many 1-star reviews as it has 5-star reviews. After reading the negative reviews, I'd say that anyone watching this movie for the first time has to have a wide threshold for storytelling and pacing.

For anyone who dislikes the lack plot, rest assured that there is one, but it's the opposite of adrenaline-inducing. You definitely get more enjoyment out of it if you find yourself questioning why certain angles, moments, glances, lines, etc. are present. For example, there's a very brief scene where Charlotte is alone in her room, looking at old photos of her and her husband, and showing for the first time that he's more interested in looking at the camera than looking at her. Immediately after, there's a scene of Bob practicing putting in his room, celebrating because he finally hit the ball in. At that moment, it's fun to ask why the director included that cut, and how it contributes to the movie as whole.

There are moments of small and awkward comedy, and an little message for those feeling a little lost in the various stages of life. If you're looking for a movie that makes you think, this is a good one for you.",1484524800,4,1418,4.552941176470588

1491243,1,B00005JMJ4,"No ways around it - this was a terrible movie. It was a meandering, pointless movie aimed at pretentious people, allowing them to say there's a deeper meaning and others ""just don't get it."" There's nothing to get. It's two wealthy white people awkwardly complaining about how there's nothing to their lives.

There's no drama. There's no action. No love. No normal story progress (conflict, resolution, etc.). It doesn't go anywhere. None of the characters are remotely interesting or even likeable. You hate Murray and Johansson's characters and you want them to suffer in meaningful ways. Still, you're hoping that the hot young girl will cheat on her husband and sleep with the creepy old dirtball because AT LEAST IT WOULD PROVIDE SOME SORT OF PLOT. You know the movie is trash when you're hoping for infidelity to save it. But that doesn't even come. The young girl and the old creepy guy just sit around and continue to complain about nothing.

Basically, if you like Seinfeld, but found the humor, irony, and interesting, likeable characters to be cumbersome, this movie might be for you. Just awkward and rambling conversation about nothing that never leads to any changes.",1481846400,2,1182,4.9646464646464645

I liked parts of it even then but it seemed unnecessarily slow and almost obtuse.  Fast forward to the present and I can totally relate.  The movie is about two drifters--two huckleberry friends who finding themselves at sea in a culture they can't understand, cling to one another despite a thirty year age difference.  They get each other. Bill Murray plays an aging actor, Bob Harris, sent to Tokyo to make a whiskey commercial.  Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte,  a young wife whose husband is an up- and- coming photographer.  Neither character is comfortable where life has taken them.  Bob is in the horse latitudes of his marriage and on the downhill run of this career, Charlotte has no idea what she wants to be in life.  The film is funny at turns, touching at times, and always authentic.

1491370,1,B00005JMJ4,"The movie has an opening shot of Scarlett Johanssen's buttocks-which proves to be prophetic.

With Bill Murray, I was expecting this to be a comedy. But it is not-unless you count the scenes of Japanese people acting like crude stereotypes.

Bill Murray plays a washed-up actor who goes to Japan to do a Japanese whiskey commercial, staying in an expensive hotel in the process. Scarlett plays the wife of a workaholic, also staying at the hotel while her husband is involved in his job, leaving her alone. Basically it's a pastiche of scenes of everyone talking, or lying around in their hotel rooms, or interacting with Japanese stereotypes, until the two meet in a bar. But then I stopped the movie-too many long,boring scenes of nothing happening. And from the negative comments here, I realized that there was no reward if I had watched to the end.

My review title means, in Japanese, ""This movie is boring."" I wonder if any Japanese saw it, and if any of them liked it.",1472256000,,976,4.695906432748538
1491447,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is a film I have historically gone back and forth on. It tends to be a film that people either love or hate, and while I've always liked it a lot, Ive also had a handful of sticking points that have prevented me from loving it. For much of my life, Ive regarded it as a strong film thats a little too simple in its plotting and too American Beauty-ish in its pretentious to be anything like a masterpiece.

Of course, many in the cinephile community would disagree with that assessment. At the end of the last decade, for example, Metacritic compiled critics lists of the best films from 2000 to 2009, and Lost in Translation was ranked as the 17th best film of the decadewhich seemed hyperbolic, but not absurd. After all, the film was ranked above masterpieces like Sideways and Y Tu Mam Tambin, and was ranked below decidedly superior films like Far From Heaven, Pans Labyrinth, and Brokeback Mountain.

Now, after watching it for the fifth or sixth time, I realize that Lost in Translation is both a deeply flawed film and a masterpiece. The biggest problem Ive always had with the film is that it presents a very Eurocentric view of Japan; theres a reverence here for the country of Japan, sure, but theres also a very insensitive feel in places, particularly in a dreadful scene early in the film where Bill Murrays character is greeted at his door by a Japanese woman (simply credited as Premium Fantasy woman) and the following exchange occurs:

Premium Fantasy woman: Mr. Kazu sent me, premium fantasy. My stockings. Rip them. (sounds like ""lip them)

Premium Fantasy woman: Rip my stockings. Yes, please, rip them.

Bob: What?

Premium Fantasy woman: Rip them. HEY! Rip my stocking!

Bob: Hey? Lip them? Lip them? What?

At the end of the scene (after he has, in fact, tried to rip her stockings), she gyrates around on the floor and says, Let me go, prease!

You see, in Japanese, theres no real equivalent of English R and L sounds, so people who are native Japanese speakers sometimes have difficulty with pronouncing English words like rip. Theres no real reason to focus on this, though if you're going to focus on it, you might as well focus on it with with empathy and cultural sensitivity; Sofia Coppola, on the other hand, decides to use it as comedic fodderwhich may be less egregious if it were even slightly funny.

Theres plenty of similarly uncomfortable moments sprinkled around the film (like the boyfriend of Scarlett Johanssons character mocking the native Japanese photographers pronunciation of rock and roll as lock and loll), as well as some visual gags meant to highlight the disparity between Bill Murrays height (62) and the average height of the local citizens. (A scene with a shower head that is far too low for Bill Murray is played for laughs, as is a scene where he towers over everyone on an elevator.)

These moments have always stuck out like a sore thumb for me, and apparently Im not alone. In a piece for The Guardian, Japanese-American musician Kiku Day wrote that, Lost in Translation is being promoted as a romantic comedy, but there is only one type of humour in the film that I could see: anti-Japanese racism, before going on to say that, There is no scene where the Japanese are afforded a shred of dignity, and that, It is similar to the way white-dominated Hollywood used to depict African-Americans: as crooks, pimps, or lacking self control compared with white Americans.

I don't agree with all of her criticisms, although she does tap into some of this films problemsnot to mention the fact that the connection made between Bob and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray) is based in part on their lack of interest in socializing with the native population. Throughout the film, Coppola relies on presenting Japanese people as different and strange; Bob and Charlottes interactions with Japanese populations only seems to fuel their loneliness and sense of alienation.

To be clear, Im not arguing that Coppola had bad intent or ill will in her depiction of Japanese culture; Im simply saying that while this is a great film, its also a great film that was made from a place of tremendousand problematicprivilege. Lost in Translation has arguably the finest opening shot since The Searchers, but like John Fords masterpiece, it also has some really ugly racial overtones.

This is a recurring problem in many of Sofia Coppolas films (most noticeable in Somewhere and The Bling Ring): at her worst, she fetishizes spoiled, bored, wealthy, narcissistic white Americans. It comes off as insulated, disconnected, and nave to the day-to-day stresses that average, everyday people go through. Bob and Charlotte may be having existential crises, sure, but being able to just chill in Japan for a little while probably sounds pretty amazing to everyone else.

And yet, despite my quibbles with some of the scenes (and my general indifference to the rest of Sofia Coppolas filmography), there really is something special at the core of Lost in Translation: a snapshot of two lonely people learning how to connect with another human being. Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murrays characters form a very believable and genuine connection, and the two actors have amazing and legitimate chemistry together, with Murray playing a thinly veiled version of himself, and Johanssonwho was only 17 when the movie was filmedplaying a perplexed college graduate with ease.

Some of the best scenes in the film are centered on Bobs strained relationship with his wife. Scenes involving passive-aggressive faxes arriving in the middle of the night work wonderfully, as does an amazing scene where he tells her over the phone that he wants to eat healthier (like Japanese food) and she replies, Why don't you just stay there, so you can have it every day? Coppolas screenplay captures a strained relationship with tremendous honesty and insight, better than just about any other film Ive ever seen.

She also captures the ironic sense of alienation that big cities can evoke, nearly as well as Scorsese did in Taxi Driver; a scene where Scarlett Johanssons character sits on her hotels window ledge and gazes out at Tokyo is just amazing. Throughout the film, Coppola also uses music very wisely and effectively; the usage of Sometimes by My Bloody Valentine as Charlotte and Bobs taxi passes key landmarks in Tokyo is just spectacular, as is the usage of The Jesus and Mary Chains Just Like Honey in one of the boldest and most brilliant endings Ive ever seen.

One of the best scenes in the film takes place towards the end, when Bob and Charlotte lay next to each other on a hotel bed. In an uninterrupted long take that lasts for about two full minutes, the two of them discuss aging, marriage, having kids, and trying to figure out who you are and what direction your life should go in. Charlotte tells Bob that she tried to be a writer and photographer but was unhappy with her work, and the way Bob reassures and encourages her feels very real and genuine.

The next time you watch this scene, pay particular attention to the way that Coppola uses a long take to not only highlight the great chemistry between the actors, but also to demonstrate the way the actors express their characters visually; the scene starts with Charlotte having her hands clenched together and Bob with his hands to the side, and as it progresses, Bob becomes even more relaxed (placing one of his hands behind his head), though Charlotte remains just as closed off. The impression given is not thats shes uncomfortable in his company; its that she has yet to discover a way to be comfortable in her own skin.

This, of course, is all in the lead-up to one of the best endings youll ever see. Some find the finale to be lazily ambiguous and a cop-out; I find it to be thought-provoking and powerful. Some great films dip at the end (like Psycho), but the ending of Lost in Translation really seals the deal on what a unique and special film this is. Whatever you think of Lost in Translation, it really is like no other film youve ever seen; I suppose that there is a kind of Before Sunrise vibe at times, but Coppola is able to create such a distinct set of characters and circumstances that makes this film easy to admire, but hard to emulate.",1472083200,,8305,4.7782426778242675

This is possibly the worst cinematography I've ever seen (including Shorts, Indys and B-List).  For some reason, the cameraman couldn't hit a focus mark to save his life.  This film is riddled with out of focus shots and I'm not just talking pans and dollys... Static shots too.  How hard is it to nail focus on an actor who is standing still, seriously?  I would call out the scenes, but there are just too many of them.  Then there's the out of sync dialogue, folly that doesn't match up and some wild tracks don't fit the scene either.  Then there's my favorite film faux pa, the hotel room scene where the boom op is seen clearly reflected in the window.  But the list doesn't stop there, there's a bunch of continuity issues throughout as well and some location goofs, etc.  I can't believe that the DOP didn't shoot enough footage and this was all the editors had to work with.  If this was the best footage shot, very sad.  I actually tried to suffer though the terrible production/editing, but just couldn't make it through the entire movie (I tried on three occasions - continuing where I left off).

Now, the next part of my review is subjective, the first part is just plain fact.  I can let poor production slide if story is gripping and engaging.  I've watched plenty of B-List, Shorts and Indys that have been produced on minimal budgets, and have enjoyed them.  But this story was just slow and bland.  It's probably because the edits and scenes made little to no sense.  It's like I was watching a movie where 50 short films had been stitched together and called a feature.  Most of the movie is just filler shots of various locals in Japan, and had nothing to do with storytelling.

Having said this, it seems many people enjoy this movie.  Most people probably never even notice the out of sync dialogue, the terrible focus and bad edits.  It's kind of like the photographer who notices every mistake in their photo, while everyone else thinks it's a work of art.  And speaking of photography, in the scene where Bill Murray is being photographed, the assistant never loads the camera with film and the strobes fire about 1/4 of the time.  No company is going to drop $2mil on an adervertising campaign, then hire some yahoo who can't load the camera and who takes hours setting up strobes, umbrellas, etc... only to be stupid enough to continue taking photos when the strobes aren't firing.  Here again, if you enjoyed the film, you probably never noticed.",1461456000,3,2583,4.626373626373627

a guy getting older, a pretty young wife being ignored -- an interesting examination of the human condition.

No plot, poor dialogue, ugly characterization of japanese people (basically makes them into clowns).  I suspect that if the director's last name was not Coppola, it would have received a fraction of the acclaim that it did.  Wish I could give it zero stars.

The idea that it's overrated also bears out historically.  I've never seen a movie get so much critical acclaim and then basically vanish from our collective cinematic memory.  We're talking about a movie that got as much (or more) praise than Pulp Fiction--certainly the critics as a whole rated it higher.  Who references this movie now?",1458950400,2,730,4.869918699186992

1492521,4,B00005JMJ4,"This movie address many things...the sublimes within the movie itself is what I found the most interesting.  For instance, I found humor each time Bill was directed to do something in the photo sessions and the photographer's inability to translate what was needed to direct the model.  This language barrier and the intended meaning not being delivered was hilarious.
The movie also showed how people think they have something or belong to something or someone which can be changed by a fleeting moment or a chance meeting.  The affairs of the heart are not so easily controlled.
While watching I also saw how a person could be lonely while surrounded by millions of people...the natural need to belong or have something in common with another is always a challenge when abroad.
Last of all the movie displayed how we as humans develop relationships with different cultures.  This is part of the human condition.
The movie is a bit slow, you will have to find the level or levels of meaning within the movie.  This movie has the ability to deliver perspective and depth.
""All in one""...humor, love, relationships, friendships, and it shows just how easy it is to become derailed from a comfortable life into chaos.

Both of the main characters were dealing with tough times in their marriage.  How were they going to deal with the challenges? Move on and be together? Well, it ended with no conclusion. He just left but kissed her as if he loved her. What was the point of the movie. Why did he just decide to leave? Are they getting together again? I fell as if I dated someone for 6 months then she left me. No explanation. Also acting by Bill Murray was very similar to Groundhog Day. It was as if he just walked off one movie set and started the next. Same humor except he isn't self absorbed (as in Groundhog Day).",1458518400,3,712,4.235294117647059

1492619,4,B00005JMJ4,"I'm no polished film critic, so bear with me, but I did feel compelled to review this after my second viewing tonight. The first viewing was about 12 years ago shortly after it was first released. At that time, it was the talk of the town from critics, and perhaps as a result, I had expectations of some sort of grandeur that were not only not delivered upon, but, as I see now, weren't even intended. As a result, I was left confused, not sure what to think.

Also, the underlying current of marital infidelity rubbed me the wrong way, to be honest.

However, after seeing it tonight, I have a new appreciation for the film, and for first time viewers, I would urge them to consider the film in the following way: This isn't a plot-laden story. It's a painting, using celluloid. It is a tapestry of humanity. Sit back, and absorb without expectations.",1458345600,,853,4.496774193548387

Charlotte cheats on her husband who really does care for her, and Bill cheats on his wife (who didn't seem like a bad person to me) and together, they are two self-absorbed racists who just poke fun at the Japanese every chance they get. And they aren't smart either, considering neither of them even look for fun things to do in Japan, they just mope around every chance they get. And every scene was so stupid, including the tasteless strip club scene. (Or, according to Charlotte or Bill, they would call it a ""CARUB"", once again mocking the Japanese.) And also gotta love the scene where Bill is rude to the waitress when they go to eat at a restaurant, and Charlotte gets mad not because he cheated on his wife, but because he didn't cheat with her. Those two unlikable jerks deserve each other.

The shots of Japan are nice, but other than that, this movie sucks. I only finished it because I rented it. If you want a GOOD Sofia Coppola film...watch Marie Antoinette (2006). Thank god she redeemed herself from this crap.",1458259200,,1176,4.626794258373206

1493446,3,B00005JMJ4,"This is a review for the blu-ray version of the movie. To me, the movie itself deserves 5 stars.

The blu-ray is sub-par in quality. There's a lot of grain in most scenes, and you can tell they've done quite a poor job at upscaling the video. It's basically DVD quality upscaled to Blu-ray.

Such a wonderful movie, such a wonderful visit to Japan and the most lovely people of Japan. The movie is both funny and very touching at the same time. Go ahead - Lick my sock.  For Bill Murray, this movie may be a kind of revisit to Groundhog Day; for Scarlett - Under the Skin - because this movie highlights the country and people of Japan as does ""Under the Skin"" the people and glorious terrain of Scotland, plus the soundtrack and the score.

1493699,1,B00005JMJ4,"I saw this movie with Bill Murray in it and figured, hey, you can't go wrong with a Bill Murray movie.  So I bought it.  The premise of the movie seems to be the experiences of Murray's character in dealing with the language and cultural differences of an American in Japan. Mixed in with this is an unusual relationship with Scarlett Johansson who he seems to befriend well over half way through the movie.
Watching this movie was an 1hour and 41minutes of my life I will never get back.  I suffered through the entire thing hoping it would get better.  There doesn't seem to be any plot, nor any point to the movie, other than possibly showing off the lights and sites of Japan.  It seems to be a collection of random scenes that have no link and make very little sense.  It's rated R for sexual content, but don't expect Scarlett Johansson to be letting it all hang out. Half way through the movie Murray goes to a ""sex show bar"" with naked women, hence the rating.  The sex bar scene lasts about 2 minutes, and seems pointless.  Perhaps they wanted an R rating for the movie???
The climax of the movie was when the grandfatherly Murray passionately kisses the very young sexy Johansson, and then the movie ends.
I would not recommend this movie unless you are into pointless entertainment or just want to see the neon signs in Japan.",1453334400,9,1337,4.473251028806584

1493702,5,B00005JMJ4,"This cinematic gem is so subdued that you might have missed it the first time around. The hype around Murray's performance is completely warranted, his nuance and restraint are so controlled that you are drawn into the character without ever thinking ""hey, that's great acting."" Coppola's writing, directing, and soundtrack blend seamlessly and effortlessly. This movie never feels overwrought or pretentious IMHO though others may disagree. It's simply a beautiful love story rendered with care, intelligence, and subtle humor. A rare perfect film.",1450915200,10,549,5.626506024096385

1493863,4,B00005JMJ4,"The movie was filmed in the vertical high-rise megalopolis, Tokyo. Bill Murray arrived to a comity and decorous welcome from the Japanese who cordially rolled out the red-carpet, a first-class reception where everyone reached out to greet this celebrity actor, as he was known, from the U.S. He was paid $2 million for an advertisement endorsing a brand of whiskey. In a few scenes, he came across as not remembering his lines, to be extemporizing, or winging it on the fly, maybe as part of his act. Also, the scenes of the commercial ad photo shoot of him holding and sipping this acclaimed ale, ""make it Suntory time"" looked somewhat gauche because of the language barrier. A point was being made about the strain of jet lag, the toll of being away from home and family, and living out of a suitcase. He was having a really difficult time adjusting, you shouldn't laugh, but the fatuity was funny. Later, the moon, planets, and stars were aligned for the serendipitous meeting of Scarlett Johansson. Her husband, a photographer, was there on business. He worked long hours; he was often away for days at a time. Both main character's spouses had misguided priorities, taking their partner for granite (a hard igneous rock) by not making time for them, and leaving them to feel lonely and vulnerable. A platonic, non-gratuitous friendship developed between the avuncular Murray and affable Johansson because they had a lot in common to commiserate about and make their stay there less inure and more pleasant.",1441324800,,1511,4.90625
1493972,1,B00005JMJ4,"I just came back from a trip to Japan so I thought this movie might be fun. I did get to see places that I saw on my trip, but that was the highlight of this movie. The story line didn't take us anywhere. The acting, the directing were great.  It was really a ""slice of life"" piece of two characters. We get to know their background, but we don't get to really know them.

But what really cements this film are the exquisite and never overplayed performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson.  It's a movie about relationships but not in the usual formulaic sense.  The ending, for example, is going to be clear for some and ambiguous for others.  And while sexual imagery and themes appear throughout, the movie celebrates a different, and powerful bond  between the lead characters.  If you believe that love does not have to be physical, you will find much to enjoy here.",1439078400,,646,4.990654205607477

It's a funny, sentimental film with little excitement, but a wonderful plot.  Funny how Murray and Johansson both managed to find a way to sing, as they both fancy themselves as vocalists.

I can see why I might come off as a hippy child, writing a review about this indie film and how it touched my soul, and I'm not going to say that's not true.

1494376,5,B00005JMJ4,"This movie surprised me.  Very different tenor from what Bill Murray usually does.  If you are a Bill Murray fan, or rather, a fan of his particular type of movies (Ghostbusters, Groundhog's Day), don't expect to get the same humorous dose.  That being said, it is always nice to see a good actor take on a completely different role as Murray has done alongside a very young and very talented Scarlett Johansson.  They do a beautiful job of creating believable underlying sexual tension in a special relationship story that is more subtle and quietly emotional than episodic or obvious.  Having just moved to Japan myself, I found myself able to completely relate to the strangeness, even bizarreness their two characters experience as they slowly build up a unique friendship against the backdrop of Tokyo's famous locales and entertainments.  If you're in the mood for a thinker, for a subtle emotional experience, if you're a Murray and/or Johansson fan, or if you like Japan, I recommend you watch this movie.",1427760000,,1013,4.964497041420119

1494563,4,B00005JMJ4,"I first saw Sofia Coppola's 2003 love story Lost in Translation a few years ago and was distinctly underwhelmed. Seeing it again I now realize that while it has irredeemable flaws which definitely qualify the inflated critical praise this film has received, it is actually much better than I had thought. The narrative concerns two Americans stuck in a luxury Tokyo Hotel. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a semi-retired Hollywood actor in Tokyo for a week to shoot a whiskey commercial. Married for 25 years, he is in mid-life crisis. The geographical distance between himself and his family emphasizes the emotional chasm that exists between him and them. Suffering from terminal jet lag he parks himself for the week in the sprawling `New York bar' on the top floor of the hotel. Charlotte (a 17 year old Scarlett Johansson) has just graduated college and is in Japan with her workaholic photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) who is on a fashion shoot. Left alone most of the time she contemplates the sad state of her 2 year marriage and reflects on the fact that she doesn't really know what to do with her life. Also suffering from jet lag she meets Bob in the bar. Two insomniac kindred lost spirits connecting, the two tentatively embark on a relationship.

What plot there is centers on little incidents, little adventures Bob and Charlotte share. They eat sushi, visit a hospital to sort out a suspect toe, have a night on the town with Japanese friends which involves drinking, clubbing and karaokeing, and (in the film's most moving scene) watch a movie together on TV (La Dolce Vita of course) in her room and talk about life and marriage which is anything but sweet for either of them. ""Does it get better?"" asks the young Charlotte. ""No,"" is middle aged Bob's brutally honest first response before he launches into a moving equivocation. When I first saw this I was annoyed at what I saw as the empty vacuity of the film. Now I appreciate that this is an unfair assessment. While the film stays with the two characters, there is an aching vulnerability inside both which Murray and Johansson evoke with great success. Murray cashes in his slapstick inclinations for droll dead pan reactions which really carry the film. There are a couple of set-piece comic scenes where his wit sparkles - running through his repertoire of impersonations of famous people for a photo session and then wrestling with a manic exercise machine in the hotel gym which yabbers at him in Japanese as it escalates out of control. For the most part though he scores through dead-pan reactions off the actions of others, especially the old guy in the hospital waiting room who tries to talk to him in Japanese while a couple of old ladies sitting behind crack up.

Johansson is also excellent at conveying Charlotte's precocious wisdom (she's a philosophy graduate) which while clicking with Bob, clashes spectacularly with her husband and the immature actress Kelly (Anna Faris) who they meet in the hotel. Coppola's own Oscar-winning script is adapted to a series of semi-improvised dialogs and situations which delicately sketch out the perils of luxury hotel existence disconnected from one's cultural roots. The ennui is palpably caught here by the writer-director and her actors who clearly believe in their material and the love story is moving more for the potential of what `could' happen rather than actually what `does' happen. The sensibility is one on the whole much closer to European cinema than to American and it is cause for celebration that the film made a handsome profit in the States. Hopefully this heralds a decrease in the kind of sentimental push-button manipulative mush that passes for entertainment in most Hollywood love comedies these days.

Sad to relate despite my new appreciation of Coppola's handling of the central relationship, my biggest objection to this film remains and my recommendation must stay qualified. I am a long term resident in Japan and am fed up with the negative way the country is perceived in the Western media and in films such as this one. This view is essentially a polarization. On one hand we have the `good' old traditional Japan, the land of ancient temples, ikebana, Buddhist ceremonies, gardens, healthy food and Mt. Fuji. On the other hand we have the `bad' new Japan, the land of brash glaring neon lights, pachinko parlors, wacky game centers, karaoke dens, exotic titty bars, and OTT theme nightclubs. Unfortunately, Coppola captures too many clichs in this film which have been done to death elsewhere and purvey an image of the Japanese people as a wacky, way out, nerdy lot who are completely disconnected from their `good' cultural roots. Awful cringe-worthy scenes include a middle aged S/M hooker sent to entertain Bob in his room, a ridiculously camp TV show Bob has to appear on (most of which was mercifully cut as one of the deleted scenes shows) and a Star Wars fight exit from a club with people firing lazar lights of the kind I have never seen in this country. Charlotte takes the obligatory ride on the bullet train to Kyoto to cue up clichd pictures of `old' Japan while Bob gets the rough treatment from a dictatorial commercial director who thinks he's Akira Kurosawa and barks his orders at Bob in rude commands which are (yes) lost in translation. The main problem as I see it is that the Japanese themselves churn out films and TV programs that encourage this polarized perception of their country which they know not to be the truth. So for them this film isn't offensive and can be released with barely a head turned. Viewed by audiences overseas who don't know the reality of every day life in Japan (which believe me isn't that different from life in their own countries) and such a polarization is taken as a gospel truth. This film isn't anywhere near as bad as most foreign views of Japan (for example, Fred Schepsi's abysmal Tom Selleck vehicle Mr. Baseball) and where it stays with the central relationship it barely goes wrong, but the view of the country remains sadly myopic even if one can make the argument that it simply shows Japan as how it appears to two people newly arrived in the place.

The quality of this Momentum DVD release is excellent, the picture (16:9 / 1.85:1 widescreen letterbox) admirably displaying Lance Accord's excellent cinematography which animated the Japanese crew by using very little artificial light, even on outdoor scenes. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is crystal clear and showcases an excellently chosen playlist of 80s/90s pop songs. The final usage of The Jesus and Mary Chain's ""Just Like Honey"" resonates strongly in the mind after the film's moving conclusion. The disc comes with a feast of extras - a behind the scenes documentary, interviews with Coppola and Murray and deleted scenes. Probably if you are not familiar with Japan and are simply after a romantic comedy which is a bit different you will be won over by this film. Certainly fans of Coppola and the two lead actors should not hesitate...",1424649600,2,7038,4.8576186511240635

1494710,3,B00005JMJ4,"The film does have its strengths.  It sets the mood very well.  Being in the middle of a huge city with a completely different culture and language does accentuate the overriding theme of feeling alienated and lost in life in general.  The film is at its best when it explores that theme in both of the main characters.

What takes away from that though, is that even though the Murray character is going through this sort of existential crisis in which he is questioning everything and feeling awful every step of the way as he does so, he still manages to put all of that on hold to be extra cute and quirky every time he is around the Johansen character.  I'm sure some people will find the flirting funny or maybe even charming and playful.  I found it distracting and kind of awkward.  Realistically, I'm not sure that they have very much in the way of meaningful conversation aside from one brief dialogue about life and love.  You would think that they'd have so much to talk about.  Maybe it was better left unsaid?  Who knows.

Certainly not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but it could have very easily been better had they focused more on the characters and stayed true to where each of them was at in life instead of forcing them into an awkward romantic comedy.",1418774400,,1288,4.461538461538462

1494942,5,B00005JMJ4,"Much has been said about ""Lost in Translation.""  Some find it tedious and boring while others enjoy the movie by trying to figure out what it's really about.  I say enjoy it for what it is--two lonely souls far from home who find comfort in each other's company.

Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson) is young, married, and unsure of what she wants to do with her life.  She's in Tokyo with her husband, a photographer preoccupied with his clients.  He's not around much, and when he is he's emotionally detached, which only adds to Charlotte's loneliness. While on a long-distance telephone call to America, she wonders who it is she's married. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is middle-aged and a former movie star who still attracts attention wherever he goes.  He's in Tokyo to endorse a Japanese whiskey.  He loves his wife and kids, and may be having a midlife crisis.

Charlotte and Bob are staying in the same large impersonal hotel.  The bar on the umpteenth floor where they meet commands a glittering view of the city, and is the last place to look for a meaningful relationship.  But that is the result.  At first, all they have in common is they can't sleep.  After running into each other a few times, Charlotte invites Bob to join her for a night out with friends.  He accepts and their casual acquaintance evolves into something special.

Bob makes her laugh.  Whenever they meet she giggles, something she never does with her husband.  Is romance growing between them?  Judging by Bob's straight-arrow behavior, probably not, although Charlotte encourages him at a party when she winks at him and sings: ""I'm special, so special, I've got to have some of your attention, give it to me.""

In a key scene, Charlotte confesses she feels stuck.  A few moments later she adds, ""I'm mean.""  ""Mean's okay,"" Bob says. He adds, ""I'm not worried about you.""  ""Does it get any easier?"" she asks.  ""No,"" he says, then reverses himself.  ""Yes.  It gets easier.  The more you know who you are and what you want, the less you let things upset you.""  What Bob does is validate her feelings. He doesn't pass judgement or offer suggestions.  She's feeling lonely and insecure about who she is, and Bob tells her that's okay.  ""You'll figure it out,"" he reassures her.  Why doesn't he make a pass?  Because he sees a brain behind the pretty face.  He has no desire to sleep with her because it might actually mean something to her, and leave her in an even more vulnerable state.  In a way, ""Lost in Translation"" is an old fashion movie with old-fashion notions about men and women, and I find that refreshing.  Five stars.",1409961600,,2607,4.671806167400881

This movie is easy to watch because of the two leads who look like they are fun to be bored with but like so many other offerings set in Tokyo by America - they never make Tokyo look fun - there are no investigative long shots of retail shelving - there are none in Karl Pilkington and Anthony Bourdain's visits either.

1495102,5,B00005JMJ4,"I was utterly and completely moved by this film.

I first watched it my freshman year of college, alone in my dorm room because I had nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon. After watching the film, I sat on my bed for about an hour just thinking about it.

Yes, the movie moves slowly, but that's part of what makes it so good, I think. We get to spend time with Bob and Charlotte, and we get to know them and to see who they are as people. What's really important in this movie is that they don't really have much of a physically relationship. It's purely emotional, and it's kind of beautiful. Bob and Charlotte are two very lonely people struggling to find meaning in where they are in life, and when together, things are maybe a little more clear.

I just think this is one of the most beautiful, most moving films I have ever seen. I came across it at a time in my life where I could see all of myself in Charlotte. I was stuck, unsure of where I wanted to be, of who I was. And I was lonely. It was almost a catharsis seeing Charlotte find herself a little in someone else, in seeing her be a little less lonely.

I think this movie is one people will either love or hate. Either you get it, or you don't. And I certainly hope everyone considering watching this movie is in the ""get it/love it"" group, because this film is one that is truly special.",1403913600,,1360,4.159695817490494

1495104,4,B00005JMJ4,"It's rare when one movie is able to capture the essence of true loneliness and fellowship, but LOST IN TRANSLATION is such a film. Each one of us knows what it is like to be surrounded by many people, yet feel totally and completely alone. At the same time, all of us also know what it is like to find true fellowship with someone; not the masked, skin-deep appearances that many mistake for friendship, but the true soul-connecting fellowship that alleviates the pain that loneliness leaves. That's part of what LOST IN TRANSLATION is about. It also has some other things to say: to truly enjoy life you have to know yourself; people can be friends without being lovers; and sometimes the smallest things in life are the most meaningful.

This is Bill Murray's finest performance to date and he'll probably get an Oscar nomination.
The movie is definitely not for everyone. It moves really slow, even in the ""fast"" scenes. Also, for a character driven film, there isn't much dialogue either. Instead, the characters are brought to life by what we see them do, which to be honest isn't much. However, what they actually do, is what many people actually do every day anyway. Here is a reality film that seems truly real. My only real complaint about the film was the unnecessary scene in the strip club; it doesn't add anything to the plot nor does it give the audience any deeper insight into the main characters. If it wasn't for that one scene, the movie probably would be PG-13 instead of R.

Overall, this is a movie not for the typical movie-goer. It's not the usual independent type of film either. Instead, it's a breed of a different kind and if you're in the mood for something different, this maybe for what you're looking.",1402531200,3,1733,4.641693811074918

But if you like to occasionally see a window on everyday life--albeit amongst a show biz elite with unlimited funds--you'll find Lost In Translation well worth seeing. It is not about things happening, about plot points, but about simply BEing; in an alien environment in an alienated state of mind. It is very much about mood and feelings that simply circle around and never really arrive anywhere. It is about how people who have no reason to connect, somehow do, temporarily, because of these strange circumstances they're in. It is a purely existential movie, about existence as it is often lived. Moreover, it offers a wonderful sort of cinematic portrait of a Great City that defies definition--Tokyo.

Jumping from one place to another and expecting the viewer to have imagine the continuity of how the character get from one place to another with out showing every little step or have an insert or cutaway between different scene.

1495488,1,B00005JMJ4,"There are almost 2000 reviews of this movie here. With that kind of sample, the customer review graph of stars awarded is very telling.

The media reviews and promotion for this movie defy reality in ways I've not previously seen. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone said, ""Flat out hilarious!"", but not about the movie as the DVD cover misleads you to believe, but about one mildly funny scene. The exclamation mark is a fabrication for the movie's promotion. But Travers does say ""...Sophia Coppola's altogether remarkable .. class-act ..."", which is just as flat out hilarious! And even funnier than that is that this almost completely improvised movie won Sofia Coppola a ""Best Original Screenplay"" Academy Award! If you ever doubted Hollywood was a suck-up kind of town, doubt no longer.

In the final unscripted scene, Bill Murray says something to Scarlett Johansson that we don't hear because it wasn't in the script and the screenwriter couldn't come up with a line. She couldn't find a line because in her mind no line existed. As director she wanted the scene, but as screenwriter she had nothing. And for coming up with nothing in the most important scene in the movie, she got the Oscar, when every other writer would have got the sack. There's only one good explanation for that - Executive Producer : Francis Ford Coppola.",1378252800,7,1334,4.872246696035242

1495576,3,B00005JMJ4,"Scarlett Johannson meets my expectations of a competent actor: She is able to leap from her own plebeian personality and transform herself into a literate, sensitive, beautiful young woman. Perhaps directorial magic is the only explanation. She left me enchanted.

Murray, on the other hand, is the same boorish culturally-deficient zero that he undoubtedly is in real life. He does not act. He reads lines and takes stage direction. If he had not been a cult figure from Saturday Night Live, he could have been a Chevy salesman. Or a weatherman. Somehow, he has found his way from Punxsutawney to Tokyo. The character experiences the same culture shock in both locations, the same lack of affect, the same insensitivity. I would not want to sit at the same table with Bill Murray at a dinner party in real life. In movieland, his characters never transcend his personal limitations.

The movie itself is very touching. The most tragic element is the interaction of the young married couple, who are so walled-off by their narcissism that their only communication is sexual. No wonder this literate sensitive woman feels alienated enough to be attracted to Bill Murray.

This movie could have been much better. Imagine the leads as played by a young Maura Tierney and an elderly Will Smith.

This movie could have been worse. Imagine the male lead played by Steven Seagall or William Shatner. Or Mel Gibson. Now add Drew Barrymore or Reese Witherspoon to the mix.

1495695,5,B00005JMJ4,"An engaging film in an unassuming way, Lost in Translation relies on the dynamics of character relationships and subtleties to portray a real story devoid of the cliches, plot crutches, and visual effects that go hand in hand with traditional entertainment.  In this sense, Lost in Translation is not a movie for those who only desire to be entertained, but for those who want to experience real characters and a subtle, unexpected story that is well developed by the talent herein.  While ""entertainment"" is certainly valuable, at times I feel we should approach films, and certainly this film, without the expectation of being entertained, but with emptied expectations, thus allowing the film, its characters, and its story to move you.  If you approach the film this way, I believe you will find yourself surprisingly involved in these characters' lives, in their seemingly mundane, but authentic struggles, and in the philosophical search for meaning amidst the world of entertainment, loneliness, and distraction so well portrayed in the film's landscapes.

For the engaging subtleties and talent aforementioned, this is truly the only film that I can watch again and again and still notice new elements in the plot and relationships that revitalize the film and highlight how well each aspect flows together like words in a poem.  To know whether you will enjoy this film or any film, you must ask yourself what kind of audience you will be, and allow yourself to become the audience the creators of this film envisioned.",1363392000,,1528,5.096

BM is sublime as the jaded middle aged American film star on assignment abroad; in a role he was born to play. Scarlett Johansson is equally convincing as the sensitive and lonely newlywed whose chance meeting with Murray in Tokyo morphs into an unlikely search for love and life's meaning. Old and new Japan as experienced by both outsiders, its glitz and tradition, holds an increasingly beguiling fascination that becomes an intriguing movie theme in itself. The Zen like soundtrack: an eclectic mix of western and oriental song and sound simply magnifies the disjuncture banality and beauty of modern urban Japan.

This movie is very unique. It has a very roller coaster like vibe. One minute you're feeling lonely and down, then all of a sudden you're at a night club or an arcade or singing karaoke. The two characters are both very different, but find common ground and become close.

Bill Murray's performance in this definitely ranks among his best, probably at the very top. Scarlett Johansson's screen time fares just as well, deserving the notion that this was her true ""breakthrough"" to stardom. The chemistry the two actors have while wearing the skin of their characters isn't all-out electric, but rather subtle and constrained--more of a minor static-energy shock than a lightning strike. Yet, that's precisely the tone that the story needed: two strangers stranded in a strange land, not quite nostalgic about home but concerned about finding themselves.

Most everyone who watches this film can relate to either of the main characters.  It doesn't matter if you are in your 20s trying to figure everything out, or if you are middle-aged trying to understand where your life went and if there is anything left in the future.

  Lost in Translation is about two people with a 30-year age gap, who find that essentially their life situations are not so different.

  Scarlett  Johanssen is Charlotte.  She is in Japan with her husband who is a photographer.  He is in Japan on assignment to cover a band.  She tags along because she didn't figure there was anything else for her to do.  She spends much of her time staring out of the window of her hotel room wondering if there is anything else to her life.  Where is her life going?  How can she get out of the rut she feels she is in?

  Bill Murray, (who turns in the best performance of his career and who has already stated that ""Lost in Translation"" is his favorite film of his body of work) is Bob Harris, a famous American actor who is in Japan to shoot a commercial to promote Suntori Whiskey.  He doesn't want to be there.  He is a man going through the motions, and for all of his professional success, wonders why he doesn't seem especially happy and if it is too late to start any kind of a new life.

 In many ways, these two characters compliment each other and provide for each other with the necessary vision to realize that they can make changes to their lives and perhaps realize that there is still something good and wonderful to live for.  Bob helps Charlotte to see the possibilities ahead of her, while Charlotte helps Bob to appreciate the life he has, even though he now knows that he needs a new focus.

 Bob sees the road he has already travelled while Charlotte only sees a road of unknowns.  She explains that she feels stuck.  She has tried her hand at different things without any kind of real fulfillment.  She has tried writing and photography without any kind of feeling of accomplishment.  Bob explains that he isn't worried about her at all because she is young and she will figure it out (which is probably similar to what he did at her age).  Bob, on the other hand, seems to feel almost cut-off from everyone.  Part of this is self-imposed as he seems to constantly be dodging fans who interrupt him while he is trying to enjoy a quiet moment at the hotel bar.  However, he talks to his wife who sounds more than just annoyed with him on the phone.  She sends him faxes at 4:00am about carpet samples.  One has to wonder if she really feels she needs his input, or if it is simply a way for her to have some kind of a conversation with him, even if it is about something as mundane as what color of carpet should be picked for his study.  He finally confesses to his wife on the phone, ""I'm lost.""

  There is something to be said for two ""lost"" souls who find each other in Tokyo, Japan.  Neither one, it seems, is particularly happy to be in Japan.  Neither one is able to sleep, and so they meet at the hotel bar.  There must be something there, as Bob sends a small smile across the room to Charlotte after she buys him a drink.  Somehow, Bob realizes that this is not another admiring fan.  He sees something genuine in Charlotte.  Before long, the two begin to spend some time together.

  The time they spend together is only the foundation.  Soon, they begin to have conversations, each sharing about where they are in life and why they don't seem to be particularly happy.  Charlotte begins to see possibilities in Bob, and Bob begins to see new vision of life (one he's forgotten) in Charlotte.  The irony of the relationship is in the friendship and how each is able to provide some level of healing to the other.  However, given Bob's age and life experience, it is clear that he is the leader of the relationship.  Charlotte is worried about her life, but Bob tells her, ""The more you know yourself and what you want, the less you let things upset you.""  However, the irony of when Bob tells Charlotte this, he realizes that he needs to remember this himself.  Another example is when Charlotte finds out that Bob has spent the night with a woman.  It's obvious she is upset and a tad jealous.  Bob wisely retorts, ""Wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?""  Charlotte doesn't take the statement well, at first, until she realizes on some level that this is exactly what she wants: attention; someone to let her know that they care about her.  Her husband tells her that he loves her, but then he's out the door.  She wants someone to be with her.  And it is this element that now seems to be missing in her marriage.

  Charlotte's husband, John, tries to be there for her, but he is so caught up in his work, that it is obvious that Charlotte has become secondary for him even though it is clear that he loves her.  Charlotte feels she is little more than another piece of luggage simply brought along for the trip.  She even states, ""I don't know who I married.""

  After a few days together, Bob tells her that he doesn't want to leave, when just a few days prior, he would have given anything to get out of Japan.  Charlotte has become a window to the possibility of a new life.  And for Charlotte, Bob is a light to a path that was once dark.  This is how each serves the other.  It is obvious that the two love each other.  It isn't so much of a romantic love as it is a genuine, loving friendship, and when it is time for them to part, as much as it hurts, brings the realization that it is time for each to go their own way.

  Sofia Coppola masterfully navigates the story without it becoming two mired down in melodrama.  She keeps things simple and real, which is probably why so many viewers find themselves relating to the characters and the story.  It could be anyone, and this is why it works so well.

  People don't often realize that strange surroundings and a stranger can be just the necessary ingredients for change and redirection and a refocus of one's life.  These types of ingredients can create a kind of bubble, which it does for Charlotte and Bob.  While they do interact with other people, it is about them in a small world created by each of them.  An environment which seems to foreign can be exactly what one needs to reach out to someone.  I don't think Charlotte would have met Bob if they had been in America.  Why would they?  In Japan, the environment allows each of them to stand out just enough to get the attention of the other.

  Lost in Translation is one of my favorite films of the last decade, and the magic is in the story of two realistic characters who are trying to figure out their lives.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen play their roles perfectly, as if each truly knows and understands their characters.  Ironically, this is what most people are trying to do every, single day of their lives.",1338508800,3,6942,4.398739164696612
1496053,4,B00005JMJ4,"I am not a ScarJo or Bill Murray fan (except for his golf movie), though both have done several good works.  For those seeking action, this movie will disappoint.  For people who like character studies with more than a touch of real-life situations and choices, this is a GOOD movie.  Though Hollywood would have us believe such encounters always end in sex, and often regrets, my own experiences, and those of many others I know, found companionship on lone trips that made the trip nicer, even if no follow-up was expected or done.  It's ok to meet (in my case) a gal where sex is not on the menu.  I enjoy meeting people.  I'm not married.  So while some think me a potential threat, I'm not handsome or debonair, just an intelligent guy who likes to share experiences with someone interesting.  Some women don't care for that, some do.  The movie reflects the latter, and I found it interesting as an older/younger relationship based on two bored people looking for that companionship.  I thought it well done, and just realistic enough to enjoy.  Too much gratuitous sex in too many movies to titillate the youngsters, and this brought it back to more human.  Good movie for a relaxing evening, even with a girlfriend (it's not threatening) or casual date.  Some nice scenery in Japan, and points up Tokyo's horrendous urban jungle.  I recommend it for those who aren't looking for slam-bang action or new sexual thrills, that just want to see how men and women can enjoy each other as people.  And the BluRay version is a good transfer.",1337126400,3,1542,4.680297397769516

This is the rarest of the rare, a true comedy of manners, impeccably done, poking fun at two different cultures. It is sweet, incisive, sardonic, illuminating, morose, funny and sad. Bill Murray is a genius. There is no other actor I can think of who could have pulled off his role. Marlon Brando maybe. The character of Bob Harris is achingly real. When Murray was younger I always wondered if he would ever be able to completely immerse himself in a character without showing flashes of his Bill Murray persona. The answer is yes, he can. It is amazing just to watch him act in this movie. But everyone is good. Who knew that Anna Faris could act? Scarlett Johansson is excellent. Giovanni Ribisi is always strong, but in this movie, like Murray, he disappears into his role. Great work.

For those of you who don't get this movie, I understand why you don't get it, but this is an absolutely brilliant movie. One of the best movies ever made. If you think this movie is boring, you do not yet understand what life is about. Hint, it's really not about car chases.

Whoever thinks that way has either missed the whole point of the film or has never been ""lost"" themselves in a similar situation.

But I should qualify: the feeling of getting lost depicted in this movie goes even beyond the process of translation and dislocation since the characters Bill Harris  (the B-list celebrity) and Charlotte (young wife of a photographer) are lost even before setting foot in Japan anyways. They are lost ""in the original"", in their original lives back in the United States as well. That's why I've viewed this fine and unusual work several times not as a critique of ""what Japan does to Americans"" but ""what modern high-paced professional life does to normal human beings who yearn for affection and genuine human contacts.""

There are no car chases in this movie. No sex scenes. No blood and gore. But there is plenty of sensitivity, many scenes that lay bare our predicament as temporary creatures on this earth with infinite hearts and yearnings.

1496154,5,B00005JMJ4,"The first minutes of Sofia Coppola's best film to date are quite revealing: A woman, Scarlett Johansson, is in a five star hotel, beholding Tokyo's skyline. A man, Bill Murray, looks through a car's window, curious perhaps, but above all estranged. Combining a deeply poignant music with suggestive images, the director creates a world, a filmic universe that captures our attention immediately. What Sofia Coppola does in the opening frames is what many filmmakers struggle to achieve in their entire careers.

Throughout the film there is always a certain feeling of longing, of loneliness; longing for a different tomorrow, and loneliness as the confirmation that the one constant in human condition is discontent. Many critics must have explored the lack of communication as a fundamental key in ""Lost in Translation"", both as the obvious reference of the title and also as an indicator of all that we can't put into language.

Perhaps in the best role of his career, Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed-out actor that used to be a super star and now has to endorse a Japanese whisky to make a couple of million bucks. He feels like an alien in Tokyo. But he's also a specular image of the Japanese people's own alienated condition. Westernized to the extreme, the Japanese have lost their essence, they are the living example of how further can people go in order to disallow themselves.

Giovanni Ribisi's character, a professional photographer also ponders on it: Japanese rock and roll groups that have no substance and exist only thanks to the decoration, the false reality that photography and the right publicity stunt can imprint on them. The photographer is there to sustain the alienation process, even if he disagrees with the falseness of it all.

In the same way, Bob Harris has to synthetize in a TV commercial what the Japanese consider the core of Western elegance and sophistication. He is asked to be Roger Moore, Frank Sinatra, he is asked to perform not as the white man he is but as the white man they need him to be. Of course, there can be no words or guidelines for such a taxing acting job. And that's why also it's impossible for the interpreters to translate the instructions given to him. Not only are words lost in translation, but also there is an unnamed need, a `real' that threatens to irrupt into reality, and as Lacan explains in his psychoanalytic theory, the real exceeds the language, the real can never exist within the boundaries of the symbolic, id est, language.

Bob Harris is an exhausted man that finds alcohol soothing, although just barely. After 25 years of marriage he is unhappy. Between him and his wife no real communication exists. What takes place, however, is a very insistent simulacrum, much in the same way that everything takes place in Japan. Philosopher Alan Badiou's talks about the importance of the simulacrum in postmodern society (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Theory-of-the-Subject/dp/0826496733/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Theory of the Subject</a>); if Sofia Coppola's film is more revealing and enthralling than anything else out there is precisely because it embraces contemporaneity to the maximum; this isn't a film about explanations, about outcomes, which would be a modernist approach; this is a postmodern film in the way that it sates our hunger for art, for beauty and for intellectual value while establishing what Derrida proposed in his deconstruction theory: knowledge can never be complete. When Bob's wife sends him a fax, or Fed-Exes carpet samples, or calls him, it's all a simulacrum. They are never able to connect with each other, not even at the most basic of levels.

In the same manner, Charlotte, extraordinarily interpreted by Scarlett Johansson seems to be drifting away. She's married to a successful photographer but she can't figure out what to do with her time. There is no meaning for life, and that thought depresses her and fills her heart with anguish. She tries to get into self-help audiobooks to feel better, to no avail. The entire boom of auto-help material is also an example of Badiou's simulacrum; thousands if not millions of these books are written each year, and yet they are all useless. Life cannot be summarized, standardized and explained so that you can feel better. But despair takes the best of us all, and thus self-help becomes the one and only thing that sells out nowadays.

When Charlotte and Bob meet in the hotel's bar, they recognize in the other the same existential doubts, the same sensibilities, and they feel connected. They are the only characters able to actually communicate with each other. Their bond is intensified when contrasted with the world around them, for example, with Charlotte's Japanese friends who are so absolutely alienated and have tried so hard to look and act like Americans that end up as ridiculous and pathetic creatures. Tokyo is a city that denies its past, its traditions, so much that it's simply brutal to see how its inhabitants behave.

However, there is still some true beauty left (beauty as it would be understood in the Genji Monogatari (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japanese-Literature-Including-Selections-From-Genji-Monogatari-and-Classical-Poetry-and-Drama-of-Japan/dp/021785527X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japanese Literature; Including Selections From Genji Monogatari and Classical Poetry and Drama of Japan</a>) and other traditional Japanese works of art), and Coppola gives us a glimpse of it, in a couple of moments. Nevertheless, this beauty, this true spirit, is constantly covered by the appalling reality that surrounds the protagonists. When Bob Harris receives the visit of a woman wearing sexy stockings, we are privy to yet another example of westernized acculturation and fantasies, although here the fantasy instead of covering the horror of the real merely exacerbates the void, the structural fissures of Japan's society.

Sofia Coppola's masterwork resonates deeply inside of us because it's one of the most refined and superb portrayals of the human condition in cinema's history. The final scene, of course, proves once again that there is no such thing as a happy ending, and precisely because of that it reminds us that life is just like that, unpredictable, full of suffering but also possibilities of change and, of course, free will. Lost in Translation makes it into my personal top twenty without a second thought.",1320796800,7,6506,5.278260869565218
1496155,5,B00005JMJ4,"This movie vividly captures the feeling of being depaysee (out of one's familiar surroundings). The main characters are both lost in Japan, unmoored and lonely, tired, unable to sleep, jet-lagged and confused. Coppola captures this ethos perfectly. The setting is magnificent- a luxurious but cold hotel in Tokyo and the lights/sounds/swirling/frenetic activity in the streets below. Bill Murray nails the jaded Bob and his midlife crisis perfectly. Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte is just realizing that her marriage is not all she expected it to be and that no marriage can provide her with the life direction she is seeking. Charlotte and Bob are both intelligent and highly attuned to the nonsense (e.g. Charlotte's husband's self-absorption, the inanity spewed by the actress Kelly, the artiness of the crew directing the commercial) that surrounds them. High above the Tokyo streets, both protagonists are trapped in their luxurious but cold setting and the two forge an ambiguous, tender bond. It is to Coppola's credit that the bond remains ambiguous to the end (what did they say to one another in the final scene?) and that the movie avoids the traps that could so easily have ensued had the two had allowed the obvious attraction between them to become explicitly sexual. Coppola allows Bob and Charlotte's story to unfold in its own messy,goofy, unclassifiable way. The scenes involving the filming of the whiskey commercial are hysterical. The scene where Murray sings ""More than this"" at the Karaoke bar perfectly captures the film's spirit: unpolished, ambiguous, heartfelt and ironic.",1318204800,4,1599,5.324110671936759
1496156,5,B00005JMJ4,"If you read any number of these reviews, you'll be able to read a very long synopsis of this move. Also, if you were to check out the product description, you'd get another synopsis. And I assume if you're thinking of purchasing 'Lost in Translation [Blu-ray]', chances are you've already seen this movie. So, I'm not going to go into the synopsis of this movie. The only question you're asking yourself is, is the Blu-ray worth the upgrade? As a Japanese major, currently in the United States, hoping to spend my life their after college, and as someone who is such a big fan of this movie they bought the DVD, Blu-ray, Soundtrack, and have a giant poster of Scarlett Johansson walking through '' (Shibuya) on my wall, I can tell you that this movie is definitely one to purchase on Blu-ray.

The only disappointment about this version, is that the same bonus features from the DVD are included. There is nothing new to be seen. It would've been nice to have an interview with the cast and crew now, or at least just the director, Sofia Coppola, about their thoughts on the movie. But sadly, nothing. Other than the lack of new and exciting features, there are no other down sides.

The best part about the movie, was not only was it specifically reformatted to fit all the new fancy 1080p widescreen TVs perfectly, but there are scenes in the movie (not all) but the ones that count, have been digitally remastered, and look better than ever!

(As mentioned) not every scene has been remastered. But the opening scene where Bob Harris (Bill Murray) first arrives in Tokyo, and the best (and my favorite sequence) the montage of when Charlotte  (Scarlett Johansson) goes to '' (Kyoto) look better than ever. And these scenes alone, are the reason why you should upgrade to the Blu-ray.

So basically, if you're as big a fan of this movie as I am, you'll enjoy this version. That's pretty much it.",1315180800,22,1897,4.617210682492582
1496157,5,B00005JMJ4,"RELEASED IN 2003 and written & directed by Sofia Coppola, ""Lost in Translation"" was a big hit in 2003-2004. It's about an aging actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who's in Tokyo doing commercials for a week. His home-life is mundane and he's experiencing a bit of the mid-life crisis. He runs into an attractive 20 year-old something woman, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who's in Tokyo with her photog husband (), but he's gone most of the time and takes her for granted.

This is a mature, semi-arty film and you have to be in the right mode/maturity level to appreciate it. I said ""maturity level"" and not ""age"" because some people are pretty mature at 16 while others are completely immature at 50. For me, the story, music and visuals pulled me into these characters temporary world for the 102-minute runtime.

The film succeeds as an amusing social commentary and a deep love story, as well as a visual/musical delight. I'll only focus on the deep love element. It's been noted that the story originated from Sofia's experience with an aging actor when she was younger, possibly Harrison Ford. Sofia is obviously Charlotte, while Charlotte's husband is Sofia's ex and Anna Faris plays the role of the other woman, which would be Cameron Diaz in real life. So there's a lot of reality in the picture.

But it's not just a cathartic piece. Sofia has some potent insights to offer on the nature of true romantic love. For one, love transcends age difference (Bob is about 35 years older than Charlotte). For another, it's possible to be married and experience romantic love for another. Not that this ever justifies adultery, it's just a fact. As the story progresses you'll see how comfortable Bob and Charlotte are with each other, how they look into each other's eyes, the windows of the soul, in a profoundly naked sense. This can happen in the flash of a moment where the two people just KNOW, or it can take place over a period of time, as is the case with Bob and Charlotte (which is a handful of days). They see the same things and speak the same language, and I don't mean English. But this presents a conundrum for Bob. Bob COULD take advantage of Charlotte because she's so lonely in a sea of people, which is one of the movie's themes; she's also inexperienced and vulnerable. Will he or won't he take advantage?

***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.

If Bob loves Charlotte so much, not to mention his wife & kids, why does he have a one-night stand with the lounge singer (Catherine Lambert)? Bob slept with her to release sexual tension that had been building up between him and Charlotte. This was a moral failure, but keep in mind he was drunk (another failure but, have pity, he was going through a mid-life crisis). While all this is obvious, it goes deeper...

Bob could have taken advantage of Charlotte if he wanted to but didn't because he genuinely loved her, which is revealed at the end. Bob could sleep with the singer because he didn't love her (not that it justifies his actions). Simply put, true love transcends sexual expression and sexual union does not equal love.

The ending is powerful and tear-inducing. No CGI, explosion or action stunt can compare. It's just an older man and a too-young woman embracing in the midst of 20 million strangers. Tears flow, kisses are given and unheard words are whispered. They could never be a couple, even if they weren't married, and they know they'll never see each other again, at least on this physical plane, but their love has been expressed and will be treasured for eternity.

1496158,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is a great film starring Bill Murray who plays a successful actor named Bob.  Bob happens to be a millionaire who commands popularity and acceptance in Japan.  He is living in two worlds where he is striving to meet the needs of his employer, and that of his wife and family back home in the states.  He meets a college graduate named Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson) who also happens to be married and is accompanying her successful photographer husband to Japan. Charlotte plays a woman who loves her husband, but is also in the process of finding her professional role in life.  Charlotte's husband cares for her tremendously, but is unable to spend as much time with her as he would like due to work commitments.  Charlotte and Bob cross paths and end up being temporary friends in Japan.  They explore the various clubs and hangouts in Tokyo with their friends.  I do believe that this film had a strong story because it covers the universal themes of how essential it is to create a plan on where you want to go in life, and to creatively construct new plans  if and/or when setbacks occur.  For Charlotte she is only experiencing a temporary setback of pinpointing where she intends to professionally in her life. For Bob, he is doing fine professionally but he too is setting a new intention in his life (except more in his family arena).  I liked watching this film because it brought back some positive memories I had of  when I was living in Japan (via the U.S. military) during the time period of September 2000 until October 2003.

I guess, I kept hoping a plot would actually appear.  The only movie I ever seen that was worse than this one (that I actually managed to see the whole thing) was the Batman & Robin movie with George Clooney.

I wanted to watch it because of good marks that Hollywood and the critics gave it and sat down thinking this would be a great and moving movie.  But I found it utterly boring and struggled to watch it to the end.  The actors are usually wonderful in what they do(LOVED SJ in Girl With the Pearl Earring), but even they need something to work with.  Bill Murray is one of my favorites, but this was clearly not the venue for him.

If the plot was about how hopeless and boring and meaningless life can be, then making a movie that was hopeless and boring and meaningless is not the way to go.  Tell a story, you silly people!!!!  This was a complete waste of time and film and the critics who love it so much need to seriously sit back and take stock of what makes a good plot and good characters and why we go to movies in the first place.  Of course, a movie can have deeper meaning to it (and should), but that should never get in the way of the story.  This story was ever so much about Hollywood patting itself on the back for being so cool and trendy and uber-intelligent, similar in some ways to another movie ""I Heart Huckabees.""

1496238,5,B00005JMJ4,"I don't understand all the negative reviews undoubtedly coming from people who have the attention span of the Jersey shore generation and otherwise feel like they are falling into a coma if things aren't moving at MTV pace. This movie was so well written and acted, thoughtful, genuine, touching and incredibly romantic that any negative review I see must stem from the audience simply not understanding this movie. Of course if you want some rom-com, bang-wang predictable formula, this won't be the movie for you. The beauty of this piece lies in the subtleties of the performances and the portrayal of the characters. Bill Murray has outdone himself in terms of acting skill. He is superb in his role as the apathetic, bored, middle-aged movie star stuck in the artificial confines of some luxury hotel in Tokyo to do a whiskey commercial. He is always in character and he never, ever becomes Bill Murray for even just one second, resulting in a believable and powerful performance. This part was written for him and I doubt any other actor could have pulled off what he did. Scarlett Johansson has an innocence to her that is only complemented by her intelligence and the serenity she exhumes. They could not have cast anyone better for this part. In fact, Murray and Johansson have great chemistry, despite the almost thirty five years age difference between them.

Murray plays Bob Harris. He's married and has children, but he feels stuck and tired. He is in Japan to do a commercial for money but his heart is not in it and he's lost his drive and seems mostly on autopilot when going about his business. His marriage is stagnant and his wife keeps sending him tile and wall-paper patterns to chose from but other than that doesnt really talk to him really or otherwise shows any interest in him as a person. She just says what needs to be said, like she was closing a business deal, and then hangs up. Charlotte (played by Johansson) is a Yale philosophy graduate in town with her her not particularly bright celebrity photographer husband John to whom she has been married for two years and who doesnt give her the time of day. She reflects on how her husband has changed during two years of marriage and how her own life lacks direction. Her husband, in fact, seems to have more in common with a light-headed starlet they meet in the hotel, than with his own wife. He even tells her that she needs to relax because ""not everyone went to Yale."" He then leaves her behind in the hotel while he is off for his assignment.

People got this movie all wrong believing it to be about the friendship between two lonely people or that it is about traveling to far off lands and being homesick. Far from it. This is a love story. However, that is really beside the point because the beauty of this movie lies in how this love story is told. The protagonists don't do the obvious things expected in such movies like sleep with each other (even though they could) or otherwise have a steamy affair that ends with separation and tears. No. That would have been cheap and predictable.

This movie is about two people who find themselves in the same place and time with contrasting perspectives. Each is afflicted by different yet parallel doubts about the course their life respectively is taking or has taken. These two are drawn to each other and able to be completely honest and unguarded with the other BECAUSE they are strangers without any messy attachment from the past. The conversations they have are at the heart of this and their loneliness is compounded by the noisy, chaotic, neon-filled Tokyo background which I think - despite crowds - is a very isolating and lonely place really.

I loved this movie because it threw two unlikely people together and forged an unexpected, intense relationship. It is a story that is mostly about the things that aren't said and done, than about what is explicitly uttered. The ending is powerful because when he whispers something in her ear on the congested streets of Tokyo, we don't get to hear what it is nor do we ever find out. The effect is a strong ending that is not predictable but remains true to the film's elegance, subtlety and depth. As someone once said, maybe he gave her his phone number, or said he loved her. Or said she was a good person. Or thanked her. Or whispered, ""Had we but world enough, and time..."" and left her to look up the rest of it.",1297296000,6,4414,4.619108280254777
1496239,5,B00005JMJ4,"There aren't many films on Amazon that can generate as many reviews as this one has received and this alone should tip you off to the unique nature of `Lost in Translation'. I won't add another synopsis here when other reviewers have done it so well before and Amazon explain the general premise in their product description. I agree with other reviewers who state that the beauty in this film derives from the smallest touch or glance between Charlotte and Bob rather than from an in-depth, convoluted plot line. Or it comes from the music (by Kevin Shields) that perfectly compliments the feelings of separation from the characters own lives and from the city they are exploring together, or from the fact that Coppola manages to deliver a film that is both poignant and entertaining without ramming any messages down your throat like most Hollywood films are inclined to do. I tend to feel Bill Murray has rarely acted better than in this film and saying that, the same applies to Scarlett Johannsson, both play their roles superbly with just the right amount of humour and seriousness to lend it credibility. The film feels more ethereal and unreal as it progresses due to the characters prolonged jet lag and insomnia and their intense personal connection amidst the confusion of Tokyo and it is this element that I'm sure loses and gains it many fans. It is also infused with that sense of delicious melancholy you can sometimes feel, without making you feel sad or low. Bob and Charlotte's friendship quickly develops until, in a seeming contradiction, it is very much a romantic plutonic relationship and it is this aspect of the film that sustains it when it could feel too slow or spaced out, as it keeps your interest engaged. If you come to this film expecting a Hollywood all action blockbuster you will disappointed, but if you come to this expecting a unique and brief snapshot of two peoples lives as they spend time together learning about themselves and each other, then you should enjoy this to the full and see what all the hype is about. You'll either love it or hate it but I guess it's one to watch and make your own mind up about either way.

The movie itself is great, it's by far one of my favorites.
As for the blu-ray vs. dvd, I must have watched the dvd atleast 30 times.  I've been over every inch of it.  When I got the blu-ray I went directly to the extras and was immediately disappointed with the complete lack of anything new (aside from a trailer for Sofia C. new movie).
The picture quality is a little more defined but not where I wanted it to be.
Most of the film is shot in poorly lit rooms and results in some pixilation in the dark parts.

1496335,4,B00005JMJ4,"I had to watch this film a few times to understand it but for most people this is a slow film but for me, its watching one of my favorite actors at his best.  I do mean Bill Murray, who is at a role that was made for him.  I wish he won the oscar that year but he lost to Sean Penn for Mystic River.  Either way this is a film about the understanding of one culture to another.  With shots done well of the Japanese structures and landscapes, it made this film so serene that I felt at peace when I was watching Scarlett Johannson skipping on the stones in a lake.  It was not only that, it is about Bob Harris a man in a midlife crisis who befriends a girl who was just as lost as he is in a country unknown to them.

Just so you would know there were other actors who won so many awards for a single role like Bill Murray that the only thing they did not win is the Oscar.  There were actors that were viewed to come so close to winning an Oscar it surprised the critics who thought they would win.

I am not sure how far it goes this is the earliest I can think of:

Bob Hoskins for Best Actor in Mona Lisa (1986)losing to Paul Newman of The Color of Money (1986)

Clive Owen for Best Supporting Actor in Closer (2004) losing to Morgan Freeman of Million Dollar Baby (2004)

Eddie Murphy for Best Supporting Actor in Dreamgirls (2006) losing to Alan Arkin of Little Miss Sunshine (2006)

1496336,5,B00005JMJ4,"For insightful analysis of the essential qualities that make Lost in Translation a masterpiece, I suggest that Amazon customers read the Editorial Review by Doug Thomas and the featured customer reviews by Matthew Gladney and M.Burns.  But I will add that I saw this film when it first reached the theaters because The Virgin Suicides had convinced me of Sofia Coppola's brilliance as a director and because I was anxious to see a Bill Murray performance which had received such extraordinary critical acclaim.  I did not anticipate that when I left the theater that day, my heart would be aching from the whispered but almost unbearable tenderness of that ""grace note"" near the end to which Doug Thomas refers.  I went back five or six times before the film left town, and I bought the DVD the day it was released.  I am not condemning the views of those who do not respond to this film.  We respond according to the various ways in which our hearts are configured.  I know brilliant, sensitive music critics, for example, who simply cannot stand Mozart but love Wagner.  But if you are the kind of person who is fond of well-made, subtle, bittersweet love stories which move at a slow pace but build up astonishing power along the way, then you should at least consider watching Lost in Translation.  If I were a billionaire, and I knew that Sofia Coppola could make another film like this, but only if I footed the entire cost, with no promise of making a penny, I would write a hundred million dollar check in a heartbeat.",1294099200,,1526,4.646840148698884

1496340,4,B00005JMJ4,"I saw LIT before I had ever been to Japan. The movie seemed a bit strange and I wondered why Bill Murray was in such a flat, depressing comedy about really nothing at all. I didn't get it. In Spring of 2005, not long after I had returned from three weeks in Shinjuku, Tokyo I watched it again. Now the familiarity of the location really captured my attention. I had stayed at the Hilton Tokyo, just two blocks from the Park Hyatt hotel Bob Harris (Murray's character) was in. This is not me trying to brag or anything, but me just saying that the movie now presented a reality I had recently experienced. I could relate. It was almost surreal. My company had sent me there solo for three weeks to work with a customer. I was by myself a good amount of the time and had a lot of freedom to experience Tokyo as best I could. Navigating the subway, surfing the hotel TV stations (most all in Japanese, except BBC), and experiencing a few restaurants, shops, and grocers were among my biggest adventures. This is not a review of my trip, but my newfound love of Tokyo made so many moments in the movie stand out. When Bob is surfing the hotel stations you catch a few seconds of World Chart Express, something I watched A LOT of and how I came to know about YUKI and discover my favorite song of 2005, ""Joy"". Also when Bob is just arriving into Tokyo from the airport and just looks so beat, but is kind of in awe of the lights and brilliance of the city... that was me. I remember getting to the hotel about midnight and not really being able to sleep. Anyway, the movie just really struck a chord with me in many ways. I also picked up on and could relate to the general theme of the movie about two lonely people out of their element. Anyway, Murray's humor here is very understated but still very Bill Murray. I find it hilarious at times, but not strictly a comedy. There are a lot of quiet moments that get you thinking about what's important in life, and about finding or searching for someone, if only a friend, that you are really comfortable being with. Don't let all the bad reviews scare you off. Even if you've never been to Tokyo you may still find a lot to like about LIT.",1290470400,10,2183,4.288135593220339
1496341,5,B00005JMJ4,"I've seen Bill Murray's older work (let's face it, Caddyshack is quintessential Bill Murray) and was curious to check him out in a more mature, serious role.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  ""Lost in Translation"" has since become one of my most favorite movies by Murray and in general.  People looking for some kind of ""Shopgirl""-esque May-November relationship between the two main characters will be sorely disappointed; this movie is more about the lost art of developing truly platonic relationships with people of different gender and maybe more uncomfortably, age.  Bill Murray plays a fading middle-aged star who wants nothing more than a friend and unlike Steve Martin's exceptionally self-centered middle age man in Shopgirl, Murray's character is much more likeable.

It's easy to take this movie too literally and find it maybe even repulsive that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen might not be sexually attracted to each other but the beauty of this film is that, regardless of conventional social mores, it can be normal to have a platonic relationship with a person of the opposite sex.  Its not for Bill Murray fans expecting him to be the comic relief but if you give it a chance, it may end up pleasantly surprising you on a different level.",1287878400,7,1270,4.995260663507109

Two lifeless egotists, while suspended in sterile environment, happen to drift past each other and briefly develop an appearance of human relationship, then part ways and continue drifting aimlessly in that lukewarm formaldehyde of a movie. It was nearly as memorable and engaging as watching the movement of two floaters in a broken toilet. The fact that the toilet is very expensive and is located in a foreign country doesn't change the nature of what it is you're looking at.

Bring this plot to a studio and unless your last name is Coppola you'll be lucky if you can pitch it to the security guard without being slapped silly. The photography was great, though.

This film tells the honest story of a lonely man in a troubled marriage - lost in a big noisy metropolis at the top of a big empty hotel. It's perfect - for the way it accurately tells that story. Sofia Coppola succeeds in pulling you inside the hotel and feeling that unique feeling of being away from home - lost. She has a way of pulling the viewer into the emotion of a scene and not letting go - where others may cut away - she makes sure you see those looks, those glances - those moments that we all understand. That is where the strength of this film lies - in its ability to yearn for its characters. I even liked Ana Faris's performance - although she was characterised as a pinheaded actress - the dialogue was so good when there - but not there if it didn't need to be.

Scarlett johansson & Bill Murray's performances are flawless- it's more like improv really - an uncertain but poignant attraction between them that need not go further - and need not display love-making to make its point. I would imagine that they didn't know each other at all at the start of filming - and so it makes the shyness and the banter between them even more attractive.

The only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't continue - but it has to end.

I'm so glad a friend asked me to see this back in 2004, it's one of my favourite films - totally original, unique and personal to the viewer.

1496433,4,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is the sort of movie that viewers either embrace or are bored by its slow, subtle presentation.  It stars Bill Murray in a serious role opposite a young Scarlett Johansson in one of her first movies as an adult, as two strangers adrift in a strange land.

Bob Harris (Murray) is an aging, past his prime actor in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial.  What should have been a simple assignment turns into an extended agony, who is unable to communicate with his intense Japanese director.  Harris suffers from jet-lag and the nagging of a spouse many time zones away.

Charlotte (Johansson) is a young wife accompanying her workaholic photographer husband on assignment.  He has no time for her; she ends hanging around the hotel, bored and also jet-lagged.  She and Harris meet at the bar, strike up a casual acquaintence, and end up exploring the bizarre neon-lit nighttime Tokyo landscape.  Along the way, they learn to cope with their shared exile.  Director Sophia Coppola avoids the easy off-ramps for the relationship; the two keep a certain distance and the ending is subtle, touching, and somehow appropriate.

Not an action movie, and not for the impatient. This is more character driven and setting-location driven rather than plot driven.

This is not one of those movies that is consistently upbeat, ""feel good""; but not a total downer either.  It is entirely believable.

Interesting scenes of modern Tokyo nightlife and and a glimpse of just some Tokyo lifestyles.",1281744000,2,584,5.293478260869565
1496436,2,B00005JMJ4,"When a movie is sparse in humor, action, and storyline it is considered ""character driven"". Critics will always give movies like this one rave reviews. In my opinion they fear being considered unsophisticated if they call the movie what it really is; tedious, unoriginal, and boring.

The ""comedy"" elements tend to fall into the following categories:
1. Japanese people pronounce the ""L"" as ""R"" (Example: ""have a nice fright"". We've seen this bit done to death already right?)
2. Someone says something long and involved in Japanese and the translator reduces it to a sentence or sentence fragment; clearly losing much of the meaning. (also not breaking any new ground here)
3. Hollywood starlets can be so dumb and superficial.
4. The dry wit and charm of Bill Murray (Bob). Example: Charlotte (Johansson) asks Bob (Murray) where her friends are. He says they are taking dancing lessons and gestures towards them. The camera cuts to show them focused on strippers.

I enjoy the dry wit and charm of Bill Murray. He adds to every movie he is in, but this is far from his best work. There are many scenes of the two main characters discussing how bored, isolated, and unhappy they are in Japan. Then after a few tame nights out or at their hotel, Charlotte tells Bob they should never come back to Japan because it would never be as much fun. This line would have worked better if it had been delivered with a sarcastic tone. Two separate scenes of the two of them running out of a building and into the Japanese night are probably supposed to give the film a feel of excitement and energy. It doesn't play and shows a lack of imagination by the writers/director. Worse is the phony sounding phone conversation Bob has with his wife. He sounds like 15 year old as he excitedly tells her about the party he had gone to and the crazy music they were playing. I get it. His new relationship with his soul mate Charlotte has helped him recapture his youthful lust for life.

The larger theme here seems to be that seemingly dissimilar people can learn a lot from each other and form a strong bond when circumstances bring them together. Such themes have been explored in far superior movies (such as ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop""). Most of those movies are probably too structured, entertaining, and geared towards young audiences for critics to heap the same praise on them though.

If this is a movie about personal growth and discovery then it invites the question; ""in what way have the characters grown?"" Bob had an affair on his wife of 25 years with a random woman (not his new soul-mate Charlotte, but a karaoke singer he meets in a bar). Will he realize that he and his wife have grown apart to the point that divorce is the best option, and find a young woman who still has passion for life? Would this be considered growth?

Charlotte has learned much about herself. She prefers the company of a man who is so independently wealthy that he doesn't need to work and can spend the entire day goofing off with her. Will she realize that her husband was never a good match for her and get divorced? Would this be considered growth?

1496438,5,B00005JMJ4,"The opening shot is of Scarlett Johansson, but it's influenced by a painting by John Kacere, whose painting shows up later in the hotel. Actually, it is a shot of a certain portion of Scarlett Johansson's anatomy. Not bare, though. No, that would be gross. Not exactly her torso... lower... lower... there. The other side, now. Flip it over. That's it. Scarlett Johansson was reluctant to film this scene, but Sofia Coppola, the Director, modeled how the shot would look; and then she agreed to do it.

This anecdote has me convinced that Sofia Coppola felt a strong identification with the main character. As a Director Sofia Coppola is willing to go that extra mile. Charlotte IS Sofia; but instead of John (Giovanni Ribisi), the photographer, it was her former husband, Spike Jonze, the director. He directed Cameron Diaz in Being John Malkovich, and perhaps Sofia felt kind of neglected, just like Charlotte--though Coppola denied the connection in an Entertainment Weekly interview.

I know that writers use their own personal experience, and yet they change it, and they are not accountable for any similarity to any persons, living or dead. Especially themselves. But how many thinly veiled autobiographical first novels has the world seen?

So, if Charlotte was Sofia, Kelly (Anna Faris) was Cameron, and John was Spike, who was Bob Harris? Who was the older gentleman that she had the Platonic Affair with? Was it John Malkovich? Really? John Malkovich?

Why then, did she insist on casting Bill Murray, and only Bill Murray? Bill Murray doesn't even have an agent, and if anyone wants to hire him for anything, they have to leave voice mail on a number that he rarely, if ever, even listens to. Sofia left hundreds of messages for him. She flew to Japan to begin filming, and still she hadn't heard back from Murray. If he didn't show up, she was prepared to shut down the production. It most likely wasn't Bill Murray in real life, but Sofia knew that Bill Murray was the only one who could do the part justice. Unless it WAS Malkovich in real life, and she cast Malkovich. But that would blow her cover.

The Japan in Lost in Translation was lost in translation. I think that all the Japanese stuff was merely an extended metaphor for feeling alienated from your environment. Like The Vapors song, Turning Japanese, it was a metaphor for something else. Japan is an interesting backdrop, but I think the movie is really about Bob and Charlotte. Karaoke and the neon lights of Tokyo are an interesting backdrop, but Lost in Translation is not about Japan, per se.

If I can go off on one tangent per review, then I'd like to interject that Sofia Coppola is not David Lynch's daughter, and she did not make Boxing Helena. You take two famous directors with daughters, both trying to break into Hollywood as directors, and it is perfectly understandable that you might get them mixed up. But they are two distinct personalities. So don't blame Boxing Helena, one of, if not THE worst movie ever made, on Sofia Coppola (by the way, does anyone know where I could get a copy of boxing Helena?).

--------------
Bob: Can you keep a secret? I'm trying to organize a prison break. I'm looking for, like, an accomplice. We have to first get out of this bar, then the hotel, then the city, and then the country. Are you in or you out?
Charlotte: I'm in. I'll go pack my stuff.
Bob: I hope that you've had enough to drink. It's going to take courage.
====================

Bob Harris is brilliantly played by Bill Murray, and Bob's interactions with Charlotte/Scarlett are sublime. It is no wonder that Bill Murray was Sofia's choice. Every detail of his character rang true. Frdric Chopin's ""Fantaisie Impromptu"" in C sharp minor, Opus 66 is the ring tone on Bob's cell phone. Murray played well not only with Johansson, but his constant befuddlement with the strange Japanese environment was quite entertaining.

--------------
Bob: I don't want to leave.
Charlotte: So don't. Stay here with me. We'll start a jazz band.
==================

Anna Faris as Kelly was a brilliant caricature of Cameron Diaz. Kelly is ignorant and proud of her ignorance. Cameron Diaz might not really be that thick, but if you were a neglected newlywed, it might seem like Diaz was your nitwitted nemesis, Kelly. Especially if your husband was directing her in Being John Malkovich while you were on the sidelines worrying. Charlotte is bothered by people like Kelly because Charlotte is smart, but she has yet to figure out what to do with her intelligence. Unless she can bring it out in some tangible form she will constantly be upstaged by those with little substance but a more dazzling surface--the Kellies of this world.

For Sofia, the answer was to direct films. That would show Spike Jonze, Cameron Diaz, and most of all, her father, that she had a head on her shoulders. Too bad she had to make Marie Antoinette, and reverse that decision.

The Bottom Line is that Sofia Coppola managed to direct a wonderful film, drawing on her own experience, but translating it into terms we all could understand. She told her story, and it was not Lost in Translation.

Kelly: But listen, let's all go out for a drink sometimes. Yeah?
John: Yeah, yeah.
Kelly: You know, call me, okay?
John: Yeah, okay.
Kelly: Alright. Listen, I'm under Evelyn Waugh. Shh, okay?
Charlotte: [after Kelly leaves] Evelyn Waugh? Evelyn Waugh was a man.
John: Oh, come on, she's nice. What? You know, not everybody went to Yale. It's just a pseudonym, for Christ's sake.

As it is, Bill Murray the actor seems to be bored and on auto-pilot as the movie drags on. He's wry - which is usually good for him, but I found myself just waiting for the film to finish ... then when it did, I couldn't believe that was all there was to it.

The title of the movie is just a ploy to use a clich&eacute; to sell it, and it worked as far as marketing goes. But it has nothing to do with its contents at all and is very misleading. There was no attempt by the American characters to understand anything Japanese, and between the Americans there was nothing to misunderstand. I am at a total loss as to why Bill Murray or the movie was nominated for an Academy Award. I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it.",1275091200,2,888,4.132947976878612

1496550,4,B00005JMJ4,"This is an interesting pitstop in the career of Bill Murray. He is weathered here. Pretty funny, but his melancholy is really restraining the comedy. Which is fine because this film is very somber and simple. At this point in his career, its obvious Bill wants to express his dramatic side and hide his unique and wonderful flair for ocmedy. He radiates dryness, loneliness and discontent in all the right moments. And later pulls out the charm and irreverant irony. Bill deserved an Oscar for this great performance which is romantic, funny and never over-the-top or inapporopriate.

This film is a great companion to Bill's films by director Wes Anderson. It has a definite commercial sensibility. Content-wise, its just a Hollywood film given the ""indie treatment"". Its set in an exotic locale. The dialogue is quiet and sparse. The soundtrack is angsty and ironic. And the humor is pretty much mild slapstick given artsy cinematography. But the subject matter of outsiders and bonding with other loners, is perfect for the arthouse crowd. Its a nice dynamic: their alienation in the colorful Japanese culture and living with the miserable lives they've chosen.

Really for Bill Murray fans. This and his Wes Anderson-directed films are okay films on their own. But Bill lifts them up into great vehicles for his talents.",1266624000,,1324,5.041095890410959
1496551,4,B00005JMJ4,"THere are a lot of things going for this film.  Its grotesque parody of Japanese culture - a true delight to anyone who knows Japan - is without question a bull's-eye:  having lived in Japan, I can say that the place really does at times appear to you the way that it does to the visitors.  Coppola gets Japan, or at least Tokyo, in what I found to be a unique yet tasteful way.  THe chemistry between Murray and Johansson is also extremely believable:  two strangers in their own life crises meet in a hotel and strike up a sudden intimacy, feeling like soulmates is their splendidly luxurious isolation and cultural alienation.  Finally, the acting is positively excellent, particularly Johansson, who comes off as something of a dowdy intellectual, confronted by a stalled marriage and broken identity.  But Murray is great, too, as a film star whose life is moving too fast as his wife pulls away from him while controlling the nest of kids at home.

That being said, the way that some people heap praise on this film as if it were by Bergman goes a bit far.  Sure, they achieve a kind of immediate intimacy and openness, but these things happen when you travel and then they evaporate just as quickly.  But then, this is hollywoodian to its core:  the slightest gestures and exchanges are magnified and become icons to compare to one's own life narrative, a kind of pseudo introspection, almost the way mythology used to supply images to people as they lived their everyday lives.

I would recommend the film as funny and smart, but it is only an excellent comedy and not by any means a bildungsroman or psychological realism, as I had been led to expect from the reviews here.",1265673600,2,1682,4.626262626262626
1496552,4,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray, looking old and wasted, plays Bob Harris, a film actor who has come to Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson is very appealing as Charlotte, the neglected young wife of a photographer. The other star in this film is the city of Tokyo, whose surreal glitz pulses throughout the film and provides a thematic undercurrent.

 It is their alienation from this unreal foreign world that brings Murray and Johansson together in a friendship that approaches romance and ends in sad inevitability when the waning actor leaves Tokyo to return to his own deflated marriage, leaving Johansson to await the return of her insensitive, self-absorbed, preoccupied husband. A leitmotif is the two characters' feelings of emotional estrangement. They are ""lost"" not only because of language and culture barriers but in a deeper sense, their disillusionment with lives that seem to lack the richness they'd expected.

The story is rather thin and the dialogue less than crackles. Charlotte doesn't get very many good lines and has to compensate with a good range of facial expression. Bill Murray's character tries to wax philosophical but it sounds clichd, as when he tells Charlotte that once you have children ""Your life is never the same again."" Charlotte agonizes over her lack of direction: she tried writing but her self-evaluation of her work was that it was terrible (Harris later tells her somberly that she should keep writing).

But director Sofia Coppola makes the most of the materials at hand, and this is a good film in spite of its defects. Murray and Johansson's performances overcome a weak script, and the vignettes of life in Tokyo capture the spirit of a city that one writer has compared to Disneyland.",1262390400,,1737,5.041811846689895
1496553,5,B00005JMJ4,"After watching Lost In Translation I could sum it up as a film about hope. The movie felt so great at the end and it just makes you want to laugh, cry, and perhaps jump for joy.

Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star together in what I would consider one of the best movie about loneliness and hopefulness. Bill Murray played a middle aged actor who is having a midlife crisis and then happen to meet a young, beautiful woman (Scarlett Johansson) who is just starting out with life and really just don't know what lies ahead. To say the least, the two of them are fairly lonely in their trip to Tokyo and question what lies ahead. Murray is on a business trip to make money from sponsors, but he has a wife at home who pays more attention to their children than him. Johansson plays a newly wed wife who is tagging along with her husband on a business trip. She isn't sure what lies ahead in the future of the two, and she is sort of depressed and feels isolated. Together, Johansson and Murray learn something together and both at the end realizes that life has a lot more to offer than what is in a relationship.

I would say the best thing about Lost in Translation is the movie's setting. It is filmed on location in Tokyo, Japan. I never been to Japan, but I have been to Korea and I can relate to the feeling of isolation but as well as a part of the culture there. You can't understand what anyone is saying, nor can you understand the surrounding environment, and to top it off, anyone you happen to meet who speaks English can speak it very well but carrying out an actual decent conversation is next to impossible. I think Lost in Translation captured that very well.

I think what makes this movie so special is the actors who played it out. Scarlett has a very special look to her that I think fit well for this movie. She has a sort of modern beauty to her, but at the same time, you can sort of sense that she is searching for something in life. Bill Murray usually plays an arrogant, stuck up character, but his role in this movie used that to its advantage but also brought about something human in him. You can almost feel a sense of loneliness, confusion, and sort of hopelessness out of his character as he is stuck in a midlife crisis.

The movie ends in what I would consider thought provoking. [spoilers] At the end of the movie, Bill has to return home from Japan and Johansson is sort of sad to see him go, but doesn't really know what to say or how to say goodbye. So they sort of shook hands, said a quick goodbye, and parted. Still not feeling all that great, Bill is in his taxi when he sees Johansson walking amongst the crowd. He tells the driver to stop, and he walks up besides Johansson and they meet again both looking confused as to what to say. Bill then hugs Johansson, and he whispers something to her ear then parts. I think this is quite possibly the best part of the entire film. It sort of makes you wonder what Bill said to Johansson at the end, but at the same time it gives you a bit of hope and inspiration that even though you feel lonely now, and perhaps in what ever relationship you are in, that there is always hope and in that it sort of brings about your purpose, I think. [end spoilers].

With such a brilliant ending, wonderfully thought out actor and actress, and a beautiful setting, I think this movie is one of the best movies of the recent decade. At the end of the film I was feeling great about myself and each time I see this movie, I just think about it for days at a time. I say get this movie!",1262304000,2,3561,4.2463126843657815

1496683,5,B00005JMJ4,"Bob Harris (Bill Murray) arrives in Tokyo nursing killer jetlag and an ever-widening gulf between his personal aspirations and his professional obligations, as well as a marriage succumbing to the laws of entropy; A middle-aged actor of some repute and former stardom, he checks into a luxurious Japanese hotel and girds his loins in order to get through a three day stint starring in a Whiskey commercial for which he is being paid an obscene amount of money.

Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) haunts the corridors of the same hotel, as well as the streets of Tokyo, while her husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), is off photographing obscenely hip bands around Japan for a magazine spread. Recently married, lacking a palpable direction in life and recently transposed to L.A. from New York, Charlotte feels like the proverbial lost soul.

Bob and Charlotte, strangers in a strange land, notice each other, meet and strike up an unlikely acquaintance and this beautifully shot and languidly paced film leaves it up to the audience to decide what really happens next.

Sofia Coppola's ""Lost In Translation"" is hands-down one of my favourite films of all time.

Its about insomnia; jetlag; bad lounge bands; not knowing which dish on the menu is which; drunken nights in karaoke bars with people who have just become your new best friends; strange new cultures; unconsummated passions; the beauty of solitary moments; waking up in a strange new place; the ambiguity of human relationships; the frisson of recognition when you first realise the connection with a kindred spirit and the utter banality of most Hollywood films. It is slowly paced, beautifully crafted, touching in parts, hypnotic in others and is occasionally wince-inducingly funny.

It also boasts a gorgeous soundtrack featuring the likes of Air, Squarepusher, and Mount Sims.

It is also unequivocally 'not' just a ""mid-life crisis"" movie. Or if it is, it's the ""mid-life crisis"" movie that the world deserves.

Its a film that will soothe the soul, lighten the burden, lull you to sleep and leave you wanting to breathe the crisp morning air after a drunken night on the town.",1254182400,3,2139,5.076923076923077

Does he ever drink whiskey and not iced tea? Is the Japanese comedy ever explained? No, no, no, no and no.

I got this movie because it was in the $5 bin, had Bill Murray in it, and some blind/deaf mutant put four stars on the cover. Well I will give it four stars if the scale is 1-100.

The entire movie is like the part of TV shows they play before the opening credits roll. Seriously.

1496685,5,B00005JMJ4,"Pulling up this product to post my review I found myself a little shocked at the very low overall rating this film has received.  148 three-star reviews?  227 two-star reviews?  572 one-star reviews?  Really?  I can't help but wonder how this marvelous film can receive such little love.  Sure, it has 728 five-star reviews (729 if you count mine) but the fact that it has nearly 1,000 mediocre-to-bad ratings is shocking to me, in a bad way.  How could people `not get' this movie?  I think that reviewer Greg Frayser was right; people just `don't get it'.

That is sad, because what Sophia Coppola has done here is create and deliver a touching and poignant look at humanity at its purest, which is something we rarely see today.

A lot of times we see raw and honest portrayals of the dark side of humanity when we look at intelligent cinema.  All too often our own realistic brutality is splashed across the screen, bringing us closer to our very own demons.  I applaud filmmakers brave enough to ascertain the notion that honesty is the best policy, willing to expose us for who we are without a care for the audience reaction.  This pays off extremely well for some, and I have to admit that I have always gravitated towards the darker corners of the cinematic experience.  I feel the need though, especially after seeing all the negative response to this film, to single out Coppola for doing the exact opposite.  Instead of focusing on the parts of us we want to hide from, Coppola exposes the purity that is in most of us; giving us a breath of fresh air in a society fixated on clich&eacute;s and fantastical distortions of reality.  `Lost in Translation' is a beautiful and honest account of two people who, simply put, fill and need within one another.

Both Bob and Charlotte are in a strange place, both literally and figuratively.  They are both in Tokyo, so there's the `literal' strange place, but they are also both in a difficult and confusing emotional state within their own lives.  Bob, an actor, is lost in his own aspirations.  He isn't sure why he does what he does.  He seems almost apathetic, but it's not apathy that is slowly killing him; it's an emptiness he cannot quite understand.  Charlotte, who is traveling with her husband (who is working), is just as lost.  Her marriage is new yet feeling tired and her husband's friends and personality make her feel out of place.  When you are already empty and alone then strange places can feel like prisons as apposed to adventures.  Both Bob and Charlotte find themselves resenting the absurdity of their surroundings because, in their state, everything is void of meaning.

But by chance they meet, and they bond, and soon they find that there is purpose.

Sophia Coppola is a personal favorite of mine.  She has only made three films so far but all three have been extremely thought-provoking and intelligent, and wildly creative.  I love her style, which is unique and visionary.  The word auteur is not thrown around carelessly, but I would toss that word in her direction because she has proven with just three movies to have her own distinct and poignant vision.

And the way she works with actors is a dream!

Bill Murray is a great comedian, one who I adore in nearly everything.  This performance will go down in history as his greatest achievement.  I only wish this had netted him the Oscar (much better than Penn's hammy victory) for his performance is so rich with meaning and depth.  He really understood how to use his unique brand of deadpan humor to create a man who is very real and very personable.  Don't even get me started on Scarlett Johansson's lack of an Oscar nomination here, for in my opinion she gave THE PERFORMANCE OF 2003.  She matches Murray scene for scene, but the natural flourishes she adds to her scenes elevate her slightly above him in my opinion.  Just watch the way she adds a flinch or a chuckle here and there, adding color and individuality to such a beautifully fleshed out character.

There are few films that can reach this level of earnest beauty.  One recent film that comes very close is `Once'.  You walk away feeling this inner warmth and the only word I can use to describe it is `pure'; `Lost in Translation' is very, very pure.",1253145600,5,4261,4.643048128342246

You don't talk about it, to nobody, not even your partner!, and to some extent you don't even think about it...to the extent that it could take days before you *realize* that you are in love...

In a Zen-like-state of mind stillness, your are sometimes to afraid to 'move', fearing that you may destroy that moment.

Trying to describe these moments and feelings is impossible, and the real meaning of these moments and feelings gets lost in translation when you try to put it into words.

Hats off to everyone involved in making this delightful film!",1241568000,2,530,4.53125
1496793,2,B00005JMJ4,"I hold Bill Murray in high regards.  He's simply one of the best comedic actors of the last few generations.  His timing and mannerisms are impeccable.  Similarly, Scarlett Johansson's young career has proven that her talent precedes her, and she's not a bad actress either.  Add in the concept and chemistry between the two, and this should have been a can't-miss movie.  Should have been a movie that actually deserved the praise and recognitions it received.  Instead, it's boring.

The plot is as simple as the movie is boring.  Platonic love between an aging American star (Murray) and a bored, young girlfriend (Johansson) of a Canadian photographer on assignment in Japan.  When the two link up, they test the limits of an audience's attention span while dragging around this corpse of a movie like it's a sequel to Weekend at Bernie's.

Oh, look!  It's Bill bored.  Hey!  It's Scarlett bored!  They're both lonely as well.  Yaaaawn.  Someone needs to hook these two up with an internet connection and a social networking website.  Or better yet, how about a Tokyo tour-guide!?  They're each disconsolate, not to mention lacking curiosity and imagination.  After a few chance encounters at a bar, they morph into pseudo-soulmates - the connection within the movie is never really established.

The plot is underdeveloped at best, and the dialogue is so bad it causes aneurisms.  I think Murray and Johansson did what they could with the script they were given (because the acting is fine), but the writing/directing from Sofia Coppola is pathetic (no way she gets even a nomination if not for her last name).  The pacing of this movie is slightly slower than a glacial drift, and it's nearly as agonizing as being water-boarded.

And before anyone leaves me the comment, I get it.  It's not that complicated.  It's simply uninteresting and undeserving of all the credit.  Somehow, a movie was created which caused my disinterest in not only the classically hilarious Bill Murray, but also the voluptuous vixen Scarlett Johannsen.  Before this movie, I would have thought it as likely as seeing Keanu Reeves hold an Oscar.  Speaking of which...

1496796,3,B00005JMJ4,"How do you tell when you may've watched a 'post-modern' movie? When it's hard to tell anything else about the film.

It's never entirely clear what 2004's Oscar-nominated Lost in Translation - one of Bill Murray's rare ventures into 'serious' acting and Scarlett Johansson's introduction to the Hollywood heavenlies (which wasn't hurt by a 30-second indulgent glimpse of her ample behind right at the film's front) - was trying to get at.

Sure 1) we could say, 'Tokyo', but the city was everywhere yet (because of that?) nowhere. Tokyo is a land which drives Americans crazy, a fantasy-arena where life's details and granularity is hopelessly mixed up in triviality, obsessive formality and technological excess, where empty temples co-exist with crowded strip-joints; then again, who cares? One can't help but feel that Japan the nation was merely the medium for a vague pseudo-message not easily deciphered.

Or 2) was the show merely about a middle-aged man, Bob, struggling through a week of life in Tokyo and who happened to befriend a philosophy-grad, Charlotte, accompanying her husband on a business trip which leaves her feeling imprisoned in a Tokyo-imposed cage of meaningless activity? Yes, except there is no message here, no moral, no plot, no 'solution', no - one could say - point to the two hours of what seems like two people trying to do nothing but cheer each other up. And they do so via parties, with (cheap) philosophy, through one- and two-liners and, most significantly IMO, by staring at each other.

Were these the themes director Sofia Coppola was trying to get at? Staring and quietitude striving to transcend the superficial pauses of an urban chaos which ploughs on and on. Stillness and deliberate thoughtfulness when noise and buzz dominate and when life at home inflicts pain and relational dead-ends (both Bob and Charlotte never seem to end their overseas phone calls happy).

Maybe the whole movie was 3) motion-streaming a strange friendship just to see where things led to on their own. Maybe Coppola didn't know where she wanted the movie to head, and she was waiting for Bob and Charlotte to give her the answer i.e. there was no 'director', the script was 'writing itself'. Regardless, Lost in Translation often felt like it's title, so all ye movie-goers raised on clear story progression, be warned.

4) There are many other questions one may ask although, again, I'm curious if we were meant to ask them. Were Bob and Charlotte falling in love? If so, what exactly was preventing all-out romance, apart from marital fidelity? If not, then was the movie exploring the boundaries of Platonic affection between people who, for all intents and purposes, seemed drawn to each other (and if so, what's the conclusion?)? And why did Bob 'give in' so easily to a total stranger (so much for fidelity) and how did this figure into the movie (since not much was said about it)? What about Charlotte's long silent peerings into temples and gardens? Did those mean something?

5) Perhaps, in the final(?) analysis, Lost in Translation is about friendship - pure but not simple. It's about how friends are made, how a relationship progresses through desire (both sexual and otherwise), how likings and loves adapt, and, ultimately, how we acknowledge the end of a cherished stage (although I'm willing to bet there is no fixed meaning of the final farewell scene; it truly is anybody's guess what the point was, if there was even one).

We've all lived through difficult (but relatively short) phases in life which were redeemed on account of an individual whose presence made the occasion mean something, whose words and companionship redefined the experience from one of repulsion to one of warmth and rightness. Perhaps Coppola meant to depict such quiet relational miracles, the metamorphosis of two 'wrongs' (Bob and Charlotte being in Tokyo) into one 'right' (a week-long mutually supportive memory).

Terrible photography, the ""emulating-a-slightly-drunk-person-with-a-handycam-perspective"" really gets annoying after a while.

Should a movie be scaled on how much blood, boobs and Ka-Booms can fit in 100 min, or how much we can think, ponder, or symbolism. If you weigh your opinion based on the first choice, LiT is about the farthest you can get from entertainment, if you happen to favor the latter, then LiT isen't gold, it's darn-near movie platinum. But if you appreciate both, like me, and want a healthy balance of both, LiT is like a fat-girl with a beautiful personality. If it was in a prettier, flashier body, it'd be your number one pick.

 Symbolism, especially in movies, is a double-edged sword, and when it comes to it, most people have a destinct mark of love or hate. LiT is considered a modern masterpeice when it comes to allegories, it has deep themes concerning alienination, culture shock and finding yourself, and all are vibrant throughout. The movie fills it's reel by showing a more serious Bill Murray and the ever so talented Scarlett Johansson exploring these themes so beautifully, meekly and passionatly that it does make you wonder how this could get any better... or if it can put you to sleep faster than NyQuil can. If you think of figurative language less as an art and more as BS, then you would see LiT as two average, boring people living their average boring lives, and we get to see them live it for 100 min. If symbolism isen't your cup of tea, steer far away from what is potentialy a snore-fest.

 When it comes to me and my tastes, I need a little of both sides. I can't be fully satisfied with disecting what seems to be an average person's life looking for what the deeper meaning of it all is, but I can't take a straight shoot 'em up movie with a cast full of Jesse Ventura's.",1230768000,,1823,4.368731563421829
1496898,4,B00005JMJ4,"For all the acclaim Sofia Coppola's film LOST IN TRANSLATION won upon its release in 2003, I didn't expect the film to have much staying power. For one, upon every viewing one gets increasing peturbed by its treatment of the Japanese, among whom washed-up American actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and recent college graduate Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves. Bob is in town to film a whiskey commercial, while Charlotte accompanies her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi), who swiftly leaves her alone in her hotel while he goes off to a shoot. Bob, experiencing a midlife crisis, finds company with Charlotte, who is experiencing her own uncertainties the future of her marriage and her ability to establish a career. Together they survive their week among an alien culture with an immense language barrier. Are Coppola's jokes about the Japanese (l/r confusion in phrases like ""lip my stockings"") adequate ways of expressing Bob and Charlotte's difficulties, or are they just cheap shots? Should we condemn Bob and Charlotte for making so little effort to adapt to their surrounding society, or should we empathize with their difficulties? The cultural issues surrounding LOST IN TRANSLATION might be perennial.

But as I saw this film yet again recently, I find it very thought-provoking, and that certainly makes it stand out among Hollywood productions of these times. As Bob enjoys a night out on the town courtesy of Charlotte, hitting the bars and then going to an after-party in some flat where he smokes up and sings karaoke, we wonder about the possibility of regaining lost youth. When Bob ultimately kisses Charlotte at the close of the film, we are led to question whether merely platonic friendships of the sort they had established earlier can really last. And certainly, regardless of its occasional depiction of Tokyo dwellers as weird, the film does inspire a great desire to visit Japan and see it for oneself. The visuals of LOST IN TRANSLATION are occasionally so lovely that they leave the plot behind.

The film is also has Bill Murray's best performance of his post-GROUNDHOG DAY period, where he became an expert at depicting jadedness. Here this air of being total disinterested in his surroundings is tempered by a warm humanity. Johansson's acting, on the other hand, may be the film's weakest aspect. Regrettably, her presence in the film works only when she is basically just an object, which Coppola often uses her as (the opening shot is of her pantied buttocks as she lies in bed).",1230163200,3,2531,5.052631578947368

I'm not talking about finding someone to have sex with, just mere companionship. If you are at a convention, then you have a greater chance of meeting like-minded individuals.

And Sofia Coppola, showing her immensely skill at direction, manages to impart an appreciation of the noble beauty of loneliness which lingers after the credits have finished rolling.

Well, that's what the film Lost In Translation is- it's not a bad film, nor nearly as good as its reputation proclaims, but it is unlike just about any other Hollywood or indie film to come down the pike in the last few decades.
  That it was nominated for and won a screenwriting Oscar for director Sofia Coppola is just plain silly since the film's resonance and character creation comes from its visual images, not its too spare writing. An aging, former American film star named Bob Harris (Bill Murray) comes to Tokyo to film an ad for a brand of scotch. Like many American film stars in real life who refuse such stateside, lest oddly believe they'll dampen their credibility as actors, he accepts the enormous sum the Japanese sponsors offer him- $2 million- for a week or so's work. There he meets the Gen Y wife of a hip young photographer named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). They have little in common save their shared loneliness and insomnia when Charlotte's husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) goes off for a few days on a shoot. Charlotte is a typically aimless young soul who peripatetically bounces between wanting to write or photograph, & seeking an outlet for her philosophy degree from Yale, while Bob is a lethargic middle aged man who's not so much in crisis mode as he is in ennui to the cosmos.... Still, as stated, the movie's visuals are its real charm- the scenes of Tokyo's night life, neon, the odd angles that Charlotte looks down upon life from in her hotel room, and especially a beautifully filmed, yet hauntingly lonely shot of Bob playing golf in the foreground of Mount Fuji, add almost enough poetic resonance to the characters that the script lacks to pull off a viewer's belief in their romance. Sofia's brother made a far superior film a few years ago that dealt with many of the same themes of alienation. CQ, for whatever reasons, did not seem to strike a chord the way Lost In Translation did.

I understand it may not appeal to everyone, but it's flat out ignorant to deem this as a poor effort or production. It's anything but.

Is it perfect? Of course not. But it wholly fulfills what it sets out to do and is a fantastic effort from Ms. Coppola.

People may complain that the storyline or plot of this film is thin, but its simplicity is part of its charm. The aesthetics of this film alone make it worth seeing. If you never had an inkling to go to Japan, this film may change that. Coppola's vision of Tokyo and in essence, her ""strangers in a strange land"" angle, is strong and prevalent from beginning to end.

Bill Murray's performance is outstanding, as well as refreshing. His dry wit and comedy sense permeates throughout much of the film. Scarlett Johansson is also convincing and well portrayed.

The cinematography is amazing, and for me, very much part of the film's appeal. I was also thrilled with the ending. Overall, I just enjoyed WATCHING this film. A must see for any fan of Murray or Johansson, as well as those drawn to films centering around human relationship dynamics.

I found myself relating to the film's characters on multiple levels and therein lies its strength - capturing the truest thoughts and questions of people as they move through life, but never tries too hard or reaches in order to drive a point home.

1497025,5,B00005JMJ4,"I guess this is one of those ""love it or hate it"" movies, so all I
can do is tell you why I love it so much. First, filming the
movie in Japan was not only a way to capture the two main
characters out of their element (which was the brilliant, central
point of the film), but it took ME out of MY element, which was
refreshing. I loved the nightlife, the colorful characters, the
strange looking food, the cherry blossoms in the gardens...
the setting for the film was magnificent.

As for the two main leads, the acting is superb. Bill Murray
takes a huge leap playing an aging, burned out actor with marital
woes and hits the mark, dead on. Scarlett Johansson approaches
the youthful object of  his affection with understated sweetness
and grace. Neither  actor overplays or underplays their part, which
is rare in film. Both are spot on.

And for the story. How refreshing to explore the complexity of
male/female bonding without resorting to raunchy sex scenes
and offensive language. Maybe the reason why so many
viewers are disappointed in this film is because of its quiet,
thoughtful, deeply tender approach to the subject matter. There's
no fast cars or nudity in this film; just the story of two lost souls
completely out of their element who find each other and reawaken
in each other something both of them thought they had lost.

At the end of the movie, as the Jesus and Mary Chain song plays and
the two part ways, I always get teary-eyed. If someone can tell me
what the two whisper to each other, I'd really like to know. But then
again, maybe that would be giving too much away in this brilliant gem
of a film. Highly recommended for those in search of a lighthearted
and tender romance that doesn't follow traditional rules of ""love""
constructions in cinema. Brava Sophia!",1214956800,5,1791,4.584375
1497026,3,B00005JMJ4,"It is fascinating the love/hate opinion most have for this movie. It garners either five stars or one star and yet I find myself somewhere in the middle. Director Sophia Coppola breezes us through Japan, be it to witness the traditional wedding in Kyoto, dashing through the Pachinko parlors, singing karaoke, walking through shrines and temples, eating in local restaurants, riding the trains, the shabu shabu restaurant, the propaganda vans shouting their messages as they drive down the street, the ladies handing out tissue packages on the street, the often bizarre Japanese tv shows, and so, so much, this movie is at times a loving home movie for me, reminding me of so much I have seen and done during my time in Japan. For that reason alone I find myself watching it now and again just to remind me of the country that I miss so much now that I am back in the states.
Many people have complained of the anti-Japanese sentiment. I think they are missing the point, however. The two characters, Bob in particular, are very real clichs of the ugly American. Rather than taking Coppola to task for making fun of Japanese people, I give her credit for showing us ourselves. The squeamishness and outrage we feel when we see these characters is purposeful. Lord knows I came across many such people in my years there and seeing this behavior in the characters made them very real to me. Furthermore, Bob's acidic attitude is symptomatic of the misery and sadness he is experiencing and the frustration that stems from such feelings which causes him to seek the most convenient scapegoats for his angst.
In the end, though, most of the complaints stem from the viewers being bored to death and I will agree that there is little that really happens in this movie. It reminds me in some ways of ""Sideways,"" both character studies where we visit with flawed and problematic people. I will also admit that before I lived in Japan I watched this movie and it wasn't nearly the same experience as it was after seeing Japan in person. It changed so much of my understanding and appreciation of the film.
One of the things that did bug me some was the near perverse nature of the relationship. Charlotte is young enough to be his daughter and their wavering feelings of longing for each other didn't serve the plot in any real way. The tenderness and humanity of the film could've been accomplished with a more realistic father-daughter connection between the two. I understand that they are desperate and needy for anyone to give them some shelter from their misery. But again, I think that this point could've been made without the sexual tension. Being lonely, being sad, and needing someone to cling to during difficult times in our life need not be sexual.
There is a scene about two-thirds through the movie where the two characters exchange thoughts on life, mostly Bob dispensing wisdom to Charlotte. This is my favorite part because we see the crystallization of what these two mean to each other. After days and nights suffering through jet lag, these two sleep-deprived foreigners finally fall blissfully asleep because at last they realize they are not alone amid the neon chaos of Tokyo. Charlotte nestles close in the security of her new friend and Bob gently touches Charlotte's foot and anchors himself for that moment to allow sleep to come. It's a subtle and tender moment and there are enough of these moments in Lost in Translation for me to forgive some of the mistakes. This is not a perfect movie but I give Coppola a lot of credit for making this most unusual and off-beat film.",1212278400,2,3595,4.735247208931419

Bob Harris (Bill Murray) an actor whose prime is behind him travels to Tokyo to endorse a whiskey for a sizable payday as well as to take a break from his home and married life. Bob struggles with what may be a mid life crisis and seems to mentally struggle with the emptiness and life questions that it brings on...

Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) a recent graduate from Yale with a philosophy major and a recent newlywed has traveled to Tokyo with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) who is a celebrity photographer. John's work consumes him and as he travels all over Japan he leaves Charlotte in Tokyo and a feeling of neglect begins to set in. Charlotte has achieved all of her early goals of finishing school and getting married but she still doesn't really know who she is or what she wants. A disconnect begins to form between the intellectual Charlotte and the work driven John and his banal, self centered celebrity friends. Charlotte isn't sure where life is taking her and can't seem to find direction ...

Charlotte and Bob meet and find a kindred spirit in one another and an unlikely friendship is formed...

This was a great movie but is not going to be for everyone. ""Lost In Translation"" is a character driven movie and is not driven by a typical A to B plot. It is about watching each of the characters deal with their own emotional ups and downs and as a viewer you will either find a connection with what's happening on screen or be left thinking it was pretentious and wondering what it was all about.

The Good: It was great to see Bill Murray take on something that is a little outside of his norm and succeed at it and a great performance by Scarlett Johansson as well. Anna Farris also has a small part in ""Lost"" as an actress who has just filmed a Matrix like movie and she nails her part and gives an excellent performance.

This was great writing and directing by Sofia Coopola. The scenes and the way they were shot were great at letting the audience know what was going on with the characters.

The score was perfect and with the combination of great directing and acting the emotions of the characters and their internal struggles were excellently conveyed.

The Bad: Nothing memorable.

Overall: ""Lost In Translation"" is definitely not for everyone. Don't look for steamy love scenes or action packed fights and don't come looking for slap stick comedy. ""Lost In Translation"" is a character driven movie about people in a living purgatory looking for something or someone that will lead them out. If that sounds interesting then pick this up and give it a try.",1210982400,10,2654,4.629787234042553
1497028,4,B00005JMJ4,"Movie Review:  Lost in Translation
 Directed by Sofia Coppola, Lost in Translation brings the audience into the fantastic city of Tokyo, Japan.  This film consumes the audience in an aura of neon lights, karaoke bars, metropolis adventures, loneliness, soul-searching, and that the connections that we make in life may not last, but are never forgotten.  Shot on location, in just 27 days, Lost in Translation presents a simple but beautiful story with fantastic performances by Scarlett Johansen and Bill Murray, stunning cinematography, and powerful messages presented to the audience.
 Murray plays Bob Harris, an aging American actor who is in Tokyo to do a Japanese Whiskey commercial for big bucks, instead of maintaining his status on the artistic role call or spending time with his family.  It is immediately apparent that Bob is confused and essentially lost in his life not knowing what he should do.  He eventually meets and befriends the youthful Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansen who is staying in the same luxury hotel as Harris.  Charlotte is a young, lovelorn, newlywed, tagging along to Tokyo with her neurotic Photographer husband.  Even before Charlotte's workaholic husband essentially abandons her; it is apparent that Charlotte is also in a soul searching transitional state, stifled by a lack of direction in her life.  Both Charlotte and Bob seem physically and emotionally isolated from their spouses and find themselves reflecting on their lives and where they are headed.  The mutual soul searching and insomnia eventually drive the two into meeting each other.  The chance encounters between Charlotte and Harris eventually blossom into a surprising friendship, with powerful camaraderie.  The audience then follows the pair on their chaotic yet beautiful adventures throughout the city of Tokyo and the hilarious encounters with its citizens.  From being shot with automatic pellet guns, running through the Tokyo metropolis, to late night karaoke in high rises, Lost in Translation truly depicts the craziness and beauty of the city.  Bob and Charlotte discover this magnificence and the meaningfulness behind loving friendships.
 The journey brings excitement to the lives of Charlotte and Harris and the two ultimately discover a new belief in life's possibilities.  Inevitably, the fairy-tale journey has to end and Harris and Charlotte have to part ways.  The film ends on a controversial and graceful note which again exemplifies the theme of living in the moment and making the most of the attachments we form while we can.  While the ending may burn some people, film lovers will forever adore its mystery and bittersweet quality.
  The performances of Murray and Johanssen are both equally terrific.  Until recent years, when most people think of a Bill Murray movie, thoughts of Caddyshack, Groundhog's Day, Stripes, and classic SNL hi-jinks immediately come to mind.  Although these films are not considered groundbreaking, Murray has truly proven himself to be a comedic genius.  Aside from his underrated yet profound performance of Hunter S. Thompson in Where the Buffalo Roam, Lost in Translation marks the beginning of Murray's transition into more dramatic roles.  Throughout the film, Murray does an incredible job of portraying a man who is truly lost in his life and not knowing where to turn.  On the surface it seems that he should be content.  He has a family, success as an actor, and large amounts of wealth.  However, he is able to portray a man who is completely alone, distraught, and reflecting on his life with no feeling of accomplishment.  He does this so well that the audience can't help but feel his sorrow.  At the same time, he is able to combine these feelings of loneliness with his world renowned humor in a very subtle manner.
 Johannsen's performance is equally ground-breaking and compliments Murray's character very well.  Her role as a confused young woman still discovering herself takes the audience back to any point in their lives when they felt the same way.  The chemistry that develops between the two on screen is just as humorous as it is beautiful.  Charlotte and Bob are able to laugh at the people and situations they find themselves in and laugh at each other.  This coupled with their natural dialogue allows the audience to relate to each of the characters very well.
 Several messages can be taken away from this film.  One is the idea of inspiring friendships, and that the connections that we make in our lives may not last, but are never forgotten.  This of course comes through in the relationship that Harris and Charlotte form.  Although they only spend a week together, the bond that they form is incredibly strong.  The love and deep feelings that Charlotte and Harris feel for each other is handled smartly and romantically, because the two know that they live in a real world with real consequences.  This highlights the subtle theme of bittersweet loneliness that is present throughout the film, which seems to challenge the audience by forcing them to reflect on their hopelessly lonely moments.  What started out as a surprising friendship develops into a deep, beautiful love story and the way in which the two discover they're soul mates will be cherished in the film world for years to come.
 The idea of being lost and searching for something is another one of the prominent themes in this film.  Although they are at different stages in their lives, Bob and Charlotte are lost and searching for something in their lives.  By finding each other and sharing the experience they seem to rediscover themselves and realize the beauty of living in the moment.  At one point, Bob makes the statement that he's lost and realizes he wants to live healthier and take better care of himself.  This film is by no means preaching about health and being physically fit, but just the fact that life is beautiful and we should try and live it the best we can.  Having the movie take place in a foreign land seems to make it somewhat easier for the two main characters to see this.  Being in Tokyo, and being exposed to a different culture helps Bob and Charlotte live in the moment, and forces them to take a step back and put things into perspective.
 Overall, I found Lost in Translation a positively terrific film with several elements all coming together in perfect harmony.  After watching this movie, I had many conflicting emotions.  For one of the first times in my life, I felt sad and happy simultaneously.  I was overcome with a feeling of sorrow and grief, but also a feeling of inspiration that I couldn't really describe.  From examining the nature of close friendships, to showing the fascinating and chaotic aspects of another culture, to someone's own personal soul search, there are many things that one can take away from this film.",1210809600,3,6849,5.008841732979664

1497031,1,B00005JMJ4,"I join at least 550 other Amazon reviewers who found this movie boring and somewhat offensive. In outline, the concept is not bad - two strangers who meet in a strange country, feeling alientated - but the execution leaves much to be desired.

It's clear that Sofia Coppola has gone to the European School of Prententious Filmmaking, where ""art"" is supposedly conveyed by long, empty silences and people staring impassively at the camera. The vapid Ms. Johansson, with her painfully unformed and Nordic impassivity, fits the bill to a T. The problem is when these ""meaningful silences"" aren't really meaningful. Rather than ""art"", Coppola's scenes of silence tell me she ran out of things to say.

It's also clear how Coppola regards people who aren't European. Making fun of Japanese people, lampooning them in this film, really put me off. The comic bits of the film derives solely from Bill Murray doing a whisky commercial over and over. The point of this comedy is: ""Aren't Japanese people funny? Aren't they weird and bizarre?""

No, they're human beings. Tolerance and trying to understand another culture (and failing) isn't the point of the film - rather, it's about how justified two spoiled and vapid people feel about being alienated. The film would have been far more interesting if Murray and Johnasson had tried to communicate with the foreign culture around them, and failed. But in Coppola's film, they don't even bother trying. The characters are only there for the money (in Murray's case) or because they've been dumped there (Johnasson). Japan is a fascinating country, but you'd never know it watching this film.

Instead of ""Lost in Translation,"" Coppola should have called it ""Lost in Themselves.""",1206403200,7,1720,5.045774647887324
1497032,5,B00005JMJ4,"Are you someone who likes curling up with a book on a rainy day, listening to the sound of the rain in your quiet apartment, completely immersed in the text?

You will love Lost in Translation.

Like others have said, this is not the kind of movie you watch with your friends for a laugh. It's something you have to let yourself get lost in, and let yourself believe. There isn't a car chase or a sex scene, and this movie isn't going to fight to keep you interested (like some other movies in theaters which appeal to an ADHD generation).

But get some alone time, go to a quiet space, and forget everything and everyone as you slowly sink into this beautifully crafted film.

Interestingly enough, though this movie is in English, it reminded me of two foreign flicks- Amelie and Pan's Labyrinth.",1206316800,6,798,4.520833333333333

1497133,4,B00005JMJ4,"I just saw ""Lost in Translation"" for the first time today and I was impressed.  However, in view of the many super-negative reviews, I should clearly state that the movie came together in the final minute or two.  Had I not watched it to the end, I would not have has as positive reaction.  Indeed, the bulk of this movie is sheer boredom.  The writer and director want us to experience being in a lonely place (and boy do they suceed!).

Haven't you ever spent a week one day, or a month one week, or a day one hour in a place where you just didn't fit in?  Whether it be at the height of your career or as a child in a room full of adults, there is a real sense of loneliness when you realize that you are truly and profoundly all alone in a crowd; no one to relate to, nothing to entertain you, nothing to distract you, and you don't have the power to get up and leave; you're stuck!  I know that I can think of a number of times that has happened to me and there is a lonliness and sadness unique to such an experience.  Now think of similar settings on whose several occassions, there WAS someone who, for that otherwise interminable moment in time, was someone who made the experience turn into an manageable one.  It wasn't any ""love at first sight"" experience, it wasn't a ""let's exchange phone numbers"" (or even just Christmas cards) experience, and certainly not a ""let's do this again"" experience.  It was a place you never should have been but with someone who made the experience bearable.  That's what I saw in ""Lost in Translation"".  Moments like that come and then they are gone.  ""Lost in Translation"" is a tribute to all the misplaced persons who found each other briefly and then moved on.  It is a beautiful movie with exactly the right ending.  Share the boredom but share the blessing as well.",1205020800,5,1815,4.3601190476190474

I went to see this movie with HIGH expectations, based on the HIGH amount of hype (and of course, to see Bill Murray, who rarely missteps in even the most miserable product), and went away scratching my head wondering why everyone is praising this film as if it's the second coming of Kane.

Lost in Translation is deadly dull, it overdoes the typical Japanese stereotypes, and it completely squanders the talents of Murray as well as Scarlett Johansson. Apparently Coppola had to really chase after Murray to get him to do this film. He should have shut off his phone.

Lost in Translation comes off as a big-budget student film.

The movie earns its single star only for Murray's Joey Bishop imitation.

1497139,2,B00005JMJ4,"Coppola's film does a good job of capturing a mood: one of melancholy and wistfulness. And the soundtrack (more than anything else) solidifies this sometimes hypnotic and intoxicating mood. However, that is not enough to sustain a movie -- a music video, maybe, but a movie, no. The two characters of Bob and Charlotte, while sympathetic to the extent that they are strangers lost in a strange land coping with their emotions, are nothing more than two world-ignorant Americans who should never have ventured out their front doors. Gee, the Japanese (living in Japan!) don't speak English very well. That is not insightful. Instead, it is a rather sad commentary on how hopelessly vain and narrow-minded some Americans are when dealing with other cultures. By focusing on the one-dimensional stereotypes of how weird and un-American Japan can be, Coppola allows her protagonists to take the fool's approach. Bob and Charlotte spend half their time holed up in their hotel room and the hotel bar, wallowing in their disillusionment with life. Had they really been brave, they would have used the opportunity to explore the country and culture they came so far to get to. And in the process of this discovery, they very likely would have come to a better and deeper understanding about the country, and ultimately about themselves and where they're going.",1201219200,5,1353,5.044642857142857
1497140,4,B00005JMJ4,"Sadly, prior to buying this HD-DVD, I have never viewed this movie before.

It is a movie I have been wanting to see, but never got around to watching, until just now.

And wow, this is a beautiful movie, the chemistry between the 2 leads is amazing, Bill Murray plays this wonderful character, he is in a different culture, doesn't know what he is doing, and just enjoys, and embraces whats happening.  It is a really great movie, I never expected to enjoy this as much as I did.

The hd-dvd has a few features (a 30 minute behind the scenes, which is ok), and a 10 minute interview with Bill Murray and The writer / director.  This is a great interview, and I really wish this movie had an audio commentary or (even better) an IME.

The video quality left me wanting more, it never really shines, it isn't really sharp, I really cant see this looking that good.  It's about the quality of broadcast television on HD, but without the nice sharp contrast, deep blacks, and sharp details.  Then again, this movie doesn't really need it.

So for an HD-DVD I give it a 3 (out of 5) because of the video quality

Extras I give a 3 (really good interview, and a nice behind the scenes, plus some other cool extras), sadly no commentary. (but we do get some deleted scenes, one or two that really shine)

The movie I give a 5 out of 5.  I will gladly watch this movie again, I just really love this movie, I cant say exactly why, but you do fall in love with the characters, the situations, the atmosphere, it's just really special, you should see it.

I hope one day, they will re-release this wonderful movie, and remaster the video and add an audio commentary from the writer / director, Sofia Coppola.",1200441600,3,1699,4.372611464968153

I'm telling ya that Tokyo is a dead city which is constantly dying even further, but Fukuoka is much more international, cosmopolitan place and people are happier and less cold there. Yokohama(Kannai and Minato Mirai 21) is underrated too.

Basically, I didn't understand this film. Even though I do understand that this movie is about culture shock. I suppose that what kept me from enjoying this film is, whether intended or unintended, emphasis on strangeness and weirdness, even to the eyes of most of the Japanese.

Which are... the leg-wiggling Tokyo prostitute shouting ""lip my stocking! oh! oh!..."" etc... and the old man sitting on a lined up chair, pointing at the air, moving his finger around, around, and around....
you know, not all Japanese are like that.

About the imagery... at first I thought it was like a cheap home-movie. But when I watched it the second time, I saw some elegance

I am deeply compassionate about the loneliness of Bill Murray, but somehow not of Sophia. I don't know why... She was listening to this self-help CD even though she is not from any west coast hippie towns in the United States... hmmm, strange. Oh well.

In conversations in this film. I find a lot of intelligence and elegance, and (only) some snobbishness which I like (I mean it.) So I give this movie another star.",1199836800,3,1445,4.783132530120482

Finally, I had a quiet few moments, an opportunity presented itself and I decided to give it a shot.

I can understand the mixed reviews. If you are expecting a movie that ties up any sort of loose ends or follows a plot, you aren't going to like it. If you are expecting Bill Murray to be hilarious, you might want to look into one of his classic films. Looking for pure entertainment and story? You probably won't enjoy the movie.

This is a piece that reveals those icky insecurities and quirks that we all carry and transfer to our relationships. Any human interactions are subject to our own filters and life is a series of our interacting filters meshing or rejecting, not unlike differing languages and customs. All the details of life are subject to translation or interpretation and exactly what the movie is about -- the miscommunication small and large that guide us, govern us and control us.

The characters are lost, emotionally, as they try to figure out what they are looking for in life, in careers, in the bottom of booze bottles and in other people. Several reviews mentioned feeling depressed after watching the film. Possible, but depends on whether or not you are in that cycle -- the search without knowing what you search for.

Great acting. Deep characterization. Interesting theme. A study of humanity in all its complexity. Looking for pure, simple entertainment? Look elsewhere.",1196035200,5,1559,4.7380073800738005

True, there are good points, some jokes, and Johansson is photogenic. The direction is competent, the setting is arresting and seldom used, so all the power to Coppola, but as cool as Murray is supposed to be, I thought his antics tiresome. The inability of Japanese to speak English is funny once, maybe twice, but at a certain point, maybe the third or fourth time, I began to think it was boring and then offensive. The acting is good and the story isn't bad. We understand the boredom and isolation they are going through, we sympathize, I think, because the set up is well-done. She's been left alone by an unloving husband; he's not missed at home and feels unwanted and unneeded. Still, the Japan setting while it works gets old fast because there are no insights, no perceptive observations, really nothing. It is merely an exploited backdrop to a narcissist's breakdown. Everything gets old fast, because as good as the acting is, it cannot hide the absence of a story.  Japan has been the next great thing now for thirty years. It is time for someone daring to really look at the society and expose it for what it is, instead of presenting it once again as a gag.",1195862400,3,1326,4.61864406779661

Then I couldn't stop thinking about it. I bought it before I watched it a second time, somehow sure that I would watch it again and again.

And I was right. I can't describe it--this movie is like therapy for me. I put it on when I'm by myself, going to sleep, early in the morning, or whatever.

1497237,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is one of Bill Murray's finest performances on film.

Whoever made the decision to shoot in Tokyo (the Director's, one can only assume), it was a brilliant choice. No city in the world can compete with Tokyo in terms of nighttime lights and the fresh sparkly cleanliness of its streets. Add in the language barrier, the Japanese, their cuisine, great photography, great direction, great acting, and finally, a terrific script, and you have a masterpiece.

Lost In Translation truly makes you feel lost---lost in time really. Sofia Coppola's use of the clock while filming native scenes accompanied only with ambient noise is a mighty tool of provoking deep thought in the viewer. Truly it must take guts to consume precious film with such shots, else more directors would utilize the method.

No two better suited individuals than Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson could have been lobbied to fulfill the lead roles. Murray has like, somehow, escalated multiple levels here in connecting with an audience. Maybe he had it inside of him all along, I don't know. Regardless, I am nearly brought to tears watching him. Here's a fellow who is nearly 60 years old, and yet, the most amazing inner talent is just now being revealed to us. What a treasure.

Ms. Johansson plays the perfect newlywed here---being left alone in a strange city by a self-absorbed husband who doesn't appreciate what he has. Charlotte and the middle-aged Bob Harris (Johannsson and Murray) happen to fall into each other's path at one of those cosmic moments of doubt when both are unhappy with their home life.

The gold brick of this entire encounter is cast when they appear together lying on a bed. It must be seen and heard to believe; it is one of the finest performances of its kind ever filmed IMO---Hence the subject line of this review. If you do not connect with this scene, then you are either unable or have yet to experience such a moment in time. It is the height of goodness that a human could possibly feel in such a place.

1497328,4,B00005JMJ4,"In most movies we see today, a director shows the movie's characters (whether proactively or reactively) moving the plot forward in such a way that the audience knows at least as much, (usually more,) about what's going on then the characters do.  The thing that makes this movie so fascinating (and to many people, frustrating) is that the characters start off knowing WAYY more about what's going on than you do, and you have to spend most of the movie trying to ""catch up"" by learning about who they are.

Moreover, the director has no plans to make it any easier for you to get to know these people than you would be able to if you met them in real life.  It becomes clear as you move through the movie that they are no more likely to expose the deep, dark secrets of their lives to you, the audience, than they would to strangers in a foreign country (even though this absurdity is what we, as the audience, have been conditioned by Hollywood to expect!)  As such, you cannot understand the story of this movie as merely a passive observer, waiting for an explanation to present itself.

So what's a movie watcher to do?  Well, this is the hard part: in order to get to know them, you have to pay close attention to what's NOT happening between the characters; what seems to be missing, or left unsaid?  Unless you invest in this exercise, you won't recognize the exquisite tension between the two protagonists as it builds to the movie's climax, and you will likely watch the credits feeling bored and maybe frustrated.  However, those who can engage with the impromptu couple emotionally will feel the intensity and depth of the director's vision.

1497329,5,B00005JMJ4,"I must say, the first time I watched this movie, I hated it.  My husband and I had rented it for the night and were expecting a film that moved along a little more quickly.  After all, don't most films do that these days?  It's unusual to have a film that unfolds slowly and deliberately, and if you're not in the right mood for that kind of movie at that moment, you're going to hate it.  I hated this movie (with a passion) the first time I saw it.  My husband and I rolled our eyes at each other when it was done, as if saying, ""Can we get those 2 hours back?!""

The next time this movie was on the movie channel, I watched it again.  I began to appreciate the actors' performances, as well as the glimpses into the culture of Tokyo.

The unspoken romantic feelings between Bob and Charlotte are wonderful, and it was refreshing to have a movie that convincingly portrayed a bond between two characters without having them rip their clothes off.  We can see that they're attracted to each other, but they also know that they have other obligations.  Heartbreaking, but beautiful.",1185580800,6,1082,4.41919191919192

1497336,4,B00005JMJ4,"Loneliness is one of the most basic human emotions; when experiencing it, some people will reach out to others who understand that feeling. That sentiment seems to be at the heart of ""Lost in Translation,"" a film that straddles the line between odd love story and a look at loneliness and isolation.

Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a middle-aged actor with a faded career. Currently he's alone in Japan, filming a commercial, and feels lonely and alienated despite the luxurious surroundings and royal treatment. He catches glimpses of a pretty young blonde, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who intrigues him.

She is equally bored and lonely, and at loose ends since her husband is away working. The two finally meet over drinks, and begin to bond and explore the city of Tokyo. Bob is in a downtempo midlife crisis, while Charlotte is unsure what to do with her life. And they both learn that they have things to teach one another...

A small warning: ""Lost in Translation"" has very little plot. And yes, it can be pretentious at times, sometimes politically incorrect. Fortunately, Sofia Coppola's second full-length film has qualities to make up for its improvised plot, with the beautiful cinematography, good direction and outstanding acting by its two main leads. It's a movie that requires patience and slow unfolding.

Loneliness is the theme of this movie. Particularly, it's the loneliness of the soul -- Charlotte and Bob are surrounded by people, yet they feel alone. Hanging out together alleviates their loneliness for a little while, even though their problems won't go away. As a result, some parts of it can feel hollow. But at the same time, it gives the film a more realistic feeling -- often people in such situations DON'T deal with it.

In keeping with the theme, Coppola keeps the movie slow and pensive, with plenty of beautiful cinematography and exquisite shots of Tokyo. The entire film has a slightly shadowy, glowing look. And the quiet dialogue has a witty, acerbic edge, such as when dizzy blonde Kelly announces ""I'm under Evelyn Waugh,"" only to have Charlotte inform her that, ""Evelyn Waugh was a man.""

Bill Murray rules this film, with his understated expressions and world-weary attitude. It's surprising that someone could act so blase, and yet be strangely charming. Scarlett Johansson proves that she is no longer just another child star, with a solid performance that stacks up well beside veteran Murray's.

Strange, slow and pensive, this is a film that takes some getting used to; it may even take multiple viewings to fully ""get."" Just soak it in, and see how you like it.",1180915200,9,2614,4.954337899543379

1497427,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is a movie that took time to grow on me. It doesn't move quickly, but it is full of depth and that shines through with every viewing. With vivid often surrealistic imagery and sharp witty dialog the film manages to entertain you while telling the real story.

  I find most love stories to be trite, formulaic, and self-indulgent. This is far from that.  What kind of love do our protagonists feel? They never sleep together, although they both wanted too. Bob even cheats on his wife with another woman but still doesn't sleep with Charlotte who he has fallen in love with.

  That part of the story gives their love purity and validity. They marketed the movie as a story of friendship, but that is a lie. They love each other in a very real way, but they can't express it.

  Both are married, the elder in a marriage of 25 years with children, the younger a newlywed trying to maintain a strained marriage. It is that unrequited love that makes it so beautiful. They love each other and are spending time with each other but they don't have each other.

  Most of the time unrequited love is one way. A man is obssessed with a woman who doesn't return his feelings or maybe maybe even dislikes the man. This love is a far more tragic love. A love that stays in one place, one moment.

  Watching the film you wish they could stay in Japan. We all have moments in our lives like that. A month, week, day, or hour that we wish we could freeze ourselves in. Outside that moment means nothing, no worries of the moments past or future. Just you and that moment trapped in happiness. Maybe thats heaven.

1497429,5,B00005JMJ4,"Having watched Lost in Translation several times now, I am guessing that this is Sophia Coppola's own coming of age story, with her telling it now as the screenwriter and director.  She grew up around the movie business thanks to papa Coppola so Hollywood and films and celebrityville stuff does not awe her one bit.  She probably had a similar experience to the one Scarlett Johansen has in this film - she hooked up for a little while with a big male star.  She got pulled into his orbit and for the span of time it takes to shoot a film she and he connected, gave each other some comfort, and then irrevocably moved on to their separate universes.  Al Pacino's orbit?  Andy Garcia's?  Young Sophia got a chance to get inside big movie star's brain - and what he thinks is that it's all a bunch of BS, but the money and the women are nice.  Essentially, life is life whether you're rich and famous or whatever.  You still have to eat, sleep, find something to do with your time, deal with hassles, scratch your elbow, try to stay connected with people, and get through the day.

She is sort of stuck in the hotel in a culture very different from her own, not knowing language. Bill Murray is a famous actor in Japan with a advertising sponsor, shooting commercials, etc. He has been married 20 plus years. Appears to be in a period of marriage where they are going in different directions. Busy with kids, work, etc. He has alot of down time in Japan also. Doesn't understand the culture or language.

They strike up a friendship. Nothing physical involved. They enjoy each other's company, they both appear to want more, but realize it's probably never going to happen.

The chemistry between Bob and Scarlett is credible despite the difference of ages.

1497434,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is a dreamy, mellow film that relies almost exclusively on visuals and music to get it's points across. The minimal dialouge sprinkled throughout is rarely as important as the images unfolding on the screen. The pace moves at a gloomy crawl, a few instances of tasteful comedy keeping the mood from becoming too heavy(it should be noted that Billy is mostly poking fun at himself, not the Japanese people.)  The two main characters are kept apart for most of film, with Sophia wisely choosing to dwell on them when their alone both literally and metaphorically; this intrusion of their privacy allowing the viewer to really submerge themselves in the characters'lives for better or for worst. As Bob and Charlotte cross paths more and more fequently the movie builds with understated urgency, until the film springs to life midway through when they finally come together for a night on the town in a fast paced sequence of fun colorful adventures.

The film is never this lively or hopeful again, as the final moments gradually develop a painful almost dread quality to them as Bob and Charlotte are faced with the realization that this retreat from their misery can't last forever.  Oddly enough, the moving conclusion ends up being a bittersweet triumph, hinting at a new found strength in the characters.  Sophia  makes good use of both the actors and the beautiful urban setting while showing an excellent understanding for almost pure visual storytelling.  Tokyo simply looks beautiful as she allows the camera to drone on the lovely details of the city and it's citizens; mostly through the eyes of an aimlessly wandering Charlotte. After watching the film, one feels as if they know the city and the hotel as well as the characters.  However, it's really the performances that carry the film.

Bill and Scarlett prove to be more than up to the task of almost wordless acting.  Though his weathered face is mostly somber and blank, Bill's soulful eyes stare with a profound unrest and longing, the slightest gesture conveying pages of depth and emotion that probably wasn't in the script. A very mature Scarlett does much of her acting with subtle looks of vaguely masked dis-satisfaction and desperate unrest; often appearing to be completely helpless and vunerable to the depression she's sunk into.  Her and Bill's characters might as well be the same age as both seem to be feeling the same thing.  When they do interact, the scenes are filled with incredibly sincere subtle gestures that reflect warm fondness and understanding if not an all out unspoken attraction. It's this geniune warmth that makes the film so romantic and the earlier melancholy all the more worthwhile.  In his small role, Ribisi is also enjoyable as Scarlett's well meaning but clueless husband. Some find it difficult to empathize with the characters and the irony of their situation(apparently rich and depressed), yet anyone who's ever felt alone(see: everybody) should not have trouble relating.

DVD Notes-A short featurette with Sophia and Bill is the most useful and watchable. There is sadly no commentary, and the deleted scenes add nothing, while the Music Video is kind of meh. The menu screen is beautiful however.",1171411200,7,3233,5.020560747663551
1497435,5,B00005JMJ4,"Some films don't need to be great for traditional reasons.
This is one of those films.

One of the most magical things about this film is how Tokyo shines brightly throughout the film.  The dialogue, the music, everything moves slowly at a deliberate pace. The viewer is able to really take in the city that surrounds the characters. Sofia's Coppola direction almost seems delicate. Much of the soundtrack underscores the precise rhythms of the city. The dialogue between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson accent the visual tapestry like remembering a dream, half phrases, knowing looks and whispered tones.

Lost In Translation  gives a fleeting glimpse into an intriguing city and its very interesting world.

Highly recommended.

1497564,5,B00005JMJ4,"*** Slight spoiler at the end of this review ***

The acting and directing in this movie are remarkable.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson very convincingly portray two lonely souls who meet each other in the bar of an upscale hotel in the middle of ultra fast-paced Tokyo.

The acting is quite subtle with so many wonderful facial expressions used by both actors to communicate feelings to the audience.  The characters become real.  This is, perhaps in large part, due to the audience's ability to easily see Murray as that aging, cynical movie star who grudgingly travels to Japan to make a healthy sum of money starring in a Japanese whiskey commercial.  His brilliant, comedic talent is used sparingly, yet very effectively in several, low-key, yet hilarious scenes.

Roger Ebert beautifully describes the final scene of the movie (in his September 2003 review):
""I loved the moment near the end when Bob runs after Charlotte and says something in her ear, and we're not allowed to hear it.  We shouldn't be allowed to hear it. It's between them, and by this point in the movie, they've become real enough to deserve their privacy. Maybe he gave her his phone number. Or said he loved her. Or said she was a good person. Or thanked her. Or whispered, ""Had we but world enough, and time..."" and left her to look up the rest of it. """,1169769600,4,1338,4.663829787234042
1497565,2,B00005JMJ4,"The subject of two lonely people, one man, one woman, having a chance encounter that blossoms into something more, is quite a common one for movies, books and TV shows.  This half-comedic take on it adds the twist of a foreign setting, Tokyo, Japan.  The man is Bob, an aging TV star flown into Japan to shoot a drink commercial.  The woman is Charlotte, a newlywed tagging along with her husband.  Charlotte and Bob meet each other by accident in a bar, and form a friendship while meandering thru the daylife and nightlife of Tokyo.  Both are married, yet neither is happy in their marriage.  Neither is willing to betray their marriage, so the movie is an extended play on foreplay and flirtation.

I found this movie to be quite boring.  Bill Murray does seem past his prime, especially as a comedian, in this movie.  The dialogue between the two is realistic enough, though not that engaging.  And for a movie set in Tokyo, they could have used more famous sights as settings for different scenes.  Instead, much of the movie takes place in their hotel, or in malls, or restaurants, or other places that are quite similiar between the US and Japan.  The only worthy cinematography was the scene where they witness a Japanese couple on their wedding day.  Outside of that, the only memorable scene was Charlotte introduction, a shot of her butt in see-thru underwear to begin the movie.  How appropriate, seeing that Scarlett Johansson is one of Hollywood's new bombshells.  Otherwise, I was as distracted watching this movie as the two characters were in their stays in Japan.",1169769600,,1581,4.761029411764706
1497566,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation stars Bill Murray as Bob Harris, a middle-aged American actor in Tokyo for a week to shoot commercials for a brand of whiskey sold in Japan.  The film also stars Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte, the American wife of an American photographer who has tagged along with her husband on his business trip to Tokyo.  Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this movie and it was beautifully filmed by Lance Acord.

The film is about two people in a alien culture connecting in a way that they would never have connected back in the States.  If you've ever been to Asia on a business trip, this film captures perfectly the overwhelming off-kilter sense that an American feels in large Asian cities.  Superficially, they are made out of the same elements, concrete, bricks, glass, pavement, and the structures are similar, tall buildings, streets, sidewalks, cars.  But everything is just slightly different and some things are enormously different.  I had to laugh when Bill Murray came out of the hotel and onto the street and saw a van driving down the street with two Japanese women dressed like Jackie Onasis waving to onlookers as another woman exhorted the crowds in Japanese over a loudspeaker.  I've seen similar things myself in Taiwan and probably had the same confused expression on my face as Bill Murray did.  When you are immersed in a different culture, you can often run across things that are just baffling.  Sofia Coppola captures that feeling perfectly.

And it's in this strange world that Bob meets Charlotte.  Both married, but both bored and somewhat overwhelmed by their surroundings.  In America, they'd hardly glance at each other, because Bob is 20 years older than Charlotte, and they really have very little in common.  But in Tokyo, compared to everyone else they run across, they have a lot in common.  So they connect, they talk, they start hanging out together, they explore a little of Tokyo together.  And at the end of the movie, Bob flies back to the States, and Charlotte awaits her husband's return from a two day side trip to Kyoto.  Both of them gained a lot from the experience and both of them have changed, for the better.  Kind of a bittersweet ending because you get the feeling they'll never see each other again.

This is really a wonderful, engrossing film though.  It is marvelously well written and directed.  Bill Murray is perfect as the slightly bewildered American in the strange world of Tokyo advertising.  Scarlett Johansson is extraordinary as the twenty-something young wife with a philosophy degree wondering about her future.  The rest of the cast fills in the edges well, and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.

Bill has a chance encounter with Charlotte (Scarlett Johannsen), a young, recent college grad who has made the trip to Tokyo with her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi), and totally feels like a fish out of water.

Bill and Charlotte become traveling companions and friends, exchanging their opinions and anxieties about life and love.  Charlotte doesn't know what to do with her life, after graduating from Yale, with a degree in philosophy and doesn't know who she married.  Bill is in a pretty loveless marriage to his wife, who is devoting the main focus of her life to raising their children, and who only calls him to nag.

Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte a 22 year old, recent Yale grad whose hipster, photographer husband is too self-absorbed to provide real companionship. Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a fifty-something, has-been actor who has traveled to Japan to earn $2 million making liquor commercial.

When the two meet in the hotel's lounge, they find more than a pleasant conversation.  In each other they find the kind of companionship and kindred spirit their own marriages lack.  Though their relationship is strictly platonic, it provides the intimacy, respect and genuine love that each craves.

Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, LOST IN TRANSLATION is a magically atmospheric film that completely transforms the bright lights and excitement of a hectic, world-class Asian city.  Here in the bath of neon lights, Coppola delivers the black and white world of psychological struggles, generation gaps and genuine unrequited love.

Though I recognize that this is an odd comparison, LOST IN TRANSLATION reminds me of James Joyce's short story ""The Dead.""  Both are like Polaroid's of a memory.  They invite the viewer into a quiet, subtle, seemingly fleeting experience that will undoubtedly have explosive consequences.

It was then that everything makes sense and I realized that Lost in Translation is such a special film.",1168387200,,511,4.389473684210526
1497663,4,B00005JMJ4,"I read a few of the reviews already given for this movie. Those who are young, who have a lot of life yet to experienc will not identify with the main character of this movie. The movie will seem to flow slowly with no real interest other than the sort of fast life protrayed in the city of Tokyo.

In actual fact, if one is about the age of Bill Murray, one can identify with his character and find a lot more meaning in this movie. The movie then flows, it is interesting, it has more meaning.

I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wanted more from the movie. Murray very well protrayed his frustration, his lonliness in life with his eyes, his expressions, his demeanor. I felt that if he had talked with Charlotte more, talked about his life vs hers - why did he feel ennui, feel lonely, out of touch even in a crowed room. This greater interplay might have made this movie more intesting to people of all ages.

There were many touching moments in this movie. When Murray carried Charlotte to bed after their first foray into Tokyo, you could tell she felt ""safe"" in his arms, as if she was in her father's arms. It was a very touching scene to me. Murray was caught between his role as a father and his growing love for her. He opted for the role as father, which said a lot for his character. There were two types of love there for all to see - a father's love for a daughter, and a man's love for a woman. Both were there at the same time.

Later they were in bed together discussing a lot of issues. He tried to help her see life in a positive way and he helped her. Now at this point it would have been appropriate for him to be more open with her to discuss his life, it would have been a more powerful moment. I believe just a few minutes of dialogue would have sufficed at this point to create a greater frission that was already developed between these two lost people. At this end of this scene the audience is given a view of her lying next to him, her feet pressed against his leg. His right hand moves from beside him to touch her feet. It was a touching moment. Here again the father/daughter/potential lovers dual relationship is even more evident. Once more his role as father wins over the supposedly normal ""male takes what is offered"" role. He knows who he is, and this knowledge is what creates his lonliness.

The scene in which he has taken the red-headed singer to bed, after they met the previous night in the bar, and then Charlotte knocks on his door the following morning, encountering the fact that he has had company for the night, detracts somewhat from the love that was growing between these disparate people. Yet this defines that the weakness was always there, the need to exorcise lonliness, but it was not done with Charlotte. This too is telling of his character.

The final moment, the tender goodbye was the best moment. He finally kisses her, and he kisses her on the lips, then on the cheek. You can almost feel the younger man inside him has come out and replaced the older face, the older arms and hands, the older body for just a moment. He was there, this younger person. Then he said goodbye, for unlike what the younger male might have and could have done, the older mind in the young male kept his place, kept things as they could only have turned out.

Hearts can reach out from another place and give love. This happens every day when we go to work after we say goodbye in the morning to the wife and kids. They are with us all day. Then too, I believe that hearts can reach out from another time and give love. It is a sadder love, but love nonetheless.

Strangely I liked all of those other movies, but this one was boring. It looks pretty and the performances are okay, but not enough happens, it is not romantic and it is most certainly not funny.

People keep speaking of all these cute social observations as if they require a meticulous or intelligent mind to capture or something.

I mean hello? It is no longer observationally witty to realize that the Japanese are short, have bizarre television shows and run American sit-coms with weird voiceovers. It is not much of a revelation that a person would be lonely in a strange land with different languages and customs.

This is not wit or subtlety. It is unfunny and boring.

1497666,1,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation--the whole movie must have been lost in translation for me. The first thing I said to my husband at the end of the movie was, ""Did we get a defective DVD?"" Because I saw none of the intelligent dialogue that everyone raved about.

I should say that, as a stay at home mom of three young children, I don't exactly require the wit of the Algonquin Round Table to entertain me. But even still, I found Lost in Translation's occasional attempts at witty repartee and observations about life trite and flat. This is like a very long, very bad Seinfeld episode--a movie about nothing, but without the humor, either. Or much of a dialogue at all, for that matter. Or even a plot. I struggled to keep awake for Lost in Translation, and I wasn't even tired when we started watching it. The *only* scene in the entire movie I enjoyed was where Bill Murray was filming the commercial with a Japanese director who speaks no English. ""Are you *sure* that's all he said?"" Hilarious. The rest of the movie was a crushing bore.

I felt no affinity with, or affection for, the characters. They were self-pitying, self-absorbed people who could find nothing better to do in the fascinating city of Tokyo than to hang out in hotel bars and the occasional club with someone else's spouse and have boring, sporadic conversations about nothing in particular. Every other character in the movie is dismally one-dimensional, and the portrayal of the Japanese people in it comes dangerously close to racial stereotyping. I was offended for the Japanese, and I'm not Asian. I thought at first my Japanease sister in law from Tokyo might enjoy seeing the movie, but after watching it, the racism was blatant enough that I would've been embarassed to recommend it to her.

Lost in Translation was about as interesting, funny and exciting as overhearing someone else's cell phone conversation about the most mundane minutiae of their life. I'd rather watch a two hour Teletubbies marathon than sit through Lost in Translation again.",1164067200,16,2023,4.807471264367816

1497669,4,B00005JMJ4,"I have seen many reviews about Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation. Some called it fantastic, beautiful, unforgettable, a masterpiece... Others called it boring, lost and a forgettable film. When I saw the film for the first time myself I was thrilled by the feeling it gave me, it grabbed me for sure. But still I could understand both sides: this film touches you or doesn't effect you at all.

The story, written by Sofia Coppola herself (which she won an Academy Award for), is a story that follows two totally different persones. First there is Bob, an actor who comes to Tokyo to film a commercial for a brand of wiskey. Secondly there is Charlotte, the wife of a workaholic who just travelled along with her husband. Now these two characters both have their own problems fitting in the gigantic city's way of life and basically feel lost. When they meet each other on a night at the local hotel bar, a friendship develops and they decide to explore Tokyo together.

Now this story leaves you either cold or touches you deep inside.
The way the story is filmed is simple but very effective. The camerawork is fantastic and the locations are wonderful. Tokyo is a colourful background that gives the film certain lighting and most of all: atmosphere. This element makes the film extremely powerful. It is like Coppola said herself: she wants you to feel like you have been in Tokyo after watching the film. The atmosphere definitely makes it feel like that. It makes you feel like you are right there walking  next to the characters which is a very effective way to tell a story. Now the people who disliked the film probably had problems keeping their attention with the film because they couldn't feel that atmosphere or simply disliked it because there basically doesn't happen very much.

The actors, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson, both give fantastic performances. Bill Murray is absolutely funny and does a great job portraying his character. You see exactly how he feels about something without him saying anything: the expressions on his face say it all.
Scarlett Johanson also does a great job and brings, together with Murray, the film to life. The chemistry is perfect between the two which gives fantastic scenes.

Lost in translation is a film without any action, without tense situations, without special effects: it simply shows a week of two people their lives who try to escape boredom in a place where there is difficulty to understand each other. If you are looking for a film with explosions, fights, thrills etc, you have to look some place else then Lost in Translation. But do you love dramas, atmospheric films with some humour sprayed on top of it: Lost in Translation is a film for you to see. After watching it for a second time you will see that there is so much you didn't see the first time while watching the film. It definitely grows on you.

Sofia Coppola has proved that you don't need a lot to make a great film. With simple but very effective storytelling she has made an absolutely delicious atmospheric film that is a must-see for sure.
One of the best atmospheric films I have ever seen.",1162166400,5,3135,4.7221206581352835
1497670,5,B00005JMJ4,"In her second film, 'Lost in Translation', Sofia Copolla displays her astounding screenwriting capabilities. Capabilities that will hopefully be developed and explored further in the future. Where much of 'Lost in Translation''s beauty comes from is the knowledge of where to allow silences between the characters. This is not a film that is cluttered with unnecessary dialogue, but instead allows silent bonds to develop between the characters, as well as emotions that are unexpressable through conventional speech.

Although never truely spoken or discussed, the silent desperation of Charlotte and Bob is palpable. These are two people who, despite their differing lifestyles, are equally lost, alone and desperate for someone who understands them. This is what gives the film its tragic beauty. Within this script it would have been all too easy to fall into the 'mid-life crisis' cliches, however these are deftly avoided.

It is not just the scriptwriting that is remarkable in this film. The preformances by both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are pitch perfect in what was an outstanding piece of casting. Each of them more than deserving at least an Oscar nomination.

Ultimately 'Lost in Translation' is a masterclass in subtlety, unspoken anguish and unfulfilled affection. In one word, beautiful.",1161561600,4,1313,5.426470588235294
1497795,5,B00005JMJ4,"I have seen this moving many times, and each time I discover new elements.  The two main characters Bob (Murray)  & Charlotte (Johannson) are traveling in Tokyo and having difficulty finding their place both in life and the unique culture that they are currently immersed in.  They are both highly intelligent, and I believe they truly appreciate the beauty of the Japanese culture, however, they feel bewildered that it does not seem to affect them in any meaningful way.  When they meet, they form an unexpected bond, which basically is the entire movie.  The relationship that emerges is really beautiful with elements of romance, admiration, restraint and even a sense of parental concern.  All these elements are subtly and fabulously woven into the performances by Murray and Johannson.  I love the scene when they fall asleep in the same bed while talking.  As Bob (Murray) doses off, he reaches out and puts his hand on her foot as she is curled up sleeping.  Very subtle, but very powerful.  My absolute favorite scene, however, is the very last scene as Bob says goodbye to Charlotte on the street.  Their embrace is so touching, and I LOVE the fact that we can't understand what he whispers to her.  It is as though they see in each other a part of themselves and together, they don't feel so ""lost."" What they have in Tokyo, however, would probably be lost back home or somewhere else.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone.  I really think that this is one of those movies that you really just love, or don't.  I happen to love it!",1160697600,2,1551,4.692592592592592
1497796,5,B00005JMJ4,"I've watched this film many times, and it never ceases to impress me. Much has been said about the Western actors in this film, but I want to comment on the Japanese side where the actors also do a magnificent job.  Their portrayals fit seemlessly into the heady milieu of this story. It amazed me the way the film immerses the viewer into the Tokyo scene so realistically, giving one the sense of cultural vertigo. After living in Japan for more than 10 years, I can attest this story uncannily captures the feeling, the sights and the sounds of a foreigner's experience in Japan.

I would also like to add that Sofia Coppola seems to have managed to do something few Western artists could ever hope to do by conveying the character and humor of Tokyo with a story rooted in the Japanese perspective. The restrained romance between Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansen reflects the style of great Japanese literature. While this film is a comedy, its central story is of a fleeting relationship immersed in a sensory whirlwind which is very much akin to the stories and novels of, for instance, Noble laureate Yasunari Kawabata. It is the classic cherry blossom theme, and the symbolism in the film is enough to establish that fact. Coppola has woven the texture of beauty and sadness, of love and fleeting happiness, into the fabric of the film as a Japanese novelist would have. One cannot help wondering how she acquired such a deep feeling for Japanese society at such a young age. Her artistic powers of observation and imagination are proved in this film.

The comedy is almost a separate story from the central love interest and springs from the natural friction one encounters in a totally foreign society. The genius of this film is that Coppola displays what is funny to both sides of the cultural gap. My Japanese father-in-law, normally a humorless salary-man type who rarely smiles, burst out laughing most uncharacteristically when he watched this movie. Rarely does humor cross the boundary between English and Japanese, as almost always the important things really are lost in translation. Coppola manages to bridge that gap with hilarious effect.

I'm in complete agreement with the other reviewers who have praised this film, only adding that Coppola has done more than create a comedic and romantic masterpiece---she actually manages to do it in a Japanese way.",1159747200,5,2377,4.890818858560794

However, I found the ending terrible, and much more could have been done with the very interesting characters she built up. I would have gladly sat through another half hour if the characters came to some new plataeu or deeper understanding of themselves. Overall the film is worth seeing, but I'll not be watching again.",1158019200,2,598,4.99
1497798,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is my (all-time) favorite movie. With so many sad movies about sexual exploitation floating around, it's a refresher to see two nice, interesting people exchange such powerful, passionate, platonic gifts during a brief, innocent time, without taking advantage of or hurting one another, and leaving one another happier and stronger.

Sofia Coppola's complex, beautiful, diverse sensibilities drench each frame with implications... revelations... perturbations.... Like all perfect movies, this one is rich, deep, lavishly-textured, and gorgeously-layered. Coppola adds not a questionable jot nor extraneous tittle, and leaves out nothing necessary to her narrative or contemplation. She attends masterfully to imagery, editing, framing, character, dialogue, tension, narrative, symbol, improvisation, serendipity...a small sampling of her range of talents, may she live long and prosper in the movie-making business.

I lived for a few childhood years in Tokyo during the American post-war occupation, and took away beautiful, evanescent impressions, so perhaps I'm more susceptible to the delights of this movie than your typical movie-goer. Watching Lost in Translation, I'm enchanted both by remembered charms and recent technological innovations, as well as by the awkward Japanese embrace of things western.

Lost in Translation is perfectly titled, because Copolla shines her tragicomic vision on the challenges each of us, no matter how talented or well-intentioned, face in communicating, caring, and empathizing across the mile-high/-wide/-deep chasm of human individual differences. Copolla's laser gaze scintillates not only cultural barriers such as language and custom, but universal obstacles as well--differences in gender, age, social class, lifestyle, goals, values, interests, backgrounds, personalities--and even the molehills and mountains of distance and time.

Lost in Translation is hilarious, even more-so for Japanophiles. I've seen it many times, and still am cajoled into explosive snorts. Like any great lover, Copolla brings knowledge, appreciation, honesty, and a creative, playful intimacy to the peculiar amusements and benefits of relating to the Japanese. Japanese culture has its many endearing and frustrating quirks, as do all cultures; Copolla chooses to laugh equally good-naturedly and respectfully at eastern and western pecadilloes.

I cannot imagine a soundtrack more thoughtfully selected or edited in support of the shifting impressions, emotions, and experiences Coppola develops in each new scene.

Bill Murray's unique talents are all on glorious display, as are Scarlett Johannsen's equally bounteous ones, which have an umplumbable feel to them. She defiantly withholds an illusive, precious, sensuous little secret--like Garbo's, like Monroe's--whose unveiling the world will breathlessly await forever. Casting Johannsen, like casting Gwyneth Paltrow, will elevate any movie. Only great direction can account for the consistent quality of all the other ""smaller"" performances.

The fact that anyone could enjoy this movie on the level of a simple, poignant, romantic comedy should not detract from its value as a multifaceted meditation upon the human challenges inherent in connecting with any ""other""--whether in ""translating"" one's self to another, or in meaningfully ""translating"" another's mysterious mumblings and gestures in our own direction. Far too often, we are left feeling all alone in the world throughout most of our lives, feeling quite ""lost in translation.""",1157846400,5,3547,5.9980237154150196
1497799,4,B00005JMJ4,"Sorry previous reviewer, I neither loved nor hated this film. And reaching a resolution to the question, will they or won't they, is forward plot movement. This film goes expertly well to a place.

But this film could easily be called ""My Weekend with Bill Murray"" because the ""Bill Murray"" presence was much too strong--or should I say--is much too strong to be contained within this mostly serious, independently constructed character. The well-established Bill Murray persona overwhelmed the Bob Harris character. This was not Bill Murray's performance of a lifetime as many reviewers have said. He was very good in this film as a mellowed Bill Murray, but ""Groundhog Day"" was Bill Murray's performance of a lifetime so far, followed by his part in ""Caddyshack.""  Those are the parts that closely fit Bill Murray. This Bob Harris character who's a big action movie star who's hired to glamorize Suntory and who's so attractive to all the women (well, at least the white women) who pass him by?--come on, that's not Bill Murray and it makes no sense putting him into such a character. Mel Gibson or Wesley Snipes, maybe, but Bill Murray and all his gaunt looks and sardonic humor? Bill Murray in this part doesn't ring true at all for me, especially since he's still doing his usual shtick, although a very subdued, chastened version of it mixed in with dramatic acting. There's still the familiar SNL comic mixed into this Bob Harris.

And then the fact that this supposedly major American movie star, whose face is plastered on billboards, can walk all around Tokyo in all his fame and tallness and not get recognized and swamped by any of the Japanese on the streets or in the restaurants? Ridiculous. Where are all the teenage Japanese schoolgirls huddled on the side and pointing and giggling? Where are the paparazzi? Either you break down and call this film what it essentially is-- an underwritten Bill Murray film--or you concede that it was miscast and in many ways makes no sense. And then on top of everything else, they make his relationship with his wife on the phone so one-dimensional with she so cold and he so obviously jilted. What an easy setup.

So it sounds like I disliked the film? Nope, I really liked it and recommend it.  It was a nice diversion, very different in its way, and had an interestingly delicate relationship as its subject. This is another movie which is obviously a finely tuned collaboration of many cinematic artists and Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray list a few of them in their interview in the Bonus Features on the DVD. It was a fun, successful depiction of Tokyo and some of its zany culture. The relationship between Bob Harris and Charlotte was different than the standard romance, and there's always a question of whether it's a true romance or not. I can't help thinking it was, in essence, more a father-daughter relationship and the real message of this film is, it's ok to let go of Daddy. Bill Murray in this film, as the sardonic Bill Murray, has the quality that gay men stereotypically have in many stories about confused women--he's safe to talk to and hang out with, and in this film, as a much older man, he is at times, almost more like a doting father, or teacher, or older brother, but definitely, at all times safe. The dialogue was too sparse. You'd think someone who just graduated with a degree in philosophy would have more intelligent, or at least, more intellectual things to say. She's pretty lightweight, all in all. Just a grown kid, newly woman, with a funk.

So that's it, a somewhat fun film which is, like someone previously characterized it, quite underwhelming, but well worth watching. No one can doubt that Sofia Coppola will get better and better as she gets more practice as a filmmaker and will probably adds some real greats to the cinematic heritage. Maybe she first needs to get past her Daddy. Sorry, that wasn't meant to sound mean. It just came obviously to mind in my armchair psychologist brain while watching this film.

One thing strange, the R rating is only because of one short scene in a strip joint which could easily have been edited out or redone to PG standards. I guess they really wanted that R rating. Explain that.

And yes, as someone earlier pointed out, the lack of now-standard viewer controls with this DVD is really annoying. Don't keep pushing the ""DVD menu"" button, it won't work. But it's a good movie despite all the above. Enjoy.",1157500800,,4449,4.731612903225806
1497800,5,B00005JMJ4,"Everyone with whom I've ever discussed Lost In Translation has either loved or hated it. This is not a movie you can take lightly, one way or the other. To figure out if you'll enjoy this film, ask yourself the following questions:

1. Do you like Bill Murray as an actor?

2. Do you like Scarlett Johansson as an actress?

3. Do you like chick flicks?

4. Do you have a high tolerance - even a liking - for movies that are character driven instead of plot driven, i.e. the movie consists primarily of a series of neat character bits with very little forward momentum to the plot?

If, like me, you can answer yes to all of the above, you'll probably love this movie. If you answered no to any of them, probably not.

Bill Murray is Bob Harris, middle-aged movie actor and former star of a Seventies private eye TV show. Bob is in Japan, where his show is still amazingly popular, to film a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, in her early 20s. Charlotte is in Japan accompanying a neglectful photographer husband more interested in partying with the beautiful people than spending any time at all with his wife. (And does this man not have eyes? You want ""beautiful people""? Does he not realize his wife looks exactly like Scarlett Johansson?)

Bob and Charlotte find themselves guests in the same impersonal hotel, isolated in a country where neither speak the language, both in unfulfilling marriages that, from what we see and hear on-screen, just might not be lasting too terribly much longer. And yet they both take their marriage vows seriously. This is the story of how two people, with absolutely no sexuality at all, still fall deeply, mutually in love, and how they deal with that.

Some people feel the end of Lost In Translation is a total copout. If you like your movies tied up in little bows with everything explained, all the Is dotted and Ts crossed, you're going to hate how this film ends.

They strike up a friendship that grows as the film progresses.  His marriage, while not exactly on the ""rocks"" seems to be very tepid.  When he calls home, she never has time to talk to him, and the kids don't want to be bothered either. The young woman is more or less ignored by her husband, too.  Should they have an affair?

1497804,3,B00005JMJ4,"Though the film is slightly overrated, even those who hated Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" would admit it has four great things. As so many reviewers have posted their opinions (and more than 1,800 people, which is amazing, considering that the film is not a summer-season blockbuster), I won't repeat the story. And though the film received Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, the script is not the most impressive part of the film.

1) Great acting of Bill Murray, who deservedly got Oscar nomination. His portrait as Bob, a has-been in Hollywood who came to Japan to shoot a commercial for a whisky company, is amusing and touching at the same time with subtle touch of pathos. He does not say much about himself, but you can feel the emptiness of his life.

2) Great acting of Scarlett Johansson, who is also impressive as Charlotte. She embodies the feeling of someone who is `lost,' who knows she should not be here, but cannot leave. The chemistry between Charlotte and Bob is so natural that at first sight it looks as if the actors are not acting at all. (And don't forget Anna Faris who gives an amusing cameo as B-action star).

3) Great photography by Lance Acord whose camera exactly shows how the city of Tokyo would look like. The camera captures the vivid images of Shinjuku and Shibuya, two of the major downtowns of the city. Though the film contains a brief sequence in Kyoto - Nanzenji (Nanzen Temple) district and Heian Jingu (Heian Shrine) - that looks like beautifully printed postcard, the cinematography of `Lost in Translation' is most impressive when it introduces us the chaos of the metropolis seen through the eye of Bob and Charlotte. The scenery seen from a hotel window in Shinjuku, or the crowded streets in Shibuya are exactly what you will find in Tokyo.

4) Great soundtrack music. Just listen.

There are so many flaws in `Lost in Translation': lengthy karaoke sequence should be cut short; a strange Japanese woman who confuses the English pronunciation of `R' and `L' only proves that humor is not Sofia Coppola's strongest point; and Giovanni Ribisi's role is nothing but a cipher. The film looks as if drawn out beyond its limit.

See the film for two great acting, photography, and the music. You may not like the rest of the film, but they are genuinely fantastic.",1153353600,3,2347,4.768472906403941

For all the awards and nominations that the film received....it's probably interesting to point out that, there was a large percentage of money-paying cinema (and DVD) viewers, for whom the film completely missed the mark.  So in retrospect....having seen the film several times, since it was originally released in Cinemas back in 2003.  But I've gone back very recently to watch the film...and see if it still stands up, several years later.

Most will be familiar with the story of fading movie star ""Bob Harris"" (Bill Murray), whose lured to Japan against his better judgement, by a very lucrative promotion for a Japanese Whiskey.  With a marriage that is merely `going through the motions', and his character going through something of a small mid-life Crisis...What initially seems as a temporary escape from the question marks regarding his life, for him...morph into a lonely figure trapped in the hotel, of a foreign country....unable to fall asleep at night.

The other Character is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a woman who having recently finished a Yale Graduation, and still finding her feet within a 2 years marriage to her Photographer husband.  Decides...after having nothing else to do, fly to Japan, with her husband....who is commissioned to be the photographer for a Japanese rock band.  Charlotte having being left to her own devices, due to her husband's daytime photography commitments....grows gradually more bored and distracted, by generally being relegated to spending the majority of her time in the hotel, and she also has yet been unable to sleep in the evenings.

What happens of the course of the 94mins, is nothing more that two people...who wouldn't have meet under normal circumstances, find a uneven common ground, and embark on a gradual appreciation and developing friendship, through the loneliness of their environment.  For Charlotte.....Bob represents a complicated, yet intriguing character, from which she admires and then gradually begins to not only identify, but affectionately warm to.  And for Bob....Charlotte reminds him of his the earlier years in his marriage before the complications of a lack of communication and Children entered into the equation.  In short, simpler happier times.

One of the main criticisms, that friends who haven't liked the film have citied, is the lack of anything truly substantial happening throughout the film.  But arguably that is ultimately the point.  It's a absorbing look at how two initially disparate characters, connect not only verbally, but emotionally as well, first through the loneliness of their environment, and then striking up an unlikely friendship and strong affection for each other.  It's  a perfectly stylised illustration how sometimes meeting certain people at the right place and right time, can and does, have to power to completely change or alter the individuals perceptions.  And although the relationship between the two characters remains platonic, there remains a strong unspoken sexual undercurrent in their friendship, that ultimately, neither one is prepared to compromise their existing relationships over.

One of the most impressive things about this film, is the cinematography...of Japan, and how for a such a wildly populated and bustling city is portray...and yet, without someone with you, that know's the city well, it can be a slightly overwhelming and blindingly isolated place.  The bright neon lights of Japan, represent one aspect of the city (a rapidly developing city)....yet, when Charlotte ventures out of the central town, and to the peaceful shrines, the other side of Japans beauty and heritage shows a different side (it's heritage & tradition).  And in this aspect it's one of the triumphs of Sofia's direction...indicating that being in another country can truly be a lonely affair, and that some people look for anything (or someone) to identify with, or make some form of connection with.  And not only that, but it's the very slight, almost incidental things that linger in the memory....like the way that curious glances are exchanged between the characters without any explanation, or how the camera will inexplicably have a shot of something completely obscure (like Bob's Slippers, or the shot of a building).  Or how certain things or never fully explained (like why Bob's marriage is breaking down / How Charlotte ended up with a husband, at a relatively young age / Or what Charlotte intends to do with herself), or even the little things that the audience is never allowed to hear or be privy to (When Bob Whispers something into Charlottes ear, just before they part for the final time.....which is not audible to the audience).

A lot of the humour is focused around the differences in the language barrier, and the lead characters bewilderment of being in an alien environment, and their adjustment to it.  And it's the way that Sophia skilfully brings all this incidental elements, into a hugely satisfying whole, to makes this film as her finest work to date.  How such uneventful subject matter on paper,  is generally made for riveting viewing, it's also one of those films that rewards multiple viewings....sure the storyline won't become clearer, as it's a very straightforward plot.  But the rapport between the two lead characters, feels more noticeably poignant and developed, and how intriguing their paths intersect, and touches upon how their failings in their own relationships, brings the two of them closer to each other.

For what is consider one of the finest indie films, over the last few years, this film has certainly had its detractors....and without undoing all the work, gone into giving this film, as glowing review, it has to be said that those looking for some truly substantial, or a significant development, will struggle to find anything here for them to latch onto.  And if slow-paced movies tend to irate...then you'll find nothing here, that is even worth the price of Renting the DVD.  It's a film that's a little too slow and considered to truly break the mainstream audience, sure it's had various (deserved) accolades humped upon it, but if you ask Joe Public...that actually went to the cinema to watch it, you'll definitely find a handful of people, that just didn't get on with the film.  But for those that regularly cast a keen eye over independent films, or indeed or just looking for something a little different from the norm, then I would argue that this is a film of tremendous resonance, and a truly remarkable film in it's own right, and one that needs to, at the very least be seen by those that have become a little jaded by American cinema over the last few years.  I strongly urge you to see this film...it may not change your perspective on the decline of outstanding films being released over the years, but in the world of independent cinema and distinguished films, it might be considered a small gem...but a gem nonetheless!!!

Extremely recommended....",1152662400,5,7203,5.132591958939265
1497923,4,B00005JMJ4,"I was determined to dislike this movie, for two reasons - - the hype it had received and the fact that this was Sofia Coppola's first written/directed movie, as I was certain she was nothing more than a naked emperor with the right name.  I was so very wrong.  This movie has stolen my heart!  Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson are so sublimely perfect, and beautiful, in this film.  This is a love story rooted in loneliness.  How anyone can be lonely in a crowded city like Tokyo is almost unfathomable, but that is what makes the story so true.  I loved the humor in the imagery, the stark contrasts between these two Americans and their Japanese counterparts.  I especially appreciated the beautiful and refreshing ending.  Anything else would have been a disappointment.  Many people I admire and respect hated this film, and that puzzles me.  I was transfixed yet giggled out loud several times.  Kudos to you, Ms. Coppola, for a beautifully written and directed experience.  I only wish I had shared it with someone I love.",1151366400,3,1030,4.724719101123595

1497925,3,B00005JMJ4,"This movie is great for someone who hasn't visited Japan, but want to or plans to.  It's labelled as a romnatic comedy, but the romance is not anything steamy.  The comedy is smart, culturally eccentric, and sometimes just seems too dry.  The movie is more like a well done excerpt on the film crew's journey in Japan rather than a movie which stands on its own.  There was way too much karaoke in it- it was more of a filler to make the movie last longer.  Scarlett Johansen gets great reviews for this- she poses great at the beginning.  The Japanese imagery in the movie is impeccable- when they show the pond, it's breathtaking.  Nothing too awe-inspiring otherwise- too critically raved for what it is.  Not a must see, but an ""I don't mind seeing.""",1149811200,,754,4.533333333333333
1497926,2,B00005JMJ4,"This is a film that both my daughter and I were interested in seeing, given the acclaim that Bill Murray's performance had drawn. Moreover, the film itself had drawn critical acclaim. So, when my daughter was home from college one weekend, we decided to hunker down and watch it together. When we both fell asleep while watching it, we decided that we were just tired. So, we decided to give it another go around the next evening. Well, unlike love, it was not much better the second time around, though we managed to avoid falling asleep, yet again.

Quite frankly, if Sophia Coppola, the writer and director of this film, were not the daughter of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, I am convinced that this film would have quickly vanished without a trace. In fact, I doubt that it would even have been made. When her acting career fizzled, after making her less than memorable acting debut in her father's film ""Godfather III"", Sophia Coppola apparently turned her hand to directing and was let loose upon an unsuspecting public.

While this film has good production values, it simply meanders along in a loosey-goosey sort of way. If focuses upon two individuals, Americans who find themselves in Tokyo, alienated from their surroundings and, seemingly, from life in general. One of these individuals is Bob Harris, a film actor on a career downslide, who now finds himself shilling whiskey in Japan for mega bucks, while his movie career is at an impasse. The other is a beautiful twenty-five year old woman, a Yale Graduate with a degree in philosophy, who is in Japan with her husband, a photographer who is working on a shooting assignment.

Bob Harris, played with wry bemusement by Bill Murray, is a man who is alienated from his family and, quite frankly, just plain lonely. His is a stark universe, as he seems to have a myopic view on life, seeing little beyond his luxury hotel's bar, where he like to go and drink. Charlotte, played with surprising maturity and flair by eighteen year old Scarlett Johansson, feels bereft and set adrift, as she struggles to keep herself occupied while her husband is ostensibly working. It is these two souls whose worlds collide, coloring their perspectives on life when an unlikely bond forms between them.

The film, which takes place in Tokyo, Japan, appears to mock the Japanese. Its stereotypic portrayal of the Japanese people, generally as buffoons, is reprehensible and a cheap joke. Sophia Coppola apparently thinks that the way Japanese people speak English is funny, as it is a running, unfunny joke through out the film. Since the film takes place in Japan, perhaps it might have been funnier to see Bob (or Charlotte) attempt to speak Japanese, rather than turn Bob into the quintessential ugly American.

The film meanders along lacking a definitive narrative and any real profundity of thought. While there is definition about the characters' exterior selves, the film never delves into their inner selves in defining their present state of affairs. There are no big or traditional cinematic moments. Unfortunately, there are no small ones either, as there is really no introspection by either of the two protagonists. This is a film that viewers will either love or hate. I fall into the latter category. ""Lost in Translation"" is simply lost on me.",1149638400,,3320,4.910873440285205

Coppola put alot of heart in this film and showed she got skills like her father. The cinematography and music were perfect for this type of film. This is alot more than your average love story, There was alot of symbolisim and subtext in alot of scenes. For example when Charlotte was given the flower to put in the pot, How each flower they put in was carefully done is a way of saying everyone has a place in life without acually saying it. Its obvious The movie had alot to do with soul searching and loneliness but it all comes together as a love story. Bob or Charlotte were never really happy when they were around anyone but eachother. Coppola showed a connection between two people in a unique way. I understand why this film won so maney awards, and I think it can definitly be called art in a movie form.",1147392000,2,924,4.372093023255814

The only thing they had in common was mutual misery and the inability to make a decision or rise above their own self-pity.

I guess this movie would appeal to people who have never traveled, or have traveled while never immersing themselves in the experience. Maybe people who have never had a positive experience traveling, or who have never shared a deep relationship during an unknown experience. If they had, they'd know these two were simply losers who found each other.

Murray gives his character some depth and Johansson gives her character that vulnerabity, that makes you fall for her as Murray does.  The Tokyo local is extremely interesting and since it is so unusual for a film to be shot on location in Japan it gives the movie a truly unique feel.  The film is paced in a slow and deliberate way, and some may feel it lags and maybe it does at times, but you always want to know how it will end, you are invested in these characters.

In the movie, Charlotte and her actor friend are equally lost and equally lonely.  The difference is that Charlotte is young, and she still has plenty of time ahead of her to turn her life around.

1498027,3,B00005JMJ4,"Might contain a few spoilers!

""Lost in Translation"" is a film about two strangers who meet and form an unlikely bound and friendship. The film's stars are played by comic genius Bill Murray (Bob Harris) and the charismatic rising young actress Scarlett Johansson (Charlotte). Bob is a washed up actor who was once a famed celebrity, but now he's stuck doing commercials in various places, for the film he's sent to Japan (he seems to be famous there). Bob is pretty much bored the moment he arrives in Tokyo, he has nothing in common with anyone, thus doesn't talk much. He does however have several humorous encounters with citizens, which never end well thanks to the language barrier. Charlotte on the other hand, is a recently married young woman who's accompanying her photographer husband on a work related trip, which happens to be Tokyo, Japan. She like Bob is also bored in this new foreign environment and she spends most of her time moping around the hotel bedroom. All this changes though with the eventual meet between Bob and Charlotte where they click right away. Despite the age gap they seem to get along and understand each other. They are both American after all. Thus, both Charlotte and Bob spend the rest of the film exploring the city visiting strip clubs, dance clubs and bars. Their excursions have a positive effect on them since they learn to appreciate the Japanese city life and for moments they forget about all their problems.

I thought the film was Okay nothing special or great to write home about. With the universal acclaim the film received I expected a laugh out loud comedy; the film only manages to make us grin and chuckle a few times, but nothing really to make us consider it a comedy, so the film did disappoint me.(the film explores human loneliness and boredom). I thought it was too subtle; I agree it makes the two lead performances feel extremely real, but that wasn't enough to save the film. The two leads are miserable and lonely characters whose desperation and misery brings them together. They have long conversations about their life and try to figure out who they really are and the meaning of everything in their lives (from what I remember since I can't remember much from this forgettable film). It sounds good on paper not on film, why bore us showing the boredom the lead characters are going through? Might have been better with a bit more melodrama to spice things up.

Furthermore, You'd think the intellectual and mature dialogue the film offers would be a plus, but its not considering the fact that the conversations are not remotely intriguing, so they did not capture my attention (in many scenes). Although, the film does offer things of interest such as the cinematography and the leads subtle performances and chemistry. The cinematography was quite amazing and it in no way made the film seem low budget, which it was with a production budget of 4 million (looks more expensive). The performances were also great. As I already mentioned they were subtle, so they felt real and natural. While watching Bill and Scarlett on screen they made you forget you were observing actors perform they truly became their characters. I felt like I was viewing a documentary about two people's long friendship. Bill and Scarlett's characters might have just met, but their on screen chemistry really makes you believe they've been friends for a very long time. With the performances realism I ended up caring for them, I felt sympathy for them. I also loved the last good bye between Bob and Charlotte, it was moving and heartbreaking, I empathized with them watching their sad facial expressions.

The film had a lot to offer especially the performances, gorgeous cinematography and the leads enchanting chemistry, but in the end I didn't feel completely satisfied; it lacked excitement and life (too gloomy). Not a bad film, but not exactly a good one either, although the strong performances and chemistry of the leads almost made me like the film.",1140220800,6,4011,4.8425655976676385

It is about these two people: One is a young bored woman in a Hotel, who tries to spend time by ikebana, spending time at the bar, smoking(which her husband hates) and an elderly man who is feeling lost in Japanese culture. And how they try to get along on a common thread.

Some of the scenes looks to be making fun of the Japanese:  But they are not, cultural differences always makes one look funnier and weird when compared to the other.

Having been to Korea, I feel that the translation scenes were  exactly the same as what we practically experience.  I used to go to these meetings where my customer would talk what seemed to me like 10 lines and the translator would explain to me in 1 line and then I would ask her 'Are you sure - thats all what he said ?'

He is a has-been 70s actor, going on his fifties, and she is a young Yale university graduate in Philosophy. What do they have in common? It would seem everything would pull them apart. Yet, they find each other - because of their intense loneliness, and because of the soul-searching that invariably accompanies young and middle age.

Bob isn't quite so sure whether his choice to become an actor was the good one; he's in his fifties, has been married for half his life;he is often traveling, away from his family. He is estranged from his wife, and the type of father that forgets his kids' birthday, yet still loves them deeply. Charlotte is a bright young graduate, and she has been married for two years only to a photographer (this is the reason why she is in Tokyo - she is accompanying him on the trip) who is not quite as bright as she is, and is also very busy, leaving her alone in her golden cage. She doesn't know what she wants to be in life, and probably questions her choice of mate as well. Neither of them speaks japanese, and they both suffer from insomnia.

This film, is certainly one of the best recent movies done. Admittedly, if your type of movie is action-oriented and fast-paced, it might be better if you saved yourself the trouble of watching Lost in Translation. Sofia Coppola's style is slow and methodical, yet deeply entrancing. The movie traps you, and puts you into the shoes of the protagonists (the gorgeous soundtrack helping immensely). You can feel the ennui like they do, and be sad as they are.

The story is one of affection - dare I say love? Between the two protagonists. Little is shown, but everything can be interpreted.

So it goes for the legions of ill directed cinephiles who erroneously watched Lost In Translation *sigh*

The ambiance in the movie is mesmerising, Murray and Johannsson are beautifully directed and the ending is sublime. This is more of a ""repertoire"" film, and by god if you love this type of movie, you will ADORE Lost In Translation. One of the best american movies of all time.",1137024000,5,718,4.4393939393939394
1498203,5,B00005JMJ4,"The premise of `Lost in Translation' is simple.  Bob (Murray) is a middle-aged actor who is unhappy with his career and feels distanced from his family.  He travels abroad  - rather begrudgingly - to star in a Japanese whiskey commercial .  Charlotte (Johansson) is a young, attractive, and slightly elitist Yale graduate.  She is married to a busy photographer but doesn't seem to have much direction in her own life.  Eventually, Bob and Charlotte meet in the bar of a Tokyo hotel.  They connect immediately, which makes sense, because they have a lot in common.  Both - despite outwardly wonderful lives - are feeling lonely and isolated, and both have been doing some pretty heavy thinking ... about relationships, about their pasts, about their futures, and (however cliche it might sound) about the meaning of life.  One of the things I love about this film is that it handles the characters' contemplativeness very gently.  Take the scene where Charlotte is talking on the telephone to a friend (this is one of the most poignant moments in the film).  Earlier that day, she had stumbled upon a seemingly ancient religious ceremony, somewhere in the lush outskirts of the city.  But, as she admits to her friend, ""I didn't feel anything.""  Although her comment is a bit vague and understated, we get the sense that Charlotte is frightened by her detachment and nihilistic leanings.

While Bob and Charlotte are not able to provide ""answers"" for one another, they are able to enjoy an emotional relationship.  The movie follows them as they spend time together exploring the hotel and the city - sometimes having outrageous fun (drinking to excess and singing karaoke) and sometimes just sitting quietly and talking.  Although this film is subtle and slow-moving and many will find it dull (just look at the reviews below - I mean, some people are down-right angry!), others - like me - will be absorbed.  The cinematography is stunning, and a lot of fabulous, dreamy music is used in the soundtrack (My Bloody Valentine complements the film's tone perfectly).  I also think that 'Lost in Translation' can be quite humorous, in its own, quiet way.  For instance, when Charlotte and her husband bump into a young actress in the hotel lobby, it is rather amusing to contrast Charlotte's calm, cool, and sharp personality with that of the ridiculously bubbly chatterbox.  I would also add that this film's final scene makes for one of the most perfect and simple endings I have ever come across (I am reminded of the PJ Harvey song ""You Said Something"").

In conclusion, if you can handle a slow-moving film, if you enjoy intelligent characters, and if you are attracted to stunning images, you may very well like this film.  If you prefer a lot of structure and dialogue, or if you are hoping for quintessential Murray, I'd skip it.",1136505600,6,2835,4.8625

I don't usually find it difficult to appreciate off-beat films on an artistic or intellectual level, but what this movie lacked in its ability to entertain (which is to say, none whatsoever), it failed to make up for in substance. I was unable to forge any sort of emotional connection with its two protagonists, and Sofia Coppola's script was sparse to the point of irritation. One of my most joyless and insipid movie watching experiences in recent memory.",1136160000,19,570,4.947916666666667
1498300,2,B00005JMJ4,"but otherwise the story was maddeningly dull...I love Japan and Tokyo and wanted to connect to the story. Did not.

 Bill Murray's character was bitter and mean, blaming his wife for their crumbling marriage when, to me, he was rather undesirable and hateful. And one subliminal message in the film was blame the wife, she doesnt understand poor Bill M's character, he is a complete mess but it isn't his fault...it's because she is so concerned with interior decorating that he takes up with a Japanese hooker. Oh poor man! No wonder he was drawn to a nubile 19 year old blonde babe ( uhhh..DUH)

And he just has to suuuuuuuffffffer.... not at all look at himself or his flaws. It was  humor humor humor ( dark at that) with the premise that he was a bumbling aging misunderstood semi tragic hero.

And blah blah blah  we're still  seeing movies with 50 ish leading men connecting with/wooing/wanting/getting girlwomen more than half their age. I know that comment may anger some, and seem like I am putting my issues onto this review, but what I am trying to say is this kind of pairing in movies is so so so common, predictable , rampant and basically a turn off; it did contribute to my disinterest in the story line, though I promise, I tried to like it.  But come on! Only in the movies would a luminous blonde fall for aforementioned ""hero"". I can hear it now: ""But it IS a movie"" I know that, but again, this kind of storyline is so commonplace that when the old guy gets the girl it is never meaningful, it's just a way to market a film by showing a chick in her underwear.

 I agree with another reviewer who mentioned ethnic stereotyping... much of the film's supposed humor was based on making fun of Japanese language and customs.

 I want more in a film and especially in the female characters. I just did not believe in their connection or even care, actually.

BUT I will say, ( don't want to give it away) the very last scene was lovely, it really was. Throughout the movie, the visuals were great, and Sofia Coppola has credited the more experienced people in her crew that helped her achieve such a look. Too bad the richness of her crew's experience did nt help the characters.",1135987200,14,2197,4.489949748743719

No. Not even my close friends under any normal circumstances (seriously).  There are so many things to do, to see, and to film in Tokyo; and I don't understand why the director, Sophia Coppola, picked a hospital and made fun of the people there.  Just plain boring.  But I find the Karaoke scene interesting because this is really part of the Japanese culture and that storyline should be developed more.  Afterall, it'd better to have more communications among the characters in the film.",1135641600,15,627,4.585585585585585

Having read several reviews of this one, and having a long-time liking for Bill Murray, I forced myself to watch it through to the bitter end.  It was no exception to the thirty minute rule.

I can certainly relate to being stuck in a strange city with nothing to do, but the concept really runs dry pretty quickly.  There are a couple of redeeming points about the film - it's interesting as a travelogue, the portraits of vapid people are fairly good - but all in all, it's just plain dull, dull, dull.",1135555200,15,626,4.3247863247863245
1498304,3,B00005JMJ4,"But having lived in Tokyo for 8 years, part of which was at the height of the ""bubble economy"", I have a hard time figuring out the mind of the heroine in this plot, namely the girl who becomes enamored with Mr. Murray's character.

She's in Tokyo, apparently never been there before, has one week to be there before she leaves, and instead of having some curiosity and going out and interacting, she stays around a hotel room all day. She ventures out, a little, mostly to places that seem familiar and urban. I realize Japan has its share of culture shock, but her attitude was a bit over the top.

What is this? Jet lag? Didn't bring a guidebook? Instant homesickness? Maybe she's just a boring person.

I think the reason that the Japanese like this movie so much is because it reflects THEIR attitude toward foreigners and foreign travel, e.g. - Don't get too involved and hang around the hotel where the other Japanese are. Also, with ""Japan as backdrop"" it's mostly non-judgemental about the country.

After a couple of YEARS in Japan, (and a few vactions) I started acting a little like that and would retreat to the privacy of my apartment on a regular basis. The only reason I stayed for years was because I lucked out and got a job that had 5 months paid vacation time every year. But I only started turning into a hermit after a LONG TIME had passed, and the place was starting to get old.

This was also one of the draggiest movies I'd seen for a while. With its Stanley Kubrick style plot timing, (SLOW) I can see why it drove some people nuts to watch it.

I do realize that the reason for the relationship with Murray is her immature husband's emotional neglect, but the artsy-fartsy emphasis on visuals overwhelms the story line, and I found myself ""Lost in a Coma"" a number of times while watching it.

I did like the way the relationship was handled - with a fair amount of sensitivity and more realism than a lot of hackneyed relationship flicks. But parts of it were so slow it was like watching paint dry.",1135123200,12,2027,4.462162162162162

1498306,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sensitive, smart, masterfully performed and flawlessly directed. In my opinion, one of the best films of all times. Johansson is sexy and intelligent, however a little snobish and lost. Bill Murray brings great dramedy doing what no other actor could have achieved this perfectly: He is funny without trying to be funny. He is a sad man that has not lost his sense of humor.

In a conventional Hollywod film Charlotte and Bob would have had an affair and blah blah blah, but here the relationship between them is treated very subtly, it evolves in a beautiful and organic way. They like and understand each other, maybe there's even love, but at this moment their lives are so sad, that from within their desperation this brief contact is enough.

Many will say that the film is highly overrated and it lacks a clear narrative structure, but why do you need that when all the other elements are there; besides that's the whole point: the film IS called LOST in Translation.

Coppolla includes silent, reflective moments, and also ridiculous  over the top misshaps; reminding us how funny and enjoyable life can be; if we let it. (or we could end up in a monotone existence like Bob.)

This is truly a cinematic gem, incredibly relatable, even if you are not a burnt out movie star working in Japan or a young college grad at an emotional crossroad; it is about everything: life, love, isolation, humor, children, fun, drugs, youth, innocence, Sex, marriage. just great!",1134950400,6,1469,4.790513833992095
1498307,5,B00005JMJ4,"I don't know why I had trouble with this movie.  Old guy gets young, beautiful girl ought to work for me, being an old guy myself.  Maybe I was jealous.  I couldn't do karaoke the way Bill Murray does it.  And after a night on the Tokyo town, I couldn't carry Scarlett Johansson home in my arms and tuck her into bed and turn out the light.  Well, I couldn't carry her.  And she does have pretty eyes and nice legs and beautiful skin.  And she's a good actress, although this part did not stretch her or even challenge her.  And after a fashion one gets used to the slightly arrogant Bill Murray style.  His character is, after all, an action hero who gets paid $2-million to make a whiskey commercial.

Whiskey.  I think that is what it is.  I don't like whiskey or cigarettes and I usually don't like people who like cigarettes and whiskey, although I recall a song from my parents' time: ""Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild women/They'll drive you crazy, they'll drive you insane.""  (I'll take the wild, wild women.)  Such might conquer the boredom felt by out-of-towners in a high rise hotel in downtown Tokyo that director Sofia Coppola (Francis Ford's daughter) was at great pains to get across to us in the opening scenes.  I also don't like bars and I think that people who spend their time hanging out in bars are mostly lonely alcoholics.  Ditto for gratuitous smoking in movies and obvious product placements.

So I almost gave up on this, but the DVD jacket does say, ""OVER 80 FOUR-STAR REVIEWS.""  (That would five stars on Amazon.)  Something must be wrong with me.  Or maybe there is a big contrast coming in the second half of the film, and all this 21st century, big city, international First World ennui is necessary to set that up.  But isn't it a little heavy how Scarlett hangs around in her panties waiting for her husband to return, and when he does he either goes to sleep or off to doing something else.  Wow, one would think he would NOTICE.  The camera surely does.

Okay, I saw the rest of the film and ...

There is a lot of artistic shtick in this movie. In fact it would be an art movie if it weren't aimed so directly at the mass mind--well, the mass mind over thirty.  The long pauses and the way the camera lingers to SHOUT: notice this scene! how excellent it is, or to punctuate a point, how profound or how prosaic.

But I like the clumsiness of their relationship and the way it is drawn out.

The shots of Japan are wonderful, like a travel log.  Mount Fujiyama in gray in the background; Mount Fujisan in the background in full color and snow cap.  The games arcade in Tokyo, the game machines like Vegas slot machines all in a row.  The clean, straight lines of the bars and the exercise rooms, black and whites; the square wooden bowls out of which they drink the wine; the lights at night on the boulevard, outdoing Times Square in their gaudy neon-ness.  The touristy feel to the movie.  The Japanese untranslated.  The sleeplessness as though they were near the Arctic Circle with twenty hours of daylight.  The easy Hollywood feel to the psychology: our hero's pix on the side of trucks drinking Japanese whiskey, suavely; the need for the hero to hide from his public; his obviously dyed hair; the ""satire"" of the blonde mediocre starlet who affects anorexia; the sense that Sofia Coppola lived something like this.  One can imagine her boredom, and then the interested older man.

I also liked the bit with the semi-talented lounge singer, again like Las Vegas--her picking him up, so to speak, he too drunk to protest or to remember.  Again the Hollywood idea of the pecking order.  The banality of the glamorous life.

It is also to Sofia Coppola's credit that she got the relationship exactly right: she knew how the old guy felt and she knew how the young girl felt, and she knew what was right and what would be the right ending.

I guess I should say why this movie affects me and brings out the impatience in me and calls forth my sardonic nature.  It is that I have been there where Bill Murray's character was and I played it the same way.  I am not so sure I did the right thing.  I tell myself I did, but I am not so sure.

This was one of those movies where when the credits roll you look around and think ""did I actually just waste 102 minutes of my life on this?""

During the whole movie all you can think about is, will Bill Murray and Johansson hook up, will they? Well, Dont hold your breath buddy...

But don't go into this film expecting the plot to follow cliches. Harris is a prisoner in a 5-star palace, dealing with a difficult wife back home, and running into nubile, much younger Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). You'd expect she and Harris and to have a sexual liaison. They do not, and the plot and script avoid a dozen other cliches.

Instead, the story takes Harris and Charlotte down unexpected Tokyo alleys while the two try and sort out their lives.

This film is directed with an eye to a stylistic capture of the reality of modern Japan. Bolstered by impressive cinematography (especially lighting and camera angles), it keeps the viewer interested and engaged as Murray and Johansson deliver consummate performances. Indeed, this is by far Bill Murray's finest work. Instead of the over-the-top characters in everything from ""Scrooged"" to ""Ghostbusters,"" we see an actor with depth of voice, emotion, and facial expression.

Sophia Coppola knows her subject, having spent several years in Japan. Perhaps she could have been a bit tighter with the editing, but there is little else bad to be said about this film.

""lost in translation"" was not the usual fare (thank dog)

although the actors were perfect and fabulous, the title was the star of the movie. if you go to see it, pretend that you don't understand english, japanese or german. that way, the words won't get in the way. just watch the characters and read their feelings... of course, half of those feelings will be, ""i don't think i understand what this person is saying""... but the other half of the feelings, if you tap into your own wellspring of experience, will be perfectly clear, clean water that cleanses all the dirt and guilt off your smelly feeties and your imperfect, filthy, little heart. <g>

i won't give away the middle of the movie. it almost drags too much, but it drags good for all the right reasons... just like real life.

in the end, the ""unwords"" say so much more than the words. bill murray whispers something into his week-long friend's ear...

his mouth is hidden by her hair and it's impossible to hear what he says. the viewer is FORCED to interpret what is said by reading the characters' eyes and their body language...

His wife, as he puts it, doesn't need him around anymore, and as she puts its, she's getting used to him never being around.  He's always away shooting movies or adds like this one.  Charlotte (Scarlott Johansson) is a twenty-five year old bride of two years whose photographer husband (Giovanni Rabisi) would rather spend time with an actress (Anna Farris) he seems to be smitten with.  Charlotte and Bob have a few things in common.  They are in Tokyo against their will and they pretty much hate the idea.  They are both in relationships not even strong enough to lean on and they are lost in themselves.  Charlotte doesn't know what she wants to do with her life and in a way Bob is in the same boat.  They form a relationship based on their similarities and they spend their time together hoping form karyokie bars and hot spots to cocktail bars and hotel rooms.  The movie revolves around getting to know these two lost souls.  Bill Murry does amazing here.  He's spot on displaying the feeling of being alone, being lonely and searching for hope in something, anything.  He's a great actor and portrays that wonderfully here.  He's funny and desprate all at the same time.  Scarlott, who I believe to be one of the most talented and beautiful young actresses around does unbelievable here and I agree with the millions who were pissed she didn't recieve an oscar nod.  She portrays the lovetorn wife, finding the attention she lacks from her mate in a man she barely knows but is drawn to for obvious reasons.

Scarlett's talent is immesurable and her ability to play such a mature and lost young woman with such ease amazes me.  Bill Murray, as always, is unparalleled in his humor and gripping performance.  It was odd for me accept him in a remotely serious role, but this character was perfect.

You either love this movie, or you hate it.  I am definitely in the ""love"" category.  Perhaps infatuated is a more appropriate word?  Either way, I couldn't have liked it any more.  It is, hands down, one of my favorite movies of all time.

I think the real kicker, the real deciding factor of whether or not you will love or hate this movie depends on if you can relate to the two main characters.  Watching this movie for the first time, I was convinced Charlotte was based on me.  It was like watching myself ... everything about her (aside from her breast size ... ahem) was me.

This movie is not for someone who wants excitement and action, but rather is for someone who can look deep inside to ones own sole and connect.

If the film's theme is just The finding of good company even in a strange world, The solace one finds in another in loneliness,then I would have to say that it is very poorly done.

The story is basically about a famous American actor who got an advertising job in Tokyo, but when he got there he is alienated by the Japanese culture and had some difficulties communicating, but then he met a woman named Charolett, who also feel the same way. Well, first I have to say something about the acting, it's B-A-D. Bill Murray, in the entire film has nothing but a depressed look on him. He showed almost no character transformation, at least not in his acting. He did not get more and more cheerful, but continues to ""get lost"" in his loneliness. The whole film did not give me a feeling of comfort, since the message is ""The solace one finds in another in loneliness"" and therefore it's suppose to be comforting. But after I watche the movie it left me with an empty feeling that I even cried. Because the message the movie gave me is that life is empty and meaningless, that even in such a gorgeous city, you can't be happy and find things you enjoy. I also felt tramendously lost, lost in wandering what the purpose of life is. Lost in feeling that there's always something missing in life.

The other thing is the Asian discrimination. Like another reviewer said, the two protagonists never managed to learn about their surroundings, never bothered to learn to speak Japanese because they just assumed that everybody knows how to speak English. If that is not a sense of superiority, then I don't know what is. Through their eyes, the Japanese people seemed extremely uncool, they are silly, stupid, couldn't say the ""Rs"" right, and have no artistic talent. All these things are discrimination and racisim. And I don't find it the least bit funny. So yeah, the protagonists wanna get the hell outta there, I would too. But the reason I received was not because they are so alienated, but that the place itself was so incredibly stupid to stay in. And this is also shown in the plot too, for example Bob and Charolett complained about cooking their own food.

Overall, I cannot understand why this film actually touched the Oscars, I guess once again I can say that the critics are mindless idiots. Also I just have to say to you guys, don't persume you know a culture or a country just because you've read books on it, studied it or watched it on TV. Because all those things can be biased. Go to the country, spend time there, and you may be deeply surprised. As someone who lived half of my life in one country and half in another, I have the right to say this.",1125964800,14,2823,4.509765625

The movie did have some beautiful shots of Tokyo but that was really about it. The story itself was very understated and simple and really never took off in my opinion. The story can be summed up by saying that two Americans unhappy with their relationships meet each other and then wander around Tokyo. Their wandering around takes them to karaoke bars, strip joints and sushi bars. That's it. Nothing beyond that really happens.",1125100800,6,645,4.758928571428571

It's as if the story was made up as it went along. There was no real script it seems. To say the whole film was nothing but an expensive home video of tourists wouldn't be far off. Literally, this is nothing but people on vacation, who happen to be sad, doing stuff together, and then presto, we have a real winner because Scarlett Johanssen's panties are shot tastefully by a bigshot director's daughter.

1498701,2,B00005JMJ4,"This is what happens when Hollywood imitates an indie/art house cinematic effort.  In that respect the film is so lucky, because it has an instant defense to all who criticize it: if you don't like this film, obviously you'd rather be watching ""Dukes of Hazzard"".

This film takes a formulaic Hollywood sensibility and gives it a languid, arty presentation.  The slow, slow pace would be okay if it were used to probe into the depths of the character's personalities, but it doesn't--maybe because there's nothing to the characters.  The girl lays around trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life, and the guy is having a mid-life crisis.  Nothing much more than that gets revealed, but compared to all the cardboard supporting characters, the stars seem like real 3-D personalities.

The film does even worse with its ""exploration"" of life in a foreign culture.  I checked out this film because one review praised it for its look at the problems of dealing with life in another culture.  Since I've lived overseas for a number of years now, this sounded interesting.  Instead, one gets a series of boilerplate yuks about strange foreign cultures: everyone speaks a bewildering language (imagine!), the interpreter translates 45 foreign words into 3 English words, the Japanese people are short, etc. etc.  Look, the main characters of this movie are in Tokyo for a week or two and they seem completely alienated and devastated by it all--these people should definitely have stayed home!!

Another comment about the glacial speed of this movie: was it really necessary for the karaoke scene to go on for so long?  You get the idea after the first song, that these are people in Tokyo amusing themselves with karaoke, that's what Japanese people do, after all (isn't it?).  After the second song, you figure that the point has been even better made, but by the third song, when Bill Murray starts to launch into the Roxy Music tune, barely able to keep from slipping into his Saturday Night Live lounge-crooner mode, you have to wonder what the point is.

If you like slow films, check out something by Bergman or Tarkovsky instead.  This one's just dull.",1123372800,11,2168,4.853260869565218

They don't get anything that is character driven, or at the least, don't get characters that are not bigger than life good guys or bad guys.

Maybe one has to have been at a point in life at some time feeling out of place, lost, looking for something and not sure what, to be able to understand this.

1498703,4,B00005JMJ4,"In case the title confuses some, I think this is one of the 10 best movies of 2003.  However, I really have no idea who this movie is trying to reach out to, and I also don't know anybody who might like this film.  I love it, but I guess the only way to keep this review fresh is to acknowledge and criticze the common remarks.  Here are my two cents.

""This movie isn't about anything""
---Very true, but it's not trying to be.  I know that's not a very appealing aspect, but for me that helps the movie.  I believe that life has a purpose, but I also admit that life is not spelled out like it is in epics or Shakespeare...or 99% of the movies I've ever seen.

""This movie isn't funny.""
---This movie isn't very funny.  That, sadly, is one of its faults.  I'm all for dry humor, but Bob Harris (played wonderfully by Bill Murray) is trying to limit his reputation as an actor, keeping things on the down-low.  Well, writer-director Sofia Coppola should've rethought that approach, because you can't aim for something with your characters and then expect the audience to react the exact opposite.  In other words, you can't make Bill Murray funny by making him desperately trying to be unfunny.  Nevertheless, I smiled and nodded at the movie's undeniable charm.

""Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give the best performances of their career.""
---Johansson was equally good in ""Girl With A Pearl Earring,"" but she's perfect here.  She's young, but intelligent.  She's lonely, but makes efforts to cope with that.  She's confused, but she learns that there's plenty of time left in her life.  As far as Murray goes, I prefer his comedic turns in ""Rushmore"" and ""Groundhog Day,"" but I will say that he perfectly captures the character of Bob Harris, and acheives what he tries to accomplish with this role.  Roger Ebert said it best ""Bill Murray is becoming the master of minimalist expressions.""

""Sofia Coppola makes up for the bad acting in 'The Godfather: Part III'.""
---I, for one, thought she was ""OKAY"" in that movie, but who cares?  She's behind the camera, and to me, she would've been my pick for the Best Director Of The Year (Oscars chose Peter Jackson...excellent alternative).  She did not go for an epic or grandiose feel.  She acheived what very movies do for me...I felt like I was actually there in the world of the characters.  I felt what Charlotte and Bob felt...which is a good thing and a bad thing.  When they were having fun, so was I.  When they were bored, Coppola captured that a little too well in a couple of scenes.  When Bob and Charlotte don't want to leave each, I didn't want the movie to end.

""I'm glad that Bob and Charlotte don't have a passionate relationship, but an actual bond.""
---I don't know who said it first or best, but I am in total agreement.  The last thing this movie needed was a sex scene.

""The supporting characters are either underused, or unnecessary.""
---This is one of those points where I understand the intention (they're supposed to be quirky and add flavor to the oddities of the Japanese culture), but again, it works too well.  To develop them would've hurt the movie, but the way they are isn't completely satisfactory.  This is a lesser-of-two-evils debate.

""This movie is boring.""
---I guess since a lot people have made this comment, I suppose my disagreement won't change their minds.  ""Lost In Translation"" is admittedly slow, but that's because the movie focuses on the week that Bob and Charlotte share with each other.  Sofia Coppola is patient with their scenes together - I can't back this up, but I think a lot of people are simply impatient viewers.

""This movie was way too over-praised.""
---I don't believe ""Lost In Translation"" is a masterpiece, but it is an excellent movie.  Even if this film isn't entertaining to everybody (nobody I know likes this movie!), can anyone deny that this movie is something unique?  Can't even the un-impressed audiences admit that Sofia Coppola tried to go for an emotional response that few filmmakers have attempted?  One thing I believe that nobody can deny about ""Lost In Translation"" is this: There has never been a more honest or believable film ever.  Because there is no conventional plot structure or character development, but instead pure experience and emotion...you will never see a more genuine motion picture.

I wish I could recommend this movie to people, and it saddens me that most don't enjoy it.  However, this movie gave me such a strong reaction, that I had to put it in words.

I love this movie, but it's an excellent film that somehow is ""Not Recommended.""  Definitely check it out BEFORE you buy it!",1123027200,7,4643,4.694306930693069

There was so much that could have been done comedically with the premise of this,without stooping to lowbrow slapstick (though that has it's place too). The same story could have been told in America. I thought the setting of Tokyo was,with a couple of exceptions,wasted.

  I found it very difficult to get to the ending,,and I'm perfectly capable of getting through a movie where stuff doesn't get ""blowed up real good"" every two minutes.

  But,i've always been one to make myself sit through a movie, and I'm still glad I sat through it, because my prediction of ""we're going to see a lot more of Scarlet Johansen"" appears to be coming true.",1121817600,8,679,4.616666666666666
1498705,5,B00005JMJ4,"This film is about the paradoxical loneliness and emptiness in a world that is burgeoning with people.

And amidst this, the strange and unexpected connections between people. It shows that the human soul never ceases to be lonely, even when one is married with children. It never ceases seeking connections, other souls to travel this journey with.

To me, Lost in Translation is also about the magic of travel. When you are alone in a foreign land, you never know when you will fall in love with a stranger, whom you might spend a few hours or a few days with, and quite probably never meet again -- but the memory lingers in your mind forever.

Very little actually happens in this film in terms of events, so if you need lots of events to enjoy a film, this is not for you. but if you are sensitive to body language, ambience, and subtle expressions, you'll love the volumes that Murray and Johansson speak without saying much - or sometimes, without saying anything at all. People around them may be continuously speaking Japanese, and they barely understand a word. but between them, they understand each other perfectly even when they say nothing... a glance, a smile... and there's magic. The magic of being Lost in Translation, together.

1498706,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is almost like a Japanese movie. It moves very slow but somehow grows on you if you manage to see it to the end. There is no playing to the gallery either as the director lets the film speak for itself without using too many words, the characteristics typical of some of the finest Japanese films. True, all those Japanese characters are depicted rather streotypically, but believe me, they do behave like that. And I found nothing chauvinistic or offensive about that at all. The Last Samurai is a lot worse in that respect. Tokyo is one of the most boring cities in Japan in my opinion but the city as shown in the film looks much more charming than it actually is. The emotional interplay between the two main characters is depicted with subtlety and fineness, showing that they are lost in themselves just as much as they are lost in translation, and that they slowly rediscover themselves while interacting with one another. A very charming film.",1121040000,4,956,4.662721893491124
1498707,2,B00005JMJ4,"This is one of the best films of 03? You have GOT to be kidding me. I forced myself to watch this movie all the way to the finish in hopes that somewhere along the way, a PLOT of some sort would become discernible. No such luck though, before I knew it, the credits were rolling, and with that, another hour and a half of my life down the drain.

What a complete waste of time. It's a little love story of two people coming together in a foreign country, but since it has nothing interesting to tell, the movie goes nowhere, and there's no payoff. It reminded me of Garden State (which is still better than this) in the way I felt like I was watching two random people dealing with their little relationship and the movie putting them through their motions. I don't consider it entertainment to sit there and watch two people go on their little dates and smile, flirt, and giggle.

Far as I'm concerned, here's the plot summary: two strangers meet, they get to know each other, they do stuff together, then sad, the end.

The fact this movie takes place in Tokyo is really of no consequence. Provided that we still have our two main characters in a foreign country, this movie could've easily taken place in any other country and told the exact same story. In other words, the producers didn't bother to use the unique Tokyo environment to their advantage. This movie may be considered slightly above average at best.",1120953600,12,1417,4.484496124031008
1498787,3,B00005JMJ4,"Whoa, it seems like everyone is really divided on this one. It's either a ""best movie ever"" or a ""worst movie ever"". To me, Lost In Translation is decent, but very overrated.

The biggest problem I have with this movie is that there is almost no story, and almost no progression of any sort. 25 minutes into the movie, I was getting really bored waiting for the two main characters to meet up, because absolutely nothing was happening.

Movies like Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and Napoleon Dynamite can get away with not having much of a story, because one of them absolutely drips with style and action sequences, and because the other one is so hilarious and off-beat. But Lost In Translation can't do that, because the focus is supposed to be on the two main characters, who aren't really...y'know, doing anything.

The real treat here is the gorgeous shots of the city. The flashing lights of the city skyline at night, the amazing view from the hotel...it's awesome. So is the overall atmosphere of the movie. It really DOES feel like you're in an unfamiliar, distant, fascinating land. Being a huge fan of anime and Japanese culture in general, I can really appreciate that type of feeling. The music selection fits perfectly with the atmopshere too. My Bloody Valentine is my favorite band, and their breathtaking song ""Sometimes"" (as well as 4 other songs from the newly returned Kevin Shields...HELL YEAH!) played over the sparkling skyscrapers is the highlight of the film for me.

Unfortunately, the dreamlike feel of the movie probably would've felt even more fleshed out if the two characters actually mattered to me. As it is, I really just don't care about Bob or Charlotte at all. They disappear into the background.

Like I said, it's decent, but you can get the same effect from looking at pictures of the Tokyo skyline. Reccomended only for very artistic people.

(Note: To the stuck-up 5-star reviews who think that the only people who hate this movie are braindead jocks who only like movies like xXx and The Fast and the Furious...do us a favor and shut the hell up. I like artsy, intellectual movies as much as the next guy, but Lost In Translation just flat-out isn't as deep as some people make it out to be)",1120694400,9,2223,4.701799485861183

1498789,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation tells the story of two people, basically alone in a foreign-speaking country, who share a connection.

Scarlett Johansson, a lonely newlywed with a busy husband, lounged around her hotel room in her underwear, looking out over the Tokyo skyline. The two happen to meet in the hotel bar, and they spend the week together, exploring the city and getting to know one another.

This movie is not epic. It is a small movie. But it also very delicately addresses the subject of confluence, convergence. Adrift in a sea of people who look different from you, speak a different language from you, can you make a connection? Can you share something with someone? Sofia Coppola's answer is yes.

This is Coppola's second feature-length work. (The Virgin Suicides was her first.) I look forward to seeing what she does next.",1120608000,,945,4.9

I think this will just be one of the movies I either don't get, or I saw the point but it was so small, I expected something bigger. I first saw a big chunck of this movie with a friend and even he was not amused at the movie. I tried to watch it two other times later to give it a try and I could not get through the whole thing. For me at least, I find this movie to be quiet, somewhat symbolic of something, and just stylish. It is stylish in a way that's not flashy, but trendy and artsy. I think it's hard to explain. I thought there was decent acting, but I don't feel that the actors were given much to do really. You do end up seeing a lot of nice scenes and images in Japan which I can appreciate. It is set in modern day Japan and you have Bill Murray and Scarlett J staring as the main actors...they end up forming a friendship (which I thought was going to turn into something more). You also see Anna Faris (Cindy fron Scary Movie) in kind of the same bubbly spirit.

I gave this movie 2 stars but I'd like to really give it 2 1/2 because of the picture and color of it and its style. Other than that, I did not like it. If you tend to like movies like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Equilibrium and things like that, you will most likely not like this film.

The intent of the movie is to submerge you in a world of surreal experiences, as any trip to a foreign country (especially to one as complex as japan) would be.

In their isolated states, they find each other in the most unlikely place, Japan, for comfort and the strength to carry on.

1498913,4,B00005JMJ4,"Tokyo sparkles as the third main character in this sweet, platonic, slice-of-life love story.

Set in the dazzling confusion of a far and exotic city, the story is full of courteous characters who communicate beyond words. Understatement and deep feelings abound in the superficial conversations of people just getting acquainted, such as Charlotte and Bob, or already too acquainted and too loosely attached, as in their respective marriages.

The music is atmospheric and dreamy, and the soundtrack includes Bill Murray's pleasant karaoke performance of ""More Than This.""

Having just returned from Tokyo and loving it, I've watched ""Lost in Translation"" at least three times, enjoying the opening scene of the Ginza district at night, its tall neon lights all in bewildering and utterly incomprehensible symbols, and the charming manners and gestures of the people.

We pointed to menus, just as Bob and Charlotte did, even in McDonald's, yes, McDonald's for pancake breakfast. It was too early in the morning for another tasty, raw octopus tentacle. And chopsticks were totally daunting. My husband observes that chopsticks, noodles and I were not a pretty sight.

I visited an art museum to see a Van Gogh exhibit--a contrast in cultures. I stood in front of Van Gogh's painting of the asylum where he stayed in his bi-polar bouts. A Japanese gentleman in a suit also stood there. We looked at the painting. We looked at each other. We looked at the painting, shook our heads, sighed over Van Gogh's pain. A million words passed between us in those looks.

So it was in LIT.

The laid-back pace of the character-driven story illustrated their jet-lagged boredom a little too well for my husband, a daughter, and a son-in-law, hence, the four stars. But another daughter and I loved it.

The understated, sometimes hilarious performances of the entire cast, including an over-the-top lounge singer and a Britney Spears wannabe are all excellent.

And I know I'll never approach an ellyptical machine again without smiling.

They could eliminate one tasteless scene, however, without losing the story line, ***when Charlotte says they're going to meet Charlie at a place called Orange. That's a good time to hit a button called Skip*** because it turns out to be a raunchy night club they soon leave, with a vulgar song in the background. The whole scene was out of place, alas, and could have been only suggested or totally left out instead of so in-your-face. Yuck. And the movie would be amusing family fare without it.

The song is mercifully left off the wonderful, ethereal sound track.

The story could be a good springboard for discussion: Would you mind your spouse, in lonely desperation, sharing a bed, only in platonic innocence, with another?

More to the point, how would you keep your spouse--and yourself--from reaching that point of lonely desperation? Maybe you could work out together on the ellyptical.... :)",1118188800,,2931,5.0686070686070686

Nothing at all grabbed my interest. I neither empathised nor sympathised with the characters, and the only thing that kept me to the end of the film is that i'd made a big deal of it myself to my companion, based on the media coverage and reviews.

The story can be covered with a hugely brief synopsis. Two people, of different age-groups and sexes, in Tokyo although not really wanting to be there, are drawn to each other via the hotels bar, and become friends, both feeling gladness at the others uncomfortableness in this culture so different to what they are used to.

And thats about it really. ""Dull"" doesnt seem to be a strong enough word, but perhaps i over anticipated due to the hype, so i am restraining myself from using the word ""drivel"" instead.",1118102400,8,963,4.522988505747127

1498916,2,B00005JMJ4,"Have you heard the story of ""The Emperor's New Clothes""? A long time ago, there lived an Emperor who was very rich and arrogant. He pampered himself and he loved expensive clothes. One day he ordered 2 tailors to sew him new attire to show off to the whole kingdom, and if he is unhappy with the clothes, he will execute them. Running out of time, the 2 tailors became scared and when the Emperor summoned them, they came and showed the Emperor ""air"" and claimed it was a special robe which only intelligent people can see. Of course, no one could see anything there but they didn't want to be labelled as stupid. So, everyone from the Emperor to his ministers said that they could see it and mentioned how beautiful it was. At last, the Emperor marched naked across his kingdom.

The reason I told that story is because I feel this movie is something like the clothes. There's nothing there, but people are making a big hoo-ha about it. Bare in mind though, it is not a particularly bad movie, but it isn't good either.

The story is set in Tokyo, a city bustling with life and color. Bob Harris is a Hollywood has-been who is in Tokyo filming some commercials. During his stay, he is in frequent contact with his wife who seems to rely on him to make petty decisions like picking the correct marble color etc. Meanwhile, young ""just married"" Charlotte is also in Tokyo with her husband, John. John is a photographer and is rarely in the hotel. That leaves Charlotte feeling lonely. She does however notice Bob in the hotel many times, and so does Bob. A friendship is formed between the both of them as they share some weird moments together. And so the story progresses...

I don't know, I tried to like this movie. I even watched it 3 times because I thought I missed something the first time I watched it. But it's just mediocre. I could barely sustain my interest in the movie. If it were half an hour longer, honestly I would've switched off my TV. I am someone very open-minded about movies and I even love artsy movies, but this movie does not offer anything special. The concept of the movie was interesting enough and as the movie was building up, I was waiting for something intelligent, something quirky, something different but unfortunately, it never came.

Bill Murray was basically playing himself in this movie, though not at his best. He basically sulks around looking pathetic. Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte did a good job, she's a talented actress and I have much respect for her but unfortunately, she can just do as much as the script allows her to. The screenplay which was written by Sofia Coppola, seemed too dry for my taste. I love intelligent dialogue, witty humour and sometimes just plain facts presented in an entertaining way, none of which I felt present in this movie. It really was  a surprise for me when she took home the Oscar for this category.

Well, as I said...this isn't a bad movie, but considering the attention and hype it got, suffice to say I was disappointed with it. In my opinion, it's an okay movie but just don't have high expectations of it. I wouldn't buy it, and to be honest I wouldn't even rent it. Good thing I have HBO.",1117843200,7,3182,4.525217391304348

1498918,5,B00005JMJ4,"Through a subtle story and script, a floaty and dreamlike cinematographical style, and the underlying theme of humour and love, this film captures the feeling of being ""lost"" - literally  and figuratively. ""Lost in Translation"" captures the essence of what the main characters are experiencing during their stay in Tokyo. The movie encourages viewers to feel as lost as John Harris (Bill Murray), an impatient and washed-up American actor who's lost touch with himself and his family, or relate to the lonely young twenty-something wife, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is intelligent yet unsure about what to do with her life and finds herself in Tokyo because she followed her young and energetic (yet lacking a certain depth) photographer husband on a business trip. John and Charlotte meet at the highly polished hotel they are both staying at and form a unique bond during their week in the impossibly foreign, overwhelmingly urban, hectic and dream-like surroundings of Tokyo. Each scene captures the essence of being both lost in one's surroundings and in one's self. The scenes are designed to embody the sometimes embarassing and funny things that can happen in an unfamiliar culture, or simply capture the powerful bond that Charlotte and John share during their time in Tokyo. No, it's not a romance between Charlotte and John, but they do form a certain love and deep understanding during their week's stay and both begin to find their way a bit easier after meeting each other. Murray and Johansson were a pleasure to watch in this film and very convincing when capturing the essence of the bond that their two characters share. Not to mention a subtle and cool soundtrack, a floaty cinematographic style, understated humour, and best of all, a sweet yet appropriate ending, this movie is certainly one of the best films of the year.",1117152000,8,1850,5.045751633986928

The scene at the hospital when Bill Murray is talking to an elderly Japanese man seems completely unrehearsed, natural and it worth watching the movie only for that.  The two Japanese ladies sitting behind them keep laughing, it is just great.  Bill Murray in the role of a slightly tired and jaded actor is beautiful.  Just beautiful.  By the way, I've never seen Bill Murray in anything that wasn't great.  I've heard he's ""difficult"" to work with, but is that a bad thing?  He does great work.  This movie is a delight.  Scarlett Johannsen is superb, the actor who plays her husband is a perfect young husband and the girl who plays the dumb action movie actress is a hoot.  Beautifully shot, beautifully paced.

This is one of the best movies I have seen in years, full of charm and insight, directed with a quirky but precise eye for detail. Wonderful performances. I can't recall who won the Oscar that year, but Bill Murray was clearly robbed. The karaoke scene begins with great humor (Murray singing Elvis Costello's WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT PEACE, LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING? while an incongruously idyllic scene plays on the screen) and moves into touching beauty (Murray serenading his lovely young companion with Roxy Music's MORE THAN THIS).

1499012,5,B00005JMJ4,"Surprisingly enough you can love this movie, without being an ""indie"" film person. It is (shocker!) possible to be effected by a movie just because you can relate to it. Not because magazines give it good reviews or what your friends think and quite obviously not what the people on Amazon think. Yes, it's true that most people my age (15) believe that a movie is good if

a) someone/something explodes

b) sex

c) is a senseless romantic comedy

Anyone who has ever felt lost or lonely can relate and enjoy this visually stunning movie. With Bill Murray in the lead he gives a truly Oscar worthy performance. As an aging actor who is more than a little sarcastic yet not beyond looking for human connection. In a city (Tokyo) he knows nothing about. That's where Scarlett comes in as a young, Yale graduate who's photographer husband practically ignores her. Both are in a foreign city, exacerbating their feelings of isolation and really the question of; what makes life worth living if it's so hard? does it get any easier?

They spend day after day with each other learning about Tokyo and the culture, but more importantly learning about each other and realizing that connection is not so hard with the right person. Although they know it cannot last as they both have to move on with their lives.

Yet the point of that movie is that although their relationship doesnt last forever, it doesnt mean it effects us any less. Sometimes such limitations make them even more important and the memory, the bridge lasts forever. Also, alleviating the feeling of loneliness as you now know that there is someone in the world that understands. The conclusion is excellent and makes that point.

What makes the movie so beautiful is that they have this relationship, beyond friendship but never sexual. When they're lying in bed, talking about life, you get the feeling of profound trust and mutual love. Something that most of us would be lucky to experience in our lifetime.",1116028800,11,1972,4.765395894428153
1499013,4,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray (Bob Harris) and Scarlett Johansen (Charlotte) are seperated by 25 years, but are both at the crossroads in their lives. With the setting in Tokyo, they meet as strangers and slowly explore each others problems, while formimg a special bond throughout the film.
Following these characters through Japan, they help each other out with their problems and become enamored with each other. The dialog and interactions of the cast, were well written and well scripted. It perfectly shows the characters wrestling with their problems, as they have a hard time adapting to being in Japan while trying to figure out how to get out of the rut in their lives.
It's very entertaining and works so well because Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen sell it so well. Without seeing the movie, it may not seem that the two of them would gel so well, but they do in a special way. By the end of the movie, you are totally sold on the story line, as well as the chemestry betwen the main characters.
It's a relaxing movie that allows you to sail away on the personal journies of the two main characters, feeling enlightned and satisfied at the end. This film was very well done, and should be appriciated as an example of the fact that you don't need a $100 Million dollar budget to make a great film.",1115942400,5,1293,4.577586206896552
1499014,1,B00005JMJ4,"I thought there was something there after I watched *Lost in Translation*.  It left me, of course, asking, ""Isn't there a point to this movie?""  I didn't exactly go out getting this movie with expectations (I bought it together in a pairing with *Eternal Sunshine*).  I had no interest in watching this movie before I got it.  I didn't really know what to expect.  I knew that Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola had been nominated for awards for it.  The only thing of the content that I knew of this movie before watching it was what a friend of mine had described to me: a scene where Bill Murray's character was listening to a translator translate Japanese into English, and long Japanese sentences were communicated in only a few words in English, while a few Japanese words were translated into novel-sized speeches.  The sad thing was that my friend's description of the joke was funnier than the actual manifestation of it on film.

Needless to say, I didn't receive this movie as well as my friend did.  But that's not to say I didn't get it, as many who claim to like this film will probably tell me.  Nor did I give it a superficial and impatient viewing, in case anyone wants to tell me that I should have looked more closely at the movie instead of wondering throughout why I didn't simply get a shot of morphine and save myself two hours of work.  I once thought I didn't get it after I had watched the film.  But then I asked around, asked other friends who had seen it.  I asked, ""Did I miss something?  What was the point of the movie?""  And the answers came back pretty much what every positive reviewer on here has said: ""The finding of good company even in a strange world,"" ""The solace one finds in another in loneliness,"" ""The charm and beauty in the subtleties of a non-sexual relationship,"" etc.

Well, they weren't telling me anything I hadn't known before.  And after a second viewing, they still hadn't told me anything I hadn't known before.  Essentially, I had already gotten it the first time, but I thought I didn't, because I was looking for more.  I was looking for a point that I thought was worth putting on the screen, instead of the ones I had confirmation for from so many others.  My confusion was in wondering, ""That can't be all to it, right?  No one would have laid down millions to make so much noise without anything to say, right?""  And instead of getting something more from the answers I received, I got explanations that would usually be the start of a premise.  And this is what this movie is: about two hours of shaky character development, and when the conflict, aside from Charlotte's getting upset over Bob's cheating on his wife with the lousy lounge singer instead of with her, is about to begin, the movie ends.

Actually, we can only assume that Bob didn't cheat on his wife with Charlotte, for the movie constantly hides transitional scenes from the viewer, and we can only assume certain things.  When Bob shows up to Charlotte's room for the first time, we must assume that she at some unknown point gave him her room number, for the camera never tells us.  And when Bob gives her a stuffed penguin at the hospital, we can only assume that Bob had bought it at a nearby gift shop or that someone else had given it to him.  We simply don't know.  One moment he's mocking an old Japanese man, and the next, the old man is gone, and Bob's holding a stuffed penguin.  Maybe the old man Bob was mocking transformed himself into the stuffed penguin.  We don't know.  The priorities of this film are haphazard.  Instead of showing Bob mocking the old Japanese man, Coppola could have used that time to show Bob procuring the penguin.  At least have him go to a gift shop and mock an old Japanese man there and fill in the missing transitional detail.  And while that detail may seem trivial, missing details such as what Charlotte and Bob might have done after the conversation they had in bed are not trivial, nor can they be assumed.  Did she stay the night?  If not, how did they depart?  If Charlotte did stay the night, what did they say to each other in the morning?  These are the very details a director must show us in order to give nuances to characters and explain motives and foreshadow decisions and actions later on.  Yet, the viewers must fill in these parts of the screenplay for themselves.

These missing details also leave the viewer wondering how the relationship between Charlotte and her husband will be (which would be much more interesting to explore).  It leaves the viewer wondering how Bob will reconcile his situation with his wife at home, which would also be much more interesting to watch.  But those questions don't seem to ever play into the movie--never in the psychology of the characters, even.  Throughout the movie, as the relationship between Charlotte and Bob develops, the two characters never once question what they're doing as it would pertain to their spouses.  The closest we get is Charlotte's briefly looking at some pictures of her husband, probably to wonder why she had married him.  For whatever reason, dewy-eyed romantics will gloss over all the structural and logical problems of this film to accept its context as not only justification but the starting point to root for the main characters to be unfaithful to their spouses, whether physically or emotionally.  So, instead of hoping that they can work out their problems with their respective spouses, we are supposed to be glad to see them fall for each other.  (And no, this relationship isn't purely platonic.  The ending refutes any claims that Bob and Charlotte intended this relationship to be purely platonic.)  This implicit goal to have the viewers root for the protagonists' infidelity is questionable at best.

The subtlety of the relationship between the two characters may be charming to watch (thanks mainly to Bill Murray's presence and the tension provided by our curiosity to see if they will do anything more than talk to each other), but the characters are never realistically fleshed out.  I'm sure that philosophy graduates from Yale do not listen to self-help tapes, nor do they regress into asking why the Japanese in the setting of Japan of all places would have trouble speaking English.  The question about *r*s and *l*s is especially puerile.  And I'm also sure that philosophy graduates from Yale would know enough to be able to take a step back from their problems, such as their sense of loneliness and alienation, to try to see the problems objectively and find a solution to those problems.  They don't merely seek shallow and short-term solutions, such as begging to be lavished with attention.  There may be many moments of slow-paced dialogue, but just because slow-paced dialogue is in direct contrast to flashy cutting and exploding cars does not automatically make characters and themes complex.  Nor should it automatically evoke the assumption that something is beautiful simply because it tests our patience.  I know the so-called art house audiences will find these facts hard to believe, since they believe that they are the only ones who truly get it and that the rest of the world doesn't--because it is imperative that anyone who does not get such things must like only slap-stick, nudity, and gratuitous violence.

The point, however, isn't whether the rest of us get it or not.  I got it.  I don't very much care for slap-stick, nudity, or gratuitous violence.  And I'm going to venture to guess that most of the people who saw the movie got it.  The answers given by my friends who liked the movie echoed my own guesses as to the point of this movie.  The reviews that many of those lathering praises upon praises on this movie echoed my guesses.  I understood that this movie was about desperately trying to find that connection in the context of alienation and all those other things.  It actually doesn't take great smarts to figure that out.  The question is: do I care?

Another reviewer here found this movie to be as pointless as *American Beauty*.  I am not sure how one can compare these two movies.  *American Beauty* actually tied everything together in the end.  The soliloquy in the end echoed a few things in the middle of the movie, giving those moments greater significance.  Yes, random things seemed to happen, but in the end, everything came together, and we go away with a poignant revelation of the beauty of all occurences, good or bad.  And all characters, be they looking to be liked, looking for power, looking to regain dignity, looking for love, they are all looked upon as beauty in the greater scheme of things.  In the end, I cared about the characters, the themes, the movie.

In *Lost in Translation*, we have none of that.  The two protagonists are self-absorbed, a bit spacey, and are just a little obnoxious in their sense of superiority over a different culture.  And yes, some of the stereotyping are offensive, but I don't really expect people to actually sense this unless they're Asian.  After all, the American identity is represented by the two superior characters in the film (who happen to be white).  They are the ones we are supposed to identify with.  So it's probably difficult for non-Asians to actually step out of that identity, once they're in it, to understand how offensive some of the portrayals of the Japanese were.  There are many people who say that Asians shouldn't be offended by the portrayals and thusly, and summarily, dismiss the complaint.  But I don't know what right those people have to dictate whether someone else should feel offended.  The person who is offended is the one with the right to claim offense.  It is irrelevant to the people feeling offended whether YOU are offended or not.  Ironically, those who claim that we don't ""get it"" in regards to the point of this movie don't seem to ""get it"" in regards to the racism in the movie.  (Perhaps they don't want to get it, lest it diminishes their chance to boast their appreciation for this movie.)  But just because YOU don't understand the context (in this case, being Asian) and therefore feel no offense doesn't mean that there is no valid offense to those who do understand that context.

And the claim that demeaning the Japanese is supposed to make the Americans seem awkward and crude (because we see the world from the Americans' point of view), therefore emphasizing Bob's and Charlotte's alienation, only contradicts the intention of the film.  If the audience is supposed to like these characters and care for them, we should hope that they are not awkward and crude; and that if they are, they would redeem themselves somehow for being bad guests in a foreign country.  But they never do redeem themselves for their supposed awkwardness or crudeness.  They never even attempt to learn anything about their surroundings.  The only redeeming quality in their racism (as is with all racism) is that sense of superiority that they instill in others who can identify with them.  It is the ONLY reason anyone can accept the racism of others.  The context of alienation could have been formed in a number of other ways, whether through peer group status, financial status, or social status.  But to pick ethnicity and exotic culture, especially with the foreign country as the milieu, as the focus of conflict of status is inevitably misguided and tasteless.  It doesn't matter if Coppola didn't intend her device to be a belittling, offensive one.  In the end, it is.  And to excuse it by saying it was incidental or it was an accident is just another way of saying that she was ignorant of what she was doing, for she didn't understand the culture with which she used to form the backdrop to the film.  And last I heard, calling someone ignorant for being racist is not a pardon but a condemnation.

But that's beside the point.  It is beside the point that this movie might be autobiographical.  It is beside the point that Sofia Coppola's father is legendary and influential director Francis Ford Coppola.  It is beside the point that this heavily improvised movie based upon a disjointed screenplay inexplicably won an Academy Award for best screenplay even though much of the crucial details of the movie and the whispered ending itself must be assumed by the viewers.  The point is that *Lost in Translation* lacks any meaning worth spending a couple of hours to watch.  And just because you say that you can appreciate that lack of a greater meaning and that you can take two hours out of life to witness and cry over the beauty in that lack of a greater meaning doesn't necessarily mean that you have a gifted and greater understanding of art or beauty, as many reviewers in the other camp would vehemently declare.  Again, the question isn't whether one gets the point of this movie.  The point is easily comprehensible.  It's sort of like asking, ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" and the reply comes back, ""To get to the other side.""  Well, we already knew that.  It's not profound or anything.  And that kind of humor might have worked the first time we heard it.  But since we've grown past such vapid and childish jokes long ago, the question again is: do I care?

The answer is no.",1115942400,19,13239,4.702867072111208
1499015,4,B00005JMJ4,"While Bill Murray will likely never be known as being a mega-successful actor in drama films, he takes another crack at it in this current movie.  He plays a beyond-middle-aged movie star who is getting paid millions to do advertisements for a Japanese whisky company.  Fittingly, they want to do the marketing work in Japan.

While there he comes across a lovely young 20-something girl (Scarlett Johansson) who is staying in his hotel.  The two kick off a highly unlikely friendship that is the centerpoint of the plot.  Both are married but a bit lonely in their relationships.  Both dislike Japan, but enjoy each others company.  From spending time together they begin to actually relish their time spent in the foreign land.

Having lived in Japan for a few years myself, I found the movie especially nostalgic.  I could relate to much of the culture shock depicted as I went through it myself.  There is nothing so helpless as being surrounded by people who do not speak the same language as you do.

To be sure, this is a film that meanders a bit.  It is not a tight, cohesive story.  Rather, it does leave some loose ends, basically offering speculations on final outcomes to the viewer of the DVD.  This is not necessarily bad, but a lot of people may not like it.  In short, the film is more in an impressionistic mode than a storytelling mode.

Surprisingly enough, the #1 reason to pick this movie up is the performance of Scarlett Johansson.  Her demure, subtle beauty & character steals the show away from the great Bill Murray.  She is so docile and seems so innocent that you will want to hug her!

Also, while I'm normally not a huge fan of Rock Videos in the bonus features, the one on this DVD did capture the essence of what the movie was ""about.""  It showed Ms. Johansson walking the streets of Tokyo in a daze that made me think of Lewis Carrol's ALICE IN WONDERLAND.

So, here is the bottom line:  if you like movies that depict Romantic (or pseudo-Romantic?) escapades to foreign lands, this one might be worth checking out.  It is well done and, like a good song, difficult to get out of your head after you've seen it.",1115769600,5,2144,4.554973821989528

In my opinion, it's not the masterpiece that everybody's making it out to be. It's simpliness, and the fact that it doesn't have to be a spectacular, high-budget, adventure movie is brilliant - and a real change from the usual movies at the moment. But there was something missing, something missing that would make this a GREAT movie..

And of course this is how the film is marketed...as a  tale of unexpected friendship.  But while almost everyone concentrates on this aspect of the film they are being bombarded with a subtle but profoundly conservative message.  Namely that what we call pop-culture and/or consumerism is alien and something to be avoided and overcome. The vapid actress, the wanna-be white rapper, the strip club, the photo shoot, the loose lounge singer...all of these things represent different aspects of our hedonistic culture to one degree or another.  Murray's and Johansson's reactions when confronted with these alien phenomena are instructive.  Johansson can barely contain her contempt while Murray just seems worn out by it all. The look on Johansson's face when she talks with the wanna-be rapper is priceless.

The fact that the two are in Japan is meaningless (except for marketing of course). While it is comical, Japan (with its embrace of western culture) is simply a proxy for the west in this film.

Instead we get semi-Ugly Americans who are too wrapped up in themselves to even try to become immersed in anything more challenging or edifying than lizard-y lounges and karaoke/sushi bars. The Bill Murray character is damn LUCKY to be offered millions to do a commercial in Tokyo, since he seemed like a has-been third-rate actor hardly worth the airfare. Nevertheless, he is caught up in his own pity party. The Scarlett Johansson character has at least the excuse of youthfulness to rationalize her less-than-sophisticated pursuits. She seems refined and intelligent on one hand, yet makes rash choices (husband, Murray) on the other. That sort of impulsive poor judgement doesn't bode well for her, not that this movie made me care.

1499130,5,B00005JMJ4,"Ever since this film was released I've observed people arguing about its value.  Frankly, none of it mattered to me that much.  I was curious to see what the fuss was about, but not really that motivated to actually go and see ""Lost"" in the theater or even rent it for that matter.

Now, after seeing this film, I am fascinated by not just the movie, but also all these negative reviews!

Most movies give you two hours which are a super hyper-condensed version of reality.  In many cases this creates an absurd pacing.  Humans and events just don't evolve that quickly.  But audiences, particularly here in the US, demand immediate emotional satisfaction.  The boy always gets the girl, the Americans always win the battle, the bad guy always loses, etc. etc.  This kind of plot and pacing is not just unrealistic, it's absolutely monotonous.  So many movies in the US are just the same thing over and over and over.

And then a movie like ""Lost in Translation"" comes along.  Coppola slows the pacing so that it's more realistic. She refuses to pander to the expectations of an American audience.  She wants to show us what it actually feels like to be an observer in another country that you don't understand.  To add to the realism and surrealism she throws in multiple characters who are also having the same experience.  All of this is the context surrounding an unconsummated love between a younger woman and an older man.

I'm more saddened than amazed at the hostility towards this film.  To understand ""Lost"" you need to empathize with the characters.  You need to know that uneasy sense of alienation when you're in another country and don't a have a clue about what's going on around you.  More importantly, you need to know what it's like to be committed to someone else and meet another person you would really really like to get to know under different circumstances.

Most Americans don't even have passports.  More and more, Americans on all sides of the political spectrum demand news and media that conform to their point of view.  Empathy has become a rare commodity.  All of this, it seems, results in a lot of people just not getting a movie like ""Lost.""  Something is wrong with American audiences - something wrong with their psyches, their expectations and their sense of humanity - if they feel they have to hate this movie.",1114646400,5,2349,4.700980392156863
1499131,2,B00005JMJ4,"I'll try to make this review short but NOT sweet:

Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) are two Americans in Tokyo, Japan.  They are bored, somewhat depressed and unable to sleep.  They meet and become friends.  That's basically it.  The dialogue is boring.  The acting is boring.  The plot is boring.  The scenery of Japan is interesting to look at.  There were some (few) funny situations and lines in the movie but not enough to recommend this movie.  Scarlett Johansson does a good acting job with her character with what little she has to work with (lack of great dialogue and script).  But Bill Murray is NOT a good actor.  Bill Murray played himself in this movie.  How anybody could think he deserved to win a Golden Globe, be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor is beyond my comprehension.  Bill Murray should not be rewarded for playing himself in a movie.  The movie did not deserve to be nominated for Best Picture (Academy Award) and did not deserve to win Best Comedy (Golden Globe).  What happened to the film industry?  Have they lost touch with reality?  I actually had to force myself to finish watching this movie and could not wait until it was over.  That's not a good sign.  If you are the ""arty"" (art-house) type, you will probably like this movie.  But if you are an average/mainstream movie viewer, you probably won't like this movie unless you like boring, quirky films.  I am shocked that this movie has been given so much praise and rave reviews from a lot of critics.  I guess that's why I like this website because I think it can be a more accurate viewpoint for people with all kinds of different tastes.

Just because a movie is considered a work of ""art"" doesn't mean it is appealing in any way or interesting enough to be a movie. It seems to me that this is becoming a trend now to make movies without anything really interesting going on.  It should at LEAST be interesting and maybe have something to say or have an impact on you in some way that you can't forget it.  I guess I put a lot of importance on a movie being interesting or entertaining so that I don't fall asleep.  Entertainment value is definitely very subjective and everybody has his or her own tastes.  I think it is VERY IMPORTANT to any movie to be interesting or entertaining enough that you would actually want to watch the movie again sometime.  I think most people would agree with me too.  This movie is NOT a great movie; not even a good movie.  Someone would have to pay me to watch this boring and irritating movie again.  I'd have to think about how much I'd charge.

Bob is bitter about the fact that he decided to go for the easy money in Japan instead of doing something more rewarding for his career, like a play. During his stay at a Tokyo hotel, Harris befriends Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a 25-year-old girl who's just as lost as he is. Charlotte is in Tokyo with her photographer husband who has no time to spend with her. Despite their age difference, Bob and Charlotte share a connection unlike anything either of them have experienced before.

1499134,4,B00005JMJ4,"I enjoyed Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" and would recommend the film to those who have lived abroad, especially in Japan.

The story involved Bill Murray's character, a washed-up actor in Tokyo to film a Suntory whiskey commercial for $2 million, and his bouts with insomnia, loneliness and questioning of his mid-life existence. He meets another lost soul, played by the up-and-coming actress Scarlett Johansen, and they have a brief, chaste, yet intimate friendship. She's stuck in the hotel where they are living while her photographer husband is out working.

Much of the action takes place in their upscale Tokyo hotel, but there are some interesting scenes in surreal bars, clubs, apartments, karaoke boxes and a hospital.

Having lived in Japan, I found that Coppola captured much of the intitial culture shock experienced by those new to the country. There is the dazzle of neon lights, indecipherable language, and over-stimulation of music, noise and hordes of people.

I found the range of characters and their English language abilities to be fairly accurate, although I think the doctor at the hospital might have had a better understanding.

If you're expecting a fast-paced film full of action and humor, this may not be the film for you. It is a subtle, nuanced, deliberate tale, with lots of lingering shots of details and on the characters looking out windows and thinking. It is definitely ""directed"" but I think that Coppola did an effective job. Murray's performance, against type, was also outstanding. Johansen has an engaging smile.

I haven't read any other reviews, but I imagine that if one hasn't experienced what these characters are going through, you just might not get it. Hence the warning above.",1113177600,8,1737,5.120141342756184

I had difficulty identifying with characters that were self-centered at best, downright creepy at worst.  These people are in one of the greatest cities in the world, with tons of sites to see and real Japanese people to get to know, but instead of going out and taking advantage of a travel opportunity that few Americans have, they hang out in a hotel bar and seek out the one other white person around, even though that other person is a fairly questionable choice of company.  In real life, if a not-very-attractive 50-year-old man sitting alone in a bar was staring at a 20-year old woman, she would run away.  But in the weird universe of this movie, he is supposed to be not creepy, and the audience is supposed to sympathize with their little platonic (we hope) love affair.  Besides watching their sketchy lives progress, very little actually happens in the film to keep your attention, besides a little comedy in the beginning that soon fizzles out into boring scene after boring scene.  And Japanese friends of mine find the comedy offensive, so maybe that isn't to be enjoyed either.  I felt the whole movie was trying to make some deep point about life, but I just didn't get it because I felt the lives of this weird self-centered girl and creepy man in a mid-life crisis had nothing to do with my life.",1113004800,9,1446,4.5346153846153845
1499136,3,B00005JMJ4,"First off, I am a Japanese and I don't think this is a racist movie. This is just a comment to who say it is.

If you ask me, I would say this movie is actualy a good one, certainly well above average. However, I feel like I need to explain why this movie does not work for some Japanese people (although I may not be a good representative as I have been living in US for almost 10 years.)

Some people say that this movie is about two Americans getting lost and lonely in some totally unfamiliar and mysterious place, and Tokyo is a perfect place for that as a background. This is a good observation I completely agree with. But this is EXACTLY WHY this movie does not work for some Japanese.

Tokyo was chosen exactly because it is a place where two americans can be naturally alienated more than any other place in the world. The background of this movie cannot be just some unfamiliar place. If it is some isolated island outside of civilization, then the story would become more like an adventure story. The place where this stoly is told needs to be at least as modern as major cities in US so that Americans may regularly visit for business reason, but at the same time totally different from any US or western cities in terms of culture and language. An implication of this is that this movie cannot have the same effect on Japanese people as it has on western audience, because Japan is not such a mysterious place to Japanese themselves, or maybe East Asians more broadly.

Living in US for many years, I understand that this movie portraits a very real feeling some Americans would have while visiting Japan, and I even share that same feeling to some extent. But this movie is walking a thin line here. The very concept of this movie makes it necessary to focus on and emphasize particular aspects of life in Japan that makes Americans feel more lonely and alienated. (However, I have to add that Sofia Coppola's description of such slice of life in contemporary Japan is very realistic. No other (western) movie is even close in this regard. This should be due to her frequent visit to Japan). That makes some Japanese feel that they are regarded as overly mysterious people, although there is no bad intention here (and the director even pays some respect to Japanese culture). So it is no surprise that some Japanese may be slightly ""offended"" by this movie, isn't it?",1112745600,7,2383,4.522041763341067

Although normally a comedy actor Bill Murray presents his character of Bob with such endearment, and again the audience can feel his worries of life and the 'what next' he and Charlotte are going through.

Anywho. First thing's first - actually, I really only have one thing to put across. So first thing's last. Lost In Translation is NOT a racist film. I don't understand all these reviews. Did I see some kind of special director's cut? Hmmm...

Well, what the heck. I'll point out a few things. Mwahaha.

1. PC people will always label you `racist' if you enquire into the idiosyncrasies of other cultures etc...They'd be much happier if you portrayed these people [in this case the Japanese] as vacuous husks.

2. Charlotte often complains about not being able to `feel' or `connect' with something [i.e. after she visits a temple/shrine; sees a number of sites etc.] The Japanese come across as culturally alive [e.g. when Charlotte slips into a room and observes the women arranging flowers etc. & they show her how it's done etc]. Yes, Bob & Charlotte are numb.

3. Don't get me started on Bob's wife and Charlotte's husband. Yeah. Yeah. This is a pro-American racist film [sorry about being so blunt].

4. Oh, and that ditzy American actress [she uses the pseudonym Evelyn Waugh]... Need I say more?

5.  I really wanna visit Japan now.

6.  By the way, I'm aware that even if a film portrays Americans as idiots it can still be racist. So don't bother pointing that one out. I just think Ms. Coppola's done a fab job here.

And there's stacks more - I just can't be bothered. Me brain's too small. Mwahahaha. Silly Ms. Coppola. Why did you have to make such an even-handed, beautiful film? Shame on you. Shame on your family. How dare you sixty minutes!

which brings me to one of the things i loved about this movie...the character development is fantastic. i seldom watch movies becasue i find many to be one-dimensional, transparent, and shallow. these charaters do not talk too much. when they talk, they have something to say and it is usually gives teh viewer an insight to who they (the character) are.

along that vein, there is not excessive dialogue in this movie. the dialogue is well placed and thoughtful. the music score and visual cinematography contribute to make a beautiful and flowing movie.

so, while yes, this movie is ""slow"", it is pleasantly slow...not at all painstaking for me to watch. in fact, after i saw it the first time, i wanted to immediately watch it again but did not due to the fact that it was 1am.

as for the anti-japanese opinions expressed on the reviews, i saw none. japan is a very different culture from ours and, as another reviewer stated, for this film to work these characters really need to be strangers in a strange land. what could be mistaken for japan-bashing is really just empahsis on the differences in cultures and societies. nothing in the film should be taken as degrading or insulting to the japanese culture. in fact, the film portrays japan and tokyo beautifully and makes me want to visit the land and the people, something i never really cared to do before seeing this film.

1499253,5,B00005JMJ4,"I watched this movie once, several months ago. I'm writing this review more about the impact the film left on me over time, rather than an immediate impression.

Several reviewers call this a racist movie that belittles Japanese. I disagree. This movie isn't about Japan or about the Japanese people. It is about two Americans who are lost in a place where nothing is familiar so they are forced to confront their own problems and loneliness because there is nothing else for them to do. This story had to be made in a foreign place, and it could have been Tokyo, or it could have been Bombay, Bangkok or Madrid. But I understand the choice of Japan. The location needed to be where few speak English and where the culture is unfamiliar to the characters and most of the audience. If you put these two characters in a hotel in New York or Chicago they wouldn't have come together. They are so unalike that they had to be in a place where merely being American and lonely was enough to bring them together.

This is a story about two people in a foreign place who are in no position to cope with their unfamiliar environs. That has less to do with who or where they are than the stages of life they are in. Bob is entering a classic mid-life crisis where his career is declining and he's losing touch with his family. Charlotte is young and newly married and is coming to grips with her new identity as the wife of a photographer who has little time or attention to give her and seems to have lost interest in her. They are struggling to find their own identities in times of transition. That's hard enough to do in comfortable, familiar surroundings, but transporting them to this crowded city of strange voices, smells, sounds and bright lights just amplifies their loneliness.

Put these two characters in a US city and they'll find refuge in a bar, a movie theater,a book store, a museum, a ballgame or whatever. But put them in Tokyo and they are lost. They are not in a position to learn or appreciate the new and rich culture that surrounds them. They are looking for distraction and comfort but instead they find themselves feeling lost and out of place.

So Coppola's treatment of Japanese characters isn't racist or demeaning. It is just a plot device used to emphasise how Charlotte and Bob are feeling.

I found the story and characters very moving. It is deliberately paced slowly and is shot and scored to give it a dreamlike quality. It is a story of an unlikely friendship in an unfamiliar place, yet the story is so direct and human that it feels familiar.

This movie isn't everyone's cup of tea. Action film fans should look elsewhere, as should fans of slapstick comedy. This subtle film needs to be given space to seep into your pores and transport you. The impatient and inattentive need not apply.",1111363200,4,2819,4.550295857988166
1499254,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost In Translation

 She is young, cute, and outgoing. He is married, successful, and unhappy. Together Bob Harris-played by Bill Murray and Charlotte-played by Scarlet Johansson, make up the dynamic duo in the film Lost In Translation. Directed by Sofia Coppola in 2003, the drama/comedy is stunning and full of flavor with the help of the vibrant city of Tokyo, Japan. As a great friendship evolves into something that some of us would simply envy, Bill Murray and Scarlet Johanson deliver award-winning performances as the fun loving characters Bob and Charlotte with the help of a great musical score and creative filming techniques.

 Bob's life is no more exciting than watching paint dry. Going through a mid-life crisis, the film opens with him receiving a message from his wife saying that he has forgotten his son's birthday. We see early on that Bob has lost touch with those close to him. With his television career going down the drain, Bob seems lost within his own world, which makes great reference to the films title.  His run-down battery is instantly re-charged when his eyes fall upon Charlotte while on a crowded elevator. Just seeing Charlotte for the first time Bob's eyes are fixed, almost in a daze, on no one but her. Once they meet and hang out some, something in Charlotte inspires Bob.  However when Bob reaches out to his wife via phone, she only pushes him away by assuming something is wrong with him. It would be safe to assume that Bob wanted to perhaps take the first step towards changing his relationship with his wife, but he hangs up regretting he ever called.

 Charlotte on the other hand is not as alone. She seems to seek peace within herself since her husband is so occupied with work. As Charlotte searches for a new outlook on life, she also re-evaluates her marriage to her workaholic photographer husband. Early in the film Charlotte visits a temple of worship. Later, when she calls a friend to talk, it's only obvious that something is bothering her, but her friend doesn't notice. Charlotte hangs up the phone and begins to cry silently to herself. Recently graduating from Yale in Philosophy, Charlotte is going through a quarter-life crisis. Her concerns seem to be with her direction in life. Although several years younger than Bob, Charlotte is too looking for a new lease on life. She listens to self-motivating tapes, and is unsure what she wants to do with her career when Bob inquires.  Charlotte's witty, intellectual personality sets the stage for Bob's sarcastic, yet almost empty personality. Their uneventful lives end when they begin spending lonely evenings together and hanging out with friends together.

 Overall, the film is a great feel good movie. However, disappointing to me was the absence of a love scene between Bob and Charlotte. Understanding that both of their characters are married, I did not see why their relationship could not have included a love scene or continued beyond Tokyo. I guess it is morally wrong to suggest a love scene, but a small one seemed appropriate. In the film, Bob ends up sleeping with the lounge singer. I thought the story would have tickled more fancies had there been a love scene between Bob and Charlotte instead. If their connection were so powerful to the point that they did not even introduce themselves to each other, a small physical scene between them would not have killed the movie. On the other hand, I suppose it is the genuine connection between the two that give the film its eloquent status.

 Even without a love scene, the music used in the film is what set precedence throughout the film. From the beginning, as Bob awakens in his cab to see the vibrant and colorful city of Tokyo, the angelic music sets the melodramatic tone of the film. Complementary and atmospheric, the music plays a major role in the film. The music is a part of the film and not just used during brief intermissions or to pass time. The music was more than just a great score. It helped create and to generate the audiences emotions. As Charlotte gets on the train to visit the temple, the soft-rock playing lightly in the background represents how she is feeling at the time, upbeat and feel good. Then as she enters the temple, the soft-rock is faded-over with bell dongs, the beat of drums, and chanting from the monks. Lastly, the soft piano playing in the bar, as Bob and Charlotte poetically connect, is another example of the music complementing the films content. The music altogether complemented the films characters, content, and filming style.

 Positively, the most creative and artistic part of the film was Coppola's use of Tokyo's decorative and magnificent city lights. The technique of filming outside of a cars' window to see the reflecting lights on the window is a stunning technique that Coppola utilizes more than once in the film. I particularly enjoy those shots, because it is the city and its color that enhances the films overall character. The massive city, bright lights, and great crowds of people, demonstrates how being lost in translation can simply mean more than a simple breakdown in communication.

 Rolling Stone magazine says, ""Don't stall on seeing Sofia Coppola's altogether remarkable film"", and I must agree. Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation is fresh, unique, and honestly refreshing. Steering away from the traditional romantic comedies, the relationship between Bob and Charlotte is so instantaneous you seem to forget important things about them. You forget that they are both married. You forget the differences in their ages. The only thing that does seem to be important is the fact that the two of them find great companionship while lost in translation.

The movie goes nowhere and ends the same way.the movie had the potential of giving Bill Murrary something to do but instead it focus' less on the charachters and more on the art school visual que's. For me its all mostly about the charachters and plot. this one seems lacking in both",1111104000,5,903,4.4787878787878785
1499257,5,B00005JMJ4,"When I went to see this film I was expecting, based on the preview, some crazy caper movie, like Bill Murray's previous duck-out-of-water movie ""The Man Who Knew Too Little."" I love that kind of film so I was quite looking forward to a little simple-minded fun. What I got instead was far from what I expected, but considerably more than I could have hoped for.

What I got was a film that truly moved me - for reasons inexplicable to me at the time. What I got was a beautiful visual experience, that left me feeling as if I was actually in the film (a feeling I've never had before with a film). What I got was a story about two characters that I felt I could really relate to and understand on a much closer level than I have seen in other films. What I got was a sense of having seen something truly magical, and when I left the cinema, I felt that I had to see it again. And I did.

I've always liked Bill Murray in almost any role he has been in, but he outshone himself this time. Not since ""The Razor's Edge"" have I seen him display so well that he is not just a comedian but an ACTOR of quite considerable talent. There was one scene at the end of the film that particularly demonstrated this. The look on his character's face as he watched his friend Charlotte walking away conveyed so much emotional meaning that I could have sworn I was feeling it too. That part of the film alone was worth seeing and it was only one brilliant scene among many.

A lot of reviewers have complained that the film lacked a plot and was ""boring."" I think they missed the point. The plot was in the emotions and the experiences. This was a film about two people lost in a strange place and lost in their own lives. It was a film about developing a special bond with another person that was far more important than any romance could produce. The plot was in the characters. There are no disasters to avert, treasures to find, bombs to defuse or crooks to catch. It was a story that could happen to anyone. Maybe that's one of the reasons why it is so easy to connect with.

I would remind people that there are plenty of stories  out there that are classics in which the plot is not so obvious. Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"" is the perfect example of a story in which there is virtually no overt plot, yet a considerable amount of action is occurring at levels other than those of action. The same could be said for ""Lost In Translation.""

Yes, sad to say there are no epic gun battles, sword fights, vampires, computer generated effects or fart jokes in this film. There are no cute little Hobbits to root for. Too bad. If you want fart jokes, catch something by Adam Sandler and such. If you want sword fights and Hobbits, watch the ""Lord of the Rings"" and other such dreck. ""Lost In Translation"" is not a film for everyone. But if you are interested in films where the characters are more important than the effects (e.g., ""Sideways"") then ""Lost In Translation"" will be perfect for you.

And one last point. I agree fully with Clint Eastwood when he said that the Oscars were ""Hobbitised"" that year. I cannot understand how films such as ""Lost In Translation"" or ""Mystic River"" could be beaten by an overblown and ultimately empty effects display like ""Return of the King.""",1111104000,8,3270,4.350819672131148
1499378,5,B00005JMJ4,"I cried a bit of tears at the romanticism captured and portrayed in the movie

I laughed my tail off. Bill Murray has never let me down with his brand of comedy

I must of reviewd the scene where the Japanese guy director says something in his tone of his voice and it's in English. and Bill Murray ( Harris) is having trouble trying to understand what he's saying

Anna Faris is in this movie

she's great in the Scary Movie Legacy movies. she's also great from Married With Children on 1 or 2 episodes. this is where she first started acting. on tv. then into films. Way to go Anna. I hope that the director, actors and actresses get awards for this movie

it's very touching

very sweet

very funny

and very interesting

I never thought getting lost could be so funny til now

I loved the trailer for it

and when I bought this on dvd

it's sooooooooooo worth being in my collection of love comedies ifyou will

if you like Bill Murray see: Groundhog Day, Stripes, Ghostbusters 1 &2, Space Jam, They man who knew too little, Scrooged, and other great movies he's timeless in comedy in

I loved watching this on my dvd player and when I""m in my 90s. I can see myself still being touched and laughing at this great cinematic experience of love and humor put to the movie screen. Great job everyone who contributed to this movie

The scenes and scenery are simply amazing

I could watch this again and again whenever I can get the time to watch my movies.and still laugh and cry.

The director is a genious.",1111104000,2,1508,4.366906474820144
1499379,5,B00005JMJ4,"...and that's what I think I liked best about it.  Some complain that there is no plot and no jokes, yet wonder why so many of us like it enough to give it 5-stars (or offer it so many Academy Awards). The truth is what makes this movie such a gem is that it doesn't need to come out and smack you in the head with the type of dull, predicatable nonesense like most movies do these days.  It reminds me of older films; not in content or style, necessarily, but in its honest simplicity.  Why is it funny?  Not because its a constant joke machine, but because its just the opposite.  Does someone need to fall down, curse, get hurt, or otherwise make a fool out of themselves in order to be funny?  Well, to most people yes.  The reason why this movie is so funny is the same reason certain scenes in Casablanca are so funny, despite the seriousness of that film's subject: dialogue.  Because I haven't watched the movie lately, I'll leave it at that, and asure most of you that if you just relax and don't expect to see slapstick or stupid voices or people acting foolish, you might actually enjoy a movie that is funny in its simplicity.

Another thing worth mentioning is Bill Murray's performance.  Many people, including critics who enjoyed the film, thought that Murray's Oscar nomination was unwarrented; that he was simply ""being"" Bill Murry.  That's like saying (to use the Casablanca reference again) that Bogey was just being himself and didn't have to act to be Rick Blaine.  I strongly disagree.  Murray's performance isn't in your face like most of his, or other actor's , performances.  True, he doesn't really have to ""become"" anyone, but he still has to act.  He has to be convincingly lonely, upset, tired, and frustrated, all the while being funny.  He doesn't just do it, it does it better than most actors could.  I'd hate to see Sean Penn try that, or even Jaime Fox a great actor, but when he does ""funny"" he can only seem to do a certain kind of in-your-face funny...that's not what this movie needed, and thank God thats not what it tried to do.

Finally, the script.  Like its humor, its simply good, and charming.  All it asks of us is to give up two hours to watch to lonely Americans who find themselves in the same place, waiting for things to happen.  In the end, they become great friends and they decide to go out and make things happen. It doesn't need a caper of any kind. It doens't need explosions or any kind of love affair.  This is a character driven Comedic-Drama (or Dramatic-Comedy) and the chemistry between the Murray and Johansen is perfect.  I can't wait to see this movie again.",1110412800,8,2625,4.491561181434599

In Lost in Translation, it can very much attract the predicaments for foreigners.  (say if you understand what the Suntory director said in Japanese).  But what really attracts me its the relationship between Bob (Bill) and Charlotte (Scarlett).  They both are great actor/actress, their encounter is always sexy, but never explicit.  Only with a good script and a good director that such a shy relationship can be portraited in such a powerful way.

As in the interview Scarlett said, this is a character-driven movie, you don't even need a story, all it takes is superb acting plus superb script and superb direction.  The chemistry is movie.",1110240000,,863,4.979020979020979

Whoever gives 5 stars rating for this movie must be lying, or need to check their heads. From the beginning of the movie to the end, it was so boring, jokes were not really jokes. In fact, to me it is more like making fun of the Japanese culture and the Japanese people. Oh, we are Americans, we come to Japan, we see your city is crowded, hotel room is too small, shower is too short, walk around I get bumped into a cabinet, my toe turned black but Japanese love black toe, we see doctor for that, don't need to fill out any form at the hospital. Or go to strip club, watch strippers tease and comment them as they were learning how to dance. Or go to restaurant, make an order, but demand a beer, and the food was terrible. Turn on the TV, nothing but some crappy kiddy shows. Japanese teenagers look stupid and play kiddy games. Singer or band from America that really don't know how to sing, but the Japanese love them. Why do Japanese exercise, work out in the pool? Why don't they just jump in and swim like me? Or visit temple, but have no feeling like Japan doesn't have church. Firealarm goes off at midnight while people at sleep like it never happend in America. Every scene in the movie is about insulting Japanese. 5 stars rating must be meant for a movie made to disrespect the Japanese people and their culture.

Bill Murray has always been an interesting choice to star in movies that don't sport a hard-core comedy theme, but he is seemless in this movie.

I wish I had more time to work on this review (my apologies, as the movie truly deserves serious accolades) but again, if you had any interest in either of the two movies above, then you should have no problem grooving to this slow-burn beat.

Old guy meets young woman, have a few nights out in the neon lights of Tokyo, go their separate ways. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is that! Oh yes, the film buffs out there will tell you all about its gentle charm, its understated yet magnificent acting and its heart-warming character development but these are merely the psychological yearnings of the weak-minded. That's what happens when you're bored to tears. You imagine greatness in mediocrity. You long to see Bill Murray return as a major star, but try to forget that what you're watching isn't the best vehicle for that. What happened with Lost in Translation was that a poor script and poor idea for a film made it into production on the basis of the director's daddy. The end result isn't all that interesting, is entirely pointless (and no buffs, the point wasn't the pointlessness, but sure, delude yourselves into believing that if you're happy), has no deep insights and drags on for minute after agonising, painful minute. Buy the DVD, then burn it because the pretty colours will be more exciting.",1109635200,20,1207,4.835748792270532
1499384,4,B00005JMJ4,"Loneliness is one of the most basic human emotions; when experiencing it, some people will reach out to others who understand that feeling. That sentiment seems to be at the heart of ""Lost in Translation,"" a film that straddles the line between odd love story and a look at loneliness and isolation.

Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a middle-aged actor with a faded career. Currently he's alone in Japan, filming a commercial, and feels lonely and alienated despite the luxurious surroundings and royal treatment. He catches glimpses of a pretty young blonde, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who intrigues him.

She is equally bored and lonely, and at loose ends since her husband is away working. The two finally meet over drinks, and begin to bond and explore the city of Tokyo. Bob is in a downtempo midlife crisis, while Charlotte is unsure what to do with her life. And they both learn that they have things to teach one another...

A small warning: ""Lost in Translation"" has very little plot. And yes, it can be pretentious at times, sometimes politically incorrect. Fortunately, Sofia Coppola's second full-length film has qualities to make up for its improvised plot, with the beautiful cinematography, good direction and outstanding acting by its two main leads. It's a movie that requires patience and slow unfolding.

Loneliness is the theme of this movie. Particularly, it's the loneliness of the soul -- Charlotte and Bob are surrounded by people, yet they feel alone. Hanging out together alleviates their loneliness for a little while, even though their problems won't go away. As a result, some parts of it can feel hollow. But at the same time, it gives the film a more realistic feeling -- often people in such situations DON'T deal with it.

In keeping with the theme, Coppola keeps the movie slow and pensive, with plenty of beautiful cinematography and exquisite shots of Tokyo. The entire film has a slightly shadowy, glowing look. And the quiet dialogue has a witty, acerbic edge, such as when dizzy blonde Kelly announces ""I'm under Evelyn Waugh,"" only to have Charlotte inform her that, ""Evelyn Waugh was a man.""

Bill Murray rules this film, with his understated expressions and world-weary attitude. It's surprising that someone could act so blase, and yet be strangely charming. Scarlett Johansson proves that she is no longer just another child star, with a solid performance that stacks up well beside veteran Murray's.

Strange, slow and pensive, this is a film that takes some getting used to; it may even take multiple viewings to fully ""get."" Just soak it in, and see how you like it.",1109548800,,2614,4.954337899543379
1499385,3,B00005JMJ4,"If you make a film about bored people, the result is obviously a boring film. And this film is boring, but very beautiful. This film moves you from one side to another. Soon you feel you are going to fall asleep, soon the scene makes your heart tremble.

Well, that is life. In the strange and even unreal atmosphere of Tokyo, karaoke and game machines we have two not so unreal characters (the young wife of a workaholic photographer and a middle-age almost retired actor who is devoted to whisky advertisements). But what is not unreal is what happen to them. We find really hyper-realistic scenes.

Could it happen to you? Of course. To be lost in a strange city in which you have to go for business of any matters is something you (and of course me) can feel. And the only thing you need is human touch, moreover, human presence. It is the necessity of talk about whatever and going anywhere with somebody.

The characters are against all that surrounds them except from themselves. The ambient is hostile, and the global feeling is anti-Japanese, anti-karaoke and anti-neon lights. But they find what they need in themselves and soon the city is the cloak they need to hide in.

Making a film about boredom leads you to unsuccess, even if you treat the story pleasantly and elegantly. So, the final rate must be in the middle. 1 for the story itself. 5 for the development. 3 is the mean...",1109548800,7,1395,4.568
1499386,4,B00005JMJ4,"I had an opportunity to finally watch Lost in Translation last weekend. The movie came out in 2003, in the fall, and I remember many folks treating it as a big deal at the time. Well, I did enjoy the movie, but not in that ""big deal"" way. It's an artsy movie that I would best classify as a set piece. You could go with the ""often brilliantly executed artistic or literary work characterized by a formal pattern"" definition, or the ""situation, activity, or speech planned beforehand and carried out according to a prescribed pattern or formula"" definition...either way, ""set piece"" is an accurate description of a movie which is so dependent on character and setting, and not so much on plot. Tokyo acts as a crucible by which Bob and Charlotte get to know each other, and they each experience epiphanies as to the nature of their current relationships, but in the end nothing in either of the lives truly changes. Their time together is sweet, and it is nice to watch their relationship grow, and you are left with the impression that they ""will always have Tokyo"".

The movie reminded me a bit of the work of James Joyce. I know many are big fans of his work, but others, like myself, consider Joyce to be the ""Catastrophe of 20th Century Literature"". I would characterize his work the same way I characterize this movie: set pieces, with plot subsumed beneath character and setting, with epiphanies replacing climax and with little in the way of thematic structure and thrust. Don't get me wrong, I'm not equating the movie to Joyce...I'm just trying to illustrate my meaning.

Bill Murray turns in a good performance...a believable portrayal of an aging actor. Scarlett Johannson does a good job as well. However, neither actor has to stretch in their roles...that's not the point of this style of movie. Bill Murray's best work, in my opinion, still has to be Groundhog Day. The movie was shot on location in Tokyo, and I recognized many places I'd passed through on my trips to that city.

So, it's an enjoyable movie, but I guess I'm a bigger fan of more plot-driven movies, with a climax to the story. Likely worth a rental.",1109289600,,2132,4.664893617021277
1499387,1,B00005JMJ4,"This movie could have been so much better if it had avoided the absurd portrayal of Japanese people. That wasn't good and hurts the film in the long run. Yes, I  can relate to the loneliness of these two characters and finding someone to share that with. Everyone at one point or another has felt lost at certain times in his or her life, highschool, young adulthood, relationships, mid-life identity crises...the list goes on and on, but I couldn't understand why these two characters were so weak, especially since they are unhappy with thier lives in America, wouldn't it make sense that they be interested in alternative lifestyles? It wasn't believable that two people in an interesting foreign country would be so fridgid about experiencing the different culture there unless they were snobs.  It's a shame that we don't get to see what happens when they get back to America and how they deal with their problems there. That would be a very interesting movie.",1109203200,12,965,4.842424242424243
1499517,4,B00005JMJ4,"What category did it fall into? I absolutely loved it! Despite being told that I might not, and to indulge in some alcohol. I left out the alcohol, and found myself really enjoying the movie.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, and I groaned when the opening shot was of Scarlett Johansson's butt in a pair of dreadful pink see-through panties. She is now hated by every woman, and loved by every man. Scarlett said that she was reluctant to be filmed in panties until Sofia Coppola modelled the panties herself to show that they would look horrible. The opening shot of Scarlett is actually influenced by a painting by John Kacere, which shows up later in the hotel.

Bill Murray is a master at everything he does (except Caddyshack - don't start!), and my favourite movie up until seeing this was Groundhog Day. He's an older, subtler version of Jim Carrey, a simple facial expression will have you rolling about the floor with laughter. Particularly while he's shooting the commercials, the director is sooooo saying a lot more than just ""intensity"". Also the gym scene had me crying with laughter, and it got to the stage where it was painful. I loved how none of the Japanese is subtitled throughout the movie, leaving the audience just as lost as the characters. This was definitely a neat trick by Sophia, to really make you feel in touch with the lead characters.

The whole movie is about feeling lonely, not fitting in, stuck in a strange country, isolated in a crowd, and enjoying the attention of a stranger. Scarlett's portrayal of a young wife is spot on. She suspects her husband of cheating; she can't understand the language; can't find anything to fill her day; and then can't sleep at night. The strange thing about Scarlett is she looks positively dowdy and frumpy in this movie, totally different from her glam red carpet persona, but the look is so appropriate for the movie.

Regardless of what another reviewer said, this movie does not poke fun at the Japanese. Instead, the Japanese, although not highly featured, were hilarious, treating Bill Murray's character like some God. Plus, the language sounds really fun, although learning to speak or write it looks like trouble. Tokyo also looks like a really great place to visit, with all the bright lights, but I can imagine it would be also very difficult.

There was a great chemistry between Scarlett & Bill, that definitely came across in the movie, although their relationship was kind of like Thora Birch's & Steve Buscemi's relationship in Ghost World. Which Scarlett also starred in, and boy, she's come a long way! Their characters, Bob and Charlotte, never actually introduce themselves to each other.

Sofia Coppola wrote a lot of the film based on her life. The character of John (Giovanni Ribisi) was loosely based on her ex-husband Spike Jonze. Rumour has it that the Anna Faris' character, Kelly, was supposedly Cameron Diaz, with whom Spike Jonze worked on Being John Malkovich, though Coppola denied the connection in an Entertainment Weekly interview. (Friends fans: both Giovanni Ribisi & Anna Faris have starred in Friends!)

Some dialogue was improvised, including Bill's lines in the photo shoot and his conversation with Scarlett about his Shiatsu massage.

There are a couple of Sophia's trademarks in this including filming the sun coming through leaves of trees and filming from the outside of a car window looking in as the car moves. (Which in my personal opinion, is a really cool effect.)

The film's Spanish title in South America, ""Perdido en Tokio"", and its Hebrew title in Israel, ""Avudim be-Tokio"", both mean ""Lost in Tokyo"", meaning that the titles themselves were literally lost in translation. The reason being that there is no Hebrew phrase ""Lost in Translation"". An Israeli wouldn't understand the phrase.

In the hospital, the question that the elderly man with the cane tries to ask Bob (in Japanese) is: ""How many years have you been in Japan?"" Meanwhile, the diagnosis that Charlotte receives from the doctor (in Japanese) is that her toe is fractured, but taping is enough.

The ending of the movie had me in tears, as you knew perfectly well, that it was just a short friendship, that wasn't meant to continue outside of Japan. You can feel that they're both going to miss each other, and that visit will be something they'll always remember. The kiss between Bill and Scarlett at the end of the movie was not in the script, but was an ""in the moment"" ad-lib between the performers. The whispered bit was a truly emotional moment, and is open to interpretation about what he said to her, and what it meant. I'm not going to do what some reviewers have done & turn the volume up loud, to see if they can hear what was said, or make up rude/stupid things that Bill said. It was the best part of the movie, apart from the gym scene. It was the perfect ending to a terrific movie. I loved the fact it just ended like that between them. Sofia could have gone in a completely different direction, or she could have made Bill actually say something to Scarlett, instead of whispering it.

The extras include: a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola; deleted scenes; Kevin Shield's ""City Girl"" music video and Mattew's Best Hit TV-Extended scene.

This is a really brilliant movie, and I urge everyone who hasn't seen it, to watch it at least once. I want my own copy now. And it's not often I say that about a borrowed DVD. In a few years, this will be considered a classic. Right now, it's just excellent.

1.  the main characters are terrible people.  i think i should mention that i lived in japan for a year, studying abroad, yes i'm white, and i've been to almost all the places in the movie (that hotel aside).  speaking for myself and my foreign friends who were there, our first weeks there were awesome.  its completely different than america (or anywhere else i've been), theres so many places you want to go, you want to try new foods, go out, meet people, everything.  people ask me if i can relate to this movie, no i can't.  the main characters in the movie were filthy rich, staying at the nicest hotel in tokyo, and didn't enjoy themselves at all.  they were nothing but bitter to everyone.  the only characters in the movie who were at all inspired (maybe aside from the japanese party people) were the guy with the fishermans hat talking about making hip-hop beats (who they laughed at and left), and possibly the dumb blonde girl (she was dumb, but maybe she had potential?).  the two main characters just cried a lot.  if you think you can relate to them i'm sorry, get a hold of yourself.

2.  this movie is racist, in that all japanese people are portrayed as 1 dimensional, ignorant, and shallow.  examples i'm thinking of the surfer guys at the party (treated similar to the hip-hop guy mentioned above, i mena obviously what would the japanese know about surfing right?), the prostitute, film director, etc.  none of them are real developed characters.  perhaps its true that many travellers to japan don't really get to meet japanese people on a personal level, but if thats the case, well they've missed out and they should shut their mouths rather than perpetuate stereotypes.  jokes about L's and R's get old fast.  Scenes like the prostitute, and the guy with the bb gun, are, um, unrealistic at best.  but i'm not the only one who thinks its racist.  see [...] for more examples (no this isn't my site).

3.  the idea that japan has lost something of its beauty from ancient times.  the only example of this would be when the girl gets out of tokyo to the snow covered temple in Nara.  Well this is a nice image, and its ""the japan which once was"", something lost in the modern maze of consumer culture, etc.  people who feel this way may or may not believe that all japanese pre WWII were zen monks, or samurai, or artisans.  no.  while things are different about japanese culture now no doubt, there is a different kind of beauty outside of quiet temples.  perhaps one might prefer the quiet temple historical kind, but in that case, stay home, read a history book, and don't be another brainwashed japan-o-phile touring the country complaining whenever they aren't at a tourist trap ::cough cough kyoto and nara cough cough::

4.  this movie is boring, and pretentious.  if you think the photography is beautiful, well perhaps it is, but thats how japan actually looks, so be impressed with the locations, not the film..  also if you think silence is meaningful try meditation.  bah, this movie is just boring.

bottom line, if you saw this film and you liked it, don't talk to me about about it and don't ever go to japan",1108252800,18,3735,4.611532625189682

Just what the heck was the point, or dare I ever venture to say PLOT of this film? I've watched this film thrice and I haven't deciphered the plot.......ok ok fine..it goes something like this: disillusioned middle-aged married celebrity meets disillusioned newly-wed in totally alien country and culture and adventures are had therein.....but so? So what? The characters just sort of flounder in a wierd sort of ambiguity for nearly the entire film. The only hint of a REAL character development is towards the end when Murray's character says something along the lines of ""hang in there"" and ""you still have time"" referring to Johanssen's character's life and marriage. Well, gee.....that's a real no-brainer, and it took the entire length of the film to get to it.

Another fine example of a film in which flash (the imagery, soundtrack, what-have you) is placed ahead of substance and the ""flash"" elements are made to appear substantial.",1107907200,8,1049,4.9602272727272725
1499666,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is the type of story that you have to sit back and appreciate for the work or art it is.  This movie is so masterful in all of its respects, it almost defies explanation. Sofia Coppola is able to tell this story with an adept and skillful manner, so much so that you almost miss how wonderful it is from the get-go.  Sometimes it takes two viewings, to catch all of the nuances, the subtleties, the little pieces that make this movie great.

It is the story of Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson)and their finding one another in the midst of the largest city in the world, Tokyo.  I won't go into plot details, as that is what the movie is about.  Instead, some thematics.

The story revolves around lonliness.  The fact that this is the most populous city in the world, and these two Americans are without spouses, without friends goes to show that the lonliness is not mere physical distance, but emotional, cultural, almost spiritual.  And in the midst of their crises, these two find each other and bond together to help one another through their lonely times.  It is a tale also of finding yourself, getting yourself out of a rut, with their careers and marriages and life in general.  But, it is never too late, you can never be too alone, for breaking the cycle and trying something new.  Together they break-out, investigating Tokyo together and finding renewed viggor for their own lives.

They are also together in a way that two people do not usually share.  Bob is old enough to be Charlotte's father, yet there is a bond there that is almost like love, but never really defined.  Something beyond friendship (as is evident when Bob sleeps with the lounge singer), but they never consumate their marriage physically, which is a relief.  Yet you can feel the connection between them, even when they are standing outside of a hotel at 3am during a fire alarm.  There is a bond there, something unique, wonderful as it is indescribable.  This relationship propels both of them forward into their lives, leaves them both smiling at the end of the movie.

This is what has to be Bill Murray's best performance ever, Oscar-worthy if there ever was an acting role that deserved a golden statue.  What makes his role so beautifully poignant is that it is very subtle.  He doesn't cry a lot, he doesn't yell or scream, a lot of the time he doesn't even say much at all.  Yet it is in the way his body, his smile, his eyes, it is how these facets of his personality manifest the inner emotions that make the role great.  When he is shaving, and he holds up the tiny, plastic razor looking in the mirror, his face sums up his entire situation, without the need for words.

Similarly, Scarlett Johansson is remarkable, also for her subtle way of portraying the quarter-life crisis Charlotte.  From her body language, the way she moves, or even just sits and looks out over Tokyo, evokes her mood and gives us a glimpse of her inner emotions, more-so than her husband can appreciate.

This movie is very understated, and I feel underrated.  It gives just dazzling performances from two very talented actors, and it tells a tale that is wonderful as it is instructive and uplifting all the same time.  I whole-heartedly recommend this film to everyone, especailly if you are feeling a bit lonely.",1107820800,5,3338,4.63265306122449
1499667,5,B00005JMJ4,"When I first saw this movie, honestly, I wasn't impressed. My friends drug me out to see it, so I just ""went along for the ride"". Not only did my mind wander, but I only got a cursory view of what the movie is about. I decided to give it another chance, and it was indeed a film that pulls you in. Having been to Tokyo myself, it was  a small dose of familiarity. This is a film that must be viewed a few times to really be appreciated.

Bill Murray plays the role of Bob Harris, an actor who seems to be going through a mid-life crisis in both his career and marriage. Harris flies to Tokyo to film a commercial for Suntory Whisky, and seems not to enjoy the job too much, despite the healthy financial compensation. Scarlett Johhannsen plays the role of Charlotte, a young wife who tags along with her workaholic photographer husband. She appears to be neglected as a wife, and yearns for her husband's attention, and eventually, anyone's attention. Bored and feeling neglected, she ventures out of the confines of her hotel room, and into the pulsating, neon lit and mysterious atmosphere of Tokyo, a world unto itself. She not only enjoys the modern, contemporary side, but respects and appreciates the ancient and traditonal customs as well.
A few nights later, unable to sleep, Charlotte heads down to the bar where Harris is having a nightcap, and the two instantly connect. I  think the reason for the connection was the fact that they sensed each other were lost, and at different crossroads in their own lives, and not so much the fact that they were both many miles from home. I believe the fact that the bar was filled with other Americans confirms this, at least from my own perspective. This movie should speak volumes to everyone, because we have, or will experience being ""Lost in Translation"" at some point in our lives. We will be Bob Harris or Charlotte, and will deal with our journeys in our own unique ways. Sometime, I feel like Bob Harris, and can definitely identify with him, but in my own way. It also demonstrates that even though many of our friendships may last for just a ""season"", they will be un forgettable.
The two begin to explore the city's karaoke bars, districts and parties. One would probably interpret that there is something sexual about to occur here due to the chemistry between Bill and Charlotte, but that doesn't happen. However, when Charlotte knocks on Bob's door one morning and finds he is in the company of another woman, she is indeed offended, as if it were her own lover or husband. The ending is very special, as Bob, who could not wait to leave Japan at the beginning of the movie, suddenly finds himself dreading the trip back to the states and leaving Charlotte behind. I also think the location adds to the mystique of this great film. This will stay in my collection forever! All I can say now is ""WoW""!",1107734400,,2865,4.559223300970873
1499668,4,B00005JMJ4,"This film could just as easily be called: Lost in transition. It is a film about transitions and people trying to find their way in this world. You have young people making the transition to being an adult. You have middle aged people going though their mid life transition. All of this set in Japan, a country making a transition into the modern world, yet holding on to some of their traditions. Even a clip about an older man making a transiton to being old.

Scarlett Johansson continues to do outstanding work, and like Bill, you connect with them as someone you like.

This movie is an attempt to establish communication between rich and poor, privileged and common, young and old, east and west. It deals with how much gets lost in the translation. I found the bonus material on thie DVD to be better than the film itself. The bonus clips give you more of a feel for the city of Tokyo and the people of Japan.

Bill Murrray does comedy and this film is an attempt for him to do a bit of drama and a bit of romance. The question was: How much to hold him back from being funny. I think they held him back to much and tried to make the movie a bit to serious and thus they ended up with a three instead of a four star rating. But they were right I believe to maintain some artistic integerty and not try to go for all out comedy so as to over due it.

Everyone did a really good job, but as the title suggests somethings get lost in translation and that is what this movie is all about. Dealing with what gets lost in translations, along with a secondary theme of dealing with lifes transitions.

Another problem is they ignore Lazarus, you never see the homeless person, and your not introduced to his perspective. To much gets lots in translation, so that you never really get to know the people of Tokyo. But you get a lot more of a introduction in the Bonus material than you do the movie itself.

Otherwise they get the job done and deliver on what they say they were going to deliver on. Of course these are all top rated professionals, so you would expect that they are going to persevere and accomplish what they set out to do. Even as they all deal with lifes transitions and struggle with what gets lost in translation along the way.

This is a film that can be studied as a work that shows what can be done with a small budget and a small crew. They could have worked a bit more on the script, but they depended on Bill to improvise, which seemed to be fine with him.",1107475200,,2483,4.259023354564756
1499669,2,B00005JMJ4,"This looks like something a bunch of uni students put together. Except these guys had enough money to rope in someone like Bill Murray. I usually love 'arty' films, but to me this just lacked depth. This is about two people who find some comfort in each other while feeling somewhat lost in their own lives. There is a little flirting, an occasional and sometimes awkward kiss on the cheek, a couple of kareoke parties where not much happens, dialog between the main characters is kept to a minimum and often the characters simply blend into the background, which sometimes I think is more interesting than their own story. I think this is the kind of movie, where the characters should have been explored a lot more, so that the audience can really connect with them. There's a scene in this film where Bill is appearing in a Whiskey advertisement and you can see that he just wants to get the heck out of there, probably thinking: is this what my life has come to? Half way through this film, I started to wander if that's how he felt about this film. I realise some people loved this, but it didn't do it for me. There was not enough depth for me to be emotionally drawn to this story and I think the potential was there.",1107302400,10,1224,4.420353982300885
1499670,5,B00005JMJ4,"I absolutely loved this film. It's so raw, yet it feels like a velvet dream.

I guess some people just want that prepackaged, high-strung drama, or the gut-busting comedy. ""Bill Murray is in it? Cool!"" Ten minutes later... ""What the hell is this?""

On that note, Bill Murray's deadpan portrayal of a burned-out actor looking for a few quick bucks is dead on. The commercial and photo shoot scenes are hilarious, and it's very entertaining to watch ""Bob Harris"" cope with jet lag.

This is a bedtime/relaxation movie, no doubt. It's so soft and surreal that it fades from your memory, no matter how hard you try to hang on to it, like some wonderful dream...",1107129600,4,844,4.695945945945946

The idea of simply taking a moment in two peoples lives and exploring it is more than many people can apparently comprehend. To all of you, I say, enjoy the next Vin Deisel flick, or if you hurry, the Blade film may still be running, somewhere...

Bill Murray portrays an aging actor who, needing the easy money, goes to Japan for a week to endorse a brand of whiskey. Johanson is the nearly forgotten young wife of a pasty-faced, stuttering celeb photographer who is left constantly alone while he works.

The two lonely's, are each at different points in life, he just going over the hill, her still down in the valley taking her first steps. He lives through her youth and optomism, she through his age and experience. Together they teeter on the edge of sexual tension as well as burgeoning friendship.

The movie has no big pay off. Many feel both are unhappy in there lives and maybe should leave them for each other, others feel that the age thing is just creepy, and yet others just don't get it.

This is a study in basic human emotion and reaction to situation. It's a film about the short time two people knew each other.",1107129600,5,1243,4.511111111111111
1499672,1,B00005JMJ4,"""In America"" should have won. That movie is far superior than this one. But enough about that. This is how ""Lost in Translation"" goes. Two Americans saw each other in an elevator and smiled at each other. Then they met again,this time they talked. Then they decided to meet each other again. During those meetings,Scarlett's character seem to always flirt with Bill's character (maybe if he's not a ""celebrity"" she wouldn't even do that).Until one day,its time for Bill to go,Scarlett is sad,before separating he whispered to her,the end. That's it! You think this movie is smart?That's funny,I didn't know a lot of you have the intelligence of a 13 year old. I'm a fan of ""lost souls looking for purpose"" movies since im going through that and I was expecting to get and learn something from it and I didn't. I thought the highlight of the film is when they're lying on the bed and finally they get to tell each other their issues but of course they didn't really do that (I guess they just quit since they can't really tell each other what's bugging them anyway) and its quite unsatisfying. Yeah there are some happenings in the movie but they don't really help. No character development,it just goes on and on. This is a real dissapointment. I expected a lot from this because im a Bill Murray fan (and im aware that this is not your typical Bill Murray flick) and I wished that he won the Oscar because he may never be nominated again,but that was before watching this movie,now,Im glad Sean Penn won. This movie is not ""deep"",smart nor very artistic and those people who thinks that, probably didn't see a lot of really good,deep,intelligent and artsy films. This movie isn't one of the worst films ever though it didn't live up to its promise.
  I don't think its a matter of getting the movie,sure I got it. But as I said,this movie is not deep or smart or incomprehensible,its just that,I never felt anything for these characters nor the movie itself. I really couldn't care less about these people.

1499673,1,B00005JMJ4,"From all the film reviews I'd expected something more intelligent than the retreaded humor about how Japanese roll their r's, their short stature (actually they're getting quite tall these days, must be eating more McBurgers), and cultural differences played for laughs. Murray's character is a snotty bore, angry and frustrated for being there, and dimissive of a culture that he never really tries to understand. The ugly American in a foreign land who is angry because the natives don't speak English correctly; the nerve!

I'd have more sympathy for Murray's character if he'd actually tried to reach out to anyone, got off his sorry duff and tried to reach out the Japanese for a change, use a few lines of broken Japanese perhaps, but he never does and that's the shame of this film. Coppola seems talented and the cinematography was beautiful, but this film still read like a spoiled, jaded rich girl's vision of Japan. It was all about the beautiful surface.",1107043200,18,966,4.92638036809816
1499674,4,B00005JMJ4,"I know. You're resistant to the trendy film by the Marc Jacobs wearing daughter of a legend. Everybody probably just says they love it because everybody else says they should. I know. I have my suspicions about movies like that. I've watched people tremble and say, ""LIT changed my life it is soooooo goood.""

Here is a level-headed opinion on why this is a good movie: This movie is about loneliness and isolation in a close-packed city of millions. You feel the character's loneliness. You feel their brief sparks of connection. You feel them clutch at opportunities for connection.

And it takes skill to pull this off - this movie could have quickly gone into non-narrative snoozeville. But although she follows the climax resolution format, the framework doesn't come poking through the story like it does in so many Hollywood films. It flows like a well documented life and that's high praise.

Also, to see Bill Murray be such a great, mature character is a thing of beauty. Like when John Travolta came back courtesy of Pulp Fiction.

Movies today aren't so good. So many are made to show off a special effects technique or to make a big car chase or be a vehicle for a star. This movie has a story and everything is there to bring that story to life. To bring you to the point. And that's how it should be.",1106265600,8,1315,4.582978723404255
1499675,5,B00005JMJ4,"What a beautiful, thoughtful and sweet movie this is.  Sofia Coppola is a brilliant storyteller and has crafted a film with more warmth, heart and intelligence than most films out today.

Casting Bill Murray in this role might be the best casting choice of 2003.  He is so wonderful as this character because, honestly, in many ways he is this character.  As Murray has aged we have seen less and less of him, and there was a point where it would have been very easy for him to cross the threshold into has-been or, worse, self-parody.  He did hold on, albeit not with the same superstar power he once held, and has managed to grow and mature into one of the best, most underrated actors of our day.  Who would have thought that would be possible? As for Scarlett Johansson, again with the great casting choice.  She has the freshness, vulnerability and energy to carry this off, yet such depth and maturity as well.  She is wise beyond her years and yet still so young, and a gifted actress.  There is chemistry beyond chemistry between these two and that's a big reason the film works, because with less talented or poorly matched actors we might be a bit turned-off by the age difference between them, yet I found myself wanting things to work out for them even when I knew it couldn't be.  And the fact that Coppola was honest and true to the characters she created instead of taking the easy way out speaks volumes of her integrity as an artist.  We have been conditioned to look for the happy ending, and our version of ""happy ending"" is ""happy ending in bed"".  But these are real people on the screen, with real lives and real consequences which they cannot forget about.  And their decision to remain true to the others in their lives, their understanding of the imposibility of their being together, is much more moving than any climactic (no pun intended) romp in bed could ever be.  The final scene alone speaks volumes, though nothing is really said between them.  But we know they understand each other, and we can see that it's enough for them.  So it becomes enough for us, if we're willing to cast aside our pre-conditioned notions of ""romance"" and remember that not everything we want is truly meant to be.

Everything about this film is just so perfect.  Tokyo is bright, beautiful and exciting.  The dialogue is tremendous, most especially in the quiet, intimate conversations which are seemingly meaningless but are actually the meat of what makes the characters.  It takes greater talent to pull off a scene like that than a highly-charged emotional one.  And the message is so heartbreaking and beautiful....like Don Quixote said, ""to love pure and chaste from afar""....In this case, it's much more affective.",1106092800,12,2731,4.695378151260504

I imagine that the movie company deserves some blame as they did sell this movie as a comedy.  I think it is an absolutely brilliant movie.  I have found that my friends who have travelled to the Far East and have encountered the culture shock displayed in the movie all like this movie.  I think it's easier to relate to the jetlag, culture shocked world in which the characters find themselves.  I certainly can understand how being dropped into an alien world would cause one to assess all their assumptions and find themselves lost as the characters do.

I think the ennui and the unresolved nature of the movie disturbs a lot of people.  Most movie goers seem to like a neat little story in which the protagonist changes and becomes a better person or the bad guy gets what's coming to them.  This movie is realistic to me because a) the old man DOESN'T sleep with the young girl. b) there is no SOLUTION for their problems (they are just able to console each other) c) their relationship is realistic because in their own society they would have nothing in common but here in Japan they are kindred souls.

We can enjoy movies in many different ways and watch movies and apreciate them from many different angles. I really cannot find anything in Lost In Translation that is worth shouting about. The story does not move me in anyway, just two lone people hanging out in Tokyo; they don't inspire each other after the meeting; their life is not changed in any way, for better or worse; there is no beautiful cinematography or any interesting camera works, the list goes on, the charactors just met, hang out and say goodbye when the 2-hours is up.

This movie about a beyond-his-prime American Movie Star visiting Tokyo because he got a hefty paycheck to promote Japanese Scotch...... could be seen as depressing.  It could be seen as having ""no story""... it could be seen as boring.

It is none of those.

The pace of the movie allows you to find your own tempo alongside the movie's tempo.

The humor is wry and understated.

The relationships are real and the ending is another ""non-Hollywood"" ending.

The acting tends towards subtle, nuanced and intelligent.  (I also found myself wondering what it would have been like if Scarlett Johansson had received the role in ""Parent Trap"" that went to Lindsey Lohan. Would she be a Disney Diva now? Shudder to think....)

I loved the scenes of Bill Murray dealing with the Directors of the Scotch commercials. Very funny.

There were also great ""I don't fit here"" sequences, wordless yet among the most strongly stated of the movie.

The contrast between old-world Rome and neon flavored Tokyo was astonishing - and since I watched this bonus AFTER the movie, I was also reminded of how much Scarlett Johansson's performance seemed to echo Sofia Coppola, the writer-director herself.

Both have soft voices, appear very present yet just a wee bit unattached... spend a lot of time just thinking (from all appearances) and doesn't show much emotion yet we somehow sense there is a lot of feeling going on in there... somewhere.

In fact - that last paragraph is a passable description of the movie itself.",1105228800,8,1939,4.818731117824774
1499791,5,B00005JMJ4,"....I have.  We lived there from 2000-2003, and the first few months were very lonely for me due to the extreme differences in the culture.  To make a very long story short, our time near Tokyo has changed us forever, and we love Japan as a second home.  The friends we have there are very dear to us.  There is a brilliance in this movie that we don't see very often.  The scene where the whiskey commercial is filmed made us laugh.  The Japanese man talks for several minutes, and the translator comes back with just a few words; it's like that!  The English translation is usually shorter.  We saw things in that movie that made us miss Japan every time we see the movie.  For those who watch the movie and have any sense of cultural appreciation and sentimentality, pay attention to the scences when ""Charlotte"" talks to her friend stateside (who sounds shallow) about her first trip to the shrine, or how she willingly accepts her first ikebana lesson.  To see the Americans slow down and consider another country's traditions and cultural expressions as options to their own is a mature attitude, and I guess it takes a mature attitude to watch this movie and ""get it"".  See it for yourselves, and I hope you get to experience Japan some day....

p.s.  My ONLY negative comment is about a club scene that made the movie have an R rating.  Other than that almost-nude scene that was out of place in this movie, it could've been a PG-13.  It's probably pretty realistic about some of the clubs in Tokyo, but it could've been left out of a movie.  My 2 cents.",1105228800,20,1562,4.48581560283688

Lost in Translation was not made to be a box office smash.  It is a truly sensitive look at relationships, lonliness and culture.  The cinematography is beautiful, the acting superb, and its themes are timeless without being trite.  It also has some of the funniest moments that I've seen in a film in a long while.  Unfortunately, some people missed all of this, and these people may describe the film as any of the following: boring, weird, stupid, immoral, pointless.

1499912,4,B00005JMJ4,"The reason why many people panned this movie in their Amazon review is the same reason why a movie like ""National Treasure"" does so well at the box office: namely that most people are pretty dumb, and unless a movie has explosions, car chases and naked chicks writhing around to bad rap music, they just can't understand or get into it. Or if they're female they don't get the movie unless it has a bunch of overblown, hard-to-believe sappy romance. Don't get me wrong, every once in awhile I like to watch a brainless action movie too, or (even more seldom) a sappy romance, but most of the time I like my movies smart, and Lost in Translation is a smart movie. So it's really not surprising many people didn't like it.

Most of the people who wrote positive reviews did get it: this movie isn't about people going somewhere, or accomplishing something. It's a snapshot of a few days in the lives of two very different people who are lonely, not only because they are in a very alien culture but because they are at crisis points in their lives, and they searching for human connection. I won't waste my time talking about people's allegations that the younger girl-older man thing was ""creepy"" or that it was immoral for Bill Murray's character and Scarlett Johannsen's character to spend time together because both characters are married. All I have to say about that is: it's the 21st century, y'all, and it's time to grow up. I thought this was a very intelligent, sensitive portrait of two people who the outside world would view as successful but who feel very lost and alone. Their relationship wasn't about sex or unrealistic sappy romance (the two things most movie romances are based on), but about two minds meeting and two people finding out they aren't as different from other people as they had thought. I don't know, maybe the movie is hard to understand if you've lived a completely straight-line, unexamined, unadventurous life. But I went through a crisis similar to the one experienced by Scarlett Johannsen's character when I was about her age, so I could totally understand where her character was coming from. I have also traveled overseas (including to Japan) so I understand what it's like to feel ""lost"" in a foreign culture, so far from your home. Since most Americans, especially those in the Midwest, have never been farther than 300 miles from Columbus or Grand Rapids or Milwaukee or wherever, I imagine the whole idea of foreign travel is a mystery to them. But anyway. This is a great movie, it makes you think and it stays with you long after you've seen it.

For her first movie, Sofia Coppola did an outstanding job, but she is nowhere near the director her father is... yet. The story itself is nice, but it falls a little short for me personally. I saw much of the depiction of Japan as right no, but I also felt the isolation the two are suppose to feel is totally overblown. I see it as a very American view of the world, if it is different why should I try to understand it. This might not have been the director's intention, but that is what I got out of the movie.

1499916,1,B00005JMJ4,"This film is about two people and how they meet up and develop a temporary relationship in Japan.  Both are at troubled spots in their lives.  Bill Murray plays Harris, a man who is currently in a mid-life crisis.  Johansson plays Charlotte, a twenty-five year old woman who has been left alone by her husband, for some time.  Both Harris and Charlotte find temporary solace in each other.

While this film attempts to be creative, it is just like an American Beauty rip-off, and I could not stand American Beauty.  The only reasons these characters came together was because they were the only ones there who were American.  I'm not trying to be ethnocentric; this is how both Murray's and Johansson's characters act.

Probably the worst aspect of this film, other than the fact that it was lauded over for nothing, is that there is no real conclusion (and that's not a spoiler).  Nothing gets achieved, no one learns anything, and nothing is better off for the two of them having met.

The closes thing to this film is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which is incredibly better.  I would just stay away from Lost in Translation, unless you want to hear what all the gawk is about, because you are better off not seeing it.",1105056000,8,1231,4.626728110599078

After around 45 mins into the film and trying my best to find the dull humor funny I still waited for the movie to start. It never does. Now, I don't think I'm closed to experimental cinema but this was just one of the most frustration inducing films ever. Its not torturous but just in plain simple words A waste of our valuable time. I love movies and Im not really picky. I didn't find one scene in the film that made me sit up and take notice. Now , I simply try to figure out what it was that made people like this film. Maybe the actor's really famous but I must say there's absolutely no chemistry in this film.

Anyway, this film manages to say so very much by doing so very little, which is a very difficult thing to do and is only to be found with the most talented artists. As impressive as The Virgin Suicides was, this is better by a very great margin. To answer one of the punctuation-free commentators who has already dismissed this film, the reason that many people are not able to precisely articulate their feelings about this film is because it gets to a very deep level of human feeling, which is hard to express for even the most literate of people.

The greatness of the film is boosted by the fact that it shows how great American cinema can be when it is not pandering to the mass market, the lowest common denominator or whatever else holds all the dollars. One single overture to the Big Dumb American Film and Lost in Translation would have been sunk. However, Coppola brilliantly steers it away from the stupid, obvious, spell-it-all-out-for-you syndrome and leaves us to use our imaginations. Lost in Translation is simply one of the finest films ever made, and the critical mauling it gets here from certain people tells me how far ahead it is of mainstream comprehension.

The most incredible thing about this movie is that I actually watched the whole thing.

They meet in the hotel bar and soon develop a surprising friendship. I must admit that the scenery in this movie is breathtaking. I waited and waited for this movie to pick up the pace and it never did. The soundtrack is so depressing. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson seem like they've both been drugged and forced to do this movie. The only time they come to life is when Bill Murray cheats on his wife and Scarlett comes to his room to ask him out to lunch while the other woman is still there. The following lunch is full of tension and quiet anger. The scenes where Murray is filming the whiskey commercials are also amusing. Overall this movie is just not that entertaining.

1500040,1,B00005JMJ4,"This is definitely a film for soap opera queens, not serious film lovers.  It lacks the filmic depth and intrigue of great romance films and is ultimately forgetful.

This movie is about the mundane adventures of two rich white people in Japan.  Bill Murray doesn't really show the classic characteristics of male romance protagonists, which would have the auspices of making him appealing, but the fact is he is not that interesting as a character at all.  His two main characteristics seem to be that he is rich and he is bored.  This begins to wear on the viewer until they realize who had exactly made the film, another person who was also rich and bored.

Murray has appeared in other dramas that have tried to test his dramatic ability, anybody remember Razor's Edge?... didn't think so, which have landed mediocre reception.  Murray is best when he is cut loose and zany.  In this movie he just kinda bloats around, looking out of place, restrained, until he meets another person from his home country, and they parade around town poking fun at the natives.  Murray, being a comedic genius, could have used these scenes as very funny moments, riffing as he usually does with pomposity, but instead the scenes drivel out, as does most of the film.  The ending offers no real meaning or fulfillment and I found myself trying to keep my eyelids open.  The emotional space explored in the film is mostly confusion and sulking, which I guess make it a perfect woman's film.

If you thought this movie lacked substance, a good substitute might be Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises,"" another story about confused white people in a foreign country, but this one is a classic and a great read.",1104796800,10,1689,4.726962457337884

I felt like I was trapped in this enormously beautiful hotel in the middle of nowhere, far away from home.  Having been left in many a hotel across the country by my father on business trips, I identified with Scarlett Johanssen's character.  ""Lost in Translation"" translates to ""Lost Souls"", in my analogy of the film.  Both of the characters seemed to be jaded to some degree and both suffered from manic depression that seemed to be untreated. ""Lost in Translation"" has the charm and mysterious intrigue of the Japanese culture (which I happen to be fascinated by), and has a soothing pace and temperment that subtlely mesmorizes.

1500045,4,B00005JMJ4,"When reading the negative reviews of Lost in Translation one usually sees ""no plot"" cited as the main weapon of choice. But when one thinks about it you realize the critic really can't come up with the proper words to describe why they don't like the film. Usually the real reason is just boredom. To cite ""having no plot"" as a reason for a film to be bad, such as Lost in Translation, is a statement by one who does not understand that all films are not about plot or have to be plot-driven. Martin Scorcese once remarked: ""If I watch a movie and all I remember is the plot, then the movie failed. If I come out remembering moments, then its a success.""

It's all about ""moments"" and that's the core of Lost in Translation.

Someone once said that a bad storyteller ends their story with ""You had to be there."" Where as a great storyteller makes you feel like you were. That is Sophia Coppola's, aptly rewarded, success in her original screenplay and film. She takes a subject so insanely difficult to capture and nails it without ever having to succumb to Hollywood cliches and its still memorable and translates to the audience. If you've ever tried to put down into writing a moment in your life that was so deeply, emotionally profound you'll understand why this film is a success. While everything seems so light and trvial on the surface, you know there is so much more brimming underneath. Its normal for some to not get this after just watching the movie once (I too felt a bit underwhelmed), but afterwards one might come off with a feeling of bliss, and then maybe after a second or third viewing one might actually find themselves finally understanding the spell of Lost in Translation.",1104451200,10,1698,4.563934426229508

Perhaps there is such as thing as ""too intelligent"" then...

It's fascinating because this movie is so bad, so boring, so hopelessly bereft of plot, character, or any kind of story, that those watching are duped.  It's the banal effect, where something is so mind-numbing it reminds them of having to read Shakespeare in high school, or being forced to go to the symphony by a date or spouse.  If it's banal, it must be high-minded and sophisticated.  Nothing can be further from the truth; and this film couldn't be further from greatness.",1104364800,13,1123,4.782383419689119
1500047,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" is, for lack of a better word, a masterpiece.  Grounded by two wonderfully restrained performances by two talented actors as well as a pitch-perfect supporting cast, this movie tells a melancholy, intelligent romantic tale of two lost Americans who find redemption in each other.

There may not be a better city in which to cast Americans adrift than Tokyo.  Ms. Coppola's personal experiences in this neon-lit metropolis reportedly provided some of the inspiration for this movie, and the movie definitely satisfies that backstory.  A very quiet film, many of its most important moments transpire when a single character silently tries to absorb this fantastic place, and simply comes up short.  Whether its a shot out over the city from a high motel window, or up from the streets to the gigantic neon advertisements, the viewer perpetually shrinks to insignificance in the face of Tokyo's sheer mass.

Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an actor's whose cinematic successes and his ambition are behind him, in town to shoot a booze commercial for $2 million.  He is saddled with a bevy of Japanese ""handlers"" at his hotel who are over-eager to assist him, and his attempts to work with his Japanese-speaking director are priceless (needless to say, Harris speaks no Japanese and doesn't want to make the effort to learn). Murray may have been cast perfectly in his world-famous comedies like ""Caddyshack"" and ""Stripes,"" but he was born to play Bob.  Murray radiates fatigue, and his tired eyes reveal a soul that could find the humor in his ridiculous situation but is just too drained to make the effort.  His repeated phone calls home to his distant wife fail to recharge his soul, and if anything, create a bigger burden to bear.  Bob is truly a man too weighted down by his choices to pursue his dreams any longer.

Charlotte (Scarlett Johannson, in another shockingly good performance) is in many respects Bob's alter ego.  Charlotte's obtuse, insensitive husband John (a great supporting performance by Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer in Tokyo for a shoot, and Charlotte has tagged along.  John, eager to make it in the entertainment biz, quickly abandons Charlotte, and she is cast adrift in the enormity of Tokyo.  But as a 25-year old Yale graduate, she is intelligent enough to know that she should be doing more but is perhaps too young to know what her life's ambition should be.  In her own way, Charlotte is as adrift as Bob, but she bears the burden of cautious inexperience.

These two lost souls meet in the chic hotel bar.  Bob is attracted to Charlotte's beauty and innocent wit, while Charlotte is drawn to this man of charm and obvious experience.  Soon they are exploring both Tokyo and each other, both through their conversations and their mutual ability to inspire the good things in each other.  Romance is obviously kindling between them, but both also put on the brakes . . . out of a combined sense of propriety -- both are married after all -- and also a sense that this relationship is too important for a tumble in the sack.

Eventually, the movie builds to its much-discussed climax, a whispered assertion that will have you leaning forward in your seat as you strain to hear what is actually said.  This entirely unexpected ending is one of the most romantic and hopeful moments you will ever see on screen.

If you have ever complained that all Hollywood is interested in is big-budget star-driven shoot-em-ups that spend more effort on their stunts than their dialogue, this movie is a perfect antidote.  While it's doubtful that ""Lost in Translation"" will create a tourist boom for Tokyo, the movie is also made with an obvious affection for the big Japanese city, and that in its own way is touching as well.

A must for the film library!",1104364800,8,3815,4.851851851851852
1500048,4,B00005JMJ4,"It is a bit of a surprise to see people so polarized by the this movie.  It seems that it's an 'all or nothing' proposition.  For my part, I found that it was tasteful and restrained, but would have been much better had it not been cheapened by a few stereotypes and loose moments.  For example, it is ludicrous to think that a super-high end Tokyo hotel wouldn't have shower heads tall enough to suit Bob Harris.  And if someone wanted to really provide a call girl to someone in Tokyo on a $2 million dollar job, it would be at a much higher level than the unfortunate 'lip my stockings' lady.  You can get the best of everything in Tokyo.  As well, Charlotte's trip to Kyoto seems to be in the film for no other reason than to get Air's 'Alone in Kyoto' on the soundtrack.

Making the connection between Tokyo and My Bloody Valentine is a brilliant stroke, though one might quibble with the song choices.  There is a scene with beautiful photography of Tokyo's lights from above, for which the soundtrack uses MBV's 'Sometimes'.  Maybe Kevin Shields wanted the vain pleasure of hearing his own voice, but 'Blown a Wish', 'To Here Knows When', or 'Loomer' (in that order) would be better choices.  The juxtaposition of Bilinda Butcher's dreamy voice layered over queasy arrangements of those songs are much more in line with the spirit of the movie than the gorgeous, leaden, dirge of 'Sometimes'.  Beautiful things layered on shaky foundations describe Bob and Charlotte's 'romance', and suit Tokyo, too.

The music choices are less serious when compared to the stereotype problems that mar the film.  Much like having found a hair in you food at a superior restaurant, one tends to remember the flaws more than the other lovely things that should be remembered.  This is a worthwhile movie, with certain cheap errors that leave you wondering how they could happen in something otherwise excellent.

it is not a humorous film. it is not even nearly funny, and especially not so on the rare occasions when it tries to be.

the devil of this film is all in the details. the cinematography is beautiful, and sophia coppolla conveys the minutiae of the film's core emotional content wonderfully. a special mention is also deserved for the fantastic 'soundtrack' provided by 'that guy from My Bloody Valentine'', which accentuates the ethereal and dreamlike states of Bill and Scarlett's characters.

what i found to be particularly intriguing was the concept of a 'small romance' that this film centres around. the two main characters both know on some level that nothing can really become of their relationship and that, were it not for the necessity imparted by their situation in tokyo, they almost certainly would never have occasion to explore one-another so profoundly as they do during their stay: lethargy has gripped the pair far too much for them to find anything but a temporary, though incredibly meaningful, meeting of souls. the film conveys an unconventional - yet very real, very heartfelt and thought-provoking modern romance.",1104192000,3,1361,5.121621621621622

after all the hype of this movie...i was not impressed.
i was bored and knew exactly where the story was going all the way through...
although i liked the fact that there was no need for sexual display and they had their own chemistry blend going, nonetheless, it was all in all quite ridiculous.(we all have that in people we come across though -whether it being strangers or not and this was not an extraordinary event of happenings.
ohhhhh, but since coppola wrote it and produced it...but of course it MUST be original (???)--miss coppola, even the 'little people' make these moments happen in a much more exciting and fun way than your little 'lost' movie did. (without sex too).
yawwwwwn.  miss coppola's love letter to japan?  how demeaning for the japanese!

want to rent something grand?  go for 'son of the bride' (in spanish with english subtitles)...now that's a moving story worth tuning into.  you'll feel each character.",1104105600,5,1010,4.781609195402299
1500169,2,B00005JMJ4,"I get the feeling the reason many people like this film is for the cinematography, which is admittedly artfully done, because they are Johansson and/or Murray fans, or because they have the same condescending, dry, humor this movie has.

I saw the two main characters as snobs, who couldn't be bothered to respectfully engage with Japanese people, because they have ""funny accents"". And besides their own problems were just so huge. Please...Spare me, the insignificant depressions of the characters in this film.

Married to the wrong man?

GET A DIVORCE.

Don't like your TEMPORARY job, but getting paid lots of money for it?

SUCK IT UP AND WORK LIKE A PROFFESSIONAL UNTIL YOU'RE DONE.

Lonely?

STOP ACTING LIKE A SNOB and maybe people will like you. OR maybe you'll meet another snob, like Johansson's character did. :-)

For those who sit back and laugh sarcasticly, rather than engage on any real level, I think any alienation they feel is their own fault. Therefore, I couldn't relate to the main characters' ""dilemma"" in this film.

This film is supposedly Coppola's ""love-letter"" to Japan. I guess to some, expressing love means treating the people and aspects of their culture as funny props rather than fully, realized, human beings.

I found this film dull and offensive. I think this film is for those who are amused by the same things the main characters in this film are: Laughing derisively at ""funny accents"" and the ""funny people"" they never bother to get to know.",1104105600,14,1483,4.896

1500171,5,B00005JMJ4,"I had heard a lot about this movie (mainly that it was amazing, brilliant, and the bestest best film ever in the whole world... ever), so when I finally got a chance to see it at the cinema I spent the entire time thinking ""OK, when do we get to the exciting bit?"". The thing about 'Lost In Translation' is that it's not gripping or an adrenaline rush. In fact, it's quite the opposite. It sets the mood of temporary, somewhat self-inflicted, isolation through relatable, realistic characters. It seems more like a documentary than a movie. I found it more enjoyable on my second viewing on DVD (perhaps because I was prepared in advance for what sort of movie it is), and I suggest viewing it with an alcoholic drink and nuts rather than popcorn and a coke (you feel like you're sitting in that hotel bar with them). DVD is also a much more personal medium than cinema, and this is a very personal movie. It's amazing how the sprawling city of Tokyo is quite literally just a backdrop; this could be taking place anywhere at all.

I must admit I thought a few of the Japanese caricature characters were a bit annoying (though funny, all the same - just look at Bill's face when his translator is speaking to the director of the commercial he's filming), and the film isn't for everybody (many people I know hated it, calling it pointless - which it sort of was, but when you think about it, all films are rather pointless). I found the bonus fly-on-the-wall documentary very interesting; Sofia Coppola's voice is a bit annoying at times (she always sounds so bored), but I enjoyed watching how the shot all the street scenes, for example, when they are forced to pretend they are just having a coffee at Starbucks (to avoid police problems) in order to film a couple of shots of the street below them. Also, you'll notice that the Japanese don't look or wave at cameras at all; the shots of Scarlett Johansson working her way through the crowds in the subway station are completely natural.

Bill Murray may have gotten all the praise, but Scarlett is the real break out star of this film, and deserved an Oscar nomination over the highly over-rated Diane Keaton.

In a nut shell, 'Lost in Translation' is a sentimental, melancholy, near-perfect film, heaped with brilliant performances from Bill Murray, a beautiful, elegant Scarlett Johansson, Giovanni Ribissi (or whatever his name is!) and a surprsingly good Anna Faris (although she is technically only playing an airhead version of herself).",1103846400,4,2498,4.711670480549199
1500172,5,B00005JMJ4,"Oh, my God. This is one of the best films I have seen, and I am confident in awarding it five stars.  Lost in Translation is so beautiful, so touching, so hilarious, so deep, so entrancing/enchanting.  Sofia Coppola, who wrote and directed, fully deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar she received; Bill Murray also deserved the nod for Best Actor.

Taking place in Japan (Tokyo and to a lesser extent Kyoto), the story is about a young, beautiful wife named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who has tagged along on a business trip to Tokyo with her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi).  Although Charlotte and John seem to have all the ingredients for a passionate marriage, John is neglectful of her in ways that are hard to pin down.  For one, although she spends half her screen time in her underpants, she and her husband don't seem to be having sex.  John is friends with a cute blond starlet.  John and Charlotte say ""I love you"" to each other many times during the movie - but it rings hollow, again, for a reason I can't put my finger on.

Also staying at the fabulously posh Tokyo Park Hyatt is former action movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who is in Tokyo to get paid a ton of money to star in a whiskey commericial.  Bob is miserable and can't wait to get out of Japan.  But as his agent says, Bob should stay and accept the invitation to be on the Japanese talk show, because you know there are no other invitations waiting in the States.

Bob and Charlotte meet and form a strong friendship.  Their relationship is so amazing; you feel like you have had the same kind of relationship in the past.  The sweeping scenes of Tokyo are what make the movie so fantastic.  Lost in Translation just would not have been as captivating if it had been filmed in any other city.  The film also serves as a primer for anyone considering a trip to Tokyo.  You see the inside of a hospital, train stations, restaurants, video game arcade, and a shrine.  Not many Japanese know English, adding to the feeling of isolation of the Americans abroad in the film.  Even the hotel lounge club singer is so isolated and lonely; you can hear it in her first song.

The DVD's extras include deleted scenes, which are delightful except for the extended press interview with the blond starlet, which is literally longer than the interview with Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray.  There is also ""Matthew's Big Hit TV,"" the Graham Norton-like Japanese host and his sophomoric ""talk show.""  The extra contains Bob Harris' full segment on Matthew's show, from the point of the TV viewer.

This movie has such a special quality that shows many beautiful aspects of Japan, such as flower arranging, and a bride in traditional bridal kimono.  As the bride retires, a Mona Lisa smile on her red lips, you sense that Japan has much to offer - but it is elusive to a foreigner.  It is the mix of modernity and tradition that makes Japan so captivating - well, that is part of the reason.

1500279,1,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost In Translation"" was unbelievably slow and boring. The story was set in Japan. The story was about the rising and falling emotions between a newly wedded young girl whose marriage has just passed on from the honeymoon period, and a 40 year old man who is having a mid-life crisis. The girl is bored in her marriage, so is he. What seemed strange was that the movie's name is ""Lost In Translation"", and since the story is set in Japan, you would think this might be some kind of love story between an American and a Japanese. But it turned out that it was a story between two Americans. This totally defeats the purpose of having the movie set in Japan. The only thing that is remotely related to Japan is when they shamelessly make fun of Japanese people and the cultural differences.

There isn't a structured plot in this moive. Mostly it is just random scenes put together, added by a couple of funny scenes of making fun of Japanese people. The scenes moved on extremely slowly. Sometimes it just makes you want to scream to the screen ""Go to the next scene already!!""

I totally didn't get this movie. I remember after watching the movie, I was just sitting there thinking about what I just saw and I tried to come to a conclusion of the movie, but I couldn't. I still can't.

If you got couple of hours to kill, watch this movie. But don't expect to understand it.

Sofia wanted you to feel what her characters are feeling.  There is major frustration, loneliness...why am I here...they are LOST!!! for lack of a better phrase.  Remember, we don't even have subtitles when we hear Japanese.  And Bob doesn't hear the whole translation (I can promise you that) when he does receive his interpretation.

Anyhow, I could nitpick on the fact that they have Japanese speak with ""l's""...like the escort that wants him to ""lip her stockings"" and the photographer that wants him to look ""lock and loll"" cos that is impossible.  It's not a sound in the Japanese language...they say ""r"" sounds and wouldn't need to substitute the ""l"".

The story involves an aging, washed up actor, and the young, neglected wife of a fashion photographer. They meet in a Tokyo hotel lounge and hit it off immediately. They laugh, they talk, they seem to fill each others void - seem to understand one another. A lesser movie would quickly turn this into the obligatory romance, but Lost in Translation is more mature. It understands the complexities of the human need for companionship, and that this need works on many more levels than a Hollywood clich. This relationship is what makes Lost in Translation so compelling. These two people need each other so deeply, so immediately, in a way that registers to everyone. That need it is something that transcends romance, friendship, acquaintance, and every other box one could place human contact in. Sophia Coppola has captured these nuances and complexities to such a subtle and beautiful tee, that this is a film that stays with you and lingers for days - even weeks - after the first viewing.

 To top that off, Bill Murray offers his career's best performance. This is an amazing performance, given by a real pro. Murray plays a role that is far more complicated than it appears. He is a funny man, a man who knows he has a natural comedic talent...but has lost something. He no longer feels the need to try so hard...he is holding back. This is an infinitely perceptive Murray and every minute he is on screen, he had my rapt attention.

Scarlette Johanason proved to be the only match for Murray minute by minute in this performance that shows that she is quite possibly the next great female lead of my generation.

1500491,3,B00005JMJ4,"I liked this film very much for reasons a lot of other people did not -- it included long stretches where no one said anything that implied a certain reality unusual in Hollywood productions.

I believe this created the aura of loneliness and alienation that allowed the principal parties in the film to find each other and blossom in a land where neither had a place or knew the language. The fact that both parties had significant problems in their personal life aided and abetted this engaging partnership.

This is the summary message of this movie, in my opinion -- that it is possible to throw off all of life's problems, regardless of their enormous nature, by finding the right person in the right circumstance. This is what the cohorts did in Japan in ""Lost In Translation"" and I believe they did it very well.

I've enjoyed many of Bill Murray's past films and liked his modest, subtle style in this movie. I believe it fit well with the overall scheme. His partner, actress Scarlett Johansson, played an intellectually bored young wife seeking connection when her husband left her, which occurred regularly. I liked this pairing. It was more realistic than the folks portrayed in most movies and certainly more intelligent.

This film isn't the final word about anything but it presents 100 minutes where you can legally stalk other people, see their personal problems, sympathize with their situations and feel good about the ending.

It was just a story  of a fading celebrity that finds himself lonely in a town of millions of people.  The people of the country are made to be as celebrity obsessed as US movie fans, which I found in poor taste.

But it did so well at the box office and the nominations?! Even for fans of Bill Murray's too few dramatic roles, I just didn't get the appeal...

1500494,1,B00005JMJ4,"Edward Said's ""Orientalism"" has been standard reading for just about every humanities course on offer in any decent university in the english speaking west for the last twenty years at least. How is it that amongst the hundreds of reviews that I have read of Sofia Cappola's latest offering I have found only one reviewer (a Japanese critic writing for The Guardian) who noticed that the film is literally overflowing with the racist cliches that Said identified as lying at the heart of so much of the West's interpretations of Eastern culture?

Since when did it become OK to laugh at the fact that the average Japanese person tends to be shorter than the average American person - a ""joke"" that was deployed a number of times and which made me shift uncomfortably in my seat, especially when everyone else in the theatre errupted into laughter. Where were the shower scenes filmed I wonder? Certainly not in the five star hotel featured in the rest of the film because there is simply not a five star hotel in the entire country where you are going to hit your head on a shower nozzle - the Japanese are too culturally sensitive to the requirements of Westerners to commit such obvious mistakes. A cultural sensitivity not reciprocated in this dreadful film.

Nor is it OK to suggest that the Japanese language is worth laughing at in and of itself. The purported verbosity of the language is in fact simply untrue, and even if it were, making a joke out of ""difference"" per se is tasteless to say the least.

The film fell into the same trap that so many Western cultural products fall into when attempting to navigate other cultures from the outside. There was ""good"" Japanese culture - flower arranging, buddhist temples etc, and ""ridiculous"" Japanese culture - game shows, incomprehensible yapping etc. In other words, aspects of the other culture that have been reinterpreted to the satisfaction of the West are presented in a positive light, and the rest is simply fair fodder for a good laugh. We don't get it so it must be ridiculous. Hardly.

Cappola simply failed to distance herself from the racist jokes that the film relied on for it's humour. Japanese culture was indeed ""Lost in Translation"" and presented simply as wierd, crazy, unintelligible and worthy of a good hearty laugh, as were the Japanese people themselves who insisted on yapping in that ridiculous language of theirs and being short.

1500596,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost In Translation, the second feature film from Sofia Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), is an amazing motion picture about life's little chance happenings.

Bob Harris (played to the finest degree by Bill Murray) is a tired, washed-up B-movie actor who is stuck in Japan doing whisky commercials when he could be out reviving his career or taking care of his distant family. He can't sleep, he's jetlagged, and worst of all, he doesn't speak the language. He just wants to get out of Japan as quickly as possible.

Charlotte (the fantastic Scarlett Johannsen) is in Japan because her ""get-up-and-go"" photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is on assignment, shooting local bands and the like. He is mostly gone for the whole duration of the movie (I would have like to have seen more of him), so Charlotte has to figure out someway to entertain herself. She just came out of college (with a degree in Philosophy, no less), and she's stuck at the stage in her life where you wonder what to make of it all. She stays at the same hotel that Bob does.

One night at the hotel bar, they meet, and immediatly click. Not a romance type of bonding, more like a really good friend type. They immediatly see much of what they have in common.

Most of the movie just shows what these two characters do to whittle away the days. Over time, their bond grows stronger, and by the end, you'll wish the movie was longer.

Bill Murray is at his best here in this movie. Even better than his surprising turn in Rushmore! You will never look at Bill the same way again. His Oscar nomination was well deserved.

Ms. Johanssen is an actress to look out for. She has stunning good looks, and she perfectly fits into the character she plays.

The cinematography is very dream-like, and although I enjoy that type of style, I understand some people don't much care for it. Most of the people I've talked to about this movie say it is boring, stupid, and nothing really happens.

First off, it is not boring. You deeply care about the characters by the time the film ends, and you want to know what happens to them.

Stupid...pfft! No, in fact this is a movie that does not insult your intelligence. It's a very thought provoking piece of cinema.

And on the subject of nothing happening, what, do you expect them to have sex? I mean come on, I am personally glad they didn't do it. It would've been a cheap cop-out to their whole relationship. Their relationship is not exactly romantic, it's more like father-daughter in a way.

Sofia Coppola should be commended for making this film, and she was totally deserving of the Oscar for Best Screenplay (which she won).

Lost In Translation...is great.

If you like this film, why not watch Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind?",1101427200,10,2749,4.620123203285421
1500597,5,B00005JMJ4,"I've read some of the other reviews.  And, as I figured this is a polarized group of viewers.  I don't hold anything against someone for not liking this movie.  But, I was one who just loved it.  It's a matter of personality I guess.  I would not consider this an ""art film"" exactly.  Someone mentioned Remains of the Day.  And, yes I would agree that this might be seen as similar.  But, to me the point was a little different.  That story was a little more tragic in a way.  I was left with a sad feeling with Remains of the Day.  In Lost in Translation, I felt as if I knew these two characters and it was just beautiful.  It must just be something you would have to have experienced on some level.  Not to say you would have to have been in the same situation.  But, to have felt this way at some point in your life.  The movie, to me, is about cherishing those tiny irretrievable moments in your life that haunt you forever.  Also, letting something wonderful be what it is, and not pushing for more.  The acting was the best.  And, Sophia has one of the deepest hearts in the world for pulling this seemingly simple idea off.  It's something I've never seen before.  And, doubt I'll ever see again.

1500598,5,B00005JMJ4,"Bob is an actor who is overseas endorsing a Japanese whisky, forgetting his son's birthday, taking a break from his wife, suffering from severe jet-lag, and lamenting over his career (or current lack thereof).  Bob is lost.

Charlette is a young woman, fresh out of college, recently married, tagging along with her work-aholic photographer husband, who can't sleep and doesn't know what career is right for her.  Charlette is lost.

These two displaced Americans wander the halls and bars of the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, driven by insomnia.  When they meet by chance and begin talking about their lives, an unlikely friendship forms between these two lost souls.

Sophia Coppola's masterpiece Lost In Translation tells the tale of this friendship over the backdrop of Tokyo's amazingly strange and beautiful nightlife.  The light and sound seems to come alive, pulling you in and sets a mood that lasts long after the film has ended.

Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give such convincing and fluid performances one may wonder if there ever was a script, and if they truly are acting at all.

This is a tale of a friendship that the audience knows cannot last.  It is one of those temporary, beautiful things that you want to go on forever even though they can't.  Questions of ""What will happen next"" must just be pushed to aside.  This is the story of a friendship, and nothing more.  As simple as that may seem, Sophia brings the story to the audience with such profound meaning, such satirical humor, with such a poignant relationship.",1101081600,10,1538,4.869230769230769

And was i right??!?!?! i must admit my taste for movies has changed over the years the movies i enjoy are some what slower in pace but richer in depth. Movies that gives a smile on your face and makes you feel you want to be a better person you get the idea...

Whats good about this film is the fact that this film is not heaveyly driven by the story, the whole film seem to free floating and when you separate story and character you get lost in translation... the film feels its not scripted at all you just sit back and watch these people interact with eachother in a very unusual environment(japan)...

but thats not to say the characters are pointless there is a understanding connection between the characters, they know what they want but do not know how to get it... lost in their own dreams and visions finding it hard to distinquish whats day from night... but together they find a spark of hope that pushes them on...

Bill murray is good at what he does just be himself and he does a great job on it... scarlett is sweet and innocent, but behind those soft eyes you can see maturity and determination... and japan seems like a wicked place to be odd and would take long exposure to get use to...

I know the story at some stages were building up to a sex scene and it didn't and thats the magic of it the director want to show more of character and personalities those 2 people have then just get down and get dirty...

this is a film that takes more than just watching to enjoy one has to feel the characters really get into them once you're in you would not want to leave...

it would be great to know what bill said/wispered into her ears at the end...

Not your average cup of tea here only your best tea set is worthy of this film watch it and get lost in it...

Not at all.  In fact, I think I would have felt cheated had they taken their relationship past where they did.

This movie was lacking because it had no direction, woefully poor character development, and did very little with copious resources to create a truly captivating story.

Frankly, I think most people didn't like this story simply because it was boring.

If you want to see two boring, rude, unhappy white people wandering around a foreign country while apparently appreciating very little of the culture and even less of the fantastic opportunity to expand their horizons, please watch this movie.",1100995200,11,753,4.944444444444445
1500602,1,B00005JMJ4,"this film was a snoozer. I have no idea why it got so much critical acclaim. Look, I love character-driven films. Unlike what some people here have said, I have indeed traveled abroad, have found myself alone in a foreign country, and I don't live in ""middle America,"" I live in New York City and I see plenty of art house films. And yet I still didn't get this film. Go figure.

Why? There's very little character development. I couldn't see why Bob and Charlotte were drawn together. Their relationship didn't evolve at all. You can do character development with very little dialogue and without tons of plot if you know what you're doing, which the director obviously didn't. Bob's phone calls to his wife were much more interesting than his interactions with Charlotte  because they illustrated the problems in their marriage. Charlotte's call to her friend at home was insightful, as well.

If you want a sweet movie that features two characters coming together and forming a bond, watch Garden State. Like this one, it was beautifully shot and has good music, but unlike this film, you could actually see the characters developing. If you want a film about unrequited love with very understated acting, rent The Remains of the Day with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.

Bill Murray is great in this, but he's still doing the same dry schitck he's been doing for 30 years. Scarlett Johansen was great, too. They just didn't have much to work with. Also, tangents would start and then be dropped. Charlotte's photographer husband didn't want her to come to dinner with him and his ex-girlfriend. Was he planning cheating on her or what?? I don't mind understated films, but loose ends are another thing.

On the upside, this film did look gorgeous; some of the shots were composted beautifully. The music was good, as well. And I was very, very thankful that Bob and Charlotte never slept together. But those good points don't make up for the fact that nothing happens, not even character or relationship development, in this overrated, pretentious film.",1100908800,7,2060,4.8575498575498575
1500603,4,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is a perfect vehicle for the kind of deadpan expressionlessnes that Murray assumes in his serious roles. It's more mugging than acting, but in this film, it works. Here, Murray plays Bob Harris, an American has-been actor in a lukewarm marriage, who is sent to Japan to star in a whiskey ad.

""Lost in Translation"" depicts the collision of the American and Japanese media cultures, making Hollywood seem tame by comparison. The Japanese, we are asked to believe, love anything Hollywood, whether they recognize the star or not. Along the way, we are treated to an inside view of the Japanese media culture, which is almost repellent in its mania for bright lights, loud music and in-your-face advertising. There's plenty of opportunity for comedy, as Murrray bumps into various people who treat him less as a human being than as a commodity to pampered, partied, posed and paid. Along the way, Murray makes the acquaintance of Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansenn, the newly married wife of a wannabe director. Their loneliness and isolation gives them a chance to find friendship and perhaps more among the faceless rhythms of Japanese urban life. Their September-May relationship is touching, not altogether predictable, and throws them into new orbits, giving the audience something to ponder at the end of the film.",1100822400,3,1344,5.109090909090909
1500604,5,B00005JMJ4,"Everyone seems to miss the point. Turn off the sound and just watch Lost in Translation. This movie is actually cinematic, that is, it tells a story in pictures. It doesn't need words to define its meaning, to interpret. There's a line by the poet Lorca, something like, ""Poetry is what survives translation."" Turn off the sound. Sophia Coppola is that good.

Another thing, to everyone who saw this movie as xenophobic and racially insulting a) other cultures do make fun of us and our big cars and fat a**'s and b) buck up little shavers, I bet you feel all the world's pain. You're sensitive and that's really nice but those scenes where Bob and Charlotte are faced with the ""difference"" and make fun of the ""difference"", its kind the point. That's what people do when they're afraid. It's true. It's part of the inadvertent neural coding that helps us to believe the movie. The scared little monkey in all of us believes that.

You know there's something wrong when the movie's idea of funny is when people of a certain nationality has trouble pronouncing foreign words accurately.

Picture this: it's an American kid's first day at a Japanese school. His family has just migrated to Japan. Obviously, he has trouble with the language. So, all the other high school kids start laughing at this. Him: Nar-nar-kar-wa. They: No, no - Nanakawa! Hahahha!"" So he goes - why are they laughing at me? Is it my fault? Eventually he gets severely depressed and perhaps psychologically scarred. Not so funny now is it.

It is beautifully shot by youngster Sofia Coppola following in her talented father's footsteps.  Murray and Johansson's relationship is exciting, intelligent, and incredibly plutonic.

1500687,5,B00005JMJ4,"Imposing Tokyo is a city of too much crowded streets and too much empty ones.  Down town surrounded by everlasting lights and continuous movement on every sighting, everyone follows their own path. I suppose after a while living here, you take everything for granted. It may become tedious. Its overwhelming technology constituted and penetrates every skyscraper and advertisement. A night stroll through this marvelous city aside a love one can picture perfect how intimacy can be achieved by huge surroundings of people and endless movement. Why? Romantic love between a man and a woman is a constant of two, a third one means crowd. So, this two are immerse on each other enjoying this touring through Tokyo. The strolling goes on as the characters talk, laugh, and fool around each other. Simple mundane seduction, the unique of it is in the difference of each others persona. In their sorrow and meaningless existence they are aware of this mundane stroll. They fall in love, no longer mundane but unique. Now they are Bob and Charlotte, not that lone Wife and the depressive Actor, what ever his name is (Bob Harris isn't it?). More strolling as the couple gaze at that Big Pink Dinosaur. Some jokes here and there, when at last they understand that they are alone with each other. That's all the comfort one needs. Still surrounded by massive amounts of people strolling through the streets (got the picture?).
To cheer you up, to hold you save, still strolling through Tokyo and its overwhelming architecture, the couple feels the bond. What a great time to be with each other! Bond together. Time for a Whisky. Cheers!
Wake up, it's late already! Got to work. Where is my Husband? That damn Translator sucks big time! Some fancy actress, I just can't stand her stupid smile! At least I'm getting paid for this commercial. At least there is Tokyo right outside the window. Tonight's plan will take us to one of those popular bars where you can be alone with your friends and have a good time. Karaoke! Now I know you better. I don't want to be alone tonight, so stay with me please? We'll share the sorrow. It's about the dept of your gaze and the sharing of our silence. It pleases me to be with you. Bob and Charlotte. Yours truly!
Don't feel sad, we'll come together again. Now Charlotte strolls alone in Tokyo, and Bob impatiently awaits for her to come back to America. Then we'll sketch a dinner or something and begin an affair. Remember the way we where back in Tokyo?
No stereotypes, no clichs, and by no means the standard romantic comedy formula is used in any to way to cheapens this carefully constructed atmosphere of lonesome existences and frailty of the soul. Reality is at every moment present to express a direct mood of despair. Sweet jokes and mundane speeches, just a man a woman coming together as in real life happens. That's why it's simple but sober script penetrates the viewer with gallantly and emotiveness. Never in this picture a glimpse of hypocrite manipulation is seen to force a tear in the spectator. Sophia Coppola's pace and cinematic composure is perfect and flawless. The acting level is simply splendid. Highly in shape, Bill Murray is the perfect muse, natural, complex, as far as I am concern, this is no acting but a real life person caught in motion. Tender Scarlett Johansson pleases the eye with every gesture and word, sexy and lone, a breathtaking performance my dear. The photography is no post-card but a realistic color depict of the great Tokyo gathered with an exact camera movement. Music to assists the images and increase the great balance achieved in this less that 30 days shooting. A.K.A.: Lost in Translation.
And so, the excellent DVD transferring offers DTS sound, Dolby Digital 5.1, A conversation with Sophia and Bill, the Making Of, an extend version of that weird Japanese T.V Show, plus some more goodies.
The climax comes when Bob soft spokes some words to Charlotte, gaining an instant smile on her face. That's one of the best depictions of hope ever caught in Cinema History. He comes back to the limousine with a big sense of fulfillment. She continues her stroll, alone yes, but with a huge gaze of happiness and satisfaction. Simply an unprecedented kind of beauty never shown before on the big screen. Then the end credits appear: Directed by the great Sophia Coppola, featuring the amazing performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, etc, etc.

1500688,1,B00005JMJ4,"A great movie is one that reaches out and grabs you. The Ten Commandments, for example, may have had stupid parts, but the viewer never loses interest. It reaches out and grabs you. The same is true with the Star Wars series. You may hate them but you can never get bored with them. They reach out and grab you.

Lost in Translation is a movie in which you have the absolute reverse situation. You have to reach out and grab the movie if you are attempting to understand the point. You'd probably have to watch this movie several times even. This movie is NOT funny. It is NOT dramatic. It does NOT have a message. It is NOT entertaining and it is NOT even interesting.

Bill Murray plays a 50 something actor in Tokyo who is on a losing streak. He meets Charlotte who is 25 years old played by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson and the two fall in love. That's about it for the plot. Automatically, I have no sympathy for the characters since Bill Murray is old enough to be the grandfather of the girl he's supposed to fall in love with and looks utterly ridiculous, as does Scarlett Johansson. His character DESERVES to be a loser and I hoped the two lovebirds would have a SAD ending at the end of the movie.

In the words of John Belushi, what ever happened to the Bill Murray I used to know??? I mean the Bill Murray who brought the house down as the funny soldier on ""Stripes"", the Bill Murray who played the clown who robbed the bank on ""Quick Change"", or the Bill Murray who made people laugh playing the mental patient who made Richard Dreyfus, the psychiatrist, a mental patient himself in ""What About Bob""? Perhaps he's ""Lost in Translation""! Please, somebody FIND him!

Even worse is this movie's style. It shifts from one pointless scene to another. All we really see are different areas of Toyko. Why make a movie? Why not just advertise Tokyo on the Travel Channel showing these scenes?

Ladies and Gentlemen: This is as bad as it gets! This movie is one of the worst movies this year and is also the most overrated movie in recent memory.

You get on a plane, a nap later and you're in a completely foreign land. The transition can be very jarring. Early in the film there were repeated shots of Charlotte perching on the windowsill of her high-rise hotel room looking at a bird's-eye-view of the Tokyo cityscape. Ever done that (from a high place, or from a plane during take off or landing) and wonder how life is down there, where all the people are coming and going? You see so much but know so little. That feeling is so much more intense in a foreign country. The space and time are confused. Once work is done, everybody but you has a place to go. There's no wall, but you feel caged. You feel transitory, not belong, out of your element, out of control. You can't even drive yourself somewhere. You don't even know what's going on half of the time. That's what made Bob Harris so miserable after just a day or two. The flip side is, being free from the mundane daily obligations that take up all your time back home gives you the time to think about, and inevitably question, the direction of your life and your relationship. You put two strangers, one man, one woman, in that state of mind together, things can get interesting. Bob longs for the youthful simplicity Charlotte has, while Charlotte craves the life long wisdom Bob possesses. As in a lucid dream, you're aware of your actions, yet it feels that your actions don't matter and carry little consequences. At the end you have to wake up and go back to reality, and some times you wish that you didn't have to. Even when you do, you bring back a new perspective that would not have come to you otherwise.

Hopefully it changed your life by proving there is more out there than regular big-budget fare, it inspired you by making you want to go see better movies (or even writing one!), and it moved you off the couch as you just realized that watching paint, that has been dry for years, just sit there on the wall is more enthralling than the film you just sat through.

1500777,5,B00005JMJ4,"This movie is slow paced. However I didn't find it boring at all. I loved the scenery and the small glimpses into everyday Japanese life, all meshed together with this love story of two people brought together by loneliness and uncertainty, with a musical soundtrack that brings out the best in all of it.

After watching this film, the first thing that sprang to my mind was that I'm so glad I don't rely on Amazon reviewers to make a decision about whether I am going to see a film or not. That's almost as dumb as asking a fifteen year old to sit through it and not go crazy or pass out. This film is too mature, dealing with grown-up questions, situations and problems that the kiddies here have yet to grasp.

Bill Murray's character is going through a midlife crisis; Scarlet Johansen's is tormented that she cannot seem to discover her purpose in life. Both are trapped in a place where they know no one, and understand nothing. They gravitate to one another and fall into a kind of love that is very unique, but also not at all uncommon under the circumstances. They don't pursue it physically, because they live in a real world with real consequences and have to respect the promises they made to people they both still love.

No kid fresh out of tenth grade will ever be able to comprehend these emotions... no wonder most of these reviews are from people who were bored stiff. ""No sex? No violence? This movie SUCKS"", seems to be the way it works with these Amazon reviews.

 Too bad. Maybe when they all grow up they'll get it. I recommend this movie to grown ups who like minimalist dramas and romantic comedies. If you're expecting a samurai to jump out with a sword, pass this movie up. This film is about human emotions.",1098057600,241,1736,4.481012658227848

Now I don't agree with this, but I am not going to tell them they are wrong, just encourage them to look beyond the perhaps  mundane plot of this work and reflect on how it so truthfully represents the actual experiences of everyday life.

Life's mundane, not everyday is exciting and that Sofia Coppola wasn't afraid to express that idea interested me.  That's what touched me, how real it was.

Now granted we all don't go to Tokyo everyday, etc. but there is so much truth in the way the characters interacted with the world around them.  They didn't need to be completely explained, we didn't need to know their entire background or how they spent every moment of their day, they are just understood and recognised as true people searching for their place in this crazy world.

In recognising that idea, I was able to feel a realistic connection to these lost souls, much more so than the characters in a typical melodrama or action adventure.

So, if you can appreciate the idiosyncrasies of life and the humor within all that is around you, you will probably enjoy this unique glimpse into these character's lives.",1097452800,4,1302,4.807174887892376

Yes, it's funny, people know my love for indie films, watching my share of unknown, but truly profound movies.  Yes I surprise them when I say this movie is utter garbage.

Maybe I had a hard time identifying with the characters.  Charlotte should claim the award for the most angnst-ridden, boring, pretentious girl ever created in a movie.  For the love of god, do something exciting.  Bob Harris, interesting, yet I found his potential to be hindered by this strange ""relationship"" he develops with Charlotte.

Sofia Coppola struggles to find empathy from a very apathetic couple (as well as the audience that's bored to tears watching this garbage).  Here's a good idea to make this movie ""indie"", add a few elements that other movies do and pawn it off as something new, creative, and anti-Hollywood.

I stole this section from Sofia Coppola herself.  It was hilighted on book called, ""Indie movies for dummies who are children of famous directors who have connections"":

-include obscure music

-non-conventional ending

-take a comedic actor and make him more ""serious""

-lots and lots of angst (you can never forget to add a dose of this in an ""indie"" film.  You'll lose cred immediately)

-silence, slow pace, and complete bordem

Then end it inconclusively, yeah, make the audience wonder.  You'll get the intellectual types debating about the underlying symbolic meaning of it all.  For the love of god shut the hell up!

WOW, what a sack of crap.  I'm lucky to have traded this garbage in for 8 bucks.  Never will I buy a movie without renting first again.

Do yourself a favor and watch a Jim Jarmusch film or two, Coen brothers, Terry Zwigoff, etc. etc.

This movie portrays Japan in an absurd way. The jokes are simply not funny. The ""serious"" issues are also not touched in a proper wasy. I simply could care less about Johansson's or Murray's characters. They are bored. They have some money, they are travelling to a foreign country full of history and culture for the first time, and all they can do is complain and complain and complain some more. The movie won Best Original Screenplay. Uau! How can it be?

Maybe the name ""Coppola"" has a lot do do with it. Probably, after testifying that his daughter's talents as director rivalled those of her talents as actress(be it: none), good old Francis pulled some chords, so Sofia could get away with this garbage,]

I hated this movie with all my heart (and that is very bad feeling, I know. I don't hate it anymore since I don't watch it anymore). But I hated not because it is simply bad, but because it's a fake product, a bad product, a movie that lives in a vacuum, advertised as a masterpiece and gaining such praise, when better ""cheap"" productions gained nothing. I'm a big fan of the so-called ""Intelligent movies"", movies that challenge Hollywood estabilished pattern of stupid action, CGI stupid effects, plot holes wider than a football stadium. But to see a pile of crap like this gets so much praise really annoys me.

Bill Murray is his typical dead-pan dull self projecting the same persona he has perfected in all his other films from his ""Stripes"" and ""Ghost Busters"" days. He is a straight man in search of a side kick to breath life into his act. He has not found one to date.

 The story is about a man out of his culture. Bill Murray plays the American buffoon stumbling into and around in a land (Japan) totally alien to him. Do you want an in-depth analysis of the story line? I just gave it to you. This film is not that deep.

 If you are a Bill Murray groupie you will love this film. If you are a Bill Murray groupie you need to get out to other films. Rent some films with Ben Kingsley in them if you want to see a versatile actor. Broaden your horizons.

 I am always in search of something good to say about a movie...ah, a colleague lent me this DVD so I didn't pay a cent. There you have it, a positive aspect of ""Lost In Translation.""",1096934400,7,970,4.105820105820106

This, right here, is an inadequate viewer. They are obviously looking more towards the sex aspect (or the thankful lack thereof) and doesn't get any of the meaning in the movie.

Yes, if you have a short attention span this movie probably isn't for you. No action is during the movie, no amazing plot twists or backstabbing characters. This is a movie quite possibly in its purest and most brilliant form, one that explores its character's emotions as you feel the same along with them.

And I would like everyone to know, I'm not trying to sound pretentious arthouse-snob here. I like a huge range of movies, it just makes me angry when people post on here they didn't like the movie because they didn't get any of it.

One is a fresh young innocent, just beginning her life and searching for the ideals she is hoping will come with time.  The other is a middle aged man who has ""been there and done that"" who knows the realities of the road the innocent will be travelling.  As Da Vinci used to study deformed persons and include them in his paintings, to enhance the beauty of a personal portrait, the director and actors in this film juxtapose the betrayal of youthful innocence (Johansen) confronting the realities of the world, with the hope that comes from the wisdom of a man who has already lived most of his life (Murray).  It is a unique film, a unique plot, and, its climax is a tender scene in which the two lost souls reconcile their disillusioned dreams by sharing their genuine natures, and, their own ways of coping with the vulnerabilities and mortality of the human journey.  It is not a movie for cynics, it is not a movie for harsh realists . . . it is a movie for those who are on life's path, who recognize that blind pessimism is no more real than blind optimism.

1500894,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sophia Coppola takes a minimalists, guerilla film approach to a bitter sweet story of two souls lost in their lives.  Set in Tokyo over the course of a week, the movie follows the lives of Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson). Harris an actor is realizing that his hay day of movie making is behind him and he now has to live out his fame in reruns and commercials.  Charlotte, the wife of an up-and-coming photographer has come to Japan to hang out while her husband, played by Giovanni Ribisi, is away on photo shoots.  Both suffering from insomnia, Bob and Charlotte meet in the hotels bar and start a friendship that helps both of them find what they are missing in their lives.  Charlotte, in her early twenties has been married for two to three years and has a feeling that the passion is gone from her life.  Bob, well into his fifties I assume, knows the passion is gone from his life but is just thankful that the whiskey works. Bob and Charlotte spend their time getting into diverse situations all in an attempt to find or hide from their lives. Shot entirely on location in Tokyo, the backdrop of the Tokyo nightlife helps our couple fade from their perspective realities, but never too far.  Bob's estranged wife and children are kept in his life by his cell-phone (which is portrayed as the only link to the ""sane"", non Japanese world) where as Charlotte is with her husband and reminded every time she sees him why she feels that sense of misdirection in her life and also the reason why she wants to make it work.

 The cinematography and Tokyo scenes are truly amazing, in a way that brings out the beauty of the city without looking like a tourist film or being clichd.  Ms. Coppola's use of beautifully organic country-sides and ancient Buddhist temples mix perfectly with the neon-industrial forms of the city. A strong Indie-soundtrack only makes this film more of an overall experience.  Backed by artists such as Bryan Ferry, Marvin Hamlisch, Brian Reitzell and various local Japanese musicians, the ""Lost in Translation"" soundtrack is as impressive as the movie and as indispensable as Bill Murray.  The story entertains the audience without playing to the uneducated; it allows the audience to think for themselves on the connection between Harris and Charlotte.  The relationship played out between Harris and Charlotte is never seedy or even romantically physical, but the end result is one that will help make their relationship stand along the line of Ingrid and Bogart.  The only part in the film I feel leaves the audience at bay is that we are supposed to sympathize and at times feel sorry for people that have money, fame and some influence and a means to cope with their problems. The nice thing about Coppola's direction is that even with all that the movie tells us, money can't buy everything, and that even truly successful people are just that, people.",1096416000,,2914,4.746534653465346

By far, the most common complaint about this film is that it is ""too slow"" or it ""has no plot."" Grow up. Go watch Fellini's La Strada and tell people that ""it sucks because it has no plot."" Film is not about plot. It is not about special effects or the thrill that shoots up your spine when Darth Vader cuts off the hand of his own son. It is about capturing the beauty and reality of life through a medium. The same is true with literature. Authors and Film-makers are attempting to tell us something, to show us something about the value inherent in daily life. But sadly, we have deviated very far from this vision. It seems that all contemporary audiences desire is a cheap thrill. Lost in Translation does not even make an attempt at elliciting that thrill.

1500963,5,B00005JMJ4,"Francis Ford Coppola was a directorial gold mine in the '70s, fashioning such landmark cinema as ""The Conversation,"" the first two episodes of ""The Godfather"" and what I roundly consider a bonafide cinematic gem, ""Apocalypse Now,"" only to fade from memory with the onrush of the '80s.

These days, Coppola is semiretired from filmmaking in lieu of garnering up the reins to producing. As executive producer to such cracks at, as my faithful film companion puts it, crap - he raked in the greenback for ""Jeepers Creepers"" along with ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" - it makes one ponder whether Coppola's mind is gradually withering not unlike Colonel Kurtz's.

On the contrary, as one Coppola mind dissolves into non-being, another has sprung from the smoldering familial ember. This individual is none other than his tremendously gifted daughter, Sophia Coppola.

In her most recent film, ""Lost in Translation,"" the Coppola progeny has engineered an aesthetic marvel of a motion picture. In a medium bungled by editing and cinematic relapse, Sophia Coppola has flung at the silver screen a movie that trounces convention. Thematically, ""Lost in Translation"" reads like a Saul Bellow novel; although effervescent with comedic spunk, therein lies a spiritual configurative that is the true heartbeat to the film.

Bill Murray portrays Bob Harris, a MacGyver-esque has-been who, due to his overriding celebrity status overseas, is offered a sum in the seven-digit range to endorse a whiskey product with a Japanese label. He accepts the proposal and sees the month-long engagement in Tokyo as an opportunity to slip away from the day-to-day obligation of a father/husband.

In spite of being treated as a demigod by the East Asian peoples, Harris can't slow the onset of midlife crisis. Sure, he adores his children and still feels a sliver of compassion for his wife, but the pruning effect of age is taking its toll physically and emotionally.

The luster of yesteryear has blended into the horizon for Harris, who extracts whatever grain of esteem he can while crouched over on a barstool slurping the very booze upon which he glosses his signature.

Fortunately for Harris, a magnum opus of beauty and charm is around the bend. The feminine masterwork is a soul-searching Yale graduate, Charlotte, expertly depicted by cinematic newbie Scarlett Johansson.

She, like Harris, is dejected by the insipidness that steadily encompasses her. For instance, her fashion photographer of a husband has neither the time nor the ardor to suit her needs. He cares more about the coloration of a studio backdrop than her yearnings for attention.

Eventually, Harris and Charlotte strike up casual conversation to the tune of a tangy rendition of ""Scarborough Fair,"" and what unfolds from there is a romantic escapade that would flutter the pulse of even your most loveless dope. It is a platonic courtship that truly tweets like a Beethoven symphony. What a brilliant, brilliant motion picture.",1096243200,8,2972,5.175

1500968,3,B00005JMJ4,"I certainly am not about to jump on the bashing-Sofia Coppola bandwagon. It is such an inviting opportunity to trash this movie -- as critics trashed Sofia Coppola's acting, in her role as Mary Corleone in father Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather, Part III"" -- because the director is the beneficiary of her father's nepotism.  Well, that is undoubtedly true, but I honestly think she made the grade with this alright movie. (To go out further on a limb, even though her acting was not good in Godfather III, she was believable as Michael Corleone's daughter. I don't necessarily think that would have been the case with Coppola's first choice, Wynona Ryder, even though Ryder is a better actress). Thankfully, nepotism exists, because I think without it, this movie could never have been made. Although it is indeed a worthwhile movie, there are way more talented people out there than Sofia Coppola who can't even get that so-called ""friend of the independents,"" Robert Redford, to give them the time of day.

The movie revolves around Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), an oddly matched pair, alienated from the superficial glitz and glam of the Tokyo film and fashion world. Like two lost children caught in a snowstorm, they find each other, and seek warmth and meaning in their friendship. Through random meetings and seeing the sights of Tokyo, they end their time together a little stronger to face the world.

A number of reviewers criticized this flick because ""nothing happens."" No, nothing ""momentous"" does happen; that is not the point. ""Lost in Translation"" is a quietly told story of, to paraphrase Thoreau, two souls living in quiet desperation. Which is exactly why this story takes place in Tokyo. All right, ""they're in the middle of Tokyo, and all they do is stare at the walls."" Precisely. They are depressed people, and often, depressed people are more intelligent than those around them. They need cerebral stimulation, not merely the obvious sensorial stimulation offered by the Ginza's fury of neon.

Most certainly, I was thinking Bill Murray was nuts for not having an affair with the ethereally beautiful Johansson (who is my second choice candidate for playing Madeleine, if a remake of ""Vertigo"" is in the offing; my first is Kirsten Dunst). Yet, many of us have had a friendship that, even though both parties are interested sexually, is far too precious for sex to intrude upon. A paradox, I know, but true nonetheless.

The film had a minimalistic, beautiful story, played by both actors with insight and understatement. I give the actors 4-1/2 stars.

That said, this was hardly a cinematic feast.  My reaction to the cinematography was simply neutral. It makes for a better play than movie. Some people are tossing the phrase ""Italian Neorealism"" around rather haphazardly. Please!  As a piece of film, ""Lost in Translation"" is to ""The Bicycle Thief"" or ""Stromboli"" what ""Body Heat"" is to ""Double Indemnity"" and ""White Heat."" Close, but no cigar. As a work of cinema, I give it 1-1/2 stars. Thus, 3 on balance.

Nevertheless, I hope to see more of Sofia Copolla's movies. I believe that if she studies the fine art of montage, she'll go from being a so-so director to a great one.

She can start by viewing the works of her father.",1095379200,7,3289,4.90990990990991

He gripes to the sweet young thing he has befriended that his wife does not understand him; even though she is a graduate of Yale and married for 2 years, she can commiserate with him. Sure. He proves his virility by a drunken romp in the sack with a redhead that he meets in a bar. In Japan, English is a second language, particularly amoung the younger set, but you wouldn't know it; which is ridiculous; even the translator has problems expressing herself in English. The movie is lost in translation alright, in fact it is lost period. I rented it for 3 bucks. I should get a refund.",1095379200,11,893,4.552795031055901
1500970,5,B00005JMJ4,"First of all, I found the movie to be very entertaining.  I love the cinematography, dialogue, acting, characters, and especially the scenes of Tokyo.  By just seeing this film I now have a strong desire to visit Japan.  And of course I thought the soundtrack was absolute perfection...My Bloody Valentine, Phoenix, Jesus and Mary Chain...awesome stuff.

I found the central theme of the movie to be a very truthful representation of many people living in our time.  I believe that the main characters being in a foreign country with a foreign language was a way of showing that they felt like foreigners in general.  They didn't understand why they were alive.  They were looking for answers but not really doing a great job of finding the answers.  They are not heroes.  They are regular people struggling to understand their place in the world.  The fact that they are trying at all to find the answers is encouraging to me.  Most films do not even bring up the question of our purpose in living.  ""Lost in Translation"" asks the big questions.  In that way I would compare it to ""Magnolia"", ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Adaptation"".

Of course the film also takes a close look at marriage and romance.  We see the obvious mistakes that they both make (especially Bill Murray's character).  Because the movie does not present them as examples I am not bothered by this.  When he sleeps with the singer the casual sex is in no way presented as a positive.  The movie both shows him as feeling ashamed and just plain stupid.  The innocence of Scarlett Johansen's character only brings this feeling out even more strongly in him.

The fact that the two never actually have any sexual encounter also shows that their relationship is not about romance.  This makes the movie totally outside of the norm in most Hollywood films.  Usually sexual desire is something you automatically follow.  ""Lost in Translation"" shows the negative effects of adultery.  Murray and Johansen never have sex though.  They are both seeking answers.  They find some encouragement from each other.  It seems clear to me that Johansen's character is especially encouraged to love her husband more than ever once he returns.  I think she understands that neither of them are perfect and that's ok.  Even Bill Murray's character seems inspired to go on with life through his experiences in Tokyo.

I could go on even further with this movie.  I could talk about Scarlett Johansen's longing to be loved and admired for her beauty (her karaoke song is just one example of this).  I don't think that is a wrong desire either.  Bill Murray has the desire to teach, to share, and to laugh.  The key to the movie is both are seekers, not examples.  If you look at the movie that way there is a power just because they are seeking and don't look for the answers in having sex with each other or some superficial answer like that.  ""Lost in Translation"" asks the big question about why we are alive.  What is our purpose?  The movie doesn't completely answer the question but it gets the viewer going in the right direction.

There you go.  There is no clear cut answer at the end of the film.  But that is because people in general don't know the answer to the question.  The movie is about seeking the truth.  And I love it!",1095292800,17,3286,4.661431064572426
1501067,2,B00005JMJ4,"I have little doubt this film depicts what it was like to be an American overseas during 9/11. Although it is never mentioned there seems to be no other reason for the constant inability to leave a Tokyo hotel, spend endless hours watching the tv, allow the camera to repeatedly capture the sight of Tokyo skyscrapers. It so conveys the feeling of being stuck somewhere that I felt increasing impatience and a bit of anxiety watching it. As it started, I was laughing with abandon at Bill Murray's culture clash with the Japaneese, but this initial amusement soon became restless as the culture of Japan is never seen as anything but a stereotype. Scarlett Johansson is sweet but dull as Murray's interest and Murray's character is soon diminished to a meaningless person as the director steers us into what must be her expression of 9/11.

Bill Murray was exactly as he is in any of his dozens of slapstick movies, only a bit older and more sedate.  I have a feeling the only reason he was nominated for the oscar was because he's been around so long and is probably very popular with the other ""stars"" who decide these things.  He wasn't terrible, but one can only make that same lost-dog face work in so many movies. Scarlett Johannson was very good and you did feel for the loneliness of her character.  The filming was crisp, the sound quality is good and there are a few chuckles here and there, but for the most part I think many people raved over this movie due to their inexperience with Japanese movies and were enchanted by the different culture.

1501070,4,B00005JMJ4,"As can be expected by her family name, Sofia Coppola does not disappoint with a touching view of two individuals from different generations whose lives are in the same sort of place, the feared limbo between deciding what to do with your life and fearing responsibility.

Though a little slow, the film is touching.  It was easy to care about both characters and see why they were such good friends.  But it is the comparison between the crisis of the post-college generation who ask ""What else is there?"" and the crisis between mid-lifers who are also not sure what is left that won me over

Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an aging actor whose career has come to a near stand still.  He travels to Tokyo to make his riches from appearing in commercials.  Feeling lost both from the euphoric environment of Japan and the fading long-distance relationship between his wife and children, he spends most of his leisure time either at a bar or trying to understand and enjoy Japanese television.

Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a young, recent college graduate who has followed her husband, an equally young photographer.  Bored and disenchanted, Charlotte wanders through Tokyo, managing a few smiles at the sights and the people.

Only after these two lonely hearts meet do their smiles grow and their lives feel less in limbo.  When they are away from one another, the two suffer from their usual insomnia and their frowns return.  But together, their smiles are almost consistent and their lives shine.

The genius of the film, however, is the story.  Harris is clearly suffering from a sort of ""mid-life crisis.""  But his situation is not unlike Charlotte's, who is also suffering from a similar crisis, where she is not sure where she wants to go next.  Both fear adulthood and wonder if it is really worth the risks.

I recommend this film to others who enjoy film as an art rather than as entertainment.  There are no big action scenes and no impressive special effects, but the story is like spending time with your closest friends and finally feeling life's worth.",1094947200,6,2070,4.80225988700565
1501071,5,B00005JMJ4,"This cinematic treat from Sofia Coppola is an art house film in the best sense of that tradition, and is so clearly not for everyone that I just don't understand why the Terminator crowd even bother with it. The negative reviews variously citing its slow pace, meandering storyline, open-ended structure and lack of conventional resolution are all spot on. But these are the film's very strengths, and the furthest things from weaknesses.

This film is about imperfectly real people, and portrays them with a depth and authenticity that Hollywood rarely strives for, much less achieves. It doesn't pander to hoary conventions or cheap passions, and its deliberate pacing and loose structure are actually products of the director's faith in the intelligence of her audience. She is counting on us to be both receptive and contemplative--sensitive enough to pick up on nuance and understatement without explicit narrative and broadcasted emotive cues. Based on the negative reviews on this site, it's too bad that her faith is misplaced in so many.

Art house films may test our maturity, but too often do so by stepping over into bombast and pretension. Consider ""My Dinner With Andre"", or ""Leaving Las Vegas"". In this film Coppola succeeds in coupling maturity with humility: she shows but doesn't tell; she teaches but doesn't preach; she has so much respect for our intelligence that she leaves blanks throughout the film and invites us to fill them in. However, this strands those incapable of or disinclined to filling in such blanks.

This film examines the undercurrents of life. It recognises that the truly vexing parts of life are not the Big Questions, and therefore doesn't proffer Big Answers. If you are looking for soap opera drama, you won't find it here. Likewise, if you are looking for a follow-the-bouncing-dot story, you had best stick with Titanic. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of blank verse poetry: it uses loose structure, unusual rhythms and absence of rhyme to evoke life's discontinuities. Its themes are subterranean and not at all open to mechanical analysis.

The search for meaning in life is invariably difficult and frustrating. We devote much energy to tracking down false leads and dead ends before slowly plotting out the few roads that lead to worthy destinations. This film respects that process by mirroring the journey of its characters in like terms. For example, much of their time is spent staring out windows. For the music video crowd, this is just dead air; but, for thoughtful people, such moments are pauses for reflection. Every time one of the characters pause, we pause, and consider aspects of their existence--hoping that they will arrive at conclusions that will take them one step closer to untangling their lives. It takes a special film to make a viewer so sympathetic to the characters that we step into their skins, and Lost in Translation delivers with a sincerity that is rare and heartfelt.

I would not dream of recommending this film to everyone. Those who need the comfort of formula, the clarity of spoon-fed exposition, and the reassurance of convention will get absolutely nothing out of this film and should just skip it. Here's a simple test: if you feel that, for a movie to be complete, the boy must either get the girl or sacrifice himself in compliance to some tired heroic clich, then don't bother with this film. You won't like it. But if you can handle uncertainty, meandering structure and understated nuance, then give this film a try. Among mass entertainment that assumes its spectators to be morons, this film's quiet eloquence and regard for its audience is as air to a drowning man.",1094947200,11,3676,4.99021207177814

On the merit side, both lead characters looked convincingly bored throughout the film (they were probably stunned into looking that way from reading the script).  That should explain all the awards.

Exploring deeper human themes like isolation, loneliness, and boredom this was an interesting movie, almost quaint and child-like in its telling.  World weary and tired washed up actor Bill Murray arrives in Tokyo and crosses paths with a disenchanted fledgling wife.  Together they buoy each other as they slowly become inseparable friends exploring the wonders or Tokyo beyond the glass confines of their hotel.  In a stand against cinematic convention, the two do not become lovers, if only to prove that an odd pairing like this can happen on a Platonic level.  Thankfully, we are also allowed a brief glimpse into the other natural wonders of Japan through the landscape and religious shrines as the twosome does their own exploring.

People who blow the lion's share of their movie allowances on action-thrillers would do well to avoid this one; they will be board to tears. But if you enjoy introspective, almost pensive films, ""Lost In Translation"" may be your cup of tea. It's true, as many critics and Amazon customers have pointed out: Not much happens in this movie. It helps if you have some interest in Japanese culture, and there is one achingly beautiful scene involving a wedding party in the gardens of Kyoto, as if, in the middle of alienation and commercialism, there might be found a moment of true peace and serenity. The friendship that arises between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, while played out against the backdrop of Tokyo nightlife, doesn't really go anywhere. Yet for some odd reason this film has an ineffable, lingering emotional impact. This is just a sublime little movie that I'm glad I caught in the theater, but make no mistake: It does require patience.",1093305600,6,1001,4.859649122807017
1501291,4,B00005JMJ4,"First let me say : Bill Murray rules in this movie, and it really is a good, warm and quiet 99 minutes ""piece"" - I just watched it. It's definetively in the league of ""As good as it gets"" (Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt) though not quite as good perhaps. These kind of movies are all about acting, and not about effects at all.

""Lost in translation"" is a simple story, but different. It's a love-story without the usual Hollywood-score and drama there to spice it up. But at the end of the movie you still are able to feel with the young married girl and the aged actor as they struggle to find the right words to say good-bye. It's the ""dark"" Notting Hill, though these movies shouldn't be compared to eachother.

I personally find ""Lost in translation"" as a very funny movie  as well, just the expression on Bill Murrays' face makes me laugh when there is something happening in the movie his character finds hopeless or weird. The man has a funny face! It's not a comedy, but I feel good after watching it. There is a strange humour in it, and I actually also find Tokyo-english a lot of fun.

As mentioned, these kinds of movies are all about acting. And the two main actors here has done a great job I think. Bill Murray as always is brilliant, put Bruce Willis in his role instead and the movie would be a disaster. But it's not.

Though it's a simple story being told here I admire Coppola for her script and talent behind the whole thing, this movie belongs in my DVD-collection - and I absolutely do not regret I bought it.

So if you like down-to-earth-movies between the great epics standing in lines these days, and if you're a fan of Bill Murray don't hesitate to watch this one. I know the reviewers here either love or hate ""Lost in translation"", but it deserves a chanse at least.",1093305600,3,1793,4.385542168674699
1501292,5,B00005JMJ4,"For some inexplicable reason,when this movie was in the theaters, I had very little desire to see it and decided to pass on it.

When it was eventually, released on DVD, I still passed on it whenever I saw an available copy in the new releases section.

The other night, while flipping through channels, I came across it on one of the movie channels I get on cable. I was about to switch channels when I decided for whatever reason to give it a couple of more minutes.

Those couple of minutes rapidly turned into the entire movie and I can't recall when I have seen a movie - without action or drama or special effects - that I enjoyed so much as Lost In Translation.

Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation is a wonderful story about the very special bond that develops between two very different people who happen to be in Tokyo.

Bill Murray gives a stand out performance and maybe the best of his career as an aging American movie star who is in Tokyo - instead of doing a meaningful play somewhere else - to film a television commercial, which will pay him $2.0 million.

Scarlett Johanssen is a young married woman - she was 18 or 19 playing a woman in her early 20's - who has accompanied her photographer husband -Giovanni Ribisi - to Tokyo. He's there to film a music video and Scarlett, because her husband is busy working, is essentially left to her own devices to pass the time.

Lost In Translation tells the story of the meeting and relationship, which develops between these two very different people. However, it is told in such an honest and life-like way that we forget we're actually watching a movie. What we see on the screen developing between these too characters is very special and the viewer comes to know and like these characters. In fact, you almost wish this movie wouldn't end.

I had heard the ""hype"" about Scarlett Johanssen - the ""It"" girl and perhaps that factor alone is what initially put me off about this movie. Normally, I am very skeptical about this type of label and rarely does the individual actually live up to the expectations the media creates.

However, in this instance, every wonderful accolade that is bestowed upon her is well deserved. She is enchanting as this neglected wife who is a recent graduate in philosphy (""alot of dough in that racket"" as Bill wonderfully remarks to her..!). Her expressive eyes and wonderful and spontaneous laugh are so real and so evocative that it's impossible not to be drawn to her character. I find that she is able to convey more feeling with just a look or smile than most actresses can with an encyclopedia of script.

And you can't say enough good things about Bill Murray, who plays this world-weary and throughly likeable middle aged man who's been married for a quarter of a century to a woman. Throughout the movie, Bill will call his wife and you get a real sense that the passion and excitement of his marriage has long disappeared. His telephone conversations with his wife are very short and she seems to have very little interest in her husband's stay in Tokyo. it's no wonder that he finds himself drawn to this kindred spirit - Scarlett - who is half his age.

I'm pleased that Sofia didn't succumb to the cliche to develop a sexual relationship between these two. There was, of course, real affection and trust between them, however, you sense that their relationship is far too special to sacrifice it for a ""roll in the hay"".

Since that intial viewing, I have seen this movie several times on my cable movie network and I find myself drawn to it like a moth to the flame.

This is a very rare and special movie and after having seen it, I now understand why this movie was almost universally hailed as a tour-de-force by the critics.

For anybody interested in human behaviour and interaction - which should be us all, it should be mandatory viewing.

A very special film and one that I would not hsitate to recommend / buy.",1093305600,12,3930,4.554609929078014

I thought we had moved on from the portrayal of foreigners as funny because they speak English with an accent and I found the scene with the woman in Murray's room all but incomprehensible (was it meant to be funny??).

 Yes it was boring in that almost nothing happens but that can be the making of some films set in boring provincial places, but, and here is the point, the film is set in one of the most lively fascinating and down right crazy places on earth. The idea of a fabulously weathly film star and an intelligent Yale philosophy graduate having nothing to do but mope about in a hotel room all day and then go to the hotel bar at night is plain stupid.

 I am yet again depressed at how Holywood treats a foreign land as just a canvas to spread out the neuroses of uninteresting Americans going through self-imposed crises, why set this film in Tokyo if all you are going to do is ridicule it. Mr Baseball was more sympathetic to its' subject matter than this film.

Its an obvious fact that American Celebrities go overseas to do commercial work where the American public can't see them since A-listers consider doing commercials here tacky.

Bill Murray is a boring man in this movie, he plays a celebrity, basically he plays himself, and he's filming a whiskey commercial in Japan.

This film moves really slow and its so boring.

Bill Murray's character is a boring movie star, he doesn't have any friends and he doesn't know what to do with himself in Japan. Scarlett Johansson's character is weird as well, I didn't like her either, if it bothered her that her husband was such a workaholic then why didn't she talk to him?

In my case, I didn't think I'd like the film until I caught it on cable by chance one night and got hooked into a beautiful film that has become one of my favorites. That said, I have issues with the DVD. First of all, there are 5 minutes of forced advertisements at the beginning. They are not the type that you can skip by hitting the menu button; you've got to fast forward through them for a minute or two. The opening screen even instructs you to use the fast forward button if you don't want to see the trailers. What is this, VHS? Horrible. On top of that, there is no commentary track. If you're one of those people that really liked the film, naturally you'd like to know more with comments from at least the director and maybe the stars. This type of film almost warrants it (especially when you think of some of the scenes, like the whisper). I expected to hear Sofia giving us the inner workings/thoughts/fun facts about the film with a commentary track, and was disappointed when there wasn't one. There is a half-hour piece shot with a home video camera of Sofia and the crew running around Tokyo, along with a Rome 2003 interview with her and Bill Murray. There are deleted scenes which are pretty good, but that's about it.

In my opinion, this DVD would fall into the ""acceptable"" category if it were not for the horrible forced trailers. Once again, these forced ads are really horrible. If you've got a DVD player that can fast forward up to 48x and can get through them quick, it might not be too bad. If you've got an older model that can only fast forward 2x or 4x, you'll be sitting there for a couple minutes going through trailers before you get to the menu to play the film.... every time you want to watch it. If you turn off the movie to finish it later and your player does not remember the location of the disc where you left off, you'll have to fast forward through the ads again to finish the viewing. It would not surprise me if some type of ""Collectors Edition"" DVD is released in the next year or two, without the ads, a director commentary track, and a lot more extras that this type of film deserves. With the double dipping that studios do these days (releasing a quick stripped down or acceptable disc, and then putting out a much better one later), it's almost a guarantee and I'll be first in line to grab it. Until then, I'd recommend this disc be rented at least once before making the choice to buy it or not.",1092614400,3,2583,4.358921161825726

1501420,5,B00005JMJ4,There is something about this movie that just makes me watch it over and over. I guess because most of us can identify with either one of these characters. I now see Bill Murray in a different light. I'ts nice to see how two totally different people not only in age but character can find eachother and comfort eachother. Soul mates work that way and they don't always have to stay together to realize that they belonged together in another life or will meet again in the next. If your'e reading this review it's because you want help in deciding to buy it or not. Well all I can say is it's worth it.,1092441600,,601,4.280701754385965
1501421,4,B00005JMJ4,"The deluxe Park Hyatt Tokyo provides the backdrop for this quirky film about the evolving relationship between Bob Harris, a world-weary movie actor in town to pocket easy money for a Suntory whiskey advertising campaign, and Charlotte, an obviously smart young wife of a thoughtless, ambitious video director. Through happenstance, these two characters come together and over the course of the film, discover they are soulmates.

This deceptively simple concept has been given a stylized and perceptive treatment by screenwriter and director Sofia Coppola, who has an obvious fondness for her characters and the setting. As a third-generation Japanese-American who has been to Tokyo a few times, I found the film was full of shrewd observations about current Japanese culture - the expansive karaoke hotel suite, the antiseptic strip club, the anal-retentive hospital waiting room, the Day-Glo Japanese talk show with the maniacally congenial host. I doubt if any other stateside filmmaker has captured the blinding lights and claustrophobic hustle of Tokyo better, much less the actual Japanese people in the way Coppola has done here without resorting to stereotypes. The scenes dealing with the communication barriers, while comically effective, actually feel authentic, not condescending.

Upon first viewing on its initial release, I think the film was overrated given its saturated airplay during the entire awards season earlier this year, perhaps as an indie-endorsing affront to the juggernaut that was ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"".  Now that a few months have elapsed, I can appreciate the movie more for its vivid sense of imagery and atmosphere, which does go a long way to compensate for the threadbare plot. The excellent soundtrack helps as well. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson perform their roles as Bob and Charlotte in an almost improvisational manner, effortlessly achieving a genuine chemistry. Coppola's focus on Bob still feels a bit lopsided since it ultimately makes Charlotte more cryptic than she needs to be. For all its charms, the film does not take ultimate accountability for the changes that Bob and especially Charlotte go through, which is why I think the film falls somewhat short for me. Though the much-talked about ending is lovely and seems to signal a reunion in the future, one still gets the sense that the episode was nothing more than a warm, dream-like episode in their lives. I guess I expected to see more honest character development for all the praise heaped on this film.",1092441600,2,2545,5.232843137254902
1501422,5,B00005JMJ4,"As you can see by the reviews for this movie, people generally either love or hate Lost In Translation.  Either you're made for this movie or you're not, but the film is what it is.  And what it is cannot really be absorbed in one viewing.  The cinematography and story line is so dreamy and subtle that you'll almost be confused about what is happening.  But if you get to a point where you click with what is happening in this movie, you will totally love it.  If not, you'll think it's the most boring, meaningless movie ever.  Again, read the other reviews and you'll see when it clicked and when it didn't.

What's great about this movie to me is the ability for it to take you totally out of your present situation and location and it actually makes you feel that tired/dreamy feeling you have when you're severely jet-lagged.  It is the ultimate escape movie, in that sense.  Add to that the inescapable Japanese culture at every turn, and it takes that dreamy feeling to a spacey one.  The film is full of these moments where you catch yourself saying, did he just really do that?  Did he really say that?  Whoa.

At another level, the plot of the movie is simple and the characters are pretty deep.  Unlike most movies where they don't spend the time on character development to create the feeling that you know the character but rather rush into the action sequences (thinking about Hidalgo here) or jump into bed (too many to list), in Lost In Translation, you really get to know Bob and Charlotte.  And the moments that they experience are many of the same moments we all experience at one time or another, but the setting is so dreamy that you admire them for how they conduct themselves.  There is some honor here that is missing in almost everything anymore.

I loved it.  But you have to be in the right state of mind, ready to take a trip of exploring a dreamy, jet-lagged, emotional relationship that is what we used to call a friendship.  It's just so different than most stuff out there today.  And watch it a second time, there's so much there.",1092268800,6,2065,4.470588235294118
1501423,2,B00005JMJ4,"I saw Lost in Translation with exceptionally high hopes.  I've loved Bill Murray's 'serious' roles, and the reviews had me at high anticipation.

Not since the English Patient have I been left scratching my head so feverishly trying to figure out what the whol fuss was about.  Don't get me wrong...it's not a BAD movie.  I refer to it as a Chinese Dinner Film:  I know I've been to a film...just don't feel like I've SEEN a film.

The story is about two strangers who 'bond' over shared 'fish out of water' in their location and their lives.  Bill Murray is typical Bill Murray, and Johansen is deft.  But the story is blah, and the performances, while good, are certainly nothing I would have been offering up kidneys for, as so many critics seemed to do.  Again...it's not a bad film...but the hype, I suppose, probably lead to the majority of my disappointment with the film.  I expected far more than was delivered.

Maybe this is one of those films that translates a much more intimate feel on a smaller screen, so perhaps the DVD version might add someting the big screen robbed it of.

But I'm not holding my breath.",1092268800,12,1124,4.537313432835821
1501424,5,B00005JMJ4,"Writer-director Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" is an exquisite gem of a movie. It is her love letter to the city of Tokyo, which the breathtaking cinematography captures in all of its garish glory. ""Lost in Translation"" more than fulfills the promise made by Coppola's first directorial effort, ""The Virgin Suicides,"" and shows that she is a major new filmmaker with a voice all of her own.

Bill Murray has given many memorable performances in his career, but he may never top is work here. Murray was deservedly Oscar nominated for his performance as Bob Harris, a lonely washed-up movie star in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Bob's career and his marriage have gone sour; on the phone calls home his wife and children are barely interested in him. Murray's best moments come when he seems to be unaware that he's acting, when the camera turns to his face and it is filled with such profound sadness it breaks your heart. ""Lost in Translation"" is filled with many tiny moments like this, moments that make up real life but are seldom captured so effectively on film.

Suffering from insomnia in the lonely Tokyo hotel, Bob meets the twentysomething Charlotte, played with beautiful subtlety and grace by Scarlett Johansson. Charlotte has been married for two years to a video director who hardly acknowledges her presence. Charlotte is alone and drifting, and in the night she and Bob strike up a friendship. Those expecting a May-December love story are watching the wrong film. Bob and Charlotte have many late night conversations about what life means to them, and they relate to one another in a very precious way.

Murray and Johansson play this unique relationship perfectly, making you see the humanity of Bob and Charlotte, how in their loneliness they reach out and touch one another's lives. It is a bond that probably could not exist in the world outside of their hotel, and they know it. So Bob and Charlotte spend all of the time they can with each other, but eventually it must end. The ending to ""Lost in Translation"" is oner of the best I have ever seen in film. It is perfect. As Bob is leaving to return to his family, he leans in and whispers something into Charlotte's ear. We are not allowed to hear what he says, and it's better that way.

Bob and Charlotte part company knowing that they have shared something very special that has changed their lives. In the darkness of midnight Tokyo, two lost people found one another, and it is wondrous to watch. This is a very moody, quiet, beautiful film. You may get antsy because of the slow pace, but stick with it. You will be rewarded with the miracle of Bill Murray's performance and Sofia Coppola's Oscar-winning achievement.",1092009600,13,2711,4.761702127659574

The depth of feeling as portayed in the script and by the actors is stunning.  I immersed myself in this movie in wonder.

I kept waiting and waiting for something to develop that would justify the acclaims it received, but it never came.

1501427,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is a great mix of Hollywood comedy and independent drama. It works because of Bill Murray's terrific comedic performance, and Scarlett Johansonn's role as suffering wife to Giovanni Ribisi (who has yet to give a bad performance). The film can get tedious at times, especially during a second viewing, but it all depends on taste. I am amazed at some of the bad reviews for this though, because it is well-made and funny, albeit not hilarious.

Lost in Translation is a sometimes funny, often poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human and finding yourself. It is definitely different from most films and those looking for a typical Bill Murray comedy should look elsewhere. This is a touching and beautiful portrait of a romance that could never be, with real characters, not cardboard cut-outs. Perhaps that's what turns most people off, because God forbid they see some of themselves in a film character. I loved this film, my date admired it and was 'wowed.'

1501528,3,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation was a film that left me with mixed feelings.  Urged on by the hype surrounding the movie, the awards it won, and the breathless recommendations I received from several friends, I decided to watch it; the experience had some heartening moments, but otherwise left me unsatisfied.

Bill Murray is the best thing about the movie.  A middle-aged actor, reduced to doing alcohol advertisements in Japan, carrying on a strained relationship with his wife over the telephone.  He brings to the part some wonderfully wry humor and a true tiredness of heart.  He really engages the viewer.  What I also liked about the movie is that it doesn't fall into the cliche of having the older man embark on a torrid love affair with the much-younger woman; their relationship is of a kind not seen often in movies, an unexpected friendship that has sexual tension in it but goes beyond the physical.  One of the best moments in the movie is at the end, with something whispered from one character to the other that we can only guess at...

I was disappointed with the Scarlett Johansson character.  She hits the same note over and over again - she is sort of blank and listless and lifeless.  To her credit, she does the most with what the screenplay gives her, but you're always wanting something more from her character.  Just as you want something more from the movie.  It's interesting to watch the relationship develop, but you always sense that the movie could have done a little more with the characters or given us something more to think about and feel for.  There are some sequences I found utterly shallow (the karaoke sequence, Murray and Johansson's night out running from place to place).  It really feels like the film is treading water.  I know the film is supposed to be more ""atmospheric"", but unlike truly wonderful atmospheric films, there's something about this one that keeps us at a distance, that makes us wonder why we are where we are, and why it is even important for us to watch the characters do what they do.

As the setting, Japan is used for the comical and the strange; it's a world where two lost souls can float around and ponder the lack of meaning in their lives.  There is one scene where Johansson visits a temple - what does she think of it? What impact does it have on her? Nothing, it seems.  The country sometimes seems to be little more than a cardboard backdrop, two-dimensional.  Johansson visits a gathering of Japenese women at an ichebana (flower-arranging) lesson.  She walks through the room, brushes her fingers over some flowers, and...? And...? On to the next scene...",1091923200,3,2625,4.714912280701754
1501529,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is a relatively slow-paced film, but quite interesting nonetheless.  Two seemingly-opposite Americans - Bob, a former film star reduced to shooting whiskey commercials, and Charlotte, a young wife ""forgotten"" by her husband - happen to meet in the same Tokyo hotel, and, despite the fact that Bob could theoretically be Charlotte's father, they find much-needed comfort in each other as together they explore Japanese society.  For those who know a bit about Japanese culture, the film takes on additional meanings, or at least the diverse elements of Japanese society are less foreign.

The film takes place almost entirely in Tokyo, which is great, but there is also so much more that Japan can offer that it is a great downfall of the film that so little time is spent elsewhere - and this is seemingly just to show the conventional shot of Mount Fuji, as the core ""action"" of the time away from Tokyo could very easily have been done at a shrine in or near Japan's capital city.

Unfortunately, Bill Murray (Bob) comes across as being extremely stiff throughout virtually the entire film, even in the ""lighter"" moments.  Yet, this also works well, a visual representation of just how ""lost"" Bob feels in Japan - compounded by events back home.

The cinematography is beautiful, portraying Tokyo quite nicely - especially at night.  What is most surprising is the sheer pervasiveness of handheld shots throughout the film, subtly disorienting the (Western) viewer in relation to this (foreign) society.

Unfortunately, due to two scenes of sexual content, Lost in Translation was given an ""R"" rating.  While these scenes certainly are realistic in terms of Japanese culture, they are entirely unnecessary and highly atypical of the rest of the film - and of the ""relationship"" between Bob and Charlotte.

The primary downfall of the DVD, however, is the set of previews - more than five minutes of material which cannot be skipped.  The best Universal will allow is to fast-forward through these trailers.

In the end, Lost in Translation is a wonderful film, and one which needs to be in the collection of everyone who has any connection with Japan - by blood, by friendship, or simply be appreciation.",1091836800,3,2226,4.986486486486487

At some point of our live, everybody have felt that sensation that despite the fact that we are surrounded by people, we feel alone. That sensation that for some reason we don't fit in a group of people or that we don't belong in a place. Those feelings of loneliness are described in ""Lost In Translation"".

 This comedy / drama is very similar to a movie made in Hong Kong, ""In The Mood For Love"". In both movies we are witnesses of a relation that goes beyond the physical factor. So at least we must give to Sofia Coppola the credit for making a movie that rejects the typical elements of the romantic comedy. Her screenplay is the most rewarded aspect of the film, also, Bill Murray's performance has gathered some acting prizes as well.

 ""Lost In Translation"" is a must seen to all the fans of the great Bill Murray, one of the finest comedians there are in these days. He gives perhaps his most mature performance to date. On the other hand we have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, a very young actress with a great future, she's only 20 years old, but she already has shown her great potential. Also, she is very beautiful and classy and she has won some awards for her performance in ""Lost In Translation"".

 Despite all those awards, ""Lost In Translation"" many times gives you the feeling that is more admirable than enjoyable, it's a comedy with a lot of original and interesting situations, but sometimes the pace of the film is slow and reiterative. For those reasons ""Lost In Translation"" is a good movie, but some details prevent this film to be a true classic. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people that likes the ""American Pie"" trilogy or owns some Adam Sandler's DVDs, but I would recommend ""Lost In Translation"" to the audiences that love independent cinema.",1091750400,,1831,4.635802469135802

Sofia Coppola's screenplay, which rightly won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, geniously integrates two people into a relationship who are not only alienated in the location they are in, but they are also alienated from their families.

Only by understanding more than just the few lines spoken but also the subtle body language and facial expressions can the full message of the movie be grasped.

I still can not believe I spent money to see this! The storyline has no substance to it whatsoever; this script is the weakest thing I've seen so far - one word, garbage. The characters never grow, the dialogue is lame, and in the end it just makes you want to close your ears and shut your eyes!

The ""artsy"" folk all sing the praises of a wonderful film while the ""normal"" people ridicule something they obviously didn't relate to or understand. Well I fall in line with the artsy folks. The film was gorgeous, subtle, sad, and uplifting all at the same time. I really related to the characters as I watched them gazing lonely and melancholy at the bizarre new world around them. You could really feel what they were feeling. Their loneliness and longing for someone who could understand was so intense and real you could almost touch it. I think Sofia Coppola did a wonderful job with her sophomore film. The cinematography, acting, and story were all Oscar worthy and I look forward to her next project.

 I'm sorry for the people who didn't enjoy this movie. I think it takes a certain type of personality to relate to a movie like this but it's certainly nothing to be bitter about. I've read posts where the people rating the movie as a 1 star personally attack anyone that dares enjoy the film. That's a shame. We all have different tastes and some are more complex (or weird if that makes you happy)than others and there's no need to try and insult someone over a difference in opinion.",1091318400,9,1272,4.526086956521739
1501597,3,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray displays some good comedic range in this comedy, but it is certainly not in the vein of a goofball Bill Murray comedy like Caddyshack or Kingpin. Instead, writer/director Sofia Coppola's humor is frequently so deadpan and understated, that if you're not paying strict attention (which I wasn't after the first hour), you will miss some of the film's funnier moments.

  Murray's character is a tragicomic character, isolated in a foreign land without family or friends and both loving and hating it. Scarlett Johannsen's character brings some interest to the film, although her character's relationship with her on-screen husband (Giovanni Rubisi) is sadly underdeveloped, and the film ends on a note of ambivalence, not unlike my feelings towards the film.

  While there is obviously some cross-cultural and situational humor, most is worthy of only a momentary chuckle. In fact, the entire theme of the film seems moodily subdued, as if the entire cast and crew of the film secretly had its water drugged with a depressant. The film itself is comedy on valium, and while it was a diverting and entertaining viewing experience with a few subtle messages on relationships and fame, I cannot understand the Oscar nominations.

The storyline is weak and amounts to nothing more than a friendship struck between two people in a foreign country...um...with a few stereotypical scenes thrown in of Tokyo/Japanese culture...and then it ends.  I just cannot see that the film possesses any deeper meaning or artistic merit than that.

1501602,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is a film that divides people more ruthlessly and completely than any other I can remember and the strength of the opinions formed by this dreamy and delicate piece of cinema can to say the least be intense.

 The atmosphere of ""Lost in Translation"" will be familiar to anyone who has ever stayed in alone in a luxury hotel while travelling on business. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a formally popular actor who has seen his celebrity dwindle to a point where he has become a rather sadder version of ""The Simpson's"" character Troy McClure. Unable to find work in the west he accepts an offer by a Japanese whiskey manufacturer to front their advertising campaign. Unable to understand exactly what his paymasters want from him, he spends an increasing amount of time in his hotel doing very little; it is here that he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), the Ivy League educated young wife of a celebrity photographer who is staying in the same hotel. Ignored by her husband who seems to believe that she is happy admiring the view from their bedroom window and waiting for him to return, her youth and sense of abandonment seems to compliment the world weary decadence of Bob as the pair explore the electric landscape of Tokyo a rather improbable yet compelling bond is formed.

 Sofia Coppola's first film, ""Virgin Suicides"" was one of my favourite of the past 10 years, so I really looked forward to seeing this. The only time I had free to get to the cinema was and early afternoon in midweek and as I sat alone in the darkness and watched on the huge screen I was able to interact with the image in front of me in a very intimate way and I thought to myself, ""This is how this film should been seen"". If you are expecting a fast paced plot driven spectacle then look elsewhere, this film is all about mood and atmosphere. In her sophomore effort this remarkably talented director has presented us the audience with a film that seems to distil the pure spirit of the isolation that many people in the ""always connected"" 21st century still feel.",1090800000,4,2057,4.612021857923497

1501693,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is a wonderful movie, gently funny, and full of subtle little touches and terrific acting. It's not the best movie of all time, but very well crafted, and IMHO, deserved its Best Original Screenplay Oscar award for Sofia Coppola.

The customer reviews of this movie here are really divided. I liked it a lot, but I can see why some people hate it.

Why do people hate it? Well, basically, ""Lost in Translation"" has none of the standard beat-you-over-the-head thundering action sequences, no stunning computer graphics, no highly detailed futuristic/fantasy worlds, no hot sex, no violence, no plot twists, no grand themes of good vs. evil, or the end of the world. In fact, there is not much dialogue, and only the faintest wisp of a plot as the movie takes on a format that is more akin to a ""Frontline"" documentary or travelogue. The most common complaint thus seems to be ""Nothing happens in this movie!"" (That was my teenage daughter's epithet for this movie).

 A sense of loneliness and being unstuck in time pervades the mood throughout this movie, probably another real downer for people looking for something uplifting to watch. Although the movie is about a relationship between a man and a woman, this relationship fails to follow the standard Hollywood romantic plotlines - a conventional boy-meets-girl love story or ""chick flick"" this DEFINITELY is not (and believe me, I have been dragged to enough of these). As many women seem to have written in saying that they hated this movie as loved it.

 And so, none of the basic formulas of the standard modern day Hollywood movie are present.

 Why do people like the movie? I think, first and foremost, the two characters of Bob and Charlotte and their situation have to appeal to you. One has to be able to have an understanding and empathy for their sense of loneliness and being unstuck in time, and also be able to share in their mutual joy at finding each other and being able to share in this brief friendship while traveling in a strange land. One also has to be able to understand their mutual respect for each other's boundaries, and not wanting to mess up each other's lives while together for such a brief period of time, in order to be able to appreciate, rather than disdain, the fact that they do not start having sex with each other, like so many conventional movie plotlines.

Yes, coming from somebody who's favorite other movie is Conan the Barbarian (read my review!), you might wonder what the common thread is between the two movies. Well, there is none.  Despite being a very direct, goal oriented, and driven person, and despite being a great fan of the usual Hollywood fantasy- sci-fi -action adventure CGI superhero movies, I also have wonderful memories of many friendships with women, none of whom were or became my girlfriends or lovers. And so watching this movie brings on an intense feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu; I can almost see the movie and relate to it with my eyes closed.

I would disagree with those who say that this movie was about finding your soulmate. I never got the feeling from this movie that Bob and Charlotte were 100% compatible, that they were engaged in a mind-meld, that they came to understand each other's psyche so well that they fit together like spoons, or that they had this burning desire to abandon their spouses and spend the rest of their lives together. No, this movie was just about two people who, by chance, had an opportunity to step out of the rigid mold of their regular lives and really enjoy each other's company for a brief moment in time. And then, through the same set of circumstances, they are parted again. They are together so briefly that they never get to know each other well enough to find out whether they would have made it as a long term couple. And that is what is so poignant and wistful about the ending of this movie - the sense of wishing for more, the sense of what if. But then again, better to not ruin this beautiful friendship by having sex and trying to live together.

I was fascinated by the interaction of Japanese and Americans in this movie; some people thought this was a racist movie, with so much making fun of the Japanese habit of getting r's and l's mixed up when speaking English. Well, there was a lot more subtle cultural stuff going on than just the language problem in this movie. In the context of the whole movie, I did not think that the language problem was overblown - this really is just how most native Japanese mash up English (just like Americans mash up other cultures' languages). Most native Japanese, I think, have enough confidence in the strength of their own culture to not feel embarrassed about this, just like Americans don't feel embarrassed when speaking another language badly. This movie was filmed, after all, in Japan, with a large number of Japanese working in the crew and cast of the movie. The reviewers who thought this movie was racist all seemed to be from outside of Japan (I haven't found one that came from Japan yet, and in fact, Sofia Coppola seems to be rather admired in Japan), and, I think these reviewers mainly have individual  problems with white American cultural hegemony and insensitivity rather than what is actually in this movie.

 Bill Murray is terrific in the role of Bob Harris. This is a mature actor in his prime, not the cynical jokester Bill Murray of old. I was a bit surprised by Scarlett Johansson. Her acting is terrific. With all the hype in the news media about Johansson's beauty, Sofia Coppola's natural, unvarnished portrayal of her in this movie was the surprising part. Very little make-up, revealing the small moles on her face, and in some close-up scenes the natural color of the roots of her hair. Some unkind people have written reviews mentioning a fat butt, but this is only if you like anorexic women, I suppose. Johannson is a lot shorter than I had thought, but well along the lines of, shall we say, a classical beauty, like Botticelli's Venus.

 The movie ends beautifully. Bob is set to return to America. He really wants to say good-bye to Charlotte, but is thwarted twice, first when she is not in her hotel room when he calls, and then again when Charlotte catches up to him as he is leaving the hotel. By then, Bob is surrounded by his Japanese hosts and you can see how their presence suddenly throws up an unbreachable wall between him and Charlotte. Watch their faces in this scene, you can see the tension, and then the pain in Bob's eyes, and the look of slight hurt and puzzlement, and then finally detachment, in Charlotte's face, as Bob gives Charlotte only the most cursory of cool good-byes while his hosts look on intently.

 I'll stop here, since I don't want to completely give away the ending of the movie, or get this review dropped by Amazon.com again. The final scene as Bob finds Charlotte again on his way to the airport is a terrifically poignant ending, full of mystery and an unspoken loss and wistfulness that comes only from the parting of a great friendship between a man and a woman.

 In our modern day world, fast-paced, and incredibly mobile and transient, such passing friendships happen altogether more commonly; few of these friendships lead to the sort of romances written into Hollywood movies of today. ""Lost in Translation"" is that rare movie which addresses this theme from every day life realistically, faithfully, and poignantly.",1090627200,4,7437,4.696620583717358
1501694,5,B00005JMJ4,"If you are a fan of big explosions, lots of silly one-liners, and lots of forced romance, then this film is not for you. This film is extremely different from most movies made nowadays; its plot isn't its main driving force, rather the dialogue is why we choose to see it. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansenn both do wonderful jobs in their roles of two lonely Americans in the world's most congested city.

 Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed up movie star who has been reduced to endorsing whiskey and appearing on crappy talk shows. His latest job has broght him to Tokyo to film a commercial. His marriage is in trouble, and his kids have ""gotten used to their father being away"". Meanwhile, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansenn) is a young woman with a workaholic husband (Giovani Ribisi) and an affinity for walking around her hotel room without pants on. She recently graduated college with a degree in philosophy, and she has no idea of what to do with her life. John, her husband, is a photographer who has a bunch of jobs going on in Tokyo. Charlotte came with him to spend time with him, but he is so busy that he only talks to her when he is getting new equipment. It doesn't help that an old friend of his (Anna Farris) is in town, as she draws attention away from Charlotte. Anyway, Bob and Charlotte soon meet, and a friendship develops. They simultaneously have a physical attraction to each other, as well as a sort of father/daughter relationship going on. They go around Tokyo together having little adventures, and at the end of the night they each return to their seperate rooms.

 There is also a comedic element to the film. In a sense, its Seinfeld-esque because most of the humor is stuff that one usually doesn't think about, although it is not laugh-out-loud humor. It will make you chuckle when you see these two Americans trying to blend into their surroundings. For instance, all of the hotel clothes seem to small for Bob, Charlotte goes places she doesn't understand because they are popular with the Japanese residents, and the talk show host, who is apparantly the Johnny Carson of Japan, who invites Bob onto his show is very creepy/flamboyant/annoying.

 This is not a film for action lovers. There are not many twists or plot points. The point of the movie is the dialogue and the situations. However, thanks to Murray's and Johansenn's fine acting as well as the excellent directing of Sofia Coppola, this movie really works.",1090627200,8,2454,4.695348837209302

These days, we have the privilege to catch a glimpse of how the movie got made, the scenes that ended up on the editing floor, the interviews with the cast & the production crew. Whilst this movie is great to watch, it doubles the fun to watch the additional features mentioned. Truth to be told, Sofia's effort is rather commendable for her second feature films. ""Lost in Translation"" got made afterall due to participation of the most under-rated comedian and actor from Hollywood, Bill Murray. Sofia even cried in the interview as she's still gobsmacked by the fact that Bill entrusted her to be the helm of this movie. She got the inspiration to set the location in Tokyo after her change of career from acting. My personal opinion tells me that Scarlett Johanssen's character is a real-life depiction of Sofia herself. When Scarlett's character talked about her been stuck & not knowing where she's heading, Bill's character assured her that in the end, she would eventually find a path for herself. It wasn't that long ago that we heard about Sofia's seemingly lost sense of direction when she bombed been an actress. If you have been to Tokyo before, you would probably emphatise with the sleepless two. There are many big cities in this world but none is as crazy & as mad as Tokyo. The buzz, the sound, the culture-shock, the technos, it's distinctly Tokyo. All the cliches are there. What made ""Lost in Translation"" special is the mood that the movie is able to portray; the charismas of both main characters. This is a movie about two lost people in desolation, lonely people trapped in their cocoon of circumstances & in their own special ways, they finally regain their soul & realising what truly matters for them in life. Perhaps, in the end, they both parted ways but the truly wonderful memory and their stolen kisses shall linger on for as long as they live. Highly recommended.

1501701,5,B00005JMJ4,"This film is not for everybody. The premise is not strange but it does have an exotic air to it. One reviewer here wrote something about it's lack of sensitivity towards Japan and the Japanese. I didn't see that. I saw a film about two displaced people who probably shouldn't have gone to Japan and I never was convinced that their take of the country was meant to be worldly or balanced. They were both their because of circumstances that led them there and their take was never meant to be some utopian ideal. The actor (Murray) was there because the money was too good (presumebly) to pass up. The young wife (Johanssen) was there to be with her new husband, and she did try to take in the culture and the sights. That they amused themselves in their boredom by making light of their circumstances is nothing more than a safety valved to compensate for their loneliness and apprehension about being in that alien place. As the film progressed they got out of their shells and had fun among the locals, and by the end there was no doubt that the memory of the experience would be a high mark among others which would sustain them as they continued in their lives. I really loved to see how this change came about as well as the sexless love affair that ensued (the lack of sexual intimacy put more weight into the affair making it seem somewhat more potent and on some levels more disturbing when regarding their marriage partners) within this setting of glittering towers, high tech commercial visual displays and little restaurants. The population, that was as varried as any metropolitan cities around the world, and despite the language barrier, were also the stars. The fact that Murray's character is uneasy and somewhat flippant toward his hosts is not because he's a creep. These people are just as shallow as handlers on the other side of the Pacific and my guess is that he's disappointed with that realization. I can understand that. How often are Hollywood and advertisement folks painted with a broad brush in the USA? I never hear anyone complain of that treatment. It's the character growth in this film that makes me like them despite knowing very little about them. I've been in strange places with a language barrier and it's often not very pleasant but eventually you get out, meet the strangers, eat their food, drink their beverages and do that weird pantomime with hand gestures and facial expressions, and, if you're smart, a well placed local greeting, and things are no longer very strange. One word of caution. Just because the critics like something, or, heck, even your best friend, that is no indication of whether you will like the film. Don't blame the film because you didn't like it. Their intention is to entertain people and not rob them of their hard earned cash. Next time pay attention to the previews (most filmmakers have very little say about how a film is marketed) and really read those critics' reviews and from a few sources not just one or two. For more than a few people who've reviewed this film I get the impression that they bought into the hype rather than made good individual choices. Never, never buy into the hype. While I like (putting it mildly) this film, I can't see why it was as popular as it was. It's not that kind of film. The last time I saw this happen was with ""American Beauty"". Another great film but not one that was a crowd pleaser. Both of these films are too layered and subtle to be popular. The viewing audience is not at fault for liking or disliking this film, but neither are the filmmakers. Chalk this up to bad communication.",1090108800,3,3607,4.61993769470405
1501965,2,B00005JMJ4,"I rented this movie last night with high hopes --like many of you, I'm sure.  I was expecting clever dialogue; good cinematography; better-than-average acting from the magnetic, charasmatic Scarlett Johansson and dry humored Bill Murray; and, for Christ's sake, an interesting story for once in a long while.  I ended up getting very little bang for my buck, and got instead an extended, petulant MTV video.  The goal of this film was for Sophia Coppola to show us her hip-ness --not much else.
The dialogue --most of it between our two stars and annoying, (condescendingly portrayed) miniature Japanese people (which could've been hilarious, instead of tedious, had this 'dialogue' not eaten up half of the film)-- was not clever at all.  It rarely elicited a chuckle, much less make me think a little bit.  It was clear in the first fifteen minutes that the characters were dissatisfied with being in Japan alone, but there were so little conversations of substance between Johansson and Murray throughout the rest of the film, that I wondered how they shared the strong bond that they did.  Johansson saw Murray as a father figure of sorts, it seemed (they fondled one another like dear old pals), but I really never saw that bond materialize...  It just sort of... happened.  That got to my craw about 3/4 through the film; my respect for the characters (and their creators) had fizzled to nothing after seeing them so enlightened by hardly anything at all.
The cinematography was done very well, I think.  The filters used made downtown Tokyo seem so clear, vibrant and beautiful --not too bright, not too morose.  The director wielded the cameras with relative precision, not eluding to --as so many hipsters do these days-- home-video-camera wobbliness.  It was, for the most part, stable (or else I'd've turned the movie off half way through).  I was more than happy with the shots of Tokyo; if only Coppola had shown the same appreciation for the people that she did for the edifices...
The acting was all-around impressive.  Johansson was her typical magnetic, mellow self, and Murray played the solemn, (perhaps) washed-up actor like few others could've, I suspect.  I do not think that any of the performances were worthy of awards; but I can blame that on the writers for not exploiting the actors abilities the way they should've.
It is so nice to be surprised by a film which you'd heard all the buzz about, and turns out to be enlightening, alive and brilliant --a pleasant gem.  Lost In Translation was indeed not entirely what I was expecting, which CAN be good; but in this case, I was disappointed by the lack of substance that many other contemporary independent films have been successful in acheiving.",1090108800,6,2724,4.891304347826087

...because their problems are trivial; amplified by their situation. When they return home they will probably realise that their lives are fine. This is a movie about two people put into the pressure-cooker situation of a business hotel in the pressure-cooker situation of Tokyo.

In my experience of Americans (and British, and...) abroad, many of them try to measure a foreign country by their home values. It's not fair, it doesn't work, and they would be far heppier if they just absorbed the culture, but they don't.

The aim of a movie is to generate emotion in the viewer. It obviously succeeded. Why should every film be bubblegum for the brain? If you watch films to be made happy, I can understand that, but you should obviously avoid 90% of the best films ever made.

Travel is great, it's one of my favourite passtimes. Even business travel can be enjoyable, but it's sometimes difficult to realise it... If you were on your seventh trip this month, in a hotel where you knew no one, and few of them spoke a language you understood, you missed your family, would you be looking forward to the next trip?",1089936000,5,4279,4.602094240837697
1501968,5,B00005JMJ4,"The relative difficulty of writing tragedy or comedy has long been debated among dramatists. Sofia Coppola here takes the unusual step of combining the two through Bill Murray.  Famed for his comedy roles, in this film his ability to convey subdued emotions resulting in a poignant story suffused with ironies.  He's an actor brought to Tokyo to make adverts for Suntory whiskey.  The shooting of the advert, a high point in the film, gives Murray full opportunity to express feelings.  Photo sessions, however, don't occupy much time.  With days of lonely leisure time confronting him, Tokyo's hectic scene leads him to find solace in the hotel bar.  There, he encounters a young blonde woman.

We've [indirectly] already met her.  Coppola vividly sets the tone of this film - loneliness - with the opening scene.  A girl's anonymous figure might suggest romance or even something erotic.  Her slow movements, however, convey a mood of solitude, strongly reinforced the next time we see her.  Scarlett Johansson plays a young wife in a strange land, her photographer husband on an assignment.  Johansson, clearly young enough to be Murray's daughter, captures his attention across the bar.  What follows should be entirely predictable, but Coppola's abilities prevent her falling into such a trap.

Over the ensuing days, Murray and Johansson develop a liaison - of sorts.  Johansson is clearly dissatisfied with her situation.  A recent philosophy graduate, she has no view of her future. Several wordless scenes of her wandering in Tokyo set her role flawlessly - a wedding in a Buddhist temple is superbly portrayed.  Johansson wanders, almost aimlessly, her growing despair palpable.  She is seeking something greater than what she has, but is Murray the answer?  She's carefully restrained in her dealings with the urbane actor.  She attracts him without leading him on nor promising anything.  The tension in this relationship builds superbly under Coppola's deft touch.  There is nothing formula in her use of close-ups and with Murray and Johansson, she's able to convey mood with deceptively minimal views.

Coppola provides an intensely human drama in this superbly photographed story.  In moving the setting to Tokyo, she declares her independence from the grim stereotype of ""romantic comedy"" almost universally set in New York City.  Her story [Coppola both wrote and directed this gem] is even more mould-breaking.  Dialogue is minimised as Coppola uses Murray's expressiveness and Johansson's pensive beauty to define the story.  This approach is far from superficial in her hands.  With no doubt attraction is building throughout the story, we  wonder 'is it love?'.  Both married, both alone - in the hands of an inept director or vapid script, every scene would be predictable.  Here, however, surprises abound, none as cataclysmic as the conclusion.

1501969,1,B00005JMJ4,"""I'm going to be open-minded,"" I told myself at the video store.  ""Even though it seems a little quirky, I like quirky.  That's cool.""  This isn't.  Despite its critical acclaim, those of us who are actually looking for a purposeful story in ""Lost in Translation"" will come out emptyhanded.
Basically, the film is about two American losers (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) who are in Tokyo and hate it.  They hate the people, they hate the sights, they hate the food, they hate communicating with their spouses--basically, they think their lives are unbelievably stupid.  Then, in a chance meeting at a hotel bar, the two forge a friendship, just because there aren't too many other English-speakers nearby.  They go around the city together, complaining about their pathetic lives and attempting to further dig themselves into depression.  This all makes for a deathly boring film that isn't worth a second glance.  I can honestly say that ""Lost in Translation"" has become my least favorite movie of all time.  It is so bad that I can't even remember any of the characters names.
So why do I hate it so much?  Besides its ability to put me to sleep, this flick is full of so many dark emotions--sadness, irritation, longing, depression, hate.  Bill Murray doesn't smile once in the movie.  If he and Johansson's childlike character can't stand their lives so much, why don't they do something about it?  They moan and whine and pass judgement on everything in Japan but never try to make themselves happy.  Instead, they should go back to the States, divorce their spouses, and do whatever it is they like to do.  Don't complain about their idiotic lives if they put no effort into changing them.  Instead of inspiring feelings of joy and excitement, ""Lost in Translation"" made me feel gloomy and upset.  Nearly everyone would love the opportunity to travel freely or appear on TV or stay in world-class hotels--I would do anything to visit Japan--and here are these two ingrates, in Tokyo of their own accord, loathing every minute of it.
If you do pick up this movie, don't even bother with the DVD extras.  The deleted scenes were well deleted (actually, they should have deleted the entire movie).  The interview with Murray and writer/director Sofia Coppola is just as lousy.  For as many awards as her original movie received, Coppola seems highly unenthusiastic about it.  In fact, she seems downright P.O.'d that she is doing the interview.  Murray is similarly bored and displays a bit of arrogance.  What for?  The end of the movie is exactly the same as the beginning--no closure, no resolution, no reason for existing.

1501970,5,B00005JMJ4,"I can't tell you if you'll enjoy this movie, I know I loved it but thats just me.  Lost in Translation, can be meanless blip in your busy schedule, a waste of Twenty bucks for a DVD collecting dust on the bottom shelf of your CD rack, or it can mean something else, something more profound, a kind of special connection you have that can hardly be decribed in words.  And these two different experiences of the same thing, both valid, both honest and true to the person expressing their view is due to how you view the world. The type of person you are is going determine what kind of experience this movie is going to be for you (kind of like life). I'll give you a little crib sheet (Lets assume you are rather intelligent or at least claim to be, since you are considering an arthouse/independent film), if you are very goal oriented, time consciences, a bottom line kind of person who knows the apporpriate behavior in all situations, skip it, this movie offers nothing for you.  I'm sure you have a very successful life, a beautiful house, delightful children and a movie is nothing more than entertainment for two hours of your day, where you can unwind. But for you other 10 percent who are a little odd, never really feel comfortable in your own skin, always feel out of place no matter where you are, and consistantly late to any appointments or dates you've ever made, you might be just the right kind of person who really gets this movie.
  Getting lost doesn't happen to everybody.  Everybody might say they have, or got a taste of it but getting truly and profoundly lost, takes the right circumstance and a special kind of disposition to get there.  And you'll know who they are if you've ever been there, because these people don't wear it like a badge of courage, they don't wear black, they don't become goth, they don't express how dreadful they feel. They hide it the best they can.  And you'll notice it in subtle ways how they try to act normal, try to fit in, and try to feel like other people.  This is one reason why I think Scarlet Johansson is an amazing actress, she hits this quiet despair on the nose. It takes a special kind of actress to portray a woman acting in real life. This kind of multi-layered complex emotional state is so hard to portray because most people aren't aware enough to detect this in real life let alone make it come alive on the screen. Some people believed Charlotte was merely a character bored out of her mind and I could see why because most of the movie she is blank faced, frowning occasionally, and smiling rarely. But you can see her distress in rare moments like her conversion on the phone back home, her meandering walks, her sleepless nights and most telling, her conversion with Bob on his bed. One of the hardest thing to do in acting, is to make it look like you are not acting and Scarlet Johansson does this exceptionally well. It seems like a contradiction and some people might think ""what if the person can't act, won't they look like they are not acting just the same?""  And I disagree because if they couldn't act, we would not believe that that person is feeling the emotions they are portraying, and the only way a person who couldn't act would be believed is if we all witnesses that person going through those emotions in real life as it happens to them, and that won't be acting, that would be real life.
  Bill Murray, what can I say?  He was playing himself if he was stuck in that situation. Maybe it wasn't a strench for Bill to play himself (ie Bob) but who else could have played Bill Murray better than Bill Murray.  The part was written for him and of course it fit him like a glove.  What couldn't be faked is the magical chemistry between Bob and Charlotte, and for a movie with no plot, that is everything.",1089676800,11,3798,4.4289813486370155
1501971,1,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is another one of those boring movies that gets praised by film critics who think it is very deep and meaningful. It reminded me a lot of Stanley Kubrick's films ""2001"" and ""The Shining"". All three of these films are beautiful to look at, but they are otherwise empty in content. About an hour into this movie, I found a book to read. Nothing interesting or exciting happened during the whole movie. It just seemed to be ""there"" and did not have a real story to it. What I saw in this movie was a middle-aged man who was bored and lonely. This movie really made me miss the Bill Murray that I loved in ""Ghostbusters"".

I sometimes felt a little monotone, there are now downs or ups, which can be seen as a good or bad sign. The acting is funny and good and the American actors have done a good job acting in a way that they are completely out of place in the strange country that is Japan, this is the best of the movie in my view.
The story is very good, about two people lost in Japan, a country with a strange language. This is definitely one of Murray's best parts (next to the Royal Tannenbaums) but not as good as I expected. I think Sean Penn deservedly got the Oscar that year.

About the widescreen verison DVD . . .
Universal Studio Home Video managed to taint viewing experience before a frame of the movie was ever played.  This DVD leads off with movie previews that can NOT be skipped, nor can you jump to the main menu while the previews are playing.  You can only fast forward.  This is the only DVD I've ever purchased that forces you to sit through their advertisement.  It is infuriating that I am force-fed this spiel watching a DVD (that I purchased - studio can do what it wants with rental versions)while in my living room.
The studios finally do something consumer-friendly (or is it just a strategy to combat pirated copies?) by releasing DVDs with sub-twenty-dollar prices and then take one step backwards by doing something as annoying as this.
About the Movie . . .
Chances are if you consider buying this movie, you have an idea what the plot is.  I give the movie a four star rating.  The most impressive element of the movie is how it succeeds in conveying Bob Harris' (Bill Murray) and Charlotte's (Scarlett Johanson) feeling of isolation in a foreign land.  Their relationship is seeded by this mutual alientation and the viewer follows along as they draw strength from each other to make their stay bearable.  The two are in very different stages in their lives and it seems their relationship is one of convenience based on being stuck in Japan, but we learn they have much in common.  Both are at crossroads in the marriage and careers.
The movie could have gone the easy route and become a ""Man-with-midlife-crisis-has-fling-with-younger-woman,"" cliche, but challenges the audience to follow two people who make a connection and slowly (and sometimes awkwardly) build a relationship.
Bill Murray is completely believable as a broken-down actor in Japan to make a commercial.  Scarlett Johansson is great as Charlotte.  A lesser performance and the character would have been reduced to the stereotype.
In short:  A good movie.  An annoyingly packaged DVD by Universal Home Video.",1089504000,2,2170,4.814016172506738

I don't think there are any other actors that could play the roles as good as Bill and Scarlett-it seemed they just naturally fitted into their roles. I love how their relationship in this movie was gradually getting stronger and stronger, it really kept structure to this film which I adored. And I just loved it. The soundtrack is unbelievable including the amazing Kevin Shields, Squarepusher, and many others. The scenery was just so beautiful to watch. Everything about this film felt so original and true. The visuals and sounds seemed youthful and free, yet both were having problems in their ""other"" relationship, and this paradox I found made the story more unique and interesting. The light jokes by Murrey were great, I just knew there would be some if he was cast in the film. Overall, the screenplay was well written. It was a simple film: no explotions, special effects, or gore...but sometimes the simpliest things are the brilliant things. I just loved the whole idea how friendship can happen between anyone, and can come and go so quickly. I just wished I knew what Bill's character whispered at the end.

1502130,5,B00005JMJ4,"I saw this film back in September 2003 and am now posting my original review.
""Lost In Translation"" is the best film of 2003 without a doubt. It is the most original film in years, and Sofia Coppola directs and writes with a perfect artistry. Now, here is a love story that doesn't involve the sheets and messy bed linens that lie around the hotel in the morning, the lovers each wearing robes. It is proof that a film romance can survive without the corny and unnecessary, conventional sex scene. Then again, Bill Murray in that kind of situation would be a little disturbing.
The plot of ""Lost in Translation"" is simple. That is because it is not a plot-driven film, but it is a character and dialogue driven film. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a has-been American movie star staying at a hotel in Tokyo to shoot a Japanese whiskey commercial. His wife and children back at home could care less about him and Bob feels unwanted and lonely. That is, until he meets Charlotte (played by the incredible 18 year-old Scarlett Johansson), the wife of a vain fashion photographer (Ribisi) who is shooting in Tokyo. He is oblivious to his young wife's unhappiness and sadness, and Charlotte is also lost in life. She doesn't know what to be even though she has graduated from Yale in Philosophy. Charlotte and Bob each wander the streets of Tokyo, and the making of the whiskey commercial is hilarious. Neither can sleep and they meet one restless night in the hotel bar, and they instantly click. They do not become passionate lovers, though. The two become friends immediately and take off on adventures in the city, being weary of the hotel. It is obvious that they fall in love, but there is no steamy make out scene and there is no wildly hot sex scene to go along with it. No. The film is perfect without it.
Everything about this film is just so wonderful. Coppola has proven herself to be one of the strongest female women in the directing and writing industry of film. Her last film, ""The Virgin Suicides,"" was also a great film, but this one is even better. Sofia has more control and confidence in her work now. The dialogue is witty, as are the performances. Murray has never been better and breaks his stereotypical image of comedian. Johansson has come out of the dark and will certainly be one of the best actresses in the future. She is already one of the best actresses of this generation, and her performance in this film is literally flawless. There aren't many characters in this film, and I could understand why an audience might be bored and leave the theater. Well, first of all, learn to research into a movie before you waste your hard earned money on purchasing a ticket. Second of all, there is a lot to think and understand about this film. People who don't ""get"" it do not take much time to really consider and think about it.
The production of this film is interesting and appealing. The look is fantastic, and the cinematography gets the audience right into what is going on in the character's heads. It's so charming. The music is very 80s-like and sets a perfect setting for the film. Tokyo comes to life as it never has before on the screen. I love it!
""Lost in Translation"" is a film about loneliness, and isn't depressing and conventional. It completely deserved the Oscar for best picture of the year. ""Lost"" is totally perfect, and the best film of the year. I didn't even have to think twice about that one.",1089504000,5,3440,4.576985413290114

Gangs Of New York, but I realized I also made a big mistake by insulting a decade I really really love which is my all time
favorite decade the 21st century. I did not know what I was doing when I wrote the one star review of Gangs Of New York, but
let me tell you I really and ever since I saw the film I gave it
five stars. I also really really love the decade I am living in
right now which is my all time favorite decade the 21st century.
Let me explain, I only wrote the false bad review of Gangs Of
New York to show my friends the dangers of what could happen If
we insult films of past decades, which is somebody could insult
our favorite things. They were insulting great films from the
past like Raging Bull and French Connection and I got mad for
I did not want them insulting classic oscar type films from
past decades. Make no mistake, I truly agree with them that the
1980's was a truly truly horrible, pointless, and stupid decade
filled with nothing but cheap clothes, cheesy music, and worst
of all mean spirited people. The 1980's were only good for one
thing that was movies. However, every decade has great movies, it is always a great time for movies. However everything else
of the 1980's was worthless and forgettable. However I realized
that just teaching my friends a lesson of not insulting classic
oscar type films from the past films only hurt myself. For I
accidentally insulted my all time favorite decade which was the
truly truly beautiful and wonderful 21st century. I love I mean
I truly love the 21st century and even when I wrote the one star
review of Gangs Of New York and accidentally insulted my all time favorite decade the 21st century, I did not know what I
was doing. All this stuff that I just said is implied in my
five star March 28th 2004 review of Gangs Of New York, that review features me saying the same stuff I said in my five star
March 28th 2004 review of Gangs Of New York. In the March 28th
2004 five star review of Gangs Of New York, I also implied that
Hollywood is still strong and it is still strong from this day
on. I also learned on July 11th 2003 that Hollywood was always
strong, you see I did not know at the beginning of every year,
Hollywood would release all the stuff nobody is interested in
seeing first, and than by mid February they start to release the
exciting stuff. After that, I felt so bad that I wanted to erase
that one star review of Gangs Of New York, but it would not let
me erase the review and I tried to work out the problem for hours but nothing happened. I forgot about it for months, but at
the time I was feeling sad for a few days that I insulted a
decade I truly I mean truly loved which is the wonderful and
beautiful 21st century. However during July 2003, I could not
remember If I wrote an apology review for it still did not warn
my friends of the dangers, but I was feeling better for I was
watching my favorite films, music, and HBO TV from my all time
favorite decade the 21st century. From than on I felt great,
Than on March 28th 2004, I decides to write what I truly truly
thought of Gangs Of New York and my all time favorite decade the
21st century. I wrote down with enthusiasm and honesty that I
not only truly truly love Gangs Of New York, but that I also
truly truly loved my all time favorite decade the 21st century.
Make no mistake I have always loved my all time favorite decade
the 21st century, from the start to present day. I also love
living in my all time favorite decade the 21st century, where
people are nice, and their is truly truly awesome technology
like the internet, DVD players, and Playstation 2. The 1980's
was a horrible, pointless, and stupid decade for it also has
none of the stuff the awesome 21st century had. My all time
favorite decade is the 21st century which is also the one I am
growing up in. I love the 21st century for people are nice, we
have the internet, DVD players, and Playstation 2. I love my
all time favorite decade which is the 21st century, in face I
own the great movies from the 21st century. I own all the DVD's
of the great movies from the 21st century. That is everything
from Erin Brockovich to Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King.
I am telling you the honest honest truth. I love the 21st century, it is my all time favorite decade. I am proud to live
in the 21st century, we get the internet, DVD players, and
Playstation 2. Plus HBO TV is great my favorite ones are The
Sopranos, Oz, Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and of course Deadwood. I also love the HBO miniseries Band Of Brothers
and Angels In America. Plus people are really nice in my all time favorite decade the 21st century. I am truly being honest
with everything I just said in my review, which is the same thing I did with my March 28th 2004 review of Gangs Of New York.
I am also being honest I mean truly honest I love I mean really
really love the beautiful and wonderful 21st century, which is
my all time favorite decade of all time. All in all the 21st
century is awesome. Long live the 21st century.

If you are a simple ""Meat & Potatoes"" kind of movie-goer, this probably isn't the film for you. However, if you can ""get"" the movie, it is an amazing cinematic experience. I believe the main key to this film's success is being shot on location in Tokyo. Had it been shot in a studio with some backdrops or post-production CG, it wouldn't have been nearly as good. The camera exposes Tokyo's foreign beauty and mystery all wrapped up in one. On the note of camera, the story of ""Lost In Translation"" isn't so much told by the character's dialogue - - in fact, there is very little dialogue at all. Rather, it is told via the camera, and I think this is where alot of people get lost (no pun intended). People are looking for some kind of solid story in the script between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, but it just doesn't happen. You need to look at how the camera is used during a scene, and what it exposes to you, that will make you enjoy the film. I will admit it's kind of an ""artsy"" movie, but thats what makes it so good. It makes a statement without coming out and blasting it over the screen. It makes you take a hard look at the film to try and understand it. It makes you pay attention to more than just dialogue to understand the story.

No he never physically does anything, but his attitude is pitiful, selfish and lacks depth. Her character is a total snore. She is a self-pitying early 20s nobody who has nothing to offer (no interests, no direction, no insights).
The worst part is that Coppola renders a wondrous and interesting society in a flat, 2-dimensional and dismissive manner. Are the Japanese portrayed in a realistic fashion at all? Coppola resorts to banal stereotypes of psychophantic, bowing no-ones, submissive women eager to please any man of power and faceless shills. She truly shows a total misunderstanding of modern Japan and its cultural shifts reverting back to her own preconceptions that are woefully off-target. Nice work.",1088985600,15,1597,5.007518796992481

But that's as much praise as I can muster.  If this movie had a script at all, the dialogue couldn't have been anything more than a weak suggestion. It  seemed as though Sophia Coppola just showed the actors her story board and told them to go improvise.  For all the Oscar buzz it received, ""Lost in Translation"" is the 2003 version of a ""Blair Witch Project"" disappointment.",1088985600,7,530,4.717391304347826
1502234,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola has created a remarkably human work that touches on the very connections of the human soul.  Every time I've viewed this film I've found different things to appreciate, and different perspectives in which to view it.  It is an incredibly deep, but easily enjoyable and relatable film.
 The entire movie focuses on the relationship between a washed up old actor(Bill Murray) and a college graduate with a workaholic husband(Scarlett Johansson).  The actor, Bob Harris, is in Tokyo shooting commercials for a brand of whiskey.  Charlotte(Johansson), is there with her husband because she ""had nothing better to do.""  The two get to know each other over chance encounters at the hotel bar, and then find themselves spending much of their time together.  They develop a close relationship, but Bob knows eventually he must leave.  Much of the beauty of this film lies in its exploration of the bond between Bob and Charlotte.  The film succeeds due in part to its focus solely on this relationship over a brief period of time.  Coppola doesn't try to take on too much, which allows her to explore the beauty of these two lives intertwined much more effectively.
 The film is also effective because of the superb performances of its two main actors.  Bill Murray was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and deserves to win.  He puts on a stunning performance that is both sardonically funny, and touching.  The young Scarlett Johansson is shockingly talented, as shown in this world.  Upon my repeated viewings, I came to realize each time that her performance was a larger part of my enjoyment of the film than I had previously thought.  Both Murray and Johansson surprised me: Murray because I did not know he could take on a serious role with such brilliance, and Johansson because of her youth, and no previous work of note aside from her good performance in Ghost World, which still was nothing compared to this.  The film is not really a comedy, though it has been billed as such at the Golden Globes.  That is alright, however, as it allowed it to win best picture there.  At heart though, Lost In Translation is a drama.  It is a drama that will make you laugh a little, but it is still a drama.  It is certainly one of the top films this year, and in fact one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is truly original, and I cannot think of any real comparison for it.
I have attempted not to give too much away, but I will say that Bob and Charlotte's relationship stems not only from their loneliness, but from their attempts to deal with problems associated with different stages in life.  Charlotte is attempting to find herself, saying, ""I don't know what I'm supposed to be.""  Bob is having a sort of mid-life crisis, admitting, ""I was thinking of buying a Porsche.""  Charlotte and Bob help each other through their unique crises and while they are with each other even seem happy.  It is this connection that the film explores so brilliantly.  It shows us the weakness of these characters, and their need for something to help them through it.  And they find what they need in each other, even if it is for a short period of time.  I will not spoil the ending, but only say that the ambiguity of the final scenes only adds to the brilliance of this film.  Sofia Coppola has created a masterpiece.",1088899200,6,3330,4.642735042735043
1502235,1,B00005JMJ4,"This movie taught me some valuable lessons. Don't believe that awards only go to the truly deserving. And that is probably more true of the Academy Awards than any other. I know that the other screenwriters whose works were up against this one had to be shaking their collective heads. There could not have been a screenplay here unless it was one that only consisted of camera angles, because there is no story here. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson do a commendable job with nothing to work with. As another reviewer said, turn it off after the first 5-10 minutes- you've seen the best of the movie in that time. The second lesson learned was never, ever buy a movie like this without renting it first. I wish I had heeded that advice myself.",1088899200,10,746,4.574626865671642
1502236,4,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola's second feature film ""Lost in Translation"" skillfully and stylishly depicts joint alienation of two improbable American soulmates, temporarily dwelling in a splashy Tokyo hotel. In the material-crazy world, actor Bob Harris (the excellent Bill Murray) and ex-philosophy student Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, just 18 in her breakthrough performance) gradually discover they have something in common. They don't lack money, they feel lost among people they do not understand -- both literally and opinion-wise.
The film is deliberately slow-paced, atmospheric rather than plot-driven, which is not a bad thing at all. But the problem is that there's not much substance under the glossy, professionally-made surface. The movie is generous in offering life's numerous little ironies, but these subtle, fragile, thought-provoking aspects are often outweighed by comic situations with ""funny"" Japanese people. These scenes are laugh-making alright, yet a bit cheap. Camerawork floods us with colours and stunning images, the soundtrack of state-of-the-art tunes compounds the alienation of true humanity in the current jungle. However, the result is that ""Lost in Translation"" can make you feel not lost, but a bit bored. But film lovers -- just for the record of all those awards it garnered -- should not miss it.",1088899200,,1325,5.63
1502237,5,B00005JMJ4,"This film is not for everyone and that is OK.  I think most people should see it and form their own opinion on the movie itself regardless of what others are saying.  My favorite part of the movie is that is a realistic portrayl of life unlike 90% of the movies made.  I have a hard time connecting with movies that I have nothing in common with.  Most movies always have a happy ending where a love relationship is formed in two days, the good looking hero beats the ugly villan, and rarely am I able to connect and honestly feel moved about it.  There is nothing wrong with that formula, but there is not enough balance in movies today.  This movie has incredible cimematography, there is just enough subtle humor for me at least, and the acting is great.  Also, the filmmaker captured the emotion of the actors which doesn't happen in enough movies.  When I say it is realistic, I mean that this could happen to a lot of people in their daily life.  This is just a glimpse of two different people's lives meeting and what happens in that brief period of time.  Most movies would turn it into a wild love affair or have the two characters spend the rest of their lives together.  This shows a story that has a much better chance of being something the viewer could experience.  This movie isn't Indepence Day, Forest Gump, or the Fast and Furious, but rather one that stands on its own as being a good film.  You'll either love it or hate it, but I think it is always positive when art evokes such a strong reaction and thats where this movie succeds.

Well are you in for a slow-moving piece of mood music. Yes, if you keep in mind that it's about loneliness, etc. and there's a great performance by Bill Murray, and you have a couple of hours to kill without wanting any recompense, go ahead and watch it. It does succeed in immersing you in its molasses-paced arthouse study of whatever it is the critics said it was a study of, but it's hardly hilarious.
Sure, Murray might have turned in a great performance. But so what? It's like following a complete stranger around for a week, and not a terribly interesting one at that. His subtle performance is stretched out over too much time.
You might have guessed I don't have much patience for movies that don't go anywhere in two hours. You might also have guessed I'm not paid to watch stuff like this, but instead have to pay for the privilege.

1502367,2,B00005JMJ4,"It was okay, but there were so many glaring inconsistencies that it made no sense.  We are supposed to believe that Charlotte graduated from Yale 2 years ago and was married 3 years ago... when is the last time that a Junior at Yale got married?  And while she was at Yale, how was her boyfriend/fiance/husband being a hotshot LA photographer?  Why wouldn't they have waited until she was graduated, if they couldn't even live together until then?
This might seem really minor, but it bothered me for the whole movie.  How could I believe in the actions and motivations (and it is very much a movie about actions, or lack thereof, and motivations) when there was such a tremendous aspect of the character's life that made no sense whatsoever?
The movie was beautifully shot, and you definately get a sense of the isolation.  There are a few very good lines.  The actors are all great.  It is worth seeing, if only to decide for yourself if the hye is worth it.  I didn't think that it was, but I'm aware that's not a popular opinion.",1088726400,5,1033,4.516129032258065

It captures that feeling of drifting apart, feeling out of sync with the rest of the world so perfectly, you'll get chills, I swear. Bill Murray envelops his usual slapstick sarcasm with a warmth and wisdom-his performance is absolutely superb. Scarlett Johansson is a beautiful young woman, and her acting is lovely. The on screen relationship between the two actors is the centerpiece of the movie-and a touching and beautiful thing to behold. All in all, this is a cinematic marvel I won't soon forget.

Coppola establishes the disconnected state of the main characters quickly.  She uses darkness and spatial constraints as motifs for the isolation.  Nearly all of Murray and Johansson's critical interactions take place at night or in a hotel room.  We only escape the darkness when Johansson contemplates at temples and of course, at the devastatingly beautiful ending.  Some may criticize this ending, but to me it was heart-pounding and believable considering the connection the two had.  Coppola does provide moments of unbridled joy that, juxtaposed with her portrayal of ineffable longing, become all the more intense.
I could go on analyzing this for hours.  This will be a film for the ages, and we are fortunate that we can see it now.",1088553600,6,1018,5.127272727272727

It had won a handful of Golden Globes, and Sofia Coppola was the favorite for the Oscar for original screenplay. However, when it was over it left me wondering just what everyone saw in it. Particularly Bill Murray's performance -- it seemed to me all he did was sit around with a sad look on his face while he recited some dialogue in a bland tone. Apparently these days it's enough to win awards.
The main fault of this movie is its lack of plot. Lack of plot doesn't necessarily mean a movie is done for -- if it can make up for it with interesting and engaging characters. ""Lost In Translation"" neither has a plot nor interesting characters. Simply put, it's a boring movie. I do admire it, though -- the shots of Tokyo are breathtaking, and Scarlett Johansson shows amazing potential as an actress. Since she's only 19, we have many great things to expect from her. Some of the best shots of the movie are simply of her sitting in her hotel room, curled up as if to guard herself from the world. However, she is simply not enough to save this movie from being one of the most boring I have ever seen. Watch it if you're wanting to simply sit and admire the filmmaking.

The idea of two self-loathing folks in need of companionship is not only formulaic, but bland.

But instead, these two whiners chose to get wasted in the city, party with some yuppees, and then decide they'll never see each other again. Wow. What a terrific ending.

1502497,1,B00005JMJ4,"I think that what really bothered me about this film was not whether or not it was ""exciting"" vs. ""real,"" which seems to be most of the arguments below, but the fact that the Murray-Johansson ""friendship"" didn't really bloom at all.  The only thing they had in common was being bored and lonely, he because his family (from which he is, apparently, becoming more estranged day by day) is halfway across the world from him, she because her husband is not merely (as the box describes him) a workaholic but the fact that she has practically nothing in common with him.
But herein lies a crux.  Murray and Johansson have nothing in common at all besides their loneliness.  As another reviewer put it, they ""have a mediocre time.""  The nicest scene in the entire film was when they lay in bed just talking to each other...if there had been more of that, or if it had developed from there, it might have picked up a bit.
And then there is the interesting fact that neither of them ever even mentions their new ""friend"" to their respective spouses when talking to them...as if this friendship is so clandestine that no one is supposed to know about it.  At several points in the film, I kept hoping that the pair would be accidentally walked in on by her husband just to liven things up...pretty sad (not to mention predictable), but that's how bored I became by it all.
The only halfway interesting scene was when Murray's character goes to bed with the lounge singer.  You can tell it wasn't for love but for loneliness and, more interestingly, you get the impression that it was a sort of transference of his feelings for Johansson who he really wanted but dared not touch.  That, at least, was both real and profoundly human.  But otherwise, this film is all artsy style and a glimpse of Japanese culture through the eyes of a (bored) stranger, not much more...about a 75-minute film stretched out to an hour and 45 minutes.  You will, of course, be the ultimate judge, but all I can say is, if she were me I'd want Murray's character to take me to an art museum, a symphony concert, or just sit and talk things out more than they did.  If you want a good, well-acted comedy about two strangers coming together on some common ground, get ""As Good As It Gets.""  This is a fairly dull, sad film, high on style but short on content.",1088294400,6,2327,4.490521327014218
1502498,4,B00005JMJ4,"Whenever Hollywood shows two unrelated people in mind numbing solitude, it has a tendency to connect them against all odds.  In LOST IN TRANSLATION, director Sofia Coppola tries for something daringly different.  She has 50ish film star Bob (Bill Murray) shooting a very lucrative whiskey commercial in Tokyo.  He is separated from his wife and children by far more than the nearest telephone.  In Japan, he is lost both culturally and emotionally.  Then there is a very young Charlotte (Scarlett Johannson), who has been unhappily married for two years to a photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) who seems determined to avoid her as much as Bob's wife seems determined to avoid him. Director Coppola could easily have romantically cleaved the two, the way Richard Gere did to Wynona Rider in AUTUMN IN NEW YORK. Instead, she allows them to bond in ways that show their physical and emotional needs without having to follow through on them.  When Bob carries an exhausted Charlotte into her bedroom and places her on the bed, he tucks her in with the sweet caring of a long lost father.  Given the way Coppola had presented them, I expected no less.
LOST IN TRANSLATION is not a plot driven film. It is a random walk through a neon Tokyo that is full of one dimensional stereotypes of Japanese who are eternally bowing and apologizing.  Still, this is not a flaw of the director.  To one who is truly lost in translation, a Tokyo full of babbling non-English speaking residents is exactly how that city would have seemed.  When Bob and Charlotte acknowledge their surprisingly strong ties at the film's end, the audience can see that to be alone does not mean that one has to end it or even redirect it.  Sometimes, one is satisfied with only coming to grips with it.  LOST IN TRANSLATION says this better than any other similarly intentioned film.",1088208000,3,1849,4.798107255520505

1502501,1,B00005JMJ4,"In Short: It does not measure up to all the hoopla.
If you have seen the movie and were not impressed by it, do not feel bad. There's nothing wrong with you. A lot of people around you, suffering from Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome (see the review by gregy55902), will try to make you feel stupid. You are not. You were able to see the movie for what it is: not much. If you have not seen the movie, try to see if you can find a copy in a library, like I did. The less you spend, the better you will feel.
A lot of reviews claim that those of us who didn't like it, essentially didn't get it. For those who 'got it', it was several things: real, with unique plot, idea that is like poetry, introspective genius and what not. The reality is that the movie is pretty unreal and shoddy. What has worked: cinematography, music, Bill Murray's acting. What hasn't worked: the rest.
A lot of priases of Sophia Coppola have been sung. Unfortunately, the film fails miserably in the departments she was responsible for. The two main characters are supposed to be in Tokyo just for a week. Those who have traveled to any big city in the world know that despite language problems it's hard to feel 'trapped' if you are there only for a week. If the claim is that they are feeling trapped in their current lives, then much more would have happened between them. It didn't.
About Charlotte being 'lost'. Looks like Yale's admission standards have really fallen. Their philosophy graduate is listening to popular ""You are ok. I'm ok"" type audio tape for resolving her existential doubts, does not read a single book, looks perpetually bored, instead of being excited, in a place full of culture that she has never visited before. There is no deep meaning to the the shallow development of Charlotte's character. Is it a reflection of Coppola's own life that lacks real experiences? Those close to her can answer that better. Charlotte's ""walks"" around the city with the 'lost' expression of her face seemed like a naive way of trying to link the title of the film to its content. The 'friends' of Charlotte that they spend the kareoke night with were relatively underdeveloped. And what was the point of nudie bar? All cities have them. They didn't spend much time in there anyway, so how did it help the story. The local culture has been captured only in the form of stereotypes.
The reason all the favorable reviews are asking you to go beyond this and that in order to appreciate the movie is because the lack of substance and obvious flaws in the movie. Claiming that less favorable reviews are necessarily from the people who are otherwise interested in car chases, slap-stick comedies or run-of-the-mill romances is patronizing and ignorant. The real take-home message is that this movie has been grossly overrated.
Some of the professional reviewers might have had vested interests in promoting Coppola's daughter. But the movie-goers don't owe anyone anything. There are good,well-rounded AND intriguing movies out there; this ain't one of them. But if you are looking for a movie that you want to call cool because everyone else does, this is the one for you.
In "" A conversation with director Sofia Coppola and actor Bill Murray"", there is no conversation with Coppola. The whole interview looks like ""bring your kid to work"" day for Bill Murray. Coppola has no insights to share... probably because she had none. She couldn't even think of a line for Bill Murray when he whispers in Scarlet's ear at the end of the movie. Remember ""Virgin Suicides""? This woman can't write/finish a script to save her life. Has a *LOT* to learn from her father, rather hasn't learn *anything* for her father, yet.",1088035200,24,3693,4.683076923076923
1502502,5,B00005JMJ4,"I would love to see your reactions to films such as L'Avventura by Antonioni or Two-Lane Blacktop by Monte Hellman.  Both films including Lost in Translation take a much more realist approach to the art of filmmaking; shooting on-location, using less polished/professional actors, allowing the script to be a guide and not a bible, allowing moments of silence to last uncomfortably long periods of time.  These films study not only the characters but the viewers.  You can dislike, even hate the film, for all anyone cares, especially Sofia Coppola.  But you cannot deny that it is a rare film that polarizes its audience to such extremes.  Great classic films are often called ""trash"" and ""a masterpiece"" with equal fervor.
Shockingly, the friends of mine whom I thought would hate the film absolutely loved it.  That is surprising for me.  Those same friends would probably have a hard time swallowing either of the other films I mentioned however.  It is a matter of environment, of taste and of different sensibilities.
Lost in Translation forced my complete respect and admiration for Sofia.  She not only has the sensibility of her father when it comes to direction and vision but she has borrowed a page from her heritage and made a film that reminds one of the great Italian Neorealist era in cinema from the forties to the late sixties;  introspective, while being socially interactive.  Playing off the hunger for real people from the audience, real performances, real places and situations; well, what feels like real to the audience.  It explores the character through his/her reaction to the environment and allowing dilemmas and problems to either lay unresolved or allowing the audience to resolve them.
The end scene with the whisper is a perfect example.  These two Americans stand in a street in Japan where they could most likely freely talk aloud and not be understood just as they barely understand that world.  But he whispers.  Why is that so important?  It points at you the audience and says, ""Ha!"" and it envelopes the idea of the story and the process of the film into an unpackaged whole - a kind of book where the last page is missing.  You are wholly aware of the story, the fact that it is a film, your emotions, the characters emotions but you are left to resolve it on your own.  The social interaction of the audience and the filmmaker is more important here than say a film like Castaway, where we are fully capable of sympathizing with the hanks character and we see him evolve and change and resolve his dilemmas and we are sure he will find his way even though we leave him at a crossroads in the end of the film.  He will be alright.  He will survive.  Our reaction to the characters in Lost in Translation is different.  We are left with a nagging suspicion that these two will never meet again and we will never know for sure what Bill Murray's character expressed to her.  The whisper is something that only the characters in the story share.  They will never repeat their ""adventure"" with anyone else, not even other characters in their story, so why is it a surprise that we are left out of the loop?  Because we feel involved, we feel invested and the whisper takes that involvement and holds a mirror t it.
I've gone on too long.  I just ordered this DVD and I will truly treasure it.  I hope that possibly seeing it a second time, maybe years later, for some of you will change your opinion but for now we agree to disagree because we can't have it any other way.

I cannot honestly say how much i thouroughly enjoyed this film, it truly immerses you into this mans life who has at one time been perfect, he was a huge movie star but now in his mind anyway he has almost hit rock bottom. He has gone from making feature films in the 70's to starring in a campaign add for liquor in Tokyo. Basically he is going  through a midlife crisis thousands of miles away from home. Bill Murray puts on a oscar winning performance and Scarlett Johansson lights up the screen with her supberb acting and her beautiful face and smile. This is one of those films you will either really love or really hate, i happened to think it was one of the best made and most tear inducing films i have seen in my 21 years. It is a unbeleivably well made and beautiful film, the city of tokyo is beathtaking and you truly feel that these characters are in a foreign land. It is a must see and definately a must buy, more films should take notice and see what a truly beautiful film really looks and sounds like.",1087862400,2,1207,4.180257510729613
1502600,2,B00005JMJ4,"At the time I write this review, the overall Amazon customer rating is 3 stars, based on almost 1500 reviews.  That's fairly low for an Oscar-nominated film especially one as hyped as this one was.  Expressed numerically, that's 60%, fairly dismal on the rotten-vs.-fresh meter.  Interestingly, the film scored 94% on the real meter, which is based on the reviews of professional critics.  So it's pretty clear that the general public liked the movie a lot less than the critics.  Why would this be?
It's the ""emperor's new clothes"" effect.  A bandwagon got rolling on this film and critics were scared to seem dumber than their colleagues, so they jumped on the bandwagon.  From my perspective, problems with the film included.
1. It opened with a shot of Scarlett Johansen's butt, which, though often on display in the film  (Ms. Johansen went skirtless a lot), had nothing to so with the story.  The movie wasn't about butts or sex.  Or was it?  Audiences hate ambiguity. Critics love it.
2.  The attraction between Murray and Johansen didn't work.  She was too young, beautiful, and vacant for him.  He was too old and too smart for her.  Only one thing pulled them together: the requirements of the script.  Once together, there was no onscreen chemistry.  So the relationship was unconvincing.
3.  Murray seemed more tired than lonely or disoriented.  And he was rarely funny.
4.  The ending was one of those unoriginal ride-off-in-the-sunset type things.
5.  Few people in the real world believe Sofia Coppola is that much more talented as a director than she was as an actress.
Overall, the movie was boring... except for that opening shot.",1087776000,5,1648,4.877256317689531

I didn't like it (nor did my parents) and I don't consider myself (or them) stupid. Although I am stupid for listening to the reviewers.

1502603,4,B00005JMJ4,"In my lifetime (and keep in mind, I'm only 18 years old, so it hasn't been a long lifetime), I have never seen anything like the kind of reaction Sofia Coppola's LOST IN TRANSLATION has received on its home video release. I saw this movie in the theater, and I liked it a lot, and plenty of professional film critics did too. But apparently the majority opinion of the public after this movie was released on home video has been the total opposite. Thus you have reviews like the one in the Spotlight Reviews section written by gregy55902, which, while admittedly well-written, is so disagreeable that I would be surprised if his favorite movies weren't the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy---movies about wizards and elves and dwarves that, while certainly well-made, hardly have anything to do with ""real life,"" and thus would find favor with this viewer who seemingly demands pure shallow escapism from his entertainment and can't (or is simply unwilling to) at the very least appreciate movies that try to be much more meaningful for us. If he wasn't moved by these two lonely characters and touched by their bittersweet separation at the end, then he probably just didn't want to be (since real life apparently doesn't belong to the movies, in his humble opinion---it doesn't make for exciting, mindblowing entertainment).
I'm sure he is not the only fellow who thinks this way, though, so I'll just leave it at that and call it his loss. But boy, is he wrong about the acting! What was this man expecting, Bill Murray to be consistently howling and sobbing with despair? The beauty of his performance as Bob Harris here is precisely that he refuses to overdo the feelings of despair his character must feel about his marriage, about the path his own life has taken, etc. It would certainly be the wrong acting choice, blatantly overacting in a movie that is meant to be realistic and with a character that is meant to be introspective. The great thing about Bill Murray's performance is that we always respond to Bob Harris the character, not Bill Murray the actor. (If he's improvising certain lines, he is always improvising as his character, and not injecting artificial flashes of his usual comic personality.) gregy55902, if you think it is so easy to be ""real"" in front of a camera with full knowledge that there is a camera recording your every move, then perhaps you should try film acting yourself. It is certainly NOT as easy as it looks.
I would concede that maybe the film errs in perhaps not going far enough with the Bob Harris-Charlotte relationship. There is one scene, set in a restaurant, in which Charlotte's anger at Harris after he had accidentally slept with a woman the night before is palpable, and they both say hurtful things to each other. But that gets resolved a little too quickly for my taste---although their quick making-up perhaps shows how much they truly need each other. And the shots at Japanese culture are indeed cheap and facile (I should know; I'm half-Japanese myself). Despite all that, most of what is in LOST IN TRANSLATION in its final form is so real, and touches so deeply that I am sure I could watch it again and feel the same way.
Apparently, though, this movie is not for all tastes. I would still urge any adventurous moviegoer out there to at least give this movie a shot. Try to take it for what it is---a quiet yet  uplifting comedy-drama about two lost souls in a foreign land who don't necessarily do anything extraordinarily significant together and yet separate from each other feeling a little better about themselves anyway---and maybe you'll find it as moving (if not wholly perfect) as I did.

I got the enui and sadness and loneliness of Bill Murry, living through an unhappy marriage.  He is always wry and charming in a very distinct and memorable way.
I got Scarlett Johansen's similar situation.  Her presence is very powerful and her eyes that burn holes through the screen. She has a poise and wisdom and beauty that will surely make her an enormous star.  Without the two of them the film probably would not have succeeded.
I get the strangeness of the environment, a sort of sterility and isolation inside the crowd that is all too common but that is rarely portrayed in movies.
I was impressed that..Sophia Coppola was brave enough to make a movie.. that isn't really about anything. They have no physical relationship.  It would have been an easier, more saleable film if the two of them had consumated the affair.  The restraint here allows the emotions to come to the surface, showing a maturity and depth that is very beautiful and which touches the spirit.
The minimalist style of the work is sometimes overplayed but this is certainly a worthwhile film that will be greatly enjoyed by those in the target audience.",1087516800,3,1165,4.719211822660099

1502607,5,B00005JMJ4,"A special mention here about ""Lost In
Translation,"" the Sofia Coppola film that
wowed critic Terry Teachout and others.
There are films that translate well on
television screens, but I fear this
masterpiece by the daughter of Francis
Ford Coppola of ""Godfather"" fame must
be seen on the big screen.
Few films show a semi-familiar place,
modern Tokyo, in the splash of dazzling
excitement and color this film
immortalizes.  The visuals would be
enough to hold you for an hour and forty-
five minutes.  Also, the sound track is so
ultra-modern amazing; the theatre
sound system changes from fantastical
to whimsical scene by scene.
Scarlett Johansson, a pretty young
blonde plays the thoughtful and lonely
wife of an inattentive photographer on
an assignment in Japan.  Bill Murray of
comedic movies like ""Ground Hog Day""
or ""Caddie Shack"" plays a semi-serious
role, a washed up TV star doing whiskey
commercials for Japanese television.
Unfortunately, Murray is going through a
mid-life crisis and is lonely like
Johansson.  Sure, they connect, but this
is not the love story you might expect.
We want them to be lovers, but even for
the audience there are ethical
considerations.  How many movies
involve the viewers with such subtlety?  I

Scarlett Johansson is the young pretty thing living in Japan with her new husband who happens to be too busy to pay her much attention. So she is bored and lonely. Gee, I wonder what happens?
I was bored watching this movie it felt a little too close to a day spent pacing the floor for something to do. Two people floundering around in Japan exposing themselves to situations that mean absolutely nothing. A great love story? NO! A surprise? NO! How many times do bad relationships start out exactly like the two characters in this movie? ALWAYS!

And the audience gets a peak of what it's like to be a stranger in a strange land where a lot gets lost in translation.  Having been to Japan myself, it reminded me of the feelings of not quite being able to communicate.  And the funny mistakes that are inevitable when cultures and languages are so different.

Starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson as the two lost souls, their performances are nothing less than brilliant.  I laughed out loud at times.  And at other times I was moved by each of their predicaments with their marriages and their search for meaning in their lives.  Always, I was delighted with the film. There's a feeling of freshness throughout, as if the characters were just opening their eyes for the first time.  It was well paced and the cinematography captured the reality of modern Japan.

The DVD had some unexpected extras too - most notably a half-hour documentary about the making of the film.  It followed the film crew from Day One and I loved being steeped in all that behind-the-scenes film lore.  Sophia Coppola was the writer and director.  She won an academy award for the best screenplay written directly for the screen.  I can certainly understand why, especially as I came to understand the challenges of filming in Tokyo.

I though first overrated because what's the deal about this friendship (Scarlett and Bill's), what's so great about it? It's because it's not really about a great friendship and all that. It's about just friendship and how great it is to find it when you're LOST and ALONE. That's why it's deeper than anything else this year; it's not about LUST or LOVE. It's just the fact a friendship can work w/o really anything in common with these people. That's why in the trailer it says FRIENDSHIP needs no TRANSLATION. Hence, Lost In Translation.
The soundtrack is great and PERFECT. Superbly acted too by Murray and Johansson. The ending will shatter your heart, too.

After being a gaijin in tokyo, so much of this movie became clear--especially the reason for so much melodrama. Spend at least a week in Tokyo by yourself with minimal japanese, and you will understand everything. You really feel the hollowness that was portrayed.
My favorite scene has become Murray on the escalator at the JR station during rush hour...you're standing with a few thousand people and you're completely alone, in relative quiet (no one talks).
The desolate emptiness shown by the characters...it's real after a few days in Tokyo. I love Tokyo, but it can be very...strange.
This movie does a great job of using the unsettling effect of Tokyo exposure  to intensify the characters' personal conflicts.

1502823,5,B00005JMJ4,"It was nice to see this movie. There we are, in Tokio with Bill Murray... This guy is one of the few good actors in Hollywood, a pit he has been so underestimated all these years! He has this thing that you just look and get engaged, what is essential for his role in this movie.
I think people is so used to watch ""easy-to-see expect-an-unintelligent-audience soap-opera cheesy-and-popcorn good-guy-gets-good-girl"" sort of movies, that they get a bit confused with this one. And it's not a matter of watching this movie with an open mind... just sit, eat your popcorn (this isn't any problem), and try to think 2 minutes after watching it... (no, it isn't necessary make a long reflection)... Actually, you can skip thinking 2 minutes too...
The very thing that I loved in this movie is that what everybody is expecting to happen at any time (sooner or later... probably later, in the end, as usual...) never happens...
I hope I'm not spoiling things here... But the story is very simple... nice guy (Bill Murray) meets a nice girl whose husband lets her too much time alone... Besides, the nice guy is far from home and isn't getting nice conversations with his wife in the phone...
Well, what does everybody expect to happen here? I'm not even say...
The real spoiler might be that... it doesn't happen!
And that's great that it doesn't happen... Seeing the trailer one can understand what this movie is really about...
The guys don't speak japanese and need translators.. but they suddenly share something that doesn't need translation, which is friendship! And that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Just friendship.
For people that think that they understand immediately the point of other people... I would say at this point.. You are wrong...
No I'm not saying that just because this movie breaks with a cliche this automatically makes it better than the others. I'm not even saying that it's better than anything. I'm just saying this is a good movie, I enjoyed it, I hope you enjoy too, and you get an enriching experience as I did. What's nice in the movie is the interaction among the characters and how people simply can't avoid feeling unhappy just because they're passing some time bored or a bit lonely, and don't have a nice way to kill time or some nice company...
The point here is: Bill Murray is married and have some children! He's passing for some kind of personal crisis, and his relationship is not wonderful, but it's no reason for him to get a divorce and begin another relationship, just because he's going  out with a nice young girl (that probably would turn out to be like his wife after some time engaged in a relationship with him...)
Let us face the facts, no relationship is perfect and wonderful all the time. The truth is that one wouldn't be necessarily more happy just switching partners every time things are not so good and one meets another ""nice"" one... Of course, I'm not saying that one wouldn't want, if possible... Well... I hope you get my meaning here...
The girl in the movie is just bored!
She's not enjoying things, she doesn't like japanese tv, doesn't feel anything in a japanese church, doesn't comprehend (nor wants to understand) japanese culture, etc.. And his husband is leaving her too much time alone... That's her problem... She simply can't avoid the feeling that she's not as happy as she wanted to be... Besides, she's not even considering the hypothesis that she might be passing for a rich moment in her life.
However, it doesn't mean that get involved with Bill Murray would make her life better, or make her more talented (other thing that she complains, that she's not very talented for her work...).

The music by Kevin Shields was nice and so was Tokyo. The rest of the film (story, characters and cal) tried desperately to appear deep and dimensional, but it just didn't work. Maybe it was because the film was from Hollywood and I thought the colours were just too rich in contrast to the slow, boring mood in the film. Somehow i got the impression that the Coppola wanted to achieve those moods and... a story about people being meaninglessly stupid and fearing their own loneliness (although they brought it upon themselves).

1502826,5,B00005JMJ4,"Prior to watching this film, some understandings of the Japanese culture is highly recommended.
In the Japanese language, there's no pronunciation to distinguish between the ""L"" and ""R"" sounds. They do not roll their tongue when speaking so the ""L"" and ""R"" sounds come out to be the same. The Japanese term for ""to cover"" can also mean ""to close"" when translated literally.
The most common S&M fantasy in the Japanese adult video involves a woman role-playing as a victim who is continuously struggling, moaning, and yelling out ""stop!"" as the man removes her clothes.
A Japanese talk show with a whacky and goofy looking host is called a ""variety show"". It's a type of unstructured, anything-goes TV program that usually offers various contents geared toward viewers of all ages.
In Japan, people often tie folded notes to a ""wish-making tree"". It's the Japanese version of a wish fountain.
Hot-Pot is a popular way of Asian dining (especially during winter season) where customers cook their own food in a boiling pot and then dip it in sauce that's mixed accordingly to their own taste. The benefit of cooking your own food in a restaurant is that there's no clean-up afterwards.
""Lost in Translation is by all accounts a huge film. Telling of a 50-something married man and a 20ish married woman - both Americans stuck in a hotel in Tokyo with too much time on their hands - who come together to soothe the yearning they both have for companionship. It is a sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human. Masterfully struck from little more than nuances with slick art and technicals, this Coppola coup will tell you more about who you are than about the two principals.

1502828,4,B00005JMJ4,"The movie has no over-powering theme.  I believe the viewers who gave it bad ratings were put off by this.  It is seriously like watching an excerpt from the daily life of two people.  But it does so in a way that reveals some things about our own nature as people.
A successful older man and a married-too-soon younger woman meet in Tokyo.  Both are at odds with the culture there, but find eachother and spark up a very interesting friendship.  They share common interests but are from two totally different generations. The man is going through his mid-life crisis and the girl is just lost and confused in Tokyo.  They find a common ground on their cynicism and have a wonderful time together.  This is not the meaningful part of the story however.
The great thing about the movie is in observing the subtle sub plots of the movie and observing their behavior.  This is definitely an ""intellectual"" film if you want to call it that because it plays on how your philosophy and perception.  That is its draw.  If you're expecting a thriller or drama or love story, this isn't it.  But if you're looking for a movie that is very well acted and very well written and makes for a thought provoking view, watch Lost in Translation.",1086393600,10,1229,4.540909090909091
1502829,5,B00005JMJ4,"This beautiful masterpiece of understatement, and hope has left an immense impression on me. Vividly honest and fresh with a genuine sentimentality, Sofia Coppola weaves the lives of Murray and Johannsen together in an unforgettable and compelling tale of loneliness, love, and commitment. Two star-crossed lovers, islanded by their strength of character that keeps them apart, nevertheless find a happiness with each other that validates and gives meaning to their world-weary lives.
If you anticipate certain roles to be fulfilled and plot devices to be executed in the movies you watch, do not buy this DVD. It is a crisp and soothing breath of fresh air that effortlessly smashes the boundaries of Hollywood romantic comedies, not to be appreciated by those with overarching optimistic sentimentalities and expectations of their movie-going experiences",1086307200,7,856,5.541984732824427

The result is disturbing. The first link I found is the huge influence of Michelangelo Antonioni (The eclipse)and Jim Jarmush (Mistery train), the script begins as a promise, and many expectatives; so in the middle of the film it happens nothing; the film falls in a hole: There isn't any brief clue about these strangers in the middle of Tokio; the loneliness and the no sense life is a issue so many times told. But I still hope for a twist in the script; the boring of Murray fills the half of the movie; ok, that{s the point, so what are you going to do? . Scarlett Johanson is the most remarkable point to review, a new promise talented actress so as the homagge to La dolce Vita of Federico Fellini ; remember that in Under the sun of Toscana there's another homagge to the same Fellini's work.
So the film remains between the hopeless, the memories and the huge crowd, the video games that mesmerizes to the young people against the adult clubs.

1502924,4,B00005JMJ4,"Although I do not normally watch movies like these -- overhyped ones, that is -- I rented this film and was surprised that I made it all the way through it.  The best thing about this film is Bill Murray.  He is one of the most underrated actors out there today and the fact that he didn't get the Oscar for his performance just shows how effortless he made his performance look.  I thought he was funny and poignant and I'm not sure this film could have worked without him.  The other character -- the young woman -- was also very good, very lost on her own, trying to find her place in a flailing marriage as she learns that the man she married suddenly isn't there anymore, that he's become some sort of poseur while working with the subjects of his shoots.
Now with all that being said, this is not a film for everyone.  Fans of action films, fans of films with a standard story arc will not enjoy this film because basically nothing happens.  There is no great crisis, no huge drama, not pivotal moment in the story where the viewers can say, ""Oh, okay...now let's see where it goes from here.""  The story meanders along, lost, like the characters in the film.  At 1 hour and 45 minutes, it was a little long and despite the humor in the karaoke scene, I think that scene should have been cut out -- why Sofia Coppola lingered so long on that part of the story is beyond me.  Maybe she needed to make it a certain length for distribution?  Aside from that portion which nearly lost my attention, the film was very good and well worth watching if you're a fan of Bill Murray and character studies.  The look on Bill's face when he wakes up after a night with the jazz singer is worth the price of the rental alone.
Overall, a good film, but definitely not for everyone!!  Certainly not worth the Best Film Oscar nod, but still pretty good.",1086048000,4,1843,4.325581395348837

There wasn't a plot and it reminds me of those types of movies that those people who were just hurt in a relationship want to make to express their undying sadness and make their ex's seem like total uncaring arschlocher. I also don't understand why every premis to a movie or story has to be based on love. It's not a very intersting subject, and it's not that I can't relate, I just find it a boring subject.

I think I get the whole title thing, I really do.  I mean it's based on the director's experience - about feeling lost in a totally foreign culture.  There were flashes of greatness (Bill Murray's wife Fed-Exing decorating decisions, the whole has-been actor scenes, etc.) and the feeling of isolation was beautifully done (the young wife feeling alone even when with her husband, phone conversations were compelling, and so on) but it's just like that story you and your friends tell and laugh hysterically about but either you REALLY had to be there to find it funny or you have to be ______(drunk, sleep deprived or you fill in the blank here) to understand.  I mean, these are things you only retell in certain personal circles so what made the director think a general audience would appreciate this piece of work?  Maybe it's pure genuis and just like her characters who don't ""get"" what's going on around them - the viewer isn't meant to like it either.  In that case, this film is too student-art-house for me and even if it is as brillant as most declare.......put me down for an emphatic ""NO"".  Sophie Coppola scored high with me for her previous film ""Virgin Suicides"" but maybe that was because her style of deliberate unclarity fit that particular story which was based on a great novel by the same name.

1502928,1,B00005JMJ4,"I saw this movie on a whim because it was playing on my college campus and the ticket was two bucks. When it was over, I started thinking about what I could have done with that two hours instead of watch this crap.
Shockingly, I've encountered many people who thought that this movie was ""brilliant,"" and that if I didn't like it that I just ""didn't understand it."" What's to understand? This movie has no plot, the humor is weak...it's basically as bad as a student art film.
I've since come to realize that this movie suffers from the Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome (ENCS). In the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, a vain emperor employs two con artists to tailor a new set of clothes for him. According to the con men, the clothing is so fine that it can only be seen by those of high intelligence. So the con men start weaving nothing, and everyone who goes to examine the ""clothing"" pretends that they can see it simply because they don't want people to think that they are too dumb to see it. The emperor goes so far as to ""wearing"" the ""clothes"" (so basically he's naked) because he's afraid that people will think he is dumb if he admits that he cannot see the fibers.
This movie reminded me of that. It's a film with a meandering plot and terrible characters disguised as a ""brilliant, intellectual film."" I think most of the people who thought it was brilliant are simply too pompous to admit that the movie was garbage. Instead, they like to think that they are intelligent enough to understand the ""hidden meanings."" What hidden meanings?
A movie's principal purpose should be to entertain. Everything else comes second. So what if this film is considered to have hidden meanings and symbolism? It failed to entertain me, so in essence it failed as a film.",1085875200,24,1770,4.551724137931035

I don't really fall in line with the ""imagine a perfect ending"" idea, my take with the abrupt ending is that, life keeps on going. Their stories aren't over. It wouldn't be real (yes, i'm saying ""real"" *gasp* movies? real? what?) if there was some slam-bang finale because that's not what life is about.
You said that movies are about compelling images and brilliant characters. Movies, Theatre, Music, everything is about life. This movies is about life. And sometimes life is boring. Sometimes people are lackluster and boring. The movie's not about being openly brilliant and spectacular. It's about the subleties.
As for actors being real. Acting...no matter what character you portray, you'll always be showing some facet of yourself. It's actually pretty hard to be ""real"", which no...gloss and performance. Some people don't realize it. On the topic of these actors being real, I don't think Scarlett J. did a fantastic job of it. She was good, but Bill Murray was better.

1503024,4,B00005JMJ4,"First of all, this is certainly not a movie for everyone.  It is dreamlike, hypnotic, atmospheric and quiet and makes no pretense to being some great statement or telling some great parable.  It is impressionistic, and meant to be something you slide in to, not something that beats you over the head.  That being said, I do also feel like some people were disappointed in it because they expected either:
1. A ""Bill Murray"" movie (i.e. Groundhog Day, Scrooged)
2. A ""Romantic Comedy"" (i.e. most Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movies)
It is neither.
Looking back on the movie, I think the most telling sign of where it was going was the inclusion of many Kevin Shields/My Bloody Valentine tracks during the film.  MBV (a group that people also loved or hated) worked on the idea that all of the instruments, voices included, were equally important and shouldn't necessarily stand out in the mix.  This seems to be the idea behind Lost In Translation, where the setting, the actors, the characters, and the plot are all equally important (or unimportant) and not meant to take precedence.  What you're left with, if you connect with it, is a memory of a couple specific moments (notably the karaoke scene and the crazy Japanese talk show, which are two true ""set pieces"" of any length), and more a mood that ""Lost"" has set and a chance to wonder what these people actually found, because it's clear they never figured that out completely.  It is romantic, but not a cut-and-dry romance like most formualic ""romantic"" movies.  It's not a perfect movie (it does have even slower spots in an already slow film), and I might have liked to have a commentary track, although the bonus interview shows Sofia Coppola to be less than magnetic and interesting.

Both of them going thru the same spell of loneliness & helplessness find comfort in each other's company that develops in an unlikely bond.
Two Americans stint with tokyo lifestyle is very amusing to watch. For those who are not familiar with Tokyo lifestyle like me , here is a good chance to go through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, nightlife, etc..
The movie is a collection of very fine moments between the two, but the finest moment comes at the end when Murray is leaving Tokyo,both realize that there is no way they could ever maintain a relationship with each other, his final statement to her is whispered into her ear and we cannot know what it was he said.

Second, she gives an example of detachment and the acute introspection that can result.  Bill Murray knows that much of what is being translated for him from Japanese is ""lost,"" thus resulting in truncated and unsatisfactory communication -- in fact, the absence of communication.  But it is not just the Japanese that alludes him. His interaction, even the long distance calls home, are misunderstood, taken out of context, void of meaning.  The central characters of this film find themselves in Japan and are forced to re-invent or perhaps re-discover themselves.  That is what this film is conveying.  Anyone who has travelled extensively, and faced the long nights away from home will recognize the way the mind works in such instances, will know that there are times when one is uncertain of understanding oneself, let alone the foreign tongues on all sides of you.  This film is a work of stark originality.

Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson meet at the right place and time. They give one another something that the other needs.  They communicate when the rest of the world appears to be concerned with superficial stuff like carpet squares and diets.
""Lost in Translation""  does not mean ""Oh too bad they cannot speak the language!""  It means...that many of us are not listening anyhow, even in the same language.
Bill and Scarlett are 30 years apart, but are both filling a void in one another, they are listening to one another.
The sexiest scene is when her toe touches his toe!
Ohhhh yea, baby!

nothing happens!!!!!

It's interesting, because my wife always wants me to create conversation, or make her laugh. But in watching this movie, she states that the actors didn't need to say anything, which they didn't, because they understood each other perfectly. Well, that's nice for them, but it's really terrible for us who have to watch them doing, well, almost absolutly nothing. I mean, there is a reason my wife likes me talk. Just sitting there looking at each other can get frustrating after awhile, even though my wife is beautiful to look at.
  There were times that I was just so annoyed, because I would sit through various scenes just waiting, begging, pleading for Bill Murry and Scarlett Johansson to say something meaningful to each other. And what was I rewarded with for my patience? Zero. I mean they said something, but what exactly was said, was not worth all that waiting. I just couldn't believe that someone would direct a movie this way on purpoes. Maybe as an art project, but certainly not as something meant to entertain us.
 To be fair, they did actually have one decent conversation with each other while laying in bed, but even then, Bill Murray was half asleep while they had it. But I can't blame him for sleeping through that dialog; sleep was starting to over take me too.

Therefore, it creates an interesting enigma.  How can one film produce such admiration in some and disdain in most?  The answer lies in its nontraditional storytelling.  Writer/director Sophia Coppola decided to abandon powerful drama, instead opting for a film that focuses primarily on character development.  As far as story goes, the film really lacks a large plot-arc with any kind of driving conflict.  Each scene is enjoyable as little vignettes, but most viewers will search for (and not find) something larger to keep their attention.  The end result is a film with an almost ""Reality-Tv"" feel.  It is if a camera crew followed two people around Japan, just to document their lives.

I rarely trust the ""critics"" but rarely doesn't mean never.
  Well, I would have to think and think hard at that, to remember another film which was so hyped and amounted to so much nothingness. Adding more to the mystery is that this thing even won awards.
  To keep things short, this is a surreally uninspired script, which employs 2 otherwise very good actors who in turn spend two hours delivering some of the most boring lines i've heard in a long time on film. Supposedly this is an intellectual comedy (now THAT's a joke) but in that case the joke must be on the audience. I found myself grinning a coupla times and basically that was it. Cheap jokes about how the Japanese mispronounce English isn't exactly what i deem ""intellectual"" for one thing, and for another, tired semi-pick up lines over whiskey doesn't cut it for ""humour"" as far as I'm concerned either..
  And all this despite being positively biased because i happen to be a big fan of Murray's..
  ""Lost in Translation"" attempts to take a quirky look at two people ""trapped"" in a mega-lux hotel in Tokyo who while seeing their marriages falling apart are also seeing their lives becoming epmtier and emptier and devoid of ""meaning"". What they do about that is wander about hopelessly, meet in the hotel bar, down some drinks and then some more, wander again, meet in the hotel bar and toos back some more drinks and have some seriously empty conversations in the process.
  Uhm, is this supposed to be ""deep"" or something and if yes in exactly what kind of circles does this pass as deep? Or is it supposed to be ""touching"" as some other people claimed? Touching? Christ, if all flirting was THAT boring there'd eventually be a law against it.
  There was also this other line of argument from people who said that this film is good because of the stark contrast it provides to most of the mindless Hollywood films out there. Ok, I'd be willing to entertain such a noble notion, but this would mean that this film is not mindless. Which it's not, but just because a film raises the IQ bar a mere few points over the general mediocrity it doesn't mean that it automatically becomes intelligent. Lost in Translation wants to be intelligent but it can't. There's no adequate story for the film to ""stand"" onto and there's no clear premise that this joke of a script has.
  I was watching J.Murray in this film thinking that he actually performs good in it because he perfectly reflects the atmosphere of the film: boredom beyond salvage. Yes, he outdoes the audience being bored, but he had an easier job than us. We didn't have to wait hours on set just to say pseudo-intellectual script-lines. If any other actor had been in his place he'd be forced to perform just as good because ""Lost in Translation would give him no other choice but look and act bored to utter tears.
  Now, more generally speaking, why would i care about some woman (to whom we are given no depth at all) who's  bored because her photographer husband is running about on business leaving her all alone in this lux hotel. I mean, the poor thing!!!! How humdrum!!! Or a millionaire actor with a midlife crisis who's about to cash in a cool two-mill for spending a week in this hotel? I'd take the boredom for that and i wouldn't even expect any mercy from the ones around me if you know what i mean. How could you possibly identify with such paper-thin characters? Totally beyond me...
  Lost in Translation will sadly enter way high on the list for one of the most overhyped films in recent memory. And immediately after that it will also proudly enter the list as one of the most mediocre films to win awards in recent time.

It's the basic 'fish out of water' story minus any comedy or social commentary or character devlopment or anything else common to similar themed films.

This is NOT an artistic film either. The neon colored street-scapes of Tokyo would look just as impressive if this was a porno.

I never watch television or go to the movies, so i never really saw a trailer for this film. I did not even know what it was about. I just went into the film with no expectations and no idea about what i was about to watch.
And you know what? It was pretty darn good. The acting in this movie is amazing...you never feel like you're watching something scripted. Everything comes off as being very, very natural. Coppola does a superb job of conveying emotion through scenery. You find yourself being a content observer...happy to stroll through the streets and buildings of Tokyo and VERY HAPPY to watch the karaoke sequence (youll know what im talking about).
As for the plot, story, etc...you'll often think ""huh, nothing is going on""...but that is the beauty of this film. Nothing seems to happen and everything seems to happen. You walk away from this film feeling full, even though you never felt like you had been sitting through a movie.
I rented it...but now im going to buy it. Definitely one of the better movies ive seen in a long, long time.",1084838400,,1184,4.61611374407583
1503121,5,B00005JMJ4,"With Lost In Translation, Sofia Coppola has definitively proven that her film Virgin Suicides was no fluke. She is a profoundly gifted film maker. Both films move at a different pace from much of what passes for cinema these days. Nothing explodes; the lead actors don't hop into bed;  and there are no hyper dramatic scenes. Instead, each film unfolds at its own pace.
Yet there is nothing boring or stagnant in Lost In Translation. There is an easy naturalism to the plot line and the performances.  Of course, achieving this almost serene passage through the story is kind of like a perfect swing of a bat. What appears as effortless is the end result of focus, inspiration and lots of hard work.
As I get older ( I'm pushing 50 ). I find that I am constantly amazed by the great poise and skill that so many young actors bring to their work. Scarlett Johanssen is one of these people. My, God, she's a baby! Where does this depth and richness of portrayal come from? When I was her age the two big issues in my life were praying not to end up in Vietnam and seeing to it that my parents didn't know about my partying. When Johanssen is on screen she is mesmerizing, even when she is doing nothing.
But what makes this film a cause for celebration to my mind is Bill Murray. I'd pay money to watch him mow his lawn. He has a comic ( or maybe bemused is a better term ) approach to the world that can't be taught in drama school. He is a wonderfully unique actor whose particular skills where used to perfection in this film. His understated but hilarious reactions to Japanese culture are a treat to behold. Murray, like Johannsen, seemingly doesn't have to break a sweat in order to delivery fantastic performances. This film might have been much less successfully absent it's magnificent casting and Coppola's subtle mastery.
The plot is almost secondary to the story, because it is the intricate , unique and beautiful relationship that develops between Murray and Johanssen that drives this tale. This is a very special film. It is masterfully framed and filmed. The subtle color palette employed by the cinematography is visually lovely and  lyrically incorporates itself into the specific feel of the story as well as its.physical environment. Coppola has truly distinguished herself and has left me very much looking forward to her next project.",1084752000,10,2355,4.669879518072289
1503122,5,B00005JMJ4,"I found this movie to deserve most of the critical hype it's received. This is unusual; critical raves usually leave me cold. Perhaps the finest touch in Coppola's screenplay and direction is that her characters don't emote at each other. I think a lot of viewers here are put off by that; for my part, I found her dialogue and her characters' reactions to various things going on in their lives to be absolutely accurate. Reactions, expressions and the gradual warming to each other of the two unlikely main characters are completely plausible (unlike, for example, the revolting characters in The Hours, another critical fave). If you're looking for excitement, this is not the place to go.
Bill Murray's character is a man who clearly enjoyed earlier parts of his life but is gripped by tremendous late-middle-age ennui. The source of this appears to be his marriage, to a wife whom he once loved but whom he now apparently and somewhat harshly sees as a materialistic scrub. He does not have a lot of juice left. Scarlett's character is nothing BUT juice; her problem is twofold. First, her husband doesn't pay enough attention to her. Second, she does not play ball with her husband's business contacts, which is not a particularly good practice and results in her spending a lot of miserable days in a sterile Japanese hotel room. The bulk of the movie consists of these two flawed characters' efforts to work around their respective mismatched relationships to find something truer and finer, while locked in the surreal environment of the Tokyo Ginza.
Perhaps the finest moment comes at the end, when Murray realizes that there is no way he could ever maintain a relationship with this girl, but also appreciates the way in which she gave him a spark of energy that he thought he had lost forever. Again, no hysterics or melodrama; his final statement to her is whispered into her ear and you cannot know what it was he said unless you're practiced as a lip-reader. A very good touch to conclude this film which never insults the viewers' intelligence.",1084752000,5,2060,4.822033898305085
1503123,3,B00005JMJ4,"No doubt, this movie is the defining accomplishment of Bill Murrary's long career.  Scarlet Johansson gives another fantastic performance (as in ""Girl with the Pearl Earing"").  What's more, their chemistry on screen is the best I've seen this year.  Certainly these are some of the tasty ingredients needed to cook up a great film, but as Sophia Coppola will learn in what figures to be a long and decorated directing career, you need something more.  At times while watching ""Lost in Translation"", I felt just that - lost. The relationship between Scarlett's character (the exact name eludes me) and her husband is not given enough time on screen for the audience to find out exactly why she is so unhappy with him, especially if her discontent is such that she is willing to persue a relationship with someone twice her age.  This is my main problem with the film among others, but I did rate the movie a three which, in my book, means it was good, not great, and not quite worthy of an Oscar (sorry Miss Copola). Like I said, the chemistry is definatley there, and that in itself makes the movie quite an enjoyable experience. Although this film fails to really get off the ground in terms of the plot (or lack thereof) and leaves much to be desired , it succeeds in capturing the beautiful simplicity of needing someone - if only for a single, vulnerable moment.",1084752000,2,1366,4.651452282157677
1503124,2,B00005JMJ4,"I came away from this movie feeling very underwhelmed.  Far from being the tour-de-force that many critics made it out to be, ""Lost in Translation"" was, in my view, a pastiche of sappy cliches, banal dialogue, and unfunny attempts at humor.  Although there was a certain degree of tenderness and poignancy in the relationship between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, that could not conceal the fact that something important and quintessential in their relationship was missing, rendering it less than convincing.
To be fair, the film started out well.  As the two protagonists exchanged pleasantries late one night over drinks, their budding friendship seemed genuine and entirely believable.  But, alas, that quality faded as their romance further evolved.  Murray appeared increasingly wooden and lethargic, while Johanssen became annoyingly predictable, smiling and chuckling as if on cue.  In the penultimate scene, when the two were locked in a farewell embrace, their feelings for each other seemed artificial and, in a sense, unfounded.  Small wonder, then, that I was left with the inescapable impression that I had fallen victim to a beguiling swindle.",1084752000,3,1164,5.397790055248619
1503125,5,B00005JMJ4,"What are masterpieces and why are there so few of them?
Maybe it's because American filmmakers have lost all semblance of subtlety.  If it doesn't have explicit sex, explosions, dogmatic moralizing messages, or a plot that leaves nothing to the imagination it isn't accepted as a ""good"" movie these days.
Lost in Translation is a subtle movie, and an emotional one.  I've never felt so satisfied with my experience watching a movie as I did after I left the theatre.  Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are excellent, and their relationship develops beautifully throughout the film.
Coppala had done a great job of creating a film that doesn't follow the traditional Hollywood requirements for a ""good"" movie and instead has given us a masterpiece.  She treats Tokyo with a great deal of care, the city itself becomes one of the characters in the movie as Johansson and Murray find themselves lost (and not happily touring) the place.
Truly excellent, and in my top 5 movies list.",1084752000,3,980,4.921212121212121
1503126,5,B00005JMJ4,"After watching ""Lost in Translation"" the thought that most stuck out in my mind was that this was Sofia Coppola's film.  A lot of the talk about the film before the Oscars was about Bill Murray's performance, especially after he won the Golden Globe, but I did not think it was his best work.  I would still insist that it was ""Groundhog Day"" where he displayed the greatest range and had his most heartfelt moments (i.e., the last night with Rita).  As for Scarlett Johansson, ""Lost in Translation"" was not even her best performance of 2003.  That would be her role as Griet in ""Girl with a Pearl Earring.""  This is not to say that the performances by Murray and Johansson in this film are not excellent, but simply that both have done better.
However, I do not think you can say the same for Coppola, since ""Lost in Translation"" is the second major film she has written and directed, the first being 1999's ""The Virgin Suicide.""  The key difference is that this time Coppola is doing an original story and not an adaptation.  The story is about two lost souls who meet in a Tokyo hotel and spend the night together, but not in the convention meaning of the phrase.  Murray is Bob Harris, a movie star who has come to Japan to make a series of commercials for Suntory whiskey for big bucks, and while this keeps him far away from his wife and kids his phone calls home suggest his marriage is as much an obligation as this gig.  Johansson is Charlotte, who has been dragged by her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi) on an assignment and is left to entertain herself while he is running around taking photographs of some minor Hollywood starlet (Anna Faris), and perhaps doing more.
Our expectation is that Bob and Charlotte are going to end up in bed together, but Copolla is playing with our expectations.  After all, two people can cling to each other through psychological intimacy as well as the physical.  These two people are also in the middle of a neon colored alien environment with the late night Tokyo of karaoke bars and pachinko parlors.  The dark hotel bar becomes a sort of womb that these two characters have reentered and are going to emerge from at the end of the film changed in some way that Coppola, in a masterstroke, decides not to share with the audience.  Bob and Charlotte have their own lessons learned from this experience and Coppola leaves it to the audience you draw their own conclusions.
""Lost in Translation"" is a meditation, and for those who have not been married or who have never been a stranger in a strange land the realities of this fictional tale may well be lost.  One of the reasons it stand out so prominently compared to the other films nominated for Best Picture Oscars in 2003 is that it is an intimate film while the others were either spectacles (""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" and ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"") or larger than life stories (""Mystic River"" and ""Seabiscuit"").  But even an intimate mediation can be a jewel of a film.",1084752000,6,3031,4.556169429097606

Well, how two strangers meet each other in Tokyo and they are bored together. Great. Where's the twist? Where's the actual plot? There is none. They just drag themselves around bars and parties being bored out of their minds.
One thing I really do NOT understand, is why the majority went crazy over this movie and believed it to be a masterpice. I personally, do not find it interesting to watch a middle aged man being followed by a camera in Tokyo, and him being bored the whole time. Where is the satisfaction?

1503195,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola's latest work, is without question one of the finer films of the year. The stylistic transition from her last feature, The Virgin Suicides, to Lost in Translation is not exactly obvious, but nonetheless shows Coppola directing a more mature-natured picture than she previously has. Lost in Translation's subtleties are its greatest achievements, while the actor's performances are the impressive allies to a compelling story of love, life, chemistry, and respect. If at least one Oscar is not garnered from this combination of elements, I will find myself sadly disappointed.
The movie begins with Bob Harris (Bill Murray) arriving in Tokyo, Japan to shoot a commercial for a Japanese-brand whisky. Upon arriving in the country, it's immediately obvious that he is not completely up for this task. He arrives at a beautiful hotel where he is lavishly welcomed by the hotel's staff before retreating to his room to alienate himself from the experience. Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson, is also at the hotel. She is staying with her photographer husband while his is in the country for work.
The next evening, Charlotte sees Bob having a less than fulfilling time in the hotel's lounge and sends him a drink. Later that evening, they meet again in the lounge when both are unable to sleep. An instant bond is established and the two slowly begin to realize that they are the best suited company for one another.
Eventually Bob and Charlotte go out together on the town. In the midst of being in a completely different culture, where more than the language is a barrier, the two find themselves meeting on a much deeper level than they had originally planned. The fact that the age difference is obvious to the audience makes some of the subsequent scenes more intense. You're left to question if the two are going to take the relationship to a sexual level. You're left to question if the two are truly falling in love. You're left to question if the age really has any bearing on the chemistry that they feel together.
Therein lays the true beauty of this film. Although it would be extremely easy to have these two romantically fall in love, they're simply two people that meet on an emotional level. For lack of better words, they just understand each other. For the next couple of days they utilize their time to the fullest by enjoying their time together. They don't want the time to end, but realize that in just a few short days everything in their lives will go back to normal.
During the last evening of the trip, a fire alarm is sounded in the hotel forcing everyone outside until all is clear. At this point, Bob sees Charlotte and approaches her. The moment is uncomfortable because, through no intention of his own, Charlotte becomes aware of the fact that Bob has unexpectedly had another woman in his room the night before. Unable to deny the fact that she has become emotionally attached, Charlotte asks Bob when he is going home. He replies, ""In the morning."" At this point, it's in the open and the two realize just exactly how much fun they've had together over the course of their visit to Japan. This is a friendship that could very easily be taken to the next level, but somehow the two are smart enough to understand that this is something that just needs remain where it's at.
After leaving the hotel to catch his plane home, Bob sees Charlotte walking down the streets of Tokyo and implores the driver to pull over so he can say what he wanted to say earlier. Unfortunately, and fortunately, we are unable to hear what he tells Charlotte. We're only left to speculate what it is. I'm sure most people agree that it can only be one or two things. It's such a beautiful scene, though. It's one of the true highlights of cinema in the past several years.
Everything about Lost in Translation is in the right place. As I stated before, it's the subtleties that make it so great. Whether it's the witty humor of Murray, the innocence of Johansson, the brief appearances of the small handful of cast members, or the beautiful imagery of Tokyo, nothing has been overdone.
Finally, as I left the theatre, I realized just exactly how much my emotions had been played with. However, it wasn't until the second time I saw this film that I fully understood why. On some level I guess I had wanted things to turn out differently, but maturity of the writing actually made this movie ten times more enjoyable than it would have been had it ended the way I wanted it to the first time.",1084406400,8,4537,4.68671679197995
1503196,2,B00005JMJ4,"I didn't really dislike this movie per se.  I think that it's strengths lie in its cinematography and art direction.  Also, I found the dialogue to be subtle, understated, nuanced, and compelling.
Other than that, the movie did not really impress me.  First off, this film falls into the genre of ""Emo-type Americans who travel to a non-English speaking country and try to `find themselves.'""  What usually happens is that world-weary protagonists travel to foreign countries where they are unable to communicate with the native population because they are not able to speak the language of the country they are visiting (in this case Japanese).  Thus, the native population comes off as mysterious and inscrutable, their customs strange and exotic, and their culture beautiful but ultimately unknowable.  This irreconcilable gulf between the protagonists and the native population helps to highlight and symbolize the alienation and isolation that the protagonist feels toward the rest of humanity.  It also leads to many humorous scenes when the protagonists are arbitrarily thrown into disorienting and/or stereotype-reinforcing situations, such as a protagonist finding himself taller than the rest of the Asian men in an elevator, or a protagonist being beset by an E.S.L. prostitute who no doubt caters to all sort of deviant sexual fantasies for the native men, fantasies that the foreign protagonist cannot begin to fathom.  The movie is beautifully shot, full of soul, and the dialogue and interactions between characters ring true to life.  The problem is that the movie falls into this whole obnoxious genre of a stranger in a strange land.  It is the film's only flaw, but it is fatal to the integrity of the movie.
Both Murray and Johansson burn brightly in their respective roles.  Giovanni Ribisi delivers a brilliant performance as a preoccupied and distant husband.  Even Anna Faris makes an endearing appearance as a vapid, giggly blonde starlet shooting a Matrix-like action flick in Tokyo.  Not surprisingly, none of the Japanese characters are in any way developed.  (This, of course, would entail treating the Japanese characters as actual three-dimensional people instead of movie props, a possible complicating dynamic that Coppola is never in danger of broaching.)  Despite the skillfully executed performances, the actors and actresses still far short of the Herculean task of animating this lifeless material.
If you want a more satisfying film based on the same themes of lonely people finding each other in a cold and indifferent world, watch the British classic, ""Brief Encounter"" written by Noel Coward and directed by David Lean.  Instead of taking the easy way out and giving his character passports to an exotic and distant destination somewhere in the British Empire, Coward makes the decisive choice to couch the entire film in drab suburban England.  The sense of estrangement he creates is all the more heightened precisely because he doesn't flinch from the unrelenting loneliness and seclusion that one can find in the mundane and trivial setting of one's own home and community.",1084406400,6,3119,5.268686868686869
1503197,3,B00005JMJ4,"NOTE: Includes spoilers.

All I heard about for months from my American friends was ""Lost in Translation.""  As I live in Japan and actually played piano at the Park Hyatt in the New York Bar & Grill for several years, I finally broke down and bought the DVD. I was expecting to see something wildly different, not to mention gut-bustingly funny, based on the clever trailers.

I must honestly say that I almost turned off the film twice - especially during the karaoke sequence. As Sofia Coppola said herself, it was basically like a little ""home movie.""  She went to the places she liked, she had the ""characters"" (I use that word loosely) at the hotel she liked, and she kind of followed them around as they floundered about in Tokyo.

There were distinct moments when I thought Bill Murray (whom I love) was ad-libbing the scenes.  Also, as others have pointed out, there really isn't a plot.  Things just kind of unfold, and I too, felt the actors were just ""real"" people -- not really acting, just standing in front of a camera and making it up as they went along.

And yet... by the time the film got to the last minute, I felt something incredibly deep and sad.  I felt like the two leads had each found the right person and yet they would still be going back to the wrong lives.  It was very powerful, and despite the adlib feel of the entire film, when it came to the end, both the actors conveyed the emotion beautifully (something two ""real"" people off the street could not do).

Scarlett Johansson was so beautiful that it was worth watching the film just to look at her -- although I feel the opening shot was absolutely pointless and my first thought was ""Is Sofia a lesbian?""  I didn't get it at all.

The cinematography was great, and living here in Tokyo, I know how hard it was to get some of those incredible shots.

As far as the film being ""racist"" -- the only moment that I felt uncomfortable with was at the sushi restaurant.  It seemed like a weak, stupid joke, and the comment about the ""r's"" and ""l's"" was dumb as well -- but, hello, people -- this is how some people think and talk, especially those who have absolutely no understanding about Japan (like the Olsen twins, who said their only Japanese reference was ""Lost in Translation"" -- open a book, girls!).

One thing that people who rave about this film might consider doing is turning on the English subtitles.  They might be shocked at some of the inexplicable lyrics in the final song.  I don't know what Sofia was thinking, or if she was thinking at all.  She probably just liked the song.  I can't imagine she listened carefully to the words.

At any rate, if you don't mind taking a sort of ambling roundabout, strange and lazy journey through Tokyo for a couple of hours, you should (if you feel anything at all) be struck at how the last moment comes up and grabs you and makes you realize that maybe there is a right person in this world for each of us, but we may not realize it until it's too late -- or, even worse, may not make the effort to change our worlds to be with that person.",1084406400,3,3079,4.395061728395062
1503198,4,B00005JMJ4,"I finally rented this movie, having nothing to go on but the trailer and a few positive reviews.  I tend not to read too much about pictures until I've seen them; if I liked a film enough, I may obsess a bit and read up on what I can find about it.  This one, I liked enough.  The characters connected, and I appreciated both their situations.  They are both flawed, but their flaws are what make them human, and they are, through each other, coming to grips with these shortcomings.  One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Bob asks Charlotte, who is giving him the business over his dalliance with the hotel's lounge singer, ""Was there no-one else to lavish you with attention?""  A great put-down, and a very eye-opening moment about the limits of his investment in their relationship.  Yet in the end, their bond is deep.
As far as ""getting"" this picture or not goes, I have to think that people who don't have not perhaps experienced the crises faced by the two main characters, or else are of the ""buck up, little camper"" mindset that countenances little time spent in introspection about one's place in the world.  Bill Murray's performance is too nuanced for anyone coming to this with a ""make me laugh, funnyman"" attitude.  Though there are comedic bits, I didn't particularly see this as a comedy, and wasn't expecting to, either.  Besides his name on the marquee, I'm not sure what led those viewers so disappointed with this to come to it expecting some sort of laff riot -- none of the reviews I've now read paint it as such.  Scarlett Johannson was enthralling, particularly considering the fact that she turned 18 during the making of the film.  Usually one sees older actresses playing younger, but she very successfully turns this formula on its head.
I didn't see the film being particularly racist; the whole premise is that Bob and Charlotte are alone together in a very foreign place, and Sofia Coppola has taken steps to accentuate this.  In most cases, the Japanese people seemed quite normal; it's just that they inhabit a completely different world than the two protagonists, and speak a language that neither comprehends.
If your idea of a good time for two hours is watching things explode or laughing until you think you'll piss yourself, then by all means, stay away from this one.  If, on the other hand, you can appreciate the crises we face coming to grips with who we are, what we are doing with our lives, and why we are doing it, then I would suggest that you will very much appreciate this small, thoughtful film (budget was between 2 and 3 million dollars, I gather).
The dvd itself left something to be desired.  The transfer was generally good, though in the beginning there was some break-up in the dark backgrounds. The sound was very good. A commentary would've been nice, and I found it odd that Ms. Johannson was so completely neglected in both the interview and ""behind the scenes"" pieces.  Only one of the deleted scenes (a brief telephone interaction the morning after the karaoke party) seemed like it might've added anything.  Hopefully, a ""special edition"" will be forthcoming at some point in the future.",1084147200,5,3160,4.685352622061483
1503199,2,B00005JMJ4,"""The Virgin Suicides"" was a solid, though overrated, directorial debut for Sofia Coppola. Moody, ethereal and meaningful, it presented a promising director and one to follow closely. With ""Lost in Translation"", her sophomore effort, similar gloomy and melancholic atmospheres persist, yet the movie doesn`t quite work and fails to impress.
Sure, the idea of two lonesome individuals in a foreign land developing a peculiar relationship (friendship? love??) is somewhat enticing and could lead to a good introspective drama, still this cinematic experience drags too much and never seems to take off. Bill Murray plays, well, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson is cute but far from excellent on her role.
Trying to develop subjects like loneliness, communication and life choices, ""Lost in Translation"" only suceeds in delivering an indulgent story with uninteresting characters, enticing cinematography, a well-crafted atmosphere and a very good soundtrack (Air (again), Death in Vegas, Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine`s Kevin Shields, and many others).
This effort is a cheap way of discovering some places in Tokyo at night (offering a realistic, documentary-like style), but a movie should tell an absorbing story with memorable characters, and this one just falls flat. I`ll admit that it`s pretty and enchanting at parts, yet some nice visuals and neons aren`t enough to provide a (good) movie.
Disappointing and sterile.",1084147200,8,1437,5.536363636363636
1503200,4,B00005JMJ4,"It is surprising that this movie calls many to debunk the very quality of the atmosphere and poetic lyricism of its structure by saying that Sophia Coppola essentially doesn't stay in the lines while coloring an original piece of art of her own making.  It never ceases to amaze me how we live in what is supposedly the freest country in the world and yet so many Americans are deathly afraid and even contemptuous of artistic freedom when they find it.
Is LOST IN TRANSLATION short on plot?  Yes.  Are several scenes in which the actors portray their characters improvised? Yes.  Are the actors playing real people in real situations making flawed but human choices?  Yes.  And I can't imagine the people who did not like the film for these reasons--the central ones that made me give this movie four stars--enjoying much of anything beyond the standard action movie fare, with its mind-numbing cinematic conventions that are older than dirt and half as exciting.
Sophia Coppola--daughter of the master Francis himself--has made a fantastic exploration into human emotion and the depth of human longing and love with this film, in the frame of today's paradoxically plastic and ancient Tokyo.  Scarlett Johansson gives a performance that belies her age, carrying the expressions of emotions that seem to have a wisdom about them in their intensity.  And Bill Murray's work is reminiscent of Miles Davis; understated, cool, ragefully/triumphantly quiet at the perfect times, emotionally detached in his representation of passion and excitement at others.  He deserved the Oscar nomination for this work, as did Sophia for an enigmatic screenplay that deceptively reveals as much realism as any Impressionist piece by Monet or any of the photography of Steichen.
You won't need to try and enjoy this movie with an open mind or anything.  Just see it without trying to control it, and watch what happens.  It is sweet--not like candy, but like Peppermint Schnapps; with a bite.  And it is beautiful.",1084147200,11,1997,5.036474164133739

In this class, if the teacher is any good, you will learn the difference between mass-market popular fiction and true art. Need I make connections to film?
Many others have given good reviews, so I will not re-hash over the pros and cons. I will simply say this: the movie was good, with a few minor flaws (cliched poking fun at r and l mix-ups, the one instance of nudity..), and one MAJOR flaw: THE HUSBAND PLAYED BY GIOVANNI RIBISI IS TOTALLY AN UNBELIEVABLE CHARACTER, and even more unbelievable is how Johanssen's character would have ever married him.
I liked the tender, open-ended ending. I personally believe that this film is about a turning point in the lives of both Murray and Johanssen's characters. Enough said. 4.5 stars!",1084060800,,1000,4.655367231638418
1503314,5,B00005JMJ4,"I've read a lot of the reviews below and quite frankly I don't understand where they're coming from. I really loved this film.
The movie really conveys that feeling of loneliness and isolation which was intended by the director. Both character's are misfits, both are uncertain of their future, both have a false sense of superiority. The end result is this extreme alienation that the movie beautifully conveys. Many of the reviews below describe the film as pointless and boring. And I admit the story line is a bit thin, but ""Lost in Translation"" does something better than merely tell a story. It makes you feel, it makes you think, which is very uncommon of most movies these days.",1084060800,2,686,4.773109243697479

Put simply, it's a funny, sweet and endearing film which is beautifully directed.  I can't really understand why so many people found this boring.  This is one of the few films I've found truly enthralling.

Personally, I like to SEE the movie I'm watching.  90% of Lost in Translation is lost in the dark - you simply can't see it, which is something of a waste of time in my book.  And the supposed ""hilarity"" of it was also lost.  I did not laugh out loud once.  I stuck with it, and watched it all the way through, waiting, waiting for the funny scenes.  There was a bit of making fun of Japanese people's pronunciation of English words with ""r""'s in them, but that's a rather old joke.  Ms. Coppola must have paid off a LOT of people to get the reviews and nominations that she did, because I just wasted about $20 on the DVD.  Clearly, the joke was completely lost on me, which my boyfriend and I think may have been the point of the movie.  The whole thing is truly lost in translation.",1083888000,4,909,4.084745762711864

1503318,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is one of those rare movies that deserve the hype.  Unfortunately, the term ""hype"" is probably better attached to your various blockbusters. Imagine the hype over a good story by Chekov?  Normally, in our exploding, flashing entertainment world it isn't going to happen since the bar has been so lowered.  But that's where this story resides, in a land of nuance and quiet space (Bergman territory).  Such craftsmanship places demands on the viewer, just like a well written story places demands on a reader. Bittersweet is very hard to do, but this film pulls if off, right down to the last scene (the whisper was a perfect, hopeful, human touch.)  Murray deserved a nomination for this flick (though Sean Penn was overdue), but Scarlett Johansson also deserved recognition.  The intelligent dialogue between these two, the framing of scenes, the photography, all are excellent.  Easily a five star movie for the discerning viewer.",1083888000,3,954,5.116129032258065
1503319,1,B00005JMJ4,"I don't care what other people say about this film: IT IS BORING AS WATCHING YOUR HARD DRIVE REFORMAT ITSELF. It has no plot. It's just one boring event after another, spiced with vulgar elements that do nothing to help the story. This movie sucks. If you want to watch a foreigner trying to fit into the Japanese culture, watch Wasabi instead. It has humor, action, and a 45 calibur revolver. LiT will likely end up ""Lost in the back of my mind"" within a few weeks. It is JUST THAT BORING. The one star I give this movie is because it has some nice footage of Tokyo and the Japanese culture, and because I like Bill Murray, even if he was poorly used in this movie and wasn't 1/10th as funny as he was in his other movies (in fact, he's not very funny at all here). This movie deserved to get snubbed at the oscars, as much as it pains me to say it.

I will tell you what the film illustrated for me- the feeling of being alone, despite (or perhaps because of) the nearby maddening crowd.  And it is a funny film; not stupid slapstick comedy, but genuinely funny in a realistic way. Several scenes left me smiling about them for days.
Some viewers seem to have been surprised by the quality of Bill Murray's performance here.  While I do agree he was very convincing, I was not particularly surprised.  His character in this film actually seems to me as being similar to many of his other on-screen characters, only much more melancholy.  I attribute this to his maturing age, and maturing talent.
And I will go ahead and heap on some more praise for Scarlett Johansson.  She has a low-key way about her, which I think is rare for such a young actress.  This kind of quiet dignity lends more credibility to her performances.  That said, her physical resemblance to Jodie Sweetin is striking.  When I first saw Ms. Johansson in The Horse Whisperer, I could have sworn it was Stephanie Tanner from Full House.
Given the opportunity, I would happily watch this film again.  For me, that is the mark of quality and creativity.  I rarely watch any movie a second time.",1083801600,4,1309,4.575107296137339

Perhaps it's fitting for the title.  Not only were the characters, a young female and a middle-aged male, lost in their lives and alienated from their spouses, but they were lost in the linguistic and cultural world of Tokyo.  And to impart that lack of rootedness to the viewer, we have to wander with them, feeling the same lassitude and confusion.  I give it a few stars for taking a unique angle, but I didn't feel what I got from the movie was worth the time being lost.",1083801600,2,647,4.394957983193278
1503398,3,B00005JMJ4,"Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) are two lonely people stuck in the same Tokyo hotel. Harris is working on a whiskey commercial, seemingly estranged from his wife in the States. Charlotte's photographer husband leaves her alone while out doing photo shoots. Eventually the two meet and slowly become friends. There's not a great deal of dialogue, but what is said is true and from the heart. This is definitely not a `plot-driven' story. The visuals are interesting, but not unique and filmed nearly like a travelogue. There could have been more attention given to the editing, which at times seems choppy and inappropriately mixed. However, the sound is crisp and cleverly portrays the modern soul of Tokyo. This is an experience that needs to be taken in slowly to appreciate the moods and emotions that are almost too subtle. It is not a far stretch to imagine that Director Sofia Coppola probably took most of these dialogues form her own conversations with her father Francis. The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is part soul mate and part paternal. There is no sexual tension between the two and that makes this film separate from most Hollywood fare. Some of the episodes with Bob and the Japanese people were on the edge of condescension, with more than enough confusion on how the Japanese cannot speak proper English. It was overly used and an inappropriate motif. However, that's not enough to override the atmosphere of the film.

1503403,4,B00005JMJ4,"In my opinion, 'Lost in Translation' was a movie that will be difficult for me to forget, due to the acting of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. This movie is the best work that the vastly underrated Mr Murray has done since ""Groundhog's Day,"" and I feel that Ms Johansson has a brilliant career ahead of her. True, in some ways this is a movie ""Seinfeld,"" a movie about nothing: two lonely people meet in a foreign city where neither of them speaks the language, both of them are having problems within their respective marriages. Murray's marriage is obviously in trouble, and Johansson's is eventually going to need CPR. They spend some time together, nothing really seems to happen, except that it becomes clear to the viewer that they are indeed that overworked word: ""soulmates.""
Sophia Cappola wisely resisted the temptation to allow these two to consumate their relationship, which would have changed the entire dynamic of the film. When they finally fell onto a bed, they ended up sleeping, with Murray tenderly holding Johansson's foot. To sleep in the presence of another person, and in this case someone you hardly know, is a brave act, an act of trust (thank you, Dianah Gabaldon, for pointing this fact out in your wonderful book ""Outlander,"" which is also the story of two soulmates). At the end of the film, Murray's character seems to have awakened from a long sleep, which is a life where he has spent years just going through the motions. What will happen to the character when he leaves Japan is pure conjecture on the part of the viewer: I like to think he went home and told his wife that they needed to put their marriage on the right track, and was willing to live with the consequences if she failed to understand him.
I also particularly enjoyed the sequence at the beginning of the movie where Murray, looking like a burnt-out case, was filming the liquor commercial. A once big action star, his career had fallen so low that he was reduced to making commercials abroad. That he had virtually checked out of his life was evident, reinforced by him fleeing the hotel bar when he was recognized by two American fans. IMO it is a shame that Murray did not win an Oscar for this subtle performance. Ms Johansson turned in an intelligent performance of an intelligent young woman who seemed to have married too soon, and to someone who did not appear to be her intellectual equal, a young man superficial enough to be dazzled by a pretty air-head. It is difficult for me to believe that she was not nominated for an Oscar for either 'Lost in Translation' or 'The Girl with the Pearl Earring.' I am confident her day will come!",1083456000,4,2650,4.652452025586354
1503404,2,B00005JMJ4,"Quite frankly, this movie was average.  I am a person that usually loves independent or foreign movies, and that seemed to be when this movie came out the audience that it appealed to.  i just don't get it.  The only thing special about this film that I noticed was its attempt to be ""realistic"" and extremely melancholy boring feel, a type of portrait into the life of a buisnessman on a buisness trip or something (what could be more exciting!).  There is next to no plot.  Some people think that this is artistic or original.  It may very well be original, because most film makers aren't stupid and/or brave enough to make a movie without a plot.  I went into this movie open minded, I do to any movie that doesn't have Vin Diesel or Paul Walker in the cast, but this movie was just boring.  It isn't what I would call intellectually stimulating.  I suppose that you are kind of wondering at the end, but I didn't even care to try to find the ""deepness"".  Sometimes I wonder that in movies like this if everyone likes them just because their friends and/or favorite critics do.  Whatever
I was extremely disappointed that this seemed to beat Big Fish in practically every award for comedy this year.  David Lynch, Darren Aronofsky, Tim Burton, these are good film makers whos films stimulate the mind and have an orignal flair and a plot at the same time (yes, its possible).  This movie, in my opinion, just didn't have it.  It could have just as easily been a made for tv movie and the people who are giving it 5 stars now would be giving it 1 star for its cheesiness and bad filming.

This is the most pointless and boring film I've seen since ""About Schmidt"".  I know where Coppola was going with the film, as I have been stuck alone in Tokyo and other foreign cities numerous times, but she just wasn't able to pull it off.  The only thing she got right with this one was the quirkiness of modern Japanese pop culture.  The plot was too loose, and the only funny scene was the one in the exercise room.

1503406,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is a stylized version of real life. Two Americans find a peculiar kind of romance in Tokyo, shuffling from their hotel rooms to the hotel lounge to a night on the town. No matter where they go, there's a sense of loneliness. After all, they are both leaving soon, so there's no way they establish anything permanent while they're together. It's an ironic moment for both characters.
All of this stuff --- the mood, the characters' feelings, and their actions --- is filmed at the pace of real life. It's unlike  most films, where the boring parts of life are ditched, leaving only the exciting stuff. It's as if the director wanted to take a close look at being bored and out of place. That's not everyone's idea of a good time at the movies, so this film had received a mixed reaction.
But it's worth a look --- or maybe two. Underneath it all, it's a romantic comedy. If you watch it closely and get into the rhythm of it, you'll see a unique movie that takes the standard romantic comedy conventions and flips them upside down.",1083369600,,1050,4.49738219895288
1503483,4,B00005JMJ4,"In her second directorial project Sofia Coppola shows that her skills as a director were no mere fluke. This time she delves into the art of character study focusing on the lives of has-been actor Bob Harris, and unhappy and recently married Charlotte. What they both have in common is their feelings of unfulfillment in their lives, and this is magnified by their stay in Tokyo, Japan.
Many complain of the lack of plot to this movie, but as I see it, the action of the movie lies not in what happens, but rather in how the characters interact with each other. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson play off each other well, as they look to each other to find something familiar to hold on to. These characters are definitely three dimensional, living and breathing on their own due to the excellent casting. This is probably Bill Murray's finest work due to the similarity of his character to himself. It is a shame that he didn't get the oscar for this part.
The screenplay for this movie was simple and real, focusing on subtleties of commuinication and interacting, while giving us a glimpse of Japan's urban lifestyle. One must remember that this is the theme of the movie. We actually feel for Bob and Charlotte as they are unable to connect emotionally with the people around them. This is emphasized by the fact that they can't speak the language. The foreign aspect of Japan becomes a metaphor for their feelings of displacement in their lives. Often is the source of many of the humourous events in the movie, but it is done is a respectful manner showing Sofia's love for this city and country.

It's just a mediocre movie, so does Sophia's talent. I can see that she was telling some self-experiences in a slow-paced narrative way, trying to paint a beautiful cinematography, trying to add a little humor, sometimes by trying to ridicule Japanese... well, I can see the trying, but not so much of the result...
I don't see much plot to hold the movie; I don't see much chemistry developed by the two people; I couldn't feel any empathy at all for the character, the empathy that a movie usually brings out of audience. I wonder how she won the best screenplay `cause the flow of the movies feels a little choppy. You can't just tape some scenes in real life, and piece them here and there in the weak flow of the whole movie...
I guess maybe Hollywood usually honor the family tradition by giving her so much recognition, or Hollywood overall is sliding toward mediocre... it's not a bad movie, as a matter of fact, it's interesting to an extent if you want to see some foreign culture. In a word it's just a mediocre one... b.t.w.

Incredibly written and beautifully directed, Lost in Translation is a movie that some people get, some people don't.  I remember sitting in the theatre watching people (usually middle-aged) get up and leave, presumably because they were bored.  It's too bad that they really missed the point of the movie, or expected it to be something that it wasn't.  If you're expecting an action-packed drama or quirky romantic comedy, you'll be horribly disappointed.  But if you're looking for a beautiful and deep look at love and romance, give this movie a go.  Closest comparisons I could make would put this movie alongside Traffic, another oft-overlooked and critically acclaimed movie.
Lost in Translation is melodic in it's presentation, and the incredible dialogue, top-notch directing and perfect sound editing make this movie a gem.

There are some funny moments and Murray still has the same old charm, but, I was very disappointed by the end of the film. The plot is extremely weak and trust me, you've seen it before, many many times. Its basically about two people trapped in unhappy marriages and how they bond in an alien environment (Tokyo). That's it. Really.
The film tries too hard to justify the extremely thin storyline, which could have been told in less than an hour. The end actually comes as a surprise because you feel that part of the story is missing and that something else should happen. Very unsatisfying.
Its also quite unsympathetic to Japanese culture. I'm not Japanese and I'm also not easily offended, but if I was from Japan, I'd be angry at the film's portrayal of the country's culture as bizarre and unfriendly (as if major US cities is any less commercial and lonely. The American characters in the film should have felt right at home, especially since the Japanese pop culture portrayed is actually very much based on US pop culture).

Or it could have been done in a more exciting or interesting way that holds a viewers attention.........this way, the 'movie-documentary' is an evening wasted.

1503579,4,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray is a movie actor who has come to Tokyo to film whisky ads.  Scarlett Johansson plays the wife of a young photographer who is doing a shoot in Tokyo, but who is too busy to pay much attention to her.  They are both sleep-deprived and culture-shocked which seems like a good start to a relationship.  The movie pokes a lot of fun at the differences between American and Japanese cultures, from Bill Murray towering over the diminutive Japanese in an elevator, to a Japanese director who is trying to get Murray to look like Frank Sinatra of the ""lat pack"" (rat pack.)  Murray makes the most of these scenes and is hilarious as he gets carried away on an exercise machine and watches Japanese ladies prancing in a pool in a water aerobics class.  The movie is slow at the beginning and I kept wondering, ""What is the point to all of this"", but eventually the developing friendship between Murray and Johannson is a joy to behold and it doesn't need much plot to sustain it.  Some of the characters seem unnecessarily shrill, such as the movie star friend of Johannson's husband and the manic talk-show host who interviews Murray, but perhaps these characters just serve as a contrast to the laid-back and somewhat melancholy main characters.  All in all, this is a good film and I look forward to more pictures from Sofia Coppola.",1082764800,3,1339,4.624472573839663
1503682,2,B00005JMJ4,"This is a film that both my daughter and I were interested in seeing, given the acclaim that Bill Murray's performance had drawn. Moreover, the film itself had drawn critical acclaim. So, when my daughter was home from college one weekend, we decided to hunker down and watch it together. When we both fell asleep while watching it, we decided that we were just tired. So, we decided to give it another go around the next evening. Well, unlike love, it was not much better the second time around, though we managed to avoid falling asleep, yet again.
Quite frankly, if Sophia Coppola, the writer and director of this film, were not the daughter of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, I am convinced that this film would have quickly vanished without a trace. In fact, I doubt that it would even have been made. When her acting career fizzled, after making her less than memorable acting debut in her father's film ""Godfather III"", Sophia Coppola apparently turned her hand to directing and was let loose upon an unsuspecting public.
While this film has good production values, it simply meanders along in a loosey-goosey sort of way. If focuses upon two individuals, Americans who find themselves in Tokyo, alienated from their surroundings and, seemingly,  from life in general. One of these individuals is Bob Harris, a film actor on a career downslide, who now finds himself shilling whiskey in Japan for mega bucks, while his movie career is at an impasse. The other is a beautiful twenty-five year old woman, a Yale Graduate with a degree in philosophy, who is in Japan with her husband, a photographer who is working on a shooting assignment.
Bob Harris, played with wry bemusement by Bill Murray, is a man who is alienated from his family and, quite frankly, just plain lonely. His is a stark universe, as he seems to have a myopic view on life, seeing little beyond his luxury hotel's bar, where he like to go and drink. Charlotte, played with surprising maturity and flair by eighteen year old Scarlett Johansson, feels bereft and set adrift, as she struggles to keep herself occupied while her husband is ostensibly working. It is these two souls whose worlds collide, coloring their perspectives on life when an unlikely bond forms between them.
The film, which takes place in Tokyo, Japan, appears to mock the Japanese. Its stereotypic portrayal of the Japanese people, generally as buffoons, is reprehensible and a cheap joke. Sophia Coppola apparently thinks that the way Japanese people speak English is funny, as it  is a running, unfunny joke through out the film. Since the film takes place in Japan, perhaps it might have been funnier to see Bob (or Charlotte) attempt to speak Japanese, rather than turn Bob into the quintessential ugly American.
The film meanders along lacking a definitive narrative and any real profundity of thought. While there is definition about the characters' exterior selves, the film never delves into their inner selves in defining their present state of affairs. There are no big or traditional cinematic moments. Unfortunately, there are no small ones either, as there is really no  introspection by either of the two protagonists.  This is a film that viewers will either love or hate. I fall into the latter category. ""Lost in Translation""  is simply lost on me.",1082764800,7,3320,4.910873440285205
1503683,5,B00005JMJ4,"This movie is indeed the defining role for Murray. I am looking forward to watching Sofia Copola's career develop and will watch anything she makes because of this movie.

Instead I found this to be a depressing, non-acted film where the Japanese were made to sound stupid because Bill Murray's character simply didn't want to take the time to learn and understand anything about this marvelous place and its citizens. Here he and Johannson's character had the opportunity of a lifetime to enjoy Japan and all it has to offer and instead they were maudlin and condescending.  This could have been a good film...it was not but that may be because I personally know what the characters  missed. Regardless, I think the movie cast Japanese people from a less than positive vantage point which was offensive to me and I think will be to others.",1082764800,5,813,4.638888888888889
1503685,3,B00005JMJ4,"It is hard to describe this film.  To do so would leave the other person somewhat bewildered as to why you would be suggesting they spend an hour or two of their life watching other people just hang out.  In fact, that just about does describe the film.  Set in Tokyo, a famous actor is being paid well to shoot commercials about whiskey, while being shouted at in Japanese.  In the same hotel is a young wife who is traveling with her photographer husband, and is left to wander around while he works all the time.
And?  Well that's about it.  Half the time while watching the film I thought to myself, ""something did get lost in translation"", because how in the world did this film get nominated for best picture?  Yet, the rest of the time I did get drawn in to the wonderful mood.  Life sometimes finds us in moments which create a whole lifetime by themselves. We find ourselves somewhere we do not really want to be, but when connections are made, we may not want to leave. Once back in our routine these moments may fade away, but while in them, we lived briefly another life altogether. This is the way the film ""worked"" for me.  I did not want the film to end, but yet I did not want anything ""big"" to happen either as that would have spoiled the reality.
Is the acting as good as people say it is?  Who knows?  I guess I really did buy into these people, as if it really was Bill Murray, stuck in a hotel and surrounded by glad-handling Japanese people, and connecting with this young woman in a friendship that is full of sexual tension which is thankfully never acted on.  So I guess the acting is sound in that regard.
Overall, I think this is a film that a person will either be drawn in to, or bored to death.  But for what it is, it does capture the emotions and mood of the moment well.  Like the characters it depicts, the audience may also get to live a another short lifetime in a Tokyo hotel.",1082764800,3,1913,4.2631578947368425
1503686,4,B00005JMJ4,"Sophia Coppola's Lost in Translation is an exercise in character presentation and development.  As you probably know, there is little plot to follow, and no hair raising twists to shock you.  What you do have are two characters you have never seen before, yet you can probably identify with both of them a lot of the time.  Their platonic friendship is refreshing; it's so common these days for strangers to meet, feel attraction, and jump into bed for no reason except that it's in the script.  Because this movie chooses not to go that route, the characters are forced to show us their personalities on the screen, and that turns out to be much more entertaining than I expected it to be.
Bill Murray plays an actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a series of ads for a whiskey.  He finds Japan strange; the opening scenes of the movie show him landing on his plane and looking at the culture shock before him.  He has a lot of down time.  We only see him working a few scenes.  The rest of the time, he is wandering through Tokyo with no direction whatsoever.  It is here that Murray's comic ability comes through.  He has done so many comedies that require a large amount of physical acting, here, the looks on his face are all it takes.  When he is in an elevator and he is a foot taller than every other man in there, he has a look on his face that evokes a chuckle.
Scarlett Johannsen plays a young newlywed whose husband (Giovanni Ribisi) is a photographer on assignment.  He is always working, leaving her alone to do nothing.  She wanders around, just like Murray.  Eventually they meet in a bar (which they both frequent often).  They strike up a friendship and spend lots of time together doing various things.  Murray is in his 50's and Johannsen is supposedly in her early 20's (although she is really only 18), which in recent cinema has meant a May-December romance.  But not here.  Both are married (Murray's wife calls and sends faxes asking him which color carpet he wants in the house) and there is a great scene where Murray tells Johannsen why marriage is tough, especially once you have kids.
It's not so much about the characters being ""real"" as I have seen from reviewers here.  It's about being able to identify with them.  I was able to see myself and alot of what I feel from the characters on the screen.  Kudos to Murray.  I found him funnier and more entertaining here than I have in a dozen of his comedies before.  Movies are not about special effects, or about shocking moments.  They have always been, and will always be about characters.  I found these two very interesting.",1082764800,3,2603,4.498933901918977
1503687,5,B00005JMJ4,"The best movie I've seen in a long time. I understand why the average american Joe would not find it as good as others would. It had to do mainly with the fact this movie wasn't targeted for the typical hollywoodian audience.  It covers a human dimension that doesn't necessarily exist in a north american civilisation accustomed to cliches and lacking true travel experience. Actually one would probably have to have lived abroad to understand this movie and the characters, as well as the whole atmosphere that being in Tokyo brings to the picture. But it's defnitely not necessary, provided one has an imagination.
  For my part I have lived in Japan for 7 years, 6months of which in Tokyo, and to my surprise, the first dance club they visited in the film was also the first one I was invited too.. very funky place with funky people. Good choice on Coppola!
  The choices of actors is excellent and Scarlett definitely shines and makes one nostalgic of those days in Tokyo.  As for Bill Murray, he is the perfect choice to play the role of a family man bored in Tokyo, but experiencing something entirely new and refreshing. He doesn't bring with him the pretence that Japan is a stupid place, even though like most new foreigners in Japan would, he enjoys goofing around with the people.
  All in all, a refeshing and long overdue movie dealing with Japan, with true to life situations and characters.  The only thing missing are the japanese women, but then again, who would care in the presence of the lovely and sexy Scarlett.",1082764800,5,1535,4.676579925650557

This film asks a lot of the viewer, the characters don't share every though and feeling in long, overly scripted monologues.  Two disenfranchised people find solace in one another's company.  It's so simple a premise, yet there is so much going on, on an emotional level.  If I don't get this film for my birthday I'm going to hugely disappointed.
I'm not going to try and generalize.  I'm not going to say all people who like this film are this, and all people who hate this film are that.  Things affect people differently.

I wanted to like it so much, I tried to convince myself as I was watching it, ""Yeah, I like this.  This is good.""  Well, thirty minutes later, I realized it wasn't working.

Bill Murray plays a washed up actor that has traveled to Japan to do a Bourbon ad.  Scarlett Johansson is there with her photographer husband.  They are both feeling isolated and bewildered by their surroundings and gravitate towards one another.  That is the premise and it is a good one. There is a little sexual tension and there is supposedly a profound connection made.

I don't see it.  I did not see the connection made.  To make this kind of film come across, it must be sparse and subtle, but there has to be SOMEthing there.  The scenes between the two leads are so empty; nothing is expressed or communicated.  Therefore, the intended catharsis at the end falls flat.

Those looking for something different from Hollywood, something more intelligent and engaging, will embrace this film.
We all have undoubtedly found ourselves in places and situations where we felt we didn't belong, where we question the decisions and circumstances that brought us there.  This movie gives a very honest portrayal of two individuals in that situation, at a common time, in a common place, and reminds us that we are never alone in feeling alone.

1503778,4,B00005JMJ4,"The opening shot of this film during the titles pretty much sets the direction of this 'little film'; the camera lens aimed squarely on Scarlet Johansson's backside.  Sofia Coppola is positively in love with this actresses' body, as becomes rather apparent in the course of the film.
In between times, we have Johansson's character, a philsophy major graduated from Yale who nevers cracks a book in the film, embroiled in an inexplicably improbable marriage with an impossibly shallow character.  Bill Murray, playing himself (something he's become really good at doing with advancing age and experience), is in a similarly mismatched marriage.  These two Americans in temporary residence at a posh hotel in Japan wind up having a bit of a fling, albeit Platonic, but with a cryptically intimate ending.
Is there a story in this?  Hard to say. It's mostly episodic with glimpses at Japanese society on several different levels: religious ceremony, the hotel/bar/lounge scene (with evidence of America's intrusion), the youth party scene and other nighttime activities (including a great moment with Karaoke, with again evidence of U.S. intrusion), the advertising world, talk show moments, and overall manners.
But the camera is all too often on Johansson's body as if this were the sole motivation for the film.  Notwithstanding Sofia's chief interest in this film, it's worth seeing at least once, for Murray's straight man to Japan's parade of clowns.  Great fun!

An Oscar nod for Sofia Copola had also led me to believe that this would be something special, but even as a fan of Bill Murray I find it hard to recommend. A very slow beginning finds Bill Murray out of his depth in Tokyo as a flagging actor promoting a brand of whiskey. Anyone who has ever been to Tokyo will know it is NOT a very visitor friendly place, from the point of view of little, or no maps, tourist information, direction signs, assistance, or even menu's printed in English (or any other language except Japanese for that matter) and Ms Copola tries hard to portray this, and the quirky Japanese culture on screen at every given moment. Sadly though, this, and the gentle, if unlikely romantic chemistry between this lost actor in a failing marriage, and young newlywed unsure of her decision or life in general, that could be full of hilarious nuances just doesn't come across. I found myself skipping forward just to see if ANYTHING was going to happen, but was left feeling like a waste of just over 1hr 40 mins.

Yes, many have said how ""real"" this film is but realism often equals boredom and I caught myself being bored about halfway through this film. In my opinion, there was not that much substance in this film. It was basically a pseudo-intellectual film about a young lady and an old guy who become friends and the needs they have and momentarily fufill with each other. Look a bit further and you'll see the ""real, courageous"" portion of the film: how life is basically very simple and redundant - no matter the age or dreams(shattered or wished) - and how quickly we all can become bored with it. That's it. Case closed. There's nothing else. No secret answers to life. No hidden codes or messages.

My fiance and I discussed it at length, trying to understand why we didn't like it or why we didn't ""get it"". Then it hit me - it shouldn't be this hard. Just because some people consider it a great work doesn't mean everyone will. Murray has a few funny lines as you would expect, but the dialogue is extremely limited. A close friend of mine loved the movie because ""she knows what it feels like to be lost"" - she connected with Scarlett Johansson's character. I'm not sure if that means anything.

One of the most interesting aspects of LIT is the market's reaction to it:  most of those who caught it in a theater loved it, and a great many who've seen it first on DVD are angry with it.
Why?
1) Well, the grouches are quite right--it's not much of a comedy, there's very little story, and the characters aren't going through giant transformations across the course of the film.  If you're sitting at home with your significant other or a bunch of friends, if you're talking, if the sound of crunching snacks in your head is louder than the soundtrack, if the lights are on or the phone rings, forget it, you're done--it's like visiting a zen rock garden with a GameBoy, and your only shot at liking this film is personally relating to what the characters have experienced, or if you've been to Tokyo.
2) The rabid fans are quite right too--LIT is an ""experience"" film that is mismarketed as a Bill Murray comedy; it's all about sights and sounds, not story.  It lets you know this from the very first shot, a long, wordless look at, um, Scarlett Johansson, with a quietly rising and subsiding sound clip from Kevin Shields, the songwriter of the greatest lost band of last twenty years, My Bloody Valentine (if you don't know, YOU BETTER ASK SOMEBODY).  There's every chance this bombs at home, but in a theater, in the dark, with great sound and everybody shutting up, it works.
That first shot sets the tone for LIT.  There's not a single jump cut or sudden burst of sound in the entire film--it's supposed to be a slow, alluring, engulfing experience; again, this is terrific in a theater, but it's a fragile spell, and it's easy to see why it might not work at home.
3) The grouches are also right when they criticize the dialogue.  In literal terms, not a lot is being said.  If you don't attach to the characters at all, it isn't hard to start hating a young, pretty, apathetic whiner and a rich middle-aged whiner, both given the luxury of fretting full-time over existential problems, which, if you don't like the leads, seem pretty trivial.  It's not hard to see why that doesn't make for a fun movie night.
4) The rabid fans can argue this one--LIT is very much about what's NOT said.
Think about the most verbal characters in the film: they're babbling.  The sweetly inattentive husband is wildly inarticulate--he's perpetually distracted, and constantly interrupting his own train of thought.  The starlet (a snarky sendup of Cameron Diaz) grows more vapid by the sentence.  Bill Murray's wife is nothing but a telephone voice, transfixed by carpet swatches and bored by everything else.  And from the dead-serious commercial director to the ebulliently idiotic talk show host, there's no clear translation of the spoken Japanese.  For God's sake, when she over-emotes her way through Scarborough Fair, the lounge singer is a self-parody, unintentionally echoing Bill Murray's famous SNL parody of a lounge singer pouring out Scarborough Fair.  Every one of them is lost in translation.
In a different way, so are Bob and Charlotte.  The reason LIT doesn't have a story is that the entire film is an interlude--two people who suddenly find themselves together, sharing a break from their lives.
And they both seem to really need it--they're sick of the meaningless conversations and logistics that drive their worlds.  It's a classic use of the medium, to show the huge gap between what's said and what's seen.  Bob and Charlotte are wonderfully quiet and accepting of each other from the get go--they don't have talk much to connect.  If you watch for it, there's a silent shift in the film:  before she meets Bob, Charlotte is rattled by how numb she feels when she visits a temple and retreats to her hotel room, surrounding herself with junk media.  Before Bob meets Charlotte, he sleepwalks through his workday, producing junk media.  After they meet, when they spend time on their own, they wander wordlessly and beautifully alone:  Bob golfs by himself with Mt. Fuji in the distance, and Mt. Fuji floats by Charlotte on a Kyoto bullet train, as she heads off to visit another temple.  They're discovering a less bewildering, more personal Japan, and retrieving themselves as they do it.  And all this is shown, not spoken.
5) The grouches have a point: nothing freaking happens in LIT.
6) The fans answer:  yeah, exactly.  The key to the film is what doesn't happen between the characters.  It's no accident that LIT takes place in bustling, frenetic Tokyo, or that the main characters are hopelessly jetlagged and out of sync with everything except each other.  If that doesn't sink in early, then you'll miss the many charms of LIT, from the long, lovely shots, the sweet, spare exchanges between Bob and Charlotte, the gorgeously slow shoegazer/trip-hop/dream pop soundtrack (the best since Trainspotting, High Art,and Ms. Coppola's last film, the Virgin Suicides), and the electrifyingly silent ending.
So, sorry if you hated this film.  Have a drink, maybe two, turn the off lights, don't talk, watch it again, and you might change your mind.
(Oh, and if you take into account EVERY image of Japanese people in this film--the businesspmen and women, the artists, the florists, the crowds in the street, the surfers, the strippers, the monks, the bride and groom, the elderly patient, the doctor, etc.--it's harder to argue that LIT is an anti-Japanese film, and easier to see it for what it is:  an outsider's POV of a few silly and sublime experiences in an unfamiliar culture).",1082332800,45,5509,4.817409766454352

1503874,1,B00005JMJ4,"I have reached the conclusion that all critics who love this movie have not seen the films of Wong Kar-Wai. This is a truly abysmal imitation of a Wong film (Sofia Coppola thanked the director in her Oscar speech for ""inspiration""), in particular ""In the Mood for Love"". Whereas Wong's film boasts sparse but rich dialogue, a complex storyline, beautiful cinematography and enchanting music, Coppola's imitation has sparse and pointless dialogue, an underdeveloped and shallow plot, and merely modest cinematography and musical direction. Murray does a fine job in this movie, but Coppola clearly has very little to offer other than truly offensive stereotypes of Japanese people. Watching this movie was a totally painful experience for me, and I am so glad that I only rented it from the video store, to which I promptly returned the DVD. I recommend everyone to stay away from this movie and buy something from Wong Kar-Wai instead. Try ""In the Mood for Love"" or ""Chungking Express""...you will be amply rewarded.

1503876,5,B00005JMJ4,"Like a nice dream that you wake up from with a smile on your face that will in turn make your day, this is exactly the feeling I got after watching Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola's second feature after her acclaimed debut Virgin Suicides. The first thing that struck me was how original the film was, and how simple and gentle the plot is,yet at the same time how deeply significant dealing with themes that many viewers can identify with about friendship,alienation, and loneliness.
Certainly it has one of the most original opening scenes,I would go as far as saying,in Cinema history..one that will 'stare you right in the face' and will definitely bring a smile.
Bob Harris an aging movie star who has clearly seen better roles is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial, also staying in the same hotel is Charlotte a east side intellectual young wife who is with her very busy photographer husband.
In between discovering a whole new city, and finding some difficulties adjusting to the jet lag, the language barrier and their respective state of loneliness away from home, they meet up and form a friendship that will help them cope with their temporary but bewildered and confused situation.
Through their encounters, we learn that their friendship was not only sealed because of homesickness, but because they both found in each other a needed breath of fresh air that enlivened the dull routine of their lives both in Tokyo and the US. Indeed, Tokyo is only a place that triggers and exposes the deep need for change, albeit short lived because at the end, when the actor's job is done, he knows that now matter how much he found in Charlotte some comfort in his middle age crisis that was turning into affection and intimacy, and no matter how much Charlotte found in the actor the stimulation and closeness she lacks in her marriage, each will soon have to go back to their respective lives and families.
The last scene when Harris stops his cab after spotting Charlotte and runs to her, whispering something that remains intelligible, then they kiss for the first time, and he departs smiling, was a very powerful one indeed..it opens lots of unanswered possibilities as to the nature of this brief conversation, but it really does not matter because they finally depart for the first time in their stay satisfied.
Bill Murray, I believe contributed greatly to the movie's success..He is a truly comedy genius that reminds me of Peter Sellers or even Louis De Funes, actors who can express so much just with one look. Scarlett Johansson was a very able match, playing against a comedy giant like Murray, and I believe she is one of the best actresses of her generation, (and yes she has a really sweet laugh).
The writing was excellent and Coppola managed to infuse gentle humor with three dimensional characters and with lots of sympathy, compassion and dignity.
Lost In Translation therefore is a type of movie that is rarely filmed these days, one that is beautifully shot, written,and directed by a woman who proved that the term Daddy's girl is in her case, very well earned.",1082246400,2,3095,4.786915887850467
1503877,4,B00005JMJ4,"I liked this movie. The plot is quite standard for a ""romance"" movie: two adults are in bad marriages on their own, get attracted to each other and try to figure their way about it. The tiny twist here comes from the huge age difference between the characters. It stops them from really developing a romance, they never get into sack as the old guy wouldn't know what the young girl would think of him if he even tried. So they end up enjoying each others' company in platonic manner and they seem to wander half-lost without knowing what to do. The audience sees the couple enjoy spending time with each other but also realise it is nigh-on impossible for them to split from their unsatisfying marriages to really get together... Yet, they long each others' company and don't know what to do about it. The slow suspence comes from trying to guess how they'll solve their lives and relationships.

1503878,2,B00005JMJ4,"The film certainly creates - in a convincing way - the atmosphere that would make it difficult for an uninspired foreigner on a short stay in Tokyo to be anything but bored.  Unfortunately the proliferation of simple sentences made up of simple words in the screenplay not only made it boring for this viewer but also failed to convince me that any meaningful relationship could develop between the young wife (Johansson) and the older actor (Murray). The screenplay was unable to lift the film above the level of the ""elevator"" music that anaesthetized the patrons of the hotel bar. I gave it 2 stars for atmosphere and the film work.  The non-plot and non-acting was worth a big fat zero.
This DVD is not worth owning or renting.",1082246400,2,731,4.703125
1503952,3,B00005JMJ4,"After watching this movie, I felt the confusion and perhaps frustration of visiting another 'world' where the main language is not English.  When I went to Montreal, Quebec I somewhat felt the way Bill Murray's character went through.  On the otherhand, since I had studied French from grade school to grade nine, I have to say that Ontario's education towards French sucks!  I could not speak nor understand much of what the French people were saying.  However, I were able to read French so I managed to find my way.
I'm not quite sure why a review said that it was ""hilarious"".  Is it because it's funny to see other people go through this turmoil of being lost and not speaking the native language?  I would feel embarrassed if I were to laugh at another person just because of language and cultural differences.  Hee hee Kinda reminds me of how my country, ""Canada"" was named... ^_^;;;
Perhaps it was a cultural shock for most foreigners who have not visited Asian areas to find it so different?  Video arcades in asian malls and plazas in Toronto have many of the games of when Scarlett's character was wandering through in Japan.  I only wish we had a UFO Catcher that actually has the cute anime ufo plushies! XD  Karaoke is very popular in Japan and it's gaining popularity here in Toronto.  It's just expensive especially at Pacific Mall. T_T;
I thought this movie was excellently protrayed as a third-person being lost in a completely different world.  The only downfall was that there was not very much of a story.  Bill and Scarlett would always meet and drink alcohol.  Personally I did not think drowning yourself in alcohol would be a good idea especially if you are in a different country where you do not know much of the laws.  You might get yourself into trouble but you may not remember much as you were drunk! =P  I guess that is the western's culture of drinking to loosen up and whatnot.
This was the first film I have seen by Sofia Coppola and thought she did good in the directing but the story... there wasn't much there.  I think because of her family's connection in the entertainment business was why this movie got so much publicity compared to other Oscar nominated movies (excluding LOTR3 of course! =P).",1082246400,2,2237,4.637055837563452

1503954,4,B00005JMJ4,"I'm a Japanese man and has just returned from seeing ""Lost in Translation,"" which opened today in Tokyo. Having read some reviews beforehand, I expected the movie might not be very enjoyable, but I find it fascinating instead. I was not offended at all by it and actually laughed many times watching
the movie.
I think that the movie captures fairly well how contemporary Japan, in which modern, busy parts are mixed with old, serene traditions in a chaotic way, looks to the two Americans who have little knowledge about or interest in the country they are staying. I can understand well that they feel lost, surrounded by a language, people, and customs they are not familiar with.
With regard to the pronunciation, I think that any Japanese who has once learned English knows that it is very difficult to make a distinction between ""L"" and ""R"", as there is no such distinction in Japanese. And I understand well that would be funny to native speakers of English, as the two Americans in the movie.
But I think that would be the case when you hear foreigners speaking your mother tongue, not limited to English. I'm happy to tell my friends coming from abroad that it is not easy for Japanese to make distinctions not only between ""L"" and ""R"", but also between ""B"" and ""V"", ""TH"" and ""S"" and some others.
On the scene of the prostitute, I think it is a little bit overdone. And the scene of the nude dancers would not be really necessary to the plot of the movie. But such dancers do exist in Tokyo, and you could go to see them if you would like to, however disturbing that might be.
I think it is true that Japanese characters in U.S. movies tend to be portrayed as one-dimensional, lacking emotional or intellectual depth, but that is not new, and Japanese are all aware of that. As far as I understand, the focus of the movie is not on forming a relationship between the two Americans and the Japanese surrounding them, but rather lack of it, corresponding to their lives back in their home country. In that sense, I think it would be appropriate for the movie to emphasize that they don't understand what the Japanese are talking or doing around them.
Some people might enjoy laughing at the Japanese who mix ""L"" and ""R"", but as far as I'm concerned, I'm rather amused by the Americans who are confused in a foreign country of which they have little knowledge. I even guess there might be some Americans who are offended by this portrayal of their fellow
citizens as being ignorant and arrogant.

yes. this movie is boring if you need alot of dialouge or a loud explosion every couple of minutes to keep you awake during a movie. but this is one of the best and most well crafted films i have ever seen. Two married strangers are bassically stranded in Tokyo and fall in love almost by accident. The ending is perfect for the film. Many people say it doesn't resolve anything and that it's unclear, but that's the point. It leaves you feeling weirdly comforted and you can't figure out why.

Why did it take so long to get released in Japan (today 4/17/2004)? And why only one theater in Tokyo? The lines were very long, and typical of Tokyo they sell more tickets than seats available, so many sat on the floor or stood. This underscores the film that many don't get... a megalopolis of 30 million, and foreigners on the fringe. I appreciate that Sophia Coppala spent a lot of time here, and it is very evident in the film. WOW. How touching, even for the Japanese who saw life through our eyes. The best part is after leaving the theater, the facination continued through this great experience I'm having here in Tokyo in my life.

Bill Murray plays the struggling actor character with much honesty, and Johansen plays the confused 20 something well too.  Set in a vibrant setting, the outlandish Tokeo, this film centers around the two leads.  They constantly bump into each other and grow a friendship.  It is very sweet to watch the two together who have this weird chemistry on screen.  The only complaint about this film, is that you sit through an hour and a half of PG rated humor and then suddenly, Bill Murray is sitting in a strip bar watching a Japanese stripper.  I though the film could've done without the scene but that might be the only way Sofia Coppola could sell her film.

It's slow in spots but Bill Murray is inspired and Scarlett Johansson is touching, and the last 30 minutes are genuinely poignant.  I think the reason this film has been so praised is because it is so different from most commercial Hollywood movies out there.  But I remember the movies from approximately 1967 to 1981, and believe me, this is what they used to be like before Spielberg and George Lucas infantilized them and dumbed them down.  Characters and stories were allowed to be complex and adult, like a good short story (like this film.)

1504054,5,B00005JMJ4,"Over 1,200 reviews so why add my own? Because I can't understand why the average rating is so low. This is a great movie but perhaps it's too sly and understated in a time when over-the-top is almost the rule in movies. Murray is dead-on and hilarious but he doesn't crack jokes or clown around much to make you smile, it's more subtle than that.
Most of the humor is in the gentle mocking of Japanese culture and the two leads' reactions to it. Not in a mean-spirited way but there are aspects of their culture, especially the way they react to our culture, that are very amusing. This was understated, too, and well-handled since it could easily have become too mocking.
Johannson is also great, this was the first time I'd seen her in a film and I was SO glad they didn't cheapen their friendship with any Hollywood-style romance. She's far too young for him and they both know it but they also are aware that it's unfortunate because they would have made a good couple. I dreaded the sight of them going the May-December route right up until the last moment and then I almost applauded.
I don't have any complaint to make about this film except that I wish we could see these characters again. All in all, this is a great film with moving performances, great cinemetography and just the right mix of humor and pathos.

I think that all of the excitement over this movie was due to the director's last name.

1504058,2,B00005JMJ4,"Alright now most reviews I saw here that were negative about the film were actually short and didn't appear to have any thought put into them at all, whereas the positive reviews were the exact opposite, I am going to try and clarify why I really did not think this movie was all that impressive and definitely not all it was hyped up to be.
First of all I do believe that this movie is extremely longwinded, it takes forever to get from one scene to another it seems, up to the point where you want to reach through the screen and literally push the characters into the next scene. The movie failed to entertain me for almost the entire time that I sat through it. It never got my excited where I wanted to see what was going to happen next.
Yes the scenery is amazing and it makes you want to go visit downtown Tokyo straight away, and of course Bill Murray delivers one of the best performances of his life-time and when you are talking about an actor like Bill Murray that is saying something, he is truly phenomenal in this role but even he cannot force me to watch this movie again. Even though I believe that his acting was great I do believe that the Academy made the right decision in passing him over and giving the Oscar to Sean Penn just because Mystic River was a much better movie.(...) believe everyone got caught up in the hype with this movie, does it look great at times. Yes it does. Does Bill Murray deliver one of the best performances of his career and does he literally drag the movie around on its back to make it even barely watchable...yes he does...is this Sophia Coppola's best movie? Not even close, if you want to see what I consider to be her finest work then be sure to check out the Virgin Suicides, which although isn't a feel-good movie is a very powerful work of art. In my humble opinion this movie was overrated and not all it was hyped up to be, however you might enjoy it...to each his own.",1081900800,,1930,4.304945054945055
1504059,2,B00005JMJ4,"I am pretty disgusted with the majority of the 5-star reviewers here, who relish in pointing out how the rest of us common folk just can't comprehend the ""real meaning"" behind this film; that we're just not worthy enough to understand the deep emotional complexity that is right there before our eyes.  Give me a break.  Can't you accept that different people have different taste in movies and leave it at that?  I'm very sorry if I can't match your superior level of sophistication, but please permit me to put forth my opinion anyway.
Two of my all-time favorite films are Neil LaBute's ""In the Company of Men"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors,"" both of which are comprised almost entirely of dialogue and nothing else.  There are no car chases, fight scenes, fart jokes, or gratuitous sex in either one.  They were also shot in an eavesdropping, ""fly on the wall"" manner.  All of this makes them very similar in style to ""Lost in Translation.""  But the big difference is that LaBute's films had original ideas and engaging characters, while Sofia Coppola's doesn't.
The whole ""Two strangers in a strange land meet and find happiness together"" plotline became a cliche before Bill Murray was born.  And many of the other elements don't ring true at all.  For instance, Charolette's husband John, who has just gotten married, suddenly becoming interested in an obviously airheaded blonde bimbo actress played by Anna Faris.  Even if it were a purely physical attraction, and while Faris is certainly a beautiful actress, there is no man or woman I know who would prefer her to Scarlett Johansson.  Ditto that for the lounge singer that Bob Harris decides to sleep with after just meeting her.  Bits like these feel convoluted and manufactured in order to provide even more cliched moments like the jealous wife, and the moment when she knocks on her newfound companion's door just in time to catch him with --GASP!-- another woman, which of course leads to the obligatory tearful argument followed by the kiss-and-make-up scene.
Basically, everything in this movie has been done many, many times before, which makes Sofia Coppola's Best Screenplay Oscar seem pretty baffling.  And while both the lead actors do an o.k. job, there's nothing in the performances that makes the material any more interesting than it sounds.  As another reviewer pointed out, there seems to be a big difference in opinion between those people who saw ""Translation"" in a theater and those who watched it on video, so I think it would be wise to lower your expectations if you're planning on picking this one up.",1081814400,7,2590,4.883561643835616
1504060,5,B00005JMJ4,"The last time, at least that I'm aware of, that Bill Murray tried serious acting was in ""The Razor's Edge."" I thought it was a good film, but he was excoriated by most critics and fans thinking they were coming to see a standard Bill Murray vehicle. Fortunately, this time around he has received richly deserved accolades for his performance.
""Lost in Translation"" essentially follows Bob Harris (Murray) and Charlotte  (Scarlett Johansson), as they both find themselves lost and adrift in Japan. Bob is a fading action star, who apparently is past his heyday and takes a job promoting a Japanese liquor for $2 million. Little hints along the way indicate he probably could use the money. It appears he has been appearing in plays and probably making decent but not necessarily great money. His wife is on a remodeling binge, which seems to hint at the fact that the big paycheck is something she has looked forward to. But Bob is more troubled by his life in general than by financial matters. He feels disconnected from his wife and children and can't seem to find a way to re-connect with them. He's in the midst of a midlife crisis and has no idea what to do about except withdraw into himself.
Charlotte is in somewhat similar straits. She is questioning her two-year marriage to a photographer who has brought her along to Japan for a shoot but he is gone much of the time. She feels no connection to her husband and, worse, doesn't know what she is supposed to do with her life.
Bob and she eventually meet and become friends. soul mates in fact, and writer/director Sophia Coppola wisely avoids what nearly any other writer and director would have done with the relationship-throw them in bed together. Instead the two develop a far more intimate relationship as they wander Tokyo and face an impending separation when Bob must return to America.
This is very much a thinking person's film. There's no real action (well, at one point they are chased out of a bar by a bartender toting some kind of weird gun) but you remain engrossed. The two leads give incredibly nuanced performances. Murray in particular is brilliant in his restraint, as on more than a few occasions he has the opportunity to revert to his standard goofy/funny guy act and doesn't.
This is one of the best films I have seen in the past year. I realize its not for everyone, some will consider it too slow or lacking in plot development, but they obviously will have missed the fact that sometimes a film can just be about how lost we feel in life.",1081814400,6,2526,4.625835189309577

I didn't know much about this film before watching it, and I spent the entire two hours stunned.  How could a screenwriter/director have such an understanding of people and how we operate?
This movie is about reality.  Period.  There is no rising action and climax in real life, no reveting fight scenes, no supermodels and no car chases.  If you can live with a movie that brings a reality close that Hollywood so often chases away - great.  If not, do not see this movie.

1504147,5,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a once popular American actor who now, in his middle-age, has found more acceptance and money from the people of Japan than from his own country. He arrives at a prestigious hotel in Tokyo and is given a royal treatment by his greeters and hosts. He is by himself in the land of the rising sun, his wife and kids having stayed behing in the US while he travels across the globe to do some liquor commercials. This Tokyo excursion will take about a week, and the monetary reward will be quite handsome. Contrast this with Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is at the same hotel tagging along with her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), as he does a multiple-day photo shoot. John is at work most of the time, and so Charlotte is by herself at the hotel, her attempts to keep from being bored proving fruitless. Both Bob and Charlotte are married people, but they are also very lonely people, and that is what ""Lost In Translation"" is all about.
Bob and Charlotte catch glimpses of one another at different places in the hotel, and finally decide to converse in earnest at the hotel bar. The entire plot of the film is about these two people getting to know each other. The story revolves around them. In fact, the story [is] them. Bob, in his early-fifties, is old enough to be Charlotte's dad, but that doesn't matter here. It's not about age. It's about the place, and the points that each of these people are at in their lives. Bob loves his children very much, but we do not sense he feels the same for his wife. We hear her on the phone when she calls him, and the same weary sentiment seems to flow from her voice. They are becoming a couple in name only. Then there's Charlotte & John. Both are young, and both are self-possessed. John is into his photography to the point of neglecting Charlotte. But we get the idea that even if gave her more attention, Charlotte might not really warm up to him. She has issues of her own. If Bob is going through a mid-life crisis, then Charlotte seems to be going through a young-life crisis.
""Lost In Translation"" is about being alone. Loneliness doesn't always mean that someone is physically separated from loved ones or from people in general. One can be alone in the middle of a crowded room. Such is the case with Bob & Charlotte. They're in Japan for a week. They don't really speak the language. Bob's wife is in the US, and Charlotte's husband is always at a photo shoot. The two lost souls find each other at the hotel, spend time with one another, and even sleep in the same bed together. But we know that while this is providing a small comfort for the time being, it is not a lasting solution to their problems. And we also understand that both Bob and Charlotte -- even if Bob's wife were in Tokyo with him, and John was by Charlotte's side all the time -- would still be lonely. Their life struggles lie deeper than what one person can provide, especially the persons they have chosen to settle down with.
This is probably Bill Murray's most understated performance, and it works brilliantly. He lets you in on Bob's emotions without betraying too much sentimentality. He conveys so much with just a smile, a frown, his body language, or simply the look in his eyes. He should get an Oscar nomination for this. Scarlett Johansson, who left me unimpressed in the movie ""Ghost World"" a few years ago, is excellent in her role here. She portrays Charlotte as a deep, troubled, yet intelligent young woman and, like her co-star, does it without overstating it. (...)Johansson is definitely an actress to watch for in the coming years.
Sofia Coppola has succeeded in creating a sliver of time & place with ""Lost In Translation"". It creates two of the most realistic characters to ever grace the cinema. You forget this is a movie, and start to really care for these people as though they really exist. And you get the feeling that this is a single, solitary moment that will be over with and then fondly remembered by the characters for a long time to come. This sweeps over you before the film is even over, much like when you are in the middle of a special occurence or event in your own life, and you stop and think about the fact that at one point - very soon - it will cease to be the present, and will instead become only a nostalgic memory.
And there you have ""Lost In Translation""",1081728000,3,4381,4.484355444305382

This movie had very little going on, I was just bored throughout the whole thing.  It's about a man, Bill Murray, who is on a business trip in Japan, trying to launch an alcohol brand that he is the spokesman for.  While on this trip, he meets a young woman, played by Scarlett Johanson, who is recently married and confused with what she wants out of life.  The two instantly connect and quickly become close friends.  Not much else goes on in this film.  It's boring and I was tempted to just turn it off and do something else, but I finished it anyway.

1504149,5,B00005JMJ4,"Different strokes for different folks. Some people like action and predictability, obvious and sudden plot twist, or everything tied up in a nice little package and all loose ends addressed by conclusion, with critical problems solved by impossible ""coincidences"", and/or humor that hits them over the head or jumps out at them. This movie has none of that. I must admit that I've enjoyed movies that were chock full of that stuff, but a lot of the time that stuff leaves me feeling cheated and let down and it starts  to get old after a while. This movie is really good and I like it better each time, but I'm sure I could burn it out (like I always do). The turning point and crucial moment for me (as if this movie really has one)... Well without spoiling it?..""more then this"" (you have to watch to understand).. the look on their faces, subtle, I know, but realistic, the looking away nervousness, that's how most people would be, me included.  I now can't get that song out of my head, even though that song is used in so many romantic moments in movies it's cliche, ( wow I found one where none were supposed to exist!), but the song is presented uniquely and it really fits this movie to a t.

1504153,4,B00005JMJ4,"As its title suggests, Sofia Coppola's Oscar-nominated film is the story of two lost souls who find one another in a foreign-speaking land (in this case, Tokyo).  Bob Harris is a world-famous action movie star from the 1970's who is in the city to appear in a commercial for a Japanese whiskey.  Charlotte is a young American woman in her twenties who has flown over from the states to be with her photographer husband while he does a shoot for a Japanese rock band.  Staying at the same luxury hotel, Bob and Charlotte eventually cross paths and find themselves irresistibly drawn to one another.
Bob and Charlotte are both introspective people, fully convinced that the lives they are leading are sterile, stifling and meaningless.  Bob, despite the obvious ""success"" he's enjoyed - fame, fortune and family - finds himself burned out and deeply dissatisfied with virtually every aspect of the life he's built for himself.  When we first meet Bob, he appears to be a man dragging himself through life, utterly unable even to feign the interest and enthusiasm that the people he meets expect of him.  In a brilliant performance, Bill Murray conveys this weary cynicism more through his body language and facial expressions than through words.  Indeed, it isn't until much later in the film - after he and Charlotte have found one another and have begun to communicate on an intimate level - that Bob is able to even halfway articulate what it is he is going though.  Charlotte, despite the fact that she is essentially just starting out in life, feels equally lost and rudderless, finding herself married to a man with whom she has little in common both intellectually and emotionally.  As Charlotte, Scarlett Johansson provides a poignant portrait of a woman who has so much to offer if only someone would be open enough to accept it.  Luckily for her, Bob comes along to do just that; unluckily, he is no more ""available"" than she is to make this relationship work.
As conceived by Coppola, ""Lost in Translation"" is more than just a tremendously sad evocation of unrequited love.  It is a heartrending tale about what happens when we not only marry the wrong person but end up meeting our soul mate when it is obviously too late to do anything about it.  As a writer, Coppola has opted to convey more of her meaning through silence and indirection than through dialogue and drama.  As a director, she often lingers for long periods of time over seemingly irrelevant details of daily life, creating a lyrical, poetic mood that enhances the melancholic tale she is telling.  The film sometimes feels more undernourished and less revelatory than it might have been had she allowed her characters to open up to each other in a more fully articulate way.  We sometimes feels as if Bob and Charlotte have so much more to say to each other - and to us - that we end up growing strangely impatient.  But then we just have to remind ourselves that that is the point Coppola is setting out to make here, that we can't always find the words to express the complexity of our feelings adequately and that sometimes we just have to find that special person who can understand us at our deepest level even without words.  That is what Bob and Charlotte do for one another as epitomized by that whispered bit of dialogue at the end that the audience is never intended to hear.  What Bob says to Charlotte we never know, but, whatever it is, it has meaning and significance only to her.
""Lost in Translation"" demands a certain level of patience from its audience.  But anyone who can appreciate a subtle, beautifully acted and exquisitely directed character study should find many subsurface rewards in this film.",1081641600,7,3699,4.742589703588144

1504155,4,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost In Translation"" is a pleasant interlude of a film, far removed from the typical blockbuster filled with violence and  and too much action with too little substance. This movie is character driven, with lots of atmosphere - but be warned, the movie is not long on plot. Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this wry, poignant comedy of kindred souls - middle-aged Bob Harris, (Bill Murray), and 25 year-old philosophy graduate Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) - as they wend their way through culture shock on a visit to Japan and commiserate with each other about their troubled marriages and life in general.

Bob Harris is an over-the-hill film star relegated to making whiskey commercials in Japan, where he is on a short stint when the movie opens. He apparently loathes himself for the work he is doing. His marriage has grown stale after 25 years and there does not appear to be a remedy for the situation. The telephone interaction between Bob and his wife is cold and distant, their only mutual interest is their children. Charlotte is a recent Yale graduate who majored in philosophy. With no job prospects on the horizon and a relatively short marriage which is going downhill fast, she finds herself very alone and lost. Charlotte is lovely, remarkably bright and totally ignored by her workaholic, famous photographer husband who inhabits a world more shallow than his wife can bear. Bob and Charlotte, unable to sleep, meet late one night in the hotel bar and strike up an unusual metaphysical conversation, of sorts. The two seem to understand and empathize with each other instantly. Palpable chemistry vibrates between them. These vibes would ordinarily be difficult to achieve with such a disparity in ages. However, Director Coppola does not let her characters off easily and go the typical May-December romance route. The couple share tremendous intimacy based on feelings not sex. They interact with unusual warmth, gentleness and a tremendous sense of sadness and yearning.
""Lost In Translation"" is also a comedy of cultures - our own western culture and Japan's. Culture clash and shock threaten to overwhelm Bob. The language, food, customs, pace of life alienate him more than he was before his plane landed in Tokyo. Together Bob and Charlotte find normalcy, a connection at a difficult point in time.
Murray gives an absolutely fantastic performance. He is so real, so natural as Bob Harris that it seems like he never worked from a script. Ms. Johansson is just perfect with her radiant innocence and wry humor. It is sheer pleasure to watch the two hang-out together. Ms. Coppola captures Tokyo from a foreigner's perspective - as Bob and Charlotte would view and experience the city - with its bright lights, towering skyscrapers, the Eastern take on Western culture, lots of action, movement and clamor.
This is a small gem of a movie that left me teary eyed, but not sentimentally so. And the ending is perfect.

1504156,1,B00005JMJ4,"It is a shame that elitists stick together so well.  It is because of their superior pride they lift up the work of their comrades when artistic value is lacking.  Lost In Translation is a movie that should have been a lost screenplay.  This movie is boring, stagnant, and just another sophisticated comedy created to help people with insomnia get some much needed rest.
Bill Murray has a few bright moments in this movie.  And there are but a few.  Most of this movie is comparable to watching ""The Real World"" on MTV, only even more of a disaster - so much wasted film, so much wasted time.
Scarlett Johansson is just a pretty face, and she had no business sharing the silver-screen with Bill Murray.  Her acting consisted of widening her eyes and stretching out on the bed or window seal; not much talent needed in this disaster of a comedy, drama, or whatever it was supposed to be.  I will check the cast of every movie I rent to make sure I never suffer through her work again.

1504257,1,B00005JMJ4,"This film obviously tries to make its point by making the viewer feel the same sense of tedium and muted, lightheaded state that the main characters (Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson) are feeling amidst the lights, tall buildings, lonely bars and crowded walkways of Japan; they're foreigners who haven't learned the Japanese language. But the question is, do you want to watch this? If you're a hopeless romantic, you may find treasure in the subtleties and rather monotone projection of this film, which never picks up -- and that seems to be the filmmaker's point. But even understanding the intent, doesn't make for an entertaining viewing. I tried to give it a chance, but ultimately, it makes for slow, tedious viewing and makes one wonder why it was nominated for any Oscars at all, nevermind winning one. (perhaps the Coppola name had something to do with it?) There are those moviegoers and critics who defend a film against critics saying naysayers don't understand the intended style (but that type of defense could be used to justify any movie, from Ed Wood films to the Ernest series). Onto another point, this movie commits the same faults many Hollywood movies do when it selects a ""foreign"" country as its locale -- it marginalizes the ""minority"" characters, making them all one-dimensional caricatures, while the usually white characters go trotting about as if the world is their oyster. The movie plays for cheap laughs on how Japanese people try to speak English -- but they shouldn't be speaking English at all -- it's the main characters who should be trying to speak Japanese, and not act like the stereotypical ""dirty, arrogant Americans."" There are at least a couple scenes in which Murray makes fun of Japanese people for not understanding English. Such scenes show the arrogance of many Americans, to think that others should cater to them, and bend to their culture. Hollywood constantly errs by taking what should be ""minority"" stories, and forcing white characters into the spotlight and shoving minorities to the sidelines, the background. (movies such as ""Last Samurai"" and ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" would have been much more interesting if they took the more interesting characters (the Japanese ones) and had them live, breathe, on their own without always being seen from the pov of the white character). But, as long as viewers keep on giving their money to such films, the mind-numbing trend won't end. And ""Lost in Translation"" is definitely mind-numbing.",1081641600,21,2491,5.048543689320389

#2 Bill Murry did a good job with a lame plot/dialoge.
#3 Excellent camera work.  Some beautiful imagery.

This movie is supposed to be so ""deep"" that us simpletons ""just don't get it"".  Well, we do ""get it"".  The problem is, there is no ""IT"".
I could make a more interesting movie by just filming a weekend in my hometown of Chicago.
It starts with me being at home having boring conversation with my wife that is too busy to pay attention to me.  I go downtown Chicago and stay in a fancy hotel.  I go golfing with some Japenese guys.  They say things like:  ""take a rice rong rook before u take shot""  ""ohh you leally lipped that drive""  etc....
Then I meet some cute young girl from out of town.  She is bored with her marriage and life too.  We start to hang out.  We drink at the bar, we smoke, and flirt.  Then one night we go out to a nightclub and sing Kareoke,I fall asleep in the cabride home.
When we get back to the hotel, I am awake and she is asleep.  I carry her up to her room and tuck her in.
Even though I want her, I sleep with some middle aged bimbo from the bar.  The next morning the young girl comes to my room to invite me to get Sushi.  She hears this other woman.  I regret what I did.  She is let down by my actions.
We go to a Sushi restaurant.  We are not happy with the selection, or the ""cook yourself"" meal.  We can barly hold a conversation over lunch.
Back at the hotel (while lying in a hottub)I call my wife, the phone conversation is boring. We have lost our ability to hold a conversation.  My kids are too busy playing to talk to me.  She hangs up on me without saying ""I love you""  I try to say it, but she hangs up before I can.
The last day I tell the young girl I have to go home.  We have an awkward good-bye because we are in a hotel lobby with many people around.  It is an awkward encounter, just like our entire weekend together.
I am driving in my taxi, I see her walking down the street.  I tell the cabbi to stop.  I catch up with her.  I want one last chance to say goodbye.  I Whisper something inaudible into her ear.  Give her a soft kiss on the cheek.  And we both go our own way!

One reader noted:  ""I loved 'Lost in Translation' in the theater and encouraged all of my friends to see it. Every single one who saw it on video was bored by the movie. To me, much of the humor and interest was in Bill Murray's expressions and reactions. Is there a possibility that this would be lost on the small screen?""

The good parts of this movie are based on Bill Murray's work and what the various entities of Sophia's father's high powered production team produce.
In other words, any of us could have made this movie with the resources Ms. Coppola had and it would have come out about the same.
Again not a terrible movie, but it is somewhat limp.  The story is not terribly compelling.  Sorry, it just isn't.  Mostly autobiographical evidently.
Some cheap shots are taken at the Japs' expense, especially in the language department.  The hooker scene for example.  The hooker keeps saying to Bill Murray ""lip it off"" meaning to say ""rip it off"" referring to her stockings.  What's creative or funny about that?  You can hear that kind of humor on any morning drive 'neck radio station.  The scene is tolerable due to Bill Murray's antics but that's all.

It takes courage in this ""bash-'em-between-the-eyes"" world to make a film that neither ""makes"" you think, nor lays everything right out in front of you - it's best to just watch and feel. Whether you ""get it"" or not (whatever that means) is irrelevant. Life itself is a random sequence of joys and sadnesses; as you get a little older, you figure out that it's really a journey without a destination. In this film, we are voyeurs getting to watch two very interesting, likeable and all too human people bump up against one another for a slice of time.
I haven't decided what my end will be yet. There are a lot of options. I do know, however, that this is a exceptional movie that, in a very stylish way, holds a mirror up in front of us. Highly recomended as a break from fantasyland with a couple of characters you'll like and root for.",1081036800,8,1351,4.586776859504132
1504375,5,B00005JMJ4,"I watched this film with my family and our neighbors.  I realized, again, that we are conditioned to expect a pace of input from film that ""entertains"" readily.  Everyone else in our little audience was bored, wanting something to ""happen"".  Complaints were frequent and the film was almost abandoned twice. The end brought amazed disappointment from some and outrage that critics liked it at all.
At first, like everyone else I mistook the slow pace for just ""boring"". After a while, though, (trying to ignore the complaints) I found myself drawn into the characters' world, relating to their respective plights, and as a consequence their mutual attraction.  Having done my fair share of business travel, I had a way to connect with the characters' plight: I've had numerous seemingly endless nights in strange hotel rooms.
In the end, I found it endearing in the manner of ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" - a beautiful film that connects in a subtle way if you give it a chance.  It's not for lots of viewers, in particular action film junkies or teenagers (unless you're a teenage boy with a yen for a strip joint scene and a beautiful woman in her underwear, pun intended).
I think I'll rent it if it's available on pay-tv on my next business trip.  It's a film best enjoyed quietly:  alone or with a lover snuggled by a fire with a bottle of wine - it'll pleasantly stretch two hours to a well-spent somthing more...",1081036800,6,1415,4.704453441295547
1504376,3,B00005JMJ4,"I was completely psyched to see Bill Murray as a Best Actor nominee for this year's Oscars and shamelessly rooted for him without having seen LOST IN TRANSLATION.
(Sean Penn, who'd been robbed by Nicolas Cage in LEAVING LAS VEGAS when Penn should have won for DEAD MAN WALKING, ended up winning over Murray).
When I finally saw LOST recently, I had to conclude that most of my friends who'd seen it were right: it looks great but nothing really happens.  Tokyo is a surreal, fascinating setting, especially when you realize that most Yanks have only seen the model version stomped by Godzilla all these years.  I probably would've liked this film more if I'd seen it BEFORE all the hype.

And I really wanted to like this movie too.  I personally loved Murray's first dramatic turn twenty years ago in THE RAZOR'S EDGE and I'd always felt that Sofia Coppola got a horrendously-harsh thrashing over GODFATHER III (I hated it but I also thought she was one of the few interesting things about it--come on, she LOOKED and ACTED more like Michael Corleone's daughter than Winona Ryder would have!).
I'm glad to see both Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray as the toasts of the town with this movie.

Bill Murray has been in other amazing movies such as Caddyshack, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and Groundhog Day, but this is my absolute favorite.  His performance of a depressed, out-of-his-prime movie star is deep and believable, and Ms. Scarlett Johansson is beautiful, and a wonderful actress.  Also you should definately get the soundtrack, whether you've seen the movie or not, because it has wonderful bands and artists like Peaches and the Jesus and Mary Chain (my favorite band).",1080950400,2,545,5.170454545454546
1504378,3,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation has many things going for it. The cinematography alone justifies the movie for me. The film is understated and quiet. If you have the attention span of a squirrel, then do not rent or buy this film. If you have any sense of patience, allowing a film to organically unfold, you will be rewarded.

Bill Murray is great, playing what I think is essentially himself. I think the core of the movie is his interaction with the Japanese people and culture, not the friendship/romance. The relationship with Scarlett Johanssen consists of them simply recreating together -- drinking, dancing, karaoke. Only in one scene is there any serious conversation between the two. Is there any *there* there? Not really. Johanssen doesn't have much to do, either, except mostly react to walking through Tokyo and Kyoto and staring out her hotel window.

Still, the film doesn't take any wrong turns or destroy its credibility. It is just a quiet, sweet meditative little movie. Probably the great reviews and excess hype will work against it now. People will expect too much.

And, I'm sorry, but the Japanese as depicted in this movie are just plain weird. From our point of view, inscrutable. So we have a good-natured and affectionate chuckle at their expense. Not having been to Japan, I cannot say how much the film exaggerates their strangeness. Even if this film is essentially accurate, I wonder if the Japanese themselves would be able to explain their behavior. The film does not even attempt to help us understand.",1080950400,,1527,4.910852713178294
1504379,4,B00005JMJ4,"As far as more recent films go, Lost in Translation sparks a love/hate relationship for me like no other.  Overall, I find the film rather enjoyable, but at the same time there is this duel nature surrounding it that I find to be both admirable and disdainable.
For me this duel nature lies at the heart of the task undertaken by Sofia Coppola.  On one hand the film is clearly something along the lines of the works of Godard, Antonioni and Kar Wai, a notion which Coppola herself didn't hide in her Oscar night acceptance speech.  And on the other hand, we also have the Hollywoodized (albeit Hollywood laced with the indie-spirit) nature of the film that is also very apparent throughout.  The characters, while often different from the norm, still have very stereotypical qualities, the overall image presented of Japan feels very Hollywoodized, and on top of it all there is the dry humor of Bill Murray.  What we are essentially presented with is a film that is both a detached/modernest/post-modernist/art house work along the lines of the earlier mentioned artists and an ""outside, yet still inside of Hollywood"" Hollywood film.
As a fan of the filmmakers she has been inspired by, I have a deep respect for Coppola in bringing forth that type of filmmaking to a mainstream audience.  Yet, with regard to the film's artistic merits, there is also a real problem in Hollywoodizing a style of filmmaking that at its essence is anti-Hollywood.  By making the film relatively mainstream, it can also be seen as going against the type of filmmaking it admires.  But to be fair, this same argument can be made against any film trying to blur the lines of Art cinema and Mainstream fare.  The difference with Lost in Translation (compared to say Punch-Drunk Love), is that Lost in Translation is SO influenced by such past works that it is impossible not to notice (for anyone familiar with such works going in) the mainstream/art cinema clash.  Instead of having its own voice that references such past works along the way, the film ultimately becomes a distortion of what has come before it.  Pop in In the Mood For Love,  L' Avventura or My Life to Live after watching Lost in Translation, and you'll get the point.
Again, although I'm rather critical about the overall nature of the film, I still find it very enjoyable.  It is a great exercise in creating a mood of detachment.  The main characters are detached from their lives, their surroundings and ultimately one another.  The wonderful cinematography also plays a big role here, as the camera positioning helps further the mood of detachment a number of times throughout the film.  And then obviously, there are the fabulous performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  At the end of the day the film has all the ingredients of a great work, but still seems to be missing that extra-something to make it truly special.
The film serves as a nice addition to the growing trend of films on the fringe of Hollywood that play on the traditional expectations of romantic comedies and romance in Hollywood film in general, right alongside Punch Drunk-Love and the recent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

Having lived in Japan as a young woman, I could completely understand Charlotte's sense of fragility in a foreign place when she felt equally foreign to herself.  Imagine graduating from any philosophy department only to realize that life isn't at all what you've been told, most people you meet couldn't care less who Aristotle was, you're criticized for being smart and labeled an elitist.  That actually sounds like many of the reviews this film has received on this site.  For the poetic, this film is breathtaking and sumptuous.

1504448,4,B00005JMJ4,"If you were to just happen upon this movie in the DVD rental shop and pick it up because the little blurb on the back intrigued you then at the end of this movie you would be pleasently surprised. However, unless you've been under a rock you've heard all the hype: Oscar nods for leads Scarlett Johansson & Bill Murray, and Writer/Director Sofia Coppola (who won the Oscar for best original screenplay). Thus overwhelmed or at least tainted by the hype you'll likely say to yourself or anyone else in the room at the end of this film: ""What the? That movie sucked!""
The Good: Scarlett Johansson & Bill Murray are fun to watch together. It's almost like watching the real Murray try to amuse himself in Tokyo. Coppola really does a good job handling the real star of the film: TOKYO! This film couldn't, wouldn't exist in any other setting. Murray & Johansson partake in a feww experiences truly unique to Tokyo and Coppola, who is on record as having spent A LOT of time there, captures it beautifully. From the crowded trains, to the Shibuya shopping, to the small restaurants & karaoke bars--Coppola gives Tokyo a feel of wonderment and warmth while maintaining the uneasiness any Westerner feels when they first visit Tokyo.
The Bad: This is not a Hollywood love story. No answered questions or traditional characters. I liked this about the film, but a lot of people I talked to found this to be too much for them. Yes the pace is slow, and I feel there should've been a bit more comedy with Murray and his fish out of water experiences with Japanese culture. Another thing is Coppola missed so much stuff about Tokyo and Japan! Having lived in Tokyo myself, I felt she only hit the tip of the iceberg. Most of this was because her main characters were rich and pampered entertainment types (something Coppola undoubtedly related to) so they missed out on a lot of ""normal"" Tokyo experiences that occur outside the 5 star hotel circle..
The DVD: Great behind the scenes footage from Coppola's then husband, Spike Jonze. All too brief ""interview"" w/ Murray & Coppola. Sadly no commentary from ANYONE! I'd love to hear some of Coppola's real life stories from her time in Tokyo as well as any similar experiences Murray & Johansson might've had in Japan with their characters. No deleted scenes. No outtakes.
Bottomline: If you don't buy into the hype and watch the film with an open mind you won't be dissapointed.",1080864000,,2417,4.676056338028169

I just feel that the movie lets the audience down  because it doesn't live up to it's initial promise to be an entertaining ride through Tokyo by two lonely people who are kindred spirits in spite of their many differences.

They even admitted in the DVD extras that alot of the non-core dialogue was unscripted for Bill Murray.  AND that was exactly why I felt the movie seemed so drawn out and senseless.  Some great things about the movie though,(and this is why I cannot give it a 1 star) is the great, expressive film work.  The photography really captured Japan through the eyes of a Foreign American. It is very reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai's film work...who incidently helped in making this film.  Coppola wants us to feel the boredom experienced by the two characters in the movie...unfortunately, we did.  If you love independent films and want a brilliant story that shows the ins and outs of an industrial asian city...PLEASE GO WATCH Wong Kar Wai's CHUNGKING EXPRESS.

1504581,3,B00005JMJ4,"There were times during the movie when I felt I was watching a travel show sponsored by the Japanese tourism board. The ""wowing"" Japanese urban background, elegant hotel sets and the overall exotic environs surely feel fresh. Together with little presence of American actors (besides of course the male and female leads), they also effortlessly transport the audience to the foreign territory and switch our mindset from one of an, well, audience to that of a tourist.
To complete the picture, the movie also lets the audience experience the cultural shocks, but in a rather derisive manner to the Japanese: A doctor who keeps speaking nothing but Japanese to an American patient; a translator who doesn't know enough English to translate to Bob (Bill Murray) properly; a prostitute who loses all her sex appeal by mis-pronouncing the word ""rip.""  (...)P>To be fair, all those depictions are not exaggerated in the movie as they do happen the same way in real-life Japan. But like the movie's exotic photography, the amusement derived from those jokes wears thin. Too thin to warrant their repeated usage in the movie.
Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a great performance. Their characters show their subtle appreciation of each other's company while one can feel their mutual feelings are ever closer to the boiling point. Sometimes it seems a mere touch or a lingering stare is what it needs to bring the feelings to the boil.
However, the over-reliance on the two actors and the set location renders the movie lacking its core support. This movie is mood-driven, which itself I have no problem with. In order to create the mood, the movie relies on a lot of short scenes. With little story, longer scenes might easily bore the audience, especially if the director lacks confidence. But also partly because of little story, the short scenes sometimes feel incoherent and they are linked together only by a weak thread of mood. This thread is weak in this movie because the mood often hinges on and is brought out by the location-specific factors such as the exotic scenery and foreign faces. As just mentioned, however, these things wear thin. (If you like mood pieces set in Japan, I'd recommend some really good Japanese made TV series in the mid 1990's (e.g., Long Vacation).)
Although I really like the ending scene - touching without sentimentality, the movie in the end feels empty and forgettable. One good thing is the director utilizes very well the location to craft the mood; one bad thing is the location is relied on much too heavily for the good of the film.",1080777600,,2584,4.899543378995434

I can definitely say I understand why people would dislike this film. However, I loved everything about it, from the stunning cinematography to the soundtrack (I'm a big Kevin Shields fan and have been waiting forever for him to do ANYTHING of consequence) to the multi-faceted performances of the actors. This is the defining role of Bill Murray's career, and those who dismiss it as simply ""Bill looking hang-dog and bored"" are missing volumes in my estimation, as are those who dismiss the story as too minimalist.

1504583,3,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray plays an ennui-stricken actor in the twilight of his career in his most subtle, nuanced, and engaging, ever: Nothing at all happens. He's in a bizzaro-world, filming a whiskey commercial for a Japanese director in Tokyo. His charcter, Bob Harris, is going through the motions, doing what he needs to do to get his multi-million dollar paycheck, but he's phoning it in. Every day, he goes to the set, does his 'thing' for a director he can't understand, then goes out and wanders about the city, bemused and detatched. Later, he calls home in the wee hours of the morning, to talk to his equally jaded and exhausted wife. It seems their relationship is rolling along on inertia - They obviously once cared for each other, but there's no energy or spark left, and their relationship is also being phoned in, figuratively as well as literally. Every day, the same routine.
Then, one evening, Bob Harris meets Scarlett Johansson, the lonely and neglected wife of a high-market photographer lost in the city and at her wits-end. The two tired, bored, worn-out souls connect in a solid but low-voltage bond, and they proceed to entertain each other in a platonic and detatched way. They share intimate confessions in the most superficial manner, and give each other cheap drunken laughs as they stumble through the alien backdrop of the city. Neither charcater is so much interested in each other, as they are in finding relief from their psychic pain. There's no passion in their relationship, no flare or future either. They simply stumble through their days together each propping up the other.
While this non-event, as described above, should be depressing and boring, it isn't. Instead, we get an intimate look into the lives of two people trapped by their choices, and without the strength or will to break away from their ruts. It's seductive in a PG-13 train-wreck sort of way: You can't look away, but at least you're spared the gore of a messy self-destruction. Instead, you kind of dream your way through the movie, entranced, but not quite sure why.

If you have seen the trailer you have seen all the funny parts, few they may be. If you are expecting a drama, there isn't any. Much has been made of Bill Murray's acting.

If you are the type who thinks the cliched long camera shot of the man sitting on the edge of his bed too depressed to get off it is the stuff of great theater, this is your movie. The characters could have ended their boredom easily. He could have quit cheating on his wife and gone home to play with the kids. She could get a job or volunteer for some worthwhile cause. No, they feel sorry for their sorry lives instead. Worse, they make us bored and that's the nepotistic director's fault. This is what Hollywood thinks is the stuff of life.

1504587,5,B00005JMJ4,"I was sceptical when I first heard that Sofia Coppola, the daughter of director Francis Ford Coppola, wanted to become a director. This seemed to be carrying even Hollywood nepotism way too far.
I'm happy to say that Sofia Coppola completely overcame my scepticism with her first film: ""The Virgin Suicides"". Now, with ""Lost in Translation"" she's made a film so full of charm and observation that I just can't wait to see what she's going to do next.
Although ""Lost in Translation"" stars Bill Murray, it's not one of his mainstream comedies but an - often humorous - offbeat love story, or friendship story, or lost soul story. It's the fact that you end up not quite sure which that is a major part of its charm.
Sofia Coppola's script is fairly minimalist, leaving plenty of room for Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson to develop their characters' relationships through looks, gestures, moments of silence. And then there are the added complications. Murray's character Bob Harris is facing a mid-life crisis. Johanssen's Charlotte is in her early to mid-twenties. Both are married.
Bob is a slightly over the hill actor who - he tells Charlotte - could be at home doing a play but is in Tokyo to do an ad for whisky for 2 million dollars. Charlotte is the wife of a fashion photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) who's in town to do a shoot. Charlotte's been married two years, and is beginning to think she doesn't really know who her husband is. Bob has been married for 25 years and it's a marriage that seems to exist for the sake of the children. During their cross world phone calls neither he nor his wife seem to be very open with one another emotionally.
Both characters are jet-lagged and suffering from insomnia. In the early hours of the morning they find themselves sitting next to one another in the hotel bar, and they begin to get to know one another, something that probably would not have happened had they not been adrift, strangers in a strange land.
And to them at least Tokyo is a strange land. Charlotte feels the alienation of the outsider. Bob's cultural collisions are somewhat more amusing. Some, most notably a session shooting photographs for the whiskey campaign, are ad-libbed by Murray and the Japanese cast. In another scene a Japanese prostitute sent to his room by his gracious hosts won't take no for an answer, and seems determined that he should lick her tights or lip her tights. It takes him a while to catch on.
Film-makers sometimes don't do so well when they are visiting another culture. Even a mostly observant director like Wim Wenders can find him or herself coming over as a cultural tourist, as Wenders did in ""Tokyo-Ga"".
Coppola and her cameraman Lance Accord, take us through a similar landscape, of pachinko parlours, video game arcades, and karaoke bars, but they're less overwhelmed with the environment and a bit more willing to draw satire from it. A Japanese character nicknamed Charlie Brown singing the Sex Pistols ""God Save the Queen"" in a karaoke bar, does - after all - have potentially humorous overtones. And the film's not any less satirical in its portrayal of many of the Western characters, including a Western lady jazz singer in the hotel bar, a Hollywood actress in Japan to promote an action movie in which she co-starred with Keanu Reeves, or even Bob himself. One encounter between Bob and the jazz singer, and its after-effects, are simultaneously stinging, funny and poignant.
Bob stays in Tokyo a few extra days to appear on an absurd TV chat show. Charlotte is left alone as her husband leaves town for a shoot. They begin to hang out together. They begin to realise that despite the age difference, and their different places in life they are experiencing very similar self-doubts. And they like each other. A lot. But where are they going to go with it? I'm not going to give much of that away, but it's an extremely sensitive portrayal of a budding relationship between what is - in some ways only - an odd couple.
Sofia Coppola's casting is inspired. The origin of the film was the city of Tokyo itself, which Coppola felt she wanted to put on screen, But once she'd decided that she began to look for characters and - from the beginning - had Murray in mind. In ""Lost in Translation"" Murray gives free rein to both his comic ability and his sensitivity.
Cast opposite him, Scarlet Johansson is about five years younger than the character she's playing. She's not yet even twenty, but she is already more than able to suggest a level of complexity far beyond her years.
Much the same statement also applies to director and screenwriter Sofia Coppola. Some have been sceptical about how someone so young could get into the head of a middle aged guy having a mid-life crisis. It doesn't surprise me so much. Coppola clearly possesses the art, insight and sensitivity to do it. And the only criticism I have about ""Lost in Translation"" is that it's all over way too fast.",1080691200,2,4945,4.711316397228638
1504675,5,B00005JMJ4,"Looking at one particularly bizarre review here I have to say that some people's way of looking at this charming little film is so very strange
First, the characters DO go out and explore and enjoy Tokyo and Japan, (Charlotte does anyway, Bob is mostly caught up in work) but they ARE carrying within them their own sadnesses and jetlag. This is not a hard thing to see in the film.
Neither are either of them remotely describable as ""ugly Americans"". They are puzzled by an alien culture, but neither of them puts that puzzlement down to the other culture's fault. Charlotte in particular would clearly like to know the place around her better. Shown particularly clearly in the Japanese wedding scene.
And they phone home to reawaken contacts with old friends, NOT to complain about anything that is happening to them in Tokyo. Charlotte is not upset with Tokyo. She's upset with her husband. Bob is dealing with strains within his marriage.
So yes, they meet, both jetlagged and sleepless in the middle of the night. The ranting reviewer has failed to point out that there are plenty of ""white faces"" around in the hotel but these two spot kindred spirits in each other. And they'd actually RATHER explore the city and the people together than hang out with any of the Americans.
And neither of them does refer to Tokyo as a ""miserable hell"". That's all in the writer's own ""mind"". Pinning all the marvellous complex relationship issues in this film down to a dislike of the ""alien"" is evidence of a chip on one's own shoulder. Some reviews are autobiography. Not about the movie at all.
The spectacle of a girl standing and watching her boyfriend playing a music video game is hardly specific to Japan (as anyone who has a PS2 will know). And yes, it does look weird, unless you are actually the one doing the playing. I've seen it in other places than Tokyo. These guitar, drum, dance, video games can be encountered in many parts of the world you know. In America we might also film people gazing mindlessly at a TV set to show the same kind of concentration (and to what end).
In the karaoke scene, no one implies that Bob or Charlotte can sing any better than the locals or show them how to do it. Everyone has fun with it in their own way. And if you HAVE ever experienced karaoke (which has - incidentally - again spread worldwide from Japan) you'll know it's not about the quality of the singing anyway but the enjoyment. To put this scene down as the ""arrogance"" of Americans shows that chip on the shoulder yet again. EVERYONE is enjoying themselves here, until Bob and Charlotte's jetlag finally does catch up with them.
The film makes fun of the weird things that the Japanese do, but it also makes fun of the weird things Americans do in a foreign country. And this apparently has gone right over more than one reviewer's head. And the humor in the movie is invariably affectionate. Unlike some of the bitter comments here on Amazon.
It isn't about being American, Japanese, or any other nationality, if I had written a review as full of idiocy and as self-revealing as that one, THEN I would have been so ashamed.",1080604800,13,3130,4.5910714285714285

1504680,4,B00005JMJ4,"My test of a ""great"" movie is one that has me thinking about it for days afterward.  This one does it in spades.  O.K., it is a thinking person's movie.  If you are into movies with plots that give themselves away after only five minutes and take every predictable turn and leave you feeling smugly satisfied after ninety minutes-sorry.  Try something else.  If you crave something deeper, more sublime and with as many layers of meaning as the walls of the Grand Canyon, give it a try.

I rented this video with few expectations and knowing little about it-other than looking forward to seeing a flick with Bill Murray that was set in Japan.  As a big fan of Bill Murray, I was only mildly disappointed to discover that he was doing a more serious part here, yet one not completely distanced from some of his previous roles.  Murray has the uncanny ability to be both funny and tragic--the perfect existential anti-hero.

Murray plays Bob Harris, the archetype of an aging film actor, who comes to Tokyo for a quick two million dollar paycheck to film a Suntori Whiskey ad campaign.  Overwhelmed by language and culture shock (though we suspect more is behind his alienation), Bob sits forlornly in his posh hotel room, unable to sleep and wanders into the hotel lobby.  There he nurses his Suntori scotch, listens to a mediocre American pop group and slinks away from some American businessmen who regale him with their admiration of his previous film work.

We see this movie through the lens of Bob.  Call it the ""ugly American-syndrome"" and get defensive, but Bob is hopelessly monolingual and monocultural. Like the dog that hears only ""blah-blah-blah, Rover"", Bob hears only a continuous stream of unintelligible Japanese, mangled R's/L's and abbreviated-but-useless translations from his helpful but oh-so-proper-and-politically-correct Japanese translator.

Enter Charlotte: the 20-ish wife of a clueless, ambitious and insensitive photographer husband in Tokyo for an assignment.  Stranded in the same posh hotel (also afflicted with jet-lag/insomnia) she eventually connects with Bob Harris.  Despite their age difference, the two develop a common bond within their disaffection and alienation.  The source of their angst comes from different sources, yet there is an attraction between them that fails to go the (anticipated) distance.

Bob's life, like the existential hero in Camus' ""The Stranger"", is without love, vitality, interest or inspiration.  Charlotte, young as she is, finds herself in the same dilemma.  She finds comfort and kinship with Bob.

There are moments of pure existential chaos such as when the two bored insomniacs explore the bright lights and strange sights and sounds of Tokyo in a drunken escapade.

This story unfolds in a crucible--the best of all story devices. A man and a woman, though decades apart in age, find kinship--and a form of love--in a strange land surrounded by a language and people they can barely comprehend.  The plot is minimalistic.  The timeline is one of only a few days.

This is a theme-driven experience that many will not appreciate.  Coppolla does an excellent job of creating a world of high strangeness and sublime beauty that will escape many.  Don't you miss it!",1080604800,9,3238,5.083333333333333

I think this is a lovely and delicate film that not everyone will love, but that only adolescents and boors could loathe with the kind of venom displayed in some of these reviews.  This is not a terribly romantic film, nor is it particularly a comedy.  It is bittersweet, the acting is superb, and the contrast between the human loneliness of the main characters and the congested, technocentric nightmare that is modern Tokyo works very well.  The best advice I got about it was to watch it with as few expectations as possible.  I did, and I loved it.  It was kept showing at an auditorium here in Spokane long after the first run was over, and long after it was available on DVD and VHS, and people continued to pay $6 and $7 to see it.

1504682,1,B00005JMJ4,"A film about two ugly Americans who find themselves ""stuck"" in a foreign land. Instead of exploring and enjoying the city and its surroundings, they stay cooped up in their hotel rooms, counting the hours till they day they will be released from this hell. Why? Because nobody speaks English there and they can't understand anything and they have no-one to talk to. So what can they do? They phone home and whine. And then they whine even more because the people at home got tired of listening to their whining and hung up on them.
So then what? So they sit in the lounge of the hotel and drink and mope. And mope, mope and mope. And then they spot each other. HEY! A white face! Woohoo! Oh, what relief! He'll understand English! Of course, he's White!
Groovy. So now they have someone to commiserate with. Oh, what joy it is to finally find someone who understands just how horrible it is to be stuck in this miserable hell for one whole week, where everything is Japanese. So they hatch their ""escape plan"". Escape what? All this -ugh!- un-American-ness!
So they ""escape"" out of their hotel prison. She decides to visit a friend. Oh, she has a friend there? And she only visits him as a last resort? What a lovely friend she makes! The two pass through a video arcade and she stares at the people there and the ""strange"" things they do. They sit spellbound in front of gambling machines. Weird! Some dance to the games, some play guitar. Weird! They then go karaoke-ing with a bunch of locals. They are all drunk and sing out of tune. Sigh... So what is a nice white girl to do but to take the mic herself and show these stupid Japanese people just what good singing really means!
There is always much to do and see in a foreign land. But all these two could see was how things did NOT work the way they're used to and people did NOT speak English the way they're used to. And they don't like that, oh no. How un-American this place is! If only Japan would be just like America! Then perhaps they could actually enjoy their time there!
The whole 1.5 hours is all about watching two very bored and miserable people. If Ms. Coppola was trying to convey boredom and misery, then well done. But can it be called entertainment? If you're bored on a Saturday night and are looking for an antidote, you'd do good to look elsewhere.
The film makes fun of the weird things that the Japanese do, like idolizing Hollywood movie stars (how weird!), their strange habits and social customs like always being polite and ever-smiling (ugh!), their asinine tv game shows (how could they do such stupid things on national tv?), their penchant for old reruns (what poor taste!), their inability to pronounce ""r"" (how un-American!), and their inability to speak English fluently (how totally un-American!), among other things.

I live in a culture that's not my own, and where people make fun of the differences all the time, from both sides of the divide.

1504774,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003)
The one thing a whole lot of reviews of this movie seemed to have in common was the word ""slow."" I'm not terribly sure why; I didn't find it slow at all (and I get bored easy when I've sat though two slow films in two days, as I had before turning this on).
The movie is the story of two American outcasts stuck in Tokyo, a fiftysomething actor (Bill Murray) in town to do an endorsement and the twentysomething wife (Best Actress Oscar nominee Scarlett Johansson) of a fashion photographer (The Gift's Giovanni Ribisi) in town to shoot a rock band. The two of them bond.
Which does, okay, sound slow. But Coppola keeps it moving by having the bonding bounce back and forth off the vagaries of Japanese culture and how incredibly different it is from American culture. Underneath all the marveling at the differences that they (and we) do, Coppola is subverting the Hollywood love story. Basically, there are two ways that people fall in love: the real way and the Hollywood way. Coppola gives us the former, and then further undermines the system as the movie progresses. Ultimately, the movie is both frustrating and fulfilling; none of the cliches one expects from a love story are at all in evidence, none of the shortcuts, none of the triggers we associate with what happens between a man and a woman in a Hollywood film.
Better than her debut, The Virgin Suicides. A fine film, worthy of the attention it has attracted. ****",1080518400,8,1472,4.64367816091954

However, I felt like the reviews were so good, the screenplay won an Oscar, and Bill Murray was nominated for one, so they had to be missing something.  To my dismay, the film was as unspectacular as I had been told.  I appreciate the film for conveying the feelings of isolation and loneliness one can get when traveling overseas on business.  I've experienced the same thing.  However, the film was far from perfect.  Where was the plot?  Someone needs to acquaint Sophia Coppola with Joseph Campbell.  Maybe I don't appreciate subtlety, but I don't even understand why Bill Murray was nominated for an Academy Award.  I can't believe he was so noticeably shocked when he didn't get the award.  He should have been shocked when he received the nomination!  Some people have called the film ""racist.""  I would not go that far, but it certainly made Tokyo seem like one boring place.  I didn't appreciate the lack of respect the film showed for another culture.  In fact, the film smacked of the American hegemony we're constantly criticized for by other countries.  You probably will not heed this warning, because I didn't either, but trust me that this is one film you can skip.",1080518400,6,1253,4.709677419354839
1504776,3,B00005JMJ4,"There were times during the movie when I felt I was watching a travel show sponsored by the Japanese tourism board. The ""wowing"" Japanese urban background, elegant hotel sets and the overall exotic environs surely feel fresh. Together with little presence of American actors (besides of course the male and female leads), they also effortlessly transport the audience to the foreign territory and switch our mindset from one of an, well, audience to that of a tourist.
To complete the picture, the movie also lets the audience experience the cultural shocks, but in a rather derisive manner to the Japanese: A doctor who keeps speaking Japanese in a totally vain hope that his politeness would make his American listener understand his diagnosis. Even a translator doesn't have enough mastery of English to get a commercial director's message across to her American client. A prostitute could not even properly say the word ""rip."" On a rare occasion when the movie does not seek to cultural-shock the audience with a language joke, a Japanese teenager is spotted reading a pornographic comic in the public.
To be fair, all those depictions are not exaggerated in the movie as they do happen the same way in real-life Japan. But like the exotic photography, the amusement derived from those jokes wears thin. Too thin to warrant their repeated usage in the movie.
Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a great performance. Their characters show their subtle appreciation of each other's company while their mutual feelings are ever closer to the boiling point. Sometimes it seems a mere touch or a lingering stare is what it needs to bring the feelings to the boil.
However, the over-reliance on the two actors and the set location renders the movie lacking its core support. This movie is mood-driven, which itself I have no problem with. In order to create the mood, the movie relies on a lot of short scenes. With little story, longer scenes would have plunged the movie into boredom. But also because of little story, the short scenes sometimes feel incoherent and they are linked together only by a weak thread of mood. This thread is weak in this movie because the mood is mainly generated by location-specific factors such as the exotic scenery and foreign faces. But as I have just mentioned, these things wear thin. If you like mood pieces set in Japan, I'd recommend some really good Japanese made TV series in mid 1990's (e.g., Long Vacation).
Although I really like the ending scene - touching without sentimentality, the movie in the end feels empty and in a sense, distant. One good thing is the director utilizes very well the location to craft the mood; one bad thing is the location is relied on much too heavily for the good of the film.",1080518400,,2759,4.859872611464968

  Despite the artistic visuals,it seemed they made a mockery of Japanese culture,rather than embracing it,as some others seem to think. The movie makes it seem as though all Japanese people run around being crazy and off the wall like Japanamation characters instead of real people.

1504779,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is a powerful and insightful film about one of the most fundamental of personal inquiries purpose. In other words, it is a movie about soul searching. Virtually all of us, at some point in time, will ponder our place in this world asking who we are, what we are supposed to do, and with whom we are supposed to be. Most individuals likely do not have to struggle with this question, either because they do not care, or because they simply occupy themselves with the routine and mundane fascinations of daily life, ignoring the deeper and more troubling nature of their existence. For others, however, the question of purpose in life can be a haunting, even paralyzing, burden. For those individuals who have personally felt this weight, it feels as if you are lost in the world. You do not know who you are, where you are going, or what you want. You feel melancholy, listless, and numb. You are not amused by the small trappings of daily life, and you want nothing more than to break out of the routine, and find your way. But, because finding the way is so difficult, you often drown yourself in sorrow and doubt.
Now, revealing these innermost thoughts is extremely difficult to do in a movie. At best, viewers are given small vignettes by a character's crying, their apathetic attitude, or, in rare instances, through dialogue where a character articulates their feelings in spoken word. ""Lost in Translation"" reveals the internal dilemma of the two main characters, who are both experiencing the feeling of being lost, by creating an analogy. The analogy is being in a foreign country, where the language, customs, mannerisms, and culture are vastly different from that which is familiar to you; for example, two Americans in modern-day Japan. A foreigner in such a position often does not understand where they are going, feel grossly out of place, and cannot take advantage of simple daily amusements. Stuck in such a situation, one might be tempted to simply stay in their hotel room, or lose themselves at the bar night after night. While not a perfect analogy, it is a visually intense way at revealing, albeit imperfectly, the feeling of an individual struggling with their place in the world.
""Lost in Translation"" avoids any deep philosophical analysis of this problem. It does not give an answer to the character's questions. It does not provide any hidden meaning of life. It does not attempt to make sense out of the confusion of life that can consume us and rightfully so. For those that struggle with the question of purpose, an answer is rarely presented. Some may have an epiphany, finding themselves in a moment of clarity. Others are not so lucky. The question of purpose is fundamental, and, as revealed by the characters in this film, is often a life long inquiry facing us at the beginning of life (Charlotte) or in the middle of well-traveled life (Bob).
What hope the film does provide is that we may find someone in life with whom we can share our experiences. This, in reality, is usually the best hope of all. We may never come to grasp with our struggle to find a place in the world. But by struggling together, it makes life bearable, and even, enjoyable. This is the relationship between Bob and Charlotte. It is not sexual. And it is not simply friendly. It is a deep connection a bond that allows them to overcome their melancholy, venturing through life together. Just as it is a far better experience for a foreigner to visit a foreign country with a friend. It is not that the two individuals combined have any better sense of direction or feel any less out of place. But they share the experience of being lost together relating and empathizing with each other, and depending on each other for support. A bond between two such lost souls is often more powerful than the disposable sexual relationships that permeate our culture today.
""Lost in Translation"" does not attempt to answer the questions faced by the characters. It simply shows them, as best as can be done through cinema. The film may frustrate the audience, being that it is slow and meandering at times, ambiguous, and unresolved. This reveals the brilliance of its direction. The audience will feel what the characters themselves feel. This is the entire intention of the film. It highlights the frustration and disappointment that some feel in this world. It shows that even though there may be someone in this world with whom we could connect - sometimes that connection is not possible.
Cinematically, this film is superb. Which is also very very funny. If you understand the purpose of the film, every aspect of direction contributes to the overall experience of sharing and understanding the sadness and confusion of the characters which is exactly what the two characters are doing for each other, sharing and understanding! Bill Murray does a fantastic portrayal of Bob. Only someone with his comedic skill could portray the sarcastic and subtle comedy of Bob's character. Scarlett Johansson is absolutely brilliant. She portrays the young, well-educated, but lost Charlotte without coming across as idealistic or portentous or philosophical-for-philosophy's sake. Her character is absolutely genuine, struggling with life even though she ostensibly has all those ""traditional"" indicia of happiness and success: a hansom husband, money, connection to fame, opportunities for world travel, and an Ivy League education.

Both Bob and Charlotte are bored out of their skulls, unfulfilled, and cross paths in downtown Tokyo.  This could have been the premise for a great romance, expect that director Sophia Coppola gives little reason to care about either the characters or their predicaments.  Not to mention that this movie drags and drags with not much in the way of a plot.  But ""Lost in Translation"" isn't a total bust.  Murray and Johansson do the best they can with the material they have to work with, and cinematographer Lance Acord deserves props for filming the city of Tokyo so beautifully.  And while this film does have its share of laughs (most of which, it must be said, are at the expense of the Japanese, who are made to look like fools), you can't help but notice that ""Lost in Translation"" is an average movie that's pretty empty at its core. It's not a disaster, but it's not exactly deserving of its praise.",1080432000,8,1235,4.742990654205608
1504828,4,B00005JMJ4,"For a good time, make it Lost in Translation time. This movie is quite good, and is most of all, different from all of the other movies that have come out this year.
 Writing the plot would be useless, as you can interpret it any way you want to. Sofia Coppola is obviously more gifted in directing than she is in acting, (see GODFATHER 3 bleacch.) and won the oscar for best original screenplay.
 I sincerely liked this movie and the characters in it, you can just watch this movie and fall asleep with your eyes open, transfixed on the tube.
 The bonus features really could have been a little more extensive, but they were okay, including interviews between Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola, amongst others.

1504829,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is a film I saw and fell in absolute love with. Every frame, every movement, every feeling it created in the busy, vibrant setting kept my eyes, and my heart, glued to the screen.
Indeed, ""Lost in Translation"" is a movie that succeeds by creating moods. In fact, I think that is why many who do not appreciate this movie fail to have enjoyed it: It's not so much about what is happening or where the story is going, but about the tensions and the aura that the film creates between its main characters' lives and how they develop that in the - to Americans, at least - foreign world of Japan.
Bill Murray and Scarlet J. do a phenomenal job of creating subtlety. Yes the movie is slow places, and yes it does not seem to be going anywhere easily identifiable. But that is the magic of it! The beauty in the story comes from the fact that Bill and Scarlet go off on a little journey that is totally separating them from the schedules, boundaries and relationships of the realities they live in.
I adored the gentleness with which the two leads interacted and how sporadically free some scenes were to just explore their own destinations. This is a movie that builds very slowly to a soft anticlimax. It doesn't matter what Murray whispers into Scarlet's ear after a lovingly painful embrace near the film's end. What matters is that for a little while they escaped together, and that for a little while, they left behind everything of consequence in their lives.
What makes some films beautiful are their plots. What makes others beautiful are their cinematography. This is a film that is made beautiful by its ambience; a movie made complete by its mood. It's a film that urges you to get inside the characters, and feel what they are feeling rather than simply watching what is happening on screen and waiting for it to be dramatic or funny.
Much like the recent (and brilliant, in another way) ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" some movies are meant to be appreciated on a level different from others.
Enjoying ""Lost in Translation"" is not a matter of intelligence or attention span: It's a matter of losing yourself in a feeling, and leaving your expectations at the door.",1080432000,14,2203,4.622448979591836

When I buy a DVD I want to be able to control every aspect of it and when a manufacturer impinges on the control of my own property it makes me annoyed and angry.

When I heard this movie might be a bit slow, I still didn't hesitate to rent it.  What a mistake!  This movie never got going.  It was one slow scene after another. There was little dialogue, little humor, and little of anything to be honest.
Also, the movie was easy to get ""lost"" in.  The Quiz show scene and many others were so brief it left one puzzled why they were even included.

1504834,3,B00005JMJ4,"I was disappointed in my first viewing of this film. I watched it on the same day as Whale Rider and Secondhand Lions, and frankly both are much better films.

However, after reading some of the wildly raving reviews, I went back and watched it again to see if I had somehow missed something. It did improve on the second viewing. I think I was put off by the pacing and general tone of the film on first viewing. I caught more of the subtle points the second time around, but still found that many important things passed too quickly (text of faxes, for example), while other things, such as the endless boredom scenes of Charlotte in her hotel room, went on way longer than needed to make the point.

I have to wonder if the film wasn't specifically designed to be vague in order to be some kind of Rorschach test for the person viewing it. It seems to me that we are actually told and shown very little about the two characters, and I think people are projecting a great deal when I read the reviews. For example, I didn't find the elevator scene where he was so much taller than everyone else to be racist so much as pointing out how he stood out as very different from everyone around him. It seemed to me to be about his isolation, not racism. (Maybe I'm projecting.........)

We know that the young woman, Charlotte, is in a marriage that no longer excites her. She hasn't ""found herself"" yet in life, and has reached a point of angst mixed with ennui that is not uncommon for someone her age as the hype fades and the bubble bursts. She is numb, bored, and in her own words, ""stuck."" Life isn't fun or easy any more.

The aging actor, Bob, is portrayed as probably having a drinking problem, although that isn't completely clear. We do know that he is feeling burned out, his marriage is no longer supportive or comfortable, and that he is no longer getting the film roles that made him popular. It is strongly hinted that he is past his prime and on the way down, but still big enough to get 2 million dollars for an ad campaign. He also is numb and withdrawn from life.

The thing I realized on the second viewing is that these are not extraordinary people. They are not witty Neil Simon intellectuals gamely facing the trials and tribulations of life in an endlessly entertaining manner. They are painfully ordinary and caught in the doldrums of life. She turns to him for wisdom about her situation, but only gets things like, ""I'm not worried about you,"" or ""You'll figure it out."" He has no wise words to make her life all better again.

He turns to her for some touch of youth and energy, and that doesn't work either. Both these people are stuck behind barriers of pain and boredom, and are neither secure nor open to honest emotional exchange. Their meetings are frequently awkward, and their conversations are usually halting and shallow. They do manage to grow because of each other, and that is good.

This movie isn't ""Harold and Maude,"" ""Same Time Next Year,"" or ""Razor's Edge,"" nor does it try to be. All the discussion about politics and Hollywood is neither here nor there. Did it deserve an Oscar? I don't honestly know. Oscars aren't exactly objective awards, and Sofia does have a famous Hollywood name. On the other hand, for a first movie, I don't think it is all that bad. It is different, gets its point across, and does tell a story, whether it is a story you want to hear or not. Making a movie is not at all easy, and I say Sofia did okay.

As far as the acting goes, it is easy to attack Johansson because her character is so ordinary, but have you considered how difficult it is to play ""ordinary?"" The actress who played the Hollywood starlet had a much easier job because her character was such a caricature. I think they all did okay. It was worth spending the time to see it twice and pick up what I missed. I doubt I would watch it a third time, though. I think all the hype did it more harm than good.

The thing that impressed me most was how well the film did at making me feel like an outsider in Japanese culture. I really got a sense of isolation and confusion with all the Japanese signs and no English words for reference, and the constant barrage of rapidly spoken Japanese. The film did a great job there. Watch it for that at least.

UPDATE: May 2011

After speaking with a younger colleague who absolutely loves this film, I have decided that there is probably a generational thing going on. He said it speaks very strongly to his life, and I value his opinion, so I am going to watch it a third time and see if I can detach from my point of view a bit and be more open to what appeals so much to his generation. (Always a good idea to listen and learn from those with whom we differ.) I will update this again after my next viewing.",1080259200,7,4787,4.361391694725028
1504939,1,B00005JMJ4,"This movie is way down there with ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.""  At least AKT knew it was stupid D movie and played that to the hilt.  Lost in Translation is just bad, bad, bad but it thinks it's a legitimate movie.  The Oooonly reason this script has ever seen the light of day is that it was directed by Ms. Coppola.  Her direction is OK, I guess, but most of the sceens are so lame, it is virtually impossible to rate the director.  Ditto with Bill Murray except he is the sole saving grace of this film.
Now I know Ms. Coppola also wrote it.  Were I she, I would not have advertised this too loudly because this is where the fault of this film CLEARY lies.  Everything the writer is responsible for in a movie (dialogue, sceen transition, whether the movie makes sense) SUCKS!  If anybody else wrote this movie, it would never have been financed and, if by some fluke it were, they would have been run out of Hollywood on a rail.  Ms. Coppola, of course, has a promising DIRECTING career because of her name but I believe that this movie has eliminated any possibility of her working as a writer (even in Hollywood, a name will only get you so far).
OK, if I have not been clear enough, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this film.  If you must watch it, rent it -- I assure you (even if you are the biggest Bill Murray fan who ever lived), you will NEVER want to watch the movie a second time.

1504941,1,B00005JMJ4,"Do you want to watch a film that goes nowhere?  If so, ""Lost in Translation"" is for you.
I rarely ever write negative reviews but I couldn't resist doing so for this one since I can honestly say that I have not been disappointed in a movie in a very long time as I have been with this film.
With all the hype and hoopla surrounding this film, I was expecting to see something decent and entertaining when I finally got around to renting it.  Thank goodness I only rented it. I pity those who actually bought the dvd and found out what a bore it really is.
I saw this film around Oscar time and actually got to watch 4 of the 5 nominated Best Picture films.  Of the 4, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" was by far the best and most brilliant, followed by ""Master & Commander,"" then ""Seabiscuit.""  I could barely sit through ""Lost in Translation.""  I talked to a handful of other people who have seen this and we all said the same thing: ""what a piece of overrated mush"" (except some of them were less kind than I was).  It truly is a film that goes nowhere.  Scarlett Johansson's character spends half the movie looking out the window in her Tokyo hotel smoking a cigarette. Bill Murray is either lying on his bed in the same Tokyo hotel or sitting in the bar and drinking himself silly.  They meet, hang out a few times then Bill Murray goes home.  That's about it.  Goodness knows Sofia Coppola wouldn't have won that Best Original Screenplay Oscar if not for her family name and Hollywood connections.  Her work with ""The Virgin Suicides"" was much better.
If you want a great Bill Murray movie, rent or buy ""Groundhog Day"" or ""Rushmore"" instead.  These films are entertaining and feature Bill Murray at his best.  And anyone, I mean 'anyone,' could have played Scarlett Johansson's role.  There was barely any acting involved there.  Though I am not a big fan of ""Cold Mountain,"" I think that film deserved the 5th spot for Best Picture much more than this movie.  In short, ""Cold Mountain"" was robbed.

The beauty of this movie lies in what doesn't happen.
Most people I know who didn't like this movie were expecting a Bill Murray ""comedy"".  It is, but not in the obvious ways.  It is so much more.  Murray and Scarlett Johansen were perfectly cast - I could not imagine any other actors playing these parts.",1080172800,11,625,4.904761904761905

Well indeed it turned out to be one of my favorites. Probably because the story line is much similar to one of my life stories. If you want to know how it feels when two complete strangers, with completely different backgrounds, in different stages of life (one just married, one married from 25 years) have the most complete understanding of each other, without necessarily physically penetrating into each-other, in a land of strangers and total non-understanding, then buy this movie and watch it over and over again. Arent we indeed lost in translation in our everyday life, whether in our most familiar neighborhood or in the most outlandish place on earth, and isn't this non-appropriative communication the two main characters have in the movie the best way to get to understand each-other?

1504946,3,B00005JMJ4,"My review title kind of sums up some of the obnoxious feeling that pervades this film. ""Wow, those Japanese sure are strange and quirky! Look at how different they are from us! It's amazing!"" This kind of attitude reminds me an agape-mouthed tourist whose never left Iowa abroad for the first time. The jokes that come from this may be funny for the Mad TV crowd, but left me with a sour feeling. ""Wow! It takes Bill Murray five minutes to figure out the hooker is saying 'Rip my stockings' because her 'r' sounds like an 'l.' Hilarious!"" Ugh.
This movie also trades heavily (I would say shamelessly) on the North American fascination with Tokyo and many things Japanese - the glaring light show of a Ginza, Shinjuku, or Roppongi, the vending machines that dispense panties advertised as ""used by schoolgirls"" for fetishists, the rapid transit rails that are a wonder to behold, the anime, manga, and video game culture, etc. The problem is, this movie views Tokyo, in my view, with the same kind of slack-jawed provincialism as a 14 year old who just finished watching Evangelion. Not good, especially when you're appealing to a crowd with a bit more select tastes.
Through this, we see a manipulation of Tokyo as fabulous backdrop that fills a gaping void in the movie - you can imagine this movie would completely fall flat in another locale. While setting is important, I personally don't feel it should overshadow the characters, *particularly* in a (should be) character-driven movie such as this. Okay, we've been treated to the Frommer's Guide to Tokyo onscreen. This is not why I came to see the movie. And certainly not for the type of humor all too prevalent throughout the movie. I half-expected Bill Murray to start stretching out his eyes and murmuring ""Me so solly!"" like some 50s comic.
Now, that said, once you get past all this, we come to an interesting character study, and this *is* worthwhile. But I'm not enthralled with the acting as our others, here's why. I felt Scarlett Johanssen was unconvincing in her role (casting an 18 year old, as she was at the time, in this role, was a bad idea in retrospect), and too many of her lines rang false.
Bill Murray, on the other hand, delivered a fine performance. Replace Johanssen, you still have a movie. Replace Bill Murray, you have nothing. If I have a fault with Murray here, it's that he may not be stretching himself that much in this role - this sardonic, humorously self-depricating man he plays is not that far off from many of his previous roles.
Now, with that said, the writing, while a bit sparse at times (coming from the school that's it is better to say too little than too much) is quite good, some of the best of 2003. Much of it does ring true, and it's nicely bittersweet without veering off too much into mawkishness. But as I stated above, some of the other grating elements of this film prevent me from rating it higher than three stars.",1080172800,,2929,4.634615384615385
1504947,2,B00005JMJ4,"so i just finished watching 'lost in translation' & for me, this movie can only be described as strange. i guess the point of the movie was to kind of show you what it's like to be in a foreign place and not understand anything. none of the Japanese spoken in the movie is subtitled. so the viewer is just as 'lost' as the characters. unfortunately, i have been to Japan so all of the things that were 'weird' to the characters were just Japanese to me. Though I don't speak much Japanese, I understood a few things here and there.
I think this movie portrays Americans pretty well tho in a way. Before I went to Japan (I went with a group in high school) we were warned about 'culture shock', I never felt this the entire time I was there. There were things that were different or unexpected and difficult at times with my weak Japanese, but at the same time I am a very accepting person and adaptable.
I have many different nationalities in my family including Black, Mexican, Japanese, and Filipino..so I kinda have to be accepting in order to get along with my family.
***if you haven't seen the movie, maybe don't read this****
The thing that kinda bugged me about the characters, was that they never even really tried to learn about the culture. I never saw them getting any books or trying to arrange a tour guide...all which would have been easy to do in a big city such as Tokyo. Bill Murray's character was a famous actor, he could have easily had a translator accompany him. I guess really now I think the movie wasn't about being lost in translation it was about being lost in life. These two people were lonely and lost and their connection was not only being White-Americans, it was also that they had problems in their marriages and weren't sure about their jobs. This movie is about two depressed people wallowing in their dispair.

And there are several parts throughout it which are hilarious (anything involving the whiskey commercials--especially the Roger Moore bit).  There were occasional parts in the movie that were slow and tedious, but frequently the acting smoothed over some of these slow parts.
Character development appears to be a strong point in Coppola's writing.  She did an incredible job with the two main characters, of course.

Johannsen is wise beyond her years, and I can't wait to see what she does next--great things are coming to this young woman.

The actors and director really capture the mood and pace of such an experience really well.  The shots of Japan are memorable.

So to say that this film can't be appreciated by the blunt, obvious taste of America is incorrect. I might also respond to those reviewers critical of American film making by saying that most of the great European directors, particularly the French New Wave, learned their craft by worshiping at the feet of the great American masters of the thirties and forties. Still, this film didn't do as well as, say, Bad Boys II. But then there is a good reason for that.
I remember reading that Francois Truffaunt was a huge fan of American gangster films, and in fact remarked more than once he considered them the only kind of film that interested him. How could this be? How could the director of such a  tender character study as Jules and Jim get off on James Cagney and George Raft (who were the big-budget ""action"" stars of their day)? The answer is simple: in an action film (yes, like Rambo, which was a very good film, by the way), the situations are heightened to an unusual level, thus characters in the film are themselves heightened and brought into sharp focus. Action films, in the most dramatic of terms, always have a very powerful conflict that needs resolution. What characters do under the extreme pressure, in action, is very interesting. Thus the experience of watching a good action film can be a very intense experience. You folks that turn up your noses at Rambo are missing plenty of great cinema.
What the zealous fans of this film don't get is this: it is very possible to dislike this film while at the same time ""getting"" every bloody, boring second of it. I mean, c'mon, somebody make me fall down laughing and call this film ""deep."" Lost in Translation was a dull, pretensious, childishly obvious piece of filmmaking. It was a long student film about (what a surprise) alienation. Oooh, I bet Sofia Coppola feels alienated herself, much like the young female lead she posed in endless ""lonely girl"" shots, don't you think? It was not a terrible movie; just immature. It didn't have what a great film like Die Hard had: a great conflict involving great characters. Bill Murray saved the day by adding his talents, which made it worth a rental. The last scene, which was the only gripping scene in the film, was very moving. It just took way too much celluloid to get there.
By the way, all you European lovers should go to Europe sometime, or anywhere in the world, for that matter. You know what they are watching? The current blockbusters from Hollywood. You know why? Because Hollywood learned long ago how to make a great movie that keeps butts in the seats. That's why. -Mykal Banta",1079913600,4,3418,4.584967320261438
1505120,1,B00005JMJ4,This movie is boring and stupid. Don't buy this DVD or rent the movie. I can tell you right here everything that happens in the movie so save your money. Bill Murray goes to Japan to film a commercial for a local whiskey. He is bored and meets the wife of a photographer who is also bored. They go together to a few stupid places and develop some platonic relationship. In the end he leaves to the U.S. and she stays in Japan. The end. Sucks huh? I can only say that this movie was done becuse of the Coppola name behind it. If some unknown would have written this junk they would have been laughed at.,1079913600,8,602,4.153846153846154
1505121,2,B00005JMJ4,"Warning: spoilers in this review!
This film's lead characters are adrift in a world so removed from their understanding and immediate concern that it seems almost imaginary.  With no obligations to attend to, they're suspended outside of time as well.  They meet, there's attraction, they hesitate to act on it, and for most of the movie they exist in a private world made almost solely of that tension.  Many of these reviews are spot-on in describing the whole experience (both for the characters and the audience) as dreamlike.
When the characters have to return to their lives at the end, you'd expect a catharsis of some kind, a revelation bringing a new level of understanding as they're waken from their dream.  Instead, Coppola gives the biggest cop-out, non-ending I've seen in years.  The ""speech the audience can't hear"" isn't poignant  -- it shows that director Coppola doesn't understand the characters she's created and doesn't have a clue what they actually would do in that situation.  It woke me, the audience, from the dream I was in -- and like many dreams and summer camp romances, it all seems far less deep, meaningful or important afterwards.
When Coppola leaves the audience to fill in whatever ending they want, that's not sublime or profound. It's the catchy jingle of a radio tune, where the lyrics give you the barest of frameworks so that you can fill the rest in from your own experiences and desires.  That can be entertaining, and it can mean a lot to you personally.  But that doesn't make it Great Art, and it doesn't make me shallow, unintelligent or insensitive for prefering movies with more substance and insight.",1079913600,3,1651,4.867857142857143

1505174,1,B00005JMJ4,"I'll start by saying that I did not like this movie. I was ready to stop watching it after 30 minutes but stuck it out to the end. Mostly, what I appreciate in a movie is good writing. Acting and cinema photography help but, in my opinion, cannot carry a movie. The nighttime photography was rather compelling but it made me want to visit Tokyo about as much as Potterville (which it rather resembled.)
This just might have made a good book, however. The thoughts and feelings of the three primary characters could have been presented (in a book) in such a way that the reader would have a different impression of them than was obtained from the movie: indifference. I neither liked nor disliked any of the main characters and felt no more involved in their lives than I would to the guy next to me at the airport after having listened to one end of his cell phone conversation.
This book/movie comparison works both ways. One of my all-time favorite books is ""Catcher in the Rye."" I have felt like I have known Holden Caufield all of my life. It would, however, make a horrible movie.
""Translation,"" (as a movie) in my opinion, had the makings of a good story. As I see it, it completely failed. I would be very interested to see it written as a novel.",1079827200,5,1253,4.428571428571429
1505175,5,B00005JMJ4,"I just will say I saw ""Lost in Translation"" on a plane from the United States, and it may be the only time in my life I have enjoyed watching a film in flying. I think Japan must be a very interesting place. It has a good mix of old and modern and I can see it will be very hard for an out sider to understand. I have been through a very same experience in US, and even I could follow the language.
You might think it not believable that a 20 year old girl could be so close with an older man but I have seen it happen all the time. Even many I have seen get married. Both of the main stars in this film were very good. I was so happy to see it win the Oscars when I was in Sacramento. I think the woman director is very charming and very talented. In India we do not have enough of this quiet sort of film. Even the films we see from America are not like this. I wish I could see more such films.",1079827200,8,897,3.751322751322751
1505176,2,B00005JMJ4,"I have enjoyed Bill Murray's work over the years.  I haven't always LOVED it, but he can always make me laugh.  My favorite is ""Ground Hog Day.""

I was interested in seeing this movie because of the things that I heard about Murray and this role.  I heard that he portrayed a character who was deep and that the movie was meaningful.  I was prepared for a bit of ""artsiness,"" and I was prepared to like Bill Murray if not the entire film.  I figured - with the Academy Award nomination and all - he must have broken new ground and stretched his acting range.

Well, I failed to enjoy the movie and found Bill Murray almost unrecognizable as a human being.  Perhaps the movie was about how shallow many people are.  Perhaps it was about how difficult it is to maintain a marriage, to get older, to be deeply bored, to have a mediocre career, to think you made a big mistake, to experience selfless love.  Maybe it is about how an unlikely, inconsequential meeting of two people can almost ruin two families.

Any of these seem like plausible themes.  However, there was almost no character development and almost no plot.  My guess is that the director had too little maturity and life experience to make a credible point through these characters in this situation.  As a result, I will never know what this movie was trying to do.  Furthermore, I'll probably forget all about the whole thing as soon as I hit the save button for this review.",1079827200,4,1441,4.4884615384615385
1505177,1,B00005JMJ4,This has to be the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. Overrated. I do like movies that delve in the human condition. But this movie was missing something. What it did was identify the problem but it did not attempt to solve the problem. That can work with some stories but not this one. Even the so called fun shots were really boring.  The photography was good. The acting was on target. And the story had potential. This movie is a waste of time.,1079827200,3,459,4.215909090909091
1505178,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is a beautiful movie about communication. How the differing history and mindset of people make it hard to understand and relate to eachother. Also, without a good way to communicate, people distance eachother and make caricatures of their environment. This is why the movie in the beginning emphasizes the problems the japanese director and Bob have without a proper interpreter. Why the young girl and Bob connected was because they were both in the same situation in life. The age difference didn't matter because they could communicate and understood eachother. I don't think the movie is boarderline racist. Coppola presents the asian people like that because that are our own prejudices. Illustrating the point even more. This is not a movie for everybody. If you are in for an emotional and thoughtful movie I would very much recommend it. It was one of the top 5 movies last year.",1079827200,8,892,4.953333333333333

There was a scene that was about 3 or 4 minutes long that showed nothing but Bill Murray's character trying to golf.  It wasn't funny, and had nothing to do with the movie.  Also, this movie makes the Japanese look like they're stupid, which is definitely not true.  It also portrays Japan as a boring, terrible place, which it is not.  My whole family hated this movie, and said that it was one of the most boring ones that they had ever seen.  I don't get why this movie was rated so high with critics, and why it got any nominations at all at any of the award shows.

1505180,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost In Translation is not a typical movie because it is essentially a foreign film driven by characters and not by plot or action.  This of course causes the massive negative reviews by most Americans who only like to see big explosions, fights, and naked women in films.
Bill Murray does a wonderful job with his character, almost underplaying it with subtle grace and humour.  The backsetting of Tokyo creates a surreal setting in which the viewer doesn't know what is going on.  The glimpses of a foreign culture with all of its oddities to us helps develop the character's motivations and problems.  Both of the principle performers really portray their characters' flaws which helps the viewer identify with them.  The ending was not quite what was expected, but it seemed very realistic.",1079827200,12,794,4.93984962406015

Bill Murray has done some great work; this movie does not add to his reputation. And, to be a famous director's daughter! We should all have such credentials. The idea that a director's reputation is tied to the quality of the work has always been somewhat suspect, but this movie really shows how corrupt the internal Hollywood processes are.",1079827200,12,720,4.958677685950414

1505284,5,B00005JMJ4,"I guess you have to be a little more mature and or wise beyond your years to appreciate a gem of a movie like Lost in Translation. Hollywood should take notice that movies like this with a smaller budget CAN bring in viewers and make you feeling cathartic when you leave the theatre. Which is what this movie did for me. Who needs car chases and explosions. I've seen them all. They all look the same. Making movies that touch the heartstrings and make you feeling good, very emotional, and thought-provoking are what movies should capture. Kudo's to Sofia Coppolla for succeeding in doing this. Keep it up girl. And the more realistic the story the better.
What happend to Bob Harris and Charlotte could happen to anybody with a void in their life and alone in a foreign city. I thought Bill Murray and Scarlett Joahnsen were superb. I think Scarlett Joahnsen is gorgeous and she had me beleiving throughout the film how her feelings were developing for the aging John. I can understand why she doesn't choose cheesy high school cheerleader-type roles with no substance. I predict she's going to be the next big Hollywood star in the near future. I also liked the musical score and subtleness of the story. Too bad not everybody can appreciate good movies like this. Sofia, if I can give you any advice, it's this.

It's definitely not the kind of movie you want to watch more than once.  Plus, Coppola apparently has a personal bias against attractive blondes.  The only people she portrays completely negatively in the movie seem to be blonde American women  -  first w/Kelly (Anna Faris) and then with the woman near the end who approaches Bob (Murray) in the hotel lobby as he's leaving to say she admires him and is immediately brushed off by him when he spots Charlotte (Johannson).

Most films, great as they are, never seem to escape the realm of 'Film' while I'm watching them. All the time I'm depicting  the details, questioning the script, reflecting on the camerawork etc.

The movie is sweet, soft, quietly funny, subtle and wholly original.  If you like unconventional characters in an unconventional place with an unconvntional story, then this is for you.

I'm not gushing about it but it feels right and good and real.  I don't think it was racist.  It was portraying what a real person would feel thrust into a place very different from his/her home.  I think that Coppola emphasized the cultural differences because she wanted the viewer to feel what the characters were feeling.  Culture shock!  Traveling to a country where you don't speak the language always feels like you're on another planet.  To a certain degree, every traveler brings with them a bit of racism, to be nice we call it ethnocentrism, but that doesn't make them a racist.
SPOILER AHEAD..............I also wanted to make a quick note about the ending that I know others have made as well.  The whole time that I was watching the movie, with the knowledge that it is rated R for some sexual content, I was concerned that I would have to see the pair take their relationship to a physical level.  I was so glad I was proved wrong.  The ending was absolutely perfect!
I love Bill Murray and I'm glad that he is finally getting recognition for his work.  Sometimes the look in his eyes in this movie made me feel exactly what his was trying to convey and thats rare in an actor.  I never knew what all the hype about Scarlett Johannsen was about and I never thought that I would like her, but she was incredible.  I saw parts of myself in her and completely identified with her.  I especially loved the shots of her wandering around sightseeing by herself.  I could almost see myself doing the same thing.  She has the ability to be normal and gorgeous at the same time.

I've watched at least two movies a week for the past thirty years, not counting reruns on TV. That's a lot of movies, well over 3,000, but I still love them even though we do go through periods when everything that comes to the movie-house is garbage. Last year was a good year. One of the best in the past decade. And ""Lost in Translation"" was one of the best movies. (I also thought ""Big Fish"" was brilliant and Tim Burton's best movie so far.)
Watching so many movies I can't tell you how sick I get of coming out of the theater knowing that I've just been treated like a lobotomized dummy by film makers who think all movie goers are thirteen year old boys with too many hormones who like to see things blow up.
Sophia Coppola, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson treated me like an adult with enough brain to care about real people making a connection in a strange context. I can hardly praise this movie enough. The low budget does not show, it just serves to make you focus on human details. But then it is always cheaper to make a film about people than about special effects.
I'm bored with movies without characters. I love this one because it had characters and I could care about them. And to those who didn't find it funny, you probably wouldn't like Buster Keaton either. Murray's humor is so deadpan it had me cracking up. Not all humor has to be telegraphed.

I don't understand why this movie got so much acclaim during Oscar time.  I have only seen one other movie directed by Sofia Coppola which was ""The Virgin Suicides.""

It is random. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In one scene the main characters are in a bar, the next they are in a strip club, next you'll see them fleeing a gun fight from another bar, then you see Bill Murray golfing. There is no plot as far as I can see. It is about two ""alone"" people in Japan who have nothing to do but be depressed, so they find eachother and go to different places.

For people who say its quirky, your wrong.  Quirky films don't get nomanations for best picture, there is a difference.  See this movie!",1079395200,9,711,4.2388059701492535
1505450,5,B00005JMJ4,"Although ""Lost in Translation"" stars Bill Murray, it's not one of his mainstream comedies but an - often humorous - offbeat love story, or friendship story, or lost soul story. It's the fact that you end up not quite sure which that is a major part of its charm.
Longtime filmgoers may remember Richard Linklater's 1995 ""Before Sunrise"", which starred Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as an American man and a French girl who meet and develop a romantic relationship over the space of a few hours while he's backpacking through Europe. It's a film that I quite liked. But ""Lost in Translation"" is not only a similar movie. It's a better and more complex one. ""Before Dawn"" was sometimes a little too in love with its own wordiness.
Sofia Coppola's script for ""Lost in Translation"" is fairly minimalist, leaving plenty of room for Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson to develop their relationship through a look, a gesture, a moment of silence. And then there are the added complications. Murray's character Bob Harris is facing a mid-life crisis. Johanssen's Charlotte is in her early to mid-twenties. Both are married.
Bob is a slightly over the hill actor who - he tells Charlotte - could be at home doing a play but is in Tokyo to do an ad for whisky for 2 million dollars. Charlotte is the wife of a fashion photographer, played by Giovanni Ribisi who's in town to do a shoot. Charlotte's been married two years, and is beginning to think she doesn't really know who her husband is. Bob has been married for 25 years and it's a marriage that seems to exist for the sake of the children. During their cross world phone calls neither he nor his wife seem to be very open with one another emotionally.
Both characters are jet-lagged and suffering from insomnia. In the early hours of the morning they find themselves sitting next to one another in the hotel bar, and they begin to get to know one another, something that probably would not have happened had they not been adrift, strangers in a strange land.
And to them at least Tokyo is a strange land. Charlotte feels the alienation of the outsider. Bob's cultural collisions are - as one would expect when Bill Murray is playing the character - somewhat more amusing. Some of them, notably a session shooting photographs for the whiskey campaign, are ad-libbed by Murray and the Japanese cast. In another scene a Japanese prostitute sent to his room by his gracious hosts won't take no for an answer, and seems determined that he should lick her tights or lip her tights. It takes him a while to catch on.
A Japanese character nicknamed Charlie Brown singing the Sex Pistols ""God Save the Queen"" in a karaoke bar, does - after all -have potentially humorous overtones. And the film's not any less satirical in its portrayal of many of the Western characters, including a Western lady jazz singer in the hotel bar, a Hollywood actress in Japan to promote an action movie in which she co-starred with Keanu Reeves, or even Bob himself. One encounter between Bob and the jazz singer, and its after-effects, are simultaneously stinging, funny and poignant.
Bob stays in Tokyo a few extra days to appear on an absurd TV chat show. Charlotte is left alone as her husband leaves town for a shoot. They begin to hang out together. They begin to realise that despite the age difference, and their different places in life they are experiencing very similar self-doubts. And they like each other. A lot. But where are they going to go with it? I'm not going to give much of that away, but it's an extremely sensitive portrayal of a budding relationship between what is - in some ways only - an odd couple.",1079395200,2,3644,4.651162790697675
1505451,5,B00005JMJ4,"Translation is about more than language. It's also about how we interpret each other's signs and behavior. It's so easy to be guarded in today's world. Charlotte would have every reason to put up a wall that would lock Bob Harris out. (Anyone notice that this fillm completely gives the lie to ""When Harry Met Sally""?)
In ""Lost in Translation"" two people learn how to interpret each other, and learn how to let the walls down. That's a rare and beautiful thing.
I like what Tokyo brings to the movie. Set it in Paris or Venice, and it's just a hackneyed romantic background. A lesser director could even have turned Tokyo into a romantic background too. Instead Sofia Coppola makes it another world.
I don't want to say whether Bill Murray or Scarlett Johansson gave good performances. I just want to believe in sad Charlotte and disillusioned Bob. And they live in these bodies.
I wondered how such an honest film could get made. Cynics said it was because of who Sofia Coppola's father was. And then I read that in its first three weekends in US cinemas alone it earned MORE than it had cost to make it. That doesn't count the weekdays in between, and all the days it's been on since, and all the video sales. The good news is such an honest film got made because so many people wanted to see it. And the investors made a lot of money. Sadly that's always Hollywood's bottom line.
It's nice to see the David of true and honest film-making stand-up to the Goliath of mindless action movies and stories about sex-crazed teens and pies. I am so happy this film did so well, and that as many people love it as much as I do. Maybe, that way, we'll see more like it.",1079395200,12,1662,4.434640522875817

1505457,5,B00005JMJ4,"There are 966 user reviews at the time that I write this, so I realize the futility of adding yet another voice to the chaos that will probably never be completely sorted through completely by anyone thinking about purchasing this movie, but on the off chance that someone will read this, here's my opinion anyway.
I liked this movie. A lot.  Lost in Translation seems to run the gamut of reactions to it though.  Some people love it, some people hate it, others remain bored and indifferent.  Here's a brief rundown of why I love it
1.  Coppola's camera.  The cinematography is beautiful, the camera tech reflects and amplifies the story, and Tokyo is allowed to shine.
2.  The writing.  Dialogue is well-crafted and the actions are significant.  Also, though some say it's a boring movie, I liked the pacing.
3.  Coppola's character direction.  The nuances of the performances and what's said and what's not said, these things come together to create vivid character studies.  And of course, to go with this...
4.  The actors.  Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, and Giovanni Ribisi are all very good and convincing.  The interactions between these characters almost become separate entities in themselves.
5.  All that pretentious conceptual stuff.  Hey, I don't think it's a pretentious film, but others seem to think so.  I actually thought this movie hit the mark it was aiming for, in tone and in a consistent portrayal of themes.  For me, this is about alienation and the power and weakness of words.  And it's a love story.  Actually, speaking of that, my last and most specific point...
6.  The romance avoids cliches.  Sure, a lesser director with less imagination might've pandered to the audience and these two leads would eventually end up in the sack in a Lolita-esque conclusion, but I think it's more believable the way it all actually works out, and there's more emotional impact in the end in my opinion.  I applaud Coppola's choice to keep this affair subdued.  Even though Bob and Charlotte's relationship seems to be sexual at some deep level, it's not about sex.  It's about how these characters find each other and relate to each other so fantastically, in words but more importantly in ways words can't convey.
that's it for me.",1079222400,13,2251,4.860526315789474
1505510,5,B00005JMJ4,"Reading all these harsh reviews, I found that this film is a mirror for people and their ignorance, or intelligence.
a) How is this a movie without a plot??  Thats just INSANE! Two people are separated from normal life.  Two people are cloistered and alone, even in their relationships with spouses.  The two people slowly meet, again and again.  Two people begin to share their lonely lives together.  Two people grow fond.  two people love, but don't take advantage. Two people seperate, having shared humor, love, regret, lonliness, Tokyo without having fully communicating their love.  They meet one last time and open up to each other.  Thats not a PLOT??
b) This film seems to give everyone some dumb view point to bash someone in their lives, basically displaying they, the reviewers, are petty, gross, evil people at heart.  How is this a movie that gives rise to the ability to bash artsy people, Americans, Japanese, President Bush or anyone?  Are you people insane??  The people who like this movie LIKED it, it wasn't a LIFESTYLE choice.  It was something that appealed.  As for the German guy bashing Americans, thats just rude and dumb.  I come from German parents and I understand how sick some German thinking is, but good lord, keep it to your own ignorant self.  This is a film that could be about anyone anywhere.
c) Rascist?  How is this film rascist?  RACIAL maybe....but more culturally skewed and playful then RASCIST.  Are the Japanese even a race?  Whats is this about?  They had fun with cultural differences.  I didn't see 'wing wong, slanty eyes!' jokes, or even worse 'Me Japranese! Me brohm Peraw Hawboaawwww'....come on tendloins, get a life.
d) Not funny?  Sure, this film isn't what you call a pure American cinema COMEDY, but there is so much light humor going on with the characters and situations that it does have a lot of humor within this well rounded film.  It is a drama, romance, comedy film, but its just a really good film.  People must go to this film expecting  'HEY! WATCH ME PULL A GOPHER OUTTA MY HOLE!', Bill Murray slamming his genitals in doors, Asian sex jokes, people pratfalling on asian pears, wild eyed goofy takes at the camera, silly outfits, and the obligatory nude scene with the 16 year old being discovered by his parents and hiding his manhood in a pie.  This just isn't that.  How can you even expect that seeing any of the previews??  People are so ignorant.  Look at the poster, look at the cover, look at the previews!  Where is this a 'genitals in pie' story??
e) 'Emperor's New Clothes'??  The only person standing out here is the reviewer, showing off as a brazen dunce.  While, I expect, people wanted missiles whizzing around, car chases with funny faces and one liners right out of Nickelodeon cartoons, maybe some evil boss Murray and Johannsen must fight to prove their love, this just ISN'T that.  Some of my favorite movies of all time are 'Casablanca', 'Evil Dead 2', 'M' and 'Death Wish 3'...I can enjoy anything well done in any genre by anyone and I understand most people can't.  But to give this film 1 star???  What is wrong with you.  It is beautifully filmed, has some really excellent sequences, makes sense, has a plot, combines a lot of dramatic and humorous elements in writing.  People don't even rate some of the all time HORRIBLE movies that were filmed on 16 mm with total lack of story at 1 star.....
What this film really shows is how ridiculous 95 percent of the reviewers are.  Naturally, I am not one of them.",1079222400,18,3509,4.673202614379085

1505512,4,B00005JMJ4,"This film is surprising, surprisingly slow, surprisingly uneventful. Nothing happens, or rather no action whatsoever happens in the whole film. Don't be a middle-aged or advanced middle-aged man staying in Japan for a few professional days. This will lead to some boring experience. The poor man is taken care of by his boss and is provided with some female entertainment who titillates him and tries to make him rape her : phantasms are the target and tool of the  professional  woman. But then that poor man enables us to review the fate of this type of men : they are travelling for their professions, they are away from their families most of the time, they are the distant husbands - which satisfies the wife who retreated into motherhood -, they frustrate their children and develop with them a relation based on absence and estrangement, etc. They happen here and there to let themselves get involved in the hunt of some women (the women are the hunters), in this case an American singer in the hotel. They are also moved by some younger women who are also estranged from their husbands who are around but working on location as photographers or anything else. And that's the main interest of the film. The age gap is so important that there will be no passionate sexual exploration, but rather a highly sophisticated even cultured exploration of emotions and nothing but emotions. Ms Coppola goes against the grain that considers that these older men are predators and that these younger women are willing explorers of the human jungle. The passion, if indeed it is a passion, that develops here is purely platonic and shows that the man, as well as the woman, are looking for companionship and soul or spiritual exchange. The depth of this relation is shown in the accidental final goodbye scene. The man is playing father more than lover to the woman, and incest, remember, is rejected by all sane men and women. Temptation maybe, but a fruit that will never be plucked. This vision is definitely feminine and it shows that the younger woman might be led into yielding, maybe. She might not resist if the man were insistant. But Ms Coppola imagines a man who is not insistant and projects her desire or her knowledge, who knows which, to meet such older men, father figures that would not be insistant and try to become lovers. A fine film both about the real world and about the world Ms Coppola would like to meet. A crisscrossing patchwork of reality and dream, and you will never find out where each one starts and each one ends.

1505513,5,B00005JMJ4,"If you like this sort of thing, you'll enjoy the movie.  Even if you have vague, faint sympathy for this sort of thing, lost in translation is worth your while.  If you enjoy clear channel radio stations and Tom Clancy novels... well... um, you can always rent The Fast and the Furious 2 again, I guess.
Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen feel lonesome.  Their careers, lovers, and even immediate surroundings feel foreign to them.  That this is set in Tokyo really just underscores the alienation they feel toward their lives in general.  This is made even better by not using Japanese subtitles, when it's spoken so much throughout the movie.  Also, discounting Bill and Scarlett's chars, every single American in the movie are deplorable phonies, and they stick out even moreso in the sea of Japanese.
Sofia has documented alienation in its purest form, then swept it away with sweet love.  That's really the point of the movie, and if you've never experienced anything like that, you'll likely think Lost is pointless.  Oh well.",1079136000,,1031,4.885057471264368
1505514,5,B00005JMJ4,"I was dreading seeing ""Lost in Translation"". I'd heard a lot about it, and had somehow got the impression it was a very ""worthy"" movie, something you felt you ought to see.
To my huge surprise and delight I loved it. I wanted it to be longer. I wanted to spend a day with these people. It's true it's an idiosyncratic movie, and that's great for those of us who are sick of seeing the same movie in different clothes a thousand times. Or who are sick of movies only about special effects.
I missed Coppola's ""Virgin Suicides"" but after seeing this will certainly search it out. She has a wonderful fresh vision. And the strength of mind to put it on film.
In terms of character, although not of career, Bill Murray seems to be playing himself, a man who uses humor as a way to make the world more amenable. That's just what Charlotte - Scarlett Johansson - needs. Her husband is a star-struck dork and the outlook for their marriage isn't good.
Beautifully filmed, sensitively put together. With such a strong individual vision that you'll either love it or hate it. Not many come down in the middle.
And don't listen TOO much to the complaints about the previews on the DVD.  Granted, it's a bit annoying, but they DO superimpose a sign saying you can fast-forward through the previews. It took all of two seconds on my machine.

1505516,5,B00005JMJ4,"First of all, I will admit that this film is not for everyone. And people have questioned the ""lack of no plot"" (as some would say), and the ""weird sexual relationship"" between the two protagonists. But this film, is like having one of those sernedity moments, of just exploring you mind on your life, as you stare up into space. But I think that people will get disappointed, that with all the ""critics"" hype, they expect a clear beginning,middle, and end. And, I think that if you never felt like you never had a connection with a person you just met, than perhaps you won't understand the relationship between Bob and Charlotte. There relationship is nothing sexual, but you can tell that, they were made for each other. There soul-mates that share a connection. And Tokyo acts as a background to all these, giving the feeling of loss, and isolation from their home(America). But there relationship contents full of unqiue honest moments, in which they use each other to understand themselves better. Its kinda like one of those close intimate friendships, where you find a instant bond with each other, as well as learning from each other, and than parting. Is not sad, its bittersweet and leaves the sense of moving forward in time.
I must say that this film, is gorgeous in showing the beauty of the city, and Sofia Coppola, has done it again!! I love the Virgin Suicides, and I must say that Lost in Translation shows more of the depth, and brillance that is contended in Sofia.
I don't recommend this movie to others, but I must say that I (a 16 year old) loved the feeling of the film. And in particualr, I must give thanks for Sofia, for writting/directing this poigant little gem ! Keep up the brilliant work !!",1079136000,8,1722,4.630718954248366

1505590,5,B00005JMJ4,"Continuing to be entrenched in an existentialist stronghold, Sofia Coppola presents us with a great script coupled with impeccable acting by Bill Murray, splendid photography and an enviable soundtrack to go with it all: a perfect combination, if you ask me!
The story deservedly earned Ms. Coppola (who was also the first American woman ever nominated for the Academy Award as a Director) an Oscar for best original script in 2004. The story takes place in Tokyo, a strange culture that results almost extraterrestrial at first to the legendary actor Bob Harris (played by Murray), now reduced to touring exotic locations and venues and doing luxury drink commercials, and young and beautiful Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson). Both are stranded in this faraway land: he (over 50), being away from his family in the US, and undergoing a middle age crisis; and she (just over 20, fresh out of school and not being married for too long), also ""distant"" (yet physically close) from her husband who she's accompanying in Tokyo on a business trip, while she tries to figure out what to make of her life, after four years of Philosophy in college. The two, in the midst of their own particular crises, connect and a unique chemistry builds up between them that will capture you and leave you thinking, regardless of which of their ages you're closer to.
Murray's acting, with a very subtle sense of humor, takes the story to a level that not many other actors could, balancing his internal conflicts with the ability to laugh at himself and life at large, when things don't turn out as he'd like them to. A hilarious moment for history in this movie is his struggle when dealing with his wife's suggestion that they pick burgundy for the color of a new carpet back home, while in front of a whole group of red-looking samples, not having a clue which one she means as THE burgundy sample. Impossible not to crack up, since most men will not be able to tell tones of red appart from each other (and even if we did, most of the time we don't really care what color things are, anyway).
Photography and music bring an added art element to the movie that is impossible to overlook. The lights and visual elements in Tokyo help capture some breathtaking moments that transport the user to places remote for most of us, in a very surreal way. The music helps build atmospheres in ways that approach perfection: it's a great continuation of the effect Ms. Coppola accomplished in Virgin Suicides, a movie that French duo Air masterfully scored. In 'Lost in Translation', Air participates once again, this time alongside Kevin Shields (My Bloddy Valentine), Death in Vegas, Jesus & Mary Chain and a handful of others to assemble a powerful and eclectic soundtrack that provides an unforgettable musical frame to the rest of the art of the movie.
Without a doubt, among the best movies of 2003.",1079049600,8,2887,4.776
1505591,5,B00005JMJ4,"I'm so sad that there's such apathy and ignorance directed at this absolutely gorgeous cinematic gem.  I rarely care for characters as I did for Charlotte and Bob Harris.
Bill Murray was almost always on the verge of tears during his solitary moments or moments with Japanese PR people, but his soul glowed with life when Charlotte was with him.  I couldn't believe I was watching such a subtly beautiful performance from Bill Murray--even though I do think he's a damn good actor and I've always loved him and most of his movies.
Two ""soulmates"" found each other in a strange sea of people they cannot relate to whether it's the people of Tokyo, their spouses, or their life, they found something magical in each other.  If you've ever encountered someone special in your life, you'll most likely relate to the bond you feel with someone in the face of adversity or loneliness.
That's why I can't believe the absolutely dopey reviews to this movie about boredom.  Can't people watch a movie without the couple jumping into bed immediately or the bangs of explosions?  I enjoy those types of movies too, but this movie is about relating to each other, intimacy (real intimacy, not sex), and some damn funny humor thanks to aforementioned Bill.  Perhaps the views expressed here are indicative of the sad state of our society and I find *that* depressing.  I also find the negative, non-constructive reviews boring.
The movie, however, I find exhilirating and life-affirming.  Thank you Sophia Coppola, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and the whole crew (and Japan!) for this AMAZING movie!!!",1079049600,7,1591,4.932584269662922

This, ""21 Grams"", ""Mystic River"", ""Shattered Glass"", and a host of others, make such a welcome change from the routine. Scarlett Johansson is a luminous talent. You should also watch her in ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"". Bill Murray shows he can act when given the chance, as he did in the excellent ""Groundhog Day"". Those who want to see him just goofing off Ghostbusters style should look elsewhere.

1505593,5,B00005JMJ4,"Could this possibly be a bad movie?
No it could not.
Bad movies do not inspire the kind of love that those who love it (including critics and the most discerning filmgoers) have for it. Nor do they - at the same time - inspire the negative feelings that others have for it.
What it is, is a highly personal movie, a film that's different from what some people expect. And what a rare thing that is.
I know that connections can get you a lot in the Hollywood film industry. But what connections can't get you is talent. Sofia Coppola has that in spades. And one of the most fascinating things is that it's a very feminine talent, very unlike that of her father. The world of ""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation"" is certainly not that of her Dad. It is at the opposite extreme from his occasional bombasticism and operatic sweep.
Coppola is a miniaturist. A painter of emotions. Like ""21 Grams"" although in an entirely different way, this is a film that takes effort on your part. It's a movie for people who can understand genuine emotion instead of the ersatz and fake feeling that we're usually spoon fed. COmpare it with Eric Rohmer, if you know who he is. Murray and Johansson are both superb. Lance Acord's cinematography does miracles on a low budget.
It's funny about Tokyo, and its characters, but also loving. There isn't any meanness in it.
I loved the scene where Bob let his morals slip and woke up wondering what had happened. I loved being able to laugh at that, and also knowing that it was - in a small way - heartbreaking. And yet, she has no reason for her heart to ache. It does anyway. And that's how life is.
For those who bring up ""prejudice"" issues, I say get a life AND a reality check. Bill Murray is over six foot tall. As someone who has been to Asia I can tell you that, yes he is going to tower over a lift full of average height Japanese. He towers over Sofia Coppola in the interview on the DVD. That's hardly being prejudiced against Sofia Coppola.
This is a film for grown-ups, in a movie-going world with all too few such films. Looking at some of these reviews it seems there are all to few grown-ups too, whatever their chronological age.",1079049600,12,2184,4.395061728395062
1505594,5,B00005JMJ4,"The first time I saw this movie I enjoyed it, but things didn't really connect up for me.  I was too concerned with where the movie might be going to actually see that it was already there.
I now find this film to be brilliant, moving, and uncommon.  It establishes it's theme immediately and adds layer after layer as it moves along.  You'll read a lot of retellings of plot and descriptions of things people found comical.  These are all fine, but, to me, they miss most of what makes this film so special.
Okay, the film starts with a shot of Scarlett Johnasson's [behind]-and I can only guess what that means.  But then we cut to a beautifully shot and scored scene in which Bob (Bill Murray) wakes up in a taxicab as it cruises through the brightly lit streets of Tokyo at night.  He rubs his eyes, as if waking from a dream (or into one).  Amongst the unintelligible (to him) signage, he sees a large billboard of himself:  he is somehow an accepted part of this overwhelming landscape.  Then we get a close-up of a flashing neon sign with huge Japanese letters, as if it is announcing something absolutely germane to existence.  What does it say?!  Well, to people who can't read Japanese, it doesn't say anything.  That's the point.  No matter how urgent or spectacular the presentation, most everything we encounter in life has no inherent meaning.  This movie is filled with such images-and the fact that many of them reference the Japanese culture is incidental.  Every culture is filled with customs that seem odd or silly to those outside of that culture.  (One could easily argue that the present state of American television programming is just as absurd as the weird stuff that's on Japanese TV in the film!)
Amidst this landscape we have Bob and Charlotte, each trapped in a life that, for them, lacks depth.  By that I mean that they are unable at the present time to grasp with confidence onto anything ""more than this""-that is, anything more than the surface of existence.  They may have the funds to stay in a wonderful hotel, but there is nothing intrinsically wonderful (or terrible) about their lives.  Their lives have basic comfort, but little else.  There is no joy in their careers, and they are both in marriages that have settled into passionless routine with people whose priorities lie elsewhere.
What Bob and Charlotte recognize in each other is themselves.  Charlotte searches for something that she can connect with (religion, tradition, culture, etc.); the film gives us many examples of her observing others going about their daily endeavors with zeal and/or devotion.  None of it is the right fit for her.  When she meets Bob, she discovers someone who has the same cross to bear, but is much further along in the journey.  ""Does it get any better?"" she asks, and his first instinct is to say, ""No.""  It's this shared burden that makes it so touching when they are half-flirting, half-commiserating, and he sings to her, ""Show me one thing more than this... There is nothing.""
I'd better cut this short, but let me say that it's no surprise that a lot of the reviewers here have had strong, negative reactions to this film.  It's only right that so many should not ""get"" it; in fact, I'm shocked that the movie has found such a large audience:  at its deepest level, this is a movie for those of us who don't ""get"" most of what goes on in this world.",1079049600,12,3388,4.631490787269682

1505596,5,B00005JMJ4,"Isn't it exciting to see a promising new talent blossom and grow? With `Lost In Translation', we have the unique pleasure of watching three such talents bloom and find themselves. The first one is, of course, director Sofia Coppola, daughter of the grand master Francis Ford, and a proud collaborator in the family business. `Lost In Translation' is only her second feature film, but all the promises made by her debut, the acclaimed `Virgin Suicides', is fulfilled in this movie. Though it shares with its predecessor a kind of drowsy, atmospheric slowness, `Lost In Translation' is a much better structured movie, and shows Sofia truly on her way as both director and writer. It earned her an Oscar for best original screenplay, and golden globes for best screenplay and best film (comedy / musical).
The second is young actress Scarlett Johansson. I had my eye on Scarlett since I saw her in two of my favorite films of recent years - Terry Zwigoff's `Ghost World' and the Coen Brothers' `The Man Who Wasn't There'. She played supporting roles in both movies, yet I was still impressed, and not just because of her young age (in `Ghost World' she plays a highschool graduate along with Thora Birch, yet she is two years younger than Birch - she was only 16 when the movie was made!) This year, though, we can see her in two leading roles - in `Lost In Translation' and `Girl With Pearl Earring' - and in `Lost In Translation', she really proves that she's a talent to be reckoned with.
The third is - yes, that's right, Bill Murray. So, yes, he's been around for nearly a quarter of a century now, but we never really thought of him as much of an actor, right? Good though he was in `Ghostbusters' and `Groundhog Day', never before have I imagined him to be anything more than a comedian actor, and capable of playing a lead dramatic character successfully. In `Lost In Translation' he is both funny and touching, and his performance is worthy of an Oscar.
`Lost In Translation' is a beautiful, moody, atmospheric little piece of perfect cinema from a young director just beginning to show what she has to offer. It moves very slowly and has very little plot, but never gets dull. Altogether, it's one of the best and most intelligent films of the year. Very highly recommended.",1079049600,10,2281,4.676616915422885

The high point of the script is a sophomoric flipwit about Yale philosophy majors working pro bono, and it doesn't get better.

There were some scenes that were a little bit too stereotypical. I am sure that some Japanese may take those very offensive. But, somehow I felt love for Japan in this movie. Sofia Coppola lived in Japan in the past, so she must know what she was making too.  Besides, just because it is taking place in Japan, it isn't about that.  It is about feeling isolated and alinated, isn't it?  A big city like Tokyo can easily make you feel like that.  And that feeling is universal. I really felt for those characters.  I felt like I knew how they were feeling. I thought Bob Harris is a kind of like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver in New York only he didn't go as nuts.  Sofia Coppola did a great job putting those feeling out on the screen.  I really admire that.  Those who watched this movie and wonderd how it is like to be in Tokyo, try to come and visit here.

 This movie tells about american actor Harris(Bill Murray) who leaves to Japan in where he make so advertisments. Charlotte( Scarlett Johansson) is a young philosophy student whose husband works on Japan as ptotographer.
 Two sleepless people meets each other and find a special mental connection between their worlds. They dance, song Karaoke and talk together. Murray plays his part very well and shows that he can also act a serious man role(normally he plays comedy roles).
Johansson is only a 19 year old woman but she'll be a great future if she can pick as good roles as this movie.

However the plot was so horribly boring I wanted to cry. I was fighting to stay awake just so I could keep watching Bill. If you go and see this movie just don't expect anything wonderful.

The film is billed as romantic comedy, but is really about friendship, and is tinged much with sorrow as it is with humor.  Bill Murray is convincing as a world-weary movie star alone in a business-like marriage. Scarlett Johansen is exceptional as a recently married, recently graduated philosophy major with a husband more in love with his photography career than with her.  The humanity of their relationship is juxtaposed with the technological nightmare that is modern Tokyo.

Wow.  What a beautiful piece of work. I watched this with my father, and his only comment after the film was ""I don't understand why he didn't get any from her"".  He missed a lot.  And not just the lesson about saying something like that in front of your daughter.  I attempted to explain the themes of growing too large for things and not quite fitting in, etc..., all to no avail.  But hey, at least he watched something without Ahhhhhhnold in it for a change!
This film is subtle and brilliant, and definitely needs to be viewed more than once.  Bill Murray's best role since Rushmore (and if you liked that movie, you'll like this one), and Scarlett Johanssen's best since Ghost World (which grew on me after several viewings).  This makes up for that sappy, quasi-feminist Hollywood slop of a film, Mona Lisa Smile, in Johanssen's repertoire.

The movie starts out with a 15min ""BUTT"" shot of Scarlett Johansson. The movie 2 hours of boredom and then when you get to the end of the movie you have no idea what happens. Bill whispers something in her ear and you have no idea what. You can't even guess at what he said because the story goes no where. All you can deduce form this movie is that Bill Murray hates his wife and cheats on her with the bar room singer, and Scarlett Johansson is mad that her boyfriend does not pay attention to her and decides go after bill Murray.

Bill Murray keeps demonstrating that he is one of the most versatile and talented actors of our time.  His dry wit matches perfectly in this melancholy film about a man drifting in a sea of loneliness.
Scarlett Johannsen plays a young neglected wife who crosses the path of Murray several times in a Tokyo hotel.  Together, they share in each other's quiet despair while denying that there are romantic feelings brewing.

Toss in American Rhapsody's up-and-comer Scarlett Johansson, doing her standard ""like, duh"" face. Dip them both into emotional torpor in the sleek Park Hyatt, add local color, stir. Et voil: Lost in Translation.
For Sofia Coppola, this must have been the easiest pitch in the world -- which is perhaps helpful when pitching to Daddy. The youngish director and heiress to American cinema did things her way a few years ago with her ambitious adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel The Virgin Suicides, crafting a truly poignant slab of Middle American art with A-list Hollywood talent. This time around, though, her effort feels as pedestrian and confused as its subjects. She hasn't delivered a turkey -- it's a cute little movie, if not as rich as her brother Roman's similarly themed CQ -- but when work this potentially satisfying remains flatly obvious, it's almost worse than being flat-out bad.
We begin with a close-up of an ass, and it's tempting to suggest that the remainder of the film is simply a product thereof, but the project's kindly nature doesn't call for that kind of harshness. Rather, the tone is more distinctly bumming. The peach-panty-clad glutes belong to dewy depressed Charlotte (Johansson), who's loitering at the Hyatt in hopes that her busy photojournalist husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), will take five to comfort her. No such luck, but Charlotte does find a surrogate friend in Bob Harris (Murray), an American movie star and cultural castaway who's in town for the noble task of plugging whiskey.
Perhaps it cuts just a little too close to home when Charlotte bemoans: ""I just don't know what I want to be. I tried being a writer, but I hate what I write. I tried to be a photographer, but I don't take good pictures."" Well, that's OK, but if she's the director's mouthpiece, we've got a problem. This is further complicated by Lost in Translation's being another feature shot on 35mm film with an A-list cast. An amateur with a DV camera would be more welcome under these circumstances, or even the director herself just wandering with her friends across the street from her father's San Francisco offices into Chinatown.

And she has never looked so beautiful!  If you like her and haven't seen Ghost World, then be sure to check that one out.  She's great in it and it's a better movie than Lost in Translation too.
In Lost in Translation much of the humor is dry and understated, perhaps even a little obscure.  To me the most interesting thing about this film, besides the acting, is the scenery in Tokyo and seeing how some people live there.  I don't recall many movies set in Tokyo - maybe it's too expensive to film there -- so that was pleasantly different.
The story, however, is thin.  And was all that cigarette smoking and booze guzzling necessary?  I don't think so.  I felt like I was watching a movie made in the 1950's.  Maybe the producer got a lot of money from whiskey and cigarette companies...  It's disheartening to me to see films made these days still displaying such things that everyone knows is harmful to people, especially when it is not necessary to the story.  Bill and Scarlett are smart and interesting characters in this film, but are diminished by these actions.
So overall, it's quite entertaining, but not great or profound or really special.  After all, it was probably mostly just a practice exercise for Francis Ford Coppola's daughter Sofia, the writer / director.  So just enjoy watching Bill and Scarlett and seeing Tokyo, and don't expect much more, then you will enjoy the movie and not be too disappointed by the lack of a real story.",1078790400,13,1599,4.644128113879003

It's flat sad the whole time.  Bill Murray just restrains his actions more to get serious and only gives one joke at a time and the jokes are spaced at least 15 minutes apart.
It does make you wonder whether Bill will bag the girl or not and that's the suspense of the movie.  I guess also the girl and Bill make each other's time in Tokyo less lonely.  I just wasn't moved by this movie.  You'd think a guy making $2 million to fly to  Tokyo to do a commerical could afford to bring a few friends along so he wouldn't get bored.

This movie was one of a small group of movies (which I can count on one hand) that has left me with a real appreciation of the beauty that's possible in film, and in some ways, in life; It's also very funny, and I recommend it highly. However, it's apparently not for all tastes, despite it's beauty and hilarious moments.
It's apparently (based on several other reviews) not for those with short attention spans or without an appreciation for true cinema art, which this is.

Essentially that is the plot of Lost in Translation and if you've ever had that kind of experience more than likely you will come away touched by this beautifully moving, emotionally touching film.
If you like your films plot driven instead of character driven, then this film isn't for you. There's isn't much else to tell about Lost. Two lonely hearts, alienated by their personal lives and befuddled by Tokyo's cultural and communicational differences, reach out to each other, bond on many different levels while exploring Tokyo and learn more about who they are along the way.  When the final frame concluded, I found myself sobbing in my chair.  I have been fortunate enough to have a similar experience (although not in Tokyo) and was incredibly touched by Lost in Translation.
Murray is fantastic and subtle, Johansson is a breath of fresh air, Coppola's direction and cinematography is superb and the soundtrack is flawless.  Although definitely Oscar worthy on all counts, I think the media hype hurt rather than helped the film.  Some people who saw this based on the hype came away disappointed and frustrated (see any of the one or two starred reviews below).  See this film ONLY if you meant to see it before it got all the media recognition.
In closing, I don't think Coppola was trying to be artsy or trying to send a message.

1505786,5,B00005JMJ4,"What is going on with you people?  One star reviews for one of the most resonate motion pictures of the year???  This movie contains the most real acting I've seen in 2003 outside of 21 Grams.  The atmosphere is beautifully layered with elements of thoughtful speculation, light humor, the neon glaze of Tokyo, and a very deep melancholy.  I cannot understand how anyone with an interest in people and relationships can dislike this movie!  If you were expecting a typical Bill Murray flick and didn't get that, blame the product placements and ads, not an amazing and unique movie such as this.  ""Lost in Translation"" was never intended to be mainstream, but after such critical acclaim and Bill Murray in the title role it had no other choice.  I can understand some people who expected pure comedy being dissapointed, but how can anyone not be delighted with a movie as real and hearfelt as this?  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson are complex and endearing characters.  The direction is perfectly subtle as it allows us to simply watch these two interact with each other and the environment around them, slowly building a relationship beyond what they can understand.  There is humor, but it plays a supporting role, as it does in life.  So lets set the record straight--do not buy or rent this movie if all you want is the typical Bill Murray fare, because you WILL NOT get it.  What you will get is a film of great atmosphere and depth, with wonderful performances, and very real emotions.  It is a subtle film, but a great one.  Try to watch it without expectations, and give the film its due attention.
P.S. The long conversation scene in the hotel room at night is an amazing feat of acting and direction.",1078704000,7,1714,4.688963210702341

It was a waste of my time and all the plots lines they could have pursued, they didn't.  It was a major disappointment since I like Bill Murray and the previews for this movie made it seem a lot different than it was.

1505788,4,B00005JMJ4,"'Wow' is all I can say ... Sophia Coppola has just made up for ruining Godfather III.
This is just a wonderfully simple movie about the idea that some of the most touching moments in your life may be some of the briefest.
Coppola also does a terrific job of conveying that disconnected feeling that you can get when you travel to another country.  As if the world is still moving, but you're no longer a part of it, you're wandering around outside of it all.
I really could go on for an hour about all the ideas that Coppola, very subtly, pushes out there for her audience to think about.  What really impresses me though is that she managed to convey all of these themes without beating the audience (i.e. - me) over the head.  She really leaves A LOT out there for people to discover themselves.  I find that refreshing.
This is an intelligent movie that really is a must-see.  It's every bit as good as it was hyped up to be.",1078704000,4,928,4.310344827586207
1505789,1,B00005JMJ4,"I had to watch ""Lost In Translation"" on a Saturday morning in order to get through it (I fell asleep 2x at night). Don't watch this movie if you're even the slightest bit tired - it WILL put you to sleep. I kept waiting for something important, something relevant, or something even the slightest bit exciting to happen... and it never did. All the Oscar hype was pure insanity. Being a big Bill Murray fan, I HAD to see this movie. Murray has some classic movies on his resume - ""Ground Hog Day"", ""What About Bob?"", ""Caddyshack"", ""Rushmore"", etc... but by no means is this one of his best. I do not stand alone on Amazon (as of 10/18/07, there are 570 ""1"" star reviews). Bill Murray plays Bob Harris. Scarlette Johansson plays Charlotte. The movie focuses on these two sad lonely individuals on the other side of the world... in this case at the Park Hyatte Hotel in Tokyo. Bob Harris is making TV commercials for Suntory Whiskey. Charlotte had nothing else to do, so she followed her young photographer husband on a photo shoot. Giovanni Ribisi (as husband John) has a small role in the beginning and then he just disappears (what happened to him?). This movie is strictly about the dialogue between lonely Bob & Charlotte. There are some great shots of the city of Tokyo, a funny scene in a karaoke bar, and lots of boring talk and people staring out of windows. Other reviewers have said that ""Lost In Translation"" is heavy on atmosphere, light and mood. I'll give props to the guy holding the camera and the guy turning the lights on, but for me to sit and watch a movie... it has to be at least semi-interesting. After reading and hearing so much hype about this movie, it was such a huge let down. This movie was an utter waste of time. Borrrrring!",1078704000,2,1755,4.4875
1505790,5,B00005JMJ4,"What a charming and powerful this movie is! Clearly, with 880 reviews and counting, this movie doesn't leave anyone indifferent. Unfortunately too many people don't seem to appreciate the subtlety and simplicity of Sofia Coppola's minimalistic script, where the characters communicate in understatements, and not in multistoreyed grammatically correct sentences like in so many amateur pseudo-cult movies these days(""Clerks"" being the apex of needless verbosity). The characters, like all the real humans, and not cinematic dummies, don't have all the answers. They only feel that the answers to life's questions are hard to get on our own. Perhaps the answers they're looking for lie in the very process of communicating and sharing their experiences and feelings.
Bill Murray's acting is flawless, with exactly the right amount of dull desperation and weariness. I can't remember any actor making better use of his facial expressions and voice. And of course there are some great trademark one-liners, mostly tragicomic.
Scarlett Johansson's acting is very grown-up, introspective and very very subtle. She effectively plays a woman at the beginning of her life path, when all the roads are open, yet none of them seems to be the right way to go.
Tokyo is a perfectly surreal backdrop for the brief encounter and surprising friendship of the two main protagonists. Their cynicism (Charlotte: ""I guess you're going thru a midlife crisis now. Have you bought your Porsche yet?"", Bob: ""No, but I was thinking about it"") draws them to one another, while their hopefulness keeps them together.
At the very end of the movie, the farewell scene is both exhilarating and reaffirming. We don't hear what Bob whispers to Charlotte, but one can imagine those words are the words of hope and love.
DVD edition includes wonderful deleted scenes, which are as good as the scenes in the final cut of the movie, as well as an instructive conversation with Sofia Coppola and her collaborators. The Widescreen format of the film is a great advantage of the DVD edition: Tokyo is meant to be shown in widescreen, in all of its futuristic splendor.
All in all, the film is touching, beautiful, poignant, yet ultimately uplifting.",1078617600,,2211,5.144444444444445

1505792,5,B00005JMJ4,I have always loved Bill Murray but this is by far not only his best acting but also the best acting of the year.  The storyline is beautiful and the cinematography is great.  Buy it!,1078617600,3,183,4.2
1505871,4,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost In Translation"" is actually a pretty good movie, if you like the ""friendship"" kind of movie.  The idea is genius, I think.  But for some it isn't all that great and it's easy to see why for some.  But some movies I go see for the soul purpose of enjoying it.
Perhaps the reason why not so many seem to like it here is because of all the hype.  It happens to the best of movies that receive a lot of hype (The Matrix Reloaded comes to mind). Lost In Translation DID receive a lot of hype, with an oscar nominee for Best Picture, Director, Actor and Screenplay, it generated a lot of hype and made a lot of people want to go out and see this movie. Well, hype tends to disappoint people and so I tried to view the movie with as litle expectations as possible, and to my surprise, it worked.
Bill Murray plays a man named Bob Harris who flies off to Toyko to shoot a commercial.  His wife and kids are back in a America while he goes to Toyko to shoot this commercial. Scarlet Johansen plays the wife of a world-wide photographer who is in Toyko on business.
The two meet in a bar in Toyko and soon become friends. Perhaps what really IS interesting about the movie is their age difference. Bill Murray is a middle-aged man and Scarlet Johansen is young.  So the chemistry is in fact odd.
The characters are stale though.  We don't learn much about them and actually that symbolizes just what the movie IS. Both of our protagonists are lonely mentally and that's what ""Lost In Translation"" is all about.
Then there's the plot... well the movie doesn't really have a plot.  However, a movie doesn't have to present a plot to be good. As long as the story unfolds in a believeable and interesting way, it can more than make up for the lack of an actual plot.
My gripes with the movie. I may not live in Toyko but it seems the movie is full of stereotypes!  The fact that they show Japanese as not being able to speak as well of English and the whole bit about them not being as tall as westerners is nothing but stereotypes!  I don't mind that they joked around but its the fact that well...the movie wasn't really funny at all.  They call this a comedy but its not.
Lost in Translation isn't a bad movie, it's just been given to much hype which utterly ruins the experience of the movie.  It's a great film and Bill Murry gives one of the best performances ever.  A good movie but it isn't really a comedy.",1078617600,2,2408,4.254385964912281
1505872,3,B00005JMJ4,"There are some movies where the story, background, and other important devices are totally superfluous, and the only focal point is the characters. ""Lost in Translation"" is just such a movie. It would probably have worked just as well as a stage play, considering that the movie is basically about two characters. While the praise and Oscar nods may have raised my expectations, I found this movie to be average and insubstantial, but with good performances that elevate it from the status of a fluff piece.
Bill Murray plays perhaps his best performance as Bob Harris, a middle-aged actor who has past his prime, no longer happy in his marriage, and doing a whisky advertisement in Tokyo. Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a recent university graduate who is at a loss for what to do with her life, and has come to Tokyo with her husband, a celebrity photographer, hoping that the change of scenery will spark something within her. Of course, it doesn't. Both are in similar states of drudgery, and in Japan, a culture so far removed from their own, their unhappiness takes centre stage. Predictably, the two hit it off and find life in each other, even though it is known from the start that nothing can happen between the two of them. They are both married (albeit unhappily), and one is old enough to be the other's father. They story is very simple, how two people in a strange environment can find each other. I didn't walk away from this movie feeling uplifted or saddened, which was disappointing considering all the critical hoopla surrounding it.
Bill Murray is the main attraction here, taking a lead from other comedic actors who are making a switch to more dramatic roles in their autumn years. He is really good here, playing a more subdued role, while still maintaining a dry sense of humor. Scarlett Johansson is also good in her respective role, though her performance is hardly Oscar material. Aside from the two performances, there is very little to this movie to recommend. The script by Sofia Coppola is well devised, but in a year with so many other great movies, I find it hard to accept that this was the best screenplay. On a sad note, the humor in ""Lost in Translation"" does not come from the actors or the script, but from mocking Japanese people and customs. I was not offended, but found it sad that this was the singular source of comic relief in a movie that was supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread.
The DVD package is pretty light on the extras, but what it provided is pretty good. The interview with Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray is well done, and you get an appreciation for the passion they put into this movie. The ""Lost in Location"" documentary is nice, but nothing overly interesting occurs. It is a run of the mill behind the scenes piece. Fans expecting something more extensive might be disappointed, since there is no commentary or any other substantial featurettes. I think this was released to cash in on the Oscar hype, so a special edition is likely in the near future.
""Lost in Translation"" works are a decent character drama, but not a great one. I guess it said more to some than others, but I expected a lot more from this movie. I found the acting to be superb, but the implausible story and unfunny attempts to inject humor through stereotype dragged this movie down for me. As in many cases, the hype did not deliver the payoff. Don't get me wrong ,this is not a bad movie. It is good, but nothing special.",1078617600,4,3475,4.633711507293355
1505873,5,B00005JMJ4,"As someone around the same age as Bill Murray's character, I think the movie had a greater impact. The feeling of isolation, the ennui, and other travails of one's middle years are all here.
I liked the that the characters could develop a deep, intimate bond without jumping in the sack. It is refreashing to see a movie that can explore relationships with some real emotion.",1078617600,,375,4.696969696969697

1505875,5,B00005JMJ4,the reason that i felt so connected with this film quite simply is that anyone who has ever been in a room with a 100 people and still felt that they were alone struck a responsive chord with me!  LATER ON WHEN BOB HARRIS FINALLY CONNECTS WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IT IS STAR CROSSED FROM THE GET GO!  TO CONNECT WITH SOMEONE IN THIS WORLD IS RARE AND PRECIOUS AND TO KNOW FOR WHATEVER REASON IT WONT WORK IS HEART BREAKING .... THIS IS WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS FILM.

1505876,1,B00005JMJ4,"I was appalled that Sofia Coppola won an Oscar for her drab screenplay. First of all, the characters were unsympathetic and out of touch with the world. Are we supposed to empathize with the agony of an actor receiving 2 million dollars for a few days work and a directionless Yale student tagging with her photographer boyfriend? I doubt many of us here have the privilege to be bored in the most expensive hotel in Japan.
The stylized ennui of the whole pic was so pretentious. Scarlett's panty shots and endless staring at the window didn't elevate or convey any emotion at all. I really had to force myself awake at times when the whole film veered into an extended travelogue or a home movie. I kept on waiting for the nonexistent plot to arrive.
Finally, the 'crocodile dundee' style racism showing the Japanese as one dimensional morons or subservient is really unecessary.  As was the prostitute scene which was just a cheap play for laughs. Much like, most of the Japanese scenes which were the 'look at the wacky Japanese' variety with the help of Bill's snide comments. If Sofia wanted to portray loneliness and isolation, she could have easily done it without the racist undertone.",1078617600,24,1193,4.763285024154589
1505877,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is a beautiful film. Sofia Coppola's 70 page script was a true exercise in self-restraint, resulting in a rich yet muted film. It's an incredibly pleasant surprise to find a film that doesn't feel the need to tell a big story, but instead to explore the nuances in a small and interesting relationship.
The soundtrack is excellent, the cinematography is gorgeous and the characters are incredibly rich.",1078531200,,422,5.042857142857143
1505878,2,B00005JMJ4,"I had high expectations for this film. Its reviews were almost uniformly positive. God knows why. It has its moments, even some beautiful and touching interludes, but for the most part it is stupefying.
Bill Murray spends most of the movie wearing a blank, disinterested expression, when he's not having monosyllabic conversations with his Japanese hosts or muttering into his cellphone. Scarlett Johannson spends her time trying to devise different ways to depict hanging out in a hotel room and bar. Watching a bank of hotel security monitors would be more interesting.
There are two worthwhile scenes. In one, Murray and Johannson are lying beside each other, face up in bed, talking about what it's like to be married. In one of the DVD extras (Murray and the film's director, Sofia Coppola, are standing on a roof in Rome, talking about the film), Murray calls it one of the finest scenes of his career, and says it marks the point where a viewer will really become interested in the story. For me, the scene showed the film wasn't a complete disaster. The second scene is when Murray and Johannson last see each other. It's touching and well done.
The movie does give an extended look at Tokyo. I finished the movie with mild interest in visiting there.
Don't believe the hype. Don't repeat my mistake and buy this DVD. Don't waste your time watching it.",1078531200,6,1360,4.791489361702127
1505938,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost In Translation"" is a film that moves along at a slow, almost dreamlike pace. The characters often do not speak, but instead are shown observing their often confusing foreign surroundings. while this may seem boring to some, it's a joy to watch for those patient enough to adjust to the extremely talented Sofia Coppola's style of storytelling.
Shot in just 27 days on a small scale budget, ""Lost..."" is beautifully filmed, with the city of Tokyo and it's residents front and center in this quiet little film. But it's the unlikely love story that leaves the biggest impression. Bill Murray and Scarlet Johannson are an unlikely pair of Americans (she along with her photographer husband on an assignment, he as a slightly washed up actor pitching wiskey) who stumble upon each other, and when each suffers from insomnia, begin to explore the city together. The romance, is sweet and in keeping with the rest of the story...very subtle. And while the ending may leave you frustrated, you ultimately realize it was the only way it COULD have ended.
Both Murray and Johannson do a fantastic job of bringing their characters to life. and Murray, especially in the last scenes of the film, is able to convey so much... with just a glance or a gesture.  It's an amazingly effecting performance, and definitely his best work to date.
The extras found on the DVD are wonderful as well. The behind the scenes footage shot during the filming, is especially entertaining. My favorite moment is seeing Coppola as excited as a little girl on Christmas morning just knowing that Murray is in Tokyo, and her crying when she realizes her dream of making the movie is coming true.

It is about sitting in a hotel bar, surrounded by strangers, in a city where you don't know a single sole.  The beauty of this movie is that we see that there is hope within this lonliness, there is the potential for human connection and that that the world is really not that big afer all. If these are emotions you can't understand, don't see this movie.",1078531200,2,498,4.344086021505376
1505940,4,B00005JMJ4,"This is one of my personal best film I have seen in recent years. Although it is categorized as a comedy film, it is low-key and melancholic film (as you could see with the DVD package Bill Murray's face and posture). In the end of the film I had the strange feeling of both happiness and sadness - I ended up being melancholic.
I wished Bill Murray would take the best actor's title at the oscars, because his acting were so natural i couldn't even notice that he was acting.
I also loved Charlotte (by Scarlette Johansson), I do find this lost girl quite attractive. Other actors were pretty good too, I think.
The Race issue - I'm a Japanese myself and I did not feel that this portrayed any racism towards Japanese people.  It is true that Japanese people generally can't speak English - it took me 3 months out of Japan to get rid of the problem of mixing ""L"" and ""R"" in English pronounciation. Lot of things about Japan/Japanese in the film happens in real life, and it can be funny and strange when you're not used to the culture.
I never new that hype was surrounding this film, I saw the ad once and I knew I had to go and see it. For anyone looking for any excitement or exaggurated humour, you won't find it here. You will be disappointed as later part of the film seems quite boring (ie the Kyoto scene and onwards). However, it was beautifully shot all throughout the film and it told a lot of things.
I would recommend this film to people who are getting fed up with popular films with extravaganza & spectacles (not that they are bad). I also hope that people who might not be interested in this sort of quiet film, might rent it and see if they might enjoy it. Give it a go.",1078531200,,1690,4.28125

The feeling of being wide-awake in the middle of the night, and walking around like a zombie when you're supposed to be alert and working? You feel like you're enveloped in cotton wool, like there's a filter between you and the world around you. It can affect you even when you come home, so even your everyday life seems somehow strange, and you begin to look at it in a strange dislocated way.
That's just one of the feelings this film captures superbly. Two people coping with less than satisfactory lives find one another in the midst of a world that is strange to them. Probably the young woman's marriage won't last. Her photographer husband is too starstruck and over-awed by his clients. Bob, the actor, has lived enough to see this, and - I think - enough to know that He probably will carry on with his life.
There is solace in friendship and finding a kindred spirit. Sometimes it's like having a lifebelt thrown when you need it. Coppola's script is superb and subtle. Some people don't like subtle, which accounts for the number of low reviews here. If you're one of them this isn't a film for you.

Even in this recording of a moment of her childhood, I heard the thoughts of a brilliant young girl.  Then I saw it.  My god, it's brilliant.  I completely understood what she was trying to say verbally and symbolically.  There are so many layers to this film that it's almost as enjoyable to realize them, as it is to watch them unfold.

The performances everyone talks about...simply aren't there.  Bill Murray's worst performance EVER...he doesn't laugh, doesn't cry, doesn't even alter his facial expression the ENTIRE MOVIE!

I understand where this movie was trying to go.  It was attempting to show that sometimes even the smallest interaction with another human being can lead to major changes in your life.  I know this, but i was still disappointed.  My major gripes with the movie can be summed up in two points though.

One: I can appreciate a moment of silence in a movie...but this one had WAY too many.  While Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson each have their moments of great acting, I was too annoyed with the endless silences and long pauses that the movie seemed plagued with to really notice them.  A silent moment to allow the viewer to absorb the visual angle of the movie or as an emphasis on an emotional connection is a wonderful device, but when more than half the movie is completely silent and devoid of character i feel it becomes cliche' and melodramatic.
Two: I honestly did not care about their characters.  I am supposed to feel sorry for Charlotte and Bob, but they are both such selfish and flighty people that i found it difficult to empathyze with them.  Perhaps this was the point of the movie, but i feel that i've been cheated when i watch a movie and find no emotional connection with the characters.
In short (yeah, right).  I just don't think this movie lived up to the hype that was put on it.  It had some wonderful visual moments and some great acting (at times), but i wouldn't sit through it again, much less buy it.",1078531200,8,1647,4.493288590604027

I spent the first several minutes wondering if the movie was going to get moving, but then it slowly enveloped me. See it with an open mind, and patience.
A lot of people have commented that the Japanese are being mocked and so the film is being racist. As a regular Japan-o-phile myself, I was a little uncomfortable at first, but when the movie started making sense to me, I saw it more as a depiction of the lead characters' mild culture shock than anything else. In other words, we're seeing Tokyo through their eyes, for what it means to them. I think the humor is innocent. And it is hilarious too.",1078531200,,772,4.368055555555555
1505947,3,B00005JMJ4,"I've never seen Murray in a film that was as poorly suited to his talent, perhaps because he is so comfortable with comedy. This sad movie was made sadder by the parody of the wasteful days people will spend trying to make money. His noble gestures with the young wife were somewhat unbelievable, and were made all the more admirable because of it. Both of their efforts to prevent getting together, however, left the viewer all the more interested in seeing that happen, since it appeared to be what might have made both of them feel connected to life. Although the sources of their anxiety was different, both suffered from the detachment that people often feel when they seek each other out in territory that is not quite familiar to them. It's sweet that they were able to become friends, but the audience wanted more. Had Murray used his energy (that wasn't displayed) to enjoy her company, and teach her to enjoy herself without having sex, it might have been the solution to the despair they both felt trapped in the situations they perceived, probably accurately, they were in. Obviously, as the more experienced person, that would have been more appropriate for Mr. Murray than for the inexperienced young woman. It surely wouldn't be realistic to have to come from her since she was not in the ""preferential position"" he had on location; besides, older men should expect to lead in such a situation, rather than to be ""entertained."" Elders generally have the responsibility for setting both the pace and the level of appropriate engagement. While he did tackle that problem, it was not without prompting, and considerable reservation on his part, almost as if it was so little value to him that it wasn't worth his time or effort. This is not exactly the ideal method of retaining ""fan power"" although she exhibited that initially until he came so morose that they were left with nothing more than peripheral observations that substituted for connection. Murray is capable of more, and has in the past given more to his artwork. Perhaps the right film hasn't come along, or perhaps he was somewhat burned out, as in jet lag. It was a disappointing performance, but could have been attributed to the strange ""twists"" of the film, a new female director's first try, I heard.

I am worried that somebody reading this might think there was a worse movie made than this in 2003, so I am choosing my words carefully.
First, I suggest people who want to make a living writing, directing or producing movies to avoid this so it doesn't in any way influence the way you judge what is considered creative.
I am convinced the movie was filmed in one day and the rest of the money that was supposed to go toward making it was stolen.
This movie did more to undermine the credibility of the Academy than ""The Crying Game"". I feel that the Oscar nomination is now firmly an economic device that has abandoned all sense of artistic merit.
All because of this movie.
I don't understand why so many individuals give this movie 5 stars while at the same time pointing out that this movie could understandably bore the hell out of someone.
This movie would make a good public service announcement as to what it is really like to suffer with depression because the experience was depressing, and not in an entertaining way.
This movie was also very racist to the Japanese. I am embarrassed that this was given an Oscar nomination and profoundly apologize to the nation of Japan as a whole.",1078444800,24,1210,4.504545454545455

It is a movie that is not about 'nothing' but a film with the stillness of everyday life at its center.  The performances are so finely nuanced that they no longer seem like ""Acting"" as the movie barely seems to be ""Directed""; the transparency that is achieved by this work of artistic creation will grow as the years pass by  -  as we strive, in contrast, fifty years from now, to remember the name of that year's oscar-winning director whose amalgam of sound and fury signify, ultimately, nothing.  -  I must add, four years later, that this film is best seen in the theater.

Cut the constant establishing shots of the city and the movie would barely make sixty-minutes.

No way this movie could or should have been seriously considered for best picture.  Same with Bill Murray for Best Actor.  Much as I love the guy in other movies (Groundhog, Knew too Little) I had a hard time believing he was ""serious"" about this role.  The more the movie went on, the more it seemed that he would really rather be ""someplace else"" (not trying to act the horrible script, for example).  The humor was unfathomable and had a mystic, ""should I laugh here?"" quality to it.

1506012,3,B00005JMJ4,"I don't want to simply restate what everybody else has written, but I want to address a couple of points about this movie.
The pacing---If you know ahead of time that you will be watching something very slow, then this probably won't be a big deal. Just be sure to watch it at a time when you can handle the deliberate speed.
The acting---It's all pretty good. Bill Murray does pretty much the exact same role as he had in ""Rushmore,"" only without as much charm.
The romance---This is definitely not one of the greatest love stories ever. The two main characters are both so uninteresting, their love is so inexplicable that there isn't much reason to hope they get together. Watching them fall in love with each other is sort of like viewing a nature documentary on the mating rituals of slugs. It just feels so, so wrong the entire time--there aren't any sparks or fireworks or rushes of joy in the movie. People like to say that the love story is great because it is ""subdued"" rather than forced like a typical movie. That's all well and good, but the romance in here isn't ""subdued""--it's beaten with a tack hammer, gagged, blindfolded, and then sedated with 4000 cc's of horse tranquilizers. The ending is the only good part of their story.
The script---This is the biggest problem with the movie. The script is so poorly written that I cannot fathom why it won an Oscar. The humor is about as low-quality as you can get, and often wanders into what I would call racist territory. Another customer here commented that many of the jokes hinge on the fact that the Japanese mix up l's and r's. It turns out that about three-fourths of all the ""jokes"" in the movie are just scenes where the main characters sit around and poke fun at the Japanese. It is a sad, sad movie when the most brilliant joke in the movie is, ""What? LIP them? Don't you mean RIP them?""
To be fair, however, the movie does have many beautiful shots. The direction is actually very good, no matter what the speed of the movie might be. The acting, as I said, is generally pretty good. In fact, everything in the movie that ISN'T the script is generally pretty good. It's such a shame that all of this was ruined by awful jokes and lame dialogue.",1078444800,6,2219,4.481481481481482
1506013,5,B00005JMJ4,"I saw this film knowing little about it and thought it was lovely.  My friend who I saw it with thought that it was ""OK"", and had the same problem I've seen many reviews articulate: that the characters were much too distant.  I, on the other hand, enjoyed this distance, it reminds me somewhat of that aspect of Hemingway's writing.  I understand that this movie didn't ""do it"" for my friend, and she understood that it affected me differently.  That is why I don't understand the viciousness which so many of the reviews on Amazon hold.
I can understand many of the criticisms in the 1-star reviews for this movie.  Some I don't, like the comments about racism and portraying the Japanese poorly; this movie isn't meant to show the Japanese in a balanced and politically-correct light, it's meant to emphasize the bizarre and disconnected feelings that these already melancholy Americans [who aren't particularly thrilled to be there in the first place] are experiencing.  It's a feeling that's difficult to articulate without seeming offensive and narrow-minded in our PC-obsessed world.  But, ok, even the people who saw racism in this movie are entitled to their opinions.
What I do not feel they are entitled to is accusing those of us who did enjoy this film of being either ""elitist intellectuals"" or followers unable to form an opinion for themselves.  Though it's inevitable that there will be people who only say they like this film to impress their friends, I don't see why one should get so angry because different people were touched by this film while they were not.  There are even reviews by people who might be considered [by the people who use this expression in a derogatory manner] ""intellectual elitists"" who disliked this film, for their own reasons, and so it seems ridiculous to label all of us who enjoyed it as such.
As I said before, if you hated this movie, then I'll respect your opinion as long as you respect mine.  There are many films considered ""wonderful"" or ""brilliant"" that I've hated, but I won't berate those who enjoyed them.  This film works for some, and for many of the same reasons fails for others.  Clearly, Sophia Coppola wasn't trying to make a film that everyone would like.  It is simply like any good piece of art: you may or may not like it, but it has certain indisputable [and disputable] merits that must be recognized.  Honestly, I'm glad that the whole world didn't fall in love with this film.  It would get pretty boring to be constantly saying, ""Wow. That was great.""

Holding either opinion does not define you as superior to the other side. As for the comments on Tokyo and Japanese, I think this movie could have taken place in New York or LA or London. It is about being far from home, and not being connected with where you are. I have traveled many times on a direct flight from the Orient to New York or Washington DC. There is always a disconnection beyond jet lag. At home I wear a shirt and pants to work. In New York its a suit. The daily concerns of New York are just not like those at home. Tokyo is just different then the US. Not better or worst, just different.",1078444800,,740,4.181818181818182

1506085,1,B00005JMJ4,"What is wrong with this movie is that it desperately wants to be profound, but it feels like Sofia Coppola wrote herself into the corner and didn't know how to solve it.  In the end, it seems, she was unable to solve it even for herself, so she leaves the ending an enigma, and not even an engaging one.  There was no climax to this movie, and there was next to no plot.  Certainly a movie could still be a great picture without either of these things, but to do so it must convey SOMETHING to make you feel better for having watched it, and Lost In Translation failed at that.
The little plot this film did have was disjointed, which, while adding to the overall feeling of confusion, left me feeling a disconnect with the characters and their circumstances, It jumped around without any regard for scene continuity.  This did not create the feeling of being ""lost"" so much as it created a feeling of a lack of direction and attention to detail:  The ""friends"" Charlotte knew in Japan she never spoke to or appeared to know, and she of course abandoned them without thought, the two characters connection that jumps to familiarity with hardly a conversation, Charlotte asking Bill Murray's character he can come out with her that evening without telling him her name, room number, what time, or where they should meet, and then the sudden appearance of Bob in her hotel room making himself at home.  Because of scene discontinuity and flat dialogue, the characters feel one-dimensional and do not inspire me to feel any connection with them, even though I have felt the emotions they seemed to be struggling with many times.  There are a lot of moments in the film that almost allow this connection, but they are too few and far between to get any real sense of the people involved, and we see the main characters much in the same way that they seem to see Tokyo: far removed and unrelating.
Part of the characters' one-dimensionality seems to come from Sofia Coppola's heavy-handed version of ""subtlety.""  An example is the obvious comparison between the way Charlotte's husband reacts when the pretty blonde approaches him, and the way Bob Harris  reacts in almost the identical setup.  If the movie's plan is to be a subtle portrait, which I can only assume is the purpose, then I would prefer it not to hand feed me such details, but let me discover them for myself.  This kind of writing seems to have come directly out of some beginning screenwriter's handbook, not from the hand of a genius.
Overall, the movie manages to express the feeling that you get when you're stranded in a foreign place, but it failed to take that feeling anywhere.  Yes, there is some wonder, some oddity and confusion, some loneliness and introversion, an assessment of your life especially compared to what's going on around you, and an amplification of your own thoughts because you're isolated.  But what of that?  What is the insight, the revelation?  What makes this movie important or worth wasting 2 hours for?  We've all felt that, we all know it.  Going there with a couple of uncharismatic characters was not worth my time or my ten bucks.  It's like taking a 35mm picture of a strange couple in front of a sunset.  In the first place I don't know the couple so I don't really care to have their picture, and in the second place, the 35mm picture couldn't capture what the sunset was really like, especially if I've seen it first hand.  You need to give me something more, and Sofia Coppola didn't in this film.",1078358400,6,3506,4.624193548387097
1506086,5,B00005JMJ4,"What to do while watching: Try to guess what's going to happen. Meanwhile, don't miss the savvy sound track and fascinating glimpse of Japan
What to eat while watching: Sake from one of those square, wooden cups. If you don't own one, you could make one from scrap two-by-fours. How hard could it be?
Some people don't like it. For them it's not enough, somehow. Maybe it's too haphazard, too free from uproar and hysteria, too much like regular life. Maybe these are the people who feel that movies should be something far bigger than life--more like reality TV. For them, Lost in Translation is exactly that. That the Academy-Award-winning screenplay of Sofia Coppola hinges to some degree on an inaudible line might throw off viewers who like things to be simple and obvious.
Your friend Gooden tends to get grouchy, however, when a writer or director holds my hand too much. I don't want to see a family reunited knowing that I'm expected to cry. I like when a story ends before all plot lines are drawn to a close, like the final scene in Laurel Canyon where the protagonist sinks into the swimming pool, questions unanswered, or Memento where you leave the theater unsure what happened or countless other examples.
I like to reach the end of the film wondering about the characters in their world. Especially when I'm watching a DVD and I have time to look at the bonus features, which often adds fuel to my imagination's fire.
Lost in Translation is very subtle. There are several transcendent moments that tie back into the title without elbowing you in the side. Coppola's other work The Virgin Suicides stands in contrast. That film was heavy handed in all regards with broadly stereotyped characters doing things that were as predictable as they were melodramatic.
Obviously Coppola has matured as a writer. The uncanny Bill Murray shines as Bob Harris, an aging movie star well into the product-spokesperson phase of his career. He travels to Japan to film whiskey ads and finds himself sunk into deep loneliness. He does not like hobnobbing with the sundry Westerners who recognize him and around the Japanese majority in Japan, he is awkwardly blocked by linguistic and cultural barriers.
In the same hotel is Charlotte (the fetching Scarlett Johansson), new wife of an up-and-coming young photographer. She's come with him to Japan because she's just earned her philosophy degree from Yale and doesn't know what else to do with herself. Note that Johansson is a transparent, or at least translucent, doppelganger for Coppola herself, a young woman, born to a leisurely life, trying to find herself. Such is the woman we saw at the awards petulantly fidgeting with her Oscar.
Charlotte is clearly a brainy character. She takes herself by day into Japan to discover its mysteries and wonders. Nevertheless, she too is lonely with her husband gone most of the time. In a subtle moment, she glances at some polaroids of her husband and herself. In these photos, he is looking out of the picture at the camera, not at Charlotte. She notices this at a significant time, but the moment is simply what it is: no attention is called to the detail, and, in fact, the Mrs. didn't even notice it.
Both Bob and Charlotte are plagued with insomnia, and they take to drinking in the hotel bar. It isn't long before they meet and, charming as they both are, they start to hang out. They drink together and eventually have a nighttime adventure when Charlotte goes to visit a Japanese friend from college and Bob tags along. The all-night party takes them from place to place in a dizzying montage of Japan's hip cultural circles. At last, the two fall asleep only to repeat the adventure the following night.
The story sets up for a torrid love tryst between the young Charlotte and the mature Bob. In many movies, something explosive would have to occur, bringing sadness, regret, craziness, murder, or something to grip the ""gimme-it-straight"" type of audience member. But this isn't most movies. Both characters have their marriages, challenges and all, and Bob deftly sublimates the sexual tension.
The friendship, therefore, is very touching. The two teach one another very lovely and ephemeral lessons. I call this movie a classic because it has a sense of innocence and simplicity that I associate with golden-era films. There's an earnest attempt to portray several characters, two in the middle, with all their foibles. It's a film like this that one can enjoy like a good book. It can envelope you and change you with a soft touch. I look forward to Coppola's next work.",1078358400,,4579,4.841836734693878

One thing I don't understand is the people who use the term ""art film"" as an insult. There are no art films. There are good films and bad ones. This is one of the great ones.

1506089,5,B00005JMJ4,"I enjoyed the film a great deal, and apparently for some of the reasons that many other people disliked it... the lack of plot line, and the less then in depth character development.
Yes there was little plot, but isn't that the point.  When we get lost in life, we lose our own plotline so to speak.  Bill Murray's character Bob Harris is in just that position.  His career has peaked, and he's no longer angry about it, just accepting.  The magic/excitement has gone out of his marriage, and he knows that his children have something to do with it, so its not bad, just different (because he loves having children - ""They are the best people you will know"").  If he were at home in a more comfortable environment his state would be covered up in activites, friends, family, etc.  I mean why did he go golfing in the middle of the film?  To try to find something familiar that he could grab hold of.  Unfortunately for him it doesn't work either.  It is only with this young woman (well played by Scarlett Johansson), also lost, that he finds some solace, as they share their perceived problems.
The fact that they don't have any real reason to be upset, doesn't matter either (I mean who wouldn't like to go to Tokyo for 2 million dollars to advertise whiskey). It is self perception that colors our lives, and each of these characters feels emptiness, and it is only their common feelings, and culture that brings them together.  Ultimately their friendship keeps each grounded in a foreign land.  In my personal favorite movie moment, Bill Murray states just that in the excruciating version of More than This, the Roxy Music song.  He looks at her and sings that there is nothing more then this, and in that moment Bob Harris means just that.
As far as the depth of character, how well do we know each other after a few days.  I was crazy about my wife, but what I knew about her was quite superficial as compared to the 13 years we have been together.  I know I would like to know more about each character, but I definitely knew enough about each of them to care about them.  If I knew more about them, honestly I may like them less.  For example how old are his children or wife, compared to him.  Does he have a previous family that he left?  He is an actor after all.  We could come up with the same type of things for Charlotte.  Rather I want to know the characters from the few days they show us.  It is those people that I feel for.
I agree with the few who have written that it doesn't matter what he whispered to her at the end.  I, like the one previous reviewer, can't put it in words, but it works for me.  They are connected, and that is what matters.
I can't speak highly enough of Bill Murray's performance.  I did not see Mystic River, so I cannot compare his performance to Sean Penns, but did see Pirates, and I feel that his performance was at least as good as Johnny Depps.  I will continue to see his movies, because he is an outstanding actor, something I would never have thought possible fifteen years ago.
The scenes in Tokyo as almost all have agreed were wonderful to behold.  I really liked this movie, and do recommend it, but understand that like anything else it is not for everyone.",1078358400,7,3221,4.380471380471381

I saw another review saying that the movie shows signs of racism against Japanese people, indicating that they are short and that they don't speak English well. Well, they don't, and they are short, so this is not racism, but just amusing.
The mood of the movie is very consistent, some people might say depressing, I would say layed back and inspired by the ability of the actors, especially Bill Murray, to show emberassment, amusement and astonishment about themselves.

I usually compare movies like this to the parable of the Emperor's New Clothes.  Critics watch the movie and see absolutely nothing of value in it.  Somebody plants the idea in their head that they don't see anything because they're stupid (when in reality, it's just not there).  So then the critics write great reviews, and all the elitists out there are too afraid to disagree.

1506171,5,B00005JMJ4,"As one might reasonably surmise, due to the excessively positive reception of this film (in terms of aesthetic cinematography and acumen of craft) I was somewhat piqued to see it for myself.  After all the extortionate lengths that some critics have endeavored to pursue in adulation of this movie (in particular Bill Murray's performance and Sofia Coppola's script and direction), try and imagine the diminutive fraction of possibility that this film might actually have a reputation that precedes it.  Come on, Ebert readily assessed it as a work of sheer brilliance, Siskel's foreskin foreheaded doppleganger Roepert opined likewise, and every other person who ever witnessed it regaled its power to be tantamount to the second coming.  In what absurd, deranged, and forlorn alternate dimension could the facts possibly divagate from the hype?  Well keep your cosmonaut shoes on, because you need jaunt no further than your local multiplex or video store to see how incredibly fallible the majority of critics truly are.  Now, what is wrong with the picture?
 One of the unfortunate misgivings about this movie is the fact that the trailer and all its satellite previews made it appear like some kind of standard Murray comedy.  We are given brief glimpses into the more garrulous scenes in the picture, all of which if properly taken out of context and arbitrarily collocated into a filmic presentation would approximately last no more than 45 seconds (hmm, the usual running time for tv spots that advertise these films).  But I can willingly forgive a fallacious trailer as long as I am supplied with some modicum of entertainment.  Not since Gigli have I suffered the kind of cine-masochistic audacity that is prevalent in Lost in Translation.  I can at least commend Gigli on the fact that it made ample use of its running time by appropriating a little something called dialogue (albeit a banal, deliriously unfunny discourse), whereas Lost in Translation decides to express itself in the form of epigrams.  We are given a random collection of words that are so disassociated with human emotions - lines that are empty, callous, frigid, and insipid - that I have heard more convincing dramatic delivery from C-3P0 and his four inch tall life partner R-2D2.  Simply put, no one in this movie knows what sentimentality is, nor would they recognize it if it lodged itself in their urine canal.  But hold your trendy tongues you art house phonies, to any of you who would so naively conclude that I am not familiar with pictures that fail to utilize the standard pentameter of Hollywood banter, for that is far from the case.  2001: Space Odyssey and Eraserhead are both films that confidently employ succinctness in lieu of loquacious rambling.  Yet those two films differ from Coppola's film in the one major way : they actually supplant their silence with a redeemable artistic aspect.  But the script (or lack thereof) is only one of the baneful obstacles this turgid priapus cannot competently penetrate.
 Let me address the area of performance from our two main actors, Bill Murray and Scarlet Johannson.  Scarlet's character is supposed to be a jaded philosophy major.  The staggering problem of this is the fact that she barely attempts to open her mouth and say something intelligent.  I do not particularly care if Sofia Coppola was trying induce a full-blown aneurysm from those people who watch her movie and recognize the aberrant timidity of her lead heroine, nor do I care if she was trying to suggest the vernal obfuscation of the character who merely studied philosophy on a whim but now finds herself abruptly distanced from the world - such trite characterization that clumsily fuddles with assumptive subtext wretchedly turns a viscid knife in my stomach - because quite honestly, her character made me feel absolutely nothing.  I no doubt theorize that I would receive warmer reciprocity from the rubber inguinal notches of a blow-up doll.  But what is most offensive to me as a moviegoer is the superfluous praise of Murray's ""outstanding"" performance.  If someone would kindly delineate to me the fundamental differences of Murray's character here and his portrayal in other movies, I would most humbly appreciate it.  The fact is this:  Bill Murray plays Bill Murray playing Bill Murray in this movie.  He assumes the role he has assumed in every single movie he's ever been in (save for Caddyshack).  The dry wit, the partial smile, the frequently bumptious lifts of the eyebrows to punctuate the irony of a situation - check, check, check, everything seems to be in order.  And though I do appreciate Murray as a comedian, I do not think it befitting to flank him with vociferous hosannas and felicitations simply because his character appeared flaccid for an entire hour and forty two minutes on screen.
 So we now set our sights on Coppola as a director.  Given the size of her father (in terms of work and mountainous girth) it is indeed foreseeable that she will be subjected to nepotistic juxtaposition.  But as most of you recall, it was the young voluptuary herself who single-handedly turned the Godfather III from lesser-sequel to garish and straight-to-video histrionic horse manure.  Not apparently content with assassinating the repute of her father's career (after the bloated anti-climax of the last in the Godfather trilogy, he went on to direct the nauseously stifling Jack, a schlocky Robin Williams picture of Spielbergian pseudo-emotional magnitude), the young auteur has decided to proliferate her vile bacteria into the careers of other people.  It's a shame, because if Lost in Translation had been a different film entirely, like Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, it might have been good.  But as it is, it is pure garbage.  Try Monster or American Splendor, two wonderful films forgotten by the burgeoning circle jerk of American critics.  As for Lost in Translation, it definitely attests to the presumption I had that Roger Ebert is an imbecilic merger of words who's increasingly offal taste in movies (something that has never ceased to baffle me) is at the prompt vanguard of the declining state of film recognition.  Here is a man who can volubly opine for two hours on the eminent importance of Orson Wells' great progeny Citizen Kane and the surreal mastery of Fellini's 8 1/2, yet is so obdurately stubborn that he rejects the greatness of movies like Blue Velvet and favors this disposable garbage.  It may seem incredible, but remember that this agglutination of lard bestowed his prestigious and ever-cantankerous thumb of approval to such tripe as the Hulk and Blue Crush.  Bahh.
  There are moments here, though they may be evanescent, that begin to show signs of life - we are traduced into believing a character could delve beyond their static veneer and actually articulate a genuine emotion or two.  There was one scene in the movie when I was so stupid as to presume the torture would lessen and the movie would at least end with an inspired spark, no matter how uneven the events leading up to the denouement.  That scene was the karaoke scene, where Johannson's character bellows an uncertain and stodgy rendition of the Pretenders' ""Brass in Pocket.""  Subsequent to her performance, Bill Murray belts out an Elvis Costello tune.  But even as that aroused some interest it made me much more critical of the film's astronomical failure.  As he sang ""What's so funny about peace, love, and understanding"" I began to feel even more molested by my viewing experience.  I have realized why.  It seems that brief sequence is comparable to the film in its entirety.  It flirts with presence of life, it appears to be vibrant and amassed in the blinding neon lights of Japan, yet it reveals the story and the characters as lifeless, mirthless, miserable creatures who faintly utter disjointed nonsense without the slightest palpebration of energy.  The whole movie was so dreadfully absurd in its tragi-comic awfulness that it really made you think of the crooning losers who act like unproclaimed kings in karaoke bars.  Lost in Translation is like that.  Its amateurish, but not in the warm way of most independent movies.  It is stunningly pointless, an exercise in futile relations and even more of wayward characters who have not the capability to recognize their pitiable selves.  It's not that the characters allow their emotions to distract from their enactment with one another, no, it is something far more drab and lugubrious.  It is a representation of two faceless characters.  Two desparate people who cannot recognize the futility nor the audacity of their desparation.  I am reminded of the final scene when Murray says goodbye to Scarlet's character.  That one scene (coupled with the karaoke singing) provides explanation for the entire summarization of the movie.  It is endless and inauthentic, a documentation of absolutely nothing!  Yet it continues to prow along, moving forward despite the lack of enthusiasm or concern, not because Sofia is trying to convey some vague statement about the inefficacy of human relationships, nor because there was a point at all, merely because it is like its characters, it does not possess the proficiency to do anything else.
Why do I anoint it with 5 stars then, if I so evidently despise it?  Because I get a sense of slight satisfaction with the thinking that maybe some lowly desk clerk at Tip Top Video will be perusing through the higher reviews for snobby affirmation of his devotion to this film, some dull expatiation about the esoteric quality of the movie and how others are fools not to appreciate it, only to unearth an inveighed condemnation of unquestionable disgust for a movie that barely qualifies as cannon fodder.",1078358400,,9758,5.012399256044637
1506172,5,B00005JMJ4,"I also saw this film without knowing anything about it. And I experienced it differently from my husband. He felt that the trailer conveyed a slap-stick comedy. I, on the other hand, sensed something melancholy. I also connected with it on the level of having myself been an American in a ultra-modern, chaotic Asian city, namely Hong Kong.  When I was there, I couldn't wait to leave, but once I left, I couldn't stop reminiscing about it. That's the feeling of this movie.  The environment is an assault on every sense -- from the 24-hour blazing neon, bustling traffic, constant crowds to the over-the-top entertainment spectacles. In the film, as in real life, the experience is overwhelming and exhausting. And the jet-lag doesn't help. Bill and Charlotte never do quite fit in. The effect is a sort of loneliness that hurts while they're experiencing it, but a feeling that connects them, and that they won't soon forget. We know that back home these two would have never had any kind of connection. In a way it's like a war story that unites people through their common tragic experience, but who would otherwise never have connected. My sense is that people who truly get this film don't ponder what Bill whispered in Charlotte's ear. You just know. You can't articulate the words, but you just know.",1078358400,7,1308,4.808888888888889
1506173,5,B00005JMJ4,"I've only read the latest two reviews before feeling the urge to put finger to key. Some aspects of this film have been covered to death so I'll try to avoid them, and just stick in the stuff that people seem to miss or misinterpret.
The last reviewer suggested that the film suffers from being directionless, which is exactly the same reaction I got from a friend of mine. The film isn't plot-driven, and isn't meant to be. The approach is almost documentary-style. What you see is a series of choice scenes, probably edited from three times as much footage (I read in an interview that the script was only 75 pages long and much of the film was improvised). It seems that Coppola gave the characters to the actors and let them explore the themes of the film.
Which brings me to the second point. Two reviews down someone says there's nothing to think about, quite an astonishing criticism given on how many levels the film explores the themes of it's title. Many cliches are turned on their heads in this film, not least the mid-life crisis theme. The title alone cuts the cliche down to size, exploring how in Bob's (Murray) life things have literally been 'lost in translation'. Even with his (now dwindling) success over the decades, his expectations of life have not been met. Something has been lost. These themes are much explored in Ozu's masterpiece Tokyo Story too, a film that Lost In Translation's detractor's would no doubt abhor, as adored as it is. Bob is also the end-result of a character at the other end of life, Charlotte (Johannson), who having just married a workaholic photographer, is beginning to see exactly how life will turn out. These themes of what so many of us lose out on in life are the main crux of the film, and the most compelling and profound. But the title has other meanings. We see Charlotte exploring Japanese history alone, and is left cold by the beautiful temples and feels distant from the traditional Japanese weddings. Not only is this because she has no-one to share these moments with, but it's also the oh-so familiar tourist feeling of going all the way to see something that you know you should be excited about, only to have the reality let you down for no apparent reason. The idea of these attractions often are the attraction, but the reality often loses something in translation.
On another level, the film explores the translation (as in change of co-ordinates) of people from one culture to another, and here the film has been accused of racism or stereotyping. Stereotypes are indeed invoked, but along with the mixed up 'r's and 'l's there's an American actress thanking someone for thinking she was aneorexic. The kneejerk reactions to these rely on double standards and are not to be taken seriously. Coppola obviously has great fondness for Tokyo, but is as willing to criticise and indeed poke fun as she is to make ode to.
As well as people being translated between cultures, the translation of cultural phenomena between cultures is explored. An insane talk show shows how the Graham Norton formula doesn't work everywhere, and that's a real show!
So there is plenty to think about (and talk about judging the length of this review), it's not racist and it doesn't rely in the slightest on narrative drive or character arcs (what would McKee think?). It is a beautiful, beautifully judged film about realising the limitations of most lives, and getting through one week of it with someone who is a stranger but you still recognise. There is a definite duality here, a contradiction of how disappointing and yet how exciting life is, evoked most explicitly when the wonderful Bill Murray turns another cliche on its head by giving the obligatory speech about how wonderful it is to have children and at the same time inferring that this is also a loss.",1078358400,6,3820,4.737237237237237
1506174,4,B00005JMJ4,"In describing Lost in Translation, I can say that Bill Murray is a funny actor regardless of the setting.  I don't think many if any actors could have pulled off this role as well as he does.
The movie presents glimpses of two people's lives as they befriend each other during their ennui in Japan.  The development of the relationship between Bill Murray's character Bob Harris and the character played by Scareltt Johansson is enjoyable and is really lovely.
I enjoyed the scenes of the Tokyo nightlife.  The movie just seems to fade away in ending.  There is no defined plot or climax and the audience must decide how it ended, what the lessons are, and what the point is.
The movie is relaxing to watch, not too stimulating or exciting but enjoyable.
The bar for it was set high by the many praises in the media so it did not meet those expectations for me but I was not disappointed.  I liked the characters and that made the movie.",1078358400,4,937,4.488235294117647
1506175,4,B00005JMJ4,"I find it interesting to find that 709 people have reviewed this film. That says something about the film. Whether you like the film or not it has generated a lot of comment.
I saw the film without knowing a thing about it other than Bill Murray was in it and another Coppola was involved. If you have read the reviews you know that Bill Murray is lost in Tokyo and connects with a much younger woman. At first I thought this was going to be another younger person - older person romance but it is not. It is about two people in a foriegn land finding a common need in each other. And thats about it. Nothing much happens other than a romp through Tokyo. But I watched it knowing I would be watching it again and if you are purchasing a DVD that is important. To me, anyway.
I found the ending to be very satisfying, leaving me wondering how a woman as young a Sophia Coppola could get inside the head of a 50 year old male. In the hands of most it would have been a straight romance. I am interested to see where she is going next.",1078272000,4,1032,4.1138613861386135

E-bay to the rescue!",1078272000,5,307,5.0
1506177,3,B00005JMJ4,"I really wanted to see this film. Mainly, like some people have said here, to see Bill Murray. Was I satisfied? Well yes and no. If I were to watch this movie before all the hype began to build I would have been giving you a 4 or 5 star review perhaps about how tragic this film entwines the characters but sadly when you put hype and Oscar nomination talk together it usually drowns out what might have been fun about the film in the first place. The film is brilliantly acted and it is really funny in places. As ever Bill Murray gets the best lines although Scarlett Johannsson does manage to get a few in herself and it does leave a distinct mark in your mind
So why 3 stars then? Well as I've said this film has completely been drowned out by all the critics' rave reviews of the film which is a shame really. What is understated could be passed off for underwhelming in some people's eyes. And I don't really blame them for thinking that. If this wasn't as talked about as it was - perhaps people could have enjoyed it a little more without some weight of expectation around it
I am glad though that the film picked up an Oscar. It deserved one if nothing else. It was, if anything, Oscar material.....but then usually I don't go for those types of movies ( American Beauty being a major exception ). I went to see it for 2 reasons - Bill Murray and I liked Sophia Coppola's last film - the fantastic Virgin Suicides.
So to cut it short I would recommend people watching this but I would also advise to lower your expectations - It isn't a major full blown piece - just a softly-softly film",1078272000,5,1596,4.270627062706271
1506244,2,B00005JMJ4,"Although a nice looking film this isn't even Bill Murray's best film to date. There are couple decent scenes, but it moves along very slowly at times. You have one character going though a midlife crisis and another with maybe a little neglectful husband. Both characters just seem to be bored with their lives and the only thing that makes this movie half interesting is they are in a different setting being in Japan. Sofia Coppola deserves some credit for shooting this in less than a month and writng the screenplay for a young director, but those things shouldn't come into play when juding how good a film really is. Scarlett Johansson looks good on screen and has a nice presence, but that could be just all those underwear shots they had in the movie. Just becasue a film is set in modern day Japan, ""oh its so quirky and strange"" doesn't make a great movie. There are better movies out there set in modern day Japan that never received this much critical acclaim one being Kikujiro. Some seem to have been Lost in the Hype on this one. No commentaries from Bill Murray, Sofia Coppola or Scarlett Johannson is also a negative in terms of the DVD.",1078272000,8,1154,4.552884615384615
1506245,4,B00005JMJ4,"First off, Lost in Translation is obviously not for everyone. Some people may not be able to connect with the movie due to the way it tries to convey its messages, and it does it in a way that most people (besides movie reviewers and actors) cannot recognize. Truly, because of my profession (I work in a video store), I have to listen to people come back and complain about how much they hated this movie. The reasons for dislike range from boredom to religious reasons (the two main characters are married, and during one scene they lie on the same bed, but nothing happens!) In my opinion, one should never judge a movie that is trying to be realistic due to religious reasons. The reason I actually docked this movie by one star is simply due to the fact that it really is not for everyone, and it can be somewhat irritating how slow it moves. However, this movie is absolutely great if you like slow, realistic movies.
I found that there are three basic elements to the theme/message of the story, this is just my take on it, so it differs with what a lot of people may say about it.
1) There is the setting. Our two main characters (Murray and Johansson) are two Americans that seem to be isolated in a foreign land, namely Japan. This is one element that I think a lot of people can connect to, especially if the person watching has been to foreign countries. There is the language barrier, and Murray finds himself being given surprising short translations from long, Japanese instructions. One has to wonder what was really said (hence the title), and this really adds to the feeling of isolation.
2)There is the fact that these two Americans actually meet and become very good friends due to similar circumstances in their lives. Anyone knows that having a good friend is important, but it becomes even more so when they are isolated in a foreign country. So Murray and Johannsen connect big time. Yet there are other factors that come into play here, a romantic involvement that can never be (as far as we know) because both are married. This presents a huge barrier that ends up being the third element of the movie.
3) Murray finds that he has really deep feelings for Johansson, and at the end of the movie you can see that Murray really needs to let these feelings become known, and he does it with a final act (I am not going to spoil it, but I think you can guess). Anyway, the end is the culmination of how Murray finds himself through feeling he has and expresses for Johansson.
Overall, the movie is not that exciting. If you want flaring guns and growling beasts, watch Underworld. This movie has a lot of subtle humor and it can convey quite a bit of meaning. However, if you do not really want to be thinking about the movie, and just want to be entertained, this movie is not really for you. I found it enjoyable but do not recommend it after a hard, stressful day of work.",1078185600,2,2897,4.4576271186440675
1506246,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is kind of movie that you yawn during it, but can't live without after you finish the journey.  It's all about loneliness.  General americans cannot understand the deepest loneliness.  You think lonely is when you are alone in the house and talking to yourself?  No, the deepest loneliness is when you are in a crowd and no one talks to you, no one touches you, and even no one looks at you.  They are all occupied by their business and have no slightest interest in you.  The loneliness is even deepened when the environment surround you are so beautiful, and you have no one to share with.  When I watched the DVD alone in my apartment and had a couple laugh, I realized I made the right choice moving to the States, because I was there.  I am too familiar with the loneliness.  As such, I don't think this film will have any luck when release in Asia, because the film is just about the daily life of people there.",1078185600,3,922,4.345029239766082

*Copola's wine making skills are even questionable ... at a local Oscar party, not only were they pouring his wines, but a rep of his was there, and serving ""champagne"" in cans.  Where does commercializm end?  And why didn't Murray's character pitch his wines rather than Whisky ... :)

If you hate it, so be it, but there is a chance you will not. And that is when the magic will happen.

1506321,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation for me is the perfect movie.  It uses none of the Hollywood cliches found so often and instead tells its story in its own way.  Reading a summary of the story, one would have trouble understanding why this film has garnered so much praise, yet upon viewing it is obvious.
The characters relate in such a way that you are almost there with them as they blossom their relationships.  Sofia Coppola has crafted a wonderful experience that slowly takes shape over the 100 or so minutes before it ends.  I have a feeling this is a semi-autobiographical story in a lot of ways, but if that's what it takes for a writer to build something like this, more power to her.  I give her credit for putting her own life into the mix when necessary, yet still creating new fiction that helps the story reach such a powerful peak.
Some of the characters are a bit ""thin"", such as Charlotte's husband, but the emotion displayed by Johansson tell all that is missing from his role.  The same effect is there when Bill Murray talks to his never seen wife on the telephone.  I just loved how this movie never had to dumb it down to the lowest common denominator to get the story across.  The scenes with Scarlett and Bill (which encompass most of the film) are so subtle, but at the same time powerful, that I was completely into it the whole time.
This film tells me that American film can compete with the great films of Europe when the correct ingredients are present.  Unfortunately this film is rare for American films.  Watching the Oscars last night almost left me sad to see Bill Murray come up short in the best actor category.  Then again, acting awards are completely ridiculous as all roles are subjective and cannot be compared.  Also, I have seen enough of the Academy Awards to realize that the prize usually goes to the most over the top acting out there.
I guess this is rambling but if it helps another film lover to see this film, I have done my job.  Enjoy it (or not) and go from there.",1078099200,7,2007,4.435967302452316
1506322,5,B00005JMJ4,"The opening credits focus lovingly on Scarlett Johansson's rump as she lies in bed.  We follow her as she gets up to look out the window of the Tokyo hotel room, focusing on a facsimile of the Empire State Building.  Bill Murray is introduced with much greater fanfare, as he arrives at the hotel in a shiny black limousine with the lights of the porte-cochere reflecting off the windshield.  He is in town to do a commercial for Santori whiskey.  An aging actor whose draw seems to be mostly in Japan.  Coppola takes her time in bringing these two actors together.  At first a fleeting glance, then seeing each other in the lounge.  They seem to come together out of boredom more than anything else.  The movie initially has the melancholy tone of Leaving Las Vegas, but Coppola takes a warmer look at her characters.  She doesn't let the film devolve into pathos, but keeps it relatively light an airy, as the characters embark on a whirlwind tour of Tokyo, led by an intrepid Japanese guide.
The film offers a wonderful assemblage of Tokyo life replete with Murray taking a picture-perfect swing on a long fairway with Mount Fuji rising in the distance.  Coppola makes no effort to translate the swirl of language around these characters.  Murray bemused that by the truncated translations of the commercial director's instructions.
Both characters find themselves in dead end marriages.  Murray has been plugging along for 25 years, sticking it out for no other reason it seems than for his kids.  While Johansson has only recently been married to a fashion photographer who seems to have little time for her. Rather than be a tag-a-long, she spends her time wandering around Tokyo in search of some intrinsic value, momentarily seeming to sense it in a traditional wedding she spies upon.
Mostly, she seems to be wanting reassurance, which she was unable to get when she calls her parents.  Enter Murray's world-weary personage.  It is really a shame Bill Murray didn't win an Oscar for this role.  It was a beautifully understated performance that showed what a consumate actor he is.  Johansson more than holds her own to Murray, making her mark in this movie.  But, what holds this movie together is the remarkably sensitive camera work.  Sofia Coppola is a very gifted director, able to see so much in subtle details and drawing the most from her actors, which she first exhibited in The Virgin Suicides.",1078099200,2,2413,4.813106796116505
1506323,2,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" shows once again that, while Sofia Coppola has a fine eye for visuals, she is a poor storyteller.  This movie comes across like a pouting super-model, beautiful and fashionable and sophisticated looking but attempt to scratch the surface and you will find less than a fingernail's depth.  The ennui of the idle rich.
Bored and rich are the characters in this film.  Bored with their treasures so undeservedly received, as in the case of Bob's million-dollar commercial.  Bored with being rich enough to not require an occupation, but trying to pass the hours in some fashion, as with Charlotte.  Bored with the expensive hotels, the dives, the temples, their families. Really, there is nothing that cannot bore this boring duo.  Ennui at its most self-indulgent.
I have no problem with a slow storytelling style, or understated and unspoken dialog.  I am a huge fan of Ozu, and I know how a master craftsperson can manipulate emotions using a minimal of stimulus.  However, as the saying goes, Sofia Coppola is no Ozu.  Her storytelling lacks the depth necessary for that style, and it comes off as an affectation.
Shallow as ""Lost in Translation"" is, there are some redeeming qualities.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a find performances, the best possible when working with such material.  The visuals are lovely, and one can almost catalog the influences director by director.
The treatment of Japan has often been called racist, but, aside from the prostitute scene, I don't think so.  It is no more racist than ""Crocodile Dundee"" and presents about as accurate a portrait of the country and its people.  Don't come to Tokyo expecting to find what you see in this movie.
Its too bad that the staff didn't go with their initial impulse, and fire Sofia Coppola and bring on a more talented director.  The same cast, with the same concept could have produced an excellent film.  Coppola could have stayed on as cinematographer.",1078099200,14,1963,4.942073170731708

I tend to dislike movies that have a more subtle message, or require too much thought to figure out what it all really means.  Then I saw ""Lost in Translation."" This movie is not obvious about the message it is trying to get accross but as a person who hates to think about movies, this one required some thought and I enjoyed it even more because of that.
This movie was moving, beautiful, thought provoking and just all around enjoyable.

The idea of the story was almost at complete odds with the movie. Acting was bad, and directing too. I was happy that the story was recognized by an Oscar, but not the movie!",1078099200,4,403,4.45945945945946
1506408,5,B00005JMJ4,"I thought it was one of the two best movies I saw last year, the other being Thirteen.
Some complained that it was slow. I guess it is true it had virtually no plot. But the brilliant character study of a man realizing he's passed the high point of his life and is on the downward slide was unforgettable and poignant. The picture is completed by the intersection of his life with that of someone who has all of her possibilities in front of her, although she has a hit a momentary bump in the road. It adds more poignancy still that she is a gorgeous young woman who he probably could become sexually involved with, but won't, and with whom he falls into a rather chaste love. It's not that he's not looking for love or solace--he is. He casually sleeps with the chanteuse. But makes sure he doesn't interfere with Scarlett's life. He turns her loose, and doesn't lean on her. It has a kind of Victorian agony in the choices made. At the end, in the famous scene where he whispers something you cannot hear, everyone is left to give their own interpretation and fill in the blanks. I would guess, consistent with how I interpret the movie, that he said: ""I love you, but this is as far as it goes. Call me sometime, and let me know if you ever need help. I'll miss you.""
A beautiful film.
It would've been my choice for Best Picture, although I understand why they felt they needed to honor the LOTR trilogy .",1078099200,2,1410,4.324528301886793
1506409,2,B00005JMJ4,"First of all let me say that I truly appreciate those filmmakers who strive to say something witty or subtle with their works. Cinema can be such a very high form of art due to its excitation of multiple senses. Who can watch a true masterpiece and not be stirred emotionally?
Having said the above I must state that in my humble opinion Sophia Coppola's ""Lost in Tranlation"" falls very short of the mark. The idea is beautiful, truly creative and full of potential. Finding friendship in an alien and confusing world is indisputably a noble idea. However, the problem presented by this work is that this noble idea is demonstrated very early on in the film making much of the remaining content superfluous. I find Sophia's plodding relationship development confused and tedious. It's as if the film were a broken record, constantly repeating the beginning of a song as you look forward to the brilliant chorus. All in all I left this movie with a profound sense of nothingness. That instead of handling the issue with true tact and depth it was instead presented in a straight forward manner and then beat to death. Those who say that this type of shallow portrayal of humanity is masterful are either very easily manipulated by other's opinions or are very shallow themselves.
A little advice for those who have not seen this film yet. It is important to not have any preconcieved ideas about its content. If you expect to watch Bill Murray spreading sarcasm right and left you will be disappointed. If you carry no grandiose expectations and don't intend to think to deeply about the subject matter then you may be mildly amused. I gave it two stars for originality and good intentions.",1078099200,6,1689,4.7482993197278915
1506410,5,B00005JMJ4,"Fabulous DVD release.  The special features have expanded scenes and out-takes.  Great extra footage of Bill Murray on the Japanese T.V. show wrestling an eel.  ""Big Surprise"".  Worth the price of admission right there.
Sophia Coppola does a great job of walking the fine line between humor and being objectionable or offensive.  An easy line to cross when having fun and not making fun of another culture.  Putting aside the dreamy Wong Kar Wai influenced story line, the movie does a remarkable job of capturing the mood of a city.  No small task when you're talking about Tokyo.  This provides a great back drop that allows her characters to step away from their lives for a brief moment.
Lost in Translation had the same affect on me as Tokyo had on the characters in the movie.  A brief dreamy reprieve to a beautiful, eclectic city.  All this and no jet-lag!",1078099200,9,864,4.7
1506411,4,B00005JMJ4,"This movie is post modernism at its best.  A comedy that is absurdly funny, but essentially goes nowhere.  And that is part of what makes this story great: it is totally believable.  It is a love story that transcends the need to live happily ever after.  You can see the love between Murry's character and Johansson's character, but both realize that their love was wayward and not meant to be.  They were brought together by a Japan inspired insomnia, but their love was based on their extenuating circumstances.
And so it is that the least funny part of the entire movie is at the end, when life continues for both characters with a new found sadness over a love that could only remain in the realm of possibility.",1078099200,6,717,4.5703125

1506413,5,B00005JMJ4,"To me, this film was an elegant, understated and highly accomplished masterpiece. I do not blame those who are dissapointed: it is like those things in life that you either love or hate.
I will not say something like ""oh they just don't get it"", because this would imply that I am somehow more clever and insightful than those who disliked it. No I am not. It is just my taste is different. Let me give you an example: I dislike Robin Williams, in fact I think that he is a shallow and one-dimensional comedian. Is it because I ""don't get"" his jokes? No. I do get his jokes, and many of them are funny. I just don't like him. He annoys me, just like Steve Martin does.
Now, back to this film - and here comes another example of different people liking different things. I love Japan (although I do understand that in this film it serves only as a background - incredibly rich, a tapestry of a background - but still only a background), but I understand and accept that many people do not. I love and adore Japanese food and their cold tea from wending machines and their trains; but so many people are left cold by this. And it is OK - because I am also left cold by many things that excite others.
I find Scarlett Johansson very beautiful (in this not-so-dazzling way) and her acting razor-sharp; in fact, I think she shines even brighter than Bill Murray in this film. I am also amazed that it took so many years for Western filmmakers to realize that an unfulfilled love can also be an interesting story.
I love that this movie does not have an answer. And I don't mind staring through hotel window: I did that in Tokyo myself, and I did the same in many much stranger places: Accra in Ghana, Vladivostok in Russia, Nida in Lithuania. Some of the most interesting ideas (well, for me anyway) I had at the time when I was staring through hotel windows.",1078099200,9,1854,4.361271676300578
1506414,5,B00005JMJ4,"I saw this film in the theatres and was amazing at the writing. When I first watched the film it appeared that there was not much of a story, yet when I thought back later I realized that I was wrong.  For example Tokyo is the seen but not heard ""third"" character. What I mean by that is Tokyo is scene as being huge and you have Bill Murray who is seen as being along. Tokyo gives the appearance of isolation. Which fuels the idea of communication. Bill Murray's character is lost in not only his own world but also where he currently is. We are giving the idea that his marriage is falling apart and is in a place that is nothing like home. These two things combined created loneliness.  The same for Scarlett Johansson being in a place where she does not fit in and a husband who is talking a past her these two people were made to find one another and connect if only for a short time.
This is the best roll that Bill Murray has done since ""Rushmore."" The same can be said for Scarlett Johansson since ""Ghost World"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"".  As far as comparing ""Lost in Translation"" to the ""Virgin Suicides"" it is hard to do because they are two different films and it is hard to say how they are alike.  The one thing I can say is that the two films has a simplified story. The images, music and silence all set the tone of the film and helped move it forward. This is compared to have the story, dialogue, and music move the movie, and tell us how are to feel. I tend to like the first way better because for one it breaks away from the ""standard boring American"" flicks.
This film is truly an art house film. Because the expectations. Most American's need instant gratification of story, plot and character and have everything spelled out, and spoon-feed to get anything out of the movie. For those of us who do not these things it is a great movie. When you take ""Lost in Translation"" for what it is; a story about two people who are lost in their own worlds and seeking a connection.  It's reasons like this that makes this movie work.
For those who say you have to watch it a few times I agree with it. Though I got the film on the first try. For those who are going to hit me in the face a few times go ahead, you might beat some of the ugly out of me and improve my looks so thanks for offering.

And along come the ""jewel"" of the film, Scarlotte Johanson. Her character is much like Bill Murray's, alone and confused.

It's redundant to say that Bill Murray is excellent; his bad performances are few and far between.

1506466,2,B00005JMJ4,"I bought the DVD this past Saturday night before the Oscars to see what Murray did to warrant a best actor nomination. I fell asleep on the couch midway through it, enveloped in the pervasive artsy-fartsy ennui. It was painful to stay awake to that point. I awakened to a scene where Murray was laying down on a bed in a yellow-orange shirt staring up at the ceiling. Unbeknowst to my ennui addled brain rebooting from a REM cycle, the DVD had ""frozen"" as they are sometimes won't to do. But since it was a brand new DVD on its first playing, that possibility had not yet occurred to me. I actually watched that frozen scene for a full minute, thinking it was part of the movie since it was entirely in keeping with what I had endured to that point. I actually had to watch for the absence of an eye blink and respiratory motions before it dawned on me that the DVD had frozen.
I have read other reviews that say you have to watch it three or four times to fully appreciate it. I'm glad it's soon to be spring - watching the grass grow would be infinitely more appealing.

In stead of having it told to you, this movie acts it out...you have to interpit it. People have even complained that you never know what they whisper to each other. To me, I loved this movie because it had an almost zen quality to parts of it. The relationship of the two main characters is deep. Its two people finding another person who sees them and sees the flaws there, and having no demands of each other, forge a some what carefree love that is more like an awakward teenage romance than it is a love afair or anything.

1506469,3,B00005JMJ4,"This highly acclaimed film was eagerly anticipated by the sophmoric directorial debut of Sophia Copella. With ""Lost In Translation"" the sights and sounds of Tokyo, Japan, are incredible, along with a stunningly beautiful actress, Scarlett Johansen (Charlotte), and a quirky actor, Bill Murray (Bob). This light-hearted comedy of a wayward man lost in the midst of a bustling metropolis--and the Japanese language--along with the bored wife of a photographer, makes for a humdrum movie. The actual movie takes a backseat to the special features on the DVD. The film's crew encountered adversity head-on overcoming incredible odds: With an impending Japanese typhoon, dealing with horrendous pedestrian/vehicular traffic, and the city's language barriers, they accomplished a great deal during the filming of the movie in spite of the extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.
Happenstance was abound in this film in which an older man and a young woman meet at the Park Hyatt Hotel, in a nice restaurant overlooking the city, surrounded by the incredible ambiance of friendly people, classical music, lights, lights, and more lights.
I was very disappointed that Bob and Charlotte's relationship didn't evolve like I'd hoped. There was more talk and less action between the two. I'm wondering why they didn't shack-up at the hotel? Anyhow, I didn't think this was Bill Murray's best work as he purported it as being.

1506470,2,B00005JMJ4,"Before I watched Lost in Translation, I was very excited to see it. I have been a fan of Bill Murray for as long as I can remember and the film was receiving a lot of praise from the critics. I set out to watch a film that was original and inventive. Instead, I got to sit through 2 hours of a boring and extremely overrated film. Sofia Coppola did write an excellent script. The idea behind the film has a lot of potential, and the entire film was shot in Tokyo which added realism to the film. But, the story just seemed to never go anywhere and after the film ends, you don't feel any closer to the characters than you did at the start of the film.
I simply do not understand why Bill Murray is being nominated for Best Actor for his performance in Lost in Translation. Before watching this film, I was excited to see his performance because all the critics were saying that only Bill Murray could have pulled off a role like this. I was expecting to have a lot of laughs and to be impressed with the performance overal. Bill Murray's role consisted of two things. The first was sitting around in bars getting drunk and talking with Scarlett Johansson. The second is singing karaoke. These are two things that any actor could have done. There was absolutely nothing special about his performance at all.
Unfortunately, Lost in Translation is the type of film that you either really enjoy, or you really hate. There really isn't any enjoyable middle ground in this film. I personally think the film is extremely overrated. Watching Bill Murray get drunk and sing karaoke does not equal an enjoyable film for me.  Now, fans of the film may not appreciate my honesty. However, with over 700 reviews and only a 3 star rating overall, I am not the only one who feels this way. Soffia Coppola may have set out with good intentions. However, good intentions mean nothing without the follow through.",1078012800,8,1894,4.505813953488372

1506555,5,B00005JMJ4,"I hate predictable, formulaic movies - that's why I loved Lost In Translation. Murray's deadpan delivery is often hilarious but barely conceals his bitterness. He's an actor doing advertising he clearly considers beneath him.

Johansson is a beautiful, young, newlywed on the verge of cynicism - unappreciated and underestimated. She's tagging along with her photographer husband who is shooting photographs for various jobs. Although Murray and Johansson are dispirited for different reasons they clearly understand one another. Murray and Johansson's character's are penned in by cultural and language barriers which mitigates the usual distractions and strengthens their bond.

Scarlett Johansson is lovely, funny and witty. Murray would, at first glance, seem an unlikely match but the two have terrific chemistry.

To her credit Copolla doesn't ask the audience to make leaps of faith about the logistics of the relationship. Copolla clearly loves the characters, oblivious to their flaws and it works because I felt the same way.

My only criticism, a minor one, is the film has a lyrical subtext in the soundtrack that I found a little patronizing. Listen to the lyrics of the soundtrack as you watch the film and you'll see what I mean. Lost In Translation is not art-house dreck. It's a genuinely touching story that all of us can relate to in one form or another.",1078012800,6,1373,5.199095022624435
1506556,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is the best movie of 2003 - Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, this movie stars Bill Murray who plays the character of Bob Harris,  an out-of-work actor and a has-been that's in Japan doing Whiskey commercial.  Bob is lost in his life and going through a mid life crisis.  In Tokyo, he meets up Charlotte played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson.  Charlotte is in Tokyo with her photographer husband and is equally lost trying to find her place in this world.
As the movie progresses, Bob and Charlotte form a friendship that starts to deepen into a budding romance as these two lost souls find each other.  The movie does an incredible job of capturing these two people as they find each other in Tokyo.  The visuals are just incredible and the movie does an amazing job of capturing the magnificent vistas in Japan.
The extras on the DVD make it worth owing this DVD.  I think the 20 seconds of Bill Murray dancing in his robe in the 'Making Of' section is worth the price of the DVD.  The one thing that I was disappointed with was the lack of director's commentary on the DVD.
This is a really great movie that's also very funny which is to be expected with Bill Murray.  There are just to many great scenes and funny lines to list here, but the movie will have you laughing.  I would have to say that this is Bill Murray's best non-comedic performance to date.
I love the ending of the movie - Sofia has an amazing take on the romantic, teary goodbye and I just love the way that scene includes a private moment between the characters.  People will be guessing for years as to what was said between the characters.  The soundtrack is also really great with the appropriate song playing at the right time, including the ending.

It reminds one of the 70's New Hollywood filmmaking, when auteurs where testing the bounds of film and audiences' patience. Films like MIDNIGHT COWBOY, THE LAST DETAIL, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, MEAN STREETS, and EASY RIDER. And more recently with films like ABOUT SCHMIDT. Small films, with small plot structures, that left big impressions. And I can assure you, this is the very reason this film is garnering the rcognition it deserves. Those of you who love those kinds of films know what I'm talking about. You'll love this too. Although, you've probably already seen it.

1506560,5,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray is a comic genius. What you may not know is that he can actually act too. Here, Bob (Murray) is a former action star who is reduced to shilling whiskey in Japan. His marriage is on the rocks. And, he's basically miserable.
Much the same can be said for Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Her photographer hubby is running around Japan snapping rockers while she waits in the hotel room.
Bob and Charlotte happen across each other one day and suddenly their state of walking wounded has a buddy. Soon, they are spending every moment together. A friendship is bourne out of their loneliness and despiration.
While the movie seems to take itself too seriously at times. Probably due to writer/director Sofia Coppola being in love with her own vision. It manages to get through to us that these are good people who just need someone to understand them.
If you're expecting Bill Murray to mug for you, there is a little of it, but for the most part he is mannered and restrained as he should be given the material.

1506562,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" joins the rank of surreal films that depict life and emotions with such understated fluidity that they fall short of satiating typical Hollywoodesque tastes. ""About Schmidt"" was one. Coen brothers' ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" was another.

There is little I can add to all the other reviews already here, but I'll focus on addressing the various misconceptions that all the encomium surrounding this minimalistic gem from Sophia Coppola (with the usual baggage of expectations) has given rise to:

(1) SHOWS JAPAN IN A POOR LIGHT, OR POKES FUN AT THE CULTURE
No it doesn't. That sounds like a boorish remark from people who stopped by Tokyo for a couple of days, had Ramen at Ginza and Toro at Shimbashi, sipped a double Latte at Shibuya's Starbucks, and assumed that they had discovered Japanese culture. I still have to see a more accurate rendition of Tokyo's true day-to-day existence than this movie, apart from Tom Selleck's ""Baseball"" a few years back. Yes, the real Tokyo does have mispronounciations of words like ""Flight"" (as in, ""Have a good fright"".) Yes, real translators shorten a good deal of Japanese when interpreting as long as the message is communicated. Most of my Japanese friends would simply laugh along when told of such common trivia. This movie is as much a caricature of Japanese culture as ""Patton"" or ""Sex and the City"" are of American culture. (P.S. Murray's character also has a pretty funny remark in the film in answer to the question, ""Why do Japanese interchange their Rs and Ls?""). The film is mis-sold as being a movie about Japan, the cultural takes are comic garnish, not elemental to the romantic plot.

(2) IT IS A MEANINGLESS DRAWL, PACED VERY SLOW
Sure, if you have the attention span of a rodent in a cheese store. I found the flow of the movie very pleasing, but then I am guilty of enjoying the likes of ""About Schmidt"" as well. It's a simple, beautiful, efficient story that is completely and utterly engrossing, with economy of cinematography. It is also just a shade over 90 minutes long, making it quite short in comparison to typical movies of today. But in that short span of time, you experience a dampening feeling of entrapment, a sense of longing (and belonging), you are privy to the story of two people who are lost spiritually, emotionally, and physically.

(3) TRIES TO BE ARTSY AND FAILS
Was it artsy? I am not sure. I surely did not feel that it was pretentious. Why can film not mirror our lives and experiences without shocking or over-embelishing, and still be looked at as a remarkable and moving artform? There is a lot in the movie that perhaps may not hit a nerve with people who expect to be hit on the head with meaning. For instance, there is an overhead shot when the two protagonists were in one of their hotel rooms, in bed talking, fully clothed, he is on his back staring at the ceiling, she is on her side, eyes probably closed, the tips of her feet barely touching the side of his leg, and he moves his hand and puts it on her feet. Then the scene fades to black. It is the kind of tender, non-sexual touch that tells us how close they have become, and that theirs is a relationship of mutual trust and admiration, not one necessarily of lust. I guess this is not for everyone to appreciate.

(4) NOT THE USUAL FUNNY CAMEO FROM BILL MURRAY
Negative. I found Bill Murray to be extremely hilarious in this movie, and while this may sound arrogant, he is funny in a ""mature"" sort of a way. Like a man who doesn't have to try too hard. In fact, one thing that hits you about Coppola's direction is the honesty in the story telling. You will feel the utter frustration that Murray's character must have felt trying to make sense of a photographer giving directions with pidgin English, for instance.

(5) IT'S NOT ABOUT ROMANCE
Perhaps Titanic was then. The chemistry between the two lead characters in Lost in Translation is very moving, I'd even say it is one of the most wistful, effortless and understanding romances I have seen in a long time in film, the variety only the ilk of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thomson could evoke in an Merchant Ivory production. The very fact that these two characters find themselves groping in the middle of an alien culture brings them together and brings to the surface their similarities -- not only as people, but their similar station in life.

(6) THERE'S NO PLOT!
Right, there isn't. That's the point. I could sit here for an hour and enlist stunning movies that did not pander to an audience that necessarily needs a ""plot."" It's about a life-changing week in the lives of two people, simple as that. This may or may not work for you.

(7) IT'S ALL ABOUT COPPOLA / FEMALE DIRECTOR / ETC.
This one is the most inane. Let's talk of the film on its merit, leaving all the heritage behind. I didn't care much about The Virgin Suicides, but I have now come to admire Sophia's talents at synthesizing visual, spatial, and sonic impressions. Oodles for film students to learn from!

I adore this glorious masterpiece, and highly recommend it --

(1) If you're not expecting a pedestrian American Pie style comedy with situational goofs and gaffes
(2) If you enjoy a fluid screenplay, like About Schmidt or Royal Tenenbaums
(3) If you want to know the day to day life in Japan, not cultural stereotypes strewn about by populist productions like The Last Samurai
(4) If you relish unspoken romances like ""Remains of the Day"", ""A Room with a View"", ""One True Thing"", ""The Road Home""
(5) If you, like me, understand why the title is so wickedly clever. It's not just the meaning of language that is ""lost in translation."" It is a simple, pithy statement that beautifully captures the essence of everything that we struggle to ""find""

1506563,5,B00005JMJ4,"This movie was terrific. I can't quite think of what I like about the movie most. Bill Murray was great and Scarlett Johansson did an awesome job as well. The title of this review is "" Only for people who have an attention span"". This goes for the many 1 or 2 star reviews people gave. Some of you say that it put you to sleep. It sounds like alls you like is movies with fast cars and ones that make you laugh so hard you pee your pants. Thats how stupid your taste is. If you don't care for this movie, thats fine. But from what I read on the review is that some people said too slow or that their was no plot. There was a plot! Wake up and pay attention. Not everything has to be spelled out to you.

I won't go into details of what it was about since so many have already said as much. There is one sequence of nudity (at a strip club) but other than that, nothing I found offensive. And, yes, you DO keep waiting to see if their relationship gets sexual...and I am glad it didn't. The tension between them unfulfilled makes it all the more bittersweet.",1077926400,3,471,4.7560975609756095
1506643,4,B00005JMJ4,"I can't say I felt this film lived up to the hype, but that's not an unusual thing to say about any movie.  In general, the acting was excellent, the photography was good, and the script was mediocre.
This is a story about two dissatisfied people who meet and can relate to one another.  It's a story that's been told a million times before, most famously in its incarnation as the British classic ""A Brief Encounter"".  ""Lost in Translation"" sports far better performances by its leads and will of course be more accessible to a contemporary audience, but suffers from a weaker script.
Living in (and loving) Japan myself, I found many of the stereotypes to be untrue and, occassionally, objectionable.  However, ""Japan"" was not the theme of this movie.  The characters could have been anywhere, so long as it was someplace that made them feel like ""outsiders"", and Tokyo, as it is presented in the West, is a modern location which most Westerners think of as distant in every sense of the word.  Of course, the Tokyo presented in this film is the image we get in the States (via Hollywood, television, and any number of fringe news articles about social trends and electronic gadgets), as opposed to the real place.  As an example, for those of you who have been to New York City, compare the real thing with the city presented to you in the movie ""Seven"", which plays to every stereotype purveyed by those who have never visited of crime, perversity and destitution.
The slow speed of the film did not bother me in the least.  It's a film about the characters, not their environment, past, or future.  It's a study of loneliness and anger.  Charlotte, an otherwise educated woman, bad-mouths everything she sees or tries, from the lunch she eats with Bob (""shabu-shabu"", which is delicious, by the way), to the pronunciation of the locals' English.  This shouldn't be confused with an endorsement of those sentiments on the part of the director.  Rather, it is a window into the character's own youth (read: childishness) and inexperience, coupled with her deep unhappiness with her own life.
I do not agree that most people who have visited a foreign environment should relate to this.  I fully endorse a number of other reviewers who have mentioned that a normal person would be interested in the adventure of Japan, of seeing new things, and of interacting with new people.  But Bob and Charlotte are not normal people.  If they were, there would be no movie.  What makes a movie worth watching (any movie) is that it is about something out of the ordinary, whether that something occurs outside of the characters or inside.
That said, I often found Bob's jokes at the expense of the people around him to be in bad taste.  Almost every Japanese person he met in this movie was going out of their way to be kind and make him feel at home, but he often made fun of them.  This is the kind of behavior that is often considered ""cool"" in the West, but you won't find much of it in Japan, thank goodness.
I've mentioned above, you don't need to agree with everything these characters do- they're not heroes- but his actions damaged my ability to sympathize with him.
As for the dialogue itself, this is a film with less dialogue than average, so it was a pity to see so many throw-away lines.  I realize that most of the acting and character-development was silent, but that's no reason not to have quality dialogue also.  A small example of this is the scene in the strip-club.  Nothing here is said of any imporance.  In fact, the entire scene could have been lifted right out of the movie without effect.
Finally, to review the DVD itself.  Please note that my rating of four stars is for the film, not the DVD, which would get two at best.  This is the one and only DVD I have ever owned or rented which actually requires you to watch all of the previews.  To me, this is unforgiveable, and it is enough to ensure that I will never purchase another title from Focus Features.  The only option you have is to fast-forward, old-fashioned VCR-style.  This is bad enough, but my own player has only 2x fast forwarding available, making the process annoying, to put it extremely mildly and expletive-free.
In short, this film is worth watching at least once, but (DVD aside) I doubt it will stand up to repeat viewings for most people.",1077926400,3,4334,4.616688396349414
1506644,3,B00005JMJ4,"Right, long and tedious and if you're a Bill Murray fan you will be disappointed. Murray here is Murray in several ways, his cynical nature comes out a lot and that's always funny.
  But don't expect a Murray film.
  This one is s-l-o-w. As long as you're ready for a s-l-o-w movie, you will probably enjoy this. Watch it after a good night's sleep because Murray's insomnia will weigh VERY heavy on you if you're tired when you see this.
  Not a laugh-a-minute movie but one with a FEW laughs that are more laughs out of being cynical than ha-ha.
  The movie was shot in less than 2 weeks I heard after I'd seen it. That is interesting. I probably would have enjoyed it more knowing that in advance because it does make the movie more interesting knowing that it was filmed with very few takes and a lot of ad libbing.
  Best part: Murray on the Japanese talk show.",1077926400,3,866,4.35625
1506645,4,B00005JMJ4,"This is really a funny sort of film. The dialogue is sparse and the portrayal of Japan is at times close to racism. Yet it is strangely effective and gets you in. Probably the reason for that is that the subject matter of the film is treated with a subtly unusual in American films. It is not about the easy resolution of longings by a happy ending. It is more like the 1930's British film Brief Encounter which was about two people who meet on a train station and develop a deep affection for each other. An affection which can never go anywhere as they are both committed to their families.
In this film Scarlett Johanson plays a young woman who is coming to the realisation that she has married an idiot. Bill Murray plays an actor who has passed the peak of his career and faces the part of his life which is all downhill. Their brief friendship develops as a result of their alienation from the strange world of contemporary Japan they find themselves in.
The film is funny but in a less frantic way than Murray's usual films. Some of the gags are close to objectionable with some ancient routines about Japanese being short, obsessed with business cards and the like. However others simply work. The attraction of the film however is more the affection that you feel for the characters. One feels for Johanson trapped in her relationship, not working dependant on a jerk. Murray also plays an attractive character. A person deeply committed to his children, a bit on auto pilot but who is able to handle Johanson's character without crudeness or the sort of resolution which occurs in Hollywood movies.",1077926400,4,1608,4.625874125874126

1506648,1,B00005JMJ4,"I totally agree with all the other reviewers who gave this movie a one-star review.
  Besides the beautiful, atmospheric tone, this movie was completely boring.  Consider just watching the first 10 minutes and then shutting it off.  You won't be missing a thing.  There is barely any plot, and the ending was a waste. I usually don't give bad reviews to movies, but this movie is an exception.
  I was very angry after watching it, because all the critics had said it was wonderful and enchanting, but like one reviewer already wrote, the critics have to love it because it's ""artsy"".  Yeah, it has wonderful camerawork, but no interesting storyline to keep your attention. There is not really any music either, and that really upset me, because when a movie starts to get boring, I can usually count on the music to spark my mood.  Another factor in the movie that makes me furious is Bill Murray's so-called ""greatest performance of his life"".  It does not take much talent to sit around like a vegetable the whole movie, not showing any emotion.  He had no energy at all, and isn't the whole point of acting to transfer your energy to the audience and make your performance believable? Yes, I know that was his character's personality in the movie, but who would write up such a mind-numbing character for the big screen in the first place?
  There are so many good ""artsy"" movies out there that are much more interesting to watch.  I suggest highly, as a sane person, not to waste your time on this movie, which puts indie movies to shame. I do suggest that you see these real indie movies: THIRTEEN(2003), TAMPOPO,and DEAD MAN.",1077926400,5,1632,4.660839160839161
1506649,1,B00005JMJ4,"This was absolutely one of the worst movies I ever sat through.  I wondered how anyone could appreciate it.  There was 2-3 minutes that I laughed hard.  When the Japanese director spoke in his native tongue for a full minute and the translator would have a 5 second interpretation for Bill Murray I laughed.  Bill Murray knew he was saying alot more than that and the translator was more than abbreviating the conversation.
  My view of the movie was imagine video-taping your grandpa sitting on the front porch napping.  That was as exciting as I found the plot. Now reading the reviews I can only guess that if you actually visited Tokyo you would be able to relate to this type of boredom.  If this is what a vacation is like in Japan I never want to go.  I had friends got to Japan after college to teach English but they never said Japan was bad.

In fact, many have seen the movie more than once in order to continue their exploration of Ms. Coppola's fantastic characters.  The plot of the movie is very simple; this does not equate boring.  The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is not a traditional Hollywood romance but stands above the solely physical interraction seen in many movies.  These characters are in fact ""lost"" and find comfort in their foreign surroundings through one another.  Please see this movie.  Do not expect fisticuffs or passionate love scenes.

1506732,2,B00005JMJ4,"Many critics are still in the process of absolving Sofia Coppola for Godfather III by heaping lavish praise upon Lost in Translation.  But that's not really necessary.  Coppola established herself as an excellent director with The Virgin Suicides, a film that is in fact superior to her latest effort.
There's plenty to admire about Lost in Translation.  Coppola has a light touch that gives her pictures a distinct atmosphere that lingers far beyond viewing.  The movie continually has the feel of watching the sun rise after you've been drunk all night, and I mean that in a good way.  Plus, any movie that showcases Bill Murray and compels Kevin Shields to begin recording music again has a lot going for it.
But Lost in Translation is ultimately undone by a single weakness: Nothing ever happens.  And I mean it.  There's no real plot to speak of, no major shifts in character, no progression that compels the viewer to keep on watching.  I don't mean that someone has to be shot or that people have to start hooking up all over the place.  But in a movie, something, anything, has to happen.  Otherwise, why watch?  Many people, oddly enough, find this lack of story to be a strength of the film.  I can't even begin to know why.
Not that Coppola doesn't have numerous chances to construct a deeper story.  But moments that could introduce conflict (like Bill Murray's character sleeping with a lounge singer), are instead left dangling, almost as if they never happened.  And because the story doesn't really go anywhere, we don't get a chance to see the two leads characters emote.  There are lots of hangdog stares, exasperated looks around, and so forth.  But that isn't enough to keep the film together.  The end result feels slapped together, unstructured.  It was Coppola's intent to make you feel as lost and adrift as her main characters.  In that regard, she succeeds, but that doesn't mean the movie itself does.
There are also some oddly juvenile bits in the movie, particularly as they relate to Japanese culture.  There are some jokes about Japanese people speaking broken English, switching R's and L's.  But these are fairly tired stereotypes (even if they are occasionally true), and it makes the situations feel forced, even contrived.
Lost in Translation was clearly based on real events in Coppola's life.  And while, voyeuristically, that makes it occasionally compelling, that shouldn't be the reason we're watching.  Coppola seems to have documented a portion of her life she is still unable to make sense of.  What did she learn?  How has she changed as person?  Either she didn't, or we aren't allowed to know, and that makes Lost in Translation an ultimately frustrating experience.",1077840000,,2713,4.8818380743982495
1506733,2,B00005JMJ4,I really found this movie to be pretty bad!! I mean I watched this movie and felt no empathy for the characters. Bob was some rich lonely loser and the female role was nothing but a crybaby who was jealous of her husbands fame. I think she should have stayed home while he was in Japan if she was going to whine so much. I have truly seen the bottom of the barrel on this movie.

1506734,1,B00005JMJ4,"What a horrible movie. I can not even begin to fathom why ANYONE would even BEGIN to award Lost In Snoozland --- I mean Lost In Translation. I rented this movie over the weekend. It was completely stupid. It was so boring. I sat with my remote in hand constantly on the fast forward button looking for the actual plot to begin. It never did.
So my question is, why is this movie being touted as one of the best of 2004? I think every year there has to be a movie that Hollywood embraces to make the rest of America feel stupid. It exists to make those of us who are not part of the Hollywood elite stop and think, ""am I not smart enough or deep enough to understand what this movie is saying?""
You see my theory is there is this one guy in Hollywood, we'll call him Lou. Lou is probably a washed up old Hollywood power player. Perhaps he was (or still is) a talent agent or head of a prominent studio. Several years ago, Lou was somehow wronged by the Hollywood community. He was able to dust himself off and make it seem as though he survived the cruelty. However, something in Lou's mind snapped. He is bent on revenge. Every year Lou finds the worst movie made and embraces it. He says I LOVE this film. Then Lou sits back and laughs his fool head off as the lemmings of Hollywood follow suit. Every year Lou gets his revenge by watching how DUMB the Hollywood wackos really can be.
Now this may seem like an elaborate story but trust me Lou must exist. How else can we describe a movie like Lost In Translation being nominated for Best Picture? How else can Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray receive awards and accolades for the most sleep inducing film in recent years? Just a thought. But the next time you are in a dark movie theater or you own living room and realize that you have no idea why ANYONE would think the snoozer of the film that you are suffering through seems to be such a hit with other people, remember poor old Lou and smile as you picture him with a cigar hanging out of the left corner of his mouth, a wicked smile plastered across his face saying, ""Gotcha!""

What really struck me about this movie was that the main characters weren't connecting in an ""in love"" or even an ""in lust"" way, though there is a beautiful restrained sexual tension portrayed, but that they are connecting soul to soul.  The filmaker's brilliant choice in the ending underscores the intimate bond created between the characters.
In many ways ""Lost in Translation"" reminds me of Krzysztof Kieslowski's work, specifically ""Red"".  From me, this is the ultimate compliment.",1077840000,5,757,5.088709677419355

After living in a very modern Japan for seven months, I found the film full of the moments that make daily life here seem quite dream-like and surreal sometimes.  The film is tasteful and sweet in its portrayal of Japan to an outsider and much more honest and accurate than films such as The Last Samauri or Kill Bill.  If you are at all interested in seeing Japan the way that it really is for a gaijin (the Japanese word for foreigner - literally translating as ""outsider"") visiting the country, this film is dead on.",1077753600,13,680,4.557377049180328
1506738,4,B00005JMJ4,"In this film, Bill Murray is sublime and lost, and Scarlett Johansson convincingly intelligent, sexy and lost - and Tokyo is both their playground and prison.
When I first watched this film in the theaters, I'd likely have given this film a lower score. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson's tense friendship, on first viewing, tends to overshadow the other marvelous aspects of this film.
But watching it again on DVD, and by knowing the film's resolution, I was able to fully enjoy Coppola's unique and highly accurate take on the quirky experiences of Americans in highrise Tokyo (I know, I've been there myself).
So, what that means is that this movie bears many repeat viewings. It's filled with so many small, beautiful, moments like when Johansson takes the bullet train to Kyoto and wanders around templea and witnesses a traditional wedding that touches her and redeems Japanese culture in her heart.
And this movie is hilarious, even more so if you know how true-to-life all the bizarre and hillarious cultural items are: from the garrish fey talk show, to all-night karaoke, to bizarre sex clubs, to the fact that there's a telephone in the bathroom.
So if you saw it in the theatre - check it out again. I think you'll like it better. If you've never seen it, why not take a chance?",1077753600,4,1293,4.776785714285714

1506818,1,B00005JMJ4,"Some people have complained this is a dull, boring film.  Others say this is simply a slow-paced artful film that only sensitive intelligent folks will get.  Is LIT one of the latter?
In LIT, Scarlett Johansson portrays Sofia Coppola in this apparently autobiographical film.  In the film, Johannson sits around in her hotel most of the time (in TOKYO!!!), despondent over her failing marriage to her emotionally distant photographer husband (ie. Coppola's ex - Spike Jonze).  He seems to enjoy the lighthearted phony company of Cameron Diaz....I mean, the character who plays a Diaz-like actress.  Anyway Charlotte (that's the Johannson/Coppola character) rolls her eyes whenever she speaks, so we the viewers, will know to prefer the less-vulgar and sensitive Charlotte.  Why cannot her husband see that his own wife, while displaying no intelligent ideas or thoughts or emotions, is the preferrable one to hang around with?!  I mean, Charlotte IS beautiful, but like many beautiful women she is actually VERY sad.  She admits to Bob (more about him later) that she has no idea what she wants to do and her various artistic endevours are ""mediocre"".  She has tried photography (apparently not out of love for the medium, but rather to ""find herself""), and still her photographer-husband cannot seem to connect with her.  What is HIS problem?! Anyway, because of all this, she sits day after day in her hotel room.  (BTW, did I mention she's in Tokyo?).  Eventually, she picks up with dull-man #2, Bob (played with even more hound-dog-face than usual by Bill Murray - STILL one of my heroes, despite this venture).  You see, Bob is a movie star who is going through a ""mid life crisis"" as Charlotte puts it.  Whatever THAT is, exactly, is never really displayed.  Anyway, Bob is being paid 2 million dollars for 2 days work on a whiskey commercial, but he remains sad, as he truly wishes he were ""Doin' a play somewhere"".  Aside from this deep display of love of theater (and strong argument for the revival of Communism), Bob is confused by all these funny people around him.  For one thing, they talk funny.  And what they are saying, nobody knows!  Well, these funny-faced people constantly get up in Bob's face and jibber-jabber all the time!!  Why won't they stop?!  They talk on and on, but the funny-faced translator says next to nothing....just like the bugs bunny cartoon on the Pacific island.  Regardless, these people are truly frustrating!!  Will someone please make them act normal!  What is it you call them again?  Anyway, Charlotte hooks up with Bob at the hotel bar after their glazed eyes meet, and they soon become the dullard-duo.  She teases him with insightful cliche's about his probably wanting to buy a Porshe.  He concurs he is lame.  Later, they sing bad karoke together, while the viewer's mind begins to wander about how nice it would be to drive a Porshe. Meanwhile, their encounters continue with the energy of terminally-ill cancer patient.  You see, Bob has a shallow life...I mean Wife.  We know she is shallow, because she is only concerned over picking the right carpet color.  This is illustrated in a long scene where Bob cannot seem to choose from carpet square samples over himself and the floor, as he further succumbs to a barely-breathing motif of wealth does not equal happiness.  Still not convinced of our hero's circumstance?  Well get an earful of his deathbed rendition of Roxy Music's ""More Than This"", which he sings as if he has never heard (how cool to be uncool, eh?).  Anyway, Bob and his newfound glob seem to connect, despite their decades-separated mix of world-weary apathy and beautiful-but-misunderstood depression.  Unfortunately, all this must soon come to end.  You see...aside from some kids he's squeezed out, Bob must go back to pick out that carpet square in person.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention...Bob has 2 kids back home.  Anyway, our heroes eventually part without saying the appropriate soulful goodbyes, so Bob chases down our mallrat-with-undeserved-money-and-opportunity until he finds her...and soulfully....kisses her.  Then, he wanders off with the activity of a digestive tract, presumably only to be seen on various subway ads.  She smiles and cries.  The audience smiles and cries.  I cry.  Then we all try to get the DVD back to Hollywood video ASAP so we can get a buck back.
Want to see a GOOD ""pointless"" movie about 2 people connecting in Japan?  Try the absolutely beautiful ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"".  All the arty-farty you'll ever need, but time well spent.  Plus, it ain't racist.  Want another good film?  Try ""Being John Malkovich"" by Spike Jonze.  IT'S excellent!  AND it has a great performance by Cameron Diaz!",1077753600,10,4705,4.953964194373402

Sophia Coppolla did do a great job with this movie. I especially appreciate that she kept the relationship between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson as platonic. It shows a realistic slice of life, that is usually missing from films these days. This is Bill Murrays best role to date.

My point, however, is that as an Australian in Germany I must point out that I am very quick to let people know that despite my English speaking accent, I am not American.  Not because I hate Americans - I only hate American foreign policy and economic exploitation.  The reason I make it clear I am not American is because most people in Europe really dislike America and Americans (Germany is not especially notable for this - it is more universal).  This movie presents the stereotypical (exorbitant, culturally disrespectful and insular, lazy, self important) stereotype in all of it's hideous glory.

1506824,3,B00005JMJ4,"I've been anticipating seeing this since I read about it in Rolling Stone months ago. My friends further whet my appetite by touting it's good qualities, and telling me what a wonderful movie it was. Perhaps I had built my expectations to dizzying heights, perhaps it was the influence of others that placed this movie head and shoulders above anything I'd see. In my mind, it was Citizen Kane, the pinnacle of indi-film. A life changing experience.
Needless to say, I was disappointed. Incredibly so.
This is not a bad movie, but its not a particularly good movie either. Sophia Coppola's debut is littered with montages that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, except to make this movie drag. Bill Murray is charming, as always, but something misses the mark. Perhaps its the fact the female lead (Scarlett Johansson) seems to have take acting lessons from Natalie Portman. By that, I mean all lines are delivered in a monotone, even when she's angered. The plot is almost non-existent, and there is very little in the way of astonishing sound or cinematography to salvage this one.
It does have its good points. There are some humorous interactions between Bill Murray and basically everyone. The problem is that these interactions are few and far between. Perhaps I've become entirely too jaded to buy into the melancholy of this movie, but I just found it lacking in anything resembling a human emotion.
I read somewhere that this compares to 'Harold and Maude.' I'd really suggest that you dig that one up at some point if you're considering checking 'Lost in Translation' out. It's a far superior film, without the hackneyed directing this one has.
Again, my expectations were built to dizzying heights, and I was severely let down by this movie. I don't think I'll give it a second chance though, simply because it took too long to develop. Check it out though, it's worth an hour and 40 minutes.",1077753600,7,1913,4.817629179331307
1506825,1,B00005JMJ4,"My theory--All through Sophia Coppola's young life, she has been surrounded by people telling her how brilliant and sensitive and wonderful she is. And now, nobody has the guts to say, ""Sophia, honey, you've made a terrible movie."" We all know who she's related to, but can't we put that aside and allow this work to stand on its own.  Oh wait, it couldn't even roll over on its own, it would just lie there....completely motionless....while staring at a city skyline.....for looooong periods of time. (Kind of like the characters.) Bill Murray is great in almost every movie I've seen him in, but Best Actor?  How tough can it be to sit around and look alternately pensive and bored for 102 minutes? My biggest problem with these characters is my lack of empathy for them. Bill Murray's character complains that his wife and kids do just fine without him and he feels un-needed? Gee, maybe instead of going to Japan for the big bucks, he should hang out at home and remember little things like birthdays!  I can't stand whiny parents who feel unnecessary when they've done nothing to make themselves important to their kids. His characters success in movies is inferred throughout the movie, so why does he need an additional couple million? Who knows why anyone would pick money over their kids? Ego, vanity, arrogance....pick one. But complaining about the choice made by himself is irritating. The same thing goes for the Scarlett Johanssen character.  She's bored and no one understands her..Sheesh, get a hobby, read a book, go for a walk, learn another language, see a movie, clean up your room, do your laundry, make your bed, just for cryin' out loud....DO SOMETHING other than sit on your windowsill and look depressed. If you're too depressed to think of something to do, then go see a doctor, perhaps you need medication. If either of these characters had spent just a tenth of their time on screen being even slightly useful, maybe I'd actually have cared. This was the longest 102 minutes I ever spent.  In retrospect, perhaps the five people that left the theatre, never to return, were the smart ones. What a pretentious pile of.....fluff this film is. Save your money and read a book, go for a walk, take a long shower, take a nap, call your mom, mow the lawn, stare catatonically into space for an hour and a half, anything will be a better use of your time.",1077753600,12,2376,4.715662650602409
1506826,5,B00005JMJ4,"First off, let me say that this movie is NOT a comedy.  Admittedly, it has its funny (and sometimes hysterical) moments, but it's not a kind of light-hearted film you watch to pick yourself up.
Secondly, this movie certainly has a lot of hype (that's how I ended up seeing it), but it doesn't live up to it (and no movie ever does, as another reviewer pointed out).  If you've got some gargantuan expectations about this film, you should rent before you buy.
That's not to say the movie is bad, though.  In fact, this is probably one of the greatest films I've seen in my life.  I admit, when I first saw it, it was certainly not what I was expecting.  It's very slowly-paced, it's not your typical, straight-forward narrative, and the location (Tokyo) of the film threw me off as well.  But what counts here are the characters and their development throughout the film.  I usually don't like Bill Murray (a little too slap-stick for me), but this truly is one of his best performances (that I've seen), for he's so subtle and toned down from the whacky guy so many people are used to, but that adds an enormous amount of depth to the film.  He manages to convey so much with simple expressions and mannerisms alone.
And Scarlett Johansson is also wonderful playing a soul-searching, borderline-apathetic/jaded young wife discovering the real world and opening her eyes to, and truly looking at her own life for the very first time.  Her chemistry with Bill Murray is unmatched.  Less than halfway through the movie, I fell in love with both chracters and really cared about them by the end.
The soundtrack is also incredible.  If you're in the mood for a quiet movie that'll make you think a little (about yourself and your own life, not in terms of plot), definitely check this out.

My opinion is that when you're in a foreign country you should go out, try to adapt, see what's hot and not, basically live a bit like them and see how you like it. Clearly the makers of this movie don't agree with me. Else they wouldn't have made the lead actress (who plays the part impeccably though) sit in her underwear and stare out of her hotel room picture window for so long. Maybe its meant to 'mean something', but personally, as a guy who's been to his share of non-native language countries, I didn't identify with that at all. The only funny part was when Bill Murray was shooting the scotch ad. The end was very well made, but that makes it a sad movie. Other than that, its painstakingly slow.
That the director could show a bonding between a man and woman at a deep level without using nudity or fluid exchange is creditable. I guess.",1077667200,5,1026,4.348958333333333

1506908,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola took a big gamble making this movie, IMO  and I think she succeeded beyond her own expectations. But mine is not a universal opinion, as its easy to see from scrolling through these reviews. Its a movie that kind of defies categorization: its not really a romance, its sure not an action thriller or a mystery or sci-fi or fantasy or horror. So what is it?
I think Lost in Translation is a visual essay on the modern condition: disconnection from self, others, and ones surroundings. Heres the setup: Bill Murray plays American middle-aged actor Bob Harris (a generic name, if ever there was one, prob standing in for Everyman), in Tokyo to film a commercial for Santori whiskey. Hes bored, horribly jetlagged, at sea with Japanese language and the accented attempts of the Japanese to speak English to him, lonely, and disaffected. And heres one thing: Ive never before seen a movie with Bill Murray in it that I liked to any degree whatsoever; all schlock. But hes been underrated, I see now: hes absolutely superb in Lost in Translation.
Our man Bob keeps encountering another American (Scarlett Johansson, of Girl with the Pearl Earring fame), equally out of synch with the time zones, more or less abandoned by her photographer husband, and already, in her young life, feeling colossally alone.
They strike up a relationship of sorts, and in spite of their obvious age difference, become soul mates forever  and theres no sex.
Amazingly done. Its a beautifully understated film, sad and funny, bittersweet and gentle, subtle and forceful. I loved it. Can you tell?",1077667200,3,1583,4.881040892193308
1506909,3,B00005JMJ4,"This movie isn't intended to be a feel-good movie.  It is intended to provoke us to think about loneliness.  IT IS A COMMENTARY ON THE SEPARATION THAT EXISTS IN A POST-MODERN WORLD FROM A DIRECTOR WHO IS THOROUGHLY POST-MODERN IN HER WORLD-VIEW.
We've seen this before, many times, from Woody Allen.  But Allen's movies, particularly his classics ""Manhattan"", ""Annie Hall"" and later works such as ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", contain characters that are relatable.  Somehow, we care about them, or are at least interested in the outcome of the plot.  I REVISIT WOODY ALLEN'S BEST MOVIES EVERY FEW YEARS.  I DON'T THINK THAT I'LL EVER GO BACK TO THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS WELL-DIRECTED AND WELL-ACTED.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS.
While the acting performances are fine in Lost in Translation, and many of the situations are humerous, the characters are not endearing.  THE CHARACTERS ARE SO LONELY THAT THEY'RE JUST BLAH.  For instance, it is a thoroughly appropriate reflection of Copolla's post-modern philosophy that the characters not end up together at the end of the movie.

1506911,2,B00005JMJ4,"I just saw ""Lost In Translation"" last night, trying to view all the 2003 Oscar Contenders before February 29's Academy Awards.  After seeing it, I'm wondering if the critics saw a completely different film.  It's certainly different from its rivals for Best Picture, but different isn't always better.

Critical accolades and Oscar nominations aside, ""Lost In Translation"" suffers from a complete lack of plot and character development.  Director Sofia Coppola certainly has an eye for interesting shots, but her talents as a screenwriter need development.  Coppola is astounded at what her camera finds in Japan, but will you be?  Wow: Japan has karaoke!  Video arcades!  Obnoxious talk show hosts!  What a crazy country!

Billed as a romantic comedy,  ""Lost In Translation"" takes forever to go nowhere.  70 minutes pass before lead characters Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have a serious conversation.  Up to that point, the film presents a ""slice of life"" view of Japan.  Murray and Johansson run from one party to another, enjoying each other's company but never really developing any rapport or chemistry.  Coppola falls in love with her shots, but lingers way too long on each one, utterly failing to develop any dramatic momentum.  The talented Giovanni Ribisi is wasted in a nothing role.

I'm certainly not biased against films with a minimum of dialogue or action (after all, my favorite film is ""2001: a space odyssey"").  But Coppola's talents have not developed to the point where she can find the right notes in such a subtle story.  Perhaps she had a great film in Japan, but something has indeed been ""lost in translation.""",1077667200,4,1643,5.063432835820896

It is horribly slow, has little plot, and can these character's be more self absorbed?  Japan is such an interesting place to visit even if you don't know the language. But these characters are so shallow they can't get past the differences in the language.  If ""Charlotte"" is supose to be a philosophy grad, she sure wasted a lot of time in Japan not looking into the incredible amounts of philisophical sights and ideas that are right on the surface of this culture.

Instead, they seem spoiled, ungrateful, and just plain bored.  All the scenes showing the main characters looking out of windows or looking into their drinks become annoying when you see them for the 99th time.  I understand what this movie was trying to express, but it failed miserably and instead comes across as an immature and underdeveloped low-budget film that happens to have a big star in it and an association with another famous director.

1506995,4,B00005JMJ4,"Man, another movie that leaves audiences completely divided. Well, I had wanted to see this from the get-go, and though a friend (whose opinion I normally trust) said it didn't live up to his expectations, I personally disagree.
It is possible that if you've never immersed yourself in another culture, then you might dislike this film for a variety of reasons; you might have the knee-jerk reaction ""well, I never wanna go to Japan!"", but Lost In Translation is not a travel guide for the casual tourist. The characters in the movies are not tourists either. Bill Murray's Bob Harris is in Tokyo to do a TV commercial, and Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte is along for the ride with her working photographer hubby (played by Giovanni Ribisi). These two people are ""lost"" and confused in a world that they didn't choose to discover, so don't expect the camera to focus on the aspects of Japanese culture and history that might actually fascinate you.
So, we've got Bill Murray - another excellent understated performance (restrained in the same way as his role was in RUSHMORE) - and Scarlett Johansson (who I liked in the otherwise boring HORSE WHISPERER), and they meet in a hotel bar and develop an affinity for one another. Though it's a matter of interpretation, I don't think a romantic relationship really does or is supposed to develop between the two, still, if you are so inclined you can read into their interactions in whatever way you want. I've been the foreigner on many an occasion in another country/culture, and I can confirm that in moments of boredom and perhaps confusion it was a relief meeting a person who was in the same boat as me. Does that mean I have to fall in love and sleep with them just because they can relate to my situation? Come on, that's silly.
I liked the acting, the look, the subtlety of details, and I liked the humour - which doesn't manifest itself in the usual Hollywood Ha-Ha kind of way. Also, the humour is not constant; the latter part of the movie is not nearly as amusing as the classic Murray reactionary humour of the first half, so please, don't expect the ""Best Comedy of the Year"". It's not that kind of movie.
I read a lot of reviews when the movie was released of people who struggled with the ending calling it 'sad', 'cheap', 'inappropriate', 'unfulfilling' etc. Hmm. I don't know what they were expecting. Let's just say there is no real 'ending' in the traditional movie sense. The final exchange between Bob and Charlotte is left open-ended. I, for one, thought it was the perfect ending. Anything more dramatic would have felt out of place. And besides, I was able to fill in the blanks myself. It's nice when movies let the audience do that.
Still, despite all my good feelings towards Lost in Translation, there are flaws. Some people liked the music, but there were several moments in my mind, where that damn music gets spread on too thick. Soft and tinkly one minute, loud and annoying the next. What are we trying to communicate here? Any thing at all? The other thing is that Sofia Coppola (the director) lets the camera linger a wee bit too long on some shots. How many times do we have to see Charlotte sitting on her 100th floor high windowsill overlooking the city? We get the picture.
Anyway, it's got some flaws, and it's easy to point them out when - as a viewer - you're so used to being given a certain amount of information either visually or verbally. Well, Lost in Translation doesn't fill in all the gaps for you. But it's worth a rental (I bought it), because it doesn't do things by the book, which is a good thing, and lest I forget, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are excellent.",1077580800,3,3670,4.613149847094801

The acting was unmoving and stiff - though I can't really blame the actors, as the script offers nothing at all to work with.  Very limited dialogue combined with poorly developed, unsympathetic characters and a frustrating lack of coherent direction makes this movie drag unlike any other film I have ever experienced.
I kept fighting the urge to shut it off, thinking that at some point SOMETHING vaguely interesting or entertaining would happen, but it continued to drag on and on, aimlessly, mindlessly...
Then, mercifully, it ended.  My wife picked up the DVD and threw it in the trash without a word to me about it.
This is ABSOLUTELY an instance of Hollywood hyping a movie and the general public flocking to it and pretending to like it because they think it is supposed to be good.  PLEASE save yourself the disappointment and don't waste your time.",1077580800,9,1255,4.502202643171806

Kieslowski's films are also rather slow moving, as are most European cinema YET they usually have something to say. THAT SAID, THIS FILM IS A PILE OF DUNG! Horrible, boring, no script at all, pointless, total purposeless, unfunny, uninteresting DUNG! As if Sophia's first film wasn't boring enough, she took out Kirsten Dunst and a handfull of teenage beauties and replaced them with Bill Murray (whom I usually love) and the fat lipped, creaky voiced, bare bummed, Johannson. HORRIBLE FILM, 2 hours of my life wasted never to return.",1077580800,9,642,5.066037735849057

What does he need to find a more meaningful existence, for more self-fulfillment.  She has made what seems to be a bad marriage, with a man whose entry to the world means passing through mindless no-talent personalities, and denegrating his wife . . . what does she need for self-fullfillment.  The choice of Japan with fake dinosaurs flashing on the screen, with ersatz Western parties and Western style clubs and Western style everything else gives us a picture of incinserity that parallels the lives of the two main characters.  This movie portrays a slice of life, that is perhaps more genuine than so many other attempts.  These two don't jump into bed with each other, no overt voiolence . . just an almost overbearing sadness where one would expect something a bit more uplifting . . . and it can happen to people of any age.",1077580800,2,1002,4.638418079096045
1507058,5,B00005JMJ4,"Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a faded American action-movie hero visiting Tokyo -- courtesy of a $2 million dollar check -- to film commercials for Suntori liquors.  Spending a week camped out in a luxury hotel he soon meets 25 year-old, American Charlotte (played beautifully by Scarlett Johansson).  Her photog husband is off gallivanting around the country on various shoots.  These two lonely Americans, often unable to sleep or shake off the very 'foreigness' of Japan, soon find interesting company in each other.  She is bright, a Yale philosophy graduate, who is struggling with her role in life.  He is -- at heart -- a washed-up actor, uncomfortable in his long-standing marriage.  Together they encounter more of Japan than either would have alone.
The mysterious ending is wonderful... and open to many interpretations.  Coppola has done a masterful job both telling a story and weaving beautiful cinematography into a cohesive whole.  Photographed languidly, at a pace that captures a week of both characters' lives, you will revisit the story repeatedly in your mind.  And that's the mark of an exceptional screenplay.",1077580800,3,1130,5.198895027624309
1507059,2,B00005JMJ4,"I recently saw ""Lost In Translation"" and found the movie to be rather boring to say the least. Bill Murray, who plays an over-the-hill actor, apparently is going thru a midlife crisis and travels to Tokyo, Japan to do some vodka commercials. While there he becomes bored staying in his hotel and happens to begin a friendship with a young lady (Scarlett Johannson) who is also bored in her hotel room. Her husband is a photographer and he leaves her everyday to be left alone. Granted the two are lonely, but in a huge city like Tokyo? I'd be busy shopping than anything else (certainly my wife would), I doubt anyone could be bored living in a city so full of excitement. Murray's acting is just so so, I'm used to seeing him in funny films, and Johannson's acting skills are, well limited. The dialog in ""Lost In Translation"" is terrible. Quite frankly I've read some of the five star reviews for this film and I just can't see what was so great about the film. I'm giving the film a two star review for it's shots of Japan.",1077494400,9,1026,4.4338624338624335
1507060,5,B00005JMJ4,"I absolutely adore this film.  When I saw ""lost in translation"" in the theaters a few months back, I couldn't believe the transformation of funnyman Bill Murray into a serious, middle aged man.  The part could not have been played better, or by anyone else.  The story of the film is quite simple, a man (murray) travels over to japan to shoot a couple vodka commericals in hopes of making a decent dollar.  He's married, and yet unsatisfied and doesn't know where to turn.  Enter scarlet johannson, who plays a newleywed that has the same feelings over her own marriage.  Her husband is too transfixed in his photography career that they hardly spend much time together.  It is only a matter of time before the two souls meet and begin to converse on how they are standing.
Really a beautiful film, and astonishing to note that it took just under 4 weeks to film.  Sophia Coppola really displayed an amazing effort, directing, writing, and I believe producing the film.  There is no doubt this film belongs in my top 10 favorites, if not the top 5.  Hey, I'm a nice man, maybe I can sneak it into my top 3.  You would have no idea what you are missing if you calmly skip over this film.  The character development is astonishing, the characters know when to be serious, know when comic relief is sorely needed.

1507136,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is a truely memorable movie.
There seems to be some talk about it being racist against japanese.
I would take fault with that... its not about American/English superiority over Japanese, its about the incredible feeling of lonelyness you feel when you're thrust into another culture, for purposes other then pleasure. If anyone has been on a work trip to Mexico, France, Japan or Germany, or if you're not from an English country, taking a business trip to the USA is the same.
The scenes with the shower, the evelvator, the directors ... these scenes to me don't laugh at being japanese, they're about how these differences are obsticals that Bob just doesn't have the energy to deal with.
When you're on business in another culture, there's just nothing to do when you're just too tired from work to handle the translation, miss-communication or even the TV that you can't understand, the Radio that only plays a few songs you know. If you want to try to feel like it, go home tonight and after the long drive, turn on a TV channel you can't understand, find youself a magazine that's not in your language, sit by yourself on the bed, doing/reading/listening/watching nothing, see how long you last. For myself and people I know, you end up staying entirely in the hotel bar talking to the only waiter that speaks english.
This movie shows that the only time Bob and Charlotte ever get to enjoy being in Japan is when they're together. When they have someone to joke with (even share the bad dirty joke), to play with and to talk with. Its only then can you deal with bridging the communication gap. The scenes with their night out in Tokyo together show this perfectly. Just having someone to go back to, share what you've learned, talk about what was weird, what was great, that is what's important.
This is a movie about context, its about how powerful cultural context can be, how much we desire to be with someone, anyone that we can relate to.

1507141,5,B00005JMJ4,"People who give this film  1 star or wish they could give it negative stars need to either start watching movies or stop writing reviews.
I can understand if something doesn't jibe with certain people's sensibilities, but COME ON!!  ENOUGH WITH THE ""WORST MOVIE EVER MADE"" cliche.  ""Dude, Where's my Car?"" is a piece of crap; so is ""Troll 2"".  ""Lost in Translation"" is nowhere near this category.
Life is indeed full of long moments of quiet reflection with very little action.  The moments that are important are what creates the stories of our lives.  But by portraying the dead time in between these moments, Coppola makes a piece of art that's not simply there to stimulate bodily nerves (Which I think was her reason for showing Scarlett's ass in the begin, just to fool you morons into thinking that there would be plenty of tang to go around) but to make you think and contemplate the boredom and loneliness in your own lives.
Get this notion of ""entertainment"" out of your heads, kiddies. The great films don't simply entertain.  You don't read ""Hamlet"" or ""Leaves of Grass"", or listen to Mozart just to be entertained.  You do it because it moves you on some level buried deep inside where your conscious mindset can't see it.  That's why we're capable of falling head-over-heals in love with someone in a dream only to wake up and realize we never lived that life at all; Or you can have the capacity to find beauty in the simplest of objects right outside your very window without needing that simple objects to give you a lap dance; or you can have an intimate connection with someone without sex and without ever seeing that person again. These feelings stem from the source and is created in the form of ""art"", and it's the artists job to tap into these unknown realms that seem strange to every untrained and unimpassioned slob who dares call this ""The worst movie ever made.""
All slobs who sit around and let the television think for them have to drain the silicon out of their minds and get off their sex-saturated materialistic asses for half a second, and realize that these higher states of being do exist in the world.

1507254,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is a great film!  A lot of the reviewers here don't like it for two main reasons:  they thought it was a comedy and it's NOT, and/or they didn't like the way it depicted Japanese culture.
First, I'm going to address those two things.  It was marketed as a comedy-- big mistake.  Although I laughed at times, this movie is a subtle exploration of two people out of there norms, lonely, and -- well, ""lost"" is the right word.  It is absolutely not a comedy and it's too bad that the guys who market these things tried to make it out as one.  Now about all you people who think it's all racist or whatever-- I think it's quite obvious that it's not trying to put Japanese in a bad light, and I also don't think it does.  It simply portrays them in the way that most Americans would relate to if they were there.  The main characters are American and the sotry is about them and how they view things.  Like in the elevator, Bill Murray is the tallest guy there and he's not a tall guy by our standards.  Two of my firends who have been to Japan said ""oh my God I know exaclty how that feels.""  When the Japanese try to speak English and get some of the L's and R's wrong--well, they do get it wrong.  The movie didn't make you laugh about that, it just said that they do that.  A lot of people just happened to think it's funny.  It's not necessarily funny, but it is necessarily accurate.  I know if I was trying to talk Japanese a lot of people would be laughing at me!  Also, I thought it did many things to portray Japanese positively.  I can't name specific things off hand, but I did think all the Japanese characters were very fun and interesting and the movie made me want to visit Japan, which I previously had absolutely no desire to do.
Now then, back to the movie.  It's a wonderful movie!  The part of Bob must have been written specificly for Bill Murray because he is absolutely amazing.  I don't know how to describe it any better than that.  The girl, whose name I know but know I will mispell it, also did a fantastic job in her role.  So basically, good casting.  It was also a very fun movie for just identifying with loneliness and hoping to connect.  And although there's that romantic aspect of meeting a stranger in an exotic place and there is some sexual tension because they are different sexes, the movie is about friendship.  I really liked that fact.  It has been a long damn time since a movie had two characters that weren't the same sex and didn't get it on.  The only thing that kind of pissed me off was the fact that, without ruining it for somebody who hasn't seen it, sex was the thing Sofia chose to be the event that it was (no the characters didn't do it) rather than having something else serve that purpose, since the relationship between the two main characters was about friendship and not necessarily romantic.  But it was forgiven when they also came to that conclusion during the fire alarm, and it also brought up the question about if guys and girls really be just friends.
I hope I have cleared a few things up and given a decent review of the movie as a movie, unlike many reviewers.  I also hope that this helps those of you who don't knwo whether or not to see it.  Obviously it's not for everbody but I think it's a damn good movie and highly recommended.  (And it's certainly much better than the god aweful Virgin Suicides!)",1077408000,,3382,4.30379746835443

1507256,1,B00005JMJ4,"Tokyo is a bewildering city for foreigners, if only because of its sheer size and of course the language barrier. But this movie beats the culture shock theme like a dead horse and jams every Japan cliche into its 105 minutes. I read in an interview that Sofia Coppola has spent some time living in Tokyo, which I find astonishing since Lost in Translation doesn't demonstrate the astuteness or sensibility of someone familiar with the place. No, Japanese are not uniformly short and not everything on Japanese TV is a wacky variety show (or b/w Kurosawa classic). And there are not many Japanese who speak otherwise decent English, but still confuse ""l"" and ""r"" sounds with such hilarity. I stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo last year, I'm 6'6"" and can attest that I had no issues with the height of my shower. If anything, I find Tokyo surprisingly accomodating for a person of tall stature, especially compared with other places in Asia. What can I say? This movie is total exaggeration. Why on earth would Bill Murray's character take the girl to some non-descript hospital where no staff speak a word of English - when Tokyo is packed with medical facilities and services catering to expats? But aside from all this, the characters themselves are a bit unconvincing. I did not buy the girl as a Yale philosophy graduate considering the trite dialogue of the heart-to-heart sessions and i have never known any self-respecting philsophy graduate to listen to self-improvement audio tapes. And Bill Murray's character, married 25 years but only just experiencing the monotony of married life with a young kid. Then there's the photographer husband (he seems about 18 years old) and a vain actress, neither really developed to any extent, and several token Japanese for flavor. It baffles me why this movie has received such acclaim.",1077408000,18,1834,4.90032154340836
1507343,4,B00005JMJ4,"So i heard that Sofia Coppola had a new movie comin out.. Immediately I my ears perked up... wasn't too keen on Bill Murray at first.. but hey..  I loved what she did with the Virgin Suicides, and the score especially..
Eventually saw the movie...wow..  a friend of mine said it was slow..so i went in with that expectation..  it's slow if you have a short attention span, or expect a car to explode every two minutes.. if that's you're thing this isn't for you..
nawh, I'm kidding about the attention span :-)
it's not an action flick,though..
someone said it was a boring film about two boring people, who double their boredom.. they were RIGHT.. a film about two real people being people, and done in such a lovely way.. It was funny, in a poignant way.. i don't see where the racism accusations come in..  anyhow.. it didn't feel contrived at any point, unlike some other movies(too many to list right now)
Bill changed my original thoughts of him in the movie.. he was superb! the on-screen chemistry between the two is tangible, and i shall definetly be on the watch for her career.
bottom line.. great movie,with a great soundtrack..  Sofia has an eye (and an ear) for great cinema...
it's a bit quirky at times ( due to the culture shock ) and a bit mundane ( the short snippets of conversation when they meet)  but highly enjoyable..
oh and i LOVE the 'style b' poster, with Scarlet Johansson in the
Tokyo traffic, with the dinosaur scrolling across the building , and all the neon.
Sofia Coppola is one of my favourite directors;granted she only has two films, but I patiently await her next project, whatever that may be.",1077408000,5,1632,4.552901023890785
1507344,5,B00005JMJ4,"I did not know what to expect when I finally saw this movie.  I had read so many rave reviews in the newspapers and watched critics say it was one of the best films of the year...I was convinced that I had to watch this movie.
When I finally started watching it I kept expecting something funny to happen, after all, Bill Murray is one of the funniest actors alive (Groundhog Day, King Pin), but it wasn't funny.  So immediately I said to myself, what a jip!  He won the golden Globe award for best actor in a Comedy?  But this isn't a comedy! I thought.
By this time I was bored and turned it off only 10 minutes into the movie.  But I was determined to watch it through so I played it again the next day and forced myself to sit through it.  What I ended up watching was one of the best films I have ever seen!
The story is not funny at all..It's actually sad...very depressing...But beautiful at the same time.  It's about this middle-aged actor (Bill Murray) and a young married woman (Scarlet Johansen) who are drawn to each other.  They are 2 Americans in Tokyo, and they movie shows them throughout the movie getting to know each other in this foreign place, and being alone in the world.  It might be, they both realize, that they may be each other's soulmates, but the fact that loneliness is not a calamity but fate for these two surpass their feelings.  This movie makes you cry at the end, and I seldom cry.
I still think that Bill Murray's best performance was in Groundhog Day, but I am very happy that he has been nominated for an Oscar for this film.  Usually these awards are not just for the sole movie they are nominated for, but for the body of their work...Take John Travolta when he won the Oscar for Pulp Fiction, for example!  I think Bill Murray should beat Sean Penn for best actor this year (2004).  I like Sean Penn a lot, (and I still think Sean Penn's best movie was Bad Boys-1982), but over all, Bill Murray was more effective in Lost in Translation than Sean Penn in Mystic River.",1077408000,2,2012,4.319148936170213
1507345,5,B00005JMJ4,"i will start off by saying, i absolutely loved this movie.  that being said i will leave a disclaimer...this movie is not, i repeat, NOT for everyone.  this is a movie that revolves around two people who find themselves in japan for different reasons.  this movie is first and foremost a character study.  it has funny parts, it has dramatic parts, but mainly it is a look into the life of two people.
that having been said, if you like rich and vivid characters you may find yourself liking this movie.  bill murray plays an aging actor who finds himself in japan filming a commercial for whiskey (something we find him drinking often!).  scarlett johansson plays a character who travels to japan with her husband.  we find her character wandering japan quite a bit as her husband (brilliantly played by giovanni ribisi) is a very busy photographer.
both johansson and murray are absolutely great in this film.  they play the characters with a passion that is rarely seen in films (at least in my humble opinion) today.  we have seen flashes of greatness from murray (ex. rushmore) but he has never been as on top of his game as he is here.  and although johansson is basically a newcomer, she plays the part with a style and grace rarely found in actresses of her age.
again, i will note that this is not a movie that everyone will enjoy, in fact most people will probably be bored by it.  but, if you are looking for two outstanding performances, and a movie that hits character development full on, then watch soffia copola's ""lost in translation!""",1077321600,4,1552,4.627737226277373
1507346,4,B00005JMJ4,"I enjoyed this movie for a number of reasons.  First, it is so wonderful to have a film about actual people moving through something approaching a real life on the road overseas.  If you've ever traveled on business in a different culture you will recognize how this actually feels and how it intensifies the stage of life in which the two main characters find themselves.
Isn't it wonderful that there are NO explosions, no 'action', no murders, mayhem, or monsters?  Just actual human characters with failings and emotions.
Bill Murray does so much with such complexity and subtlety that my appreciation for him has grown even deeper.  Just a superb job.  Scarlett Johansson is also quite special and memorable in this role.  There is a pair of scenes that epitomizes what these two pull off together (there are many more wonderful scenes than this example).  They are just before and just after Bill Murray is forced to open his door when he doesn't want to and Scarlett Johansson is on the other side wanting to ask him to lunch and he wants to go, but he can't just then and she understands why.  His embarrassment and disgust with himself and her disappointment, hurt, and let down is sad but a wonderful scene to behold.  They pull this off with a power that distills real life.
The film seems to work hard for its R rating.  The image over the opening title seemed unnecessary to me as well as the scene where he meets her briefly in a strip club and the drug references also seem tangential.  The core of the story doesn't hang on any of these things.  This is an adult film not because of the images, or sex, or drugs.  It is an adult film because of the deep, complex, and subtle emotions it evokes in dealing with the pain the protagonists lives and the friendship that flowers for them in their exotic setting.
It really is a touching and powerful film with some quite humorous moments.",1077321600,7,1899,4.566371681415929

1507349,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is honestly one of the best films of 2003 and even the critics, who loved it, agree.  Its something different from the usual film.  Lost in Translation centers around lonliness, the longing to belong, and cultural differeces which can cause some problems.  Bill Murray is fantastic as the aging actor Bob Harris.  He fills the character with a charm that you cannot get enough of.  Bill Murray really does deserve the Best Actor Oscar.  Scarlett Johansson is awesome as a neglected wife who finds joy in life when she meets Bob Harris.  She really should have gotten a Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress nomination.  Last, but not least, to mention is Sofia Coppla.  As the director, she did a great job and it shows with all the hype that has surrounded the film.
Bob Harris WAS a movie actor.  Now as his popularity has fallen in America, he is hired in Japan, where he is still a star, to shoot commercials and photos for Suntory, a whiskey company.  He is obviously not having a good time due to frequent calls and complaints from his wife and the lack of sleep. Charolette has come to Japan with her photographer husband and spends almost all of her time in the hotel.  She is lonely from the lack of excitement around her and the neglect she gets from her husband, who cares more about his job.
The two meet when Charolette is dining with her husband and his actress friend who is a complete-never-stops-talking moron.  She has a brief conversation with him and we feel the warmth.  At their next meeting, she invites him to go see her Japanese friends with her.  With this experience with see how well they connect and we wish we had the same thing with someone.
Lost in Translation is a fantastic film that is funny and somewhat sad at the same time.  This is a great movie that everyone should see because it is so enjoyable.  Bill Murray truly rocks and is so alluring with his comidic and dramatic acting.  See this movie.",1077321600,4,1958,4.545714285714285
1507350,4,B00005JMJ4,"As good as the movie is, it almost feels like a fluke that ""Lost in Translation"" found so much success. Since its release, this story about a middle-aged actor and a young newlywed who form a bittersweet friendship during their stay in Tokyo, topped just about every critic's Ten Best lists for 2003; it made a pile of money; and it's been nominated for most of the major Academy Awards.
That's a heavy weight for a little movie to bear and ""Lost"" is a little movie. It's the kind of fragile, off-beat sleeper that usually falls beneath the mainstream radar: It has a slow pace, an odd structure and hardly any story at all; it's funny but not quite a comedy, sad but not quite a drama. The main characters, played by Scarlett Johansson and the recently Oscar nominated Bill Murray, are sympathetic but cold to everyone except each other, and they're both moping around a mighty fine five-star hotel.
So now that ""Lost"" has been released on DVD to a much wider audience, will it face a backlash from viewers who watch it expecting too much and wonder, ""What's the big deal?""

Many of the reviews here indicate a ""yes"" in answer to that question, which seems a shame because ""Lost,"" while not exactly your typical crowd-pleaser, is a subtle modern classic.
Viewers who haven't seen it but have heard the massive hype surrounding it should keep their expectations in check and focus on the movie's simple pleasures: a careful script by writer-director Sofia Coppola; beautiful cinematography by Lance Acord; and a great, Bogart-esque performance by Murray - aside from possibly (possibly) Al Pacino, I can't think of a fifty-something actor other than Murray who could pull off the character's complicated mix of humor and seriousness.
I actually found that ""Lost"", with its lonely characters and late night settings, improves on home video.  It's a movie best suited to watching alone in the wee small hours of the morning, and its ending left me feeling a nostalgia usually reserved for movies like ""Before Sunrise"" and ""American Graffiti.""",1077321600,2,2040,4.859195402298851

A female lead who is far too young (and indecisive by nature) for anyone to actually believe she's married (let alone for 2 years and to a dude she obviously can't stand)... a male lead who's been married for 25 years, yet has a young son and a baby daughter... a female lead who is, essentially, a blob... a male lead whom we are supposed to care about, despite the fact that he forgets his son's birthday and describes having children as if it's the worst thing that will ever happen to you... the requisite contrived, nagging wifey back home... a female lead who seems to be alone and lost in a foreign city she's never been to, yet suddenly half way through the film has close friends who barely speak her language and are middle-aged... a male lead who apparently, and with no explanation, has ESP (how else would he know which room she was staying in when she invites him to go out on the town with her?)... oh, and don't forget to add some borderline racism and one joke over and over about how Japanese people switch their ""R's"" and ""L's"" in place of actual humor...

1507419,5,B00005JMJ4,"Amidst the various Best Picture Oscar contenders this year lies two hidden treasures most likely to be overlooked for the greater presence exuded by The Return of the King, Master and Commander and Seabiscuit. The two treasures are Mystic River and Lost In Translation.

Yes, the movie may run incredibly slow at times, is seldom upbeat and even without any significant climax. Then why was this movie able to shine. It's really the good combination of good acting and directing. Hemled by second time director, Sophia Coppola (incidentally also nomianted for Best Director and Best Screenplay), she was very much able to explore and bring out the inner struggles of two helplessly souls in a foreign land. The director deliberately makes use of the slow pace to showcase the development of a great platonic friendship between the most unlikely of couples.

The special effect here is really the superb performance by the two leads. The sweetly innocent Scarlett Johansson puts on excellent portrayal of a lost wife stuck in the monotony of a seemingly aimless marriage. Bill Murray, nomianted for a Best Actor Oscar, is convincing as a has-been actor making a quick buck in Japan trying to promote Japanese beer. Dejected and totally indifferent most of the time, his world suddenly lights up when he meets a transient soulmate. Both married to others but still can't find the fulfilment they want in life. It's ultimately about the power of silence and how greatly it wrecks relationships. It's also about how amazing relationships can develop no matter how strange the situation is or the people are.

It's a good while since such great human drama has ben played on screens withou the need for steamy sex scenes or extreme violence. In my heart, this is already the Best Picture of 2003!",1077235200,3,1791,4.943521594684386
1507420,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is definately one of this year's best films, but the Focus Features DVD release is far from perfect.
The film is a delightful work with a script that touches the heart and the funnybone. Murray's performance is excellent and he manages to even outdue his work in Rushmore. Johansson's work is stunning and she manages to match Murray note for note throughout the picture. By being able to pair off with Murray in such an equal manner, the relationship that developes is so much more engrossing. After watching Lost in Translation, the thing that struck me the most was the uncanny mood that the film creates. This mood lingered with me long after I had left the theater. It doesn't take a trip to Japan to become lost in the translation of everyday life.
The worst problem with the DVD is the forced previews. This is the first disc I've ever owned where you couldn't just push the menu button to skip the previews. I don't even think skipping the track works. The previews actually were for decent films, but seeing this everytime you put in the disc is really annoying.
Video quality is good, but not great. Color and contrast were okay. Shimmering was not a problem. Unfortunately the picture seemed pretty soft. Although the cinematography tends to push an intended hazy look, there we some shots that seemed almost blurry that I don't recall looking this way in the theater. Beware there is a fullscreen version out there. There is no excuse for getting that because the film is shot in 1:85:1, so no matter how small your TV is your picture is going to be larger enough. I can understand, but don't condone the purchase of full screen editions for films shot in wider aspect ratios, because on a small TV the picture is barely visible.
Sound was quite good. There are many intriguing sound edits in the picture and the track was of good quality. Be sure to listend to the manipulation of the music when Murray carries Johansson back to her room.
Extras were a mixed bag. The interview with Murray and Coppola is very strange. It is shot in Rome on top of a building and the whole time Coppola barely speaks and Murrary's shadow covers her. Murray is straight forward and doesn't joke around. It is not very enlightening. The Behind the Scenes documentary is over long with lots of dull spots, but there are several enjoyable moments in it. For one thing Murray is hilirious and his off screen antics are a riot. The music video is boring, watching someone doing nothing but walk around Tokyo for an entire song gets tiresome, even if it's Scarlett! The deleted scenes are mostly extensions that add little, but be sure to check the robot scene. This scene is very weird, but totally fits with the mood of the film, too bad it didn't make the cut. There is also an extended clip of Murray on the ""Johnny Carson of Japan"" show. This is a riot, check out what Murray does with the ""surprise"" he finds in the box.
Lost in Translation is a great film, maybe not a classic, but time will tell. Coppola has proved herself as a skilled filmmaker and has removed the sting of her performance in Godfather III. Johansson has the potential of being a great movie star of the future as long as she continues to select quality projects like this. The Focus Features DVD has an okay transfer that is rather soft with average extras and a terrible set of unavoidable previews before the picture starts.",1077235200,3,3413,4.587561374795417

1507422,4,B00005JMJ4,"I desperately wanted to see this movie after seeing the glowing reviews.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  By now everyone knows it's a story of Bill Murray, the aging star in Japan to make a lucrative commercial, and Scarlett Johansson as a young, unfulfilled wife.
Much has been made of Murray's performance, but frankly, I don't see the excitement.  He's basically playing Bill Murray and his enjoyable dry wit but there is absolutely no new ground broken here and no stretch required to play the role.  If anything, he underacted.
Scarlett Johansson is another matter.  For such a young star she is able to convey her inner self with the slightest blank look.  I predict a long and very successful career.
I left the theater feeling very unfulfilled.  Could the press and nepotism in Hollywood account for the hype of this film?  Was it the intellectual's desire to tell us what we would enjoy?  Or is this another Coppola masterpiece? All I knew is when I left, I was bored and depressed.  But over the next two days, I continually revisited the haunted Scarlett Johansson character.  Does she divorce?  Does she ever get happy?  Does she see Murray again?  DOES SHE FINALLY GET OUT OF JAPAN?  And that's what makes the film worth the trip.  when an actor/screenwriter/director can make you think.
Entertaining movie?  Not really.  Thought provoking?  Yes!",1077235200,,1358,4.87719298245614
1507423,2,B00005JMJ4,"Probably the most overrated film of the year.  A good word for this movie is DULL, because it goes nowhere fast.  Bill Murray is a has-been actor from the states filming a commercial in Japan.  While there and bored he meets Scarlett Johansson, who is also bored.  They get together and are bored together.  Its contagious and quickly spread to the audience.  Not sure what the buzz is about.  Murray's talent is clearly wasted here.

I thought with an original title like 'Lost in Translation, a talented cast headed by Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and Giovanni Ribisi and a Coppola directing it, what could go wrong? Well in my view, from the moment that the film's dialogue started, it just went awry.
'Lost in Translation' centers around 2 neglected Americans who become drawn to each other because of their mutual loneliness and their need to find themselves. Bill Murray plays a has-been actor who feels more loved in Japan than in his native land. He sees Johansson often in their hotel, she plays an educated, young and married woman who feels neglected by her husband, a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi). These 2 characters become attracted to each other on a strictly platonic level at first but one begins to question that as the film continues. So far, so good, right? Wrong.
My main qualm about this film that makes me give it 2 stars is the fact that this film is blatantly patronising to the Japanese: the constant, patronising and derisive comments uttered by Bill Murray made me think - Has Hollywood come to this? Do you need to make fun of people's accents and culture to gain an Oscar nod and laughs from expatriates?
Even without the condescending remarks to the Japanese, the pace of the film is slow and worn out. You want to find out whether the 2 characters do have any genuine feelings for each other or whether it is platonic, but the film does not offer a platform for their feelings or their appreciation for each other to develop.

During those five minutes, you may fast forward, but you can't skip track or go directly to menu.

1507532,5,B00005JMJ4,"One of the most thoughtful and beautiful movies I've seen in the past year. Coppola is clearly an observant writer and director. There are several little fascinating, yet unexplained observations of life in modern Japan (the traditional wedding party and the Tokyo video arcade are good examples). These scenes are engaging because we are also engaged by the two main characters who are stumbling through this strange world, even as they are discovering a soul mate in each other.
The photography is beautiful. One of my favorite compositions is a shot of Murray driving a golf ball off a tee with a beautiful mountain backdrop (Mt. Fuji maybe?) In another eye-filling scene, Johansson meanders through a park filled with ribboned trees, and stepping stone ponds. Scenic nature is nice, but even better is the urban atmosphere of Tokyo. Both the interior and exterior shots are interestingly composed and lit. The hotel and taxi scenes were evocative, reminding me of Polanski's ""Frantic"", another jet-lagged, fish-out-of-water movie. (The only scene I could have done without was strip club scene, but it was mercifully short.)
There is great writing and acting as well. There are interesting read-between-the-lines conversations several times; like when Murray meets a couple American businessmen in the hotel bar. And the unspoken expressive acting between the two when they go out for a silent lunch after he disappoints her was also very well done. If you like dialogue and character development, this movie's for you.
Since the two main characters comment often about not being able to sleep, it's tempting to call the movie `Sleepless in Tokyo'. But while I like the Seattle movie, the similarities aren't that many. It's just a good pun. Why this movie is categorized as a comedy I'm not sure. Murray is very funny, but in an understated way. And the movie is much deeper than most comedies I see. Maybe I'm just biased against the word `comedy' because so many of them don't appeal to my taste. This movie appealed to me in so many ways. I heartily recommend it.",1077235200,,2071,4.988439306358382

Instead of joining the lemmings who praise this utter yawner, call it what it is: BOOOOORRRRRIIINNNGG.  Dull, dull, dull, and not even close to what it's made out to be.
I'm a big fan of Bill Murray, but to call him Oscar worthy is nothing short of a travesty.  My only moment of levity (in between the yawns) was in the karaoke scene where Murray starts to sing--sounded just like his character Ned the Lounge Lizard from SNL days.  Very one dimensional.
Johannson at least shows she has talent, but considering the sleep-walk everyone else in this movie took, most anyone could stand out with even a minor amount of emotion.
Far and away the biggest disappointment I've seen in the past couple years, especially given the hoopla.  Was everyone else given a different video, and I only saw the out-takes?",1077235200,11,1102,4.723958333333333

It was kind of racist after I thought about it.  Japanese surfers...she seemed like she was trying to make a spoof of this.  She was basically commenting on the whole japanese culture in this movie, thats all it really was.  The characters where there just for her comments on japanese culture.
The love between the two characters was the reason I watched it.  The development of their love seemed plastic and pushed.  Yes, they were two strangers needing a partner in a time when they were alone.  Everyone understands this.  The problem lies in the development of their love.  The Karaoke scenes were good but the rest of the interaction and dialogue was pretty much passe.  If this was supposed to be artistic and fresh, then show some new ideas about love.
I read somewhere how Coppola was ""true"" to her characters.  The characters didn't have much development opportunities so there was nothing to be true too.  They were kind of boring actually.  Bill Murray was funny, but the girl was vanilla plain.

Those of us with less tact use the word ""slow.""  This is also true; however, it is slow in a good way.  We might focus for a long time on Bill Murray squirming uncomfortably in a strip club without hearing a line of dialogue, but this speaks of his character, a middle-aged white American out of place in a foreign land.  The laughs are well earned and are due almost entirely to Bill Murray's talent as an actor.  The movie changes from being serious to funny and back without ever becoming pretentious.  If forced to put this movie into a category, I would call it a romantic comedy (the term gives me shivers), but the friendship between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson is pure.

1507619,4,B00005JMJ4,"You really know there is a serious flip-flop in the way Hollywood thinks now adays when one of the most highly anticipated films of the year is an ""art-house"" feature. Lost in Translation is the second directorial project from Sofia Coppola, the daughter of Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, after her critically praised debut, The Virgin Suicides. Another rising star associated with Translation, Scarlett Johansson, has given further interest in the project thanks to her powerful performances in other art-house films like The Man Who Wasn't There and Ghost World. But if one had to pick out only one aspect that raised the most eyebrows concerning this film, it would have to be the involvement of comedian actor Bill Murray, best known for his hilarious performances in Ghostbusters and Caddyshack. Can an actor who is so embedded in the public consciousness as a comedian pull off a powerful dramatic performance? Looking back to the past for reference, the answer lies between both yes (Robin Williams) and no (Jim Carrey).
The story focuses on separate lifes of a struggling actor and a young woman as they cross paths and discover that everybody wants to be found. Bob Harris was once a prosperous television star but that regal star lifestyle he once had has long since past as he currently reduced to promoting whiskey in Japan. At the same time, a young woman named Charlotte is tagging along with her photographer husband but feels totally out of place as he seems to be more focused on his work then her. Both Bob and Charlotte feel they have lost what they wanted in life and don't know where to go from here. Then one night, the two cross paths in the bar of the luxury hotel in which they are staying and from there spark up a surprising friendship together. In their time together, they discover the excitement they had thought they lost in their lives and break away from the despair that had once brought them down. The story for Lost in Translation is one that, if in the hands of another director, would have been mediocre fare but Coppola presents an atmospheric quality that keeps the feature interesting, yet at the same time thought provoking. The setting of the film in Japan is another stroke of genius considering the subject matter the feature deals with, that of necessity and happiness, which are values and topics greatly treasured in Japanese culture.
The cast for Translation is limited based on the number of performers but perhaps that is to its advantage as the story mainly focuses on the roles of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Though some questioned whether Bill Murray was qualified for this role based on his mostly comedic career, such doubts are quickly erased as he gives a memorable dramatic performance that is not without many comedic quips. Murray's deliverance of dialogue is rich with sarcasm and dark humor, which makes the performance all the more unforgettable. Scarlett Johansson gives yet another delightful performance, this time in the role of a lonely young woman who is searching for purpose in life. Johansson presents such a quality and charm about herself that one can't help but notice her where she is on screen. But it is the chemistry between Murray and Johansson enacted on the big screen that ends up complimenting both their separate performances and intensifies the overall emotional impact of the feature's story. There are few roles focused on outside of the previously mentioned duo but what is presented is a mixed bag of performances. Anna Faris, who portrays a good friend of Johansson's husband, presents as best of a performance as the material that is given to her and though her character emphasizes Charlotte's sense of loneliness with her husband caring more of her then his own wife, one begins to feel as though she is presented too much or there wasn't as much involvement with her as there could have been. The same goes to Giovanni Ribisi, Johansson's husband in the film, but at it was said before, they are not the focus of the feature and thus are less primary to the overall story, so there shouldn't be so much complaint.
Overall, Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is an art-house gem that shows that companionship can be found in the most unlikely of places and gives emotional hope for those looking for it. The feature's entire emotional emphasis rides on the chemistry of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson and it works exceedingly well, beyond what even the most star-studded major release this year has done, which gives further complimentary criticism to the duo. But, as with most films, along with the good comes the bad as well. As was said previously, the Japanese background compliments the story of the film exceptionally but at times there were awkward moments that weren't necessarily needed, such as the scene with Murray's character sitting alone in a Japanese strip club waiting for Charlotte. And the ending, though expected, left the audience with the lingering feeling of being a bit of a downer after such an emotionally uplifting story. But all-in-all, Lost in Translation rides on the shoulders of its leading stars to an emotional and fulfilling performance.",1077148800,8,5191,4.92018244013683

The effect of combining the ""in phase"" waves is addition - the amplitudes of the peaks are added together, thus greater than either one.  This is commonly called ""resonance.""  When the equal amplitude out-of-phase waves are added together, they cancel each other out.  This is known as ""destructive interference.""
I bring this up because this is what happens to viewers of ""Lost in Translation.""  If you are in phase with this movie - by personal experiences, then the low-key bemusement will strike a familiar chord.  If you have never had the experience of living out of a hotel - particularly a hotel in a non-English-speaking country, then this movie will probably strike you as extremely dull, and you ought to avoid it.
For those of you in the first camp - this movie connects at a fundamental level.  The ""hotel lighting"", background music, dimly lit lounges, exotic glimpses of day-to-day life all bring back memories not only of Japan, but of any country or place in which you are the alien.  The amazing thing is that Coppola accomplishes this without making the movie depressing.  While the specifics of the plot certainly weren't personally familiar, the context of the movie makes the plot somewhat irrelevant.
Murray & Johansson are most accomplished in their blending in: neither character stands out from the context of the movie.  Both are intrinsic to their settings.  And the effect of this is to make the separation of the two that much more affecting.
A marvelous, understated and powerful movie.  But don't bother unless you're on the same wavelength.",1077148800,2,1939,4.833333333333333
1507621,5,B00005JMJ4,"Let's get the gripe out of the way first: the trailer. The trailer for this movie cheeses it up and portrays it as some all-American family comedy, but it totally betrays the nature of the film. In fact its a dazzling audiovisual work of art, beautifully told, well acted, with intrigue, appeal and imagination. Scarlett Johanssen's character is so far removed from the average movie heroine that its wonderfully appealing and her journey is sentimental but never cheesy.
The film, sometimes just from the cinematography and/or music, can bring out completely inexpressible feelings. Talking of which, the soundtrack is great. Dazzling is a perfect word for it: Tokyo is stunning and alluring. The Japanese jokes can bely the real content of the film and we could possibly do without them, but they're immaterial to the film, really.

1507622,5,B00005JMJ4,"Two Americans visiting Tokyo meet: ""Lost in Translation"" is about the relationship that evolves between them, how they adjust to Japanese culture, and the disconnect between each and their respective spouses.
There are numerous scenes we see the disconnect between Japanese and Americans: Bob Harris towering over the Japanese men in the elevator,  Harris as a guest on the talk show, the prostitue that visits his hotel room, the misunderstandings that happen when the Japanese invert their L's and R's.
But note how often what is 'lost in translation' is between the Americans themselves.  Both Harris and Charlotte feel disconnected from their American, English-speaking spouses.
Lastly, I really enjoyed seeing a love story that didn't become sexual.  A bond occured between an older man and a young woman.  That is the love story, and it was a stronger love story than I've seen in most movies.",1077148800,,899,5.136986301369863

1507624,5,B00005JMJ4,"I am writing this review mostly in response to those who say it is boring and pointless.  Frankly, if a movie-watcher is looking for car crashes, watch Speed.  Lost in Translation is a movie that I might describe as ""dreamlike realism.""  It is a quiet film set in a noisy city.
Bill Murray plays a '70s action movie star who is Tokyo to film a commercial for whiskey.  In the early film, he undergoes an experience not unlike sensory deprivation.  He drinks alone in a bar listening to bad karaoke.  His commercial director speaks for twenty animated seconds and his translator gives him three words of meaningless direction.  He is an ocean away from a family that has forgotten him.  He is numb.  He is alone.
Scarlett Johansson plays the young wife of a hipster photographer who is forced to stay in the hotel during her husband's photo shoots around the country.  She listens to self-help tapes in her hotel room.  She swims alone in the large hotel pool.
The film is about how these two souls that are floating aimlessly and blindly in our ultra-modern world connect in a way we don't usually see on film.  Even though they must be at least thirty years apart in age (a fact the director Sofia Coppola uses to accent the improbability of the events), they form a bond that begins perhaps because they understand each other's pain.  But how it develops is what makes this movie so special.
In a world where all of us probably feel alone in some way despite all the technology that connects us and supposedly makes our lives easier, we can root for these two lost souls to find each other and with that, find happiness.
The cinematography and the direction is breathtaking also.  The scenes are never rushed, and, along with the ethereal music, this gives the film its dreamlike quality.  The scene where Scarlett Johansson's character takes a sightseeing trip by herself was an especially powerful one for me.
Overall, I can't say enough good things about this film.  It was the best movie I've seen in a long time.  Just don't watch it expecting Guy Ritchie to have done the editing and the Wachowski brothers to have choreographed the fight scenes.",1077062400,11,2154,4.656084656084656

Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are great as the two lonely people trying to connect with themselves and the outside world, and we, the viewer are taking though this journey with them and are intrigued with their misadventures together.

I have watched this film both in the theater and dvd and I like this movie better now than I did at the theater, and I liked it at the theater allot.
This film just shows me what can be done, when a smart director takes her time to develop characters which we learn to care about. Lets face it, this film is not about much. Two people stuck in a hotel in the urban sprawl of Tokyo, isolated by language and their lives. Two people who, under normal circumstances would never meet and have little in common. Yet they connect and share a few moments in their lives that they shall take with them the rest of their days.
This film is smart. Very smart because again it is really about very little and yet it kept my attention to the very last second. Bill Murray is wonderful. He never over plays this roll, not for a moment. Just when you think he may take it too fare he reals himself in and stays in character. He is funny at times, but conveys a man very tired with his life and his place in it.
Scarlet Johnasson is great. A star in the making. The chemistry is there between her and Murray even though there must be 30 plus years difference in their ages.
I liked the fact that unlike most Hollywood films they never end up hooking up in bed. That would have been to common and this was not a common film. We feel the characters much more so when they do not get together in any sexual way. It was almost as if the characters were too special to sleep together(for sex) and that helped lift the acting and the film above the common love story churned out these days.
But to me the best and most outstanding moment is the end when Murray chases Johnasson down on the Tokyo street and you realize in that final meeting together how special he thinks she is. I am glad we do not hear what they say to each other. But I can only guess it would be something touching, and sincere just as this film was.
Lost in Translation is a film for those who have felt
lonely in a crowd of people ,and yet found something up lifting to carry them over the emptiness. A wonderful movie.",1077062400,3,2091,4.178217821782178
1507720,3,B00005JMJ4,"I only give this DVD 3 stars because the DVD presentation is fairly bad. The Focus Features advertisement at the beginning has to be fast forwarded through. I couldn't switch audio presentations during the film; Dolby had a light crackle in the right rear speaker (maybe just my system, but DTS didn't have it). When I did switch to DTS I couldn't resume the movie where I left off, I had to use the scene selection to get back to where I was. The list goes on. Extras are nice but the only thing I would have liked would be a commentary track by the stars and/or the director. I thought this movie was out kind of soon on DVD, and now I see that they may have rushed things. I have rarely been this disappointed in the DVD presentation of a movie I've liked so much. Collectors may want to wait for a better presentation.
The movie is excellent. Issues aside, once you hit play it's about the film.",1077062400,4,899,4.294117647058823
1507721,3,B00005JMJ4,"This is a frustrating film for me.  I LOVE Bill Murray. He always entertains me, no matter how small a part he has in a film.  And again, he is fantastic in this one.
They had a great idea going here.  Yes, two lonely people with insomnia in a strange city who connect.  But they really have no meaningful experiences together.  They hop through a bunch of ecstasy parties with her weird friends.  This alone doesn't work for me.
  'Bob' is clearly in his mid-fifties.  No matter how 'cool' he may be, (even for Bill Murray) he would feel totally out of place with those twirps.
  I know that they are trying to do an 'artsy','hip' film here (gotta keep up with current hollywood standards), but they had a great idea which to me seemed very undeveloped.  A little bit of storyline would have been good, even if it ain't hip these days.  I got bored watching them do nothing but watch their friends party for what seemed like 40 minutes.

1507722,5,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray turns in his strongest performance as Bob Harris, a once-popular American actor who is travelling to Tokyo, Japan to shoot a commercial. Bob knows that he has been almost not heard of by the young generation in his country, and no longer spoken of by the generation who once loved his films. He gets more praise and respect from the people in Japan. When he first arrives at the hotel in Tokyo, he is greeted and treated by some of the strangest and often hilarious characters as you'll see. He sits continually in the bar staring into space, waiting out his time to go home.
On the other side of the fence is Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte, a mysterious young woman who is half Bob's age, who he begins to fixate on and she on him. Charlotte is married to a youthful and famous photographer working on an important shoot in Tokyo, and so she spends her days (like Bob), staring out into space - searching for something that will never come in that image she stares at. It seems like every time Bob and Charlotte step out of their rooms, somehow they see each other...whether it be in the elevator, in the swimming pool hall, or at the bar...they see each other. Soon, they realize that each of them are looking for pretty much the same thing: life. When Charlotte asks Bob to come with her to meet a few friends, the two come together like pages in a book being binded. At first, it simply seems like a harmless, strong friendship, but in reality, both know that it is a beautiful affair relationship as Bob has his wife and kids at home, and Charlotte has her husband taking photos every day.  The sad thing is, is that they both know that the relationship which has become so close and real, will never last and that eventually Bob will have to leave...
Sofia Coppola's masterful direction and the beautiful atmosphere create an overall atmospheric and well-crafted tale of love and curiosity of the unknown. Coppola writes with such realistic tension and style that it was almost as if I saw these characters outside my bedroom window, or as if they were one of my own family members. The entire story is touching and heartwarming, filled with hilarious moments along the way. The connection between Murray and Johanssan is pure magical and the two of them seem meant to be. The difference between ages of the two makes it even more a touching film as Charlotte seeks out love, kindness and attention from Bob and he seeks out the same thing from her. The music is another excellent thing about this film, as it adds the modern touch to the images captured from this modern city of Tokyo, Japan. Some of the music is rock and roll which we are all familiar with which adds a sense of familiarity to the characters in the story.
I can sum up all of my review with one word. There is only one word that could ever pay the best compliment to a film or a book: great.",1077062400,4,2880,4.464895635673624
1507723,1,B00005JMJ4,"My dad and I just caught this thing in the theatre. Yawn. I'm sick and tired of these atmospheric, episodic, pointless ""art"" movies. Endless scenes of Tokyo, endless scenes of the characters staring into space, endless ""funny"" scenes of Murray and Johannson sitting there while someone speaks Japanese at them, endless scenes where they sample Tokyo's nightlife, endless scenes that seemed to have nothing to do with anything (e.g., the flower-arranging, the karaoke singing, the hospital visit) and NO PLOT WHATSOEVER. No tension, no character-building, no genuine bittersweetness. Why the heck was Johansson's character so attracted to Murray's? He looked like a walking corpse. And why was Murray praised so highly for this role? He was just playing the same character that he's always played, only more tired and worn down. I kept thinking he was a retired, burned out Peter Venkman from Ghostbusters. And if Johansson's character is so smart (recent Yale graduate), why didn't she bring some books and music along to kill time? Why isn't she at least surfing the net instead of sitting in her underwear staring out the window, feeling sorry for herself? Why doesn't she see if the hotel has some English-language guides to local museums or whatever? Did she make no plans at all when deciding to travel to another country? Geez.

1507724,3,B00005JMJ4,"Focus films may be known for distributing films that are outside the formulaic holiwood system, but they're not so great on packing the disc with extras that most people want from a movie that's on the academy awards top honor list (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay (original), and Film).
Since my fellow reviewer above has talked at great length about the beauty and grace (as well as plot) of this film, I'm going to focus on the DVD EXTRAS and the PURCHASE VALUE of this dvd.
The Movie:  The 1:85:1 Anamorphic widescreen looks just as it should. The audio is a little on the quiet side at times, but should be loud enough through the center channel.  Considering what 5.1 stands for in the film industry these days...you're not going to get much out of your surround sound speakers...so a 2.0 track would have been nice.  The performances by Mr. Murray and Ms. Johansson are particularly sublime, in both what is said and what isn't said, considering the lengthy visual montages that occur throughout the film.  What might end up throwing some people off is Ms. Coppola's use of the camera and where she decides to put the focus.  She will, from time to time, let images slide in and out of focus and/or have the center of the frame far off from the action, catching bits of each event but never really focusing the scene on any one character.  However, taught editing saves this piece from spiraling downward into the realm of the visually incoherent, and the minimalist script fills in the gaps of picture/music/ambient sound nicely.  Overall: a well done sophomore attempt.
The Extras:  NO COMMENTARY TRACK!  This movie is screaming for a commentary track.  And yet, we don't get the pleasure of one.  So a lot of things that might have been explained directly from the horses mouth get left to confusion or, to put it frankly, ""lost in translation"".  Sure, I think it's great to put commentary tracks on the big budget films and find out how difficult it was, exactly, to blow up that big thing with the other big thing.  But I'm equally as interested to hear how it went behind the scenes of these smaller, artier films...how the director had to get certain shots, if they improved a scene a certain way or not, was it difficult shooting the Megalopolis of Tokyo, Japan, etc.  In my opinion, that's equally as interesting.  Word to the wise, Ms. Coppola: please don't go the route of Mr. Spielberg, give us our commentary.
Then there is the ""Lost on Location"" documentary on the filming process.  It's about 30-40 minutes long and has some interesting scenes on how shooting went down, some funny outtakes and tidbits of information.  But once again, it doesn't really go into any details.  It doesn't explain where she got the idea, why Japan, what the studios thought of the idea, what her folks thought, what interested Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  But at least it's quaint.
Then there's the last worthwhile extra, the ""Interview Murray and Coppola"" - which is taken a year after the film and is about 10 minutes long.  It gives a small window into why the picture was made and some of the hard points of doing a picture like ""Translation"", but doesn't really dig deep.  It's just an interview with bits of film footage cut in between clips of the interview.
The Lowdown:  If you saw the movie and loved it or you heard the hype and wanted to see what everyone was talking about, then by all means you should totally get this DVD.  The movie, love it or hate it, is the kind of filmmaking that rarely sees the light of day in this ""popcorn thriller"" producer driven cinema world we see today.  However, if you're looking for a DVD that answers some of your burning questions or brings to light things you didn't notice when you saw it in the theaters, look somewhere else...because this DVD package doesn't even come close.  Maybe if it wins some awards we'll see a second release with a commentary track or two...but I'm not holding my breath.

Since young I always had relationships with guys and it was refreshing to see the poignant touch Bill M. put to the part. He showed the restraint of someone who respected youth too much to just bed down with it and the young actress Scarlett who played the young (and felt abandoned wife) took the role and played it as a girl who was actually more mature than her years. She felt Bill M's Character needed some emotional company and gave it to him, not lending physical love but emotional love instead.

""Lost in Translation,"" Sofia Coppola's follow-up to her remarkable debut, ""The Virgin Suicides,"" is a beautiful, subtle, funny and touching film. The uncomplicated plot revolves around two Americans staying in Tokyo; a middle-aged movie star (Bill Murray) and the young wife of a photographer (Scarlett Johansson). Both characters are lonely, isolated, and experiencing serious culture shock, so despite their age difference they come together to form a sincere and tender bond. The dazzling visuals of Tokyo and the droll humor of the supporting characters enhance the film, but never distract from the relationship between the leads that is the film's core. Bravo!

A young girl who does not get along well with people her own age, falls for an older more seasoned man. That man is Bill Murray's character, who is not interesting at all. He sits around staring out windows and drinking in a hotel bar. Except for the occasional monotone phone conversation with his wife, he hardly shows any character. Why this young girl is suppose to fall in love with this dreary older man is a complete mystery to me. I guess love is blind, in this case it is VERY blind. The worst part is when they decide to go out on the town. They encounter annoying and tacky people who like to sing karaoke.

The idea of a twenty-three or twenty-four year old beauty making overtures to an aging American (even with Murray's comedy and charm) made me scratch my head before the movie even really got started. For a movie to sweep the awards causes my expectations to go pretty high, which frequently proves somewhat a let-down when I actually experience the film.
I gradually warmed up to these interesting characters and their bizarre (and privileged) relationship but almost snoozed when Murray was filming the commercials and wandering around as if he didn't have a clue. The seemingly unsatisfying relationship between the young couple seemed forced and cliched, the young man appearing to be so remiss and so uncaring and such a parody of the young ""hip"" working artist. Again, in real life a joker like this would have been thanking his lucky stars for being with such a hottie and doing what he could to make sure she was enjoying herself and cared for in Tokyo.
The film is really carried by the depth of the two main characters and the gradually appealing and whimsical nature of their pseudo-relationship.
I cannot help but think that Coppola has taken the ""nepotism pays"" motif to such an all-time high that it's truly impossible to objectively review this work. The hype is way too high for what we actually get.
I obviously enjoyed getting to know these characters but found the film ultimately lacking in substance. I just don't think that everything which is atmospheric and melancholic justifies the description of genius.
Geeez, I hate to be such a naysayer on this one, I just found the boredom level to be a tad high relative to the expectations. Would have been nice to discover this one (and all its charm) separate from the hype.",1076976000,,1880,4.841614906832298

There was the amusing mis-communication between English and Japanese languages. There was the amusing ""westernization"" of the Japanese - the clothing, hairstyles and personna adapted from too much American TV and movies, the advanced video games, the glitter of high tech, etc.
There was the connection between Murray and his female co star. But it seemed shallow and left me disappointed with the movie in general.
Again, Murray is a likeable guy. But, I'm afraid the movie's translation was really lost - on me.

Yeah,shes not to smart. She was needing for something to happen that she could clearly understand,yet it didnt,so she didn't like it.
  This is one of the best movies I have seen. Its the kind of picture that will probably stay with you forever,like a part of you're own life. It is so good  because it captures some of the most honest moments that are only caught once,just this one time,and you can see that,and miss it the minute its over.

But with closer observation, strange and bizarre things come to light.  From crazy TV talk shows, to Buddhist temples, to inexplicable politeness and reserve, the viewer is shown tidbits of Japanese society without either negative or positive commentary.  Coppola allows the viewer to process the information just as the protagonists do.  And these ""alien"" observations only add to the feeling of being lost in a foreign land.
Scarlett Johansson was wonderful.  She displayed such an enchanting ""naturalness"" thoughout the film.  Her performance, in my opinion, was more impressive than Murray's.",1076889600,,768,5.684210526315789

1507941,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation was a breath of fresh air from the usual prefab Hollywood Glitz.  It was great to see such a mainstream actor like Bill Murray in this type of role.  This movie focused on what many frequent business travelers feel when they are always on the road from their wife and kids.  They are ""lost"" in the figurative sense and in the literal sense.  In this movie, Murray meets the lovely Johansson along the way who is also lost.  Together the two have great dialogue and do a little bit in the way of ""finding"" themselves.
What was so great about this movie was how true it is to real life.  Strangers don't typically hop into bed together with reckless abandon, and when people are making choices there concsience always plays a part in the decision.  In this movie, you can really see the battling of Murray and Johasson with their innerselves.  They want to take a particular course of action, but yet they know in their heart that it isn't the proper course.
Sofia Coppola showed a very strong effort in her sophomore film.  With this promising film, hopefully many more great things are on the way from her.",1076889600,2,1126,4.534653465346534

1507943,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation's title is perfectly just that-lost.  In Sofia Coppola's movie about two strangers in a foreign land, the entire plot feels like a small part cut out of something larger; the storyline seems at some points directionless and by the end, the character's problems ultimately unresolved.  But that's what makes this movie so good.
The film starts off with Bob Harris (Bill Murray), whose shining days as an American actor are now behind him, traveling to Japan to film commercials for whiskey.  Hating himself for being reduced to a beverage spokesman, the job eats away at Bob as he wishes he were still making movies.  Spending most of the time at the bar, in the hotel he's staying at, Bob tries to scrounge up any relief he can find through drinking.  During a regular visit, Bob stumbles upon another seemingly lost soul like him, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson).  Charlotte, accompanying her photographer husband John, feels also out of place as John works through the week, leaving her to wander Japan alone.  After the two meet, they quickly find solace in each other when they both realize just how commonly aimless they feel.
What makes this movie work is mainly because of how these two actors pull off such remarkable performances.  Murray slips on the role of this aged character to the point where it blurs the lines of whether he's acting or just displaying himself.  Murray acts out quick witted comments with his character, giving brief hints that there is so much more to Bob but that the middle-aged whiskey endorsing actor is just tired of it all and is barely balancing himself from falling into a mental breakdown.
Johansson does the same by adding such a normal, human quality to Charlotte.  Some of the best moments in the film come from Johansson simply when she doesn't speak, as if her character were briefly pausing to try and prevent a stream of emotions and speculations from overwhelming her.
And that's how the comedic aspect of this movie works effectively.  Coppola relies heavily on the notion of culture clash to get across most of the jokes, with abundant situations of misunderstandings between the two characters versus the rest of Japan.  But it's the sense of weight that Bob and Charlotte carry on their shoulders that translates into the more humorous scenes of their adventuring in Tokyo.  And that comedy sticks with the audience with deep tone of sadness clinging onto each joke, as both characters make it clear that after whatever fun they've experienced, it ultimately doesn't fill that hole in their lives.
It's this sense of human fragility that Coppola shows in the movie that makes it a hauntingly memorable piece.  Even though she recently graduated from Yale, Charlotte feels even more directionless then ever before, resorting to cheap tapes about soul searching in trying to make sense of her life.  In a critical moment, she finally starts to realize certain aspects of her life, as she admits over the phone and to herself, ""I don't know who I married.""  In a similar scene, Bob catches a glimpse of his previous career on the television in his hotel room, revealing all the raw feelings and missed hopes solely in his eyes as he silently stares at the screen.
Some might argue about a weak ending because the character's problems aren't resolved at all and they're stuck in the same situation as before. Yet this is what strengthens the film.  Because the characters don't solve all their problems no matter how much they want to, that just makes the film more of what it sets out to be.  Even if we find brief peace in other people, like Bob and Charlotte do in one another, sometimes it's not enough.
As the title suggests, the film is about the process of people trying to translate to themselves what they want out of life: only to lose words and meanings here and there in their scattered interpretation.  By connecting with each other, Bob and Charlotte start to scratch off the layers and get a grasp of what they truly want.  And the age difference between the characters only makes it more poignant in showing that sometimes age and experiences can't solve all our troubles.
 All these bits and pieces, meanings and emotions, form a solid basis in which Coppola revolves her film around.  With a simple setting in a foreign country, Coppola doesn't make her characters sound like insensitive tourists but rather further brings out what Charlotte and Bob are going through.
There's so much of this deeply filled movie waiting to be defined by its superficially simplistic, but ultimately resonating scenes that it makes Lost in Translation one of the most subtly powerful movies to come along in a while and something certainly not to be missed.",1076889600,7,4728,4.8399503722084365
1507944,4,B00005JMJ4,"This is a movie about how hard it is to ever really connect with people, beause communication is difficult if not impossible.  Words are too unstable and there are too many other things going on.  Both of the main characters feel lost; they try to communicate this to loved ones, but can't get through.  Everyone is too busy and there's nothing really wrong, nothing one can talk about.  They feel they have lost touch not only with their loved ones, but also with the world in general.  Ms. Coppola knows what she is doing and executes her theme well.  Tokyo, because it is such a fast-paced, confusing, foreign place, is the perfect spiritual location for these two lost people who somehow manage to connect.  It is not through action or words; they never do anything momentous and only occasionally say anything out of the ordinary.  Connection is a miracle; trying to analyze or explain it would ruin it.  The final moment of the movie is one character whispering something to the other; even the audience is left out of their communication, their connection, and it is appropriate, even poignant. It's pretty impressive that someone can even make a movie about such a thing without ruining it.",1076889600,4,1198,4.776699029126213

They've disabled it in this portion of the DVD!  All you can do is do a forward scan... it still takes close to 10 minutes to get to the movie!!! Each time you play it!

1507947,5,B00005JMJ4,"The film is a terrific and beautiful one and I can only agree with the more profound thinkers and eloquent writers here in expressing my admiration for Sofia Coppola, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johanssen.  The cinematography is captivating and the dialogue (at only 41 minutes of a two hour film) makes you listen because of its brevity and profundity.  This film also has what I consider, truly, one of the most touching and sincere endings I can ever imagine in a film.  It will make you smile in appreciation of the gift you have received in watching this movie.
My ONLY complaint, though, is the DVD itself.  I have seen this echoed elsewhere, but it is worth repeating.
Firstly, the cover.  One does not expect very large review captions on the cover of what this hunble reviewer would consider a work of art.  Scroll to the top of page and observe the large white block running horizontally across the cover.  By my estimation, nearly a quarter of the image is review block.
Secondly, the cover photo has been, I think, altered.  The same photo is on the cover of the movie's soundtrack, and it shows much darker and muted tones, more in line, I believe, with the color scheme found in the film.
Thirdly, I was incredibly disappointed in the commercials at the beginning of the disk that cannot be skipped.  You must fast forward through them.
My only hope is that the DVD was created so poorly only so the Criterion Collection can release a definitive masterwork at a later date (think Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums when thinking how high the art of the DVD can go).
All said, I bought the DVD its first day of release and would do so again, knowing the quality of the DVD (only its packaging, not sound or video quality).
A tremendous film in a lousy package.  Criterion....I wait for you.",1076889600,3,1796,4.601880877742946
1508038,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is director Sofia Coppola's remarkable study of the isolation and intimacy that people experience in both emotional and geographical environments. The film takes place in contemporary Tokyo where retired B-Movie actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray) has come to film a commercial for a Japanese whiskey company. Harris spends his days enduring the bizarre yet entirely believable process of shooting a commercial in a country whose language and culture are completely beyond his understanding. He spends his evenings alone in the bedroom, the gym, or the bar of his lavish hotel where practically every moment seems surreal for one reason or another. In the bar, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who has followed her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi) to Tokyo where he is working on an extended project.
At first, Bob and Charlotte develop a casual friendship based on their mutual sense of loneliness, lack of fulfillment, and their response to the sheer oddity of their surroundings. But soon their friendship develops into a deeper sense of understanding and intimacy, and with this come new complications. Both of them are married to spouses who for one reason or another are inaccessible, Bob is much older than Charlotte, and while he has experienced financial success and built a family, she is still at a point in her life where she is young and unsure of where she is headed. Charlotte almost never sees her husband, and the few times that she does he is busy cavorting with his colleagues and clients. Bob receives regular phone calls from his wife, but they only discuss her remodeling plans for their home.
In the hands of an unskilled filmmaker, this situation would be ripe for all kinds of clichd and predictable behavior. Instead, Coppola shapes their story with impressive ease and with an extraordinary understanding of the human soul. There is a lot of subtle stuff going on between Charlotte and Bob, but we never get bored or confused as their relationship develops and then conflicts arise. Similarly, despite the fact both characters are lost in Tokyo with its intense, pop-culture energy, the film never condemns or makes fun of that place. Like their personal lives, Tokyo for Bob and Charlotte is simply a space that they inhabit but in which they also feel utterly lost.
While ""Lost in Translation"" explores some very serious themes it remains a hilarious and low-key film from start to finish. I have to agree with critics or reviewers who state that this is the best role of Bill Murray's career. Johansson also delivers an extremely skilled and subtle performance. There are also many extraordinarily funny scenes in which Bob and Charlotte find themselves interacting with people or in situations that they don't understand. During many of these scenes the film pulls no punches when it comes to fully exposing some of the more bizarre and eccentric qualities of contemporary Japanese culture.  Much to its credit, however the film does this in an upfront fashion without stooping to insults or stereotypes-it's simply too honest to do that.
I highly recommend this film for its humor, its insight, and for the remarkable performances from Bill Murray, Scarlet Johansson, and the city of Tokyo. Coppola should be highly commended for her creative genius as a director and as a screenwriter.",1076889600,3,3355,5.077898550724638

The ending scene was heartbreaking and beautiful, and the fact that Coppola did not let the audience hear what Bill Murray whispers into her ear made it even more alluring to me. It leaves you to imagine what may have been said, and what could happen to these two lost souls AFTER the movie is over and in their future lives.

Lost in Translation is a haunting drama displaying the emptiness and rootlessness of western culture; especially westernized Japanese culture.

I do not usually  ""relate"" to films but I will admit this movie had me from scene one.  Bill Murray astounded me and he very much deserves the Oscar for this role. (making up for the supporting actor snub from the Royal Tenenbaums)  I am a little perplexed by the lack of recognition for Scarlett Johansson however.
  I love the fact that this movie is about the real, gritty and a lot of the times banal moments of people's lives.  If you watch this film with an open mind and dare I say heart it will leave you stinging. Not to worry the ending will kick you in the gut but in way that is reminiscent of Casablanca. Not a happy ending but in no way a sad ending. Do not misunderstand me however this movie is funny. Not always in a huge guffaw manor but will make you crack a quite a few smiles.  Just seeing Bill Murray sing ""More Than This"" by Roxy Music on karaoke is priceless.
  Oh... and the soundtrack... FABULOUS.
So if you didn't like this movie on the first viewing may I ask you rewatch it without the expectations you placed upon it. Its not an all out comedy nor is it an all out drama.  Everybody has that one story they never tell.  That one person you met somewhere, maybe at a bar, on the bus, in a different city or perhaps another country.

Who might it be for?  For one, someone who is more into character close-ups than plot twists.  The whole movie is about getting under the surface of Bob and Charlotte (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) at a brief, intersecting point in their lives, two Americans half a world away in Tokyo.  Timewise, the movie covers roughly 3-4 days ... which doesn't allow for much in the way of plot surprises.  The movie is effective in stepping the viewer into their shoes: it INTENDS to reflect a sense of intermittent boredom.  In my opinion without actually being a boring movie, but that I would say is where reviewers take sides.  Frankly, I can see why some think this movie is a chore to sit through.  On the other hand, I can hardly wait to see it again.
Also, what does one expect from a Bill Murray movie?  Here the spry wit that has saved many otherwise forgettable movies is mostly subdued, as befits a middle-aged has-been actor (not Murray himself, of course I mean the role he's playing here).  If you can block out memories of the often-hilarious energy Murray brought to previous roles, then I believe his efforts in L.I.T. can be better appreciated by those who don't already see ""best actor award"" in his performance.  L.I.T. seems more a ""dramedy,"" and I think some of the movie trailers create expectations more in line with Murray's past films than the one it is attempting to sell.  This movie is imo on the ""other side"" of GROUNDHOG DAY from the starting point of such B.M. feel-good vehicles as STRIPES or GHOSTBUSTERS.
As far as how Japan is portrayed, I'd say L.I.T. does present a wide cross-section of Japanese people, from business professionals to bizarre television hosts.  To the extent that particular scenes do focus on some of the wackier aspects of Japanese pop culture, I'd say that this is another example of director Coppola attempting to look at Tokyo through the eyes of the lead characters, both of whom are experiencing culture shock (not to mention jet-lag) and thus more likely to see their surroundings in a skewed manner (and being that this is a movie, if the director opts to represent that bias he/she has to visualize it, which is likely to involve a bit of stereotyping).  Overall, L.I.T. gets my two thumbs up, but I would say to any potential buyers who aren't familiar with the film to check out other reviews -- those who love it AND those who pan it.  Because TRANSLATION is the type of off-center movie that will polarize audiences.  As such I rated it four stars, although for me it's a five star film.",1076803200,3,2674,4.6716417910447765

Both are lonely, tired, and out-of-place, but when they find each other, a deep bond forms, and the two actors had a nice chemistry on screen.

Murray as an ex-action hero is also problematic. Bruce Willis would have been perfect: there's even a guest shot on Japanese TV that matches his scene on the cruise liner with Chris Tucker.  In the making-of documentary Sofia says she only considered Murray, so draw your own conclusions.
The film's sight and sound suggest sinus-related hearing loss as much as the jet lag and insomnia oft-mentioned.  But the filmmakers say they suffered this symptoms as well, so one must yield to cinema verite.
Although Murray's bed scene describing his life and family is a stunner, follow his character's lead by watching ""La Dolce Vita."" Marcello is matchless, and the interview with Sofia Coppola and Murray was filmed in Rome, but what is Coppola's point?",1076803200,,910,5.093959731543624

Next, I am not a film fascist, nor do I have a PhD. If I did, it would not be in Film. I don't even really care for film that much. You ""respond"" to allegations I never make--what we refer to as the ""strawman"" here in the academic community.
1. Of course non-PhD's can understand art and have reactions to it. I have never said you had to have a PhD, or in your case, an MA from UC-Irvine, a fine school for literary theory, to understand art. I said you had to understand a particular concept, one in which few people are educated either formally or informally, in order FULLY to GET the film.
2. I did not say that ""the only reason"" to dislike the movie would be failure to understand it. One may dislike the movie without failing to understand it, as I specifically pointed out in my review, in the part where I was wishing more such reviewers would offer what I consider helpful criticism of the film. None of this means that it is impossible to dislike something *because* you don't understand it. Lack of understanding, then, may be a sufficient condition without being a necessary one, to butcher the art of logic a bit.
2. Nor am I pompous. There is nothing wrong with not understanding postmodernism, not understanding academic concepts, or not understanding literature at all. However, if you don't, AND you hated this film with a flaming, one-star passion, there may be a connection.
3. People who do not understand postmodernism, which is indeed an academic concept and NOT something you understand intuitively, contrary to your assertion, are not going to understand why the characters are flat. Some people may intuitively enjoy the film anyway, as I think I would have before learning these things, as I enjoyed the Virgin Suicides when that film came out (although I admit freely that I didn't really, fully ""get"" it until years later). Some people may see the supposed requirement of fast-moving action and three-dimensional characters as shallow, based on intuition. Those who don't may simply believe that they are applying a calculus that is relevant to all movies (e.g., characters should not be flat or generic or whatever) without realizing the authorial/directorial intent behind it.
4. Comparing flat characters with ""bad"" special effects is silly and misleading, as the term ""bad"" makes evident. ""Flat"" characters are not, in this case, ""bad."" They may not be to an individual's taste, which is fine, but they don't constitute an actor's or director's failure in all cases. People who say ""the characters were flat"" act as though they are pointing out a flaw, not something intentional. Some movies are not meant to be effects-driven or are meant to have stylized scene-design or effects rather than realistic ones, but ""bad"" special effects usually refers to those of low-budget films that are trying but can't do any better. Again with the strawman.
5. The film is extremely postmodern in certain key regards. What are you talking about?! It is less postmodern than Coppola's earlier film, The Virgin Suicides, and doesn't deal with every important postmodern theme, but the centrality of communication problems (see also: the title) and of characters seeking to construct their identities around others and others' reflections of them should suffice.
Since you teach writing, as I have, I'm sure it is frustrating for you when students reject concepts or rules because they don't understand them, or at least without regard to understanding them--from paragraph structure to split infinitives to postmodernism or whatever else.
Many, many people, at least judging by Amazon reviewers, simply don't seem to get that not everything is supposed to fit into what we academics (nudge, nudge) term ""realism."" Realism is something that anyone can ""get"" as well as enjoy and something that non-academic types seem to prefer. People often say, ""Such and such film wasn't realistic,"" regardless of whether it aimed for realism or not. This bothers me. That's all I was saying, neighbor.",1076716800,,4097,4.965065502183406

1508248,1,B00005JMJ4,"I am in complete agreement with Jennifer Kokoski!!
This was ridiculously slow and boring.  I felt the piety of the characters to be interesting, but their attempt at redemption cheap.  They are sad and lonely because they think too much of themselves; and though Charlotte tries to make an attempt at being moved by the ""non-complex"" - it's still a cheap shot.  Her facial expressions of ""revelation"" made the character seem all the more pious.
The only ""good"" part of the flick is the intellectual connection between Bob and Charlotte. However, it just seemed like they were too busy feeling sorry for themselves.  ""Oh poor pitiful me....in a world surrounded by stupid people....and things I don't understand.....wah"".  Puhleeez.
Sorry folks - this flick is a dud.  Don't waste your money buying it.  Rent it first.  I'd say it's probably a ""cult"" like flick - and either you get it, or you don't.  I think I ""got it"" - and I still didn't like it.

1508249,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is a moving film filled with light humor and heart.  It has comedic and dramatic elements to it, and the two play together beautifully.  The film is definitely one of those that people will either love it or hate it; take it or leave it, etc.  Either way, it is a film that easily stays in your head after it is long over.
Bob Harris is currently in Tokyo to shoot a whisky commercial.  He was once a movie star but is now reduced to doing product endorsements.  It's easy to see that he isn't the most pleased with how things have gone in his life--but at the same time, he doesn't seem very regretful or overly depressed.  One night in a bar, he meets a young lady by the name of  Charlotte, who's also visiting in Tokyo due to her workaholic husband who's doing some photo shoots there.  Bob and Charlotte connect with one another in very little time and a unique bond of friendship is formed.
Whether the connection will be a short-lived or a long-term relationship is besides the point, but what is the point is those little connections we make on a daily basis and how much of a profound effect they can have on us.  Like the characters and the story, the film is superbly subtle and low-keyed.  The end result is a very entertaining and well-made film.  Bill Murray is outstanding as Bob Harris; knowing how to be comedic without ever breaking character.  I can now see why he won a Golden Globe for his performance and am happy that he has also received an Academy Award nomination (which he really deserves, I think).  Scarlett Johansson is an absolute joy to watch in her portrayal of the sweet and confused ""Charlotte.""  And even though we may not see much of him in the film, I must say that Giovanni Ribisi does a great job as being Charlotte's husband who appears to be more in love with his work than her.
The movie is extremely well-directed and well-written by Sofia Coppola.  What stands out especially the writing, as the conversations flow and sound real, and do not appear artificial to our ears.  Coppola is great at making us see these characters as real human beings rather than fictional film characters.  She really establishes what she wants in her film and how she plans to achieve it.  I also love how she chose Japan as the setting for this movie, as it is very easy for one to feel ""lost"" as the characters do.
Not only is the film a great viewing, but the DVD package is quite impressive as well.  It may not have as many ""bells and whistles"" as most DVDs do, but it really doesn't need all of that (however, I would've liked a commentary track with Coppola and Murray).  Extras included are a Behind-the-Scenes documentary, extended and deleted scenes, a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola featurette, a music video and more.  The best feature is an extended scene of Bob's appearance on an over-the-top Japanese talk show.  It is outrageously hilarious, and I encourage everybody to check it out as soon as the movie is over.  A downfall of the DVD is the annoying commercials at the beginning that you cannot skip, but have to fast-forward the whole thing if you desire to go straight to the menu.  I thought we were beyond this once we went from VHS to DVDs.  Apparently, I was wrong.  Still, not a shady DVD package, if you want my honest opinion.
""Lost in Translation"" is a superbly done film filled with humor and a number of profound little moments.  The movie is well-directed, well-written, and well-acted.  There's always a chance of you not liking the movie, but that's not a dangerous chance to take.  If you let hype consume you, then you will most likely be disappointed.  If you're willing to be open-minded and not make any judgments until the end credits, then the chances of you enjoying the film increases greatly.  A very nice and subtle movie that has more to it than what the eye simply sees. -Michael Crane",1076716800,7,3897,4.524285714285714

This film has had a profound effect on me and maby that feeling is based on my life at the present . Maby those people that hated it haven't had ""a moment"" to relate to it. Doesn't matter.

1508251,1,B00005JMJ4,"At least I only rented this travesty. This is one of the most boring, contrived and pretentious movies I have ever seen. The first half hour consists of the lead roles living frustratingly dull lives in Tokyo. 5 minutes of their monotony would have conveyed the point, but no Coppola had to beat the horse to a bloody stump presumably because she was so dazzled with the lights of Tokyo.
But I suffered through those 30 minutes hoping eventually a movie would break out. When the two lead characters actually meet, it appears to brighten... for about 5 seconds. Then we encunter a strange journey of characters sharing their boredom and absolutely no substance. Imagine sitting in a plain white room, with no color, and a stranger sits beside you saying ""I'm bored, you?"" You get almost 2 hours of this.
If the lead characters had bothered to explore why they are so bored with their lives and thus grown from knowing and confiding in each other, this movie would have had a chance of meaningful existence. All we can guess (and guessing is all we can do) is that Bob (Murray) is estranged from his wife and kids (they don't even want to talk to him on the phone), reduced to pimping his acting talents in foreign tv commercials and not in charge of his life anymore. And Charlotte is neglected wife and privileged Philosophy grad who suddenly discovers Philosophy did not provide a path to a rewarding career (surprise surprise). But why has Bob lost touch with his family? What worth does Charlotte have besides being a trophy wife? What meaningful existence do these two individuals have?
The movie should have answered those questions. Instead it looks more like a beautiful travelogue dazzling us with the sparkling lights of Tokyo.
It's a poor attempt at Art House pretention, overrated by a Hollywood crowd that lost touch with average people decades ago.
If you want a truly good soul searching story see UNDER A TUSCAN SUN instead. Beautiful scenes, wonderful acting and the true growth of a human being at loose ends in her life.",1076630400,18,2039,4.730337078651686

This is great from top to bottom... from the nuanced moodiness of Tokoyo, to the understated performances, to the simple-yet-poignant dialogue.  The location is a great metaphor for the state of the two character's lives and that they intersect here and how much they need each other in this one moment in time is really beautiful.  There's more sensuality and passion in their brief, unconsumated relationship than the most fiery affairs and when he last sees her, the look on her face will be seared in my memory forever.  You come to care about these people so much because they speak with such simple purity of what's in all of us - wanting to feel connected to someone or something.",1076630400,4,795,4.823529411764706

That's about all you get here, though. Director Sophia Coppola has created a bourgeois tale about lonely superstars, millionaires and dilletantes in Japan that seethes with poor-pity-me melodrama and American xenophobia (witness the endless 'L' for 'R' gags, or the the gush of verbage quickly summarized by a translator at the photo shoots). 'Lost In Translation' had a remarkable opportunity to build bridges with modern day Japan and blew them to maintain this idiotic sensibility. Aside from cinematography, the film does two things right: the soundtrack is packed with great music selections, and Anna Farris' character Kelly virtually defines the modern young Hollywood actress, with inane banter about body cleansing and the low-carb Japanese diet.",1076630400,6,899,5.521739130434782

In response to ogreadmore's pompous tirade: it's terribly patronizing to say that the only reason a person may not like a film you like is that he/she doesn't get it, even much more so because he/she doesn't understand an academic construct such as postmodernism. A person is not going to watch a film with flat characters, read that, oh, it's SUPPOSED to have flat characters (this film is SUPPOSED to be unrealistic, it's SUPPOSED to have bad special effects) and say, ""oh, it's good now.""  People who have concern with the flatness of characters are essentially saying they don't like postmodernism (this film isn't that postmodern, btw) and this is something they can understand intuitively. People without PhD's have emotions and can understand art--they are allowed to their opinions and don't need permission from some film fascist to like something.",1076630400,3,1112,5.076502732240437

The characters are real, involving, and sympathetic.  The acting is subtle and sidesplitting.  The feeling of being temporarily displaced in an unfamiliar culture is spot on.  The humor is intelligently understated (and hilarious).  The soundtrack perfectly adds to the mood without distracting.  The cinematography is stunning, notwishstanding Sofia's transparent and charmingly self-effacing comment delivered by Scarlett Johansson: ""I tried taking pictures, but they were so mediocre. I guess every girl goes through a photography phase. You know, horses... taking pictures of your feet.""  The pacing is genius.  The love story is believable and ultimately (and surprisingly) satisfying.  There's even a car chase scene (after a fashion).
""Lost in Translation"" mirrors life in that it has a set-up and a setting, but it's not so easy to define exactly ""what it's about.""

The truth people, is that this type of film is the type that thinks it is really clever, and the people who made it are very very pleased with themselves.

1508350,2,B00005JMJ4,"This film has been widely-praised, but it didn't come off for me: the heavy atmosphere in the immense hotel was well caught, but the director didn't seem to know what she was going for as there were the two other disjoined elements: the dreamy travelogue bits with Scarlett Johansson wandering around Tokyo, and the predictable Bill-Murray-pratfall scenes on the exercise machine and with the chubby masseuse.
The relationship with the stooge husband (Giovanni Ribisi) was unexplored and simply not credible to me, while the very old gag of a foreigner speaking for several minutes and the translator deciphering it in one sentence should really have been left on the cutting-room floor.  In fact there were too many scenes of Japanese people speaking Japanese for comic purposes - which is unfunny and a tad racist at the end of the day.
The cheesy underbelly of Tokyo, with repellent arcades and interminable karaoke sessions were just boring - and no better (to me anyway) than the superficial gatherings in the hotel with the bimbo actress which they were presumably supposed to stand against in stark relief.  I can't undertand why the leads' performances have been praised (and nominated for Oscars, believe it or not), as Bill Murray in particular doesn't really do anything that he hasn't done in other films: the usual stony impassiveness, dry timing and carefully scripted asides were just the same as in Ghostbusters nearly 20 years ago.

Don't get me wrong, ""Caddyshack"" is a great film and Murray is fantastic in it, but ""Lost"" is a completely different film altogether.  Sofia Coppola avoids the sophomore slump by crafting a slow burn of a story that slowly draws the audience into the world of two characters who are simply aching for some sort of connection.  Murray's Bob Harris has come to endorse a whiskey for a tidy amount of yen, and Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte (in another brilliant performance from this promising young star) has come with her hipster photographer husband, hoping to spend some time with him.  But both characters find themselves totally alone in the vastly different world of Tokyo, and I don't mean simply the language barrier, I'm talking about the cultural walls that are in place.  Japan is not American-friendly, and though it may not be by choice, to be totally alone in a country so different from your own can cause feelings of intense isolation.  In ""Lost in Translation"" we see these feelings onscreen, and the path these characters take and how they change their lives with each other's help is astonishing.  Little moments shine, such as the patting of a foot, or an awkward moment during a fire drill, or the hilarious scenes that come out of some harmless jabbing at Japanese culture.  Come on kids, they do it to us all the time. I've been there, and it's fun to poke fun.  So lighten up everyone, go in expecting something different and let the movie take you.

1508352,4,B00005JMJ4,"Well, I'm not going to reiterate what this film is about. But I will defend this film to those who gave it VERY low ratings.
Miss Coppola made a film that serves as an homage to the high Neorealism films of Italy. ""Lost in Translation"" evokes emotions without forcing tears, anger, happiness, etc. Minimalist in nature, yet rich in content.
Modern audiences are too used to movies that tell us when to cry or when to be happy. Coppola trusts the audience. This film teaches audiences how to truly watch a film. In my opinion, I think it's cheap to zoom in on a tear to cue the audience to feel sad with the actor. It's more difficult for a director to let a camera sit and watch a character, examine them, and just by subtle gestures, we begin to realize the depth of that character.
Ever looked out the window on a bus stop? People sit and wait, and just by looking at them, we know exactly what they're feeling.
The only thing I had a problem with was the use of Anna Faris. Though humorous, I felt she could have played a character who really acted like a serious actress. I felt she knew she was playing a bimbo and made sure the camera captured it. I thought it would have been more effective had she believed she really was a real actress.
Nevertheless, this film will remain timeless. It's a proud film to follow Scarlett Johanssen for the rest of her career, a great performance that Bill Murray will be remembered for, and an extraordinary feat by Sofia Coppola.
This film could have been formulaic: young girl meets older gent. Fall into a mad affair, beautiful love scenes, and a dreamy goodbye. But no. Coppola doesn't want to cheat the audience. ""Lost in Translation"" is an experience. It's quiet sadness, quiet love, and quiet goodbyes; a demonstration of a real love story.",1076544000,57,1788,4.504615384615384

1508354,4,B00005JMJ4,"I saw this film in the theater with my wife and we both enjoyed it. Its one major flaw was a few long, dull scenes. Having lived in Japan for over a year I can say it's very accurate how you might experience the country for the first time, and I am very impressed that the director mirrored my experiences so well. My wife who hasn't been to Japan left with the impression of how foreign and unwelcoming it is, because the director really did a good job of creating the feeling she wanted. However, the characters in the movie are not tourists per se, and are not really exploring Japan, just dealing with their own personal crises. If you go as an eager traveler with open eyes, you will have a different attitude. As they say, ""Wherever you go, there you are.""
I am sure the movie won't resonate with everyone, because it doesn't explain the nuances of--for example--foreign travel. One angry reviewer wrote complained about the characters with ""insomnia""--obviously missing the basic fact that the characters in the movie had jet lag throughout the whole movie.
The story between the two main characters is not your conventional love story, but it does have a bit of comedy and a lot of loneliness. I thought it was more true and realistic than the typical Big Fat Greek Wedding, showing two people drawn to each other because of their own difficult situations, though they are obviously not ""soul mates"".

1508425,5,B00005JMJ4,"Now that I have seen it, the hoopla surrounding this movie is quite interesting.  This is not a mainstream movie by any stretch of the imagination.  Some people think that any movie with such a description is for film snobs only.  Whatever, but I don't think you have to be a film snob to be affected by ""Lost In Translation"".  You just need to appreciate the concept of a time, place, and a combination of people.  That is basically what the movie is.  There's no trajectory to the plot, really.  It just takes you through a few days and nights in modern Japan, with two different people from different generations yet with complementary mental states.  Either the viewer is with these people or s/he is not.  That's why I am surprised by its success, because I wouldn't think that many people would care.  I think they only really care about Bill Murray, and want to laugh.  Most of those people will be disappointed.  It doesn't mean they can't appreciate a good movie, it just means they aren't in it for the short ride.  I'm sure that if many of those people revisit the film in 10 or 20 years, they might think differently.  And that is always the true test of a great film.  I am looking forward to seeing if it holds up over time.
But not for nothing, at least try to enjoy two of the years best performances on film.  Young Scarlett deserves just as much attention as Bill does.  Her pitch was perfect all throughout, just the way I would have wanted it if I were the director.  And I for one thought the ending was just right.  I would have been tempted to go for a more sentimental conclusion, but this one is very moving nonetheless.
Another reason why I liked this movie so much is because it sort of reminds me of my favorite film, ""Midnight Cowboy"".  That hardly ever happens.  It's interesting to see it in a modern context with different dynamics, though the basic themes of loneliness and redemption through human contact are there.  To express those themes this eloquently does not happen often on film.  This is truly a work of art.",1076544000,,2052,4.471698113207547

1508427,4,B00005JMJ4,"I have never been a big Bill Murray fan.  I have seen most of his movies, but never really appreciated his comedy, or his style.  I was very pleased with his performance in this film, playing the washed up Harris with just the right amounts of star quality and despondent resolution to his fate as a man on the way out of fame.
For a movie that has a funny man in the leading role, I found that most of the movie just made me very sad, but I found myself laughing all the same.  The scenes in which Johanssen and Murray play together are filled with laughter and the happiness that one feels when surrounded by friends, and are starkly contrasted by the scenes in which they are apart, and we are reminded of the fact that the characters are away from home and loved ones.  As a frequent traveller, I know both of these feelings well, the laughter during the day that makes you forget that you are far from home, and how it often hits you like a ton of bricks when you are alone in your hotel room.
Admittedly, the mere emotion of travel does not a good movie make.  What made me enjoy the movie more was the fact that it took place in Japan.  Having spent some time there myself, I watched this film and often found myself remembering odd occurances and the eccentricities one finds while being an American in Japan (the scene in the private Karaoke suite is great).  To add to this, the literal issues of translation were staggeringly funny, but mostly because I have been faced with them before.  The concept of ""translating"" a culture is nowhere more evident than when comparing American and Japanese life, which share many similarities, but diverge at critical points to make the experience sometimes frustrating, but often humorous in retrospect.  I think that this movie captures this feeling in such a marvelous manner.
My final recommendation would be as follows:
If you deal with Japanese culture or have visited Japan, see this movie.
If you have never been to Japan, don't let that discourage you, but keep in mind that you may have the urge to turn to your viewing partners all the time and say: ""what was that about?"".",1076544000,4,2132,4.5025906735751295

1508431,5,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray has been one of the most unappreciated actors in Hollywood.  Thought of for the goofball characters he created on Saturday Night Live and in such comedy classics as Caddyshack, Stripes & Ghostbusters, his acting ability is overlooked.  But as he proved in those films and equally great turns in Ed Wood, Groundhog Day, Rushmore, Hamlet, Wild Things and others, the man can act.  In Lost In Translation, he gives a performance for the ages.  Mr. Murray plays Bob Harris a movie star who travels to Japan to make two million dollars for a whiskey ad campaign.  He is jet-lagged, has to deal with a director who doesn't speak English and struggle with the banality of his life.  While winding down in the hotel bar, he meets young Charlotte who is in Japan with her photographer husband.  She too is trying to come to grips with her life, but unlike Bob who is trying to revitalize his life, she is trying to find her direction in life.  Both us each other to escape the confines of the hotel and escape for a few nights out on the town.  They meet up with some Charlotte's friends and end up in a bizarre club and then singing karaoke.  This produces one of the film's most poignant moments when Bob sings Roxy Music's ""More Than This"".  In the performance, you see Bob baring his soul to Charlotte.  The movie ends with Bob and Charlotte embracing on the streets of Tokyo and Bob getting back in his car driving to the airport.  Charlotte is played magnificently by Scarlett Johansson and she is almost the equal of Mr. Murray.  The brilliance of the film is in its quiet nature.  Sometimes the two companions don't speak but you know exactly what they are thinking through their expressions.  Mr. Murray conveys senses of fatigue, bemusement, wonderment, aggravation and exasperation all with out ever uttering a word.  It is these little nuances that turns his performance from simply great to a once in a lifetime achievement.  Director and writer Sofia Coppola has learned well from his famous father and she has crafted a subtle yet powerful and emotional film that is one of the best films of 2003.",1076544000,2,2115,4.654986522911051

One is a actor who is there doing wine commercials and the other is a lonely wife of a phographer who has no time for her. They meet one night at the bar in the motel they're staying at and after that start spending more time together. They get so close as friends that it's gonna be hard for both of them when it's time to say their good-byes.
  I guess you can say they fall in love but there's no sex, is basically romance without the romance. That's a nice change too and it just leaves the film to be sweet and innocent. It shows that 2 people can enjoy being with each other without sex as well which a lot of movies don't have. Mean in a lot movies, guy meets girl and they hit if off and have sex. Here guy meets girl, they hit it off but never have sex. Even if the movie isn't really meant to be romantic it still is. It sorta has a Casablanca feel to it where they love each other but can never be together. She's married and so is he. So they just enjoy each others company and make the best of their otherwise boring and lonely trip to Japan. It's a very mellow film but the fact that it can be slow and mellow makes it seem more realistic.

It's a simple story:  two discontented souls with massive jet-lag, and big relationship issues, meet by happenstance in Tokyo, and provide comfort to one-another.
Within the simplicity Ms. Coppola nails jet-lag, ennui, relationship discontent, and Americans abroad with a gentle, humorous, and deft touch.  She also gets the attraction of age for youth, and vice versa, but keeps it grounded in how things could really happen, rather than slipping into middle-age fantasy.
All the performances work.  Bill Murray shows something near genius, and Scarlett Johannson is lovely and effective, though she has less to do.  The supporting characters are also well drawn, and the players inhabit their roles.

As the movie progresses you learn that Bill's marriage isn't even a happy one. Overall, I thought Bill Murray gave a great performance in this film, and in terms of visual aspects I really liked the cinematography. The best scene in this film is when Bill Murray is at his Whiskey ad shoot. As for the story line, it sort of meanders all over the place and ended up with no real resolution other than leaving you with the idea that through all the isolation and boredom it brought two people together and gave them both an experience that was memorable.

While there is some light comedy in the movie, those that expect to see a laugh out loud material will be sorely disappointed.  This is a subtle movie about two lonely people in a foreign land trying to figure out what to do next in life.  The contrast between the two characters, played by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, provides an interesting story.  Scarlett is a young woman, newly married and graduated from college while Bill is a famous actor whose prime days have passed and yet both are struggling with finding direction in their lives.  Their struggle is compounded by the fact that they are in a strange country with stark cultural differences and have indifferent spouses.  This is a movie about friendship and making the most out of a tough situation.  It reminds me a bit of ""The Big Chill"" but without the ensemble cast. If you don't expect a roaring comedy, or to be blown away because of its Oscar nominations, then I think you will enjoy this movie.

As these three movies have progressed in sophistication, the leading young ladies have also progressed.

This movie is about two people who just can't connect with their own lives, but who come to find one another through sheer chance, or fate or whatever. They temporatily shelve their ennui, and learn to live a little. Nothing shocking takes place, this is no Last Tango in Paris, which is part of what's so good. It's sort of saying that the biggest crises are in life's quiet desperations, not big obvious life defining moments. I like that message.

How else would you show that? Exactly the way Sophia Coppola does, with close-ups and self-depricating dialogue. This movie captured the ""otherness and familarity"" of many Asian cities. Tokyo is the other star of the film and the warmth of the Japanese people. I didn't feel that this movie denigrated the Japanese at all. You have to pay attention to the naunces in the movie.

1508512,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola follows up her lovely film The Virgin Suicides with this gem of a film, Lost In Translation. For someone such as myself who passionately loathes the tedium and banality of mainstream Hollywood romantic comedies, Lost In Translation is a godsend. It doesn't waste time on a useless, predictable plot like so many romantic movies; this film is out to give the viewer an emotional experience. One thing I love is the way it's shot in a very realistic, almost documentary-like style. The characters feel like real people, not merely big stars who are just collecting a paycheck. The dialog feels truly genuine. That's what impressed me the most the first time I saw it. The dialog is real. It doesn't feel forced or phony and neither do the excellent performances. Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are truly perfect in their roles as two lonely souls who find each other amid the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The film tells us much about the characters using visuals. We see Bob and Charlotte spending time by themselves, searching for something or someone, perhaps. They meet and soon become friends, finding that they are in similar situations. In a place that is foreign to both of them, all they have is each other.
In a typical Hollywood movie, things would be familiar and typical. There would be cheap jokes, predictable situations and obvious dialouge. Lost In Translation, however, always keeps things fresh. Bill Murray gives a splendid performance as the weary Bob Harris, who finds a real friend in Scarlett Johansson's lonely Charlotte. Sofia Coppola's direction is perfect. The film feels real. It never feels like a production. The characters feel just like real people. The backdrop of Tokyo forms a wonderful canvas for this story, and it is beautifully photographed.
Lost In Translation is a wonderful film that is sure to delight viewers who are tired of phony Hollywood romance. The film never panders to audience expectations. It keeps things fresh, original, honest and genuine. It is truly one of the best films of 2003.",1076371200,5,2054,4.956521739130435

I've been hearing about this movie for months and I finally watched it with enthusiasm. I decided to give this movie two stars, one for the good cinematography and the other for trying to be different.

This movie had a lot of potential, it's about an older man who is having a mid-life crisis and a young woman who is trying to find herself but is feeling lost (both are from America). A plot that speaks to a lot of people I'm sure. The way this story is told is where it goes wrong. It felt like the director wanted to skimp on characterization so she took the easy way out and used a foreign country to showcase these two characters' feelings of loneliness and alienation instead of exploring why and how they became like this in America. The reason why I think this is because setting the movie in Japan does nothing to furthur explore these characters especially since they were already alone and lost BEFORE coming to Japan. I was disappointed to see the way the director portrayed Japanese people as weird and speaks bad English. I thought the way she highlighted these things were untrue, shallow, and unneccessary. She could have achieved the same effect (them being ""lost"") simply by focusing on the fact that they didn't know the area or any of the people there.
These two characters were also two very weak and boring people. Here they are disillusioned with thier lives, they have a perfect chance to find themselves again because they are in a beautiful, exciting, innovative country. All they have to do is walk outside and yet they sit around their hotel waiting for something to happen to them. How illogical is that?! Instead of being two mature people who can experience and enjoy thier great oppurtunities, they act like two immature, shallow kids.

I absolutely respect endings that are meaningful. I certainly don't expect to have things spelled out for me but I also don't want a pretentious ending.
If you are looking for a movie in this genre then try ""American Beauty"". ""Chungking express"" and ""Fallen angels"" are two amazing movies that have a similar theme but is MUCH more enjoyable to watch.",1076371200,3,2174,4.792
1508603,3,B00005JMJ4,"After watching Lost In Translation, I wanted to do two things: crawl into bed or go clubbing. I decided to hit the town. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have the same choices: resign yourself to the negatives in your life or grab the bull by the horns. Contrasting dilemmas: Moving toward the end - midlife crisis vs. starting off on the bad foot - bad marriage. However, the strength of Lost in Translation (LIT) is that it works in stripping away their respective problems' details, runs them through a blender, and voila: you have two people who realize that their problems are quite similar. The only major difference being one of timing: one hasn't made the changes yet and procrastinates while the other still has the potential to change yet fears the outcome. The backdrop of Tokyo serves as the negativity amplifier in that it forces their dilemmas to surface faster than normal and with intensity.

Most already know the story where a has-been actor is sent to Tokyo alone to film some TV ads (real actors who have done so: Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, Bruce Willis, Penelope Cruz, etc) while the other is accompanying her husband on a business trip. They meet up and being the lost souls that they are, make a connection. Both Murray and Johansson play their respective character with aplomb, especially Murray who while stoic at times, relies on subtle gestures to give life to his character. For one who is used to seeing him only in comedies, it was refreshing and perhaps indicates that he has more potential than we ever thought. Johansson on the other hand, seems to be on valium and though she still displays oodles of potential, her role in Ghost World to me was her breakout film. Then again, her character does spend most of her time in bed.

Lot's have been said about how LIT portrays Japan in a less than favorable light. Coming from a foreigner who has been living in Japan for close to a decade, I have to straddle the fence and say yes and no. It does provide every stereotype of the Japanese and some are true while others are grossly exaggerated. The difficult part is trying to understand director Coppola's intent. I'm left feeling that since the two main characters are new to Japan and are in transition, the corresponding views/images on Japan in the movie should reflect the typical foreign misconceptions and stereotypes (Japanese are not good at English, Japanese women are airy and immature, Japanese men are a masculine joke, etc.) We are seeing Japan through their eyes not through ones of a Japanophile who is planning to live and work there. If that were the case, I think you would have seen a very different Japan. In that sense, the images of Japan and the Japanese are appropriate. They are for the most part, wrong, very wrong but appropriate. Just remind yourself of that when watching LIT. You're seeing Japan through the eyes of two lost people, Westerners who have very little interest in being there.

It was bit too slow for more liking and I was expecting a very different film image-wise from Coppola who so effectively used tones and colors in the Virgin Suicides. Though entertaining, I do question what the hype is all about. Truth is the setting could have been any foreign country (Japan being chosen because of the contrasts) and the result probably would have been the same because it's not the location as much as it the characters' fragile frames of minds that is the meat of the story.",1076371200,6,3457,4.710743801652892
1508604,1,B00005JMJ4,"I was really, really looking forward to this movie.  I like Bill Murray.  I like films set in Asia in general, and Japan in particular.  I'm a fan of directors such as Akira Kurosawa and Zhang Yimou.  I thought this movie would somehow be in the same vein or in the same spirit as the films from those two directors.  Boy was I wrong.  Instead we get a movie about absolutely nothing...and that's no exageration nor is it an understatement.  The film literally goes nowhere.
Plot?  Don't look for it here.  Characterization?  Sorry.  Wasted potential?  You bet.
With a setting, in what is to most Americans, an exotic locale (Tokyo) you would think there would at least be some beautiful scenery.  Instead we get all these shots of the characters in their hotel room or in the hotel bar.  What a waste.  The few scenes we do get of beautiful Japan such as Mt. Fuji and Kyoto are short-lived, disjointed and do nothing to move the plot forward--but then we must remember there is no plot.
The character played by Scarlett Johannsen (Charlotte) is supposed to be this young, highly educated, and seemingly precocious wife trying to ""find her place in the world.""  She's in Japan accompanying her photographer husband played by Giovanni Ribisi.  Bill Murray's character (Bob Harris) is a middle-aged American film star who is bored with his wife and his life; he's in Japan to plug Suntory whisky and collect a nice paycheck of $2 million for his trouble.  Both of the main characters don't want to be in Japan and their vacant stares and apathetic countenaces in the face of all the neon blitz of Tokyo are meant to convey that.
The problem is that they both keep those vacant stares throughout the entire movie.  Literally nothing happens even after they meet each other and hang out together.
The film feels like Sophia Coppola told the actors to just do whatever they wanted (which is mostly just sitting and looking bored--how can you be bored in Tokyo???) and then she would edit the footage and try to make a film out of it.  We see Charlotte in her panties staring outside her hotel window.  We see Bob shaving.  We see Charlotte hanging fake cherry blossom ornaments in her hotel room in her underwear.  We see Bob at the hotel bar drinking Suntory whisky.  We see Charlotte in her panties staring outside her hotel window again.  We see Bob talking to his wife on the phone.  We see Bob at the hotel bar drinking Suntory whisky.  Ad nauseum.
Those critics who are raving about this film call this Bill Murray's break out role.  Um...excuse me, but this is the same character Bill Murray has been playing in all of his movies.  The funny straight-man type.  Transplant his character from Ghostbusters or Stripes and the movie would be no different.
And as for Scarlett Johannsen, if staring at everything with a blank look in your eyes is acting...sign me up.  I can do that and get paid for it, too.
I don't understand where all the accolades and the hype are coming from.  I could have made a better movie if I filmed my trip to Asia last year.  I met more interesting people and I saw more awesome sights than you'll see in this travesty on celluloid.  Please do not let this film put you off on visiting Japan.  The real thing could never be this boring!  Coppola just doesn't have the vision, skill, or maybe even the talent to make an interesting film.
She has much more studying and much more work to do before she can even be called a competent film-maker, much less a great one.  ""Lost in Translation"" does not deserve to win any awards, unless it is Worst movie or Most Overhyped movie of the Year.
I think with the critical acclaim this movie has been getting and all the nominations from the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, there is a sort of ""Emperor's clothes"" phenomenon.  Well, I'm telling you THIS EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES!  I wish the critics would open their eyes to this fact.  This film is absolutely dreadful.
I am sorry for all the people that have wasted both their time and money watching this film or buying it on DVD.  And that absolutely includes me.",1076371200,24,4088,4.56043956043956
1508605,5,B00005JMJ4,"In a film world of blatant and gratuitous violence, tasteless and shamless comedy, and pathetic writing and acting, this  movie simply would not appeal to many movie goers.

Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson act.  Acting is about conveying emotion without the necessity of gabbing endlessly.
This is a noisy and simplistic culture we live in, and this movie demands one's attention to get it.
It's not fast paced, it's not action packed, it's not ""explosive,"" it's not all about physical sex, it's not about simplistic answers to difficult stages people go through in their lives.
This movie also captures the essence of Asia.  Asia is a rich and powerful place of conflicting social forces that pull hard between centuries of tradition and the emerging modern/techno society.

1508606,5,B00005JMJ4,"The first time you realized that love was more than infatuation...  Your first kiss...  The alienation and emptiness of wasted love...
Life is full of epiphanies and moments that become mythical and hyperbolized in frequent memory replay.  These moments are factors of time and they pass persistently, and we are powerless to recapture them.  No movie in recent memory captures the reality of the passing moment and the alienation of a fish out of its proverbial cultural water better than Lost in Translation.
Each scene is like a living polaroid in a vacation album, each only making sense in context with the memories that accompany them.  While a relationship is the focal point, both people remain individual, alienated, but connected.  This is the beauty of this movie, it's ablility to realistically portray the honesty of human feelings within a dream-like setting of a very real location, Tokyo.  Tokyo itself becomes a character in this movie as Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) interact with the city, observe it, are dwarfed by its size, and are mesmerized by its oddities.
Sofia Coppola has crafted a script that passes like a ribbon in the breeze, moving in and out of conversations and moments, catching them in their candid happenings.  Scenes capture the lonely minutes and hours of the insomniac, the awkwardness of an abrupt introduction, the uncomfortability of a confrontation, all with the vague sense that, while this seems to be so dream-like, you are catching these moments in their raw honesty.  All of these individual moments string together into a story of feeling, rather than happening, being, rather than doing.
Coppola's work as Director is flawless, and the movie was perfectly cast in all of the parts, from Bill Murray as the washed-up actor and Scarlett Johansson as the soul-searching twentysomething, to the ensemble of Japanese, American, and other faces that enter into their world.  Murray resists the temptation to use his past work as a primer for the role, and instead, he takes us to depths of complexity that use his familiarity to the audience as well as his unique portrayal of an uncommon role to bring the audience into the experience of the character Bob Harris.
This movie can make you think of those unlikely memories that you rarely visit, and it takes the audience into the depths of a relationship that is so human in its complexity and so identifyable in its innocence.  Plus the soundtrack perfectly captures the feelings that the director attempts to ossify in the audience's memory.
That said, this movie isn't for everyone.  It blatantly bucks the traditional hollywood-type characterizations, and is therefore much more thorough, however slow, in building the characters around which the entire story revolves.  This could lose the interest of some viewers more accustomed to a typical popcorn flick, as well as viewers expecting a typical Bill Murray comedy.  It is actually somewhat of a disservice to the audience that this film was marketed as a comedy, since much of the humor is very subtle, and the movie overall does not seem like a vehicle for humor.  Humor is just one sarcastic lens through which Bill Murray's character processes his journey through this foreign world.
This movie contains scenes, such as the scene in the karaoke booth, which I believe will remain in the conscience of American cinema for a long time.  For this and all the above reasons, I highly recommend this movie for everyone who has felt like an outsider or had a whirlwind relationship that was greater for its brevity than it ever would have been at length.",1076284800,6,3629,5.003322259136213
1508607,3,B00005JMJ4,"Previous reviewers all seemed to hate or love this film.  I can sum it up by saying that those who loved it are probably impressed by a human interest / dialogue film with a wonderful premise, and those who hated it probably wanted more characterization and plot.
It is obvious that Sofia Coppola is shallow while surrounded by  richesse.  The female lead may be smart, but she only appears deep.  The character she seems to be would never have gone to those superficial parties.  Nothing she ever says shows any depth at all.  The fact that she is not as over-the-top idiotic as her husband's movie star friend does not make her wise.  The actress looked very pretty but did not have to do any difficult acting.
Neither did the marvelous Bill Murray.  Yes, I'd probably watch him read the phone book.  Yes, he captured PERFECTLY the spirit of ennui and frustration that his character called for.  I don't mind him winning awards for his job, but I don't think this role was his hardest work, either, if you know what I mean.
Tokyo was also shallowly characterized, as though she were just another superficial Coppola personage.
The best part of the movie for me was the relationship between the two of them.  I wish they hadn't been married, though, because it was not their marriages that determined the outcome.  It seemed very familiar, and I identified with her greatly.  There are a lot of reasons why 20-somethings and 50-somethings don't make for a long-term match, and the movie pointed these out.  Different stages of life attract as do opposites, though, and it makes for a good story.
I recommend watching this film without expecting to be blown away by anything about it.",1076284800,8,1684,4.703071672354949
1508608,2,B00005JMJ4,"I really wanted to like it. I love Bill Murray's acting but this movie never gets started...and maybe that's the point...but it's still no fun to watch.  It is a strangely compelling flick but in the same vein as a still life tableau.  I've also never been so aware of screen changes as I was with this movie, because the scenes don't seem to flow and instead come across as an arrhythmic collage with rather random syntax. With this in mind, it might be more satisfying to put the scenes from the movie on a PC as a screensaver! In the end, however, it would probably be as maddening as the movie. Given the awards frenzy, I just can't help but think that the public has been led down the garden path by the Hollywood establishment promoting one of its own.",1076284800,5,758,4.368794326241135

It is slow moving, that's true, but that's part of the charm - it conjures up an ethereal atmosphere in both the way Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson interact with each other and how they interact with the huge bustling city that surrounds them. The movie also slips and veers away from any expectations you have about ""formula"" romance movies. It's a unique experience (and I mean that, it's an experience more than a story), and I wanted to rewatch the movie again just hours after I'd seen it. Another great thing about this movie is that it DOES have a nice rewatchable factor to it, so it's one of those DVDs that won't just stick on your shelf and never be seen again.",1076284800,2,851,4.291925465838509

Now I'm not goin to argue that it is the best film ever made...but it was at the least my PERSONAL favorite.  My only complaint with the actual dvd is the changes which have been made from the original; seemingly small yes, still, significant enough to catch my eye.  One of the most noticeable changes: the music in the very last scene is different...although they still used a song from the original soundtrack, it's a different one, and it makes an enormous difference in the mood of the conclusion... i guess this just goes to show how much of a difference music can make in storytelling.

Sofia Coppola has finally stepped at least partially out of her fathers shadow. She has shaped a small but excellent cast into a top-notch movie, one of the best of the year. The characters are not able to (or maybe they have no desire to?) interact much with their foreign surroundings, so this movie can focus on the characters themselves, and their interactions with each other. The blossoming friendship (...romance?) is the main focus of the movie, and it is very entertaining to see it unfold.
This movie gets my highest recommendation. Some won't like it, and its subject matter won't appeal to others. But for most people, Lost in Translation will be a very worthwhile experience.",1076284800,3,908,4.753164556962025

The actors did a fine job.
Reading all the reviews it can be easily seen that there are those that like it, and those that hate it.
I watch a lot of foreign language films, and consider myself about as ""anti-Hollywood"" as they come.
But a move still comes down to getting a point across in a way that viewers can relate too; this one doesn't.
I saw two spoiled rich people that had more money than sense in this film.
I have traveled a lot, and if people go into a new culture as these two did, with the amounts of time and money that they appeared to have, and still could be so pitiable, I have no sympathy.
Some reviewers rave about the subtle message, but Harry Cohen of Columbia had a great line for this sort of thought: ""...if you want to deliver a message, send a telegram...""
He had a rule; the more his butt twitched in a chair, the worse it was:  This was a real tail-twister!
I wouldn't say not to watch it, because it does have redeeming aspects, but anyone that thinks this is a moumental achievement of film needs to go back to school.
I think Blade Runner captures more of the sense of isolation in a strange environmeent, and the disconnect of beings from life, than this did, and that is just one film off the top of my head.

Charlotte is in the same hotel, with her husband, but he is constantly working.  Bob and Charlotte meet a few times before really becomming friends, discussing family and life.  Scarlett Johannsen is perfect in this movie, and Bill Murray is simply amazing.

(It convincined me that I don't think I could bear to live in a Japanese city.  Maybe the countryside, definitely not the city!)

1508756,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" may be the most sophisticated American movie of 2003. It may also be the best. It is the kind of movie whose hierarchy in cinema history will be decided years from now. One thing that it is not is `mainstream'. Some viewers will be spellbound by it. Others will come away wondering why they wasted their time.
Part of the `problem' is that the story is like a minimalist painting - the viewer must fill in much of the details. A famous Hollywood star, Bob Harris [Bill Murray], travels to Tokyo to do some commercials for a Japanese whiskey manufacturer. All those time zones he has traveled through give him insomnia. Already ensconced at Bob's posh hotel is a young woman, Charlotte [Scarlett Johansson], who has traveled there with her husband [Giovanni Ribisi], a famous photographer. The husband must travel around Japan on assignment, leaving Charlotte on her own in Tokyo. Bob and Charlotte meet and have an affair which is far more spiritual than physical. When Bob's time in Japan is up, they both move on.
There is no raging sexual affair here. There is no moaning about how `bad' Bob and Charlotte's spouses are. [Bob's wife is back in California.] Both will return to the lives they have been living, albeit positively changed. To me, ""Lost in Translation"" is about those people we meet who profoundly change our lives, no matter how brief the encounter may be.",1076198400,2,1395,4.768595041322314

Scarlett's performance is like a long, slow Calvin Klein commercial, and Bill Murray - and I am a big fan - simply chose the wrong script.  That's assuming there was a script because that would imply that something, anything, developed in this movie.  It didn't.
The movie ended as it began - with everyone in my family room wondering what the movie would be about.  When the credit's ran, there was a long silence in my house, people sipped their wine, avoided eye contact, until finally someone couldn't hold it anymore and snorted a laugh out their nose, which started the only noteworthy moment of emotion during the evening.  I've been laughing with Bill Murray for years - I've just never laughed at him before.
I guess if you went to art school this might be an interesting example of an understated love story intertwined in the human condition or something, but if you work and do laundry and drive kids to school like me, it's just a waste of two hours, which in my world is huge.
My wife paid $14 for this movie and I will gladly take 14 cents for it.  Any takers?

Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a recent Yale graduate in philosophy, is isolated by her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) as he is constantly away on photo shoots.  In her seclusion she begins to question her life and her place in the world as she is detached from people she can communicate with.  Bob's and Charlotte's crisis is accentuated by jet-lag and insomnia which draws them to the hotel bar where their paths intersect and lead to a week long beginning for both of them to reconnect with life and their existence.

Im not going to get into a philosophical rant, but this shows a relationship that doesnt need sex, and still is a strong and caring relationship with unconditional feelings (the only thing I could get from when Bill Murry is with the older chick).  It also has to do with what I feel how things don't last forever.  Regardless, this is an awesome movie, if you understand and love to search for meaning.  If you like a straight to the point story, you won't like it.

Essentially, they just hung out and engaged in stilted small talk for most of the movie, neither of them coming remotely close to exposing their feelings.
Oh sure, ""non-verbally"" they both communicated their situations to the audience, but aren't people going through existential crises supposed to TALK TO EACH OTHER?  All I wanted was for just one little conversation between them that had any depth at all.  I kept thinking it would happen but it never did. (Bill Murrary's character whispered something in her ear during the last scene but since we don't know what it was I'm assuming it also had no depth - probably a knock knock joke or something like that.)

This film reminds me of the best work of Eric Rohmer (Summer and Pauline at the Beach, for example) or even the Antoine Doinel films from Truffault.  When the film ended I felt a bit happier about humanity, and made me appreciate the wonders of a strong marriage (mine is 20+ years and still terrific.)  Rohmer. Truffault and Sofia Coppola all love their characters and it shows in every scene.  The result is a movie in which every moment rings true.  Murray and Johansson come across like people in the real world, not like characters in a movie.  And when they do the right thing at the end of the film (we don't know exactly what Murray says, but we know for sure it is the right thing), we realize that we would have done the same, because deep down that is just how most of us are.
So why do some folks detest this film?  The people I know who didn't like it would also be put off by a Rohmer film.  Nothing happens, except nice people behave like nice people.  Why see a movie when this is all that happens?  For me, it is to think a bit more about ourselves, our relationships, and humanity.  Maybe some folks don't need to think about these things.  But I do, and I relish this film for inspiring warm thoughts.

I hardly think this movie would be embraced by American film-goers if it was shot with the same screenplay, same director, same cast but under the premise of a European actor coming to Hollywood to shoot a commercial.  How would Americans feel if this actor walked into an elevator with a bunch of morbidly obese people stuffing french fries in their mouth?  Its this type of movie that cements stereotypes into people's head.  Sophia Coppola is a racist.  I hope the Academy does not honor her and this film.

This movie is very contemplative, it relies a lot on the spectator bonding with the characters, a thing that takes time to achieve. I remember thinking it was a good thing I was seeing this movie it in the theatre, as opposed to DVD/VHS; some parts seemed slow enough to tempt to hit fast-forward. Don't; they are as essential as any other part in that movie; they help relate to the characters on an emotional level that made the movie so incredibly rewarding in the end. I would say that as the two charactes develop their relatiopnship, so does the viewer with them and ultimately with the movie; in the end you might find yourself completely enamored with it.
I think this is a movie about many things: interpersonal communication, the feeling of alienation or the need to belong, the relativity of an individual's perceived value according to the circumstances. Had the characters met in LA instead of Tokio, maybe none would have paid attention to the other.

Essentially Bill Murray, a washed-up actor doing tiresome whiskey endorsements in Japan, forms a unlikely frienship with an equally disaffect recent college graduate/bored wife in Scarlett Johanson. The movie does not particularly progress from here, other than to try to offer up a ""slice of life"" as these two sometimes hang out, other times don't, in a strange land.
The film is carried by a spot-on Bill Murray, who could not look more weary and subtley sarcastic in this film, the charismatic Scarlett Johansson, and the sensory overload of Tokyo itself. Tokyo provides a lot of material for Murray and Johansson to work off of, and they do it well. Though you do not laugh out loud much, the movie does enjoy a great chuckling sense of humor throughout, and a genuine heart in the shared emptyness of Murray and Johansson contrasted with the pounding insistence of Tokyo.  There is no true plot, just a slight joy in sharing this unusual experience with the characters. Not everyone will like this movie, and if you choose not to invest yourself in the characters, you will bored senseless. But it is a film that can be rewarding.

If they are reminded people they can fast forward, they obviously know we don't care about the previews, right? So why torment us?). 2.

It deservingly garnered three Golden Globe wins (Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay) and four Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay).  Its plot of an American actor popular in the 1970's who finds peace in Japan is brilliant and original.  The emotional aspects are heavily present, namely Bob Harris (Murray) being away from his family and Charlotte (Johansson) becoming increasingly lonely due to her husband not being present often.  The combination of the two storylines come together smoothly, especially when the two characters become soulmates.  The dramatic aspects keep audience interested in every moment.  Such movie quality marks director Sofia Coppola at her career best so far.  Bill Murray marks a triumphant comeback in this movie.  Though well known as a comedian, he shines in this dramatic role.  No other actor could have performed his role better.  Scarlett Johansson marks a brilliant career launcher in her role.  She proves that she'll continue becomine well-known as a wonderful actress in the future.  ""Lost In Translation"" is great for those looking for an original drama.

As movie craft, the only continuity in this film is established in the beginning when Bill Murray arrives in Tokyo for a brief acting gig and at the end of the film when he prepares for his departure. If every other scene filmed were represented as a playing card, any film editor in the world could reshuffle the deck, turn the cards over and come up with the same random film.  Shots of Murray sitting in a bar.  Shots of Johannson looking out a window. Shots of both talking on the phone. Shots of a brilliantly lighted techno-neon Tokyo. Shots of colorful fast talking Japanese personalities expressing themselves in a manner generally incoherent to the average Westerner. Shots of Murray and Johansson talking to or at one another, and mostly wistfully at that. Both characters have issues of loneliness and that's all they have in common, except that they are wealthy enough to share the same upscale hotel experience while staying in Tokyo.

Not a good recommendation ...and yet I certainly cannot say that I didn't like it, or even greatly admire the skilled photography and, yes, direction. I'm just not sure I get the point.
Bill Murray plays a disaffected American actor who comes to Japan to make a $2 million commercial touting a Japanese brand of whiskey. Oh no, Bill has sold out. His angst tells the tale as he suffers through the shoot and then through a number of publicity stills destined to make the sides of buses throughout Tokyo. In the middle of this he meets an equally disaffected young wife (Scarlett Johansson)who is in Japan accompanying her photgrapher husband. We know she is unhappy because she spends at least half her time sitting on the window ledge in her hotel room, looking out at the scenery.
Bill and Scarlett meet. They share their angst and their snide humor, mostly aimed at the Japanese. They also bond and have some fun. Story drags on.
I do see why Sofia Coppola has been rewarded for her superb direction; there are no superfluous scenes, everything is flawless, Tokyo is shown at its best and is skillfully used as anoter major character in the film.
Watching the extra material, however, is painful, at least for me. We have a long long long look at pre-production and the early days of shooting, where we meet much of the senior crew on the film. We have a mediocre video. We DO, however, get to see more of a hilarious, funky Japanese TV show, upon which Bill Murray guests in the film. That's almost worth the price of the DVD. I did not watch the deleted scenes or the interview with Bill and Sofia--I had seen enough of each of them on the pre-production segment, and I didn't want the memory of deleted scenes to spoil my pleasure in the editing of the film itself.
Enough said. I would probably have given this film three and a half stars if there was such a thing; it's worth seeing, but not a masterpiece.",1076198400,3,2016,4.466124661246613
1508970,5,B00005JMJ4,"I just finished watching this movie, which I bought on the strength of my friends' critiques. I must say that this is definitely one of the more unique movies I have seen in a long time, and were it not for his past in Hollywood, Bill Murray would win an Oscar for Best Actor. No lying--I just ACTUALLY typed that.
This is easily Murray's greatest performance. His look of apathy and off-the-cuff commentary are somewhat subdued in this movie, which gives his character (Bob, the washed-up actor) a geniune feel. He is also able to convey Bob's loneliness very easily. The moviegoers KNOW that Bob is a defeated and lonely man: even while on vacation, he is constantly bothered by his wife (whom he no longer loves), and his washed-up career further adds to his dismal situation. One of the more intriguing characters in cinema the last couple of years.
Johansson is delightful in this movie. She gives an undeniably good performance here, but what sold me on her was her way with little things, especially facial expressions (a hint of a smile or a biting of her lip add depth to her character). The scenes that require her to actually ACT (the solo scenes in her apartment or her wandering thru Tokyo) are also well-done. She sold me on her character by simply becoming her: as she lies in bed with Murray, you can sense the feeling of uneasiness and isolation in her. She's worried about her future, but she is not alone--Murray, and the rest of us, understand and share her feelings.
Coppola - who directed this with an intriguing focus on environment - has a great movie on her hands. She has little more than a hotel and two characters to work with--but she somehow manages to make it interesting. ""A viewer"" said this movie was boring, but I must disagree with him/her: the viewer is sold on both characters from the moment they see them, and this keeps the viewer enthralled. One can sense a feeling of warmth and caring beneath Bob's weathered exterior, and Charlotte, as a friend said, has a ""girl next door"" appeal to her--but in no way does she come off as naive. These are both easy sells for the viewer--a fact which can be attributed to Coppola's ability to develop the characters in a minimalist fashion.
So to conclude, the acting is superb (Johannson and Murray are wonderful in their roles) and the directing is just as good. It also has its funny moments, but its usually serious. Somehow, Coppola was able to take a foreign hotel and two characters and make it entertaining. And thats where the charm of ""Lost in Translation"" lies: while the message is understood by all and the movie is no grand production, it resonates with the audience on a level that few other movies have.",1076198400,3,2699,4.625
1508971,4,B00005JMJ4,"The first thing that struck me about 'Lost in Translation' was the fact that the whole film focuses on 'THE moment', and at that, it is startingly thought-provoking. The moment of intercultural interaction struggle, when you don't know whether to feel amused, upset or uncomfortable. The moment of utter alienation, when, explosively, you get away from everyday problems and get immersed into the unknown. The moment of reflection. The moment of reciprocal appreciation between two beings.
Two despondent Americans are passing time in Japan - the middle-aged man (Murray) is working on an international photo-shoot, and the young woman (Johansson)is married to an erratic photographer and is deciding what she wants from her life. They meet one night at the bar, and talk, about nothing, yet what immediately unites them is a mutual strive for self-fulfillment, the lack of which is accentuated in a faraway city filled with so many unique traditions. Intoxicated by the radical diversity, and spellbound by each other's company, the two characters go through a revelatory redemption.
 Simplicity is the key in this contemplative motion picture, wrongly advertised as a comedy (neither is it a 'modern day Lolita). 'Lost in Translation' does have its share of hilarity, most apparent in scenes of Bill Murray trying to communicate with the various directors, talk show hosts and karaoke singers. While slightly astounded by the militant ethnic disparity, Bill Murray is never offensive in his reactions to frankly eccentric individuals - he is flabbergasted by it. In truth, the film is about its two protagonists, suspended in vacuum, face-to-face with disaffection. As genuine as Copolla's sensible, minimalist approach is, their attraction cannot be described as sexual- it's candidly longing, and hence the age difference is neglected.  There is little dialogue, little action, little plot - but we confront and go along with the movie, because it efficiently discovers a tone that swathes us.
 Believe the hype - you will fall in love with the marvelous Murray, gorgeous Johannson and candor of this simple yet tremendously heartwarming, truly magical film.",1076112000,,2162,5.352941176470588

Scarlett Johansson is accompanying her photographer husband, the talented Giovanni Ribisi who is also working in Tokyo.  She is trying to find her niche in life and is bored with the culture shock that Japan represents.  Johansson and Murray strike up a friendship and become companions sojourning through the city.  They eventually develope fond yet platonic feelings for each other.

1508975,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation provides Bill Murray with an ideal role, playing a washed up actor making a commercial in Tokyo for a quick buck.  He's been married forever and is growing increasingly emotionally aloof; however, something tells him that he's not happy.  Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a young woman who's been married to her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) for two years.  She recently completed college and feels lost, with no idea where she fits into the world.  Somehow these two confused souls find each other amidst the jumble of Tokyo and form an unlikely bond.
People may go into this movie with many misconceptions, particularly thinking it's a typical Bill Murray comedy. You'll likely chuckle a few times but there are few riotously funny scenes, although I did laugh pretty hard when Murray encounters the ""Premium Fantasy woman.""  Likewise, the pace is measured and some of the scenes may seem unnecessary, as they seem to add more to the tone of the movie than the plot; stick with this movie despite it's languorous pace.  Ultimately, Lost in Translation is a genre-defying movie - part drama, part broad comedy, part black comedy, part romance, and so forth.  However, what it does remind me of the most is a classic 1940s movie - Brief Encounter; both are understated romances whereby two people meet tenuously and find hope.
I really disliked Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, the amateurish Virgin Suicides.  However, she is in full control of her craft in this movie.  She's found a unique voice that astutely addresses the disaffection and isolation so many of us feel in the modern world.  Justifiably, she's become the first American woman to be nominated for Best Director by the Academy Awards and only the third woman in history to receive this honor.  In addition to the superior direction, Bill Murray is outstanding, balancing his natural talents in comedy and pathos luminously.  Overall, I most highly recommend this movie.

sadly we were duped.  the movie begins with promise there are a few rather humorous scenes in regards to the culture but that is it.  all hopes for the movie to pick up are dashed when the leads finally do meet halfway trough the film. the rest of the film is simply spent folowing them through kareoke bars and strip clubs. the entire film says nothing and the only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the always exceptional acting from bill and hopes that somehow the movie would end up saying somthing of interest.
i think Gregory Weinkauf of NEW TIMES describes this movie, or lack there of, the best, ""When work this potentially satisfying remains flatly obvious, it's almost worse than being flat-out bad.""",1076112000,8,873,4.625806451612903
1508978,2,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola's previous feature, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, received widespread praise, yet was one of the most banal movies ever shot on 35mm film.  Her second feature, LOST IN TRANSLATION, has received even more critical praise, plus 3 Golden Globe awards and Oscar nominations for best picture, screenplay, director, and actor.  Surely it must merit such accolades?
  Alas, it does not.  Although better than her previous turkey, LOST is yet another vapid distraction dolled up with multi-million dollar production values and A-list stars.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deserve praise for making something out of nearly nothing.  Their performances add some soul to characters whom the script paints as nothing more than bland types, devoid of singularity, identity, or development--paltry clichs at best.  They even manage to convey a sense of epiphany in their final scene together, which hinges on an utterly unintelligible line he mutters into her ear.  (Even captioning on the DVD reports it as ""Whispering, indistinct.""  Perhaps he said something like, ""Is this a new low for Deus ex machina--God rescuing the screenwriter instead of the hero?"")

  Since the story is obviously not about character, or conflict, or action, perhaps it is about ennui.  Unfortunately Ms Coppola does not understand the imitative fallacy in art.  The pace drags, with more than half an hour spent establishing the characters' alienation and boredom--already adequately established in the film's opening minutes.  In more skilled hands, the material implicit in the story might make a good feature length movie.  As is, it might make a good 20 minute short.  Too bad the film lasts 104 minutes.  (Yawn.)
  Though failing as story, the movie might succeed in what film is really about anyway-visual imagery.  It does boast a capable cinematographer, Lance Acord (of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH fame), and was filmed on location in Japan, offering a wealth of opportunity for exotic, beautiful, interesting images.  Acord delivers some nice shots of Tokyo's pulsating lights, a Buddhist monastery, and temple grounds in Kyoto, for instance, and he even makes a hotel pool momentarily interesting.  But the script mostly confines him to banal urban interiors and clogged city streets, not much different wherever you go in the world.  We have seen it all before (including the gratuitous nudity), and there is nothing in this movie to make us want to see it again.  (Sigh.)
  Finally, since the story focuses on two Yanks adrift in Japan, Japan itself plays a major role in the film.  Sadly, Ms Coppola offers no insight into Japanese culture, character, or values, presenting only superficial glimpses reinforcing well-worn stereotypes:  Japanese talk funny, adulate Westerners, sing karaoke, bow frequently, eat strange food, play video games, etc.  (Ho-hum.)
  LOST IN TRANSLATION gets 2 stars out of 5-both for the acting.  One star for Bill Murray, at last recognized for the dramatic ability in evidence since MEATBALLS (and blatantly obvious since MAD DOG AND GLORY).  The other for the rest of the cast: Johansson (believable though out of her element), Ribisi (perfect as the adolescent, self-absorbed husband), and Faris (the ditzy blonde starlet-at least I think she was acting).  And to the critics who praised this movie (and Ms Coppola's previous lame effort), I give a big, fat goose egg.",1076112000,2,3382,5.25607476635514
1509066,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is an amazing achievement for the director Sofia Coppola and the actors Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. The film plays like one long beautiful dream of friendship and shared experiences in an alternate universe.
The film's plot is simple. Two Americans-a mid-50's, washed up actor played by Bill Murrray and a young, married Yale graduate played by Johansson-find themselves lost in Tokyo for a week. They're not really lost of course: Murray is there to shoot a TV commercial and Johansson to accompany her hip photographer husband. But being set adrift in the bright lights of Tokyo makes each realize how lost they are in their own lives. Murray's character is going through a classic mid-life crisis while Johansson's character is undergoing a more unusual beginning of life crisis.
They connect in the hotel bar after seeing each other at various venues. Slowly and subtly a lovely, amazing friendship develops. They are at the same stage of their lives emotionally if not chronologically. And that's the beauty of the movie: how at a disparate moment of time, two souls can connect on an emotional and not a physical level.
The frenzy of Tokyo day and night life provides a powerful counterpoint to the slowly unfolding friendship. Coppola has an amazing eye for the scenes and sights that tell a story--she gives you just enough of the neon lights and just enough of the green zen gardens to make you feel as if you are in Tokyo.
I would recommend this movie to those individuals who gravitate towards intelligent, art house films. Yes Bill Murray does his deadpan schtick here: but it reveals the darker undertones that perhaps were always there.
The DVD featurettes are good (you want more), particularly a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola. The deleted scenes include more from Anna Faris, who turns in an outstanding supporting performance as a young and ditzy actress turned loose in Tokyo, whose experience could not be more dissimilar to Murray and Johansson's.

1509067,4,B00005JMJ4,"First of all, this movie is not ""slap your knees"" hilarious. It is a subtle comedy with humor implied by a passing glance such as it in reality.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen are terrific together.  The main character is Bob Harris(Bill Murray), a past his hay-day actor and is ""lost in life's translation"" as he cruises through life. He chooses to further his career by doing a whiskey ad for the Japanese.
 Bob Harris is disenchanted with life in general& the choices he's made such as his young counterpart, Scarlett Johansen's character, Charlotte. Both are married to different people, stuck in situations where no one understands them, and are truely lonely. The choices they have made in life created the kind of lonely that makes a crowded room full of people you know seem foreign.  The film creates this moment in time feeling that fate meant for these two characters to meet and realise that they are not alone. Even though they are ""strangers"" they recognize that they are soul mates.

1509069,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is a wonderful movie. It is a well put together, beautiful piece of art worthy of the praise it has received. It is also a ringing indictment of the world in which we find ourselves.
Simply put--humanity, both collectively and as individuals, has a void which it is incapable of filling. We strive after multitudes of things to fill this gap--to block out, however temporarily the foreboding sense that there must be more to life. These things, be they products, people, jobs, or crusades for one issue or another, always fail to put an end to the void--to give us meaning.
As time passes whole cultures are becoming frenetic in the energy they expend to try and narcoticize themselves to this fact of human reality. Things speed up. People disconnect from each other and abandon true community. We are satiated with the latest consumer goods and electronic gadgets.
Lost in Translation is the story of two people struggling with the holes in their lives, the inhumanity of the cultures in which they live, and the wounds that they bear as a result.
Charlotte and Bob (played brilliantly by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray respectively) are two lost souls who find each other while being doubly ""lost"" in a foreign land. This at first sounds like the plot for a standard romantic comedy (especially with Murray involved), yet Lost in Translation, in its fiercely honest portrayal of the lonely brokenness of the human condition, transcends its genre.
Though darkly comic in parts, Lost in Translation hits the nail on the head in dealing with humanity's proclivity for compromising everything to try and fill our emptiness (which only leaves us more empty). There are a thousand clichd questions that this movie begs one to ask; not least of which is: `whether it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?' (Not that anyone `loses' here...but that brings up another whole series of questions.)
But what strikes me as pertinent here is that neither Charlotte nor Bob was happy before their relationship begins bringing up all these questions in the viewer's mind. Bob's marriage sucks. So does Charlotte's. However, one senses that even before this these characters were looking for greater meaning. Bob has fruitlessly sought fulfillment from his work. Charlotte studied philosophy and tried writing (which left her just as empty as Bob).
Could it be that while we pity the plight of poor Charlotte and Bob that we are missing a wake-up call (or perhaps in this case wake-up curtains) of our own? The catalyst for Bob and Charlotte's misery in Lost in Translation is that they are together in a place they both see as foreign, over-stimulated and in many ways incomprehensible.
Yet being lost and unhappy in a foreign land is nothing exceptional compared to how most of us live our daily lives. Bob and Charlotte could run off and live in New York with each other-though nothing would change. We, like Charlotte and Bob, know we are disconnected. We know we are lost. On top of it all, we are caught up in the imagination and lifestyle of lands created by people drowning in their own terrible voids of doubt and meaninglessness-people who never had the strength to swim.
The greatest gift of Lost in Translation is that it shows `reality' for what it really is: a monumental lack of imagination and a false construct overlaying the possibility of a true life just waiting to be found.
The truth of this movie, though perhaps only implied, is this:
Not many of us are wise. Not many of us are strong. Yet when we grow still, when our struggles cease, there is a weakness stronger than our strength, foolishness wiser than our years. In the silence it lifts us up.

It's kind of funny, everyone I know who likes this film is a Vin Diesel fan - they all like Triple X and the Fast and the Furious and this movie. Now, you may say, what do those movies have in common?
Well, they all subvert intelligence in favor of looks. This movie plays heavily (entirely) on the fact that Americans (I am one myself) are easily, like Nebraskans going to New York City for the first time, blown away by Tokyo. So basically, all you have to do is throw a bunch of flashy shots of Tokyo on the screen, and guar-un-teed, people will sit there with their jaws gaping going ""This is amazing!""
Well my friends. I have lived in many different countries around the world and it takes more than some Roppongi glitz or Shinjuku eminence to impress me. No offense to others who are impressed.
Secondary to Tokyo (Tokyo may as well be billed as the main actor) is the handcart of bittersweet conventions pushed through the movie. Yawn. This movie feels like I've seen it before. Oh yes, I have, it's much like any other lovers in a foreign city movie. Bill Murray plays a sad, black humorous, defeated old man, much like Jack Nicholson did in About Schmidt. These sad old men rules are always shoo-ins for the big awards, I'm wondering why anyone can't see through this.
Film school students will talk your ear off about what all those wistful shots of people doing nothing mean. What it means is this movie is boring and film school students like to be pretentious. Yawn.

I know, I know, I DARED, that's right, I DARED to give this film one-star, so I know everyone has to get hysterical with outrage and click ""Not Helpful.""

1509073,5,B00005JMJ4,"This movie is brilliant. There is no other word to describe ""Lost In Translation"", the somber journey of two lonely people who become friends in the neon lights of Tokyo while they kill time until they can return home to the US. Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this gem, and she has created a quiet, sublime film that gets the point across not through endless chatter, but poignant dialogue that only comes out when it needs to. There is much in her style that comes from her famous father, but she makes it into her own, and she is unbelievably good at it. This is her second film, and it is even better than ""The Virgin Suicides"", which was also an exceptional film. She will be a force to be reckoned with on the film scene for years to come, as she has an undeniable talent.
Much has to be said about the acting in this movie, because the performances from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen are top-notch. Murray was nominated for an Oscar for this performance, and it is much deserving, because it is the best of his long career. The fact that Johanssen was not nominated is a travesty, but she is only 18 and has a long, promising career in front of her. Both of them work so well together, taking advantage of the simply written script and making the most out of every delicious line and nuance that Coppola has put into her work. The third major character in this movie has to be the city of Tokyo itself, and the director captures it and its strangeness perfectly.

1509174,3,B00005JMJ4,"good movie, that's worth seeing but with what i thought were odd problems -- ok, just odd for me.
the movie centers around Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a hollywood actor now past his prime who finds himself in Japan doing a whisky commercial for easy money.
arriving in Tokyo, he is jetlagged and blinks at the high tech pulse of city (reminded me a bit of Blade Runner with the electronic ads) and the very surface problem of verbal translation as his horrendously bad translator relays dialogue between him and the director of the commmerical.
finding some refuge in the nightclub/lounge in his posh hotel, he catches the eye of Charlotte (Scarlett Johanson), a newlywed to a photographer on assignment in Japan. she feels displaced because her husband is never around and there is no emotional anchor that ties her to Tokyo; her plea to her friend at the start of the movie describing going to a shrine and feeling nothing quickly establishes her disassociation.
Bob and Charlotte quickly develop an affinity for each other that goes beyond being Americans in Japan... but more likely that they are both adrift in their relationships -- the term soulmates comes to mind.
i am reminded of moments of my own trip to Japan three years ago, many of the familiar places, the kinship felt among visitors to a foreign land and other foreign tourists... but there are things that definitely is jarring and seem implausible.
how Charlotte (who doesn't work and is a 'sophisticate') can afford a posh hotel on an assignment photographer is beyond me. the day trips to Kyoto and wherever Bob teed off are unlikely -- Kyoto isn't all that easy to navigate and you lose over four hours just sitting on the shinkansen; meanwhile Mt. Fuji is barely visible from Tokyo so you do the math. neither Bob nor Charlotte spoke Japanese, which becomes an issue outside of Tokyo proper. two side trips that really didn't serve the movie in a meaningful way and seemed like orphaned scenes.
i know many viewers feel this movie rings true to being a tourist -- simply put being concious of being foreign. i agree and gave this movie three stars but i felt that the overall issue of cultural displacement, the path of the movie and the dialogue were all done in a more effective way in the movie Barcelona.",1076025600,,2279,4.714285714285714
1509175,5,B00005JMJ4,"Perhaps the key to liking this movie is to be patient. By the end of the movie, I was convinced that Sofia Coppola deserves every accolade she gets. It is her patience in letting this story tell itself through well-paced action and stingy dialogue that lends such a deep palette of emotional color to the movie. As a writer, she shows a discipline of concision that T.S. Eliot could only get from his friend and part-time editor Ezra Pound. As a director, she allows the camera to dwell long enough on every situation to extract a high degree of clarity, and manages the actors' looks and positions to beautifully complement and emphasize their great ability to show emotional depth. I was truly impressed with her abilities as both a screenwriter and director.
 Coppola's exploration of viewing as a trope is a powerful element of the film. She beautifully juxtaposes her highly visible characters with their feelings of inconsequence. She accomplishes this through her slowly revealing narrative and rich cinematography. As affluent white visitors, they are easily seen in Tokyo. In Bob Harris's case, not only does his fame attract attention, but so do cinematographic elements like his wardrobe (the clips on the back of his tuxedo jacket) and the composition of his height in shots like the elevator scenes. For Charlotte, it is her beauty, marriage to a globe-trotting photographer and familiarity with New York and L.A. lifestyles that marks her. The camera's attention to her half-clothed body from the title scene to near the end establishes that these characters' visibility is an intimate one for the audience. The pervading close-ups of both characters reinforce a high degree of audience voyeurism.
 It is with this understanding of viewing as a powerful trope in the movie that the title becomes so meaningful. Translation is, of course, a form of viewing the unfamiliar. And whether the translation is being done by one person or through an intermediary, the existence of the untranslatable is always a moment for introspection. The incomprehensibility of a statement or emotion (or any sign) calls into question the mental and emotional faculties of the person who is attempting to translate. Bob Harris is intensely interested in accurate translation, as his scene shooting the whiskey commercial attests, but so often, as with his relationship with his wife, he tires of translation's inherent difficulties and comedically capitulates. His coping mechanism shuts off introspection. Charlotte, on the other hand, is just coming to grips with translation as a mode fraught with difficulty. She copes by trying again and again, whether by visiting monasteries in attempt to ""feel"" something or by trying to find a profession. Her coping mechanism invites introspection. By combining these two characters, at two very divergent points in their lives, with opposite ages and genders, sharing a common daily alienation of translation and introspection, Coppola creates a dynamic narrative that reveals itself in silences and incremental emotional clues that the characters give one another through looks and touches. It is clear what gets translated effectively: their emotional connection and affection for one another. Certainly the mode of showing affection to one another is more difficult for them to translate, and the ebb and flow of restrained sexual energy is positively mastered by Murray and Johannsen. But Coppola reveals that what is truly lost in translation are the closest relationships we all share with our loved ones. The most over-translated relationship is that with the spouse, where meaning is truly glossed over.
Coppola gives us two distinct modes of spousal mistranslations. Bob's is a subtle one, where 25 years' worth of translated meaning resides in the spoken and unspoken relationship-weighing on Bob so heavily that only mundane discussions can be tolerated. These subtle mistranslations act like smooth rocks-they do not cause noticeable turbulence alone, but if considered as a whole, can divert a river of meaning between husband and wife. Charlotte's lost translation with her husband is still new, a product of projecting desires onto one's spouse, which they both do. And while their spouses are both strikingly absent, their alone time, their time of introspection, is spent translating who their spouses are and why they are with them. Interestingly, Charlotte's experience of the Tokyo world (which is concentrated in her sexual energy) is as subtle and inscrutable as the cause of the mistranslations in Bob's marriage, while Bob's experience of the Tokyo world contains glaring mistranslations that mirror Charlotte's marriage. It is therefore no surprise that they are attracted to one another. Even Bob's infidelity with the laughable lounge singer doesn't destroy a relationship based more on unconscious soulful affiliation than surface attraction.
Let's hope Lost in Translation doesn't get lost in the hype. Is it groundbreaking? I think so, but not in the way one might expect. From Greek tragedy to today, we have touchstones of human emotion like hubris, anger, jealousy and humor. This movie has somehow evaded the predictable reduction of many movies to these emotional touchstones. This is not ""older man meets younger woman and they escape moral turpitude by not consummating their affection."" It is an emotional landscape of shared introspection that could only happen so clearly on the screen because of their isolation, visibility and, paradoxically, their opposite situations in life. Their own moral codes interact with the foreign and liberal atmosphere of Tokyo as a party town in a way that resists easy reduction into good/bad, folly/wisdom. They both learn from the other's revelation of thoughts about himself or herself. The audience is given the ability to experience the space of shared introspection and the doubts and triumphs that it entails. Thank you to Sofia Coppola for bringing us a movie that does something different and meaningful.",1076025600,9,6024,5.300209205020921
1509176,5,B00005JMJ4,"Any movie goer or video renter, who watches romance dramas or romantic comedies knows that the formula of every mainstream romance is the same: lovers meet, fall in love, usually have great sex, argue, break up, and get back together--and a Natalie Cole song more than likely ""This Will Be"" plays during the end credits. And we all know in reality that love isn't usually like that and meeting people and connecting with people is always a little deeper and more complex. And Sofia Coppola knows this too. Although its sometimes fun to watch random movie stars thrown together, not based on on-screen chemistry but more on reaching broader demographics, go through the trials and tribulations of love and romance. It's also enlightening and even more fun to watch films where two people trapped in their own private miseries bond in a foreign country for a week long odysessy of late night chats at bars, karaoke parties, and strip joints. That's the beauty that Coppola brings in Lost in Translation, a dreamy escape into the unique bond between hotel loners: Bob, an unhappily married, aging movie star in a mid life crisis played with sweet charm by Bill Murray and Charlotte a young wife struggling to find her place in the world played gracefully by Scarlett Johannson. Their connection is so endearing niether of them can explain it and they never dwell on the mechanics of it and Coppola never throws in a cheap Lolita-esque plot twist. The story is really shaped around two lost souls finding comfort in the other's company.
Lost In Translation is a love letter to the mysterious ways people find each other in their most needful times and how attraction isn't always centered around sexual desire but perhaps a sense of longing or wonder about the possibilities of ""what if"" and the intimacy of the unsaid.

1509180,5,B00005JMJ4,"This movie perfectly captures the feeling of being lost in another country, with nothing to ground you. I spent 4 years teaching English in Japan, and this is the first movie I've ever seen that conveys what it's like to live there--without condescension and without snickering. (And I lived out in the countryside, which still retains more traditions than Tokyo.) The movie manages to capture the soul of Japan on screen in all its oddness, without ever making fun. There it all is: the pachinko parlors, the giant video screens, the exercise machines that talk to you, the karaoke boxes, and it all comes across as merely different, as Japan's unique adaptation of what it learned from the West. Even the quiet scenes in Kyoto, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, showed the peace and serenity that you can still find in many places in Japan.
Without this careful background of the viewer becoming ""lost"" in another culture from the beginning of the movie, the ""lost"" characters might have been a little too familiar. The girl who married too young; the middle-aged man facing crisis in his life. But I've seen marriages break up in Japan, and I've seen ex-pats stay for 20, 25 years, living in the demimonde that's half gai(koku)jin bars and half familiarity with everything Japanese. Things change in that neon light and circumscribed space (both physical and cultural), and Sophia Coppola does an amazing job of teasing out how you really DON'T always take yourself with you wherever you go.

1509183,5,B00005JMJ4,"'Lost in Translation' is a very layered work of film art that is hard for most to come to grip with.  On the surface it appears to be one thing; lonely husband and wife of different ages find they have lonliness in common in Tokyo and grow friendship.  But, this film is so much craftier.  Sophia did her homework, and the critics and sceptics haven't hit the nail on the head yet.
Ms. Coppola makes a stunning ode to Tokyo with her very scant story covering lush visuals filmed totally within Japan.  It is a work of love to a culture vastly different from the west, yet so similar in most esoteric ways.  The writing/direction made the general American audiences fall in love with the story of two people who find their 'soulmate' in a city where everything moves at a different tempo and style from the main characters.  Frankly, this could have been shot anywhere; city people stuck in red-neck America, or earth tone dressers caught in the all-black NYC/LA of today, or beet growers working in a town of cattle barons.  The story is basically showing two people so divorced from those around them that they become similar.  The choice of Tokyo allows Sophia to protray a city/country so few can portray due to the cultural gap.
However, her story is the biggest, mad trick on the audience.  Sophia engages audiences to believe and love two characters who, while charming in themselves, are spoiled, pampered souls.  Charolotte and Bob (Johnasen and Murray) are basically taking the easy way out in a world where their better halves are working and striving to secure futures, homes and families, and these two primaries are unable to sleep or function in their plush cages within Tokyo.  It expemplifies the saying 'Idle hands do the Devils work.'  With time and boredom comes frustration and sin.  While charming and sweet, Ms. Coppola examines this rather one trick relationship by showing that the characters only have one thing in common, and despite their 'love' there isn't a lot that would bind them aside from the fact that they share ilde lonliness.
On so many levels, this rather slow, indulgent film displays an amazing depth of character writing and a boldness of film and timing I haven't seen for years.  Granted, this film isn't a timeless masterpiece, but it is a very perochial masterpiece due to the amount of sadly typical films that spew the market in America.  All the negatives people display in reviews are actually positives.  All the postive reviews merely back the adept writing/film making of 'Translation'.  It is a really great film to see and dwell on.  While it isn't a film for everyone, it is a film for many, and is a unique experience for most.

1509290,4,B00005JMJ4,"The first image in writer-director Sofia's Coppola's Lost in Translation gets your attention - -  Charlotte's behind in her underwear as she lies in bed.  Charlotte, barely out of her teens, is in her underwear most of the time she spends in the Tokyo hotel room where she waits for her photographer husband to notice her.
You soon see that Charlotte's equally young husband is an idiot (insipid conversation about rock musicians, gullibility when a Sarah Michelle Gellar clone tells how her father fought on the ""American side at the Bay of Pigs"" and came back an anorexic).  While philosophy grad Charlotte is brighter than her husband, she shares one thing with him - -  she's no more emotionally mature than he is.
In one scene Charlotte and her husband  (writing this, I can't remember his name) are in their hotel room.  He's sitting on the floor, surrounded by cameras and expensive photo equipment (his toys) while Charlotte wiggles past him in her underwear, throwing a scarf she's been knitting around her neck, playing dress-up.  ""Do you think this is done?"" she asks him.  He doesn't know.
Lost in Translation is the story of Charlotte waiting to grow up, and finding someone to wait with her.
Bob is an American movie star doing an ad campaign for Suntory whiskey in Tokyo.  His marriage is rocky, but he doesn't want it to end.  Bob and Charlotte meet.  They each recognize a soul mate.  But they also know from the beginning that it can't last.  Neither one wants to take advantage of the other.
The comedy in the film comes from Bob's interaction with Japanese culture (sometimes verging on clich).  The drama comes from Charlotte and Bob's desire for each other, along with the knowledge that, regardless of what happens in their marriages, they're not the ones for each other.
Bill Murray as Bob deserves the Oscar for showing all this with his weary face.  Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte displays not just grown-up emotions, but the act of growing up as we watch.
Tokyo, filmed mostly at night, seems like most big cities to be itself more than part of the country it belongs to.  We see the contrast when Charlotte comes across a traditional Japanese wedding outside the city, though you wonder if there's a reality for the Japanese somewhere between hypermodern Tokyo and re-creations of ancient religious ceremonies.
Charlotte and Bob spend their nights together, fighting insomnia, running from one club or party to another.  The Japanese they talk to are mostly young, struggling to be understood in basic English and even French, in contrast with businessmen Bob overhears in the hotel sauna comfortably speaking German between themselves, but not experiencing anything of Tokyo.  (I think they were complaining there was no German food.)  The music is American and British.  Karaoke is everywhere - - even the American lounge singer in the hotel is more of a karaoke singer than a New York chanteuse.
When they have to leave each other, Bob goes home to his family, while Charlotte walks into the Tokyo crowds, alone but confident.  It's finally daytime.",1075939200,14,3081,4.8865384615384615

There's no morphing, there's no getting pounded over the head with the music, and sound effects don't swirl around you while you watch it.  However, if you're a fan of the French New Wave (look it up if you don't know), you'll recognize that Sofia Coppola has made a lovely valentine, not only to her star, Bill Murray, but to a style of groundbreaking film that seems quaint by today's corporate-sponsored monolith standards.  Other reviewers have outlined the story - or supposed lack thereof - so I won't get into that.  But anyone who tells you nothing is happening in this film is approaching it the wrong way.  Maybe it's best to simply quote the brilliant jazz pianist, Bill Evans, and leave it at that:  ""Some people just want to be hit over the head and, if they get hit hard enough, maybe they'll feel something. But some people want to get inside of something and discover more richness. And I think it will always be the same; they're not going to be the great percentage of the people. A great percentage of the people don't want a challenge. They want something to be done to them -- they don't want to participate. But there'll always be maybe 15% that desire something more, and they'll search it out.  And maybe that's where art is.""",1075939200,5,1352,4.5850622406639
1509294,5,B00005JMJ4,"I would think that this sort of film would play better on a large screen in a darkened theatre, where the viewer is actually immersed in the images---the flicker of the neon, the passage of the overhead trains---and simultaneously senses that feeling of being lost in the largeness of a cityscape inhabited by so many bodies without any point of reference.  Although, the film takes advantage of the two leads' feelings of disassociation with regard to a seemingly foreign environment, the feeling evoked here by director Sofia Coppala is one all of us has sadly experienced one time or another.

Indeed, it is this feeling that drives the small plot: a 50+ actor being paid millions to endorse a Scotch to the Japanese public ponders his aloneness and the meaninglessness of his existence during a whirl of publicity shots, advertizing takes and sojourns to the hotel bar.  At the same time, a 25 year old wife accompanies her photographer husband and stays at the same hotel where she contemplates being stuck in the irrevalent aftermath of someone else's existence. The two characters, both lost and unable to translate what they see around them into any meaningful frame of reference for themselves, turn towards each other, finding solace in their ability to see that they are at the same point of self-discovery within their own lives.

Moody and dreary at times, despite the lack of action, the movie does convey that sense of being lost in a world that moves pretty much at light-speed momentum.  Tokyo may stand as the backdrop, but I think Coppola focuses on the world of hype and media in general-a world that conjurs up a pace of its own where human components are mere adjuncts rather than the driving force.  The two main characters question the relevance of such a world and revel in their discovery that together they find, at least for a moment, some translation relevant to their lives which actually causes emotion rather than simply sensation.

I certainly do not recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a plot driven movie and who is not willing to sit out the long silences.  Rather than prose, this piece is a poem--a haiku, if you will.  Its message is simple, stark and bleak and the viewer must be willing to enter that sense of nothingness and accept it on its own terms.  Rather this film is recommended to those who want to ponder and think upon the small worlds we create to anchor us in a world pretty much out of control.",1075852800,3,2462,4.717948717948718

""Lost in Translation"" plays out this scenario by building on subtle tensions.  An early sequence of scenes builds up several relationship slaps between Charlotte and her husband of two years.  For example, he forgets to introduce her to a bouncy blonde old friend he runs into in the hotel lobby.  With her husband constantly away on a rock-band photo shoot, Charlotte is established as unhappily married and lonely in Tokyo.  Bob Harris is established as lonely in Tokyo as he goes through the semi-humiliation of being a famous American in Japan.  He finds himself in comic situations best illustrated by the scene where a complimentary prostitute comes to his room and wants him to ""lip""-or was it ""rip""-her stockings.  When Harris gets a note that he forgot his son's birthday, his sleepless nights and dedication to his seat at the hotel bar are colored by problems in a 25 year marriage.
When Bob and Charlotte meet, the movie takes on the feel of a summer vacation romance between the unhappily married.  As the young Charlotte asks Bob questions about life and displays quiet, girlish admiration for Bob's witty comments, a new dimension of tension develops as we wonder if this is the development of romantic love or father/daughter love.
This is a slow, moody movie that can only keep the viewer interested through subtle tensions set against a back-drop that shows interesting, comic, beautiful, and weird perspectives on Tokyo culture.",1075852800,,1685,5.127737226277373
1509437,5,B00005JMJ4,"Some films overwhelm the senses with audio and visual effects in an overzealous attempt to capture the audience's attention.  Lost in Translation will not challenge your surround sound system, or dazzle you with colors.  It is simple in plot and direction.  And it is in its simplicity where writer/director Sofia Coppola creates brilliance.
The story, put simply, is about the feeling of being lost in a crowd.  A middle aged American movie star in Tokyo to promote a Japanese whiskey (played by Bill Murray) meets a stunning twentysomething woman (Scarlett Johansson)who's in town to accompany her workaholic husband (Giovanni Ribisi) on a photo assignment.  They both are insomniacs who are unhappy with their marriages and unsure of their purposes in life.  Night after night they find solace in one another's company not for sex, but for companionship.  There is a sexual tension between the two, of course, but it's repression adds to the characters' bond.
The subtext to the story surrounding Scarlett Johansson's character, Charlotte, is particularly intriguing because Coppola has hinted that it is autobiogaphical.  Immediately you will notice that Charlotte looks/acts/speaks like Sofia Coppola.  Her young photographer husband, Johnny, looks/acts/speaks like Spike Jonze- Coppola's real life X-husband.  So upon realizing that these characters are based in fact, the appearance of a Cameron Diaz look-alike (I mean, it's scary how similar this actress is in voice and mannerisms to Diaz) as an actress to whom- it is hinted- Johnny had an affair with, makes for a very naked declaration on Coppola's part...
note:  for those of you who may not know, Spike Jonze directed Cameron Diaz in his debut film Being John Malkovich.  It is rumored that an affair between the two resulted in Jonze and Coppola's breakup...
Not to be forgotten is the acting in this film.  Scarlet Johansson is on her way to becoming a major star, and her performance is Oscar worthy.  Bill Murray has been an underrated actor for the entire span of his career and this film may be the role that finally gets him the credit that's long overdue.",1075852800,,2128,5.11271676300578

To these eyes and ears this mimicking of English pronunciation and the concept that nearly all Japanese people are ignorant of English in the hotels and the media creates an insulting view.  As for the performances Murray and Johansson make the best of what little they have to work with and FINALLY in the last 20 minutes we begin to care about them as people.  Not a bad movie, just one that has been over-rated.  Do yourself a favor when viewing this DVD: turn the volume down to escape the deafening music and the bad Karaoke!",1075852800,4,1152,4.590243902439024
1509439,3,B00005JMJ4,"In any other year, this movie would be a forgettable throwaway. It is a cheap ""star-vehicle"" for Scarlett Johanssen with a cookie-cutter script and a little-known woman director, strictly bottom-rung fodder in the Hollywood system. What then explains its strange popularity among the reviewers? It could be an utter lack of competition in the other offerings this year. But beyond that, the movie has a unique, unpredictable chemistry that strikes viewers as more sincere, simple and authentic than many big-budget crowd pleasers. Most significant is the rare maturity of Bill Murray's character for a modern movie, and his trademark understated performance. His character refuses to bed the vulnerable and lonely Johanssen, though he proves he is not above this with someone he respects much less. His advice on marriage is so viscerally realistic, it is almost cinema verite.
Understated acting is not the word - one feels the real Mr. Murray is speaking from the depth of his life's experience rather than an actor from a script. In the end, this is not acting so much as Bill Murray's own very contradictory character  - a performer who refuses to pretend. In all his movies, he seems to barely have the energy for the act, and rather clowns around with a barely concealed contempt for what he is doing. Sometimes this is disappointing and hard to watch, but in a vehicle which is not desperately trying to aim high, it can achieve unexpected wonders. The scene in the restaurant is another high moment. After being caught with another woman, Murray's character doesn't hide his eyes in shame, nor attack Johanssen cruelly. He looks right into her eyes, leaning back against the wall with a seemingly irreproachable depth of experience and exhaustion behind him and makes no excuses or apologies. Again, in this otherwise insignificant and inconsequential vehicle, this utter lack of pretension is gripping.
The movie I can most compare this to is ""My Cousin Vinnie"", another throwaway star-vehicle for Marisa Tomei with Joe Pesci as the established older actor lending her his reputation and economic drawing-power. But again, that movie was a surprise popular hit. The storyline was so poor that the actors could only rise above it by assuming an air of derision, and it was precisely this which ironically gave the movie its feeling of chemistry, groundedness and authenticity.
Many Hollywood vehicles try desperately to imitate a successful formula for authenticity. Real art is that work which does not imitate, but achieves the real thing. Therefore, we must also perhaps credit the casting and Sophia Coppola's direction with understated grace, perception of the chemistry of her actors, and that all-too-rare Hollywood sixth-sense for the authentic.
But ultimately, I have to agree with the other reviewers - a popular hit, maybe, but otherwise pretty overrated.",1075852800,3,2874,5.167381974248927
1509440,1,B00005JMJ4,"I am a fan of indie films, so I'm not just biased against the genre.  I really do think this film is boring and stupid!  The concept is wonderful, the acting is as it should be, the chemistry is there, the setting is atmospheric - and director Sofia Coppola, like some kind of indie George Lucas, takes great material and just pulverizes it!!!  I don't care whose daughter she is, she is just proving that the only thing worse than her acting is her directing!  I guess film talent ISN'T hereditary!
OK, now that I've gotten the ugliness out of me, I'll try to stay objective.  I really wanted to like this movie - I like the actors, and the idea of a platonic love developing between two displaced Americans was a wonderful concept to me!  I just wish the film had spent more time developing that instead of the lingering shots of Scarlett sitting at the window, or Bill sitting at the bar just looking bored.  I wish there were less lingering shots of Scarlett walking down this street and then that street and then sitting on a bus, then at a cafe, then in the bath-tub!  Any half-competent director can establish in about three or four shots that these characters are lonely and depressed!
What I wanted more of was actual connecting dialogue, some hint of character development.  Instead, once the two FINALLY meet after about thirty minutes, you get a quip from Bill, a laugh from Scarlett, then a ""see ya round,""  Shampoo, rinse, repeat for about 70 minutes . . . annnnd scene!  So what happens in the end?  Are they in love?  Are they going to see each other again?  Has anything about them changed?  No, all we have is a movie that succeeds in only ONE thing - making the viewer feel as bored as the characters.
I for one am sick and tired of independent films like this one getting praised up and down when there are so many good ones out there that are much more worth a watch!  Want a good indie night?  Go rent THE DAYTRIPPERS, CLOCKWATCHERS, and MEMENTO for starters!  And, for a MUCH, MUCH better look at the amazing Scarlett Johanson, check out GHOST WORLD, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, and GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING - GHOST WORLD even has some nice jabs at just this type of overblown, art-house filmmaking!  Give this one a pass - don't let the critics make you feel less cultured and stupid just because you expect a plot and a story progression for your money!
Best Picture?!?  God forbid!
One last thing - the marketers, realizing how boring this movie is as a drama, thought it would be more effective to sell it to the unsuspecting public as a comedy!  WRONG AGAIN!  There is nothing funny in this movie beyond some wry and ironic moments that, frankly, thrive only on racial ignorance of Japanese culture and their inabilities to pronounce ""L's and R's"" properly - yep, the humor is THAT sophisticated!!  I thought we were a living in a more culturally advanced society - but if I were Japanese, I would have been offended at the portrayal.",1075852800,26,2961,4.483208955223881
1509441,4,B00005JMJ4,"I am a japanese who has spent a great deal of time in both japanese and american cultures so when I heard of this film I couldn't wait for the movie to come out in Tokyo (sometime in 2004),and therefore bought the dvd.  The film started out great but the excitement gradually faded and became a bit boring. To me there were too many scenes in the hotel that built up on the  lonliness that just became too depressing. To the foreign eye, all of the scenes of Japan must've looked mysterious and beautiful. I think the cinematography was great and there were many beautiful scenes, but it seemed so fragmented. It's like okay here we have a scene in a buddist temple, next we have a scene of a wedding couple in kimonos in Kyoto, next... being japanese these scenes to me were like post card images and didn't really contribute to the plot of the movie. I'd imagine they had to do alot of guerilla filming around Tokyo because it's not easy getting permits to shoot large productions in public areas here. I appreciated the kind of relationship Bob and Charlotte had where they couldn't (or he couldn't) cross the line to become more than great friends, however I think the developement of the intimacy between the two suffered because alot of the time was devoted to trying to show the japanese culture. Don't get me wrong, this film probably had the most accurate coverage of what life in this city looks like (except for the lap dancing joint which looked alot more like someone's imagination).  Great film in terms of cinematography, music, tension, and bringing out the exotic feel of Japan,  but I think it may be a bit overrated as for being nominated for best Oscar picture.",1075852800,5,1681,4.574750830564784

By the end of the movie I found myself comfortably surprised, delighted at the quiet story of two lost souls who find themselves in a place that feels altogether alien. Even in the most quiet of moments, when the camera seems to linger on a scene longer than you might expect, I felt the weight of the loneliness these two characters find themselves within. It resonated in a way that only handful of films ever have or will... which in itself is the mark of a truly great film. From Bill Murry and Scarlett Johansson's profound characterization to Sofia Coppla's visionary style this is definitely one of the must-see films of 2003.",1075852800,2,765,4.591240875912408

It didn't matter. Boring characters, boring script, boring movie!!! I can't believe it was nominated for best picture while good films were passed over. I can't see how anyone can call this a great movie, unless understated and boring is now considered greatness.

1509519,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is a wonderful movie of two lost souls who for a short time seem to find each other and themselves...and then they move on. An unhurried, gentle and delicate reflection of searching for meaning and direction. It reminded me of ""Un Coeur En Hiver (A Heart in Winter)"", this is unfortunately only available in VHS.
The plot is simple: take two thoughtful, intelligent but conflicted  souls out of their usual environment (place them in the familiar, but distinctly different city scape of Tokyo), take away their communication channels (leave only fax messages, cell-phone calls, poor translation attempts), their daily rhythm (resulting in a dazed insomnia) and have them discover what really matters the most to them.
Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an actor, who sold his soul and talent for a 2 million dollar advertisement offer, while he could be in a play back at home. He is married with children. He is cynical, but never condescending.
Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is way after the honeymoon of her 2 year marriage, with the doubts of a seemingly wasted Yale philosophy degree, who spends a lot of time staring through her hotel window or walking around in an impersonal city. She is gentle, but never sentimental.
During a few days in Tokyo they discover that what both of them were missing was intimacy and mutually stimulating companionship blended through the magical charm of romance.",1075766400,,1400,5.008583690987124
1509520,5,B00005JMJ4,"Amidst all of the big Hollywood blockbusters late last year, there premiered a small, quiet little film that nearly blew all other films out of the water. Now, as Oscar season rolls around, there seems to be great emphasis on this film and deservedly so. ""Lost in Translation"" was one of the best films released last year, and quite possibly, over the course of several years.
The plot initially seems bland or blase; a washed-up movie star visits Tokyo to do a liquor commercial, and meets an attractive girl in a bar. So what makes this film so special?
First, the talent of Bill Murray.  Murray simply steals this movie and makes it his own. As Bill Harris, Murray drips sadness, bewilderment, and approachibility with every scene. He somehow drops his comic guard and allows us in, living with him this incredible foreign experience. We are with him every step of the way, and understand him totally. Adding to the mixture is the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, who mirrors Murray's performance perfectly. The two leads could not have been better suited for these roles.
Second, the script rocks. Both characters at different times in their lives ooze a loneliness that's brought out in the hustle and bustle of modern day Japan. They reach out to each other in thier loneliness, in an attempt to make human contact with another like soul. Although both characters are married, it's never threatening, and you come to understand their motives. All of this is emphasized with the second theme running through the movie, a fish out of water in the country of Japan. The results are both hilarious and introspective, and perfect.
But what really makes this movie shine is the many, many, many moments of perfect quietness that speak essential truths. The lonely sound of bells ringing as Murray stands heads above each person in the elevator. The underwater exercise class. Charlotte walking across the pond on circular stones. Bill sitting alone in the bar. Charlotte being pulled into a flower arranging class. You may appreciate one or two of these moments, but this film is loaded with them. They allow this film to breathe; breathe life into the plot, the characters, and breathe life into ourselves.
Lost in Translation is a remarkable film from a remarkable first time director. If you haven't seen it, rent or buy in now. You simple won't regret this decision.",1075766400,2,2367,4.888059701492537
1509521,5,B00005JMJ4,"This movie was such a good movie, i wrote about it for a college class last semester. Here are some excerpts from my paper.
""Lost in Translation is a movie not intended for the masses. It does not have 15 minute car chases, or handsome Hollywood hunks.  It has real characters, with real problems that find themselves in a strange place. Lost in Translation captures a feeling lost in many movies today, loneliness. Movies should not always have a story book ending, because that is not the way life really is.  Loneliness is a constant theme throughout this movie, but it is expressed in many different ways.""
""When Bob calls home, it is as cordial as a conversation with a telemarketer. He will say ""I love you"" after his wife hangs up. It appears as if the love is gone in his relationship with his wife. He seems very depressed. He drowns his pain in an ever-present glass of whiskey.""
""Movies are meant to give you an escape from reality. Sometimes a good bloody movie is just the cure for a bland week at school. This movie is not an escape from reality. The only escape is into the glowing lights of Tokyo.  This movie probably plays out for people everyday.  It somehow finds a way to be entertaining. It is defiantly not a movie for the masses. Some people would find it very difficult to sit through this movie. This is real life though, and it is interesting. The feelings this movie will give you are indescribable. You will feel for Bob when he is on the phone with his wife. You will feel for Charlotte when she realizes she faces a daunting task in front of her, staying married. Your emotions will be tugged upon during the ending. These characters both are lonely without each other. Millions of questions go unanswered in this movie, but that is what makes it so good. It is not the classic happy ending. If a happy ending is what you want, Go see Finding Nemo. For a great movie, with great actors and a great story, check out Lost in Translation. It is a movie that deals with very real problems we face everyday. Loneliness is present in everyone's life. This movie breaks the mold of Hollywood movies. Lost in Translation is a movie about life. Life is not perfect but it is still worth living""",1075766400,,2216,4.477722772277228

This disc is terrible:

1. Universal's decision to bundle ten minutes of ads at the beginning, which cannot be skipped, is classless and grubbing.

2. The mastering is poor -- compression artifacts are evident in dark scenes, and the overall image feels slightly blurred.

3. The audio is poorly mastered, too, abruptly changing levels several times. Did anyone even supervise this transfer?

4. An insert of some kind would have been nice, even just a photo card. Opening the sleeve to just the disc is a mild letdown, and left me wondering if only my copy is like this.

It's a shame a movie this enjoyable was pushed through such a shoddy production process. Let's hope another distributor gets their hands on this soon and does it right.",1075766400,97,886,4.758169934640523

A lot has been said about BM acting in this, but the directing by Sofia Coppola is brilliant, and I think she has a very good future.  The lenses used and the position of the camera really make for the emotion of the actors to come through.  The blurry backgrounds, neon lights... all good stuff for a movie that needs to have elements to prop up a totally emotional film.
All in all, if you are expecting a howl of laughter from Bill Murray, you won't get one here.. you will giggle from time to time because of BM's affable character that he brings to life in every scene that he is in (especially the commericial out takes) but you will find an actor that is really fun to watch and enjoy in this movie.

Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson did a very nice job, but as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, I didn't feel that there was any chemistry between them.  And the movie is supposed to be about a connection between foreigners, so without that element, it loses a lot of authenticity.
I also spent most of the movie trying to decide whether there was supposed to be a sexual tension between the characters and I couldn't decide.  While a certain amount of ambiguity is interesting, a ""just friends"" vibe that suddenly gets blown away by a passionate kiss at the end just seems like Ms. Coppola couldn't decide what she was trying to go for.
Speaking of, the direction wasn't great.  The movie felt overly long, primarily because the pacing was terrible.  It often felt like the characters were thrown into situations, just for the shock value or an intended mood.

1509689,5,B00005JMJ4,"So often films are superfluous, just a piece of entertainment - fine for the normal movie-goer, but dull for the real film enthusiast. This film is not like that. Sofia Copolla tenderly builds the characters in this movie by allowing the audience to really watch them, not by steering the audience around a flashy, effects-laden script, giving brief glimpses of the characters at the `normal' 30 shots per minute, but by actually giving us time to get to know the characters.
There are a multitude of shots that are there just to show you the loneliness and isolation of the situation and a lot of times the camera just waits around showing the characters lying down, not doing anything, the length of these shots feel almost voyeuristic, but that, I suppose, is the intention. The characters are not just players helping the story along, but they actually *ARE the story* It feels almost trite to say so, but the film really is about the emotions of these characters rather than the actual things that happen to them.
In most films the actors play a role and they are paid to make us believe that they are the characters they are portraying. Congratulations to them when they do it, it tends to be a good movie. But I can honestly say that there are few movies that actually make you really *care* about the characters, that is a mark of a truly GREAT film. This is one of those few. It wasn't long into watching the film that I realised that I was feeling a bit of their loneliness, but halfway through I felt almost helpless. I felt as if I was a bad friend to them, that they needed someone to show them that people cared for them, just a hug would have helped, but I couldn't give that to them. That is the intensity with which the film carries on, we want them to find each other and to know that they are not alone even in this alien land.
I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but suffice it to say that as we care for the characters (both are married, although not very happily) we know that they shouldn't have an affair and that what would be best for them is just to have someone to share the loneliness with. We see their relationships with their spouses in fleeting glimpses, but this is because this is all *they* see of them. Their partners' only real crimes are neglect, but in the situation Charlotte and Bob now find themselves in, this is one of the worst things that could happen.
In some ways I could talk about the film for hours (far beyond the 1000 word limit for reviews anyway!), about the shot framing, the texture and colour of the film lending itself to the subdued experiences they face and about the natural (yet at times hilarious and very intelligent) dialogue; but really the only justice I can do this film is by WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMENDING IT!
You really would be missing out by not seeing this film. It is cinema as an art-form, not just as flashy entertainment. But if you are into Big-Budget Blockbusters then you may not appreciate the subtleties of the performances or the lingering character-shots. It is not really for entertainment, it is an experience. Go, watch it and be touched by it, but be warned, this is a very affecting film about loneliness and solitude and you may not want to see it if you are not ready to share those emotions with the characters for a few hours, I also wouldn't recommend seeing it alone!
That said, this is one of the most powerful films I have seen and as such is definitely one of my favourite films. Make every effort to see this now!",1075766400,,3524,4.448222565687789

She exhibits the superficial and ridiculous sides of Japan, but she does it with all her hearth and with deep respect.

1509691,5,B00005JMJ4,"There are many ways to look at this bouquet of a film.  There is the city of Tokyo in its shiny, immeasurable brilliance.  There is the advent of a star being born, Scarlett Johansson.  There is the loopy, loose script that--while imperfect--hardly impedes on the breathtaking, panoramic view of the Japanese capital and the two tiny foreigners who run around in it.
But most of all there is Bill Murray, smoldering and chuckling in what must be the pinnacle of his far-too-long-overlooked career.  One of the strengths (counterintuitively) of this film is that there's too little of him on screen.  We wonder about this fascinating character Murray creates, wanting to dig deeper, to understand more and better.  And yet the film resists, cleverly leaving Murray's washed-up-but-still-crackling fading movie star as one of the most enigmatic screen personages to come out of Hollywood in the last quarter-century.
A sequel might well be a travesty (you'll understand once you see the film), but audiences worldwide would certainly cheer for another slice of this compelling if relunctant character.",1075680000,,1099,5.251428571428572

They find something in one another that once existed in their lives, but seems to have deflated.  And the unfortunate thing is that even though they have their moments, they can only last so long.  Reality will come creeping up, but the memory, however, will linger on forever.  A complete exercise in non-verbal communication, Lost In Translation is akin to those films that leave you wanting more, but satisfaction is attained through the memory of the good times and replay.",1075680000,,652,4.837837837837838
1509693,4,B00005JMJ4,"I'll start off with a metaphor. If other movies are like diving in the pool, then Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is like floating on your back and staring up at the sun. It's a movie that doesn't try to impress or even engage the viewer. It exists on its own lifeline, and if you're willing to tag along, you'll be rewarded with an engrossing and endearing experience. Notice I said ""experience"", because that's what the movie is. There are no heavy plotlines, there is not a lot of dialogue. There only exists two central characters who are lonely and isolated in a foreign country falling in love. There is no hidden message behind the lush visuals and beautiful performances by the actors. There is no knee slapping hilarity or tear jerking sad moments, there is only rich and heavy emotion...the kind of emotion that you aren't sure exactly what you're feeling.
Bill Murray stars as Bob Harris, a washed up actor who has been hired to endorse a Japanese whiskey company. Arriving in Tokyo to shoot some commercials, he is tired....of his job, of his life, and everyone around him. As fate would have it, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and her photographer husband are staying in the same hotel. Charlotte is a recent Yale graduate who is dissatisfied with her marriage and her direction in life. Meeting in the hotel bar, Bob and Charlotte slowly and gently fall in love, coming to terms with their own unhappiness with their lives.
Sofia Coppola would've been a great music video director. And this time (maybe the only time), I mean that as a compliment. The visuals focus in and out of eachother, slowly panning over the amazing Japanese landscapes, both in the city and the country side. Throughout a large portion of the movie, there is virtually no dialogue. Yet you're still captivated by the way Coppola takes you from scene to scene, most notably in the beginning as Charlotte wanders her way through Tokyo into the more rural landscapes. These scenes say something about Charlotte's character, both wide eyed and aware, noticing and all encompassing, and most of all....appreciative. It builds up a kind of sympathy from the viewer on Charlotte being married to her callous and rude husband, John. Yet Coppola shows her skill in being able to switch gears quickly, as Bob's storyline involves a lot more subtle and hilarious humor, mostly from Bill Murray. We should make a note that Murray could've easily botched this role (or been the sole bad mark on the whole movie). But give him credit for never even approaching the edge of comedic shtick. He remains sad and desperate, a man whose job is to be other people that he doesn't even remember who he is. For probably one of the first times in his career, the humor comes from the movie, and not from him.
I want to say one thing. Even without LOTR running against them, I doubt Lost in Translation would've even been given a second glance for Best Picture. It's just not that kind of movie. And once again, I have to stress how much credit Sofia Coppola should be given for not making it one of ""those kind of movies"", because she could have easily turned the star power and the fresh plot idea into a glitzy and heavier movie. But she keeps it gentle and subtle, which is obviously not for everyone. In fact, I heard the guy next to me completely doze off while watching it. And I could completely understand why. The movie is slow, it's deliberately slow. It's uninvolving, it's quiet, it's not a heart stopper in the least. But that's why it's so good.
It's virtually impossible to explain much more about the movie. If you haven't already seen it, you may just wait til Tuesday and see the DVD. But I strongly suggest to you that you see it in the theaters before it's gone from it's post-nomination run....seeing it in the theater makes it more enveloping. It's thick and dense and fills the room, and you may find yourself gently smiling to yourself in parts where absolutely nothing is happening.
I will leave you with this....another metaphor if you will. Lost in Translation is like the girl you're in love with, when she takes her hand and brushes your face. No kiss, no sex, nothing else. Just a small, simple touch. If you're a person who can find infinite happiness in an act like that, go run to see this movie. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, look for your money shot in any of the other movies out now. Along Came Polly maybe...

1509811,2,B00005JMJ4,"LIT certainly has its moments. Many of those moments are wordless, musical, dreamy, observant, and scarce. As a friend I won't reveal any of them to you. Just know that the film isn't the most interesting character study. The movie is about two American strangers who meet each other in Tokyo and find solace in their ability to communicate with each other, verbally, emotionally, and psychologically. To their chagrin, nearly all of the citizens they bump into are either incapable of speaking English, or incapable of recognizing the fact that these American looking folks do not speak their language.
But the two strangers are not the only Americans here. Theres a female lounge singer, a couple of male bar frequenters, a young female Hollywood star, a Hip-Hop producer, and at the last minute, a tall, blonde, 30 or 40 something beauty, who is a fan of the main male character, Bob, a middle aged actor played by Bill Murray. But those characters are all undeveloped and secondary, including their spouses. Why, I wonder, did she create these characters in the first place? Especially the husband/photographer of Charlotte, a Yale graduate and Philosophy major, played by Scarlet Johansson. The guy only has a few scenes to speak of, and when hes on screen, hes consistently unaffectionate towards his effortlessly beautiful  wife. This is the part of the movie where the audience joins Coppola in a collective Huh? as we try to fathom what it is this fool does not see in this walking masterpiece (during their first couple of scenes together, Scarlet walks around in her panties= Good stuff, good stuff!). We learn nothing about him, except that hes a photographer and is constantly on call. Clearly Sofia Coppola, the writer/director of the film, could have found a way to throw Charlotte into the arms of Bob without this character existing. Either that, or she could have developed him more. It is possible to create a character we love to hate, right? In regards to Bob, we never see his wife, but we do hear her whenever he calls her on the phone.
Her voice doesnt rise when she says Bob. Instead, it falls and crashes like a broken jaw. Apparently, their bed is cold. Apparently, if Bob and Charlotte were to be caught together, by any one of their spouses, the both of them might blow a collective sigh of relief, or say to themselves: Thank God, I didn't have to break it to her/him.
Because Coppola wanted to tell a love story, Bob doesnt meet his old buddy (or buddies) from college. He doesnt even meet a beautiful, intelligent Asian woman who speaks the language, or an Asian guy who speaks English. Instead, he meets a young American girl (shockingly, Scarlet, the actress, is only 18). For those of you who find the older man/younger woman relationship thing creepy and gross, you more or less need not worry your little head. If not for the films unnecessary and brief venture into a strip club ( did I just put the words unnecessary and strip club into the same sentence?), the movie would have most likely received a PG-13, or a PG. According to the Motion Picture Association of America, the movie received the R-rating because of brief sexual content (i.e. the brief trip into the strip club).
But as a romance, LIT lacks a very important component: chemistry between its two actors. Except for the final scenes, Bill Murrays performance comes across as disaffected as when we first met him. Sure, he smiles at Scarlet on cue, but what self-respecting heterosexual man wouldnt be capable of smiling at her lovely face, or body? Unfortunately, Scarlet Johansson, who mostly acts natural despite the limitations of her character, isn't given much to do as an actress. Her character is looking for attention and for the meaning of life. During the later scenes, shes quiet and observant. During the earlier scenes, we sense that she is internally bitching about the fact that her husband is inattentive. But she says nothing outright. As an actor, what can she do there, especially when the directors camera is busy messaging her legs, or staring out of a window, which has a spectacular view of the city? (The last bit is done too often and to little effect, sadly)
So, weve got a romance without chemistry, and a character study without interesting characters. What, you ask, are the films redeeming qualities? Why did I give it two stars instead of one?
Well, as I said before, it is because of a few transcendent, music video like moments, which I care not to mention  in case you're still interested in seeing this.

Ive almost neglected to mention the fact that LIT is also a lame fish-out water story. Often, Bill is forced to make clueless facial expressions because he doesnt understand the language, or the customs, or why the bathroom showerhead is low enough to water everything below his bellybutton. Theres also a seriously unfunny scene involving the line, Lip my stocking.

Not that itll make any difference, but Sofia Coppola could have made a damn fine documentary on neon-lit Tokyo? She could have scored it to the sounds of My Bloody Valentine, as well as every other band out their with a dreamy rock aesthetic. For an idea as to what Im talking about, check out her video for Kevin Shields City Girl. It mostly focuses on Charlotte acting like a tourist.",1075593600,,5299,4.781659388646288
1509812,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in translation is a very different and refreshing piece of work, when compared with all the other mainstream movies around at the moment.
Bill Murray as the middle age crisis star Bob Harris had given up a career building play to star in an ad in which he has no idea what he was supposed to do. Even worse, his stay in the jetlagged Tokyo was lengthened out of business consideration and now he had to face  more lonely sleepless nights.
Similarly a university graduate wife of a photographer on business trip in Tokyo was having the same problem. She was having the ""expatriate wife syndrome"" that apart from insomnia, she felt lonely and helpless. She attempted to cure this infinite loneliness by going around the city to look for interesting stuff to do. However, to her surprise, what interested her was another lonely man in the bar of the same hotel.
Their encounter sparked off a very interesting relationship and friendship between the pair. They do stuff together, trying new healthy Jap food of which some required them to cook by themselves (a shock for them). The cultural shock was blended into the support that they have for each other in this alien city that they don't want to be in.
Lost in Tranlsation deals with the topic of unwillingness, cultural shock and mutual support. Who would foresee a Yale graduate wife of a photographer will develop an interesting friendship with a megastar in his mid-age crisis? The topic was dealt with with delicate care and tenderness mixed with a slim sense of saddness. The director managed to balance all these aspects tactfully. From how she tried to show the audience with how Tokyo life looks like in the 2 hours, we can see that it was well researched as the movie didn't show stereotypical Japanese culture only. The movie gave the Japanese culture a very fair portrayal which is very well done for an American movie.
The actors are brilliant. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson gave an excellent performance for the two characters. Bill as an experienced actor in and alien culture doing things he had been doing all his life, but still had no idea how to do it was just fabulous. Scarlett Johansson as a wife longing for care and love in an alien city was also very well done. Her struggle against loneliness by site seeing and hanging out with this mid-age actor was well crafted.
The movie portrayed some of the beautiful sceneries from Tokyo and Kyoto and the cinematography is very well done. It is not a typical mainstream movie type of story that you would expect but it does give you a feeling of difference. The gags are very well done and keep the movie interesting. Nonetheless, there are certain parts of the movie that pace slowed down immensely, this could lose a bit of audience attention.

But there is a reason for this.  Having been to Japan 4 times I totally knew how the main characters felt.
This was a brilliant movie, but the watcher needs to be warned that if you have not been to Japan you might not fully see why the film has gotten all the rave reviews that it has.
My favorite scene which has happened to me so many times is when Bill Murray in the in elevator and looks around and notices how different he looks from all the Japanese, how out of place he feels.  Anyone who has travelled to Asia has felt this moment.

1509817,5,B00005JMJ4,"There are many ways to look at this bouquet of a film. There is the city of Tokyo in its shiny, immeasurable brilliance. There is the advent of a star being born, Scarlett Johansson. There is the loopy, loose script that--while imperfect--hardly impedes on the breathtaking, panoramic view of the Japanese capital and the two tiny foreigners who run around in it.
But most of all there is Bill Murray, smoldering and chuckling in what must be the pinnacle of his far-too-long-overlooked career. One of the strengths (counterintuitively) of this film is that there's too little of him on screen. We wonder about this fascinating character Murray creates, wanting to dig deeper, to understand more and better. And yet the film resists, cleverly leaving Murray's washed-up-but-still-crackling fading movie star as one of the most enigmatic screen personages to come out of Hollywood in the last quarter-century.
A sequel might well be a travesty (you'll understand once you see the film), but audiences worldwide would certainly cheer for another slice of this compelling if relunctant character.",1075334400,,1093,5.251428571428572
1509818,5,B00005JMJ4,"As I began to compose this brief commentary, I remembered that Sofia Coppola was cast as the infant being baptized during the final sequence of events in the first Godfather film (1972) which her father directed. She later appeared in Godfather Part III, a last minute and miscast substitute, reputedly for Winona Ryder. How different this film is from those films as well as The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now/Redux (1979) which her father also directed.
With regard to Lost in Translation, she wrote the screenplay as well as directed it, evoking brilliant performances from Bill Murray (as Bob Harris) and Scarlett Johansson (as Charlotte). For me, the title suggests multiple dimensions of irony. Some are obviously related to Harris, familiar to those in Tokyo who recognize him but certainly adrift (if not totally lost) in a culture foreign to him in almost every possible way. Other ironies involve communication difficulties unrelated to fluency in language. For example, even after two years of marriage, Charlotte and John (Giovanni Ribisi) are -- to a significant extent -- strangers to each other as are Bob and his wife back in the United States to whom he has been married for quite some time. Moreover, much of the communication between Charlotte and Bob is also lost in translation,  more the result (I think) of generational than linguistic differences. All this suggests an important point to me: It is difficult (if not impossible) for others to know who you are if you don't. It is also so important, moreover, to know who you aren't. Presumably Bob has been struggling with these issues, at least since his career began to evaporate. Both Bob and Charlotte are at or near a crossroad in their respective lives when they first meet. After several days together, their relationship arrives at another crossroad. Which way to go? Where is his life headed? And hers? Will they proceed together?
Here are two of several reasons why I admire this film so much. First, thanks to Coppola and her superb cast, it has exceptional charm. There are so many targets of opportunity for a cynical statement. However, to her great credit, she ignores them all. Although there are highly amusing (sometimes zany) moments along the way, to be sure, Coppola develops the characters of Bob and Charlotte with respect and affection but never with condescension. The second reason is that this film has great natural energy which Coppola juxtaposes with moments of intimacy, tenderness, reflection, and even poignancy. To achieve that, Coppola and Lance Acord blend as well as balance exterior shots of Tokyo at night (which resembles Las Vegas) with exterior shots of religious shrines during the day, thereby complementing Charlotte and Bob's diverse moods as they explore at least some of the country in which they feel lost.
Given what she achieves in this film, I am eager to see how Coppola's career develops in years to come. My hunch (only a hunch) is that her talents are more diverse than those of her father (e.g. slapstick comedy) and thus the nature and extent of opportunities which await her are greater than those available to him after the first Godfather film (1972). He must be a very proud father....and should be.
FYI: The special features of the DVD version include a conversation with Coppola and Murray, a behind-the-scenes featurette which includes exclusive footage shot by the filmmakers (""Lost on Location""), several deleted scenes, and an extended version of the Japanese TV show, ""Matthew's Best Hit TV.""",1075334400,,3542,5.034071550255536

1509899,5,B00005JMJ4,"Largely a plotless story of time, place, impression and acquaintance, a strong mood is built of subtle images, a stellar and fitting soundtrack and superb cast. Sofia Coppola has created a film which is visually appealing, bringing to life the overwhelming nature of Tokyo as well as the stark contrast of cultures (culture shock). Unlike something culturally insensitive and disrespectful, like Mr. Baseball, which pokes fun at Japanese culture and way of life in an ugly effort to garner laughs, Coppola illustrates the differences without taking anything away from either culture. Two lonely Americans stuck in a Tokyo hotel, both contemplating their own lives, trying to make efforts in their interpersonal relationships, find each other and somehow find friendship and solace in their acquaintance. This, too, is something many films have tried to do (older man, younger woman), but they degenerate into lurid and unrealistic love affairs or somehow seem too familial (father-daughter, mentor-protege) in their portrayal. With excellent writing from Coppola and excellent performances from Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, the relationship is both believable and refreshing. Lines are not crossed, though there is tension between the two.
Overall, I left the cinema feeling carried away by a mood, nostalgic for that sense of tension, nostalgic for Tokyo (or at least for that sense of being an outsider but finding acceptance with someone as uncomfortable or alone as I felt).",1075161600,12,1485,5.432900432900433

The setting is cool because I am pretty sure most people haven't been to Japan, or if they have haven't probably experienced in quite the jet set way the characters experienced it in the movie. Bill Murray gives his most likeable performance since Rushmore. Scarlett Johansson was hot. The sound track was pretty good. It has that whole ""outside of hollywood"" appeal going on, and depending on who you are that is a big selling point (probably the biggest selling point.)
I guess the big problem is that it all seemed so luke warm. Scarlett Johansson's character could have used some more development, all we know about her is that she was a philosophy major and apparently her husband thinks she is sort of snotty. Bill Murray's character was wonderful in contrast, you can see how he could enjoy
Also on top of all that Scarlett Johansson didn't seem to fit her role well at all. I suspect the only reason she got her part in the movie was because she co-starred in ""Ghost World"" and that fact adds to the ""outside hollywood"" (aka indie/arthouse) flavor this movie was going out of it's way to achieve.
Maybe that is another problem in of itself, the fact the movies seems to be patronizing the arthouse crowd with those long winded shots of Scarlett Johansson observing Japanese culture in a conundrum.

I expected the two stars, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, to actually make a break from their partners and lives and flee Tokyo.  The reality of the film was much different.
By and large, ""Lost in Translation"" is a study in human behaviour.  It provides the film goer with an inside view of the interaction between a middle aged man and a twenty something girl.  Their worlds and backgrounds are very different but they come together in Tokyo where they both share a common puzzlement with Japanese culture as well as similar degrees of dislocation with their respective spouses.
Although the film moves slowly and has no real plot, it remains compelling.  Will the couple become sexually entangled?  If so, how will they deal with their partners?  Will the couple arrange to see more of each in the future?  None of these questions is answered with clarity.  The film seems to roll forward in slow motion with the audience acting like voyeurs to private lives.  The film becomes quite engaging as the viewer is almost hypnotised by the manoeuvrings of the couple.

Scarlett Johansson is near sublime as another stranded American and the two create the kind of low key magic that is near impossible to find in a mainstream movie these days. Usually we get the sort of forced sparks that a Meg Ryan movie pummels us with.  Here, director Coppola, sets up a camera and photographs the proceedings without leading us in any particular direction.  The result is a wholly satisfying (kind of breathtaking) little movie.  Murray and Johansson are perfect together and the ending, when they at last part ways, is just as dynamic as anything that TITANIC or YOU'VE GOT MAIL delivered.

1509905,4,B00005JMJ4,"I've heard talk that this is a kind of autobiographyc movie. Sofia Coppola's marriage to Spike Jonze was not going very well, and this movie was something like a mind-release for the young director. If she tried to pass on to the audience a feeling of impotent boredom, then she did a very good job.
The story revolves around a week or so in the lives of two people: a somewhat decadent movie star named Bob Harris, played by an aged and dry Bill Murray, and a young girl whose marriage isn't going so well, played by the incredibly convincent Scarlett Johansson. They meet in Tokyo, where Murray is shooting a whisky commercial, and Scarlett is passing most of her time in the hotel room while her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) goes out to do his job.
The movie is well enacted and has some sincerely hilarious scenes. Bill Murray is great as the midlife crisis striken man. The scene where he's shotting the commercial is fantastic. The best thing about ""Lost in translation"" is that it is simple, and real. The relationship between the two characters, while odd, is realistic, and I think most of the people watching the movie could relate to what they were watching on screen.
The only thing I didn't like is that ""Lost in translation"" is, at times, too slow, and tiresome as well. As I've said before, I think Sofia Coppola wanted to transmit the boredom she felt to the scenes, and this she made properly. Otherwise, a very good and interesting movie, with top performances by the two main actors.
Grade 8.2/10",1075075200,2,1525,4.651851851851852
1509906,4,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation has been praised by countless critics as the singular indie gem of 2003. Personally, I found House of Sand and Fog and Monster to be far more compelling viewing, yet I cannot criticize reviewers who lavished this film with four-star reviews and glowing rhetoric. This is an original piece of work, with a decided air of wisdom, that simply didn't connect with me deeply at any point. Director Sofia Coppola provides several long silences for what one can only assume is viewer introspection. Judging from the film's enthusiastic following, Lost translated art into life quite well.
For me, I sympathized with the characters more than I empathized with them. I was unable to find an ""in"" to become emotionally engaged in the plot. The characters were recognizable, but difficult for me to identify with. For that reason, I felt detached--like a viewer of rather than party to the experience--for the length of the film. Instead of wise, the film felt wispy. It was entertaining while it ran, but once the credits rolled, it immediately began its rapid fade into the nether-regions of my memory.
But, despite these screenplay issues, the acting and direction absolutely stand out as among the best work in recent memory. If the material had been stronger, this potent combination probably would have churned out a film truly deserving of Best Picture consideration. Bill Murray gives his best screen performance ever as Bob Harris, a B-list American movie star who is shipped off to Japan for a big money liquor endorsement. Away from his family and home country, Harris feels the pangs of isolation and depression. The sporadic calls to his wife reveal a woman who is distant, and a relationship that has long since fizzled.
Harris can't sleep a wink, and spends a great deal of time in the hotel bar, where he meets young newlywed Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Charlotte, a recent college graduate with a degree in philosophy, is married to a photographer with seemingly no interest in her; he prefers to hang out with the ditzy airheads he shoots. Both with equal desperation to escape their surroundings, Bob and Charlotte strike an unexpected and deep friendship. We believe they are soul mates, yet the circumstances are damning. Can they drop everything that's become so achingly familiar and try to start their lives over again, perhaps more along the lines of what they had hoped they'd always be?
As good as Murray is, and he is absolutely terrific, Johansson taps into a wonderful intangible that makes her presence on the screen thoroughly intoxicating. She shares palpable chemistry with the much-older Murray, making the bond between them feel all the more genuine. Director Coppola takes full advantage of this, with inventive visuals and direction that is so sure-handed it comes as a shock Lost is her sophomore feature effort. There are literally a dozen different lingering shots that could easily work as effective poster images.
For all those reasons, it is frustrating the film itself isn't stronger as an end product. Even the beginning, with several big laughs, just leads to a bit of a letdown when comedic momentum runs out in the third act. But, despite numerous imperfections, any Oscar buzz on the film is much appreciated. Nothing would please me more than to see Lost in Translation's ""David"" vanquish the Lord of the Rings ""Goliath"" that has turned cinema toward epic moviemaking and away from the intimate human stories that move mountains so much more effectively than an army of the dead.

And while I'm at it, Just because someone studied philosophy (which is a joke anyway) or dabbles in flower-arranging or is stuck in a dead-end marriage- that don't make her deep.

1510036,5,B00005JMJ4,"Okay, most people have a top ten list, but actually this is the *only* movie I've seen this year that's got everything: great acting, an intelligent script, beautiful camera work, an exotic setting shot with subtlety and flair. It's funny, sad, and sexy.
Others have summarized the plot so I won't repeat that here. I will say that Bill Murray is perfect as the weary, wary semi-famous actor doing liquor commericials for big money in Japan. There's not a moment that feels overplayed. He just manages to be completely believable, second by second. Like all great actors, he reveals by witholding-- it's clear he desires the beautiful Charlotte (played with equal perfection by Scarlett Johansson); his tenderness toward her, the intensity of what he yearns for is as clear by what doesn't happen as by what does.
Johansson perfectly plays a 20-something wife, whose photographer husband is more interested in work and glitz thanin her. She's looking for answers in self-help tapes, Buddhist temples, ikkebana (Japanese flowerr-arranging) and late-night calls to uncomprehending friends. There's a killer scene in which he lets her stand there while a Hollywood ingenue gushes over him, and again when he barely suppresses his eagerness to be out of their Tokyo hotel room and on the road.
While both characters are lost in their marriages, neither spouse is flat or easily dismissed. Charlotte feels lost in the world; at sea in  life and marriage. Bill Murray's character is just over-the-hill as an actor, not-quite-but-almost-famous. His wife keeps faxing him bitter notes and Fed Exing capret samples. He's jet-lagged, lonely, and alone. But this is not a sad sack movie. It's really about the ineffable relationships that can form and even forge a life without quite changing the course of it. And it beautifully captures not only Tokyo, and its blurring rushed pace, but also those encounters of youth which we half-remember and never wholly forget.
Coppola's script is subtle and perfect, the pace is European-style -- which is to say, human scale. The scenes of Japan are breathtaking, making a totally foreign place seem as real as the chair in which we sit. She captures the dreaminess of youth, its tempting possibilities and terrible loneliness and beauty. I think that's what makes it seem like such a fresh and youthful film-- even though Murray is front and center throughout, it's really a movie told through the lens of youth.
This is the ONLY movie I want to see more than once this year. It belongs in that precious category of movies like ""Falling in Love,"" ""Swept Away,"" ""Indochine"" that leave a lasting impression because they feel so pure and true.",1074729600,9,2672,5.018018018018018

1510038,5,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation,"" is on my top ten list. I believe it is number eight. It had great preformances, great story, great comedy, great heart, and it was just overall a great movie. In one of my earlier reviews I think I mentioned that it is not hard for me to like a movie, but sometimes it could be hard for me to love a movie. I really did truly love this movie, and during it I could connect with the characters. It also made me think. It took place in Japan and there was one scene where Scarlett Johansson is going sightseeing was a very beautiful scene because I was able to see Japan the way another person might see it. You could also appricate how other people feel about the certain sights.
Bill Murrey stars as Bob Harris who is an American actor of film, in Japan for a short period of time to shoot a seris of commericals for a brand of Whiskey. Scarlet Johannson is ia graduate named Charlotte who is in Japan and in the same hotel as Bob except for a different reason. She is there for her photographer husband John, but she does not have to do any work at all. Bob and Charlotte are not happy in their marriages and lives. Bob is in the middle of a mid life crisis, and although Charlotte loves her husband, she wants to go home where she can speak American again. Charlotte also is upset that John is spending alot of time with Kelly, another American who already knows and likes John. Since both Bob and Charlotte have trouble sleeping they begin to spend alot of time together. Bob stays in town longer to appear on a tv talk show and they become friends, while also becoming a little more happier in life.
I am still thinking about what kind of movie this is. A comedy or a drama. It's one of those confusing genres like ""About Schmidt,"" or ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" It is a mixture of comedy and drama. But I want to talk about the very last scene. It is the last scene with Bob and Charlotte together in Japan and Bob whispers something in her ear. But you don't hear what he says. It could be anything. He could be saying goodbye, or saying where she could reach him, or even something else. But the reason why they don't tell you is because you don't need to know. At that point in the film, you don't have to know everything that Bob and Charlotte have to say to each other. They deserve privacy and that is exactly what the director gives them. I hope this review makes it to amazon because I feel that I thought alot about this movie as I wrote about it. My feeling for it are very thoughtful, and the more I think about this movie, the more I like it.
ENJOY!

1510040,5,B00005JMJ4,"In the UK Lost In Translation has only been on release a couple of weeks, and when I finally got round to seeing it last night I was blown away.  The movie's about two people who find each other at a time in their lives where nothing seems to fit, where they're desperate, bored and lonely.  Bob Harris (Murray) used to be a famous movie star but now he's sold out, travelling to Japan to film a set of whisky commercials.  Staying at the same hotel is Charlotte (Johannsson), who is the centre of the realisation that she doesn't know her husband of two years (Ribisi) and feels unable to explain it to anyone.  The two people eventually meet, finding solace in the amazing backdrop of Tokyo arcades, temples and karaoke bars.  Many may accuse the film of being boring, and it's true, nothing really happens.  But that's the point.  The characters don't need any plot contrivances to push their relationship forward.  This is a movie about the kind of meeting of someone you know you're in love with from moment one, your soul-mate, but knowing that it can never work out.  In a lot of ways this sounds clichd, but LIT is anything but.  It's focus on the blossoming relationship of the couple is inspiring.
I've never seen Murray in a better role, his kind of world-weary character hidden behind a comic defense is nothing short of brilliant.  Johannsson is a genuine star in the making, and deserves the highest kind of praise for her performance.  Holding herself confidently with a hidden vulnerability, it's a multi-faceted performance which complements Murray's one perfectly.  There are also some nice supporting turns and characters hidden here as well.  Ribisi (narrator of Coppola's previous movie The Virgin Suicides) is just the kind of person you meet in real life who's primarily concerned with image, with having the perfect wife and the perfect job, rather than whether this is what he really wants.  There's also a hilarious character in a young actress starring in a kung-fu movie.  If Bob and Charlotte are the emotional centrepiece of the movie, then she is the laughs.  Pretentious, self-abosorbed but totally believable, she's a great comic actress.
Crucially, Coppola proves with Lost In Translation that she's a dab hand at creating dreamy landscapes, believable relationships and subtly complicated characters.  It's particularly impressive that she not only directed but also wrote the movie and shows her to be one of the most promising new directors in Hollywood (alongside Christopher Nolan).  Just like The Virgin Suicides, there are a lot of silent shots of landscape, of characters staring into the distance.  With Lost In Translation, much of these shots are of Johannsson visiting temples or watching flower arranging.  These provide a nice counterpoint to the humour the film makes of Japan in the director of Bob's commercials and a hilarious Japanese talk show.  LIT is an achievement of the best sort: gently humorous, beautiful, and genuinely touching.",1074556800,6,2991,4.9758551307847085
1510041,5,B00005JMJ4,"I enjoyed this movie a lot for many reasons, but have to say that I can understand those who might have a different opinion. I think it somewhat depends on your ability to connect with the sense of alienation in a strange city and also, how much the two main actors have managed to capture your heart. They did capture mine.
I experienced ""Lost in Translation"" as a movie about alienation - not only in a foreign, different city but also the feeling of alienation in your ""home"" or amongst those who are supposedly the closest to you. How suddenly in a different place, which makes you a lot more vulnerable, Charlotte's husband becomes a man she is not sure she knows. I also think that the movie has a very strong declaration about the total alienation of human kind at the face of technology - or so I understood it.
This is a story of two people lost in Tokyo. Tokyo is both ugly and captivating in this movie and you feel so very tired...The main characters are suffering severe Jet Lag but I assume they are also mentally tired from all the sights and sounds (there are several scenes filmed inside a sort of video game arcade which holds hundreds of noisy stations) and the need to try and figure everything out, even the most trivial things (such as having a shower).
Later in the movie I understood Tokyo to also be a symbol of human alienation everywhere. Off course Tokyo is an easy symbol as the Japanese culture is so totally different. Size, food and humor are so different -- but the movie is not about Tokyo, only the feeling that Tokyo gives you.
Two people lost in a foreign city and in their personal lives are able to reach a high level of friendship. It is very interesting to note that the director made this relationship one of friendship that is very expressly in a higher level then sex. As if not to jeopardize or make the friendship ""dirty"" in any sort of way. In fact, when Bob does have a sexual encounter, it is portrayed as something he regrets (according to his behavior, not words).
Bill Murray's dry, cynical sense of humor is not lost in this movie and is totally fitting the character he plays. Bob Harris is a tired person, who is not only jet lagged but also a little tired of the life he is leading. Scarlett Johansson plays a smart, cynical young college graduate (""Not everyone studied in Yale"", says her husband) who is amazed from the feeling of loneliness she already holds in such an early stage in her life.
The encounter and friendship of these two people lasts only a few days and does not have any future, but manages to reach high levels of closeness, which as always seems to be the only answer to alienation.",1074470400,5,2660,4.452868852459017

But don't worry, ROTK is #2 and will not move from there for any movie! This movie is so good! I loved every minute of it! There wasn't a bad part in the movie! I didn't get bored or tird at all!

1510108,5,B00005JMJ4,"This is a beautiful and masterfully crafted piece of art. Charlotte and Bob are two people who are at different places in their lives, yet they both feel a bit lost. She has recently graduated from college, is unsure of what she is meant to be, and is just realizing that the honeymoon period of her marriage is coming to an end. He is a movie star whose career has reached a plateau and whose relationship with his wife has become more focused on the practicalities of choosing carpet color and taking care of the kids. They both need a kick-start, something to motivate them.
This is a place in life that everyone in the audience can identify with, and Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray play these roles with the perfect combination of sympathy, subtlety, and ironic humor. You like the characters without feeling sorry for them.
The setting in which they meet, an impersonal modern hotel in the heart of Tokyo, where both are jetlagged and are not entirely thrilled to be, is a metaphor for the lonliness and isolation they both feel in their lives. And thus an unspoken kinship develops. They are neither emotionally nor physically intimate with each other, after all, they just met. Their friendship unfolds slowly and naturally, and their connection is based on the experiences rather than the intimacies they share. This makes the friendship that develops between them very believable despite their vast age difference. What results is a sweet, funny movie with a lot of heart that is not overly sentimental.
It's the best movie I've seen in many years and the only one I've been inspired to write a review for. I highly, highly recommend it.",1074297600,2,1650,4.7727272727272725
1510109,5,B00005JMJ4,"I saw Translation for the first time and liked it, but didn't really know what they saw in the movie that was so beyond-belief spectacular. But alas, I believe that every movie deserves a second chance, so recently I sat down and experienced director Sophia Coppola's Lost In Translation again.
  Lost in Translation tells the story of Bob Harris (Bill Murray in a role tailor-made, if not even Heaven-sent for him), an American movie star that comes to Tokyo to film a whiskey commerical for which he will be paid 2 million bucks. Staying in the same Tokyo hotel is Charlotte (Scarlett Johanssen, radiant and mature at only 18), a newlywed tagging along with her rock photographer husband, John (a typically awkward Giovanni Ribisi). Along the way, Charlotte and Bob run into each other and begin a 'brief encounter' that profoundly affects them both.
  When the movie hits you right, it's a pure pleasure from its unassuming start (a beautifully lit shot up Johanssen's underwear-clothed behind) to its ambiguous but meaningful ending. It begins as a comedy of culture clash, Harris sarcastic and confused at the Japanese when entering his hotel, and even more befuddled in a hilarious scene where he shoots the whiskey commercial. Coppola delivers Bob into her movie with the impression that it'll be all about him, but Charlotte enters the story, and we're never quite the same. Scarlett Johanssen plays Charlotte with just the right amount of emotion that her initially morose and soul-searching character doesn't seem silly. At one point, she tearfully admits over the phone, ""I don't know who I married."" Bob, on the other hand, seems to have it made, but Murray lets a current of loneliness run across that memorable face. He gets comical faxes from his wife about bookshelves and carpet samples, but he gives off the impression that he's come to the point where he doesn't even care anymore. Bob is certainly alone for a time in Tokyo, but Murray alludes that things at home aren't too hot either.
For the first third of the movie, director Coppola displays her first brave choice in filmmaking by keeping Bob and Charlotte apart. Upon my first viewing of Translation, I wasn't convinced of Coppola's choice to keep the movie so predominantly low-key, but I've realized that there's a reason for it. The movie sustains this amazing vibe that doesn't stunt its progress, but propels it with a driving fluidity. A few times, though, Bob and Charlotte do see each other without officially meeting. One time in particular occurs in a crowded elevator - the two glance at each other, faintly smile, and possibility is born. The first section of the film doesn't just serve to show its two characters completely apart - it makes you think of how many life-changing connections you've missed in the past by just being passive and solitary.
The two meet and begin voyages out into the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, and the film takes on a perspective that differs from its earlier view. Before, we saw Bob Harris and Charlotte, respectively, at their most private and vulnerable. While out on the town, the film seems to sit back and just let them have fun. Thank God, for Bill Murray's rousing rendition of Elvis Costello's ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding"" is a blast. During this time, it seems that Bob and Charlotte have forgotten their insomnia and loneliness, but it's not gone forever. Even during their night on the town, we see moments where they sit silently, pensive and confused. The movie is a comedy in some sense, but it escalates into a pervading tragic feel. At one point, Charlotte says to Bob: ""Let's never come back here again, because it will never be as much fun."" They had fun, but only in the sense of putting off more loneliness.
It takes a while, but the motivations of each character become fully-realized in a marvelous scene where Bob and Charlottelay fully-clothed in bed together. Here, they handle the 'big' questions in life, and not ""Where did you go to college?"" or ""What did you want to be when you were little?"" but ""What is my purpose?"" and ""Does marraige get easier?"" I was amazed at the honesty of the character's responses. Bob relates to Charlotte the experience of having children and the ongoing struggles of marraige, but a tinge of fear and apprehension runs through his speech. Charlotte hasn't really figured things out for herself yet - she says she's tried just about everything but hasn't found that niche. Coppola's screenplay makes the statement that both are in the same exact emotional limbo. Charlotte is confused and worried, but Bob is regretful and washed-up. In a way, these two are some form of deeply odd soul-mates. That is the heart and soul of Coppola's amazing work.
Translation has great comedic flair with Murray's wonderful work, but it's also perhaps one of the saddest and most moving films I've seen in a long time. It's some form of a romance, too, but it's not about when they'll kiss or when they'll hit the sheets. It also has that Affair to Remember vibe too, where the journey of two souls that find comfort will eventually have to come to an end. Its end, though, defies classification, as does the rest of the film. Coppola simply lets her two amazing leads do the work. When the film does arrive at its final, ambiguous moment, it all just seems perfect. The catchy Japan-pop soundtrack that runs brilliantly throughout the film begins to play, and I find myself with a huge regret: that I won't be able to savor the subtle chemistry of Bob and Charlotte, and that a flat-out masterpiece in American film is at its end.",1073779200,110,5623,4.799793601651187
1510110,1,B00005JMJ4,"This film is a perfect example of how so-called ""experts"" and industry buzz can brainwash the movie going audience into thinking some methodically dull film is some brilliant piece of art. It tries so hard to stay away from mainstream Hollywood that that seems to be its only purpose.
One thing I will admit though is that the acting was very good. I wouldn't say it was Bill Murray's ""best"" performance, just very different. However, I wouldn't be too upset to see Scarlett Johansson at least nominated (if not win) Best Actress come Oscar time.
Admittedly, this all comes from someone who's favorite movies of the year were ""Return of the King"" and ""Kill Bill vol. 1"", however I do like to escape mainstream Hollywood at times and since this film garnered such critical praise I felt it was a must see. Couldn't have been more wrong and couldn't have wasted my time more. I enjoyed quite a few ""smaller"" movies this year but sadly Lost In Translation was not one of them. You're time would be better spent watching films such as ""American Splendor"", ""In America"", or ""Pieces of April"".",1073779200,11,1087,4.696335078534031
1510111,4,B00005JMJ4,"This movie lives up to Sofia Coppola's previous work of ""The Virgin Suicides.""  Coppola proves through this movie that a lot can be accomplished without a lot of action.  Realizations, friendships, and lives unlived that are desperately trying to find a way to release themselves are the main motifs and themes of this movie.  I understand that many viewers don't have a strong respect or appreciation of a movie without a generic love story or gobs of action and unnecessary violence just for the sake of being violent, but this movie is literature in the form of film.
Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are perfect compliments of each other.  One character is a middle-aged man with no real ambition but half a life lived and gone already.  The other character is young, new to marriage, and uncertain of where life goes, how life goes, and what will happen in the end.
I would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed movies such as The Royal Tenenbaums, The Virgin Suicides, Igby Goes Down, and Rushmore.  Existential, different, and thought-compelling are the three words I will leave you with to describe this movie.",1073692800,3,1124,4.858638743455497
1510112,2,B00005JMJ4,"Not even Bill Murray could save this one. Since watching LIT I've been trying to find a redeeming quality. I have two. First, the acting. Both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson were good, especially when you consider what they were given to work with. Second, the movie eventually ended, and that may be its strongest point.
Lost In Translation is the sort of movie that makes you work to watch it. Every scene is so underwhelmingly insignificant it leaves you thinking, 'That scene was pointless...but maybe that was supposed to be the point...so then why I am watching it?' And by then it's halfway through the next scene and well...you get the point. Three out of five scenes could have been removed from LIT and you'd have the same film.
Bob (Bill Murray) is a once famous American actor who is still popular in Japan. He's there doing ads for a whiskey company, and he meets Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson) who's staying in the same hotel with her husband (Giovanni Ribisi), a busy and vacant photographer with whom she has so little chemistry you're left wondering how they ever managed to meet, let alone get married.
After about 45 minutes of the cinematic equivalent of Volkswagen commercials, Bob and Charlotte sense their mutual misery and become buddies. At first it's low key, but when Charlotte's husband packs up to leave town for a few days, whoa-ho! Buckle your seat-belts because...well, no. Still nothing really happens. Bob and Charlotte take little day trips all over Japan and I think it's safe to assume that something's happening, but we can't be sure because Coppola never shows us. In her attempt to reach the apex of dramatic understatement we are repeatedly shown what appears to be a) the beginning of a scene, b) the middle of a scene, or c) the end of a scene. As a result we never really know where the relationship is. The characters are thus weakened and so is the power of the relationship- but wait; I thought this was supposed to be a character/relationship driven movie? Uh-oh.
Then, in what is the penultimate dramatic scene of the film, Bob and Charlotte are lying in a bed late at night and he reveals the staggering, revolutionary news that life and marriage can be hard, and then he touches her foot.
Here's bottom line: Coppola tried to tell us a story by method of understatement - by showing us exclusively the details of the story - but she showed us all the wrong details. For example, take the scene I mentioned above. How does Coppola end it? Fade out. There they are, on a bed late at night, just having had an intense discussion, Bob made some physical contact...black screen.
HOW did that actual, 'real life' scene end? *That's* what defines character and relationships. Did they sleep together or just next to each other? Did Bob carry her up to her room? Did they wake up and have an awkward moment? It's *those* details that Coppola left out and instead chose to show Bob and Charlotte showing up at a bar they didn't realize was a strip bar - and then leaving. Bob slowly teeing up a golf ball, and then hitting it. Charlotte stubbing her toe. Bob having a bizarre encounter with a Japanese masseuse. In other words, absolute nothingness wrapped up in a costume of Coppola's artistic license. This is why we have to work so hard to understand this relationship - because we're always trying to figure out what's happened since the last scene. I'm sure lovers of this film would criticize me for not being 'patient with it,' or 'needing to have everything spelled out.' Untrue. Carefully add up all the excruciating details and busywork in LIT and it still amounts to very little.
So what then is our reward? A peek into the twisted morality of Sophia Coppola. Everything in LIT points to Bob and Charlotte's relationship being a beautiful, misunderstood thing. But let's really look at it. A young couple, married only a year or two - the woman is struggling with her identity as her husband's career takes off. (This is called 'life.' Welcome.) And an actor, always traveling, having problems with his wife of 25 years. (Maybe because he's always away while she's alone trying to raise a family.) So the actor and the confused young woman meet and internally assume that if only they were together in a different world, all their problems would blow away with the wind.
Apparently in Coppola's mind this is a natural, sweet, beautiful occurrence. There is nothing sweet and beautiful about this film - even if it had been done well, which it wasn't, it was still a story about emotional infidelity in two marriages.
And then there's Japan. Look, I've never been there nor have I ever been particularly interested in the nation, but I was insulted for the Japanese after seeing LIT. Coppola chose to exclusively show the outlandish 'weird-game-show' side of Japan. Lesson learned courtesy of Coppola? The Japanese are short, strange people who talk funny, and a week in hell would be better than a day in that bizarre God-forsaken country. Just about every cliched piece of Japanese 'humor' was crammed into LIT, and not once was it funny watching Bill Murray trying to understand Japanese, especially not after seeing it 8 times in 90 minutes. Yes, I understand that she's trying to use it as symbolism for two people trapped in a strange land who only understand each other...yawn. Very 'Screenwriting 101'-ish.
This is a poorly told story that ineffectively tries to convey a very poor message. And I went to this movie *wanting* to like it. Just go rent Stripes and The Godfather; you'll be much more satisfied seeing LIT's star (Murray) at his best and seeing LIT's reason for existing (Francis Ford Coppola) than seeing LIT itself.",1073692800,3,5692,4.756319514661274

1510114,4,B00005JMJ4,"This is a charming and subtle tale of a twenty something woman and a middle-aged film star who happen to cross paths while visiting Japan. John Harris (Bill Murray) has been given a lucrative sponsorship deal, promoting a Japanese whiskey, and is confronted by a few cultural barriers, mainly language, which he handles in obvious and hilarious ways. One of the funniest scenes in the picture is his two-minute stint on a cross trainer machine that runs out if his control. This is run of the mill slapstick humour at its best, pulled off in that familiar Murray style, which even now, when I think of it, brings tears to my eyes. In fact, this really is the only piece of slapstick in the entire film, because what makes this picture special is the subtle dialogue between the two main characters. There's no over acting in this film, but an understated realism and tasteful honesty, which to my mind, should bring a few industry awards to first time director, Sofia Coppola.
Bill Murrey has come a long way over the last twenty years or so. He is one of the world's most funny comedians, with his own unique signature, and has finally reached a point in his craft, where doing a `serious' role will not upset his many fans. He tried this early on in his career, playing the role of Larry, in the second film adaptation of Somerset Maugham's, `The Razors Edge'. Tyron Power played in the original and, of course, this was an impossible act to follow. We did not take him seriously back then, ironically, his performance was superb. In the role of John Harris, the character demanded a particular charm, sophistication and worldliness along with an attitude of self-deprecating humour, which Murrey captured brilliantly, revealing a man at the top of his form. Scarlett Johansson also commanded a fine performance as the lonely and abandoned, Charlotte - her close ups encapsulating every emotion and nuance in each and every scene. She managed to connect with Murrey and display a maturity of character that could not have been done any better. The camera simply fell in love with her face.
This is an enchanting piece of filmmaking about two normal people, lonely and in a strange country, who in any other circumstance, would more than likely not take a second glance at one another, but cross paths and discover and form a connection, and perhaps, something a lot more.  Four and a half stars.",1073433600,2,2397,4.748201438848921

Standout Scene:  It's an old joke, but Murray's bemusement is spot on, as sitting on the set of his latest Whiskey commercial, a torrent of foreign words pours from the Japanese director's mouth only for a less-than-able translator to pass on his wishes in a single word!
Any Good?  Once again, Sophia proves that by recent comparison she is a better director than Daddy Coppola.  While it gets stuck in its own story mid-way, the result is worth the attention.

1510116,5,B00005JMJ4,"There are many great things that I can say about this film, but I will keep it short.  This is the most overall enjoyable film I have seen in years and maybe ever.  A subtle smile appeared on my face from the first shot (not just because of the pink panties....) and steadily grew as I watched Bob and Charlotte's equally subtle relationship blossom.  Sometimes less is more, and the sparse dialogue and restrained performances allow this picture to resonate with powerful emotion.  Through facial expressions (most notably Bill Murray's eyes) and patches of lonely silence, the two leads become a part of the viewer and we lose ourselves in their kindred souls.
  This reinvention of Murray (which started in Rushmore, was polished in The Royal Tenenbaums and will be furthered in The Life Aquatic.  Thank you Wes Anderson) is a marvel to watch and through Lost in Translation is worthy of the Best Actor Oscar.  Scarlett Johansson, though here in a lead role, should be marketed as a Best Supporting Actress and is the best candidate in that field.  She has been great since The Horse Whisperer, was excellent in Ghost World and is a double threat this year along with her performance in Girl With The Pearl Earring.  And what of Sofia Coppola?  She will receive three nominations come the end of this month.  The first for Best Picture as one of the film's producers, another for Best Director, and one more for Best Original Screenplay (which she deserves to win).  The script is smart enough that the characters don't cheapen their relationship by making it ""Hollywood"" and sleeping together (a choice rarely seen in contemporary films).
  I do have one question: Would this film have succeeded the way it does if another actor played the role of Bob?  I'm still not sure, but luckily we'll never have to find out.  Bill Murray has graced this picture with an almost indescibable quality and has aided in creating (along with the talented cast and crew) a memorable film which belongs on the ""Classics"" shelf.",1073347200,,2014,4.791304347826087

That the dozens (hundreds) of better films dealing with the the same themes just don't reach a mass audience and so should be ignored? (There are even several Japanese films that explore similar personal crises with grace and power.)
As someone who really loves thoughtful personal movies--yes even s-l-o-w ones--I was incensed by this piece of drivel. Bill Murray has a dozen better performances under his belt; this one he phoned in. If the director hadn't been named Coppola, if a brilliant lesser-known actor had played the Murray part, this mess would have sunk without a trace. In a few years, the very few people who might try confront this thing will be wondering--""What WERE we thinking?""
I confess: my taste is hardly mainstream. While I am a Bill Murray fan, I conscientiously avoid all movies with Adam Sandler and his ilk. Still, I was heartened to note that the audience in the theater when I saw it were virtually of the same mind. As they filed out, their antipathy was strong and obvious. But it was an art-house, and they were expecting something of merit.
OK--in the first part of the film, there were two interesting--even fine--sequences: one in the studio with the commercial director, the other in the hotel room with the call-girl. The Japanese actors were right on the mark, and together with the situations, they provided perfect setups for Murray to do his thing. After these promising moments, the movie quickly becomes sludge.
Come on, American films are a lot better than this. Think ""The Hours."" Think ""American Beauty."" Think ""War of the Roses."" Think ""Mystic River."" Think ""A Beautiful Mind."" Think ""The Conversation.""

1510200,5,B00005JMJ4,"When Sofia Coppola stormed the silver screen in 1999 with her breakthorugh movie ""Virgin Suicides"", you could clearly see that talent really does run in the family. That film was still somehwat rough around the edges but the touching story, the soft visual language, and her choice for music (Air) made up for it thousandfold. And luckily Sofia hasn't lost an inch of her touch, but has rather grown maturer (both visually and story-wise).
Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is one of those actors who once where on the cover of every magazine and in every blockbuster, but whose career is now on its way downhill. He has found himself a new audience in Japan, a country that still remembers his past glory and is fascinated by everything American. This time he is in Tokyo to promote a whiskey and when his director explains to him in a minute-long intense Japanese monolgoue how he should say those few lines, the translation is, ""Turn to the camera and say the words."" He is literally lost in translation and drowning in his mid-life crisis.
At the same time a young American photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) is staying at the same hotel with his wife. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) has a Yale degree in philosophy, she is married to a guy who doesn't understand that they are slowly drifting appart, and she has chosen to come along to avoid doing nothing at home. She is at the point in her life when everthing seems to be coming down.
And then the actor and the wife meet. They glimps each other over the hotel, seeing that both of them are as lost in their present surroundings as the other one. And one night in the bar (where a failed American singer is entertaining her faithful Japanese crowd) they discover that they both are in the middle of a crisis and in a foreign country where only the whiskey still works.
This story is at the same time about two lonely people who manage to find a soulmate, and a study of the strange little culture that is Japan. And Sofia Coppola knows both of those stories very well. Her ""Virgin Suicides"" was first and foremost a hit in Japan (she is almost a cult icon there), and the loneliness is the one she felt when her husband Spike Jonze was constantly working and she was stranded in a foreign country where everything is a twisted mirrorimage of its Western self.
The visuals and the story are both subtle and the right word for their characterization would be ""observational"". This is not a movie where the viewer is only shown the moments that define a relationship. In this movie we are shown how a relationship forms, how in loneliness the only things we need to create a bond are that same loneliness and a common language to express it. And both Murray and Johansson manage to bring this story and their characters to life with an amazing grace and intense realism.
In Japanese literature and movies, even in paintings, there are many examples of using subtlety to express important feelings. In ""Lost In Translation"" Sofia Coppola uses that very subtlety to speak of the same feelings and does it on a backdrop of modern Westernized Japan. A country that uses a strange magnifying glass on everything American to make it part of their everday-life in ways that the author of the original would hardly have thought possible.
Overall, I think that this is one of the best movies of 2003 and that Sofia Coppola is one of those young directors whom to keep my eye on because her future is deffinitely bright. It seems that weren't it for the fact that Peter Jackson just has to get an Oscar for his magnificent achivement of bringing Tolkien's world to the big screen, Sofia would be my top choice for the Best Director Oscar. But then again Sofia does have a lifetime to collect them for her mantelpiece (or wherever she will place them).",1072742400,3,3783,4.614243323442136

After seeing this motion picture, it becomes apparent that there are traces of the ""former"" Bill Murray present in the above former scenario. Middle-aged actor Bob Harris (Murray) is in Tokyo to shoot a series of commercials for a whiskey company, and, at the same time, wonders to himself: ""Who am I, and what am I doing in ""The Land of the Rising Sun?"". In answering the first question, Mr. Harris, you're a fifty-something individual who's eager to find out what life will continue to have in store for you, and whether or not you'll continue to have a career based on doing only B-rated TV commercials. In answering that all-important second question, Bob, your company sent you to Japan, because they simply said so, as well as to experience a new and different world on a social-cultural level. Like it or not, it is also a test of love and fidelity, when Harris meets up with a twenty-something female (Scarlett Johansson) just a few years out of college, who's in Tokyo to experience how the other half of the cultural spectrum lives, as well as to find herself, so to speak. Here, Bill Murray proves to be the master craftsman, as his suave demeanor and charasmatic wit carries him through the film without any traceable snags or bumps, as he wins the hearts of the local Japanese faithful, regardless of the fact his character doesn't understand neither the national customs nor the language, for all concerned. But, no audience need be ""Lost"" in this particular ""Translation"". However, should you be led astray, just follow the primrose path to your local cinema, and learn the language of cultural innuendo, love (and unbridled passion) at your local cinema this holiday season!",1072137600,,1932,4.8932926829268295
1510202,4,B00005JMJ4,"Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an aging American movie star who is in Tokyo to film a whisky commercial. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is a young wife left mostly alone while her photographer husband is on assignment in Japan. Both of these people feel adrift from their families and alone in a strange city, and both are insomniac. So it's not surprising that they run into each other in the middle of the night in the lounge at the hotel where they are both staying, and they immediately recognize their shared state of mind. Drawn to each other by empathy and mutual mild but persistent dissatisfaction with their lives, Bob and Charlotte spend time together and develop a unique friendship in spite of their differences in age and background.
""Lost in Translation"" is writer/ director Sofia Coppola's second feature film. And contrary to the critical acclaim, it isn't as good as her first film, ""The Virgin Suicides"". ""The Virgin Suicides"" was an acclaimed novel which Coppola skillfully adapted for the screen. Her beautiful  and enigmatic interpretation rightfully established Sofia Coppola as an up-and-coming directing talent. She's a good director, but ""Lost in Translation"" shows that her original writing needs work.
""Lost in Translation"" starts out well enough. We are introduced to two characters who seem like they will be interesting. And several  scenes that cleverly play cultural idiosyncrasies for laughs give us the impression that this will be a comedy, or at least a ""dramedy"". Unfortunately, ""Lost in Translation"" doesn't maintain its comic charm into the second half. And the relationship that is at the center of the film isn't quite credible. The film's biggest problem by far is that Charlotte's character is severely under-written. She is presented as a clever and literate person, but she barely speaks. She doesn't articulate enough about herself to make herself interesting -to the audience or, it seems to me, to Bob either. There isn't much action or other characters that could be used to elucidate Charlotte or Bob's characters. This is a relationship film, a character drama. The relationship and the characterizations rely on what the characters say to each other and about themselves. Bill Murray makes Bob interesting and convincing, and Murray's performance essentially carries the film. But there is so little of Charlotte to wrap one's mind around that her relationship with Bob doesn't seem at all likely. And much of the dialogue between them is unnatural and absurdly clichd. Most puzzling about all of this is that Charlotte appears to be a semi-autobiographical character. Her mannerisms and way of dress are like Sofia Coppola's. They both dabbled in photography. They had both been married two years at the time this film was written. I get the impression that Charlotte is Coppola's younger self. So it is difficult to comprehend why the character is so under-written. Coppola should know her in and out. Does she know Charlotte so well that she didn't realize that the audience would need more clues in order to get a clear picture of the character? I'm just guessing here.
""Lost in Translation"" takes place in Tokyo, but it could take place anywhere. The Japanese city provides a colorful backdrop and the opportunity for some comic relief. The fact that the two characters are somewhat stranded in a foreign land and therefore perhaps more emotionally isolated than they would be at home makes it easier to bring them together. But melancholy insomniacs meet in bars in the United States just as well.  Setting the film in Tokyo could easily be interpreted as laziness or an attempt to compensate for a weak script.
I don't usually give films that are so flawed 4 stars, but Bill Murray's performance and the comic culture clashing of the film's first half make ""Lost in Translation"" worth seeing. Sofia Coppola has plenty of directing talent, but if she's going to write original screenplays, she needs to make sure that her characters are well-drawn and that the tone and freshness of her writing carry throughout the entire film.",1072051200,10,4084,5.056379821958457

I am quite curious to know if any of the individuals below whose gripe is an inaccurate portrayal of Japan or the Japanese people have any firsthand experience with the place.  While I don't pretend to be an expert, I do have a fair amount of experience with Japan, and for me the movie was a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to a land I enjoyed living and working in.  Granted, my excursions to Tokyo were occasional at best, since I was employed in the countryside, but I spent enough weekends in the concrete jungle to see a lot of truth in ""Lost in Translation.""  Is it a sea of neon and crowded sidewalks?  Oh, yes.  Are there innumerable little hole-in-the-wall bars and karaoke clubs, especially in Shibuya and Roppongi?  Oh, yes.  One tiny 2nd floor bar, Sugar High, was a favorite among my friends and I.  Is much of Japanese TV ridiculous and over the top?  Again, the answer is yes...and many of my Japanese co-workers and friends would agree.  And there are prostitutes and strange pornographic offerings as well as huge temples in the middle of a sprawling metropolis.  Essentially, everything in the movie rings true.  Is it missing the normalcy of Japanese life, an insightful look into the lives of any Japanese people?  Yes, but that isn't a problem.  After all, the 2 main characters here are foreigners who are merely there for a short while...not long enough to feel at home or truly get to know the place.  Therefore, the movie shouldn't attempt to make the viewer more savvy or in tune with the ""true"" Japan than Murray and Johansson...after all, if that were the case, it would be harder to relate to their bewilderment and confusion in a foreign land.  Similarly, Coppola wisely avoided subtitling the Japanese dialogue (a technique her father made good use of in ""The Godfather,"" albeit for a different purpose)...we shouldn't understand it (although I think it's perhaps funnier to one who does speak Japanese) since neither main character does.",1071446400,11,1995,4.766763848396502

1510205,4,B00005JMJ4,"It sounds like a fifties-style stock plot: stranded in a strange land whose culture baffles the hell out of them, two lost American souls find solace in each other. Their respective spouses don't understand them-natch-and the foreign world around them has better things to do than to coddle their poor alienated selves.
But writer and director Sofia Coppola's story goes wonderfully right.
Bob Harris (Bill Murray at his leathery best) is a middle-aged actor, lodged at a luxury hotel in Tokyo for a week to shoot commercials (make a trip to japander.com and see if your favorite actors have done the same). Drowning his insomnia and his cultural befuddlement at the hotel bar, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johanson), a woman so young you can practically feel the peach fuzz on her smooth cheeks. While Bob is jaded at best with his dutiful calls to wife and kids and his nightly whiskey binges, Charlotte is downright unhappy. Spending day after day alone in a luxury suite while her photog hubby John (Giovanni Ribisi) is out shooting rock bands, she is as mystified by her marriage as by the Japanese.
The way Bob and Charlotte's tender relationship unfolds is easily one of the most thoughtfully crafted and believable love stories that has flickered across the screen in years. Told in beautifully understated tones, it has the viewer wondering at every turn where this romance can or should rightly go. In the end, we find that the characters knew the answer all along, and it is their ultimate sagacity that allows us to relate to the bittersweet story from start to finish: there is no disbelief to suspend.
Still, the movie is not entirely free of problems. No one is going to dispute that modern Japanese pop culture is a riot-Tokyo is William Gibson's muse for good reasons-and it's OK to say so. But as Murray's typically wry comments (verbally and otherwise) on the seeming madness surrounding the foreign traveler pile up, the unpleasant image of the smug American looking down on the rest of the world may take shape in some viewers' eyes. I've heard it argued that it really isn't unjustified to shake one's head at Japanese idiosyncrasies.

1510206,2,B00005JMJ4,"This is a story told from the point of view of a shockingly self-obsessed girl who finds her poor li'l ol' self stranded in Tokyo Japan. Her hatred for women is shown to us (through her first-person eyes) as a parade of moderately retarded bimbos and an occasional prostitute, punctuated by a sweetheart of a man who is, of course, the victim of yet another bitchy woman. Even this sweetheart (played by Bill Murray) is portrayed as virtuous in precisely only those instances where his interests intersect with the interests of our neglected Princess.
Our poor protagonist has a husband who, like the other women in the movie, is written to be stupid, cardboard, insensitive and prone to inexplicable fits of protracted misunderstanding. Our Princess is also written to have a degree in philosophy and a penchant for knitting - both tokens of *depth* as prop-ish as the hotel wallpaper only more contrived and not as pretty. The racist elements of the movie are shown against the backdrop of a hip soundtrack. The soundtrack wins, giving the audience the moral permission to laugh without feeling boorish.
Long, tedious shots of the winsome girl staring out her hotel window at the sprawling city - which to her is merely a mosaic painted on the window of her hotel/prison - mean to give us a sense of her emotional despair. The cure, Gobs of Attention, is disguised in more palatable forms for ticketholders. Even a trip to the Buddhist temple doesn't move her. Hadn't anyone warned her that monks don't fawn? But the requisite Gobs of Attention eventually come from Murray and this almost makes Princess happy.
Of course this dismal story is told from the perspective of the dismal Princess - consequently, the retarded bimbo, cardboard boyfriend, me-so-hoe-nee prostitute, bucktoothed Japanese folk and all the rest of her projections are submitted as ""givens"" in the screenplay. Her self-obsession is absent from her self-awareness and is therefore absent from the surface of the script, and so forth. What we get is a view of the world from ""behind the eyes"" of a Spoiled Snot who doesn't realize that's what she's letting us see. The view? Pretty damned lonely. We're supposed to blame this on her various projections. Some moviegoers actually do. They're the ones who click ""NO"" on Was-This-Review-Helpful?
By the time Princess receives her panacea, the audience has been bludgeoned into submission and says ""Thank you sir"" for a spoonful of some mighty thin gruel. Tears and cheers are finally milked from the teenage girls. Then the credits roll.

Meanwhile another American, a young woman who is with her husband, is also in the same hotel as Bob. Both become friends because they're both lost and lonely. Because Bob does not understand the language, and is making an ad that he does not care about, we see him being ridiculed by the Japanese, and we also see the Japanese being ridiculed by the film.
Coppola tries not to portray the Japanese or Americans in a good or bad light, we just see each group just as a caricature. We may get a more balanced view of the Americans but this is just because it's their story we're seeing and it's their language we're understanding. It is troubling slightly because although we laugh loudly at the many funny moments in the film, we're also partly uncomfortable with our laughter because we're laughing at the expense of the Japanese through our foreigners' eyes.
Finally, my friend gave the comment that the film was cheapened by the last kissing scene. It was romantic to watch what we thought was a platonic love between Bob and Charlotte, but because of that final kiss, this movie became just like any other movie we watched - typical and predictable.

1510283,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola wrote the ""Lost in Translation"" script with Bill Murray in mind.  Then, she peppered him for almost a year to get him to commit to the film.  She went through trusted intermediaries, wooed him with gifts, letters, the works.
Thank goodness the private Bill Murray (a shy, reclusive individual 180 degress different than his usual on-screen persona) finally relented to Ms. Coppola's very subtle charisma and wiles.  Turns out she did know best:  Murray's take as fading Hollywood star Bob Harris is the role of a lifetime.  If Murray doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for 'Lost' (after getting jobbed for 'Rushmore'), it will be nothing short of criminal.
In stories that appeared in the New York Times and elsewhere around the time of the national release of this film, there was talk of Ms. Coppola's original treatment of this film, and how - as a 10-page draft - it seemed too slight to transform into an art-house film.
But, in simplicity, there is brilliance.  The powerhouse scene of the movie is Murray's combined commercial/photo shoot in Tokyo.  The New York Times reports that the scene came about as follows:
- Ms. Coppola - who possesses a deep knowledge of all things Japan thanks to other business interests there - enivisioned the scene between the Japanese director and Murray.
- She scripted *in English* the ""coaching"" that the Japanese director gives to Murray prior to the first take.  It's filled with purposely ridiculous emotional outpourings of the deep sentiments that Suntory Whiskey will arouse in you.
- She asked a friend to translate the monologue into Japanese.
- She never revealed to Murray the monologue's content and instructed the translator to be oblique and perfunctory (boy, is she ever) when providing him with the on-screen translation.
The rest is just great ad-lib acting by Murray.  His confusion is genuine.  The improvisational stuff he comes up with in the subsequent photo shoot is pure magic.  Only Bill Murray could pull it off with such perfect aplomb.

1510286,4,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray has been building toward his mature, refined performance in ""Lost In Translation"" for the last half of his career, or at least since his droll, brilliant turn in ""Groundhog Day."" As a fading movie star, Bob Harris, he's never been better, and he's just about perfect: A wise, attractive, cynical presence with enough vigor and hope to recognize a much younger kindred spirit when he sees one.
That spirit is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, announcing her arrival as a seriously talented actress), a recent Yale graduate, and both she and Bob are holed up in a luxury Tokyo hotel slightly against their better judgments: Bob is there to film a whiskey commercial; Charlotte skulks around the hotel while her photographer husband is on location. Sofia Coppola's sophomore writing/directing effort - and boy, is it no slump - is at least as much strange love borne of chance hotel encounters as it is about the cultural eccentricities of Tokyo, a gizmo metropolis that nonetheless seems hushed an intimate despite the crowded streets.
After an opening half-hour of culture clash comedy - including a bizarre Japanese prostitute and the sublime, hilarious commercial shoot - that hooks the audience, Coppola blends a detached, bemused commentary on Japan with the May-December romance seamlessly.  She has an ear for honest dialogue, and an eye for well-paced, intimate scenes.
Bob and Charlotte's first meeting at the hotel bar after hours is awkward but sexy. Charlotte is still a work in progress, not tied to any career or family - and not particularly self-involved like most women her age - and Bob, at an age where introspection is stock and trade, is the kind of cynical, finger-snapping well from which she'd like to draw. Johansson doesn't push her acting style - she never rages or pouts or betrays too much emotion through facial tics. But the shy, intelligent performance grounds the picture, and provides Murray the stage to at long last unfurl some Cary Grant charm.
The supporting cast, which includes Giovanni Ribisi as the geek-turned-gadfly photographer and Anna Faris as an airheaded actress working a junket at the same hotel, leave their small marks.  And Tokyo itself is a character, with its bright lights rivaling Vegas. Paired with a warm, near-lullaby soundtrack, Coppola and cinematographer Lance Acord (""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"") punctuate ""Lost In Translation"" with dreamy, gorgeous Tokyo snapshots - Bob's golf outing near Mt. Fuji is the standout - without giving the film over to outright tourism. A club scene is pretty flat, but Coppola redeems it with a funny karaoke sequence inside a high-rise. The movie drags again while it brings Bob and Charlotte to the point where they admit the attraction, or remain coy.
It's Bob who blinks, not surprisingly, but ""Lost In Translation"" ends with a powerful reconciliation that cements their connection. The movie's extended, final goodbye in a Tokyo market is shamelessly romantic, yet one of the great scenes in recent memory. Coppola the daughter is firmly out of her father Francis Ford's shadow with this movie, a darkhorse contender come awards season.",1068681600,4,3157,5.128155339805825
1510287,5,B00005JMJ4,"Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a once popular American actor who now, in his middle-age, has found more acceptance and money from the people of Japan than from his own country. He arrives at a prestigious hotel in Tokyo and is given a royal treatment by his greeters and hosts. He is by himself in the land of the rising sun, his wife and kids having stayed behing in the US while he travels across the globe to do some liquor commercials. This Tokyo excursion will take about a week, and the monetary reward will be quite handsome. Contrast this with Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is at the same hotel tagging along with her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), as he does a multiple-day photo shoot. John is at work most of the time, and so Charlotte is by herself at the hotel, her attempts to keep from being bored proving fruitless. Both Bob and Charlotte are married people, but they are also very lonely people, and that is what ""Lost In Translation"" is all about.
Bob and Charlotte catch glimpses of one another at different places in the hotel, and finally decide to converse in earnest at the hotel bar. The entire plot of the film is about these two people getting to know each other. The story revolves around them. In fact, the story *is* them. Bob, in his early-fifties, is old enough to be Charlotte's dad, but that doesn't matter here. It's not about age. It's about the place, and the points that each of these people are at in their lives. Bob loves his children very much, but we do not sense he feels the same for his wife. We hear her on the phone when she calls him, and the same weary sentiment seems to flow from her voice. They are becoming a couple in name only. Then there's Charlotte & John. Both are young, and both are self-possessed. John is into his photography to the point of neglecting Charlotte. But we get the idea that even if gave her more attention, Charlotte might not really warm up to him. She has issues of her own. If Bob is going through a mid-life crisis, then Charlotte seems to be going through a young-life crisis.
""Lost In Translation"" is about being alone. Loneliness doesn't always mean that someone is physically separated from loved ones or from people in general. One can be alone in the middle of a crowded room. Such is the case with Bob & Charlotte. They're in Japan for a week. They don't really speak the language. Bob's wife is in the US, and Charlotte's husband is always at a photo shoot. The two lost souls find each other at the hotel, spend time with one another, and even sleep in the same bed together. But we know that while this is providing a small comfort for the time being, it is not a lasting solution to their problems. And we also understand that both Bob and Charlotte -- even if Bob's wife were in Tokyo with him, and John was by Charlotte's side all the time -- would still be lonely. Their life struggles lie deeper than what one person can provide, especially the persons they have chosen to settle down with.
This is probably Bill Murray's most understated performance, and it works brilliantly. He lets you in on Bob's emotions without betraying too much sentimentality. He conveys so much with just a smile, a frown, his body language, or simply the look in his eyes. He should get an Oscar nomination for this. Scarlett Johansson, who left me unimpressed in the movie ""Ghost World"" a few years ago, is excellent in her role here. She portrays Charlotte as a deep, troubled, yet intelligent young woman and, like her co-star, does it without overstating it. She spends much of her screen time walking around a hotel room in her pink panties, and does it so simply and matter-of-factly that it becomes both vulnerable and sexy at the same time. Johansson is definitely an actress to watch for in the coming years.
Sofia Coppola has succeeded in creating a sliver of time & place with ""Lost In Translation"". It creates two of the most realistic characters to ever grace the cinema. You forget this is a movie, and start to really care for these people as though they really exist. And you get the feeling that this is a single, solitary moment that will be over with and then fondly remembered by the characters for a long time to come. This sweeps over you before the film is even over, much like when you are in the middle of a special occurence or event in your own life, and you stop and think about the fact that at one point - very soon - it will cease to be the present, and will instead become only a nostalgic memory.
And there you have ""Lost In Translation""",1068681600,"1,069",4562,4.4777911164465785

The two of them come together and find comfort in each other rather than spending their sleepless nights wandering in certain limbo. They search the nights looking for excitement in their lives and end up building a bond that brings them closer.

1510407,3,B00005JMJ4,"Lost In Translation is, in many ways, the cinematic representation of lying on your back in a meadow with your best friends, day-dreaming and watching the clouds go by.  Frankly it's not something I could do everyday, but it's not a waste of time and it's definitely enjoyable while it lasts.
L.I.T. doesn't require you to think very much; as previous reviewers have pointed out, there isn't much of a plot. However, everyone seems to think this is a bad thing - why must every movie have a defined plot?  Why can't a movie just drift along and entertain us gently without resorting to tactics designed to shock, disgust or scare us.
The movie is beautifully put together and the cinematography is stunning. While others may point out a lack of depth in the character, I believe the characters purposefully remain closed to us, much like a stranger you might run into on holiday occasionally and shoot the breeze with, but never really feel like you know.
Coppola also resists the temptation to bring things to a traditional, neat, Hollywood ending, which I personally felt was fantastic - I had no desire to see a naked Bill Murray sweat all over a beautiful young girl who could be his grand-daughter.  The conclusion of the movie itself is similarly perfect - why not let the viewer make up his/her own mind as to how they want the film to conclude?  Do we need to be spoon-fed everything?
The depiction of Tokyo itself is marvelous, and has left me with a strong desire to visit as soon as possible.  It seems so futuristic, and really hits home how much more technologically advanced the Japanese are compared to us, while simultaneously maintaining an awesome sense of tradition.
This brings me to my next point - the portrayal of the Japanese people themselves is borderline racist. Many of the jokes, especially at the start of the movie revolve around the fact that Japanese people are shorter than westerners, and can't speak English as well. Ha Ha.  The double-standard implicit in the film's mindset is also spelled out explicitly when, at the start of the film, the joke is on the Japanese director, for not realizing Bill Murray can't understand a word he says - while at the end of the film the joke is on the Japanese chef, who can't understand what Bill Murray is saying to him.  The suggestion that ""shall we just wait around until a customer comes in and orders [black toe]?"" is also mindboggling.  I would be very interested to read how the Japanese media have reacted to this film...
(Another ""Spot-the-boom-mic"" moment; When Bill Murray's in the bath talking to his wife on his cell the mic drops into frame right above his head! D'oh!)
Overall if you go into this movie with the right mindset, waiting to be carried away on a beautiful journey to a strange and foreign world you'll be happy, but if you expect an emotional moment deeper than ""Please don't let them end up in bed together"" you might be disappointed.  And keep an eye out for those racist undertones...",1067817600,80,2990,4.669201520912548

1510412,5,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola's latest work, is without question one of the finer films of the year.  The stylistic transition from her last feature, The Virgin Suicides, to Lost in Translation is not exactly obvious, but nonetheless shows Coppola directing a more mature-natured picture than she previously has.  Lost in Translation's subtleties are its greatest achievements, while the actor's performances are the impressive allies to a compelling story of love, life, chemistry, and respect.  If at least one Oscar is not garnered from this combination of elements, I will find myself sadly disappointed.
The movie begins with Bob Harris (Bill Murray) arriving in Tokyo, Japan to shoot a commercial for a Japanese-brand whisky.  Upon arriving in the country, it's immediately obvious that he is not completely up for this task.  He arrives at a beautiful hotel where he is lavishly welcomed by the hotel's staff before retreating to his room to alienate himself from the experience.  Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson, is also at the hotel.  She is staying with her photographer husband while his is in the country for work.
The next evening, Charlotte sees Bob having a less than fulfilling time in the hotel's lounge and sends him a drink.  Later that evening, they meet again in the lounge when both are unable to sleep.  An instant bond is established and the two slowly begin to realize that they are the best suited company for one another.
Eventually Bob and Charlotte go out together on the town.  In the midst of being in a completely different culture, where more than the language is a barrier, the two find themselves meeting on a much deeper level than they had originally planned.  The fact that the age difference is obvious to the audience makes some of the subsequent scenes more intense.  You're left to question if the two are going to take the relationship to a sexual level.  You're left to question if the two are truly falling in love.  You're left to question if the age really has any bearing on the chemistry that they feel together.
Therein lays the true beauty of this film.  Although it would be extremely easy to have these two romantically fall in love, they're simply two people that meet on an emotional level.  For lack of better words, they just understand each other.  For the next couple of days they utilize their time to the fullest by enjoying their time together.  They don't want the time to end, but realize that in just a few short days everything in their lives will go back to normal.
During the last evening of the trip, a fire alarm is sounded in the hotel forcing everyone outside until all is clear.  At this point, Bob sees Charlotte and approaches her.  The moment is uncomfortable because, through no intention of his own, Charlotte becomes aware of the fact that Bob has unexpectedly had another woman in his room the night before.  Unable to deny the fact that she has become emotionally attached, Charlotte asks Bob when he is going home.  He replies, ""In the morning.""  At this point, it's in the open and the two realize just exactly how much fun they've had together over the course of their visit to Japan.  This is a friendship that could very easily be taken to the next level, but somehow the two are smart enough to understand that this is something that just needs remain where it's at.
After leaving the hotel to catch his plane home, Bob sees Charlotte walking down the streets of Tokyo and implores the driver to pull over so he can say what he wanted to say earlier.  Unfortunately, and fortunately, we are unable to hear what he tells Charlotte.  We're only left to speculate what it is.  I'm sure most people agree that it can only be one or two things.  It's such a beautiful scene, though.  It's one of the true highlights of cinema in the past several years.
Everything about Lost in Translation is in the right place.  As I stated before, it's the subtleties that make it so great.  Whether it's the witty humor of Murray, the innocence of Johansson, the brief appearances of the small handful of cast members, or the beautiful imagery of Tokyo, nothing has been overdone.
Finally, as I left the theatre, I realized just exactly how much my emotions had been played with.  However, it wasn't until the second time I saw this film that I fully understood why.  On some level I guess I had wanted things to turn out differently, but maturity of the writing actually made this movie ten times more enjoyable than it would have been had it ended the way I wanted it to the first time.",1067385600,4,4570,4.68671679197995
1510413,2,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation is the story of two people who find comfort in each other's company in the wild and bizarre (at least as portrayed in this film) streets of Tokyo. Bill Murray is Bob, a world weary actor who is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Bob, who was a movie star in the 70s, obviously hates being lowered to this level of the show business hierarchy. I grew tired of his perpetual attitude of being oppressed and put-upon. He reveals at one point that he's being paid two million dollars for something like a week's work, and most people have to do far more unpleasant things for a lot less compensation. Bob meets Charlotte, the much younger wife of a self absorbed photographer. I was not all that enchanted with either Bob or Charlotte, but virtually everyone else in the film is a caricature. Charlotte's husband is the conveniently dumb spouse (convenient in a movie about a possible affair between married people); there's also a dumb blonde actress from L.A. (what a concept) who distracts Charlotte's husband. Finally, there is Bob's wife, who we only hear on the phone, who only seems to care about things like the color of carpets. Then there are the multitude of Japanese stereotypes. Most of the humor in the film is the provincial kind where American audiences are supposed to identify with their compatriots, trapped in a land full of wacky foreigners, many of whom are so ignorant that they can't speak proper English! I'm not so PC as to oppose ethnic humor, especially if it's funny, but the spectacle of Asians mispronouncing words in English is just a little old by now. There are also several scenes in which people speak long Japanese sentences to Bill or Charlotte as though completely unaware of the fact that they can't understand it. I suppose there's just no end to the ignorance of people outside the English speaking world. I don't feel that it's unreasonable to stress the language issue here, because the very title of the film implies that it's meant to be of central importance. True, the language barrier can be disconcerting, but, first of all, I'm sure Tokyo has many people who are fluent in English, and secondly, someone on Bob's budget could afford a translator. As for Bob and Charlotte, their interactions maintain the edge of people who are attracted to each other but not  ready to commit to a relationship. This is not a bad thing, but I feel that to get into the romantic mood of the movie you have to buy into the whole scenario of foreigners trapped in a foreign limbo, something along the lines of The Year of Living Dangerously maybe. Lost in Translation is nice to look at, with many great shots of night scenes in Tokyo and the surrounding countryside. Unfortunately, I didn't think the characters or story matched the scenery.",1067126400,9,2795,4.715746421267894
1510414,5,B00005JMJ4,"I've seen Lost in Translation twice already, and I'm probably going to see it a third time shortly. I enjoyed it more than any film since Mulholland Drive, and before that, since Hillary and Jackie. It made me nostalgic for Tokyo, which isn't all that easy to do. For the first time in years, I actually want to go there, to be there.
This film has personal meaning for me because I'm a translator, of Japanese to English. I've spent most of my adult life seeing at painfully close distance what does and doesn't get through in translation, sometimes despite one's best efforts. And I've given up thinking that you can ever get through to someone, on either side of the ocean, who really doesn't care what's over the next hill.
Some reviewers complain there isn't much in the way of plot. I guess that's true. Today I realized that this film is actually an American ""zuihitsu."" Japan specialists reading this know what I'm talking about. There's a genre of narrative in Japan, going quite far back, where the subject matter is basically personal reflection, and there's really no architecture to the progression of ideas. There's a certain similarity to stream-of-consciousness writing -- one observation links to another, and another, and the pleasure comes not from Aristotelian development but from a sense of versimilitude in how one scene, one emotion, fades into the next, on and on. The narrative becomes a montage of emotions. At the end, if you feel the emotions are real, then you feel the narrative was good.
Lost in Translation is kind of like this, I think.
Tokyo is a place where absolutely everything imaginable exists, but it's hard to get a grip on anything definite. It has this shimmering, effervescent quality, but many things are fluid, and not permanent. The city was destroyed twice in the 20th Century, once by earthquake and again by carpet bombing. Now it seems to be constantly destroying and rebuilding itself as it goes along. Very little there is old, and things don't endure.
Especially when you mix in serious jet lag and sleep deprivation and constantly being caught off guard by small dissonances in the culture, Tokyo becomes a place that strips you of your defenses and leaves you very elemental. People form bonds in unique ways when this happens. My girlfriend says this could happen in any world-class city, and objectively I concede she's probably right. But I'm biased to think that Tokyo is particularly likely to have this effect.
So, for me the film and the characters and the emotions are utterly believable and one thousand percent credible. And the way it depicts the essence of the city, this, too, is completely true. To me, that's what makes this film brilliant.",1067126400,15,2712,4.8469827586206895
1510415,5,B00005JMJ4,"I must disagree with the reviewers who are calling ""Lost in Translation"" a racist movie that ridicules the Japanese.

The message was not that the Japanese are ridiculous, but that everything seems strange and incomprehensible when you're in a foreign country - hence the title of the movie.
Yes, there was the flamboyant talk show host, the bizarre prostitute, the eccentric director, the strange TV shows, and a lot of references to Japanese pronunciation of English words. But don't forget that the film also showed, with great reverence, the beauty of a traditional Japanese wedding, a ceremony in a temple, the technological wonders of Tokyo's streetscapes and video arcades, and a traditional flower arranging class. There were also lots of Japanese characters who were not made out to be ridiculous and several American characters who were.
This film is not mean-spirited - it's simply honest about the ways in which people don't understand each other, whether it be across cultures or even within one's own marriage.",1067040000,7,1176,5.035897435897436
1510416,4,B00005JMJ4,"A film by Sophia Coppola
This is a tough movie to describe because there isn't a whole lot of plot (as we would normally understand plot).  There are details that build up the two main characters and illuminate the experiences of Americans temporarily living in Tokyo.  On one hand, this was a fairly interesting movie with a great performance by Bill Murray.  On the other hand, there wasn't a whole lot going on with this movie.
Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an American actor working on commercials in Japan for a while.  He is somewhat estranged from his wife and has not seen his children in a while.  While in Tokyo, he meets a much young woman who is staying in the same hotel: Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson).  Charlotte's husband works as a photographer and he is gone most of the time.  Both Bob and Charlotte are very lonely and feel isolated.  They meet, briefly talk and subsequently they keep running into each other.  Eventually they begin a friendship and they spend time together both in the hotel as well as out on the town in Tokyo.
The movie deals with the friendship of Bob and Charlotte and touches upon the loneliness they feel (as well as the insomnia they share), and through this friendship we are shown what it is like for an American (who barely speaks the language) to live in Tokyo.  We see some of the cultural differences.  Some people have said that this film is racist towards the Japanese in its portrayal of the people and the country, but it felt authentic.  We know that we aren't seeing the everyday life of the Japanese people but rather how two random Americans may encounter some of the Japanese in clubs and hotels.  Of course that isn't authentic Japan, but it is an authentic experience.  Sophia Coppola wrote the screenplay and she is very gentle with the Japanese people, so I guess that I don't quite understand the accusations of racism and cultural prejudice.
This is Coppola's second film and while I feel that this is a much stronger film than The Virgin Suicides, I wasn't as impressed as I felt I should be.  The critical reviews were nearly unfailing positive and glowing, but I felt like something was lacking.  Lost in Translation (the title alludes to how with a cultural and language difference, some things get lost in translation) was a good movie, but because the lack of focus in the plot/story, I found it difficult to really get into it.  I was impressed with the work of both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson, and I appreciate the film a bit more the more I think about it, but I just can't manage to get excited about this movie....and that knocks it down a star.",1066867200,,2627,4.591006423982869
1510512,5,B00005JMJ4,"When you are in a new place, especially in a foreign country, your senses are easily shut down.  Everything is dull, food is tasteless, street noise is muffled, and you feel you are drifting around.  Imagine you are stuck in a highrise office building with central air conditioning for a week.
Then you feel a cool breeze, much like the cool air from the lake when you finally get out of your office in an autumn night.  Suddenly, all your senses come alive, stars shine brightly, the street light is vivid, and you have a sense of euphoria.
That must be the feeling that Bob and Charlotte had when they first made contact in a hotel bar in Tokyo.  Two lonely souls, drifting aimlessly in one of the biggest cities in the world, suddenly found each other.  The encounter, although random, was full of magic.  Before that, when Charlotte was calling her friends, she said, ""I didn't feel anything"".  When the film ended, we saw tears streaming down her cheeks.
This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.  Lonely people will understand it better because they identify with the characters, and they secretly dream about such a magical encounter in their lifetime.",1066780800,2,1176,4.674757281553398
1510513,5,B00005JMJ4,"If you're walking into this film expecting dramatic plot twists, an erotic romance that shocks to the core of Tokyo, or slapstick comedy that Bill Murray is known for, this isn't the movie for you.
Lost in Translation seemed to be like sitting beside a quiet stream. The movie flowed beautifully, and all I can seem to think is that it truly is a piece of art. Rarely in American Cinema do we encounter a movie that doesn't involve risque sexuality, blowing up a car, building or two, or some other overt message being handed to us on a platter because its audience is assumed to be too stupid to put 2 and 2 together.
To even compare Lost in Translation to Bill Murray's other movies is a crime. It cannot be compared to his previous work merely because of the nature of the film itself. It is not meant to be a comedy, nor is it meant to have that earth shattering moral or message that some have complained that Lost in Translation lacks.
It feels to me as though the subtly of the film makes it a greater accomplishment than many of the movies that I have seen in years. I give credit to Coppola for not handing the film to her audience on a platter. The intricacy of the relationship is what makes the movie so wonderful. To digress from the normal Hollywood theme of Young Beautiful Woman/Young Beautiful Man is refreshing and well worth the cost of the ticket.",1066694400,3,1367,4.407114624505929
1510514,1,B00005JMJ4,I was so looking forward to this film.  I love Bill Murray and I really enjoyed Virgin Suicides Coppola's early effort.  But this film is such a mess I don't even know where to begin.  It was trying to explore some very fascinating themes with extremely poor execution.  I just didn't care about these characters when it was all over and I knew that that was not the filmmaker's intention.,1066608000,5,389,4.514285714285714
1510515,2,B00005JMJ4,"Lost in Translation suffers from having no central theme, moral, or fundamental message to communicate.  If it were a mindless screwball comedy it could be forgiven this flaw; however, the movie does appear to have the pretensions of communicating some sort of deeper meaning.  But the best moral of the story that I can come up with is:  people in strange foreign cultures, cut off from family, will bond together and make some bad choices until their return flights depart.  Hardly an earth shattering revelation.
Bill Murray does give a fine performance, and has several opportunities to showcase his ironic wit, especially when filming a whiskey commercial.  The film also functions as an interesting Tokyo travelogue and an introduction to various aspects of Japanese popular culture, including the pachinko parlors, arcades, street youths, strip clubs, and Japanese television.  Bill Murray's visit to an over-the-top gaudy Japanese talk show is another one of the highlights.
Unfortunately, the film's flaws outweigh the positives.  Besides lacking meaning, the plot takes several illogical turns.  Just when Bill Murray's character and the young married woman he meets appear on the verge of deepening their relationship, a much older floozy steals his affections for the night, which he instantly regrets.  This prevents the film from developing into a love story - it's a friend story, and one in which the friends aren't acting terribly rationally.  The young woman whom Bill Murray's character pursues is remarkably directionless; it's hard to believe that someone who graduated from Yale with a philosophy degree would be following her husband on a photo shoot assignment, listening to pop psychology motivational speakers, and crying over her experiences in a Japanese temple.  Some of the humor is more clichd than funny, especially the ditzy blonde American actress.
By contrast, Groundhog Day, which is a more mainstream film, was not only much funnier, but also had a message to communicate, about how one should conduct one's life.",1066608000,5,2050,5.315789473684211
1510516,5,B00005JMJ4,"My review will be similar to others who have also written.  This movie is powerful and yet represents elegance in simplicity.  We have the lonely ""has-been"" actor, stuck in Tokyo doing a whisky commercial.  We have the ""twentysomething"" who is still searching for her identity and meaning in this world.
Two people were placed here by external forces (Murray's employers and Johansson's husband.)  As we see Murray in the bar and Johansson staring out the window, the message is glaring-""I do not fit.""  We become excited when Murray and Johansson find each other.  Together, Johansson and Murray make themselves fit in this complex world they do not understand and ultimately make their own world.  Murray becomes young again as he sings karoke and tours the town with Johansson-only to find the disturbing reality that across the oceans, his wife is concerned with office carpet samples.  Johansson learns about life, that everyone eventually finds their place in it-only to go back to her husband who is concerned with surface-level issues pertaining to his job.
The beauty of this movie is there is no romance between the two.  It is an experience of two people who find each other and form a friendship.  The final scene is one we do not want to see, where they say goodbye.  This movie leaves you satiated and reaffirms the goodness of humanity.  Such a film is, regrettably, a rarity.",1066521600,6,1391,4.897435897435898
1510517,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola claims that she was watching Antonioni before making Lost in Translation, and more than the brief clip of La Dolca Vita shown during the film confirms the influence.  Coppola's deft touch  at creating the atmosphere of two characters adrift in the night, in an urban scene (Tokyo), and within their lives makes the tempo (like that of much of Antonioni) deliberately uneven and evocatively so.  Sometimes our two protagonists are caught in a frenetic rush of night life, while at other moments, they are caught within their hotel room cocoons.  Lost in Translation begins with the comic premise of the difficulty of living, even briefly, in a literally foreign world where a different language is spoken and approximations of your own language are almost incomprehensible.  Lest this concept be mistaken for cultural clich&eacute; and Japan-bashing, the filmmaker quickly makes it clear that Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and  Charlotte feel ""Lost in Translation"" even within their own day to day lives, as connections with their spouses become strained and words no longer seem to connect them in a profound way to other people.  Fledgling attempts at communication, on the phone or in person, are thwarted.  But then Bob, a movie star featured in a Japanese ad campaign for Suntori Whiskey, and Charlotte, the wife of a fashion photographer, meet at a hotel in Tokyo where they are both feeling sleep-deprived and alienated, and they discover that they speak the same language.  The exuberance of their patter is what keeps lightness in a movie that might otherwise strain underneath the weight of (literal) dark as both characters struggle with insomnia.  Coppola's work as a screenwriter is impeccable here, and I hope this spring will see an Academy Award for Lost in Translation's original screenplay.  The chemistry between the two leads is incredible, and, while all reviewers have said this, I will only repeat, this is the role of Bill Murray's career, and his alternating humor, vulnerability, pathos, and playfulness create a tour de force performance.  Murray and Johansson seem utterly in tune to one another throughout the movie, and her performance carries a sincerity and loveliness that underscores even her most ironic or flippant lines with emotional depth.",1066521600,3,2286,5.182065217391305

Two American strangers meet in a Hotel in Tokyo and strike up an intimate, loving friendship. Peppered througout the film are scences of the Bill Murray character worked on film shoots or in studios. In one over the top scene, he is feted by an absolutely manic Japanese talk show host, who is supposed to be the Japanese verison of Johnny Carson.
Scarlet Johansen and Bill Murray have smoldering chemistry, without any cheap scenes between them. She's got an edge to her style and thus distinguishes herself from many of today's young actors/ actresses.
This is not an overt comedy or a tense drama but it will to a more sophisticated audience than most of what is playing today.",1066262400,3,813,4.814285714285714
1510520,3,B00005JMJ4,"As a former Road Warrior, I could relate to being isolated in a foreign city far from home. Of course, I was never, as LOST IN TRANSLATION has it, beached in so culturally unfamiliar a place as Tokyo. Does Cleveland count?
Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an American movie star just arrived in Japan's capital to do promos for Suntory whiskey. His lack of enthusiasm for the gig is obvious and, worse, he's disoriented by the difference in language, customs and working conditions. So, he spends his free time either in the hotel bar, or battling insomnia on his hotel bed while brooding on his marriage doldrums. The extent of his wife's need for his presence back home is indicated only by the carpet samples she fedexes for him to choose from. At one point in a call to the States, Bob wishes that they eat Japanese food more often, and his wife matter-of-factly suggests that he just stay there and have it every day.
Down the hall is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young wife accompanying her pro photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), on a business trip. Hubby is so involved with the job that his wife feels like excess baggage. Charlotte wanders the city unmoved by the experience of discovery, and spends sleepless nights staring out the window at Tokyo's glitter.
Though Bob and Charlotte could pass on the sidewalk in any American city and not even notice, in this vacuum created by loneliness and the Hollywood scriptwriters, the two discover each other despite a 30-year difference in age.
Murray's understated performance is a gem, and may garner him an Oscar nomination. Bob's potentially a funny guy, but his innate sense of humor is being suffocated by boredom, weariness, and the irritation of being in some incomprehensible place where he'd rather not be. For her part, Charlotte drifts along like a zombie. It's only in the company of each other that the two come out of their respective funks.
As much as I applaud Murray's performance, perhaps the best of his career, and admire LOST IN TRANSLATION as an intelligent and perceptive production, I found it less successful as an entertainment vehicle. (After all, that's why I spend money to go to the moving picture show.) While I did occasionally cackle appreciatively, most strongly during the sequence when Bob is beset by a misguided hooker, the film was so glacially paced that it got me fidgeting. I kept waiting for something - anything - to happen. Not an FX-laden kung fu or car chase action sequence, of course, but perhaps some outburst of passion or raw emotion. The plot contained no conflict. It was like watching the poor devils in a slow post office queue strike up polite conversations with fellow sufferers fore and aft to alleviate the tedium. Perhaps it's just because I didn't sympathize with Bob's predicament. His seemed like a lost opportunity to catch up on his reading. Send me to Tokyo, please!",1066262400,5,2900,4.837022132796781
1510521,3,B00005JMJ4,"There are some movies that, for little apparent reason, get rave reviews from the critics.  Moviegoers rush to the theater, eager to see what all the fuss is about.  ""Lost in Translation,"" directed and written by Sofia Coppola, is one of these movies.
Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson play two lonely souls visiting Japan.  Murray is Bob Harris, a has-been actor who is shooting a whiskey commercial for big bucks.  Johansson is Charlotte, a beautiful Yale grad who is newly married to a dim-witted photographer.  She has no direction in her life, and she is beginning to realize that her marriage may have been a mistake.  Since Bob and Charlotte are staying in the same hotel, and both are feeling alienated and lost, they gravitate towards one another and strike up a friendship.
A major problem with ""Lost in Translation"" is a script that fails to help us understand very much about either character.  Bob is bored with his marriage and career.  Charlotte, who majored in philosophy, is obviously very intelligent, but she married a man who is her intellectual inferior, and she has no profession of her own.  However, we never find out why Bob is so dissatisfied with his life.  Nor do we find out why Charlotte, who appears to be a thoughtful and sensitive young woman, married a shallow ignoramus and failed to pursue a career of her own. The friendship between Bob and Charlotte is sweet, but their heart-to-heart conversations are not particularly deep or enlightening.
Kudos, however, go to the gorgeous cinematography, which includes amazing shots of Tokyo night life, a panorama of the city's skyline, and a lovely and tranquil scene of Buddhists worshipping in a temple.  There are also some very funny moments generated by Bill Murray, especially one in which he shoots a whisky commercial while imitating famous personalities.  More of this humor would have been welcome.  Johansson has an ethereal beauty and sweetness that shine through, but her character is so undeveloped that she remains a cipher until the end of the movie.
In short, ""Lost in Translation"" looks good, and has a few funny and touching moments, but it lacks the spark and depth that makes a movie truly memorable.",1066003200,,2201,4.916216216216216
1510618,5,B00005JMJ4,"Early attempts to dislike Sophia Coppola for nepotistic reasons failed about half-way through watching her first major outing, 'The Virgin Suicides'. With 'Lost in Translation', she proves herself a worthy successor to her father and to my sensibilities, will likely surpass him (if she hasn't already). Bill Murray is already getting 'Oscar' buzz, but who cares about the Oscars. Bill Murray's been a great actor for a long time, and if you didn't believe it before, this film will convince you. Scarlet Johansson has been impressing the indie world for awhile with her talents, and her performance in 'Translation' shines. Only with these performances and the carefully meted out patience of Coppola could such a film as this work, and as it works without any noticeable flaws: it is a marvel.
Bill Murray is Bob, a famous actor doing a commercial, and Scarlet Johansson is Charlotte, an educated wife of a working/traveling not-to-bright photographer. Both are questioning the paths of their lives and given ample time to do it in the overwhelmingly alien Tokyo. Much of the films loneliness is conveyed with long shots of cityscape, almost always through windows, emphasizing the smallness and separateness of the characters. The fact that no one speaks English only adds to Bob and Charlotte's clumsy aloneness. They are literally estranged from the world. For Bob, his wife might prove a source of comfort, but the long distance calls to her prove even more alienating; their understanding of each other has developed into an unshakable pattern. For Charlotte and her husband, she admits that she doesn't know who she's married, and he is too oblivious to see her struggle; his blindness emphasized by the fact that he always wears sunglasses. When Bob and Charlotte meet, becoming fast friends, it's as if the world circles around them, becoming an impregnable neon capsule. But real life does invade, and the realization of their lives together is disturbingly dour. Unbelievably, Ms. Coppola dodges all the Hollywood clichs - which in a film of this type is like crossing a mine-field with a herd of cattle - and somehow avoids being overly sentimental or preachy. The characters simply live their lives across the screen - practically just playing themselves. Bill to Bob, Scarlett to Charlotte; in one moment, there is almost a sketch comedy (harkening back to SNL days) of Bob trying to communicate with an elderly Japanese woman. As he goes through all his Bill Murray antics, some extras in the background begin laughing. This hilarious moment becomes an almost painful awakening to the powerful truths of loneliness - especially in such a 'killer' industry - as  the scene connects the fictional to the real; the Bob to the Bill. All that looking through glass and seeing reflections becomes so much like looking through a camera, or watching the stranger of one's own self in a mirror. Like the play within the play of Hamlet, they are acting out their own lives. And the end result is astounding.",1065744000,6,3013,5.013972055888224
1510619,4,B00005JMJ4,"Sophia Coppola has done it again and made a very enjoyable and physically appealing movie.  Although there is very little plot the movie works because of the actors, music, and scenery.  Bill Murray is wonderful and maybe will finally get the attention for being the fine actor he is.  Scarlette is stungingly beautiful and always plays her parts so well.  She never over acts and no just how to light the screen up with her bright smile.  The movie is an enjoyable treat and worth ever bit of the $9 or so to see it.",1065744000,2,517,4.4
1510620,5,B00005JMJ4,"I loved this film.  I was hesitant to see this film considering I was not a huge fan of the Virgin Suicides and wasn't exactly sure what kind of film it was supposed to be.  Yet from beginning to end I was simply awestruck at the brilliance of the story, the romantic tensions, the innovative cinematography, and the Oscar-worthy performances by Bill Murray and the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson.
Lost In Translation captured the essence of a dialogue-driven story, yet it spoke more during its silent sequences than when the actors were speaking.  It was a bit like Woody Allen's Manhattan in the fact of the age difference between Murray and Johansson and the clever witty humor.  However, unlike a Woody Allen picture, it focused less on sexual relations, and more on pure innocent affection.
The music from this film is also a very important factor in the absolute brilliance of it.  The overall mood that it sets for the picture renders emotions that make you not only feel love and sorrow for the protagonists, but makes you feel the love that they share.
This is without a doubt the best picture of the year!",1065744000,3,1113,4.716494845360825
1510621,4,B00005JMJ4,"One of the oft-stated purposes of the creative arts, beyond that of simple entertainment, is to enlighten the spectator by inspiring reflection on his or her own condition.  Works of creative expression can thus involve us in a kind of dialogue with the work that illuminates aspects of our lives in ways we might not have considered otherwise.  Such works don't need to be perfect masterpieces, or even necessarily good as defined along any number of narrow guidelines.  They only need to touch a chord, evoke an emotional reaction and give us pause.
Lost In Translation engages us in that dialogue through an unconventional love story told without the melodrama typical of most films of this stripe.  The premise is straightforward: Bob Harris (Bill Murray, in one of his best roles), a fading Hollywood star visiting Tokyo to shoot a commercial because he needs the money, meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is visiting Tokyo with her self-absorbed celebrity photographer husband.  The spiritual dislocation both Bob and Charlotte have probably been carrying around for some time comes into bold relief due to a mixture of loneliness, cultural isolation and insomnia, and as they run into each other more often in the bar of the hotel where they are both staying, they spark with the sense of kindred recognition.
There is a revealing moment in Lost In Translation where Bob and Charlotte are lying in bed together talking (it bears mentioning that they are both fully clothed and haven't had sex, nor do they ever within the narrative span of the film).  The conversation begins lightly in tone, then gravitates toward the Big Issues we all face --  marriage, children, knowing oneself, growing old -- and winds down with Charlotte lying half-curled on her side facing Bob lying on his back, their rapport and mutual affection having built to this point into something comfortable and relaxed, yet without any physical contact.  Then, just before the scene fades out, Bob reaches out a few inches and very matter-of-factly puts his hand on Charlottes foot, a simple, tender gesture that lays open what this film is all about.
There are a number of moments like this -- the last scene of the movie is particularly touching because of the way director Sofia Coppola stages it -- which are ripe with the knowledge that romance and affection need not lead inexorably to sex, and can offer far greater rewards.  Considered in tandem with Coppolas previous film, The Virgin Suicides, we might in fact be seeing the emergence of a theme in her work concerning chaste relationships between members of the opposite sex who convey a profound sense of intimacy through small gestures.  (For contrast, the aftermath of sexual union in both films is either an embarassment or a severe disappointment.)
Lost In Translation admittedly has its flaws.  Some scenes go on too long, some are unnecessary, and various lines of dialogue should have been rewritten to excavate the truth from inside the cliche.  The poetic style -- unhurried, suggestive, often wordless -- is more common in European films and will be most effective for those who appreciate storytelling that prefers subtle movement over clumsy exposition.  I personally found myself happily lulled by the pacing and, while satisfied at the end, I was sad to be leaving these two characters.  Anyone expecting broad comedy (though there are some very funny parts) or a by-the-numbers chick flick will be terribly unhappy with this movie, but more patient viewers will be rewarded.  To my tastes, by sketching a relationship of almost Victorian restraint inside a brash, indifferent environment, Sofia Coppola has made the most romantic film of the year.",1065657600,6,3709,5.04746317512275
1510622,4,B00005JMJ4,"Have you ever sat through a movie that is really good, has a compelling story, great characters, and yet still felt a little cold?  I mean you really liked the movie, it made you think, it didn't play down to you, and yet you were hoping for little bit more?  Sophia Coppola's new film LOST IN TRANSLATION, is a good movie with a great movie caught inside it.
TRANSLATION stars Bill Murray (Groundhog Day) as Bob Harris, a former hotshot action star at the end of his career.  His marriage may be falling apart, his life is coming unraveled, and he's just been offered two million dollars to hawk an alcoholic beverage in Japan.  Life seems to be getting worse until he strikes up a relationship with an unlikely friend.
Her name is Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, The Man Who Wasnt There) and she just so happens to be in the same boat.  Her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi, The Other Sister) is living a dream and ignoring her.  She's alone in a city of millions.
TRANSLATION is so rich with ideas.  Here you're presented with two people who are alone forced to cling to each other for lack of anyone else.  In America would these two friends ever find each other?  Probably not, but here they are strangers in a strange land and all that makes a difference.
Bill Murray once again takes the smart road and distances himself from the films that made him a star.  He plays a character of such stunning vulnerability and yet silly charm.  I loved how he disappears into a scene.  You forget you're looking at the guy from MEATBALLS.  I sometimes miss the silly and crazy actor he once was, but at least when he turns in a dramatic performance it's well worth watching.
Johansson should also be congratulated for her fine performance.  I liked her understated charm and silly little smile.  The camera loves to linger on her because shes got this unique screen presence.  Of course she's beautiful, but not as a typical actress is beautiful.  She's beautiful like that girl in you're high school homeroom is beautiful, or that random women on the street is beautiful.  Johansson can exist in the real world.  She's average and yet mysterious, cute and yet understated.
All that aside the biggest problem with the movie is that much of the plot is half realized.  To make up for this Coppola trains her camera on Johansson as she a stare out windows, lays in bed, takes walk around Tokyo and then stares out the widow again.  A little of this is okay; it even worked sometimes.  I gave us a look inside her head.  But after we've figured out that she's lonely we keep watching her look out windows, and walk around.  It was too much and prolonged the meat of the movie, the relationship between her and Bob.
To the films credit there is a great sequence in which Bob and Charlotte are laying together in a bed.  You can tell they have a connection that sparks are flying, in a Hollywood movie this is the point that they'd begin to kiss.  But in this film Bob does something far more interesting he just touches her foot.  In real life you have to face the ones you love in the morning, Best not throw it all away on a person you hardly know.
TRANSLATION is about what connects people.  Is it a love story? Is it a story about friendship?  Is it a story about fidelity?  Is it about following your heart?  Yes and no, and maybe so.  Whats here is a compelling piece of filmmaking that dares you to do something we, as causal moviegoers, are seldom allowed to do.  It dares us to think.

1510623,5,B00005JMJ4,"How can I add to what so many have said?  The writing and directing is this film is authentic and brilliant.  The characters are beautifully brought to life by Scarlett and Bill, who fully deserve the critical praise they've already recieved.  This film is purely authentic.  These characters are real humans you feel like you know and understand on some level, regardless of what you think of them.  The journey is made up of what seems to be real life experiences, rather than contrived Hollywood fantasy.  This is the best film of 2003.
To clarify something, Sofia Coppola got funding for this film by pre-selling the distribution rights.  According to Filmmaker Magazine, Bill Murray did this for ""No Money"".  Whether that means scale or on deferrment I don't know.  What I do know is that people saying that Daddy Coppola is responsible for the funding or critical acclaim is just fantasy.  She did risky funding all on her own to ensure final cut, and I'm glad she did.
This is not a Hollywood movie, and the naysayers are clearly used to the latest romantic comedy which recycles the same formula over and over again.  This film is original and refreshing.  The ending is perfect.  It's a private moment left to the characters and your imagination.  This film demonstrates that chemistry, tension and attraction can happen without cheesy love scenes.

Much the same can be said for Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Her photographer hubby is running around Japan snapping rockers while she waits in the hotel room.
Bob and Charlotte happen across each other one day and suddenly their state of walking wounded has a buddy. Soon, they are spending every moment together. A friendship is bourne out of their loneliness and despiration.
While the movie seems to take itself too seriously at times. Probably due to writer/director Sofia Coppola being in love with her own vision. It manages to get through to us that these are good people who just need someone to understand them.
If you're expecting Bill Murray to mug for you, there is a little of it, but for the most part he is mannered and restrained as he should be given the material.",1065398400,,1018,4.629834254143646
1510625,2,B00005JMJ4,"I recognize that this review definitely represents a minority viewpoint regarding the merits of this film. I hope that it nevertheless will provide valuable insights to moviegoers whose tastes resemble my own, and that in addition it provides some counterbalance to those reviewers whose admiration for the obvious merits of this film causes them to gloss over what I regard as legimate criticisms.
I will begin by conceding the following positives. First, the concept animating the film has excellent potential and the title is indeed an accurate reflection of the concept behind the film. Second, the acting of the two leads is indeed excellent and their chemistry develops exactly as intended.. Third, the cinematography is also quite good. Fourth, there are several very clever moments and some truly enjoyable humorous incidents. Fifth and last, the movie captures some wonderful scenes of Tokyo and the aura it creates exactly mirrors all my totally uninformed preconceptions of what life in Tokyo is like for the upper classes. Thus, while I'm not at all sure that I would concede that Bill Murray's performance is of Academy Award potential as his admirers claim, it is certainly first rate and was one of the elements that provided some enjoyment in a film that I found tedious overall.
The idea (it does not really rise to the level of a plot) is simplicity itself. Bill Harris (Murray) arrives in Tokyo to be photographed for an advertising campaign, an aging celebrity who has agreed to endorse a line of alcoholic drinks in return for two million dollars. He doesn't understand the language so can't converse or watch televsion, is sleepless because of jet lag, has a translator who is of little help, and ends up whiling his late nights away in the hotel bar. Coincidentally Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is plagued by the same problems and winds up in the same bar while her husband, a photographer who she has accompanied on his shoot in Japan, ignores her to pursue his work and old friendships. Thus, in their isolation they gradually form a bond of friendship and participate in both the Tokyo nightlife and discussions of their situation. There is an undercurrent of attraction, as she is younger and definitely very easy to look at, while he provides some of the intellectual stimulation and attention completely lacking from her husband. While Bob feels further isolated by the very brief contacts that he has with his wife due to her busy routine (and exacerbated by the time differential between Tokyo and the United States), he still seems to be comfortable with his life and just waiting to finish his assignment, collect his enormous fee, and return home to resume his routine . Meanwhile Charlotte seems too young and too recently married to have any serious thoughts regarding her apparent lack of compatibility with her husband. Thus, their friendship remains exactly that, both perhaps wanting more but neither ready to translate their feelings into a serious discussion about themselves. It appears that not just foreign languages often lose something in translation.
Thus in the end, to mix metaphors, they are like two trains bound for nowhere simply passing in the night. This movie is an artistically excellent examination of some elements of the human condition but does not capitalize on its potential, perhaps it was LOST IN TRANSLATION. My reaction was the same as when viewing paintings by great artists that neither inspire or interest me. I may admire the technique and the technical brillance, but their totality leaves me unmoved. It seems to me that the only reason to watch this movie is for the existential experience of the viewing itself, and I found it too long and tedious and the subject matter of too little interest for the experience itself to be very worthwhile. There is no greater meaning or real story here. This is a movie that I will probably never want to watch again, although film clips of a few of the more memorable scenes would be quite enjoyable. Thus, I decided to round down my rating as a reflection of my personal reaction to the film, not as a reflection of its overall quality. If you like brilliantly directed and technically inteesting films, you will probably enjoy this. And if you are a Bill Murray fan it is defintely worth your time. But if you want a great plot and interesting story, there are plenty of better movies to attend.

1510626,4,B00005JMJ4,"It's rare when one movie is able to capture the essence of true lonliness and fellowship, but LOST IN TRANSLATION is such a film. Each one of us knows what it is like to be surrouned by many people, yet feel totally and utterlessly alone. At the same time, all of us also know what it is like to find true fellowship with someone; not the masked, skin-deep appearances that many mistake for friendship, but the true soul-connecting fellowship that alleviates the pain that lonliness leaves. That's part of what LOST IN TRANSLATION is about. It also has some other things to say: to truly enjoy life you have to know yourself; people can be friends without being lovers; and sometimes the smallest things in life are the most meaningful.
This is Bill Murray's finest performance to date and he'll probably get an Oscar nomination.
The movie is definitely not for everyone. It moves really slow, even in the ""fast"" scenes. Also, for a character driven film, there isn't much dialogue either. Instead, the characters are brought to life by what we see them do, which to be honest isn't much. However, what they actually do, is what many people actually do every day anyway. Here is a reality film that seems truly real. My only real complaint about the film was the unnecessary scene in the strip club; it doesn't add anything to the plot nor does it give the audience any deeper insight into the main characters. If it wasn't for that one scene, the movie probably would be PG-13 instead of R.
Overall, this is a movie not for the typical movie-goer. It's not the usual independent type of film either. Instead, it's a breed of a different kind and if your in the mood for something different, this maybe for what you're looking.",1065312000,5,1727,4.628664495114006

This is about two people who get each other in a world that doesn't.
After all, in a world where every male and female television leading character inevitably has sex with each other by the third season, this film is something new.
What do you call a profoundly intimate relationship between a man and woman, where both are married to other people, and they never have sex with each other? Is it an affair? A friendship? A flirtation?
It's something wonderfully more, and to label it any of these things is to lose something in the translation. That as much as anything else, might be the true meaning of the title.
Bill Murray plays a self aware actor in decline and Johannson plays a brilliant young woman who is both confident and unsure.

This film is about two lonely people in a world that's totally difficult for them to live in. They meet up at a bar, and run off for a night on the town. They develop a very special, strong friendship during the course of the week in Tokyo. The end is heartbreaking. You feel as if you know these people, and when the end comes along, well, I saw this with one of my best friends, and at the end of the film I grabbed her by the arm and gave her a big hug. I loved this film, and I will own it when it comes to DVD. THE BEST that 2003 has to offer. RUN to see it. Go now. RUN! Definitly should win all the major awards this year at the Oscars. Deserves them all.
HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SEE IT WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND.",1065312000,5,1169,4.086956521739131
1510763,5,B00005JMJ4,"I love character-based movies.  Love them.  In saying that, this movie blew me away.
It's about 2 Americans, stuck in Japan for different reasons, who feel trapped and out of place.  What begins as a trip they dread and hate transforms into something totally different as their friendship blossoms.
The directing is excellent, the script writing is clean, and the scenery is remarkable.  The places the characters visit are simply breathtaking; one scene coming to mind is a trip Scarlett Johansson takes to a temple where a Japanese wedding is taking place.  It's just gorgeous - it will truly blow your visual socks off.  What a beautiful country . . .
My advice?  See this.  It's funny and sad and poignant, and I can see why they say Bill Murray is Oscar material.  It's so real.  Five stars, all the way.  In my opinion, it's near perfect.",1065225600,,844,4.673469387755102
1510764,3,B00005JMJ4,"I came in with misgivings, having admired the craft but not enjoyed the Virgin Suicides. Quite and silence are used in film to add gravity to scenes (we're so used to constant soundtracks in American films), and I thought there was a lot of ill earned gravity to that movie. and honestly accounting for that, I still dislike Lost in Translation ... the entire first half consisted of one cheap shot after another to build up two characters who in the end I tolerate but generally think of arrogant tourists. Actually, I actively dislike the girl at the end. I understand that it was meant to show culture clash, the we're so lost and how do you reach out ... but with such a mean spirit that I couldn't help but think that of the shallow, low side of the characters. Nor did was it an elevation of what is basically a normal, common feeling for many of us. The culture clashes were so constructed as primarily sight gags, or reaction shots, or god forbid the japanese mispronouncing english...in Japan? It was a spirit that permeated the film, especially including the poor little rich girl actress. Sure its funny, the Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson (who did fine) are our surrogates, and they built entirely at the expense of the ill-concived characters, who are merelt more ""the world is crazy and crude"" props for the leads.
The second half was better, more even, even if the good things about Japan that they like are a very hip, elitist selection anyway. Had the first half been more tonally even, I think I would have enjoyed it much more. But by then I wanted the well made, well acted, pretty movie to end. Everyone was very good. The script was very
constructed, every other character astonishingly poor. Like Storytelling, well sure I don't like those people. You wrote them that way.
Happy Together reminds me of a lost in foreign country movie that wasn't so mean. Being lost shouldn't be a feeling that requires insults, like Coppola's shots w/o people. Simlarily, there are quiet banal moments we're just supposed to gauzily watch. I say we're suppose to feel a bit of their existential ennui. And I don't. Its the same thing as <SPOILER
mumbling the last words, and not giving it to the audience- cheap shot. Scenes that add the appearance of depth, but completely artificially.",1065225600,,2298,4.6905940594059405
1510765,4,B00005JMJ4,"""Lost in Translation"" is a film that conveys much of it's themes through silence. There are moments of awkward quietness between characters, and then there are moments of serenity expressed solely through the facial inflections of a woman's face. This is a very poetic movie in terms of presentation, but the content of it's message couldn't be more stark. Whether you're in Japan, or smack dab in the middle of metropolitan America, feelings of being alienated from a clear path are inevitable. ""Lost in Translation"" finds a kind of beauty in the strangeness of foreign lands, and foreign notions of what it truly means to be integrated into society.  Scarlett Johanssen and Bill Murray (in career-best peformances) play two strangers who inadvertantly cross paths, only to build an unspoken rapport that is fueled by equal parts of social desperation and emotional curiosity. The humor in this movie, at first, is targeted toward the flamboyancy of Japan's culture, but easy laughs fade as both Murray and Johanssen realize the stagnancy of their lives. Conversations between the two spark with a kind of honesty that is too often danced around. The initial disparity between Johansson's college-grad ambivalence and Murray's midlife apathy gradually dissolves as the bond strengthens, and the results are mesmerizing. ""Lost in Translation""'s comedy is a bit bumpy at times, and Sophia Copolla doesn't always burrow beneath the cliches of what Japanese people are like. But even with these faults, this is definitely one of the better films of 2003.",1065139200,3,1551,5.204
1510766,4,B00005JMJ4,this was an enjoyable film though i wish it had another screenwriter. there were some painfully sophmoric lines in the movie. but she really captured the dislocation of these people in Tokyo,1065139200,,190,4.96875
1510767,4,B00005JMJ4,"This film is Bill Murray's finest performance yet (coming in a close second: his run as the depressed middle aged husband/dad/businessman in ""Rushmore"").
Murray plays an aging 70s movie star who is flown to Japan to star in a series of commericals and ad campaigns for a Japanese whiskey.  His path intersects with that of Scarlett Johnson, who plays a lonely wife that is in Tokyo with her photographer boyfriend (Giovanni Ribisi) who leaves her alone all day then takes off completely for a few days while he is off shooting a rock band somewhere.  The beauty of this film is the way that Tokyo is portrayed by the director, Sofia Coppola, as well as the Murray and Johnson's reactions to the very foreign and seemingly bizarre world of Japan.
The film is funny is subtle ways: facial reactions, snippy comments from Murray, body language.  But the most beautiful part of the film is the way that Murray and Johnson find each other, and common ground, in a very surreal environment.  There is always underlying sexual tension, but that is the point and not the point at the same time.
At the end of the film, I was left wondering how often a person meets other people at inconvenient or strange times in both their lives and how those seemingly missed connections affect the rest of both people's lives, as well as the eternal question of ""what if?""",1065052800,8,1351,4.663865546218488
1510768,5,B00005JMJ4,"First I wondered why it was rated R.  After seeing the film, I still wonder.  There's precious little sex, only a little nudity, and no drugs or violence.  But don't be put off by the bogus MPAA rating... this film is excellent.
It's a complicate story of two people, generations apart, meeting in a very strange city. But what makes it such a great film is its so real. Bill Murray is superb, for the first time playing someone other than his SNL-character. The man has real acting chops, and he shows them here.
Its the strange nature of the friendship that his character develops with a younger girl that makes the film so good.  No, they don't sleep together. But when Bill does 'slip' and beds down with another woman, he's embarassed and his younger friend is hurt.
The ending is wonderful and takes a long time to sink in. But its worth seeing a couple of times to appreciate the nuance of the sound, the lighting and the effortless dialogue.
Great movie... but hardly worthy of the R rating.",1064880000,13,999,4.502762430939226
1510769,4,B00005JMJ4,"This movie is not for everyone.  It is slow, nothing much ever happens in it to be perfectly honest, but it's message comes across loud and clear and is beatifully conveyed.  To be perfectly honest I didn't recomend this movie to my friends, I told them they probably wouldn't like it, it's not their kind of movie, you have to be able to see the beauty in the message of lonliness that is slowly revealed throughout the movie.  I loved this movie and will buy it when it comes out on dvd and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I felt the pairing of Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson was a bit disturbing.  Both of them did a wonderful job and Sofia Copola was wise in keeping their relationship more plutonic than sexual (even though you can feel their attraction for one another).  If you like what you've read from all the good reviews of the movie then I'd say go out and see it, otherwise I'd say rent it when it comes out on dvd or go see something else.",1064880000,6,984,4.212765957446808
1510770,5,B00005JMJ4,"Simply beautiful. I'm at a loss for words to adequately describe this film. It's something that you must experience -- words alone can't do it justice. Lost in Translation is an intelligent film that requires audience participation and self-reflection to really appreciate its true value and meaning. Break out of the daze the latest Hollywood action/thriller/comedy/drama has left you in, watch this movie, exercise your brain and soul, and bite into a film with substance. Not everyone's going to ""get it"" but for those who do, this film is absolutely wonderful, full of meaning, comfort, and beauty.",1064793600,,602,5.216494845360825
1510771,4,B00005JMJ4,"Although there were some slow moments and seconds (of what seemed forever) of blank shots where the character would just be sitting down and staring out a window, I still enjoyed this film. It was nice to see Bill Murray on the big screen once again. His scenes with the Japanese were hilarious, and the lost and confused looks on his face were priceless. Scarlett Johansson is such a great actress compared to other young (and even older) actresses these days. The two play Americans, both in somewhat troubled marriages, and both sleepless in Japan who meet up one night (and the nights after) and establish a close, intimate relationship, minus the sex--so are they having an affair? Don't know. It shows how two people can be so close yet not have sex involved to make the ""relationship"" work. However, the ending is pretty sad. Murray and Johansson make a good on screen team and their actions toward each other seem so natural.
""Lost In Translation"" is a movie that you can relate to if you have travelled to a foreign country where everything around you was totally different from your usual lifestyle. I'd recommend this movie if you want to get away from those high budget movies that aren't even doing that well anyway, but don't expect too much cuz there are a couple parts where you will be ""lost in translation""... But hey, maybe that's the purpose?",1064707200,73,1362,4.702928870292887
1510881,3,B00005JMJ4,"That was the biggest revelation I got from this movie last night. When Murray's up on the big screen, you can see that here at least is someone in show biz who hasn't gone in for plastic surgery. Once one of his biggest early fans, I've missed a lot of Bill Murray's movies ever since losing my mind during the abyssmal ""Quick Change"" over ten years back. Interesting to revisit him after so much time has elapsed.
He's certainly the best thing in the movie. He has lots of sight gags and reaction shots to culture clash events that keep popping up as he goes to Tokyo on business to shoot some whiskey ads for $2 million. His character, movie star Bob Harris, is having trouble sleeping, so perhaps that's what makes him think about his current life in a somewhat negative vein.  He encounters in the hotel bar a years younger out-of-place housewife named Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johannson. The two find common ground in being two fish out of water, and spend the next week hanging out when they can.
So, I've said I liked Bill Murray again, after more years than I can count on my toes.
What didn't grab me?
1. Gratuitous opening shot of the backside of a reclining woman with see-through panties. The title of ""Lost in Translation"" comes on slowly over the undies. Where does this go? Nowhere, it's just to show you a butt through her underwear. Then we fade to the next scene. I'm surprised that this came from a woman director.
2. The Murray character eventually has a one-night stand with a cocktail lounge singer after an unpleasant call to his wife. One of the points the filmmaker wants to make is that Murray and Johannson can be friends without becoming lovers. So while these particular people can be friends without being lovers, this must be most unusual for a man, because if you give a man a week away from his wife, he'll fall into a bed with some woman, even if it's not the woman he likes best on his trip. Some message ultimately.
3. Not really enough ""going on"" in this movie. There must be thousands of shots of one or the other of them looking out a window at Tokyo or walking down a hallway. Enough already! Note to Sofia Coppola: there's more to ""writing"" a screenplay than just walking and staring! How's about some dialogue that advances the storyline to somewhere?
One final litmus test for this movie is that when the credits started to roll, I got up immediately. That usually never happens. But I was just so tired of sitting there that I just had to get out. In the end, Bill Murray was not enough to garner this film more than three stars.",1064707200,5,2578,4.473460721868365
1510882,5,B00005JMJ4,"For the past few years, I have been concerned that Bill Murray, who has long been one of my favorite performers, had been relegated by Hollywood exclusively to supporting parts.  After a string of wonderful box office films in the eighties and very early nineties, Murray had settled into playing largely supporting parts in a variety of smaller films, with Wes Anderson's RUSHMORE a major exception.  This film, however, is a return to leading man status for Murray, and he makes the most of a great part.
Murray plays American movie star Bob Harris, in Tokyo to make print and television ads for a Japanese brand of whiskey for $2 million.  We are simultaneously introduced to Charlotte, the young, intellectual, pretty, and profoundly disoriented wife of John, a freelance show business photographer in Japan to do a series of photo shoots.  Both are alienated from everything around them, unhappy in their marriages, unable to connect to the culture around them, and sleepless.  One night both of them go to the bar rather than lay in bed awake, and they instantly click on some level.  They spend the rest of their time together in Tokyo together (Charlotte's husband is out on an extended shoot), and they each discover in the other someone they enjoy, can confide in, and trust.  Is it a love affair?  A deep friendship?  The beauty of the film is that we don't know.  But we do get to witness two people, one famous and one unknown, one middle-aged and the other very young, connect on a very deep level.
Sofia Coppola has quickly established herself as a first rate director.  Luckily, having a father who owns his own studio should guarantee that she is able to continue making films.  Luckily, her talent as a director keeps this from being sheer nepotism.  I liked THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, but her success with LOST IN TRANSLATION shows that that film wasn't a fluke.
This is the best film featuring Tokyo that I have ever seen made by a non-native of Tokyo.  There is, of course, a wealth of great Japanese films featuring Tokyo, but these are all insider films, viewing Tokyo as they know it.  It is, for them, home.  But this film shows Tokyo as it appears from the outside, as it would appear to folks like me if they were to go there for the first time.
The film has one of the best, most satisfying, and completely ambiguous endings I have ever seen in any film.  The beautiful thing is that no one knows how it ends.  I'll not give any more away by saying more except to say that I don't think we, the viewers, are supposed to know how it ends.  Very beautifully done.
As far as the future goes for Bill Murray, he already is committed to do the voice for feline Garfield in the movie of the same name (as unwilling as I will be to see that one, it will probably be a big success at the box office) and will star in Wes Anderson's next film.  After this film and those, I think Murray will be back in a big way.",1064707200,15,2926,4.4849056603773585

1510884,4,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola has brought Bill Murray to a role that thoroughly establishes him as a gentleman, when he must leave his family of 25 years to come to Tokyo on business.  He is received in a style at the Park Hyatt hotel that befits his fame as Bob Harris the movie star, and now the spokesman for SunTory Whiskey.  At the same time he declares for the camera that ""It's SunTory Time"", he is something of a disconnected insomniac, pacing around the suite and looking for something authentic.  Well, it's not long before he crosses paths with Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, just out of college, and doing her best to be the wife of an itinerant photographer (Giovanni Ribisi, memorable from his recent role in ""Boiler Room"")).  It is as if ""men and women CAN be friends"", to rebut Billy Crystal in Nora Ephron's pairing with Meg Ryan in ""When Harry Met Sally"".  In this case, the sex part really doesn't get in the way.  We see what is perhaps a lampoon of some of the goofiness in the Japanese popular media, but Bob is game, and manages to crack a few unobtrusive jokes to keep the Bill Murray legacy alive and indeed perfected.  Charlotte is transfixed by Bob, and wonders if he is in a mid-life crisis (""Have you bought your Porsche yet?""), but Bob just appreciates finding a friend who'll really listen to him.  For those who loved the ineffable Bill, ever since he declared that ""that's the fact, Jack"" in ""Stripes"", this film is an incredible treat.  We're talking Best Actor, without a doubt, on par with Jack Nicholson's final emergence in ""As Good as it Gets"".  It is as if Charlotte has found a kindly comfort in this unusual mentor, who is fully willing to go to some decadent parties and off-color attractions in a camouflage T-shirt turned inside-out.  It is strange, in a way, how Ribisi fades from the scene; it's as if he doesn't really care.  But Bob would probably be the first to congratulate him, as a lucky man who doesn't know what it is to have such a wife.  As the professional critics tend to observe, there's not a whole lot of compelling ""story"" to lead you along through this 105 minutes; it is as if Coppola has instead prepared some sort of magic lantern show, in which the viewer is simply shown one context after another in a very ""polite"" set of circumstances.  This accounts for my 4-star rating.  Bob Harris, though, is enough to keep you in your seat, and Bill Murray now has a local capstone on his cinematic legend as great as the spire of the 52-story hotel from whose windows he is found staring.  But then, all folks go on, and we see, in the end, two folks who simply lived for their moments, before proceeding on, as their soul's assignments said they must.  In this case, the generation gap has been a functional aid to an encounter that would not so readily have happened otherwise.",1064448000,8,2825,4.5295275590551185
1510885,5,B00005JMJ4,"Have you ever just clicked with some complete stranger? By ""clicked,"" I don't necessarily mean in a romantic way. I mean, you go up to this person who looks troubled or smart or wise or fun, even though you don't know them. And for some reason, you're able to talk with this stranger. You talk about things that matter. You know where they are, what they're dealing with. And they talk to you like they know what you're going through and where you're going with it.
Maybe you were on vacation somewhere. Maybe it was a wrong number on a phone call. Maybe, just maybe, it was fate, giving you a hand and a person to lean on when you didn't quite know you needed it.
Now, you and this stranger share a couple enchanted moments, where it seems like someone who doesn't know you is the only one who can hear you. And when the talk ends or the enchanted time with this stranger passes, you're somehow the better for it, even though nothing particularly substantial happened.
Fate reminds you that you're not alone, and fate reminds you of the sort of wonderful person you really are, outside of all the day-to-day drama of your life or away from the minutae that surrounds your everyday existence.
In Sofia Coppolla's LOST IN TRANSLATION, two strangers, Bob and Charlotte, share that kind of connection when they both end up in a Tokyo hotel, where they don't fit in with the world around them and don't seem to belong anywhere. So they come together.
What they share is not quite a romantic love, but it is a romance. Their friendship provides them with solace, with enchanted moments. Their chats give them both the strength and the tools to deal with their real lives. They're strangers to one another, who may only know each other a week, but they understand each other at a time when both of them needed to be seen for who they were and understood.
Bob's an actor in Tokyo doing a commercial and taking a break from his exasperated wife. Charlotte's accompanying her photographer husband on a business trip - even though he leaves her alone for most of the time - because she didn't have anything better to do back home. She's in the process of discovering her identity. He's in the process of rediscovering who he is in the midst of the life he's grown tired of leading.
And they help each other.
This film is completely charming and very mature, having its characters understand and explore some fundamental aspects of human nature and identity. The film is also very funny, exploring a clash of cultures and examining the weirdness of how you can sometimes get to the heart of who you are when you're away from everything you're familiar with.
The acting, particularly from the leads, is excellent. Scarlett Johansson's character is so fully realized that you want to hug her, and Bill Murray gives the best performance of his career. The film is beautiful to look at. The story's wonderful and smart, and the script is amusing yet serious.
LOST IN TRANSLATION helps you feel better about yourself. It reminds you that there are people out there just like you, who know who you really are and where you're going.

perfect.  It may not cover ethical issues, it is not outrageous or controversial...it is one of the most beautiful love stories ever. It is simple. It is perfect.
The story is about two lonely people, in a place they don't connect with, with people they don't connect with. Bill Murray plays an actor past his prime who is in Japan making some cash by doing whisky adds. He is married, has kids, and forgets their birthdays. His wife does not say ""I Love You"" before she hangs up the phone when he calls her. He spends his sleepless nights hagning out in the bar of his over the top modern Japanese hotel having a drink.
Scarlette Johanson plays Charlotte, she is married to a self-absorbed photographer who always leaves her alone in the over the top modern Japanese hotel.  She spends her sleepless nights hanging out in the bar having a drink, and staring out the window at the city of lights (I mean LOTS of lights, Tokyo puts Las Vegas to shame when it comes to lights).
These two lost souls meet and form an unlikely friend/love bond. This is not a lustful bond on either of their parts. Their love is love in the truest sense of the word, pure and real.
When I said this movie had 3 amazing talents, well the other would have to be Soffia Coppola. Following her indie success with ""The Virgin Suicides"" which I highly recommend, she brings out a more adult, sophistocated movie.
This movie is also VERY funny, but in a very subtle way. Bill Murray is marvelous, so natural. The humor is based on our misunderstandings of the Japanese culture, and their misunderstandings about ours.
Look for oscar nominations for this one. It blows all the competition away for movies this year.",1064275200,6,1746,4.5396825396825395
1510887,5,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" is a delicate, well-acted, visually astonishing film about the dislocation of being alone in a foreign culture and the desperate need for human connection. At the heart of the story is the brief encounter between Bob, a middle-aged movie star in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial, and Charlotte, a bored young wife left alone in Tokyo by her self-centered, workaholic photographer husband. Both are adrift and without moorings in a society where virtually nothing is familiar or reassuring--except, as it develops, each other. The film is essentially a string of vignettes, without much in the way of a narrative line, and the story--such as it is--loses momentum in the last half-hour. But that doesn't matter much, thanks to the quiet, delicately nuanced performances of Bill Murray as Bob and Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte. Murray, especially, is revelatory: his face in middle age has taken on some of the craggy gravitas of Robert Mitchum and Johnny Cash, and the wounded, melancholy look in his eyes haunts you long after the movie has ended. This is not to say that Murray doesn't give us some laughs; there are bits of business here as funny as anything he has ever done. (Chief among them are Murray's collision with a runaway exercise machine; his embarrassed encounter with a clownish talk-show host; and his martyrdom at the hands of an uninvited Japanese dominatrix who orders him to ""lip"" her stockings.) But it is the poignant near-romance between Murray and Johansson that you will remember, as well as the stunning photography by Lance Acord, presenting Tokyo as a cross between Las Vegas and the Brave New World.",1064188800,18,1672,5.03971119133574

This is a wonderful, beautiful, perfect movie.  Directed by Sofie Coppola, two americans, one Bill Murray as an aging american movie star, the other (played by a newcomer named Scarlett Johansen), a young Harvard philosophy grad who has mistakenly hooked up with an american fashion photog husband.  Two lost souls, they gradually form a bond during a week stuck in a hotel in Tokyo, which is apparently a city that includes huge, beautiful, peaceful places as well as unbelievably claustrophobic, technology riddled entertainment opportunities, so you get both the lovely buddhist visuals and the visual overload type stuff from the same movie.  There's hysterical Bill Murray stuff too, but that's not the whole point, just a very entertaining extra, and there are lovely references to other parts of Murray's career, which resonate like the scene of Travolta dancing in Pulp Fiction.

So what could this perfect movie to me possibly be about? Well it stars Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson as two people who are kinda going through a rough patch in their life, and they meet each other in Tokyo and a friendship grows between them. It doesn't sound like the plot to a perfect movie, but you have to see it! I love everything about it. I love the setting, I am a sucker for Japan, I absolutely adore it and it looks so beautiful in this movie. I love the characters, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are phenomenal in this movie, their dialogue feels real and genuine, they have fantastic chemistry together and I have never seen a bond like theirs in any movie. The music, I need to own this soundtrack. It's just too damn good! I have seen this movie several times, I can't find one thing wrong with it. Even these two annoying and quite frankly idiotic characters who I despise, they don't take away from the movie. They are there for a reason, which is to make us sympathize and love our main characters even more. You are with them all the way and you just love watching them. It feels like you are on this little journey with them, just hanging out in Tokyo and having a blast. I do not ever want this movie to end, and it breaks my heart when it does, cause I love every minute of it. Now I am going to make this clear, Lost In Translation is not my favorite movie of all time, that title belongs to Star Wars. But even I can't say that Star Wars is a perfect movie, but this is, at least to me it is. I mean I could go on forever about how this movie is amazing, but I am going to let you judge that for yourself. I don't care if you buy it, rent it, I don't care how you see it, just see it. It is worth your time and it is only barely over an hour and a half long, so it's not too long even though I wish it was like three hours long.",1526256000,,1988,4.01007556675063

7939960,4,B00005JMJ4,"Sofia Coppola defines her style with Lost in Translation.

Sofia Coppola finds her own unique style of film making with her 2003 movie Lost in Translation. Every scene is beautifully shot with zoomed out establishing shots like the masters. Coppola loves tender close up shots that endear you to her characters and show so much emotion without anything spoken. Her panning shots stick to the actors and let us follow them around while they try to enjoy themselves in Japan.

Lost in Translation is a quiet blissful trip to Japan that takes the audience all around Tokyo. We get to see Japanese hotels, bars, restaurants, temples, clubs, karaoke joints, hospitals, strip clubs, and plenty more local spots. It's a cute look into another culture. Sofia Coppola captures another culture with a cool style all her own.

Bill Murray is at his best in Lost in Translation. He's a middle aged married man that appears miserable in Japan. Murray acts out his finest performance as the confused tourist and actor struggling to find enjoyment away from home. He's very funny and will keep you entertained by his quips.

Additionally, Murray expands his acting range into the dramatic during Lost in Translation as he must also depict a forlorn man out of his element. Murray plays the sad mope well so much so you'll think he is not actually having a good time. I think Lost in Translation prevails as one of the greatest films Bill Murray has ever been apart of to date.

The star of Lost in Translation is Scarlett Johansson as she plays the young wife to Giovanni Ribisi's character John. Ribisi is perfect as the negligent new husband that does not find interest in sweet wife. Ribisi plays the aloof photographer John that completely ignores Johansson's charming character Charlotte. Johansson depicts dejection quite well as she is clearly bored and uncertain about her feelings for her husband. Scarlett Johansson demonstrates she can act convincingly as Lost in Translation is arguably her finest role.

Overall, Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is worth a watch. You'll laugh and relate to these characters that Coppola wrote so well. They feel so natural in their actions and feelings that you are sure to empathize with their emotions. Give it a chance!",1524009600,,2257,4.941952506596306
