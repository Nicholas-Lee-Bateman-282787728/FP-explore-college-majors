8388645,4,B00353W2NW,"A terrible accident in the Canadian wilderness, turns a fun trip down the river into a grim life threatening situation for four teenage girls, in Surviving Crooked Lake (2008).  This is the debut for the filmmaking team of Sascha Drews, Matthew Miller, and Ezra Krybus, who combined to write the screenplay, and direct the movie.  The principal cast numbers five.  The four teenage girls are participating in their first film, and use their real first names in the movie.  Reported made for only $30,000, the film isn't the most polished, but it does tell its story fairly effectively, and in a very natural way.  Spoilers follow, so read on as you will.

Four teenage friends, Candice (Candice Mausner), Morgan (Morgan McCunn), Alysha (Alysha Aubin), and Steph (Stephannie Richardson), embark on a trip down a river in two canoes.  The girls are not skilled campers, but with them as a guide, is Steph's older brother Jonah (Guy Yarkoni), who is very experienced in taking people down the river.  Things start off well, as the group travel downriver before stopping for an afternoon of swimming, smoking, and relaxation.  It seems that something may be happening between Morgan and Jonah, but what, is not revealed.  An incident around the campfire causes Morgan to run off into the woods, and Jonah follows to bring her back.  Unfortunately, in the darkness he trips and falls on a tree trunk, and is severely injured.

In a panic, the girls take Jonah back to their camp, patch his wounds as best they can, and load him into one of the canoes.  Steph and Candice head off into the darkness, trying to reach some kind of help, leaving Alysha and Morgan to follow as best they can.  Unfortunately Jonah's wounds are severe, and he dies during the night.  Morning comes, and the girls pull the boats to shore, consult a map, and decide to try and walk to safety.  After some heated discussion, the group wraps up Jonah's body in a sleeping bag, and carry it in a makeshift stretcher.  Experiencing great difficulties carrying the body through the wilderness, they are forced to return to the river, towing Jonah's body in the second canoe, and looking for any kind of help.

Some of what happens is completely implausible, as carrying a body through the forest would be a challenge even for grown men.  The girls manage to get by with hardly any food, and amazingly manage not to injure themselves.  Still, if you can overlook some of the practical concerns, and focus on the interactions between the girls, the film has much to offer.  The teens change under stress, and the struggle to stay alive, tests the bonds of their friendship, and eventually separates them.  Steph is literally trying to hang on to her brother, even challenging wolves who are attracted to the decaying body.

With much of the dialog improvised, the performances of the four young actresses, comes across as very natural.  The results are quite remarkable and often captivating.  Combine these acting performances, with some unusual editing, featuring creative handheld camerawork, tightly framed close-ups, and strange out of focus shots, and you have a film that has a unique look, with a kind of ""you are there"" realism.  With ambitious goals of telling a coming of age story, but limited by a meager budget, the film's low key conclusion may not bowl you over, but it seems to fit the situation.

The DVD has a commentary track with directors Krybus, Drews, and Miller, that helps provide a better understanding of this interesting and compelling film.  An informative making of featurette, reveals some details regarding just how low budget a production this was, shot on location with a skeleton crew.  There are also interviews with the three directors and the principal cast.  Showing young girls reacting in a survival situation, is something that almost everyone involved with Surviving Crooked Lake, mentions as an important achievement.  While perhaps not completely realistic or very polished, the effort certainly came from a good place, and the naturalistic acting performances are strong, and quite refreshing.",1316390400,2,4103,4.954678362573099

First of all this is in no way a thriller, teen scream or even suspenseful.  It's a psychological drama at best. It's a survival movie about four girls who have no common sense or sense of direction.

The camera work is atrocious, it's often fuzzy and out of focus.  There are also an insane amount of super close-ups which was distracting when the lead actress (Steph) needed an eyebrow wax in the worst way.

The acting swings from horrible to not that bad.  Sometimes it felt like they were just reading lines other times you could almost sense some real emotion. The director really should have pushed them harder.  All the girls look alike, especially in the beginning so it is hard to tell them apart at first.

I really sympathized with Steph not wanting to leave her brother behind.  I wouldn't want to leave a loved one behind like that either.  What I didn't understand was how these girls could get so lost on a lake and why they didn't just leave Steph with her brother and come back  with help immediately instead of desecrating the poor man's body all over the woods.

After all the agonizing, Steph has some hallucinations and then decides to bury her brother and brave the water?  Weak ending.

I managed to watch this all the way through and it even made me yell at the T.V. a bit (seriously, why didn't Steph kill Morgan?  It was TOTALLY that sk*nk's fault!) so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars.",1312243200,2,1431,4.517509727626459
