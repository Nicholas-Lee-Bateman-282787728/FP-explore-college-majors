1396924,4,B000056EW8,This movie would have been a bore if it weren't for sex pot Jodi Lyn O'keefe. This movie had her in many tight outfits :) She is also a fine actress. Rent it buy it just for her.,1036281600,3,178,3.710526315789474

1396926,1,B000056EW8,"I mean, come on, she had to have.  I haven't seen a performance this pitiful since Renee Zwelieger starred in the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  She is just no Rose McGowan.  The girl's anger and hurt is reminiscent of the anger and hurt shown by an actress in a Midol commercial.  As a matter of fact, that is probably the only thing she is capable of doing--advertising for Midol or Preparation H.  See this film if you really feel the need to scratch your eyes out.",1020643200,4,467,4.383720930232558
1396927,4,B000056EW8,"This movie is scary, suspensful and flat out entertaining. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe in the lead role as a confused, victimized (yet capable of victimizing others) and brutal young woman is superb. Ms. O'Keefe is a strong and capable actor.

This movie is well made, nicely casted, acted and directed.",1015459200,,292,4.959183673469388
1396928,5,B000056EW8,"I watched the first Devil In The Flesh thinking no actress could play Debbie Strong as good as Rose Mcgowan but Jodi Lyn O'Keefe did an awesome job. The movie starts when Debbie escapes from a mental hospital and steals the identity of a very rich girl who just into college. The movie follows Debbie as she falls in love and murders anyone who gets in her way. Jodi is a wonderful actress and I would recomend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies, comedy movies, or any fan of Jodi. This is a great movie.",994464000,6,514,4.309278350515464
1396929,4,B000056EW8,"OK if you saw the first movie there really isn't any new plot twists, it's pretty much a rehash of part 1. The only real difference here is that the main character from the original, Debbie Strong (played by the amazing Rose McGowan) is now played by Jodi Lynn O'Keefe. In this movie Debbie escapes from a mental hospital and under a false identity attends college and develops another obsessive crush on a professor. When things don't go Debbie's way, the body count starts to pile up. Like I said earlier this movie is almost identical to the first one. But the real surprise here is Jodi. Although Rose McGowan is missed, Jodi pulls off an amazing performance and is so fun to watch that you will forgive the producers for making this movie without Rose. I've seen Jodi in teen films like She's All That and Whatever it Takes but in this film she really shows off her acting ability and she has more screen time than in her other films like Halloween: H20 and The Crow:Salvation. So to sum it up if your a fan of Jodi Lynn you should check it out. If you want an original thriller you might be disappointed.",992822400,8,1110,4.419512195121952

1396941,5,B000056EW8,"I love this movie it's so evil but well done and well acted. It's crazy because part 2 is actually better than part 1 and that's saying something since Rose McGowan did a damn good job in that movie. I felt like Rose carried part 1 but part 2 was the better overall movie and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is a believable monster and much more seductive as she really took Debbie Strong to the next level.

The Devil in the Flesh movies are underrated and they are some of the most evil movies I've ever seen in my life. I'm really shocked the third one hasn't been made yet. If this series ever gets restarted or rebooted then I would hope that they can keep the same Debbie for the sequel(s) because that's my main criticisms in these movies as they were lucky to have two great actresses play the parts but we need some consistency.

Overall great movie especially for a sequel that I would recommend to anybody that likes these kind of thrillers about crazy young women.",1410998400,,961,4.363128491620111

1396943,3,B000056EW8,"Devil in the Flesh II is probably going to lead to Devil in the Flesh III. Really shouldn't do this. Kill the bitch and get it over with. But she just keeps killing and killing. The storyline leaves a lot to be desired. The acting is okay. The directing, again okay. Nothing here to write home to momma about. I am bored with the mad person breaking out of an asylum and going on a killing spree by stealing somebody's identity. Next she will probably be steal a 30 something mother, killing the wife of 3 kids, and then take her place and nobody will notice the difference. Slim chances of this being reality but wtf, it's only a movie.",1410220800,,637,4.316666666666666

1396950,4,B000056EW8,"Devil in the Flesh is a good low budget flick produced by Richard Brandes and Kurt Anderson working on a Steve Cohen effort.  It stars Rose mcGowan as Debbie Strand: an abused child who secretly kills her mother in a fire and is taken by her social worker (julia Nickson)to live with her grandmother Fiona (Peg Shirley).  Hats off to Peg for an effective portrayal of such a foul bat. Fiona sets the tone for the movie.  Debbie has a calm demeanor and is a real hottie.  But inside she is a very disturbed sociopath capable of homicide at any moment. Fiona is a cruel old granny who bullies Debbie all over the house.  Fiona is a staggering incompetent as a guardian for Debbie who is nearly a woman. ""Devil in the Flesh"" is a lousy name for this film.  It sounds like a T-rex having lunch not a story about a troubled young woman.  Call it ""The Abused"" or something.  Anyway, Rose is really a competent actor as well as a looker and she plays Debbie with a kind of poise backlit by a keg of rage.  Early in the movie there is some sympathy for Debbie and her darkly funny executions are just a wee bit appealing: including yapping mutt, awful granny, and obnoxious jock.  The film seems to slam every male in the area code, and their treatment of newcomer Debbie, with the exception of charming, likeable Peter (Alex MacArthur).  Debbie gets carried away by Peter, the only nice man around.  See what happens.  The movie changes tone when the likable Anna (Julia Nickson) appears for a visit.  I remember her as Harold's wife in the movie K2. Anna tries to help Debbie when she appears to have facial bruises.  Anna gets her skull cracked instead.
Not Funny.  Anyway, a good story with good acting. GJ

Devil in the Flesh 2; Produced by Richard Brandes.  Jodi Lyn O'Keefe whom I've never heard of stars as Debbie Strong and does a remarkable job as a mentally ill young woman.  Strong breaks out of a prison for the criminally insane, takes part in a fatal fall by a woman named Tracy Carley.  Debbie steals her identity and becomes Tracy (they look very much alike) and completely vanishes as somebody else.  Strong is pretty and evil at the same time.  She wears tight clothing and has a half smile that is secret and selfish.  She is tall and willowy and is very youthful.  This sequel differs from the first film and in some ways character development is better. Strong feels pain.  She cries, grieves, and suffers.  Srong takes some abuse from her resident adviser, and from the rejection of lover Sam her creative writing teacher.  This one is well worth watching.  GJ

Interlocked: Produced by Richard Brandes, written by Al Sophianopoulos.  This movie doesn't belong on the same ticket as the other two in my opinion.  The movie improves to those who hang in there.  However when the plot finally forms it is completely trite.  The sex scenes are much to long, as are the dance wriggles.  Also, the actors don't seem to fit their roles.  Poorly picked cast.

1396951,3,B000056EW8,"I honestly liked the stories of the first two movies (Devil in the Flesh 1 and 2). I was a bit turned off from the nudity in 2 though. I had never seen Interlocked before and had just let that one play to see what it was about and never got farther than the first scene. It was just like watching a porn flick. Very not cool. Lifetime had shown the first two (D1 and D2) and certainly cut a lot of the nudity out. A bit is tolerable, but too much is just raunchy. On lifetime though I enjoyed the first two on here.",1381881600,,515,3.914285714285714

1396953,1,B000056EW8,This was a very cheaply made movie and its sequel. I like rose McGowan as an actress very much but all of her costar s were terrible actors and actresses. It reminded me of a cheap porn. I was very disappointed. In the sequel it was a total different actress but suppose to be Debbie who rose McGowan played in the first. She didn't portray the same character at all. I wouldn't recommend  either one to watch.,1365465600,,410,4.324675324675325

1396955,1,B000056EW8,"Caught this film on HBO the other night, I'd never heard of JL O'Keefe.  DAMN is she hot...I was blown away by her beauty.  She's an ok actress that didn't really portray menace and anger all that well.  But hey, I'm a guy...I'm thinking about dropping $10 on this just to check O'Keefe out again.

To summarize:

movie: WEAK (see other reviews for detail)

O'Keefe: Incredibly Hot Babe (she should star in some better roles)",1106265600,,425,4.6
1396956,2,B000056EW8,"THIS TIME, DEBBIE STRONG [THIS TIME, BEING PLAYED BY JODI LYNN O KEEFE] BECOMES OBSESSED WITH A COLLEGE TEACHER. MOVIE'S QUITE OK TO WATCH SOMETIMES, BUT, I CAN'T DENY THE FACT THAT I DON'T LIKE THIS NEW GIRL. I REALLY THINK ROSE MCGOWAN DONE BETTER AND IF YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE IN ITS ENTIRETY, YOU'LL SEE WHY. BUT, AT LEAST IT WAS REMOTELY ENTERTAINING. I THINK IT'S AT LEAST WORTH 1 RENTAL. NOTHING MORE.",1089763200,,406,4.5
1396957,4,B000056EW8,"I didn't even know there was a sequel to Devil In The Flesh (which I own on DVD) until I was at the video store recently in the thriller section and spotted it. I looked at it and rented it just because if I have seen and liked an original if there is a sequel I have to see it. But there has been several sequel disasters (ex: the prequel to the hilarious movie dumb and dumber called dumb and dumberer, the most stupid movie I have ever seen and an insult and embarrassment to the first I love all kinds of movies) and plus I tend to be skeptical when a movie is from a company I haven't heard of and the sequel is a different main character than the first cause it makes it less believeable.
But I was familar with Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and thought it didn't look that bad so I rented it anyways. I was pleasantly suprised I thought I may think it was okay but I didn't expect to like it a lot more than the original.
Although I like Rose Mcgowen who played the same part in the first movie and thought she did with it, I actually liked Jodi Lyn O'Keefe's portrayal of it better. I find her more attractive than Rose and more believeable bitc*y than her as well. She also has a much better taste in clothes than Rose does but all of this doesn't make for a good actress. Which I was delighted to find she actually is a good actress although she doesn't really get the chance to prove it since Jodi always gets stuck with the beautiful but bitc*y roles (ex: She's All That, Whatever It Takes) but in this one she's not really bitc*y just decieving.
Jodi plays Debbie Strong who escapes from the mental instution she was sent when she murdered her mother grandmother and attempted to murder her obbsessive crush on her english teacher in the original. She also murdered several others in the original including her best friend and a boy from school who had the hots for her. She escapes and steals the car, money and idenity of a girl she met by in a way hitchhiking. The girl was really rich and realuclantly off to college but was very dopey. Deb doesn't even have to murder her before she can she accedently murders herself.
Her original plan was to take her intuition money and go to mexico and be crazy but while getting the money she runs into An english Professor at the college Mr. Deckard (who is so much cuter than the guy she was obbsessed with in the first movie and he takes it much farther than the other guy did) and immeditely becomes smitten so she decides to go to the college instead of mexico.
She meets and effects several people besides Mr. Deckard including her geeky inexperienced roomate Laney, a total jock jerk who even though Deb constantly embarrasses him in front of his friends and mouths off to him he won't take no for an answer (just like the jerky jock that wouldn't take no for an answer in the first one. Also note that they look alike except in my opinion this one is uglier and more stupid than the other guy) and lots of other people.
As the movie progresses Debbie gets more obbsessed more insane and more dangerous. When Debbies roomy and new best friend leaks on to her disturbing past she's a goner. When the RA of the floor takes her mouthing off to far guess what she's a goner. When a drunk won't leave her alone guess what he's a goner. The number of bodies count up through the movie. When she really gets insane is when she fills Sam up with too much wine and the two end up getting hot and heavy in his office. When he suddenly feels guilty about his actions he of course breaks it off and that is when her character becomes dangerously obbsessed. Again like the original, the teacher has a blonde girlfriend who has had problems with the relationship. When his girlfriend becomes pregnat and she spys on the two also getting hot and heavy in his office that is when she goes after the girlfriend just like the character did in the original.
All in all this movie has funny moments, creepy moments, dramatic moments, etc. etc. I didn't find it scary and I don't see why it was in the thriller section it could be labeled more of a drama than a thriller at least to me (but also note it takes a great deal to scare me) but it is an amusing movie and worth taking a look at. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe steals the movie and I wish she was given more main parts in movies.",1082332800,6,4305,4.276960784313726
1396958,5,B000056EW8,"Anyone who suggests that better acting could have made this a better movie is taking the film far too seriously.  Come on, this movie is a joke.  It can barely be classified as a horror film.  Not that thats a bad thing, this is a great movie, but its only a great movie if its taken lightly.
I mean really, there are only two cops in the entire town, and they happen to be father and son?  I'm supposed to take this seriously, and consider it, and rate it, as a serious film?  Give me a break.
Although, this movie had made a major contribution to film.  The board with the nail death scene (anyone who has seen the film knows what I'm talking about) was ""borrowed"" for the movie, Kill Bill vol. 1.  So I guess that gives the movie some credablity.
Whatever.  Enjoy the movie, but don't take it to seriously.  If you try to critique movies, and point out their faults, thats when moviegoing becomes a drag.",1070841600,4,907,4.288235294117647
1396959,1,B000056EW8,"This film is in need of an actress like Maruschka Detmers (who starred in the 1986 Italian version).  While the Italian version was far from a great film, Detmers gave the uninhibited, feral sexual-predator performance needed to drive the concept.  In Devil in the Flesh 2, what we get is the American homogenized version:  A bad campus soap opera desperately trying to be an erotic thriller.  And when you marry the worst elements of Felicity with Poison Ivy, expect the worst.
And you get the worst.  She may be good-looking, but Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is unable to project real threat and sensuality:  Her over-the-top makeup job doesn't help and in fact makes her look like a mockery, a parody of a dangerous woman.  And you can literally see her actors' contract pass through your eyes when you hit the sex scenes (""No nudity...no nudity...""), where director Marcus Spiegel whips out all the worst cliches:  Airy music, dissolves, body doubles with their heads cut off, and...oh!  Those painful stop-motion slow-mo shots!  If a soft-core stripper video is what they wanted, they certainly succeeded.  This character is supposed to be the sexy, uninhibited, dangerous woman who shakes up everybody's world, and the obvious fakeness of the sex scenes just destroys her credibility.  At least try to hide the body double, folks!
The directing and editing are just miserable, with the death-by-phone-wire scene being especially laughable.  Shoot it three times from similar angles and use all of them -- great way to make the audience notice the stunt woman!  I know this film was made for cable, but did they have to flaunt the low production values and bad taste at every turn?
A flick deserving of the utmost contempt and ridicule.",1060732800,7,1729,4.937716262975779
