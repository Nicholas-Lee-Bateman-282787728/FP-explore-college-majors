2920193,5,B000UC33NO,"I had heard about Donovan's LA concert on PBS, but missed the broadcast at the time, and I was therefore anxiously awaiting the package from Amazon when the DVD finally was released in January this year.

Was it worth the wait? For me, the answer is a definite yes. Donovan's music is a pleasant memory of growing up for me, and I have always liked his simple style and of course his poetry - minimal fuss with a powerful message. This concert captures the essence of Donovan surprisingly well in my opinion, given the relatively simple stage setting and choreography. Just him, a bass player and a percussionist, creating excellent sounds throughout the evening. His voice sounds like it is still 1964, and his guitar playing throughout is a real highlight for me. The video and sound are both top quality.

The set list contains mostly well-known hits, with a few lesser-known songs in the mix. I was somewhat underwhelmed by the appearances of his daughter and, in one instance, former Beach Boy Mike Love - nothing spectacular there. But for the most part, just the man, his guitar and backup musicians kept me and the audience in the Kodak theater spellbound, for sure.  Personal favorites are Try for the Sun, Young Girl Blues and Lalena - wow, can this guy play guitar and sing!

All in all, a great concert that I'll be sure to enjoy over and over.",1201824000,28,1356,4.6375
2920194,4,B000UC33NO,The DVD met all my expectations. Love the songs of the 60s & 70s. Would recommend it as historic in nature.,1362960000,,107,4.142857142857143
2920195,5,B000UC33NO,"Recorded for a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation, this has to be the first full-length Donovan concert to be filmed officially. It starts with a brief overview of his career (including ""Wear Your Love Like Heaven"" and ""Atlantis"" both which are not included in the show) But Donovan does all his greatest hits, tells stories of his travels with Gypsy Dave and going to India with the Beatles.
Among the highlights are a sing along with the audience on ""Happiness Runs"" and a song by his daughter Astrella Celeste. Mike Love the Beach Boy who came to India with him in '68 joins Donovan and Astrella for an encore of ""Mellow Yellow"" (""What's my name again?""...)",1269216000,2,672,4.703389830508475
2920196,1,B000UC33NO,"It states on the write up that this dvd is playable in all Regions. I purchased one plus amazon sent another one at no charge and neither of them played. When you insert the dvd it states: ""not playable in this region."" I have sent them both back.",1248739200,,247,4.166666666666667
2920197,3,B000UC33NO,"Hope, dope, running down the slippery slope.  Reds, pinks, lavenders and all the colors of the progressive political and social rainbow. Mini skirts, maxi skirts, jeans, denim jackets, floppy hats and make your own wardrobe from the Salvation Army remnants. Do your own things, chill out, make up your own identity (or identities). Try scream therapy, water therapy, thermal therapy, transcendental mediation, floatation mediation. You name it somebody tried it. Okay, enough of the memories. Of course from some of the previous writings of this reviewer in this space the descriptions above could only describe the 1960's, the time of his youth- the time of the ""Generation of `68"". And the artist under review, my contemporary, the singing/songwriter Donavan was in the thick of it. In those days he threw his hat in the ring as one of the talented musicians who was trying to find a ""different way"", musically and spiritually, from that of our parent' generation. In those days he traveled in some fast musical company, including the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell.

But that was then and now the 60-something is playing the old favorites, in the documentary under review, in Los Angeles in a benefit concert for movie director David Lynch's meditation center. That purpose is somewhat symbolic because the performance here, while adequate, gave me the impression that he was meditating in public. Although the audience, when scanned, seemed to like his performance there was something missing that could not be salvaged even with cameo appearances by his daughter and the Beach Boys Mike Love (on the encore ""Mellow Yellow""). I saw Donovan live in Boston, as he started to tour again, a couple of years or so before this filming and he was on fire then. So, maybe it is the hardships of touring that has taken its toll. Let's put it this way, this performance rates three stars. I am also reviewing a CD compilation of Donavan's early work, something of a greatest hits production, entitled ""Sunshine Superman"". That collection rates five stars. Something about the vagaries and ravages of aging is definitely at play here. Oh, well. If you have only one choice get the CD.

That said, those who choose the film will get a full cycle of Donovan's early work, including ""Colors"" and ""Catch The Wind"" (recently used in an automobile commercial- not good) that first brought Donovan's work to my attention. ""Jennifer Juniper"", ""Mellow Yellow"" (as an encore), ""The Universal Soldier"" and ""Sunshine Superman"" are also included. Just listing his songs here evokes a whole youth of color, change, causes and clashes. Ah, those were the days.",1239926400,8,2644,5.018223234624146
2920198,4,B000UC33NO,This Dvd is well worth the price. Donovan still is a charismatic entertainer with some great stories to tell. It is refreshing to hear all of these wonderful songs played again. Donovan's guitar has never sounded better and while the years have deepened his voice he still maintains a high level of vocal delivery which all Donovan fans have come to expect.,1238371200,2,357,4.774193548387097
2920199,5,B000UC33NO,"Donovan still has the majestic persona that he had in the sixty's. His years of transcendental meditation have certainly embellished his personality in a way that envisages a feeling of a person that is obviously content with his existence. This is a ""Must Have"" for Donovan fans, and ""Should Have"" for the younger crowd that wants to understand the feelings of inner peace discovered in the 60's.",1212796800,4,397,4.940298507462686
2920200,5,B000UC33NO,"Enjoyable performance 40 years after his prime.  Almost all of his biggest hits are performed during this show.  I noted the absence of two of my favorites - Wear Your Love Like Heaven and Season of the Witch.  But, nonetheless, it is worth your time if you are a fan.",1207612800,,268,4.32
2920201,4,B000UC33NO,"I love Donovan-- going back to 1965, when my very first single that I bought was ""Catch the Wind."" I have also bought a number of his albums and ""Greatest Hits"" compilations. About two years ago, my friends and I went to Torrington's Warner Theatre to see him play live (on the same bill as Roger McGuinn of the Byrds!!!).

  Anyway,I received my copy of Donovan's DVD and ran to my DVD player to watch it. The concert was, on the whole, very good. BUT, I was a little disappointed in Donovan's VOICE. It may well be that he had some problems that one night in January, 2007. But, for the first time EVER, he had difficulty in reaching some of the higher notes. And, at times, he merely SPEAKS the words!!!!!  Has anyone else noticed???  Also, I was hoping that he would perform ""Atlantis.""  He did not.

  Still, the DVD is well worth the price. I was just surprised to see him struggling on the vocals.",1203984000,9,904,4.365269461077844
2920202,5,B000UC33NO,"Everything thing is fun to watch and listen to in this DVD: the stories about being in India with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the words and rhythms of the songs, the way Donovan gets the audience to sing along, the sweet duets with his daughter Astrella Celeste.  Here is an entertainer who has evolved over the years. He started as a great song writer and singer, and he continues to uncover deeper layers of consciousness in his work.",1203638400,16,431,4.597402597402597
2920203,5,B000UC33NO,"Hi !

I am a long time fan of Donovan and seeing him on stage, facing 3000 poeple of all different generations and making them smile and clap their hands like children, move me deeply.
I am belgian, I live in the South of France, so I have few chances to see an artist like Donovan on stage. The last time was in 1997, in Paris.
I know that for a lot of poeple of our ""ever speed way of life"" society, an artist like Donovan sounds like a ""has been"".
No need to discuss our tastes, everyone has his own, and it is just all right like this.
But for me, listening to Donovan is like a walk in my ""secret garden"", where I can connect again with my chilhood soul.
So I enjoy this DVD like a precious moment of inner peace, and now I am longing fir his next album, ""Ritual Groove"", that seems to be in good progress.

Thank you for reading my ""poor"" english, and enjoy Donovan or whatever music you like as often as possible !

Best regards,

8212842,4,B000UC33NO,"This is a later performance by Donovan. His daughter appears on this DVD also. I enjoyed this but what I would rather have is one of his early performances. The aura, if you will, or ambience is just very different than early Donovan. Lets just say it is a bit too polished or modern.",1512950400,,284,4.277777777777778

8212850,5,B000UC33NO,"This DVD is well made and features the best music ever produced by Donovan. He also has his daughter, David Lynch and one of the Beach Boys, (whose name I fail to remember), as guests. For those of you that loved the era of love and peace that attracted many of us to the hippy way of life this is a must have concert. He also talks about his friendship with the Beatles (mainly George Harrison) and their trip together with others to India.
