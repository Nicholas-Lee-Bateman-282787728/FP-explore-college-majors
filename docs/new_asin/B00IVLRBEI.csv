6300384,1,B00IVLRBEI,"The story plot is a new twist, a bunch of senior citizens going to the war to rescue their grandsons that the military was written off.  The acting is pretty bad though.  Although the actors try to make us believe they care unconditionally for their beloved grandsons, they are constantly giving up their ""fight"" very time some little setback happens.  And I do mean ""little"" setbacks, like the enemy slowly driving away from their fight.  They certainly aren't ""Dependable"".  The characters don't act as we would expect, a former Navy Seal who can't hold a pistol correctly, smoking a cigar and having no noise discipline.  Margot Kidder ruins the movie.  Aside from the idea that somehow these guys would drag a 65 year old grandmother into a war zone, I honestly believe she forgot how to act.  She seems more concerned about her stolen military uniform having the wrong rank than she cares about her grandson.  She actually ruins the movie.  For a bunch of former military men, they sure are gutless.  The movie does have some good concepts though that bring back memories of the corruption during Vietnam.  The lead actor has  potential, too bad they teamed him up with those other actors.  I expected better than I got.  I'm retired military almost 60 years old, my wife and I both agree: don't pay full price for this one, wait until it hits the flea market for a dollar.  I don't normally rate movies on line, but this crap needs an honest review.",1407974400,3,1455,4.669291338582677

8645746,1,B00IVLRBEI,"If I could give this movie negative stars I would. I'm amazed that someone actually funded this low budget piece of crap but at least they didn't spend too much. The concept could have maybe worked if it were a comedy but they tried to make it dramatic. The writing is bad, the acting is bad, everything about it is just plain bad. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Do something more productive with your time, like counting the blades of grass in your back yard.",1470355200,,476,4.359550561797753
