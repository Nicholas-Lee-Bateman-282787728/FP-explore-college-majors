6872406,3,B00QJAZ514,I can't get any captions. Anyone else having this problem?,1423267200,,58,4.9
6872407,1,B00QJAZ514,"This is one of those movies that needs to spawn a hundred Internet memes. Consider this: it has Nicolas Cage and Hayden Christensen... repeatedly trying to act opposite each other.

Consider that.

But Christensen's wooden mumbling and Cage's wild mood swings are only one of the problems with ""Outcast,"" which has the genius idea of sending oh-so-traumatized Knights Templar to medieval China. It could have been a cheesy, entertaining action movie, but its overly serious tone and around-the-board wretched acting just make it a chore to sit through.

During the Crusades, a knight named Gallain (Cage) randomly decides that Crusading Be Bad, and begs his young charge Jacob (Christensen) to stop fighting and go East with him. Why East, instead of home? Never explained. Jacob doesn't agree... until he decides he does in mid-battle, and just...walks away. And apparently walks to China, because the story then jumps to the king (not emperor?) of China.

The king has decided that his younger son is going to be his successor, which enrages his elder, warrior son Shing (Andy On). The king does this in the least efficient way possible by not publicly announcing it, and sending his new heir with exactly one loyal supporter, his martially-inept sister Lian (Yifei Liu), on a road trip with no supplies or even horses. Why? Because this conveniently allows Shing to kill his dad and frame his brother for it, taking the throne for himself.

So the kids end up stumbling across Jacob, who has become an opium-addicted bum, but he's SO good with his sword that he can defeat a whole squad of Black Guards (har har) while high as a kite. They pay him to help them get to loyal generals who can help them... but of course, they don't actually find these generals. Instead, they stumble across Gallain (what a coincidence!) who happens to be a notorious bandit called the White Ghost. And Gallain is... not their only hope for battling Shing. He ultimately doesn't help at all.

""Outcast"" was made by Nick Powell, an experienced stunt coordinator/fight choreographer who has worked in a lot of TV shows and movies like ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""28 Days Later."" And you can tell he has seen good movies... and loves good movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Hero""... but hasn't quite figured out how to properly make one. He knows that certain things belong in an action epic, but not how to put them together.

So most of ""Outcast"" is made up of people traveling... and traveling... and occasionally having implausible fight scenes (sword-fighting while high on opium? Sure!). There are long stretches of not-much happening, and subplots that ultimately don't go anywhere. For instance, Guillan actually has little, if anything to do with the main plot, and he serves no real purpose -- he's not a voice of conscience because he's too bitterly amoral, and he's not a catalyst for redemption or anything. Yet his final scenes are handled with more melodramatic gravitas than the deaths of Boromir and Darth Vader combined -- excessive slow-motion and a choir of mournful angelic voices.

And some of the directorial choices are... bizarre. One scene has Christensen upending a bucket of water over his anachronistic faux-hawk... and the camera is shooting from INSIDE THE BUCKET. It's one of those stylistic decisions that just leaves you thinking, ""Why?"" And Powell misses some opportunities as a storyteller -- while both Jacob and Shing are warriors who have done terrible things in the service of someone, this duality is never explored or even hinted at.

And the climax? It wants SO desperately to be epic. But does it have loyal generals massing an army and storming the palace? Does it have ""Lord of the Rings""-style battle? NO. Why would it? It has two guys having a rather awkward sword fight while a WHOLE ARMY just stands and does nothing. Absolutely nothing.

As mentioned before, Cage and Christensen display the onscreen chemistry of two large logs banging against each other. Christensen woodenly mumbles through his role, conveying none of the inner torment and self-loathing that his character is supposed to. We're told that Jacob has a deep-rooted thirst for blood and love of killing, but shown no savage glee or abandon when he fights -- he just bumbles around, looking constipated.

And Cage (who is in the movie for about ten minutes total), veers wildly between ""I don't care enough to act"" and ""I'm chewing the scenery,"" sometimes in the same sentence. He also dons a terrible topknot wig and an equally terrible English accent. Most of the other actors are similarly leaden, with the exception of On -- the poor guy is pouring his all into his tormented villain role, and he's an excellent fighter. He also has bucketloads more charisma and character development than Christensen does.

""Outcast"" deserves to be one -- it's a freshman bumble with a leaden pace, wretched acting, odd direction and a villain who frankly seems more developed than the hero. Avoid this mess.",1421539200,28,4989,4.933253873659118
6872408,2,B00QJAZ514,"Jacob (Hayden Christensen) and  Glenn (Nicolas Cage) are 12th century crusaders fighting in an unnamed city.  Jacob  can go into a beserker mode when he says, ""God wills it"" or when someone else says, ""Kill him."" Glenn is regretful about the crusades and opts to go East.

The film then opens up in the East with some palace intrigue and a plot evolving like ""Star Wars"" where a princess and her brother flee from the Black Guards. They find assistance in Jacob, an opium addict, who still has his beserker mode working.

The film is formulaic as you know exactly what the final fight will be. Cage haters can add this to their list of bad performances, one I would say was worse than ""Left Behind."" WOW! What was that accent supposed to be? Hayden Christenson started out with a strong accent and ended the film without one.

Will work as a second tier rental.

Special mention goes to Nicholas Cage for the worst performance of his career, and I say this as a fan of Nic Cage. Someone let him attempt a British accent and the result, combined with Cage's performance as an errant crazy Templar is ahhhh, hysterically awful.

The characters and dialogue were good, too, though I found the expediency of everyone speaking English a little odd at first. I was hoping for more cultural touches in their behavior, as this movie had Muslim, Hindu, Christian and other backdrops and characters, but not bad. The flashbacks weren't too obnoxious, though I found the timing weird. For example, the main character says he didn't kill the women and children, that the women had killed thier own children and then themselves, but this flashback is only at the very end.",1467331200,,689,4.897435897435898

6872457,4,B00QJAZ514,"Maybe it's a sign that I stayed up way too late watching this, but I thought this was actually a fairly well done film. I can't say it's exactly historically accurate, but it doesn't really claim to be, either. What you can expect: the cinematography is great, the plot is fairly decent (for an action flick), the characters were surprisingly pretty deep (if maybe a bit clich), but the fight scenes are what steal the show. The choreography pretty much made up for the fact that Christensen and Cage can't act (Note: don't watch this movie for the acting. It's not so bad that it ruins the whole movie, but it's Cage during his off years... Just a heads-up.) Also, for those of you who might be interested, there's just enough romance to make it sweet, but not enough to make it raunchy. All things considered, compared to most action flicks out there right now, this is actually one of the better ones. I'll watch it again.",1439856000,7,925,4.544910179640719

I will keep this brief.  The scenery and cinematography are stunning.  The plot is kind of common- the king is on his deathbed and the heirs, two brothers, rival for the throne.  One is pure of heart and the other evil. I like Hayden Christensen for the part of Jacob.  I like Hayden in all his films, but the critics really cut him up in the Star Wars Prequels (I loved his performance). I do like Nick Cage at times (in other movies), but I'm not sure why the heck he was cast.  I don't know what you call that accent, but it was horrendous.

There is lots of action, lots of blood, lots of hatred and revenge.  I cannot speak of it's historical accuracy, and there are no awards to be won here, but I have no regrets about watching the film.  I cannot think of any good reasons not to watch the film, unless you abhor violence or you are  Nick Cage hater, but he has very little screen time actually.",1438732800,2,1117,4.096774193548387

trouble finds him when unwittingly he becomes involved with a young prince and his sister who are fleeing their elder
brother who intends to claim the throne his father had bestowed upon the young prince.
They are pursued relentlessly by the Black Guard who now do the bidding of the elder brother.
'Jacob' cannot fulfil the task he has taken on alone they are chased into the region where the legendary outlaw known as
'The White Ghost' holds sway, the outlaw turns out to be 'Gallain' (Nicolas Cage) who had years before taught 'Jacob' all
he knows and had fought alongside him during the Crusades.
'Gallain' at first does not want to become involved, there is nothing in it for him, however The Black Guards will keep coming
until they have the young prince and the 'seal' his father had given him as a symbol of his right to rule......will 'Gillain' help
his old friend and comrade ensure the rightful brother takes the throne.
It's an enjoyable romp of Swords and Arrows though falling well short of being a must-see adventure perhaps.
I have to agree with comments made by earlier reviewers who have indicated that 'Nicolas Cage' is worthy of more significant
roles than this.
It seems in recent years, sadly, that he takes every role offered ??
There was a time, in the not too distant past when i'm sure he could easily of taken his pick of roles offered.

After a bloody siege, Jacob travels to China (dont ask me how), where he, now opium-addicted, reluctantly helps a young prince Zhao (Bill Su Jiahang) and his sister Lian (Liu Yifei) on the run from their murderous older brother Shing (Andy On).

The films east-meets-west premise has some potential for entertaining action movie, which Outcast is simply not. The Canadian-Chinese-US movie is utterly devoid of any tension whatsoever because of the poorly done combat sequences with restless camera and little to none choreography. As to Nicholas Cage, well, his hairstyle is certainly unique.

I don't care if the films story is preposterous as long as it entertains me. National Treasure is a fun ride despite (and because of) its incredible story. The only thing I found good about Outcast is the beautiful on-location shots in China, which is not enough to make a decent action movie.",1435017600,,1083,5.078651685393258

6872491,4,B00QJAZ514,"I am not sure why everyone always wants to pan on Nicholas Cage and Hayden Christianson's acting, to be truthful they weren't given a lot to do in the movie past fighting. It was the camera angles and the constant switching views is what nearly gave me a headache but I suppose if you don't have a large budget for action sequences you can pretend things are happening by ""sorta"" showing the fighting.  The foggy opium points of view and flashbacks were overused.

N. Cage was really only more of a supporting actor and both actors were drug abusers (opium, alcohol) hoping to dull their many sins so one can reasonably expect them to behave the way they portrayed their characters, with halting speech patterns and wooden emotions.  If anything, the actors who portrayed the sibling prince and princess were the weak links in the acting department.

I rented it for 99 cents and had waited a very long time to do so because of the bad reviews.  Which brings me to my biggest complaint about my fellow Amazon (and Google Play) reviewers: If you are going to take the time to write a review then for gawd's sake EXPLAIN why you rated it that way in complete sentences and more than one or two words. Otherwise your review is a complete waste of time.  You want your 2 hours back for watching a bad movie?  I can bet that you've spent more than that doing even worse things and using a cliche to rate a movie wastes a few minutes of your oh-so-precious time too.

The fight scenes were some of the best I have seen in a movie, honestly. I was genuinely entertained during EVERY fight scene in this movie that involved Hayden. Excellent job. The story was okay, it reminded me a lot of Gladiator, minus the gladiators of course. Hayden's acting was impressive, he even had a decent acccent most of the time. Nicholas Cage was not near as bad as some reviews here are saying, they had me expecting his worst performance ever. It was just out of character for him to do a role like this is all, he did fine as far as I am concerned. Not sure why they had to give him a popeye though, that part was pretty stupid and pointless, I think it only added to the perception he was overacting.

The negatives here other than Cage's popeye....the story seemed like 1 hour buildup/development followed by 40 minutes of everything else crunched into one. At about 45-60 minutes in the movie felt like it could easily go on for 3 more hours, the story just was not progressing as I felt it should. This made it feel slow. The only thing that saves it during this time are the excellent fight scenes. Giving the Asians British accents had me thinking wtf, it was very distracting and you lost immersion a lot when you heard them.

6872502,3,B00QJAZ514,"The film, Outcast, has great scenery/settings, makeup, and period costuming. The choreography is realistic in the gritty fight scenes. This may be due to British stunt director, Nick Powells acumen with stunt escapades. Powell was the action choreographer for the movie, The Bourne Identity, which IMO had the best fight scenes of the trilogy. This is Powells first attempt at directing a film, which may explain why the film leans heavily on fighting scenes yet stumbles and falls in dialogue and acting. The film is financed by Chinese Yunnan Film Group and under the label of Arclight Films (Forbidden Kingdom, et al.)

**Potential Spoiler Alert**
The story is set during 12th century Crusades and features Knights Templar Jacob (Hayden Christensen), and Gallain (Nicolas Cage). Since Gallain swore to Jacobs father that he would protect him, he is Jacobs shadow. He had asked Jacob to come with him to the East, but Jacob wonders why anyone would go east when Crusaders returned home by traveling west. Jacob releases Gallain from his vow. With Jacob in fighting mode there is frenetic and bloodthirsty action justified by the notion that the carnage is Gods will. When Gallain mistakenly believes that Jacob has committed a beyond-the-pale atrocity, he leaves and disappears. Next, viewers are witnessing an aged Chinese leader bestowing his kingdom to his young son and asking his daughter Lian (Liu Yifei) to protect this son. The leader has another elder son, Shing (Andy On), who is a valiant and bloodthirsty warrior. The aging Chinese leader now wants peace and believes his younger son can achieve it.

Thus begins the saga of Shing pursuing his birthright by annihilating all who stand in his way, particularly his brother & sister. Enter opium-addicted Jacob hanging out in a bar where the fleeing heir and his sister frantically plead for help to no avail. Shings warriors arrive and are on the brink of killing the royal siblings when a very drugged-up Jacob somehow manages to rescue them. On the run, they keep hearing about the fabled White Ghost but do not realize that it is none other than Gallain.
**End Potential Spoiler Alert**

The dialogue is uninspired and Nicholas Cages acting veers erratically between hot water steaming mad and cold water indifference. He either speaks softly or screams with spittle. The British accents delivered by both are horrible and Christensen gives up his after the first several scenes. The plot plods along so slowly and it is odd that opium-addicted Christensen never builds up a tolerance to the drug, so special effects makes it seem as though he is high as a kite when he is sword fighting.

I could not make it to the end of the film, however. Maybe I was tired. This is not an edge of your seat film and does not even land in the same galaxy as the Crusades period movie, Kingdom of Heaven. Still, the choreography isn't shabby and a viewer may enjoy the settings or period costuming. I think Hayden Christensen has aged into a handsome man.",1433203200,,3007,4.901768172888016

Outcast is a well-done movie.  It's no Die Hard or Kingdom of Heaven, but it's as good or better than Ironclad or Robin Hood or Pathfinder.  Watch it!  You will be entertained.

True, this is a TERRIBLE vehicle for Nickey Cage, he has come to that point in his career where he is willing to take risks for the sheer joy of being a part of something smashingly different. That is what this is. As with any movie, we must suspend belief, and we must often accept poor scripting, acting, and directing in order to enjoy a rare epicness that uniquely pleases.

The FIVE STARS I render hereunto are for that Unique Epicness! If you enjoy films for the sake of sheer beauty, elegance captured through the lens, then this is a movie you too will LOVE!.  It is one of the most visually appealing movies I have seen. The Demi Moore HALF LIGHT ghost story is my favorite for stunning color and natural beauty. This one has actually tied HALF LIGHT for the title.

Any Chinese movie, of modern creation, is going to boast scenery that is overwhelmingly kind to the eyes. But in the manner this movie was filmed, you will find that virtually every scene captures some point of beauty that can only be described as breathtaking.

The martial arts and sword battles are pleasingly done as well. This movie could have starred Justin Bieber opposite Ron Jeremy as the two Euro leads, and this still would have been a visually compelling motion picture. Do not expect Shakesperian performances from Cage or Christensen.

6872555,3,B00QJAZ514,"Outcast was an interesting idea in theory, but it's not without its flaws.

Slight plot description ahead.

In the film, Nicolas Cage and Hayden Christiansen are two Crusader Knights, who've had enough of the fighting. After the opening battle, they travel East towards China, where they hope to find clarity and peace over their years of war. The two men part ways after having differences with one another. Christiansen eventually becomes involved in a dispute, between the Emperor's two sons who are both vying for the throne. One is the rightful heir, while the other one believes he deserves to be Emperor. Cage and Christiansen do meet up again towards the end, where they make a stand for their new found, Chinese friends. But the film is mostly about Christiansen's character. The film takes us through several scenes of fleeing battles and slight character development, until it reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well this film was not the best I've ever seen from this genre. However, if you're willing to let go of historical reality, it can be quite entertaining. Hayden Christiansen did a decent job with the physical part of his role. His dramatic acting was just so, so. But he gets the job done. Kind of like Aaron Taylor Johnson's acting in the last Godzilla film, a bit dry at times.  Nicolas Cage on the other hand tried out some sort of angry British accent, which took some getting used to. I eventually got past his attempt at a character voice, but it was a little like watching Dennis Quaid's strange accent attempt in the film Dragonheart. It was more distracting than anything else. But his real voice might not have fit either. I'm not sure he was the best pick for this film, even though it was Nicolas Cage.

I don't agree with some of the reviewers here that all the acting was bad. It was passable. And you have to remember, this wasn't a big budget blockbuster. It was a joint effort between western and eastern film makers. Nor is this a martial arts film. The battles had sword fights, but only one of them could be characterized as a Kung Fu fight, and that was performed by a Chinese Monk.

Plot and story wise, we've seen films like this before. But for ""home video markets,"" it was a fair attempt, considering it was an east meets west blend. The battle sequences used that shaky camera style, which I don't really care for. I would have preferred more steady shots myself.  But overall, it wasn't too distracting.

All the dialogue is in English, so there's no subtitles to read. And on the DVD and Bluray versions, there's also an informative set of interviews with Cage, Christiansen and the director. I found them interesting, especially the director's take on the film. Cage had some good things to say too, although I know he's done better work in the past.

In the end, Outcast is just an OK film. It's not great, but it's not terrible either. It's entertaining and has some good action, as well as a decent blend of East meets West outtakes. I doubt most people need to purchase this one. If you're interested in it at all, a one time viewing might be in order. I'll probably give it another watch before I'm through with it, mainly to see if I missed anything the first time around.",1428278400,5,3244,4.608318890814558

He seeks the help of Jacob (Christensen) to protect him and help him take his rightful seat. Unsure he can handle the task alone, he enlist the help of the mysterious Gallain (Cage) and together the two try and fix the wrong. As many of you know I am not a fan of Nicolas Cage at all. Ill open with that because that has an impact on the review. On the plus side though, he isn't the main star of the movie and is only in about half. Even with the lack of wall to wall Cage the movie is still barely watchable. Boring dialog mixed with overly choreographed fight scenes make the movie a struggle to get through. All this said, keep in mind that I have an instant bias toward Cage and it takes a lot for him to change my mind. Overall, if you like Cage and medieval movies then this is something you would enjoy.

Some mentioned that an army should have saved them in the end but that wouldn't have gone with the storyline or the type of film it was trying to portray.

It was weird, especially hearing the CHINESE royal family speaking like that. It was hard to understand Hayden when he was talking too.
I was disappointed that Yifei Liu didn't have any fighting sequences at all. I love her in the ""FOUR"" trilogy and ""The Forbidden Kingdom"". It really sucked cuz they portrayed her as this helpless girl that didn't know how to protect herself or her brother, and made Hayden do all the fighting.",1425081600,5,606,4.780952380952381

Nicolas Cages acting is at his worst. He plays the role of an one-eyed guy without wearing an eye patch!  He walks around squinting one of his eyes to pretend its a blind eye. It looks so childish and fake that it makes me laugh many times. I cant believe that any director would direct a movie this way.
