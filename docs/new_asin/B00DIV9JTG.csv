8593623,1,B00DIV9JTG,"The reason I gave this rating is that when I bought this movie it was supposed to be a 40th Edition. Nowhere on it did it say that, and I was disappointed. That movie was my son's favorite when he was a little guy, and is now 32 and I was hoping for something on the case indicating that. It was one of his ""fun"" presents..",1475020800,,323,3.909090909090909
8593624,1,B00DIV9JTG,Region 2 means it only works in DVD players in Europe. We live in the United States and did not know this and now have a Robin Hood DVD that doesn't work and looks like we can't return. Would be helpful if in the information about product section on Amazon if this was clearly stated. Some of us do not know the DVD regions of everywhere in the world!,1459382400,,351,4.101449275362318
8593625,5,B00DIV9JTG,My kids and I live the movie. It is one of the Disney greats.,1458172800,,61,3.4285714285714284

8593628,1,B00DIV9JTG,"DVD'S  would not work...who would think of checking the region? I wouldn't. I ordered these for a gift and they were sent
to two different people in two different states. I am not going to ask these people to  send the DVD'S back to me and then ship them back for a refund. It is embarrassing and disappointing. Does Disney do this kind of thing? I guess I will find out.",1361923200,,371,4.211267605633803
8593629,1,B00DIV9JTG,"I was on a mad search to find the classic Disney cartoon Robin Hood for my son, as I had many fond memories of watching this film with my father and I was so excited that the company Movie Mars Inc. had this film....so I thought. When I received the package the cover of the DVD was the movie I ordered but when I put the film in the screen was blank with the words ""check regional code"" and there was no option to hit play or enjoy this film with my family. So, as you can imagine I was p.o. I emailed Movie Mars Inc. to inquire about a refund, we have been emailing back and forth about this matter and I had to ship the item back to them on my dollar and I'm still waiting for my refund...it's been one month!
I have never had an issue using Amazon vendors before so please don't be to discouraged by this review, I personally would never use Movie Mars Inc again.",1361318400,,867,4.046511627906977
8593630,2,B00DIV9JTG,I am not sure that the one I received was the one that I say pictures of.  The one that I thought I ordered came with the raised slip cover.  I also did not know what the region 2 meant and it does not play in any DVD player in our house.,1360454400,,238,3.5576923076923075
8593631,1,B00DIV9JTG,"Tried playing the DVD on two different DVD players without success. I had a VHS copy of this movie years ago and loved the movie. This was a gift for my little nephew. Needless to say, we were very disappointed that this DVD would not play. I contacted the seller, who suggested it may have been a European version, and then left it up to me to figure that out based on looking for either the number ""1"" or ""2"" somewhere on the item description page. I would suggest that sellers make this information more apparent on the item description page when selling to both customers in the U.S. and Europe. It is important to note, as with many Disney movies, this DVD is not in current production and availability is limited. As a result, this item was purchased from an independent seller through Amazon.com. I love Amazon.com and do not feel that Amazon was in any way at fault for the lack of disclosure in the product description for this item.",1359158400,,942,4.482558139534884
