8002736,5,B0000TPBDM,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Inuyasha and the others enter a battle with another of Naraku's incarnations. During the fight Inuyasha's sword is broken. He learns that it served a dual purpose. Not only does it protect him form his enemies, it also keeps his demon self from overpowering him. With the sword broken, Inuyasha loses control and slaughters the demon. He also has no realization that he is acting so savage. This scares Kagome, and she is the only person who can snap him out of it. He will need to strengthen himself, and get his sword fixed so that this won't happen again.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353283200,,1704,4.423566878980892
8002737,5,B0000TPBDM,Inuyasha is one of the Best Animes there is out there. On this DVD you see a whole other side to him. Its very interesting.,1178668800,,123,3.96
8002738,5,B0000TPBDM,"Episode 45, ""Sesshoumaru wields Tokijin"" is one of my favorite episodes that deal with Inuyasha and his older brother Sesshoumaru.  Among the relationships that exist between the characters in the series (romantic or otherwise), I find the one between the two brothers to be the most intriguing. Most viewers see it as one of deep hatred, or at the very least extreme dislike. But it is in fact much more complex. In the beginning, there's no question that Sesshoumaru hated his half brother, whom he considers inferior because of his human lineage. There is also the intense jealousy because their father left the sword that he desires so much to Inuyasha. He tried to kill Inuyasha for it but lost his left arm in the process, adding to the enmity. Since then at every encounter Sesshoumaru tries to kill Inuyasha -- or so it seems. Yet as the story develops, Sesshoumaru's murderous intentions become less and less clear.

The fact is, if Sesshomaru had truly wanted to kill Inuyasha, he would be able to do it without difficulty.  Inuyasha is no match for Sesshomaru, who is faster and far more powerful than him, and remorseless. In episode 45, Sesshoumaru attacked Inuyasha with his new sword Tokijin and was able to hurl the Tetsusaiga out of Inuyasha's hand because it was too heavy. He could have killed Inuyasha right there with his sword, but instead he blasted him away. Then he charged towards Inuyasha, and everyone thought he was going to kill Inuyasha. But Sesshoumaru's intention all along was to push Inuyasha to the brink because he wanted to see Inuyasha's demonic transformation.

Later on in eps. 75-77 ""Curse of Generations"" (vols. 25-26, already available ) and eps. 79-81 ""Brothers in Arms"" (vol. 27, also already available) -- in my opinion the best episodes so far -- the two brothers fight together. Although there is clearly animosity between them and their co-operation is not of their intention, Sesshoumaru allows Inuyasha to fight alongside himself.  After he released the life force from the master of the panther tribe with his Tensaiga (ep. 77), he could have finished him up with Tokijin. But he let Inuyasha bring the demon down with the Tetsusaiga.

It is also interesting how Sesshoumaru repeatedly tells Inuyasha and the others (in several different episodes) that he will be the one to kill Inuyasha. It can certainly be interpreted as a threat born out of hatred, but there is another side to it: that he will not let anyone else kill Inuyasha.  In other words, he is protecting Inuyasha. This also happens in the first movie ""Affection Touching Across Times"", during Sesshoumaru's brief encounter with Kikyo. Knowing how much Kikyo hated Inuyasha, he told her that she could do anything she wanted except killing Inuyasha, because he would be the one to do it.

Of all the characters in Inuyasha, Sesshoumaru's is the most enigmatic; hidden behind his aristocratic demeanor and quiet elegance. He is cold and despises humans, yet his affection for Rin, a human girl, goes so far as facing off with Naraku when the latter abducted her. He may be jealous of Inuyasha owning the Tetsusaiga, but there are many times when he foregoes the opportunity to kill his brother, and instead pushing him so he would discover the true value of the sword. There may not be love between the two brothers, but one wonders if they are truly enemies either.",1098921600,6,3382,4.859375
8002739,5,B0000TPBDM,"The first of the three episodes is great.  Shippo gets wrapped up by some soul collectors - ""let go o' me you slithery demons!"" and there follows a good scene between the still wounded Inu-Yasha, Kikyo, and a snooping Kagura.  The third incarnation of Naraku is truly creepy and fightening, and the battle to defeat him is as entertaining as previous encounters with Naraku and Kagura.

The second and third episodes are not as intense and cover familiar territory of forging magical swords, a sub-plot with the evil student of an elderly swordsmith, and Inu-Yasha's half brother.",1096588800,3,580,4.958762886597938
8002740,5,B0000TPBDM,"This is a definent must-have for all inuyasha fans. The humor is great, the drama is superb, and the action will make you want to watch it again and again! I mean, who wouldn't want to see Inuyasha and co. fighting evil demons? Oh, and did I mention that Naraku has a new incarnation that can read minds, Inuyasha transforms into a full demon, and Sesshoumaru gains a new sword that can rival the power of the Tetsusaiga? Well, I guess I have now. Order it today, and I swear that you will NOT be disappointed!",1070409600,10,510,4.322916666666667
