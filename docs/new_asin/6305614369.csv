Not only do you get the Albert Hall concert but a documentary on the flip side...and i swear it looks like  Steve Miller hanging out beside Paul during the recording session!
BUY  IT!",947635200,15,293,4.596153846153846

7892381,5,6305614369,What is there to say. Anything by Paul has gotta be great! He can play all kinds of music. No. 1 in my book.,1378598400,,108,3.5416666666666665
7892382,4,6305614369,"I found this performance to be better than McCartney's CD. That said, the sound on the DVD could have been better; that is not to say that the quality is bad, it could have been better. The 5.1 mix is a waste, as most sound in the rear speakers is applause. I still recommend this, Paul's second outing of Classical compositions it is performed with passion that you can feel while viewing.
I am a lifetime fan of Paul's music, but also have been listening to and enjoying Classical music for about 30 years.",1370044800,,508,4.414893617021277

7892384,5,6305614369,I have had the DVD for many years and always quite liked it but I have just played it again after a long time and it just completely awe struck me how brilliant and beautiful the music actually is. I probably put this down to my maturing musical tastes. Always a fan of Paul's pop and rock but this is completely beyond anything Paul has done before including Liverpool Oratorio. I must give Ecce Cor Meum another listen to see it's effect on me. I hope Paul has plenty more of this symphonic type music to come.,1327795200,,512,4.288659793814433

Paul wrote this piece about a photo Linda took.  She died one year after the piece was written and published.  For me it sums up their true love.  The music , the orchestra and the choir are superb.  You buy this DVD!!!!",1311206400,,397,7.020408163265306

7892387,3,6305614369,"Now if you ask me, and plenty of folks what are interested in this here type of music do now and again, this here type of music is certainly interesting... but unlike what you might could except from Sir Paul.

In fact, I can recognize how beautiful the music is... but at the same time I don't want to hear it... or see it. It pains me to have to write that because I love Paul McCartney's work and I also appreciate symphonic ditties now and again, but combining Paul McCartney and the symphony just don't crack my whip. I hereby apologize to all them fans out there who were expecting me to come up with some flattering effluvium at this point. Ain't gonna happen.

I say; buy this DVD if you want to, but be prepared for it to not sound nothin' like what you are used to and be prepared to also not watch it ever again ifin you ain't a particular fan of the symphony sound. Again, I want to stress that this sure enough is right beautiful, but it just ain't my jug of corn squeezins.

Mama don't like this one because she says it's too high falootin' for her blood, so I pretty much leave it off the DVD player gizmo whenever she's around.",1105488000,,1143,4.210045662100456
7892388,5,6305614369,"In some cases, enjoyment and appreciation of a work is enhanced by increased knowledge of the work.  That is certainly the case with this video.  For twenty-some dollars, you get a really insightful documentary of how Standing Stone came to be, rehearsals for the big Albert Hall concert, and the concert itself.
Revelatory - that is the only word.
Plus it's kind of cool to actually have so much material on a DVD that I have to flip it over.  I get that retro feeling through my bones!",984960000,2,487,4.511363636363637
7892389,5,6305614369,"I missed the telecast of this performance on A&E in 1997 when it came out, and it finally came out on DVD! Seems like Paul has a documentary film on everything he does, but this one was the best I've seen.  One section shows how he wrote the piece on a computer, without reading music.  Mostly  though, it shows Standing Stone as a work in progress through subsequent  rehearsals, etc, and variations made ""on the fly"" to the piece.  A great documentary fitting to a great, under-appreciated musician who,  since Flowers In The Dirt, is undoubtedly a better songwriter and more  varied musician then he ever was as a Beatle.  Some may disagree, but  Flaming Pie gets more listens than Abbey Road around my place.  The video  of the concert is captivating, and the camera work is fairly active so you  don't fall asleep staring at one musician!  All else said, this is a great  DVD which is packed with alot of good material and is well worth the (price).",958780800,12,954,4.535294117647059
