7513363,5,B017RR6JYE,"If you like cloak and dagger movies with that dark, cloudy European look, this movie is for you. It's got all the sneaking around, gun play, deception, cars, and unshaven agents in their leather jackets and unkempt hair. The story is good, apparently based on a British tv show which we in America are not familiar with.  The movie has a great modern look and feel. Go and watch it...",1516060800,,384,4.485714285714286

7513399,5,B017RR6JYE,"This was my first exposure to MI-5 drama. Lots of various reviews about the film were widespread, but in the end it was a very good and interesting plot. As much psychological as action-packed which made it all the more interesting. The twists in the movie add a lot to keep your mind bending through the whole film and guessing. The typical villains are shown and the mind of terrorists are looked at from different angles which makes it a good study in film, in plots, people, and a peak into the halls of power.",1509580800,,514,4.421052631578948

7513471,4,B017RR6JYE,"This is movie is psychological. It's not flashy or gory. It's an insane situation with impossible decisions. As terrorist movies go, the bad guy's motivation is actually understandable and potentially sympathetic. It's better than Bourne; that last movie was awful. It's a completely different type of movie than Mission Impossible. This isn't about cool, pretty people saving the world and making jokes as they do it. It's about choices and the price of having to choose.",1505606400,,472,5.223684210526316

7513479,4,B017RR6JYE,"I'm assuming this script was written before the current wave of European carnage at the hands of ISIS and its supporters. If the script were written after Paris, after Brussels, after London, the writers would not have portrayed the main terrorist with an ounce of sympathy, i.e. not targeting civilians, letting civilians go free, etc. But moral scruples on both sides is what makes a good spy movie. In movies such as this, it won't do to make the main bad guy ""all bad."" Sadly, in Europe today, the terrorists are, indeed, all bad, purposefully targeting civilians and not deserving an sympathy at all.",1499731200,,605,4.826923076923077
7513480,4,B017RR6JYE,"The fact that this wasn't given a clear four-star is telling about the intelligence of many reviewers. It's a talented, well-made piece of work by someone whom many jokes are made about as a 'sexy, brooding hero' and 'eye-candy'. Probably why Kit Harington isn't in more movies and series BESIDES Game of Thrones - and that fact irritates the blazes out of me. He's a talented actor who would be a joy if given more varied projects like this one. If anyone cares why we don't get good movies anymore much these days like Chinatown, The Big Sleep and Smilla's Sense of Snow, all we have to do is look at that foolish, disappointing, little fact . . . honestly we don't deserve better.",1499385600,,683,4.516129032258065

I really do love a good spy thriller, but I tend to like the ones with a clear cut victory in the end.  So I am not going to discuss the acting, the complicated plot, the subtle  innuendo of the characters, or anything else the technical movie goers want to delve into.  It would probably help if you were British, but I am not.  I prefer a movie where I do not feel as if my dog just died, even though he may have saved the city.  In other words, I really do wish I had never watched it, even though I was interested to the very end.  I prefer to be entertained, and not depressed.",1487462400,,690,3.9565217391304346

7513579,2,B017RR6JYE,"I have always been a fan of the British show MI5, the lead agents have always been dynamite and likeable (mostly) and Harry has been a constant presence with a great mysterious character.  That being said, this movie was a bit of a disappointment.  Kit Harrington just doesn't strike me as leading man material, he just lacks charisma and believability for me.  I would have loved to have seen this with either someone from the show previously in the lead or a new fresh British actor.  For me, I prefer to remember MI5 from the last episode of season 10, and I'll just forget this existed.",1473811200,,590,4.537735849056604
7513580,1,B017RR6JYE,"I turned this movie off an hour into it.  I don't do that often.  I've seen thousands of movies and can count the number of films I've walked out of on my two hands.

Why did I turn it off?  There was absolutely NO character development.  It was a collection of scenes of people doing things, sometimes trying to act cool, while speaking incomplete lines and zero basis to go on who they actually were other than... good guy or bad guy.  I had no connection with the characters, I didn't care what happened, and the plot continued on like everything happening was important.

It was shot well.  The camera work was good, the special effects were nice.  But none of that makes a movie or for that matter a story.  Characters are the lifeblood of fiction.  Without a reason to care about or hate them, what's the point?

I never saw the television series, and I know nothing about it.  But I shouldn't have to see a TV show to enjoy a film.  The movie should give us enough information by itself for us to want to keep watching and feel for the folks in the scenes.  This one did not.",1473724800,,1082,4.287128712871287

7513607,1,B017RR6JYE,"This isn't the review I wanted to write: I'm a total ""Spooks"" fan and was unaware this 'continuation' film had been made. I looked at the preview and wan pondering whether to purchase the digital vid. I inadvertently hit the 'order' button, realized what I had done, and cancelled it immediately. I went to my account profile to set up a pin number to prevent a future mistake, and when I returned to the order screen, there was a note saying I couldn't cancel because I had opened the video file - which I hadn't. I've now spent several hours trying to reach someone human @ Amazon so I can cancel this -- without success.

7513684,3,B017RR6JYE,"I watched this Film not knowing that it was based upon a British series Spooks, so take the review with that in mind.  The film is more grounded then most spy films, not a lot of one guy fighting his way thorough 10 people, getting hit repeatedly and feeling no Ill effects.  This film is no tinker taylor either, people are killed sometimes in broad daylight yet no general panic ensues.  The film tries to walk a fine line between to two styles and falls flat because of it.  The main character is a fallen agent who is brought back into the fold, to go after his former mentor who has gone rogue.  Kit Harrington's main motivation to succeed in bring in his former boss is to learn the truth as to what happened to his father mainly how and why he died.  What follows is a journey across Europe with betrayal's, terrorists, explosions, a little banality, and of course the entire agency  So if you are looking for a Kit Harrington middling romp, or are a fan of the show Spooks, check it out, if not might want to skip it.",1466294400,,1025,4.307291666666667

The story is good and it's fun to see London, Berlin, etc.  I hope they make more of these - Kit Harrington is a wonderful addition to MI-5, and I hope they use him again.  Peter Firth reprised his role as Harry; it would be great to bring back some of the other spooks from the TV show.",1466208000,,385,3.961038961038961
7513686,4,B017RR6JYE,"This film is filled with suspense, double-cross, and our lack of knowledge as to who is the good guys and who the bad. A hardened terrorist is freed during a transport to jail. It is obvious that the terrorists had help from inside MI5. One of the leaders of MI5 goes off in search of who that person is. If he is unable to find the person, the Americans will take over MI5. He gets a man whom he dismissed from MI5 to help him. There are lots of twists in the film and lots of questions that need to be answered and are not answered until the end. Who helped the terrorists? Why was the man kick out of MI5? How did this man's father die? Is the man who is going after the terrorist a good guy?
What the film makes clear is that MI5 performs many acts that the average person would consider wrong, even terrible - they believe, in the film, that the end justifies the means - which includes killing innocent people.",1465862400,2,916,4.1807909604519775

7513688,4,B017RR6JYE,"Indian director Bharat Nalluri (Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, Tsunami: The Aftermath, The Crow: Salvation, and episodes of the original television version of MI5 from which this film is adapted) has created a fine extended version of the MI-5 series as written by Jonathan Brackley, Sam Vincent, and David Wolstencroft. One of the reasons the film works well is the competent set of actors who manage to make this rather meandering story hold together and offer enough back stories of each character to make them credible.

When a terrorist (Elyes Gabel) escapes custody during a routine handover, Will Holloway (Kit Harrington) must team with disgraced MI5 Intelligence Chief Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) to track him down before an imminent terrorist attack on London. Or to be more precise, MI5 personnel are caught up in a traffic jam in London while escorting the CIA's most wanted terrorist to an arranged CIA handover point, when he is suddenly rescued by armed men on motorbikes. Harry Pearce, the head of Counter-Terrorism at MI5 is blamed for the terrorist escaping. Especially as Harry disappeared shortly after the incident. An ex-agent, Will Holloway, and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Harry's is recalled by MI5 to assist in finding and bringing Harry in. However Harry has disappeared for a reason. Certain that there is a traitor in a senior position in MI5, he enlists the somewhat reluctant Will to help him in uncovering the rat or rats concerned.

The action is fast and hard and very cleverly captured by cinematographer Hubert Yaczanowski. The large cast of characters includes Larissa Kouznetsova, Laura Pulver, Tim McInnerny, Jennifer Ehle, David Harewood, Tuppence Middleton, and the above mentioned Kit Harrington, Elyes Gable, and Peter Firth. For the popular idiom of spy thrillers this film stands its own  and is much better than many of the same genre. Grady Harp, June 16",1465430400,2,1898,5.135922330097087

7513733,2,B017RR6JYE,I was a major fan of the tv show. The film I have issues with. How did Mace come back from prison which everyone at Kudos and the writers forgot about s5 of the show? What was the purpose of killing off two more characters from the show that being Erin and Cal? I thought the plot was very basic like that of a throwaway episode of the show. Thanks for bringing up an old bitter spot to us fans with Ruth which I still say she could have survived. This could have been so much better. Only thing good about this film Harry Pearce who seemed to have gone back to his old ways of dealing with a problem on his own and Malcolm was back to help out.,1464307200,,645,3.9692307692307693

7513774,4,B017RR6JYE,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I went in watching the movie this movie having no concept of the series on which it was based, SPOOKS, that ran from 2002-11 in Britain. The good news is that you don't have to be aware of that series or its characters. This film picks up with at least one but gives you enough information to stand on its own.

Under Intelligence Chief Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) terrorist Adam Qasim (Elyes Gabel) is being transferred into the custody of the CIA when the convoy is attacked. Rather than jeopardize lives in the process Pearce tells his team to stand down and Qasim escapes. As if that weren't enough, Pearce disappears shortly thereafter making it seem as if he was involved.

Rather than be left with egg on their face MI-5 calls in ex-agent Will Holloway (Kit Harrington) to locate and take down Pearce. As a protg to the now missing Pearce, MI-5 feels that he will know better than anyone how to find him. With a grudge against Pearce as well, since it was he who took him out of MI-5, Will has every reason in the world to want to take on the task.

The two eventually meet early on and Will discovers there was a reason for Pearce disappearance. Pearce has discovered there is a mole in MI-5, an operative who seems more than happy to create a reason to bring the entire group down. While the risk Pearce took in the release of a known terrorist was high, the chance of ferreting out the mole was worth it to him. Now he must convince Will to help him discover who that person is.

Playing against MI-5 while making it seem that he is indeed looking for Pearce is not an easy task but Will is up for it. As he tracks down the suspects and works to find the traitor, Pearce lends a hand when and where he can. It eventually leads to a showdown with Qasim who is little more than a pawn being used by the mole. As Qasim plans a massive siege on the city of London with bombs planted in various locations, the final discovery is made as to the identity of the mole.

The movie works well on many levels. Rather than the suave and always calm Bond style of spy were used to seeing from England we here have a disheveled looking spy in the form of Will who doesnt know all, isn't equipped with the toys Bond has and yet is just as if not more capable to handle most situations. Will is what you would expect a real spy to be like and Pearce as his mentor is a character that knows how to deal with the duplicitous nature of the job.

Firth is comfortable in the role of Pearce as he well should be having played the part in the series. Hes a spy whos gotten older, seen far too much and while perhaps weary of the tasks at hand is always willing to do his all for Queen and country. Harrington does a great job here as Will. Known mostly for his work on GAME OF THRONES its nice to see him in something else and able to prove hes more than just worth being regarded for that alone.

On the whole this was a fun movie to watch, a more thought provoking spy film than many and one that I would love to see carry on with sequels though Im guessing it won't happen unfortunately. Then again after the initial rise of the Bond films who would have thought wed see sequels to movies like THE IPCRESS FILES back in the day. This one is worth watching.",1462752000,2,3302,4.2136075949367084

The plot is fairly weak and the focus is on trying to make a British action movie, rather than a thinking persons spy movie. The acting is okay, but the reluctant hero plot line a bit obvious.

About 5 min in I knew this was not mission impossible because I had not seen Cruise yet and knowing his ego figured he would never let that happen. I also had never heard of the British TV series that this was apparently based on so my mentality at that point was that it was going to be pretty awful and a quick cash grab by cloning the Mission Impossible franchise. Yes, I went into this movie with a closed mind.

The movie turned out to be pretty good actually. Not amazing but pretty good. There were one or two eye rolling plot shortcut moments but all in all they did a good job at packing a lot of story into the runtime. They also kept a pretty decent balance between action and intrigue.

He knows there is a mole, so he goes off the grid and calls in those he can trust to trap the mole risking lives for the ""greater good.""

This was an excellent film with enough twists to keep it interesting without acting overly clever. The plot is different from other spy thrillers. If I had one criticism it was the token hot Asian chick (Eleanor Matsuura) was not a martial arts fighter.

7514514,4,B017RR6JYE,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

OkI confess:  one of my primary reasons for wanting to watch MI-5 was because of Kit Harington, AKA Jon Snow on GAME OF THRONES.  Im not crushing on the guy or anything, but I really like his character in GoT, so I was curious as to how he would do in other roles.  Im happy to report hes just as good here as he is on The Wall.  And in addition to the great acting, MI-5 is a compelling thriller full of twists and turns.  If you're a fan of spy movies, youll definitely want to check out this film for sure.

I am not familiar with the show MI-5, but from what I understand, the movie is a nice compliment to it.  Peter Firth stars in the show as well, but Harington's character is new.  I plan on catching up on the series soon, and I hope it is as entertaining as the film.

MI-5 is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The production value seems high, and I had no problems with anything regarding the sets or filming locales.  While not a huge-budgeted picture, I would assume it was modest nonetheless.

As mentioned above, the acting in MI-5 is very good.  In addition to Harington and Firth, the cast is highlighted by Elyes Gabel, also a GAME OF THRONES alumni.  Gabel portrays the villain, Qasim, and does a fine job.  Whereas many baddies are one-dimensional, Gabel brings depth to the character and, in turn, creates a villain you almost feel sorry for.

There aren't many special effects in MI-5, but the film doesnt need many.  This is not a Bond film, with gadgets and explosions galore.  This is a more realistic thriller that focuses on tension and intrigue over gizmos.  Dont get me wrong:  I love Bond, too.  But MI-5 cannot be classified in the same genre.

My sole complaint about the film is that it feels a bit rushed in places.  Holloways background is a bit hazy, as is the relationship he shares with Firths character.  You can get by with making assumptions during the film, and eventually several things are answeredbut fleshing them out and making the film ten minutes longer would not have hampered it in the least.

Still, MI-5 is a big win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.  Fans of spies and espionage should feel right at home with this one.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1455667200,,2308,4.367058823529412

7514518,1,B017RR6JYE,"I rented this for John Snow of course. Wow, it is so bad. It has nothing to do with the low budget, which is probably low even for a TV show in the U.S...so that means it's really low for a film. My guess is that the production budget was under $2M. To put that in perspective, the production budget of ""24: Live Another Day"" was like $5M per episode. The reason it's terrible is that the writing is absolutely atrocious. I could have written something better if they gave me 1 month...I would have written something pathetic of course, but it would have still been better than what you have in this film.

They have the actors doing and saying things that are completely nonsensical. I was left dumbfounded after virtually every line of dialogue. The directing and/or acting was also awful.

My questions for the other reviewers is why did you give it 2 or 3 stars if you thought it was bad....also, how could this film ever earn 5 stars from anyone other than a studio plant?",1455494400,,977,4.4222222222222225

7514594,2,B017RR6JYE,"Clearly a British undertaking, as it gets going along. If you're looking for some real action, this film doesn't have it. I'm not talking about over-the-top 80's Stallone style - I'm simply talking about real action that matches the story at hand. The protagonist is far from being (and appearing to be) a man who is capable in any way of handling himself. If the fights weren't staged for him to win (as they are in this movie), he'd be spending his life in a constant beat down. Just not a person with the stature you can take seriously.

On the story line side, the ultimate 'insider' traitor was glaringly obvious from the beginning. I'll spare you on the details, in case you wish to snooze through this movie also. The one quality scene is near the end, and involves a poisoning. It's well handled, well acted on both parts.

Overall - a lame story, not really full of any surprises, but filled with lots of actors who simply don't look (or act) the parts they're portraying.",1455235200,,981,4.536723163841808

With the writing, acting and directing that made the series so superb, MI-5 delivers a taut, suspenseful espionage thriller, with twists and turns and a good, solid story - not gimmick filled and over-the-top like the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible movies, but more like the spy films of old, like The Ipcress File, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and 3 Days of the Condor.

If you like spy mystery movies then you should like this movie, if however you are looking for an action movie then you would be disappointed. There are no intricate shoot-em-ups and no intricate fight scenes.
What this movie has is an excellent story with surprises along the way and very difficult to predict what is going to happen next. That alone sets it apart from most similar spy movies.

If you are into all of that CGI stuff, watch something else. In a word this is more credible to a larger degree and it was not designed to appeal to pubescent thinkers with short attention spans. They probably made little money on this movie, because it won't appeal to the lower end of the viewer market. I also liked the fact that the production team didn't waste my viewing time inject all of the obligatory politically correct crap....i.e., obligatory homosexual relationship, obligatory ""all corporations and governments are evil"", mankind is evil and bad for the earth, obligatory interracial relationship, etc. Instead of injecting a bunch of PC fluff, the directors focused on building a twisting plot. If you are into vilography, you won't like this move so much because it is limited to a couple of terrorist shootings....so compared to most of the vilography being produced in this genre, this is very mild...certainly not a collectible for vilography fans.",1451520000,13,1131,4.98941798941799

7514903,4,B017RR6JYE,"I don't know why there are so many ho-hum reviews about the film.  I am a big Spooks fan, and was very excited when I heard they were filming a movie.  I was quite disappointed when it never came to US theaters, but very happy when it became available through Amazon video.

I loved Peter Firth in the tv series and he was just as good in this movie.  A couple of times he employed the same tricks he did in a couple of the shows - I liked that.  Loved that they brought back Malcolm.  Liked to see Oliver Mace taking on a larger role.  Really liked just about all the acting.  It wasn't too violent.  I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat, but that also could be due to the fact that all of the characters from the show that I cared about were already dead!

Don't let the negative reviews stop you.  I watched it twice in one day and enjoyed it very much.",1451433600,4,859,4.023668639053255

7514949,5,B017RR6JYE,"Shame on you all. Idiots. If you are truly (as I am) such Mission Impossible fans - you would have KNOWN this was not one in that series.
This is (as was the series, ""MI-5"" aka ""Spooks"") a masterful exercise in intrigue and intelligence, with a healthy dose of the thin fine line in moral judgments. It uses top notch actors, smart dialog, and twists where you expect turns. Instead of gratuitous explosions and blood-letting (although it does contain an appropriate amount of such) there is intelligence and (weirdly, for a stint in the spy world) compassion.

I had always recommended the show to others, describing it as playing as if it were several mini spy films end to end. Yes, it was quite enjoyable to stumble across this and re-visit the series in such a grand way. (Only quite sad about Ruth character - but it made perfect sense to use her in this fashion.) Why not re-boot it with Kit Harrington (& bring back ""Tom"" in some way)? Harrington seems ever so perfect for a spy. (No, I do not watch GOT, but kill his character off already so he can do FILMS) Not to mention quite finely chiseled acting chops for someone so adept at an action movie. Why yes - he absolutely sizzles in general - kind of glad he downplayed his good looks - so it would not distract the storyline.",1451174400,7,1287,4.453389830508475

Makes me angry when the rating system is used this way. Everyone else gives a thoughtful rating after watching the movie and then you've got 5 people with 1 star and a 1 sentence review ""This movie sucked cause I thought I was buying Mission Impossible 5!"" Which is even FUNNIER, because Mission Impossible 5 isn't even CALLED Mission Impossible 5. It's called Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.
So, in closing, I'm going to watch this movie, then give it the fairest rating I can give. AND to everyone else out there EITHER:

Thank you for taking the time to read the product descriptions before buying something, then afterwards giving a fair rating based on the products ACTUAL merits!

OR blame YOURSELF for your accidental $10.00 waste of a purchase because you were paying attention NOT the movie; therefore making it harder for others to be introduced to something they might like because of a faulty rating you helped contribute to. I suggest in the future:
1) Turn off your 1-click purchase settings
2) Pay attention to what you are purchasing by reading the product description
3) If the statement ""I was in the park one day wondering why frisbees got bigger as they closer, then it hit me."" doesn't make sense, stay away from the shiny star buttons :D

Ok done ranting! Sorry about that, I just got tired of seeing yet another movie/product unfairly rated.

American has done nothing except work hard to undermine the UK since WWII. Anyhow, fortunately for fans of the series, this is a reprise of the best of MI-5 packed into a feature film. Obviously this limits the plot development and stretches credulity a little, however it remains a huge amount of fun. especially for fans of the original series. Truth is, America has all but destroyed the UK with the able assist of Prime Ministers such as Tony Blair (a CIA recruit from college) and others in technology and defense who were bribed to shoot Britain in the foot at every opportunity.

7515099,4,B017RR6JYE,"This review is of the movie know as MI-5 aka Spooks:The Greater Good in the UK. It is your mission to read this review and choose whether or not to accept the task of viewing this movie. This movie is a film adaptation of the British TV series Spooks. The events in this movie take place a few years after the ending of the Spooks 10 series run. Like the show, the movie revolves around the UK organization MI-5. The British organization the deals with national security usually pertaining  to threats within the UK's borders. This organization employees spies, which are the central characters in this movie. So basically this is a spy movie, but if your looking to find James Bond or Mission Impossible similarities they are few and far between. The main difference between those franchises and this film are the series Spooks/MI-5 tend to be a little more grounded in reality. That being said, after watching the 10 series and the movie their were quite a bit of unbelievable things that happened. Although I would call it a heightened reality. In Bond and Mission Impossible clearly much of the tradecraft and happenings were just not possible although they were entertaining. Also if your looking for something similar to Tinker Toy Solider Spy it doesn't quite hit the mark. I would say its like a fusion of the franchises mentioned above. If you have the time I would recommend watching all 10 series of the Spooks/MI-5 series and then view the movie. But if you don't desire to or have the time to do that I still recommend checking out MI-5 as a standalone movie. I currently reside in the states and had to wait about 7 months to finally get to see this movie since its initial release. I must say I was not let down. I believe if you like the Spy/Spy thriller genre you should enjoy this movie. If your only exposure to the genre is films like Bond and Mission Impossible you may not care for this film. But you might. Oh and one other thing Jon Snow from Game Of Thrones is in the film. He knows something in this film. :) You have now been briefed about the film MI-5/Spooks:The Greater Good. You now have a choice to make. You can do good or you can well.",1449964800,28,2169,4.491139240506329

7515104,4,B017RR6JYE,"I watched this last night, and in reading the three reviews here as of early December 2015, I was disappointed by how shallow they were about this fine movie.

First of it is worth understanding that Mi-5 as portrayed in this film is based on an original British TV show called ""Spooks"" or ""Mi-5"" in the U.S.  So coming at this movie having already watched several seasons of that great Brit spy thriller series was a great advantage.  It gives you a deeper view of character if you are armed with that character back story when trying to understand the Mi-5 master Harry Pearce.  If you watch the counter-terror American-Brit show ""Strike Back"" - - what's better, watching the finale of season-five by itself, or having seen the five seasons already before and then watching the S5 Finale?

Second, this is a very entertaining spy-thriller and conspiracy movie - - with more twists and turns than an Irish country road.  I mean, that ending when... OH, sorry, I won't give that away, or any of the other four or five WHAT!? moments when what you think proves wrong, someone is a betrayer or working for the other side.

Third, this film does a great job in limited time provided by a movie of showing the moral conflicts and moral choices some of the characters are faced with making and the dilemmas their lives are tossed into by the spy work they do.  What is the greater good?  Do the means justify the ends, or is that just ""situational ethics"" untethered by any solid principles?

Fourth, there is a good mix of the now in-demand Millennial gen actors combined and balanced by a few end of career, 60-something, former fighting Ivan, Cold War warriors who have seen and done everything already twice.  Instead of trying to package the movie only for 20-30 somethings because they are the large, current viewing target audience - - this film shows the real world, all ages acting in concert.  This is a refreshing change of pace, because by age 30, no, you are by no stretch of the imagination close to being seasoned, high-experienced or in a position to be in some of the roles in society that moviemakers now try to plop Millenial actors into today.

Lastly, the action sequences and shoot-em up scenes are masterfully done, Goldilocks-style; no to much, not too little, just right.

I recommend this movie for pure entertainment value and all the other reasons ennumerated above.",1449705600,105,2389,4.697841726618705
