8406542,5,B003VADSSW,Just what I expected from memory some 40 years ago. Lovely Katherine Ross. Completely opposite looks from actresses we have now. We have better looking maids back home.,1396137600,,168,5.035714285714286
8406543,3,B003VADSSW,"this is a corny campy piece of crap picture that is so stupid the only redeeming thing about the film is that it is filmed in san francisco and has local actors in it . it is trying to be an art film but fails miserably the acting by Jason robards is very good and Katherine ross is not bad and not good either she tromps around in a sweater with no bottom on to add sex appeal the dialogue is jumbled , and the only thing that is good about it is that it was filmed in san Francisco and shows the city in the early seventies ...most of it is long gone",1395273600,,552,3.8508771929824563
8406544,5,B003VADSSW,"Hi.
This seems to be a wonderful picture.
 And I just ant to say. I think all movies should go Blu- Because I love the Blu-Ray format.
And I want all of my movies on Blu-Ray.
Blu-Ray is  a superior format.
It's pretty much the only format I buy now.",1385078400,,249,3.96
