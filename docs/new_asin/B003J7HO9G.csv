4129281,5,B003J7HO9G,i bought this dvd and another caillou dvd for a 5 hr plane ride. My son loved both of these dvds he cant get enough caillou. he dances every time it comes on,1301788800,,157,3.787878787878788
4129282,5,B003J7HO9G,"My almost-four-year-old granddaughter can't get enough Caillou!  She has loved him and his family for over two years now.  She doesn't mind watching the same two DVDs over and over again, but I needed a change, since I had the dialogue from our first two memorized!  We were all thrilled that this DVD does NOT have the puppets that bothered her so much on some other DVDs.  She even commented that he seems to have grown up a little and acts more like ""a big boy"" now.  We catch Caillou every chance we get on Sprout TV, but the DVDs are great to have on hand when traveling, or when it's three more hours before Sprout has him scheduled.",1299715200,29,639,4.336134453781512

4129286,5,B003J7HO9G,"It's a most recent version of Caillou, which my little one (22mos) loves. The earlier versions of Caillou show the tantrums of the main character, which I try to avoid as my little one likes to imitate.",1285027200,14,202,4.486486486486487
4129287,5,B003J7HO9G,"I think this is awesome. It's the only Caillou dvd we own...atleast until todays order comes in. We watch Caillou on PBS Sprout every night but this was a purchase I made for a recent trip we took and I'm so happy I did. It was nice to have a video with us that we could tolerate in the car. My kids are 1 and 3 so they don't use headphones yet. Caillou is so sweet and not a brat in this video. Love it! My daughter has learned so much watching him and you can really see it when she plays by herself (well with her imaginary friends- all are named from characters on Caillou). Would recommend it, even giving at a bday gift this weekend :)",1282003200,12,641,4.015625

4129304,5,B003J7HO9G,"If you've ever watched Caillou over & over, you're familiar with all the episodes...so pretty much these are all repeats, some with the earlier ""whiny"" Caillou & some with the later ""matured"" Caillou. However, there are NO puppets, which is what I was looking for..yay! There's opening credits from the earlier show with them but they DO NOT make an appearance AT ALL. There are ads for other DVDs at the start of the DVD but what DVD doesn't have that. The only way to bypass them is fast forward. Before the episode starts, of course they include the PBS Kids sponsor acknowledgement for Chuck E Cheese like they do on the station. Unfortunately you can't skip it; no biggie, it doesn't last long or you can fast forward. I'm happy with this purchase & happy my 2 year old will be happy with her favorite show.",1412467200,2,812,4.530612244897959

4129309,2,B003J7HO9G,"I purchased this so I can have consecutive Caillou shows for my daughter to watch while we cuddle or relax before bed.  This one has a Chuck E Cheese commercial between each show.  It's loud and obtrusive.  It must be the PBS videos that are like that because I have another one that does the same thing.  You can't even skip it.
When it's on tv it's fine to have commercials but when I've just paid for something I don't want an annoying Chuck E Cheese commercial interrupting the flow.  I didn't pay so I could be advertised to.",1392854400,6,530,4.313131313131313

I would like to know where the one I already ordered and paid for is?,1376006400,,385,3.948717948717949
4129318,1,B003J7HO9G,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.
