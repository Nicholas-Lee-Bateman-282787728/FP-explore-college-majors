7899186,2,6306012281,I wanted this movie because Shiri was in it. She of course did excellent in the acting. The other people in it were somewhat disappointing. I prefer Bedazzled over this movie.,1361232000,,175,4.67741935483871

7899188,3,6306012281,I got this movie because it was cheap and I'm a big fan of Shiri Appleby from the show Roswell. This is one of those movies were you really need to be a fan of one of the actors to enjoy it.,1310688000,2,190,3.5476190476190474
7899189,3,6306012281,Shiri Appleby is the only reason I bought this movie.  As usual Shiri turns in a great performance.  Just not enough scenes with her in it.,1123718400,2,139,4.3076923076923075
7899190,3,6306012281,"This film has all the elements, cute actors like Shiri Appleby (which was the only reason I bought the film Ha!) All and all the acting is rather bad, Kevin Pollak was terrible, and Michael Goorigian look far too sensible to be the averrage high school geek. This film was too predictable with Henry getting the girl at the end, but my didn't they look good together.
If you are thinking of buying this film, don't,unless your a big fan of Roswell Hign (Shiri Appleby), or Party Of Five (Michael Goorgian).
I rate it three stars because Shiri Appleby shined this average low budget film up.",992131200,13,590,4.5754716981132075
7899191,5,6306012281,"AMAZING.
Shiri Appleby's break-out movie.  What an actress, the movie stinks, but hey... cant win 'em all.
Buy this movie in bulk.  They are going fast!!!",973036800,4,154,4.884615384615385
