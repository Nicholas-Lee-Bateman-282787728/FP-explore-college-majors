8616045,1,B00FJC871I,A group of us from my art association watched the DVD at our monthly meeting.  We all agreed the presentation was really poor. Words appeared on the TV screen without the pictures.  The paintings then occured with all these lines in different shapes and forms. We found it very confusing and not professionally done.  Everyone asked if I could return it.  Your policy states I can't return it if I opened it.  I just won't buy another DVD from Amazon.  You're review made it sound wonderful but it was not.,1392076800,11,506,4.566666666666666
8616046,5,B00FJC871I,"John Singer Sargent Revealed. During a lecture at the New Britain Museum of American Art  a few years back, I heard a lecture given by Jason Alster M.Sc on John Singer Sargent. I learned from the talk that Sargent was both a methodical and detailed artist. Jason at the time mentioned that he decoded some of the mysteries around Sargent's paintings that he encountered. For instance why the Daughters' of Darley Boit were separated and the painting had a void. Also, he talked about Madame X and why Sargent  was critiqued for his painting of  her. He also suggested and showed that Sargent was ahead of his time and used Gestalt techniques of optical illusion as well as integrating classical and modern styles. Alster mentioned that he was a pastel artist and not originally interested in Sargent , but this project given to him by the museum made him interested in Sargent because he wanted to try and solve the mysteries even further. In his new video I found that Alster kept his word and delivered bringing new insights into the painting style of Sargent. I never understood why Sargent was considered such a great American and international artist until I heard his lecture and further saw this video. The video lecture was well designed in that it built up the mysteries in a stepwise fashion so that any art lover could appreciate without having a degree in art. I myself had been to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts too where many of the paintings of Sargent reside and the mysteries are told by the docents. So I can truthfully say that Alster really does seem to decode the mysteries. In any case my appreciation of Sargent's art has significantly increased . This video would be great for art educators, painters interested in design ,  and art lovers alike.",1385596800,5,1770,4.7
