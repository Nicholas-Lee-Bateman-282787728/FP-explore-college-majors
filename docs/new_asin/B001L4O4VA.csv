3678473,5,B001L4O4VA,"I just purchased this collection for my daughter, and I am not disappointed!  We already owned the Ezra Jack Keat's Neighborhood story collection, and I remember seeing several of the stories themselves once or twice when I was a child, so I knew about what to expect, but after watching them through, I am even more pleased with them.  The artwork comes directly from the book- there is no alteration or ""interpretation""- and is very soothing to watch.  The narration and the music composed for the pieces are both calming as well.  There is an option to ""read along"" on screen, and there are even spanish versions of two of the stories (The Snowy Day and Whistle for Willie).

My daughter is 3 1/2 and it seems that most programming for people her age is either loud (why does everyone yell in children's shows these days?), exciting and even obnoxious, or dumbed down to a ridiculous extent.  This collection is neither.  It is artistic, thoughtful and calming.  Perfect for before bedtime viewing (my daughter fell asleep during the last story).  The stories depict children of all races in a lovely way, and there is no marketing pitch like everything on tv today.  I would highly recommend this video to parents looking for a calm, thoughtful alternative to today's children's programming.",1298937600,8,1295,4.845454545454546
3678474,5,B001L4O4VA,"My boys are huge fans of the Keats collection.  These stories appear on another Scholastic disc, which I purchased for my older son some years back.  He watched it over and over until his little brother lost the disc.  We ordered this one, and now they watch this version over and over again.",1276300800,,292,4.471698113207547
8317225,5,B001L4O4VA,"I love Keats' stories, and these videos pay homage to his writing. They leave the original text and ""feel"" of the story intact by using the actual illustrations as the animations. I will enjoy this DVD with my daughter for years to come.",1495497600,,237,4.534883720930233

8317233,5,B001L4O4VA,"My kids are five years old and they love Ezra Jack Keats. I saw the DVD and my children were excited.  They watched for the mail everyday. When the DVD came they ran upstairs to play it. We have all the books except for one on the DVD.  They read his books over and over again. Since the DVD, they read them two and three times a day.  The artwork makes it so real for them. I am really glad I purchased the DVD, only which I saw it in the begining of the school year when they starting reading his books. They love his books.",1369699200,,526,3.943396226415094
8317234,5,B001L4O4VA,"Ezra Jack Keats writes wonderful stories for ALL children (and grownups who love children).  I bought the collection for my granddaughter and even before she saw the video, she was thrilled to pieces to have the DVD because she had ""Snowy Day"" in her book collection.  After I watched ""Snowy Day"" with her, she was told by her Dad that she had to come eat.  She was devastated.  She wanted to watch ""Whistle for Willie"" and everything else on the menu.  I was very sad to have to back up her Daddy's orders because I knew how badly she felt, and I wanted to watch the others too!!  Thank you, Ezra Jack Keats, for wonderful stories.",1348790400,,632,4.405172413793103
