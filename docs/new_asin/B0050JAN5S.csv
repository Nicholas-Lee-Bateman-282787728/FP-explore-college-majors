4514608,5,B0050JAN5S,"When I found out the subject matter of this film, frankly, I wasn't really interested. But filmmaker Ian Palmer's work is truly incredible, as he captured the spirit and depth of these ""fists of fury."" ""Knuckle"" is an outstanding documentary, given the subject matter. One note: you'd think if these folks could muster the tens of thousands of pounds to bet on these fights, they could use some of the money to settle their differences in a peaceful manner!",1326758400,4,457,4.7974683544303796
4514609,4,B0050JAN5S,"Knuckle is an interesting view into a world unknown to me.  I had talked with a few coworkers who had worked in England for some time and they had described this Irish Traveler culture to me.  I found this film to really fit the bill of showing this community from the inside.  Their culture promotes fighting (bare knuckle fighting as the title does imply), to solve differences between families.  This is not a movie for children, or those who do not want to see physical violence or blood.  Take this R rating seriously.  There are multiple scenes where real bare knuckle fighting takes place, and people get bloody in most.  The rules are simple, two men fight until one get's knocked out, or someone's said they've had enough.  Often times there are 10s of thousands of pounds on the line for the big fights.  Only punching is allowed and if someone is knocked down, they cannot be hit until they are back up.  Some of the video in this movie is not the highest resolution, but it does the job.  It's real life.  For movie buffs, this is the reality of Brad Pitt's character (Mickey O'Neil) in Guy Ritchie's film Snatch.",1324512000,6,1125,4.54228855721393

4514611,4,B0050JAN5S,"As a child, John Paul Moorehouse (John Connors) watched his father get killed in a drive by. The culprit was never found. He was raised by his uncle to be a fighter. The Moorehouse family is involved in a feud with the Powers clan who far outnumber them. Their lands are separated by private property whose owner is not keen on trespassers.

As you may have guessed John Paul has a love interest in the Powers clan, Winnie (Carla McGlynn) someone he knew as a child.

The film is an interesting look at the Travellers who marry young in prearranged marriages and not always by the wishes of the bride. The sound track for this film is diverse with traditional songs being used as well as Johnny Cash and contemporary music. I was most intrigued by the old photos during the opening credits.

The film didn't have much linear plot movement. It consisted of back and forth between the families. I enjoyed the characters, dialogue, and occasional humor.

4514612,4,B0050JAN5S,"This is a great film if you like the documentary style, because that's what it is.  No effects, reenactments or stunt-doubles.  Just raw film and good editing of men who live to fight.  A great gift for the person who likes fighting, combat and roudy fun.",1361836800,,255,4.5
4514613,2,B0050JAN5S,"Two hours of watching what in America would be called White Trash slug each other and perpetuate a meaningless feud.  It's depressing to watch and the film-maker, to his credit, expresses incredulity at his own interest in these people, who are not interesting.  Then again, I did finish watching this.

Also, these guys can't fight their way out of a paper bag.  A 16 year old Golden Glover would make mincemeat out of any of them.",1358467200,3,432,4.644736842105263

To follow the Quinn-McDonough(?) Family around for ten years is freaking awesome. I understand the concept Of settling feuds by fighting rather than all Out war, but its a bit sad to see 60 year Old grandfathers duking it Out. The drunken YouTube videos just add fuel to the fire. I felt very drawn towards James, whom the video focuses On. It seems as though he would like to escape the madness but keeps getting dragged back in in Order to protect his families name.

4514618,4,B0050JAN5S,"This is a hard documentary to judge, Ian Palmer spent twelve years on and off filming the ongoing feud between rival clans of travellers - the sad fact is that they are all related. The main character is James Quinn-MacDonnagh, he seems to be unbeatable and is therefore the subject of most invitations to fight. The feuding has been going on for some time and they are reluctant to talk about the past, but eventually do.

Palmer first met them when he was videoing one of their weddings, he then got invited to record a fight. These fights take place away from the families to avoid an all out riot and are refereed by a third family to ensure it is a fair fight. Joe Joyce seems to be the main protagonist and does come across as a man who will never quite grow up, the language and attitude is quite often only comparable to that of the playground. One of the reasons that Michael gives for continuing to return to the `ring' or more accurately waste land/car park, is the purse which is quite considerable, and they do seem to attempt to drink the majority of it as soon as possible.

A fight is only ended with a knock out or a submission or a draw. This means a fight can go on for hours - with no comfort breaks. They also make insulting videos which they send to each other to encourage, - you guessed it, yet more fights. Whilst this behaviour is basically feral the insults lack imagination too, with such heinous rebukes as `baldy b@stard' and `monkeys' - that's enough to make anyone want to go for three hours bare knuckle wrangling in a pub car park.

Palmer attempts to bring in judgement which for a documentary is probably off the scale; even the music is all sad and regretful, a bit like the end music to `The Incredible Hulk'. He interviews some of the women who more or less think it should stop, he shows the children at the age of seven already looking forward to having a go themselves, that is a better way to juxtapose what is happening elsewhere on screen. There are some who will criticise this for what it leaves out, like the social damage that traveller's life style costs the more fixed population, but that is not the subject of Palmers' film, and he does say at one point he was wearying of the whole thing. However, it holds together really well, it is both human and illuminating; it is also violent, juvenile and sad.

Partly sponsored by the Irish Film Board, this runs for an hour and a half; there is interest from HBO to make this into a series, so there is a lot to warrant merit here, I just found it very hard to actually `like', it is also sub titled but I did not need them and it can be seen as a bit insulting, after all they are speaking English albeit with a strong accent. Still all in all Palmer should be praised for his efforts, I just wonder at this as being sold as a fight fest when it should be more social commentary.",1341878400,,2877,4.322222222222222
4514619,4,B0050JAN5S,"Welcome to modern-day Ireland's version of the Hatfield and McCoy family dispute. Everything about this tale of interfamilial feuding speaks to the quaint, the bizarre,the nasty, the complex and humorous in human relations. The two parties in this on-going squabble are the Joyces from near Dublin and the Quinns from around Dundalk. These two clans are connected through marriages over the past fifty years and are part of that growing community of itinerant workers and families called travellers or gypsies(not Romany)who live in caravans or bungalows. The filmmaker, in this film, documents both where the bad blood between these two interrelated groups originated and how and why they choose to keep it going trough succeeding generations. Gradually, the story comes out that the initial incident happened in England on a job site years ago when a family member of the Joyces was killed by somebody from the Quinns in a bitter argument, and nobody has since found in his heart the need to forgive. As far as blood feuds go, this one has an interesting twist to it: every year, the hatred and tension between the two warring groups is worked out in bare-knuckle fights convened on back country roads between hand-picked champions. While stakes are high(thousands of dollars plus bragging rights) the quality of pugilism is akin to lampoonish barroom brawling that amounts at best to clutching, grabbing, biting, kneeing, and scratching. Lots of fun in watching grown men act like silly toddlers over issues that have no bearing in reality. The director Palmer does a marvellous job getting inside this dysfunctional community to determine what makes them tick.",1340064000,,1664,5.166666666666667

8451282,4,B0050JAN5S,"I was wary of the of the 2011 documentary ""Knuckle,"" assumed to be yet another examination of man's brutality. What I discovered was a fascinating study of tribal humanity. Please note, this is a violent film inappropriate for children or impressionable young teens.

I have read much on the Native Americans who once roamed the U.S. plains for untold years. The nomads' favorite pastime was to raid neighboring tribes to steal women and horses. Occasionally they would count coup, and sometimes, though this was not the norm, they would kill a warrior. For years afterwards they would regale these raids around campfires and then the following evening, go on yet another raid. I was reminded of this tradition when watching ""Knuckle.""

Ireland's traveler clans (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irish-Travellers-Tinkers-No-More/dp/0979013003/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irish Travellers, Tinkers No More</a>) are gypsy-like itinerant groups dating back hundreds of years. They too are nomadic, living in trailers or RVs, moving across the land. They go by the storied names of Yeats, Quinn and McDonagh, oftentimes cousins marrying cousins, as intertwined as the Hatfields and McCoys. Everyone's related and as this documentary shows, feuds run deep and ugly. Scores are settled by bare-knuckle fights held at a desolate crossroads, usually framed by an ancient stone wall covered in moss. The men strip off their shirts to reveal nice beer guts and tattoos, and duke it out for sometimes hours at a time until one quits. It's a bloody mess, though played by a surprisingly set of stringent rules not allowing kicking or biting, with neutral refs continuously screaming ""Break!"" when they grapple from sweaty exhaustion.

The winner becomes a great source of pride for the family, their victory told for months afterwards. These families exchange videos insulting rivals, asking for rematches. As this documentary details, the cycle of feuds goes on for years. Director Ian Palmer stumbled upon these fights when asked to videotape a wedding of a McDonagh in the 1990's. From there, he was asked to film a fight, thus began a decade-long examination of the secretive practices of the Irish traveler clans. He wisely uses subtitles during the film, as the Irish accents are as thick as century-old whiskey.

I had a good friend who viewed this documentary and was repulsed. My response, ""Better fists than guns."" I have no doubt after viewing this film the Irish traveler clans live in essential poverty, and these fights were a form of escape, a way to spice the humdrum existence of an incredibly arduous life. The greatest fault of ""Knuckle,"" operating on a low budget, was a lack of history of the Irish traveler clans in addition to details as to how these people live day to day.

I appreciated Palmer's attempt to get to the root of this feud, and a man lugs out an old suitcase filled with snapshots. It appears one man was accidentally killed after a pub brawl, and another served time in jail for manslaughter, thus the fights began to defend family names.

I couldn't help but recall John Ford's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quiet-Man-60th-Anniversary-Special-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B009YX8LO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quiet Man (60th Anniversary Special Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], taking place in Ireland and starring John Wayne. That film detailed the Irish custom of settling differences with fist-a-cuffs, with Wayne's character, a former boxer having killed a man in the ring, no longer comfortable with violence. As the famous film shows, fighting is ingrained in the Irish culture, a source of pride. While I doubt modern-day Ireland resembles Ford's classic tale, Palmer shows that amidst the country's rural locales these ancient traditions continue. Ultimately, such behavior is a microcosm of nations at war, fighting for untold generations for reasons, hidden in an old suitcase, long forgotten.",1430179200,,4003,5.5220228384991845

8451284,5,B0050JAN5S,"An incredible and interesting movie. If you enjoyed Brad Pitts fictional gypsy  character in ""Snatch"" you will truly enjoy learning about the real travelers who bare knuckle box as a way of life.",1424649600,,195,4.909090909090909
8451285,4,B0050JAN5S,"For me, in order for a documentary to be successful, there are three criteria which must be satisfied:

1. The film must be real and true. That is, objective, above all, not staged. The filmmaker sets up the camera without any preconceived ideas or viewpoint or direction, and starts filming. What we are supposed to end up watching is spontaneous and unpredictable. This is very difficult to do; so often the filmmaker's personal viewpoints become obvious. Images are included or rejected based upon conscious or subconscious biases.

2. The filmmaker must not manipulate or edit the images in order to make a political statement or to persuade us to take a certain philosophical position. Simply viewing the film should be enough for us. Don't try to convince us; just let us judge for ourselves.

3. The subject of the film must be compelling. But this last criteria is probably least important, because some filmmakers have been able to create some unbelievably great documentaries on subjects which, at first glance, seem to be extremely insignificant, or boring, or esoteric.

I found Knuckle to meet all three criteria. I am an older American gent, almost 65, and I know a lot about England and the British Isles. But I've never lived there, only visited. I took a summer-long bicycle trip there years ago and rode through some Romany gypsy camps. There have been a couple of British films--not documentaries--over the years which showed glimpses of the world of the Irish travelers. But Guy Ritchie's Snatch was one of the first that I'd seen which really cast a light upon the culture, particularly the bare knuckle fighting segment. It was so ironic that an American actor, Brad Pitt, was chosen to play the lead fighter, and a true testimonial to his ability that he was able to do such a magnificent job.

As others have stated, this is a glimpse into the rivalry between two Irish traveler clans--another irony is that the two clans are actually related!--the Quinn-McDonaghs, and the Joyce's. Sometime back in the early 1990's, somebody from one family died and somebody from the other family was blamed for causing the death, and thus, a vendetta began. The director spent over a decade filming the clans and filming the fights, which in itself is a testimonial to his dedication and interest in the subject. We get just a bit of history, which I believe is intentional, if only to suggest that the origins of the feud are not all that important to the fellows, who seem much more interested exacerbating things than they are in patching things up. The story focuses on James Quinn-McDonagh, a fairly fit middle-aged man (shown on the cover of the DVD jacket) who over the years, due to his success in fighting, has become something of a legend in the families. Large sums of money are put up as bets on the fights, upwards of 50,000 to 60,000 pounds; the purse for the last fight was in excess of 100,000 pounds! Which in itself is shocking, as most of the men do not seem to hold any kind of jobs....so where do they get the money for their manly activities of drinking, cigs and gambling?

There are several fights shown, and they are real fights, with fists lightly taped. The men get cut, and blood flows. The fighters tend to be overweight and unskilled; I'd hazard that any mediocre MMA fighter would make short work of any one of these guys. One integral part of the whole scheme is the creation of what I'd call ""In Your Face"" videos: after a fight, a family, usually the family of the losing fighter, would film a video where they'd trash members of the other family, hurling insults, bragging, boasting, challenging, calling out the other family. Several times in the film, one guy would say something like, ""things were OK with 'em for a while, but the whole trouble started when they sent that last f*cking video!"" Then yet another fight was scheduled, a location was agreed upon, usually a wide spot in the road, or a parking lot, a list of opponents drawn up, impartial referees lined up. Usually five or six 'bouts' were scheduled. No kicking, biting, or wrestling was allowed (though several fights were stopped due to biting). A key factor was that no clan members were allowed to witness the actual fight, to prevent the outbreak of gang warfare. Cell phones were used to give instantaneous blow-by-blow progress reports to the anxious clan members. Women are almost conspicuous in their absence; the women who do appear do not seem all that thrilled with the Neanderthal behavior of their men.

Big Joe Joyce is the patriarch of the Joyce clan and, despite his age, he has lost none of the anger and fire which lead to these fights. He reminded me of the Victor McLaglen character in the John Wayne film, The Quiet Man. Very mean, nasty, hard-drinking, tough, almost subhuman, and the most recalcitrant and obdurate individual on earth. At one point he actually 'comes out of retirement' to duke it out with a grandfather from the Quinn clan. Both men, oafish, silver-haired, walrus-like, but willing, are shown swinging wildly at each other in a weird, pathetic ballet of geriatric aggression. I was reminded of the Seinfeld episode with an ancient Lloyd Bridges, where he was challenging the much-younger Jerry to a weightlifting contest.

From time immemorial, men--not women, and that is the key; testosterone is critical here--have fought one another over matters large and small and everything in between. It's part of the human male psyche, this compulsion to prove toughness, superiority, and, of course, to impress women. I attended a boys' Catholic high school in the '60's, and we used to have dances (or 'sock hops', as they were known) in the gyms of the various boys and girls Catholic schools. To get into the dance, you had to have a Catholic school ID; if you did not, you could not attend the dance. Evidently, the intent was to keep out the sinful, godless public school riff raff. But inevitably, outside in the parking lot or on the school grounds, fights would break out between gangs of kids from the various schools. If you were caught alone, wearing your school jacket, by a group of guys from another school, you might 'get your ass kicked' quite severely. No weapons were used other than fists and feet. I was not a fighter and did not ever feel compelled to attack a kid just because he went to a different school; perhaps I did not have sufficient levels of testosterone? I could not completely understand why anyone would want to drink so much, and fight so much. If you were not part of this group of aggressive lads, you were almost made to feel inferior or unmanly.

A psychologist might suggest that this aggressive, exaggeratedly 'macho' behavior is characteristically found in young males, who are no longer boys but not quite men. They are eager to prove their manhood and so they act out on what they believe is true-blue, ultra-male behavior. OK, we get it. But once you become a man, aren't you supposed to then relax and dial it back a bit? No, apparently not, if you are a member of one of these clans. We saw the same kind of thing in the British football firms and hooligans of the '70's and '80's: tribal warfare, really, grown men, in their thirties and forties, kicking the stuffing out of each other.

I do not mean to disrespect the Irish here, but perhaps there is something in the personality makeup or DNA of the Irish which predisposes them to (1) drinking; (2) depression (which certainly goes hand-in-hand with #1); (3) fighting; (4) inability to let bygones be bygones.

I know folks of Irish ancestry who are some of the most unforgiving people on earth; they still hold grudges over perceived slights, supposedly committed years and years ago. Could it be that the centuries-old conflict between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland is a byproduct and result of this personality trait? Who knows? On a positive note, the Irish have way more than their share of great writers and dramatists. But wait a minute....DRAMATISTS! That in itself could be indicative of a tendency or preoccupation with self-reflection bordering on self-obsession, to endlessly examine and ruminate and analyze, to blow insignificant events way out of proportion.

Sorry, guess I went off the rails a bit there with reading things into this whole thing; after all, I am part Irish myself.
I highly recommend this movie. It is a very compelling look at a world that, in all likelihood, you would never be able to see.",1406160000,,8484,4.771798365122616
8451286,1,B0050JAN5S,"I thought this would be a compelling film about a traditional, fabled ""traveler"" culture in the Irish isles.  It isn't.  It's a contrived story, basically following around a family of low lifes (I mean real ""trailer trash"" type of people) and melodramatically (and laughably) presenting their conflicts as stories that the viewer should care about.  I stopped sympathizing with the characters two minutes into the film.  Their ""inter-clan"" rivalries are clearly just conflicts between groups of uneducated, boorish people who happen to be in Ireland.  There is no observation of a subculture involved here, at all.  This is not a tale of ancient Irish tradition bleeding into modern times.  It's a tale of a bunch of trashy morons who like to fight, and frankly it could have been set in any country where there are broke, boorish scumbags.  I know that is harsh, but it is frankly all this movie left me with.  One can tell that the filmmaker thought he had something special when he started filming this; he didn't...

FYI, there were YouTube videos of some of these bare-knuckle fights available way before this movie came out.  I remember seeing them.  So the auteur (eye roll) apparently took his project of filming Irish losers fighting in the street and tried to make a compelling documentary out of it.  How do you say ""fail"" in Gaelic?",1405814400,2,1344,4.86784140969163
