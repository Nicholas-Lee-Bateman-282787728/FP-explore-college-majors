It was hilarious to see Marron dressed up as a girl, as well..*covers mouth hurriedly to keep other stuff from spilling  out* I bought this video in a subtitled edition, by the way, and I highly  recommend it.  I don't know what the dubbed version was like but as for the  animation, as always, it is quite high-quality for a TV show.",962928000,,434,4.512820512820513
