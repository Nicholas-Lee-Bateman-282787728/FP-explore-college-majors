7819306,3,630198269X,This is a very good romantic movie.  This and Say Anything are probably my two favorite of these kind of movies.  C. Thomas Howell  is Kelly Prestons's boyfriend.  She is a spoiled girl who is never quite happy with what she has.  After they break up.  Howell through some unforeseen circumstances get's involved with her Mother.  And even being the Mother she still seems to me like she is way out of his league.  This is just a good over all movie.,1522540800,,450,4.402439024390244

7819310,3,630198269X,Not sure if image quality was the tape or my machine.  Have only viewed once so cannot judge.  Will try again on different machine and update my review then.,1376956800,,157,4.379310344827586
7819311,3,630198269X,"What can I say, I'm a real fan of Ann Margret.  The acting wasn't oscar nomination quality but it was a fun movie and Ann Margret would be my dream girl at any age!",1352246400,,164,3.823529411764706
7819312,3,630198269X,The poor quality of the video transfer outweighs any good things I might have to say. It looks like a 5th generation VHS tape that somebody gave you.,1349568000,,149,4.357142857142857
7819313,4,630198269X,"If any of you men have ever loved an older woman, then this is the movie for you...  No, it is not great acting, in fact it is a b-grade movie.  BUT, it shows that real, true love is not about age, it is about the person.  It's high time that women get to relate to younger men, because men have been with younger women forever.

This was purchased through the Marketplace - and the seller from Yazoo City, MS is a fantastic seller!",1314316800,,432,4.107142857142857
7819314,5,630198269X,A good story line with a fine cast made this an outstanding choice.  Ann-margret has turned in another work of art.  I didn't like the scene where the dog got ate but one scene does not spoil a movie.  I would like to see this movie on Blu-ray.,1247184000,,244,4.041666666666667
7819315,5,630198269X,"I found this movie quite by chance in a local video store and decided to see it because Ann-Margret is one of my favorite actresses, not to mention one of the most beautiful women in the world. It also stars the gorgeous Kelly Preston and B-movie king C. Thomas Howell. It starts out as many teen romantic comedies of the '80s, but it has its own flavor and mature themes which make it stand out.
Howell and Preston are boyfriend and girlfriend in smalltown USA. They're about to graduate high school. He wants to go the next level with her, but she's holding back. You get the feeling she's a bit of a shrew as well. Ann-Margret stars as Preston's mom. She has her own baggage with an estranged husband and difficult relationship with her daughter.
After breaking up with Preston, Howell kind of stumbles into a romantic relationship with the Ann-Margret. They feel a strong attraction for each other and consummate their relationship, but it looks like it doesn't have a chance of surviving, what with their age difference and familial scrutiny. Ann-Margret gets pregnant, and how they handle this unplanned event and the future of their relationship is what makes this movie a winner.
There are a number of memorable quirky scenes, like with the pet tiger of the title, and the hilarious outdoors make-out scene with Howell and Ann-Marget when they disturb some wasps. I highly recommend this film.",1070236800,9,1401,4.793388429752066
