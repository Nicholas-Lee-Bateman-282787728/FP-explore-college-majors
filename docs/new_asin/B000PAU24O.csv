8190143,5,B000PAU24O,"This young woman is special.  I find the production very convincing, very powerful, and the film editing contributes to making it more than just a theater performance, although it is very much that.  Polenzani and the Germont pere are good, but Delunsch is out of this world.  Not a conventional voice but miraculously effective.  I don't remember the last time I sat through a whole performance on DVD and couldn't really get away from it.",1430352000,,440,4.826666666666667
8190144,5,B000PAU24O,"Peter Mussbach's Traviata on DVD, as performed in 2003 at the Aix-en-Provence festival promises on its cover the story of a death and love. That is what it delivers. And so much more.

While Willy Decker's Traviata is the last breath in the joy of life, Peter Mussbach's Traviata is one long last breath of death. Gracious Mireille Delunsch is the Violeta. Her lyrical voice of subdued expressiveness and a flavour of fragility convey this agony with searing emotional authenticity. Matthew Polenzani's Alfredo is well nuanced in emotional spectrum and depth. His Alfredo feels almost as equally unfortunate as Violeta and only slightly less tragic remaining throughout, firmly centred in the role. Zeljko Lui, my fellow compatriot from the non-existent Yugoslavia, gifted with a gorgeous voice of remarkable width and an echo of a cathedral bell, was an impressive father Germont thanks mostly to his vocal ability. It would be utterly mind-spinning had his acting be a little more fine-tuned. I cannot quite pinpoint what was imperfect there, maybe a little excess of intent was visible, but this comes under the category of hair-splitting.

There is a custom in some cultures that if a girl dies before she gets married she is buried in a wedding gown. Such funeral apparel is the only dress this Violeta wears. In fact she appears as already dead.  There is only one moment in this Traviata when Violeta appears alive, and that is when she meets the father Germont. This is the only time she is trying to negotiate something for herself in her earthly life, the only occasion when she for a moment she considers her life a reality. That is when she losses the only thing that matters to her. But, did she ever have it in the first place? Was it yet another illusion? Everything else before and after this moment of attempt to be in this world to claim her love, is either recollection of a nightmare life passing before her as if  she is a remote, detached observer from another world, or everything just fades away and becomes reduced to mere flashes of fluorescent light in the darkness.

The entire opera appears as one final prolonged look back at the life already gone in which there was nothing anyways, only some shadows and distant noises. This becomes strikingly obvious in the scene which takes place in the countryside home.  What in the libretto is suggested as a country house where Violeta and Alfredo enjoy their passionate love affair, Mr. Mussbach stages as Violeta's lifeless body lying on the ground, face towards the floor, over which, as if he does not notice her, Alfredo sings his exaltation of redeeming love into a void emptiness . Was her love ever a possibility, regardless of her terminal illness, regardless of her past?

The cold empty black stage remains unchanged throughout. It is divided into front and back planes by a transparent black curtain. It is all one big nothing. The dynamic is created by intermittent film footage superimposed over the images of the story as it unfolds. The film depicts a road as an unambiguous symbol of a life path. Violeta's life is a speedy highway trip through the rainy night. This life by night is from time to time seen through a rainy windshield from the position of a traveler in the hands of an invisible driver in an invisible vehicle. The road sometimes turns into a tunnel. Maybe it is the same tunnel in which another young woman, a real princess, met her death in the arms of her forbidden lover. There are other hints at fallen heroines of life depicted in this story. Some people recognize in Violeta's hairstyle and dress hints at Marilyn Monroe. Life and fiction abound with inspiration for the theme of  the tragic fate of love without the blessing of social approval.

Throughout the performance the stage is lit with a somber light which does not shine but rather merely reveals the dark joyless shadows of equally dark and joyless people passing by Violeta only remotely. The line between illusions reality and hallucinations is blurred. It is all real and unreal at the same time. That is perhaps the greatest effect of this production.

The only time in which we see a crisp and refreshing light akin to sunlight is when long and painful agony ends.

In spite of merciless reduction in colour and dcor, this Traviata delivers this tragic story in flavours stronger and sharper than any other Traviata I have seen.

The DVD should contain a warning for the emotionally infirm not to watch this production without access to the shoulder of a responsible and balanced adult.",1268352000,4,4565,4.808673469387755
8190145,2,B000PAU24O,"This current example of European Regietheater can be summed up in one word:  monotonous.  Verdi's heart-wrenching portrait of a good-time girl sacrificing all for the love of a single man hardly contains a monotonous moment.  But in the hands of an egocentric director (Peter Mussbach) who wants to be noticed as much as the composer, even this most tuneful and inventive of scores is diminished.

Here at Aix en Provence the opera is performed without pause as Violetta takes a night-time road trip through the rain and pain to reach her Final Destination 5.  With the exception of a few bony chairs that make brief appearances and water dripping on clear plastic curtains in front of the stage, all of the scenery is provided by lasers and projections.  The strip of highway that serves as the stage becomes at times a fast trip through a tunnel or a journey over a large city bridge, but most of the time there is just darkness illuminated by lane markings.

And, just as there is so little contrast in the scenery, there is a disturbing stasis in the way the singers portray their characters...Violetta is already half-dead at the start of the piece and spends more time lying in the road than a dead skunk.  Gravity seems to be her special enemy:  she can't seem to stay on her feet for more than 3 minutes at a time. Furthermore, she never leaves the stage nor changes her dress from the start of the overture to the last sad note, when the Health Department finally scrapes her up.  Alfredo is somewhat cold and stiff and seems not to be too engaged in the proceedings.  Germont, the one character who is usually the most wooden, is here the most moving, and physically touches Violetta much more than Alfredo does.  Is stage director Mussbach trying to elicit echoes of the love triangle of Tristan & Isolde here?  If so, bad move.

Without visual variety or progression of personality, how could boredom not set in?  It's no wonder that the director chose to eliminate the intermissions, giving this production a more compact cinematic feel, with the tragic Marilyn Monroe (Violetta) giving an overly-histrionic one-note performance.  Definitely no Oscar in view here.

One thing about this production that does impress, though, is the sense of musical preparedness and unity.  Seldom have the singers in an Italian opera been so keenly in tune with the conductor's wishes without seeming to constantly stare into the pit. Although I disagreed with many of conductor Yutaka Sado's tempos, I marvelled at the way the singers and the orchestra were so precise and tight.  Certain crescendos and instances of rich orchestral detail brought me little stabs of pleasure, even if the miking in the pit produced a somewhat boxy sound. If you want to hear a conductor in total control, this opera recording is a fine example.

In fact, in viewing this performance, I thought it might actually be more enjoyable as an audio CD, since the visuals only detract from these limitedly laudable musical aspects.  Mireille Lelunsch as Marilyn/Violetta has a light and agile voice, but not a particularly beautiful one, and didn't try to reach for the high Eb in the first act.  I prefer a meatier sound for this heroine, such as Ileana Cotrubas or Anna Moffo or even Renata Scotto.  Matthew Polenzani's Alfredo was also on the light side, which gave this youth a needed sense of youth.  Ardor and passion, however, were sorely lacking in his portrayal, undoubtedly at Mussbach's request.  Zeljko Lucic as Germont was the evening's pleasure, a Mephistophelean father that, despite a thin upper vocal range, knew how to cajole and dominate. The other bit players seemed to be from a (really bad) training school, or from the chorus.

In the overall creation of the character of Violetta, I'm still partial to the Zeffirelli film with Teresa Stratas.  Yes, her voice wasn't at its freshest, but SHE understood the journey from carefree philistine to unbelieving love object, to contented member of the country gentry, to wretched sacrificial lamb, to pitiable casualty.  The visual world Zeffirelli creates, plus Domingo at his heartiest and handsomest, comprise a road trip far more fascinating and satisfying than Mussbach's monotonous, misconcieved, moribund mess.",1220832000,14,4257,4.9326788218793824
8190146,5,B000PAU24O,"After reading the only two reviews here on amazon I was confused, and curious.  My copy of this version of La Traviata arrived today, and I
have just viewed it---and wow!  I own 3 other versions of this opera.
I love this version---very metaphysical, thought provoking and beautiful.
No, it's not your gramma's Traviata.  But this one brings out nuances you
may have missed in others.  (BTW---the magazine ""Opera News"" put it on
their best dvd's of 2007 list).  Mireille Delunsch is magnificent,
heartbreaking,  and yes, as stated in a previous review, shows the
fragility of Violetta.  But also, at the end, a strength unseen in
previous Violetta's.  LOVED IT!!!  THis is one I will look forward to
watching again and again, along with my Netrebko/Villazon version and
the lovely Angela Gheorgiou one as well.  If you go for the very traditional, rent it, don't buy.  But if you love all the many facets
to this gorgeous opera, don't hesitate.",1200528000,7,944,4.8375
8190147,1,B000PAU24O,"This is my sixth recording on DVD plus a couple on VHS in addition to one taped off PBS. No contest: this is without doubt the worst display by a self-indulgent stage director allowed to put forth his incredibly bad taste without someone in authority at the theater stoppng him and suggesting that he must be suffering from temporary insanity.

I have been searching for the perfect La Traviata for well over 50 years and yes, I realize that my search may never be successful due to the difficulty of assembling the perfect cast. The Villazon-Netrebko version comes close (and I treasure it, as different as it may be) but Hampson as the elder Germont is a disaster. I admire Thomas Hampson greatly but this role is not for him.

Back to the recording in question. Violetta is a disaster. Her voice too much of the time reminds me of the eastern European sopranos of the 50's and 60's with their thin little voices sounding as if they were recorded in the men's washroom of the Bolshoi theater. The elder Germont hasn't got a bad voice but as with Violetta, he is crushed by this ridiculous production (much of which is in semi-darkness). The Alfredo by Polenzani is nicely sung and would be an asset to any decent production.

In my opinion,(and I have very definite opinions when it comes to my favorite amazingly visceral opera by Verdi), this is the worst production of La Traviata I have had the displeasure to see. Of course, there are always a few moments in any production that are outstanding and there are a few in this one as well. Very few! I wish I were articulate enough to really express my feelings for this mess.

I could not select less than one star in this format but be assured, ZERO STARS for this production.",1185494400,11,1731,4.538461538461538
8190148,5,B000PAU24O,"This is an astonishing DVD. It brings home to me as never before just how fragile Violetta's hold on life is, and how fragile her entire life and her possibility of happiness is. The events of her life have placed her in a situation of emotional and societal vulnerability, and the amazing performances and the utterly remarkable directing here highlight this without ever transgressing Verdi's idea, music and storyline.

I cannot praise the directing and the IDEA of the setting by Peter Wussbach highly enough. I usually prefer traditional settings, but this was like a ""wow"" that punched through all my expectations. The conception is relatively abstract yet simple - Violetta is present throughout as either a real figure whose proximity to death makes her appear almost ""not there"", or the whole thing is her memory of the great romantic love, or it is an almost ghost-like impression, after her death, of what occurred - take your pick. It doesn't matter - what matters is that here we have a woman who, above all, is dying. Everything else is secondary to that - she is fragile, almost transparent, at times fading, overwhelmingly vulnerable, and the fact that this is a great and tragic love story is most beautifully INCLUDED in the fact that this is also a commentary upon the delicacy and fragility of her life. She is so close to death - one can see it from the start.

The use of a night-lit highway... the portrayal of all the figures that come and go as being separate from Violetta... the incredible frisson of love and despair that is conveyed between the main characters (Violetta, her one (and last) beloved, his father)... I've never seen anything to equal it. The casting is outstanding. There isn't a weak link.

Mireille Delunsch is outstanding as the doomed Violetta, attired in a white ""Hollywood"" gown and with a distinct look of Marilyn Monroe in this portrayal. It's not a fluffy performance - it's just incredibly vulnerable. Her acting is magnificent and her voice is so beautiful and emotionally involved that I was utterly absorbed and overwhelmingly moved. It's the finest Violetta I have seen. In essence, the acting is so dramatically fragile that I could well imagine Callas having conveyed something similar.

Matthew Polenzani is a fantastic Alfredo. He looks beautiful, ardent, sufficiently youthful to make the story credible - I was very taken with him. And the voice...! Why haven't we heard more of this wonderful tenor? He's got everything one could wish for - the role is sung passionately, tenderly, with the tormented moments of sudden violence when his jealousy and pain overwhelm him, with the unrestrained and all-embracing fervour of young love.

Germont, sung by Zeljko Lucic, couldn't be bettered. His singing is sensitive, powerful, beautiful... his acting is strong and conveys the troubles of a father who wants the best for his son and does not think that Alfredo's involvement with a courtesan is in any way good for him. This very human face of Germont gains even more depth as the duet between Violetta and Alfredo shows his realisation that this ""fallen woman"" does feel a very real love for his son... and has given up so much for him. That he asks her to give up even more becomes entirely credible - and that is one reason why this entire opera is so heart-breaking.

Violetta's love is doomed from the start. But the deeper tragedy is that her very life was doomed too. From the first moment of her love being born, her life's flower was already fading... She was already dying.

The conducting by Sado and the playing of the Orchestre de Paris are superb. I feel that the entire experience and the entire performance of this opera has never been bettered (although probably equalled).

Recommended so strongly that I hope everyone who reads this will purchase this outstanding DVD.",1180224000,14,3848,4.86412213740458
