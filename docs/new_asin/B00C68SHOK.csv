5691074,5,B00C68SHOK,Great movies. Wish WB made these movies with better manufacturing other than DVD-R but I'll take this anytime. I hope they continue to do more of the Pre-Code films.,1393200000,5,165,4.724137931034483
5691075,5,B00C68SHOK,These movies are classy.  They don't show you all the explicitness in movies today.  These are the thinking persons films.  Everything is brought on through suggestion.,1391644800,5,168,5.384615384615385
5691076,5,B00C68SHOK,"I love just about every film that WA has put into the Forbidden Hollywood series, and can't wait for more releases - I'm surprised they didn't put out a set just for Kay Francis instead of individual releases, considering the number of pre-codes she was in.",1390867200,7,257,4.608695652173913
5691077,5,B00C68SHOK,I've wanted to see Downstairs for decades and it didn't disappoint.  Excellent film with a great performance from Gilbert.  Mandalay with Kay Francis was also good.,1383091200,8,164,5.269230769230769
5691078,4,B00C68SHOK,"The latest in the Forbidden Hollywood series has a Kay Francis (always a treat to watch) film that is worth purchasing the whole set, although a Pre-code Richard Barthelmess film is another good reason.

1934 Mandalay with Kay Francis, Ricardo Cortez, & Lyle Talbot is the main feature.  The scene where boards the boat at the last minute with no luggage, gets a cabin, & next we see her she is unpacking a trunk is incredible.  Mandalay is 5 star stuff - not to be missed

The other films are:  Massacre (1934) a good solid movie with Barthelmess & Ann Dvorak (another great actress); The Wet Parade (1932) an OK (& long!) movie with Walter Huston, Myrna Loy, & Neil Hamilton; & Downstairs (1932) a pretty good but downbeat film with John Gilbert.  Overall, a pretty good assortment.

Some of the films include the original trailers, but there are no other extras.  Warner Archives has a lot of pre-codes available, most of them minor films.  The Forbidden Hollywood collections are the best.  Note:  this review is based on the films, not the quality of the discs or the format!",1365552000,54,1080,4.661375661375661

8577549,5,B00C68SHOK,"I like the Forbidden Hollywood series very much and this DVD set is no exception. All 5 films are high quality very few scratches and pops if any. Compared to the other available pre-code sets out there, the Forbidden Hollywood series is top-of-the-line. They are a little more pricey than the other collections out there but it's really worth it for the restoration value. I highly recommend this set and the series in general.",1527120000,,428,4.797297297297297
8577550,5,B00C68SHOK,"All four of these movies were enjoyable. Downstairs, with John Gilbert,  may in many ways be the best of the group, however the one that hit the spot for me was Mandalay. Kay Francis was beautiful. She played the piano and sang which was icing on the cake. Ricardo Cortez lead our heroine down a rocky road of romance only to be rescued by a a doctor with a drinking problem, Lyle Talbot. This was the young and slender LT and not the middle aged expanded waistline version on TV of the nineteen fifties and sixties: Ozzie and Harriet, the Bob Cummings Show and others. The most villainous character was portrayed by none other than Charlie Chan himself. That is, Warner Oland, who played Chan in numerous films of the nineteen thirties. Sadly, four were lost in a film vault fire in 1937. All in all,  these movies  are worth their time and price.",1515024000,,848,4.4935064935064934
8577551,2,B00C68SHOK,"They're a good bunch of movies, but it's too bad the disc is a DVD-R and not a pressed DVD.  It means it costs more and may have quality issues.",1486684800,2,144,3.8
8577552,5,B00C68SHOK,"Excellent restored old films that well represents Hollywood film making at that time. Not masterpieces, but films worth saving! Wonderful old films that shouldn't be ""forbidden"" to be seen!",1483920000,3,189,5.551724137931035
8577553,5,B00C68SHOK,I've allready watched the wet parade and will watch the rest.  Great movie set (4 CD's) of the oldies.,1434844800,,102,4.368421052631579
8577554,4,B00C68SHOK,"I bought this only for MANDALAY - the other movies were completely unknown and had no interest for me.

But now I've watched MANDALAY - loved it - and looking at the other titles.  DOWNSTAIRS stars John Gilbert, and the premise was his idea.  Now that I have this, I will finally see Richard Barthelmess, admittedly not at his height, but still.

This is an expensive box set.  I bought it for MANDALAY alone and I don't regret it.  And just may even enjoy the others.",1433721600,4,468,4.383720930232558
8577555,2,B00C68SHOK,This offering was just Ho-hum. The first volume of Pre-code Hollywood included Baby Face and The Red Headed Woman which really fit the bill as racy for early 30s.,1422403200,,162,4.620689655172414
8577556,4,B00C68SHOK,"I thought this Forbidden collection a bit less entertaining than some of the others, but still worthwhile from an historical point of view.  The Wet Parade provides interesting insights into the prohibition years.  Massacre is an interesting look at the treatment of native Americans that is ahead of its time.  Because these were done in the 30's there is an interesting historical perspective.  The other films: Mandalay and Downstairs are interesting because of the stars:  Kay Francis and John Gilbert.  Mandalay also has an interesting perspective on white slavery, a ""forbidden"" topic.  The Gilbert film is interesting because it is one of those Gilbert ""talkies"" that preceded his ultimate demise in ""talkies"".  In this one his voice is okay and he is quite good as a chauffeur with no scruples.",1411948800,11,802,5.115384615384615
