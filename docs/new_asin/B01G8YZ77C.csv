7758966,5,B01G8YZ77C,"Other than the Seventh season of the Liberaci Talent Scouts, this was the best TV I have ever seen. Well, maybe, and the Elvis episode of The Eward Sullivani Show.
So it was GREAT, wonderful acting by the whole NCIS Team, and the Dancing scene near the End, Phantastico. No violence, great music, food that looked incredible, as well as edible. The thing that draws me back, over and over, however was the unique masturbation scene just before she killed The Monster, about half-way through.
Truly wonderful, worth every penny.  Maybe more...",1505433600,,542,4.891304347826087
