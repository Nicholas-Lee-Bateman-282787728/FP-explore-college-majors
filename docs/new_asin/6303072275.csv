7836974,5,6303072275,"Out of the 6 Universal Home Video ""Jack Benny Program"" VHS videos (circa 1994), I think I like this volume (#2) the best; although all of the selections are top-notch in my estimation.
We're treated to 2 Classic Jack Benny Programs per tape, here featuring guest stars Peter Lorre and, in the second show on the cassette, The Smothers Brothers.
The first program, with Lorre, is simply hysterically funny! We have Peter portraying--what else?--a gun-toting gangster who's in desperate need of plastic surgery to alter his appearance after having been on the lam following a 6-victim murder spree (7 after he plugs Benny himself during this episode of hilarity).
It's actually a mix-up by the plastic surgeon (played by veteran Benny cast member Mel Blanc) that results in a reasonable facsimile of Jack Benny's face being given to Peter. Hijinks then ensue. A great episode which also features singer Joanie Sommers.
The Smothers Brothers join Jack in the second offering on the video. They perform some musical numbers and then team with Jack in an amusing sketch, which features several humorous bits of dialogue. Another worthy oldie from the Benny files. But, then again, they all are (IMO).
So temporarily put down your out-of-tune violins and order this video before it's too late!",1059264000,4,1287,5.046948356807512
