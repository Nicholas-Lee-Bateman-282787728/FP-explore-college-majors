8049661,3,B0007OP1NK,"Alpha Video's ""Ramar of the Jungle"" DVD series continues with four more early episodes from the show's first season that were originally broadcast in 1952.  All of the adventures on this DVD include Charlie, the Cockney guide who leads Dr. Reynolds and Professor Ogden through the sometimes treacherous jungles of Africa.  Video quality on this release is about average for the series; that is to say that fans who have been searching for episodes on the DVD format will probably appreciate these episodes, but casual fans unaccustomed to lesser visual quality will likely be put off.  Volumes 1 and 2 of Alpha Video's ""Ramar"" series continue to offer the best in visual quality and are recommended to those who only want a sampling of the best looking episodes available.  All other volumes, to date, are primarily for collectors of this enjoyable jungle adventure series.",1113177600,4,873,5.041666666666667
