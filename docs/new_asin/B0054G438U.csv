4567961,4,B0054G438U,I started with Stacy McCarthy's Busy Mom Yoga. I fell in love with it and ordered several more of her videos. This one has certainly helped to increase my hip flexibility and decrease my low back pain. I appreciate that she includes different levels for each move. This makes me consistently challenge myself. I also benefit from her frequent reminders on form and breath. She helps mellow my mood without being a weirdo like some of the other videos.,1400976000,9,451,4.7215189873417724

4567963,5,B0054G438U,"This is an excellent DVD to help open up the hips.  Stacy is an excellent instructor and she is easy to follow.  The poses really do help to open up the hips, and Stacy uses options to ensure that the back does not get strained.

4567964,5,B0054G438U,"Great DVD! I really like this practice.  As a former pro athlete, I appreciate a yoga teacher who knows what it means dealing with muscle tightness. As much as I find' hip openers challenging, incorporating them into an overall soothing yoga flow practice, they do wonders for my body... releasing the tension throughout. I like that I can do this practice any time I want from the comfort of my home. Thanks Stacy!",1307923200,5,415,4.684931506849315
4567965,5,B0054G438U,"I use this DVD to help me with my tight hips and hamstrings. When I don't have time to run to the gym or bored with my normal routine, I can pop Stacy's DVD and work on opening up this area. It's challenging but each time I practice, I get a little more flexible, and a little more open. Even it's only a micro inch, I feel better. Stacy has a nice way of breaking it down moving your through each posture and also gives your alternative poses if you're not quite there.",1307923200,11,470,4.064516129032258
8456633,3,B0054G438U,There isn't much to this practice. Its very passive and I was expecting more flow based on the description. It does focus on the hips and a bit on the shoulders.,1524700800,,161,4.225806451612903

8456637,1,B0054G438U,Way more advanced than billed. I was humiliated as usual with how rookie I am. Not for beginners.,1478995200,2,97,4.444444444444445
8456638,3,B0054G438U,I can't say I felt this stretched my hip flexor muscles like I'd hoped it would. It's an okay video though.,1469404800,,107,4.142857142857143
8456639,3,B0054G438U,Longer and more difficult than I thought it would be. Not a pregnancy friendly practice but will be great for after birth. Still looking for a yoga DVD that can help me with my pregnancy related hip pain and is a good workout.,1461715200,,226,4.27906976744186
