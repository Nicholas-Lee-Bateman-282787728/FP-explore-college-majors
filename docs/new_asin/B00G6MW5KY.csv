6061665,5,B00G6MW5KY,"This show is fantastic.  Well layered and clever.  I've been waiting for any sign that it would see a U.S. release.  Hopefully the sales do well here, and we are able to see the other seasons.  I hope to own them all, as none of the seasons have let me down thus far.  If you're not sure about it, check it out on Netflix.  If you enjoy shows such as Orange is the New Black, check this one out.  Much more of a serious tone.",1477094400,5,425,3.929411764705882
6061666,5,B00G6MW5KY,Got season 1 and I hope the remaining seasons will be out soon. This is really a gritty look at what life is like in a real women's prison. The story line is great and the acting is spot on.  If you aren't careful you will catch yourself binge watching the whole first season.,1474070400,4,276,4.111111111111111

6061668,5,B00G6MW5KY,"If you were a fan of the original Cell Block H show, you will LOVE this! As a big fan of Orange is the New Black, I believe this is a much more gripping and suspenseful show, wish it was on Netflix in the US!",1410048000,3,208,3.6444444444444444
6061669,3,B00G6MW5KY,"I was surprised at how much I liked this series, though part of it was that I had fun listening to the accents.  Remember that this set requires a region-free dvd/blu-ray player before ordering.  There were some genuinely good (and in some cases creepy) performances and you're constantly guessing at who the ""good guys"" are.  Watching Bea get pushed to her breaking point is an interesting process.  Overall, not quite as good as ""Orange is the New Black"" (U.S.A.) or ""Bad Girls"" (U.K.), but on the verge of getting there.",1396051200,5,523,4.777777777777778
6061670,5,B00G6MW5KY,Great drama about the close relationships women can have living in close quarters. Bea and Franky characters show good contrast in their natural tendency towards leadership roles.,1493164800,,179,5.666666666666667
6061671,5,B00G6MW5KY,"I thought Orange is the new Black was good, this show is AWESOME and definitinly more realistic. The acting is excellent. The script is perfect. Its a cat and mouse one for sure. Excellently written and directed. In my opinion and my hubands, it makes the other one look like you need to turn the channel to this  one folks. I love it!!!!! The other show is stupid now after season 2. This one we watched straight through all the seasons everynight till it finished, we couldn't stop watching it. There is no lull at all. Put on pause to get a drink or a sandwich, cause YOU WILL MISS SOMETHING. As soon as the prices drop, I will purchase every season. Not all that sex crap in it either. This is a story!!",1491609600,,707,4.276119402985074
6061672,5,B00G6MW5KY,Wentworth is one of the best shows that I've watched in a long time! I'm my opinion it's way better then Orange,1490572800,5,111,4.090909090909091
6061673,5,B00G6MW5KY,I love this show!  It is an Australian show about a woman's prison.  It is well acted and had me hooked from the very first episode.  I found this on Netflix and binged all 4 season.  The 5th is coming and I can't wait.  It is all drama and not for children.,1487376000,4,258,3.8846153846153846

Friend  I am hooked and just ordered
Season 2",1485561600,3,82,3.823529411764706
6061676,1,B00G6MW5KY,"TV Guide says it's better than ""Orange is the New Black"". Do they get paid for endorsements?
Why one star? Would have been less if possible.
1. Clearly an O is the NB ripoff if there ever was a model for such a non-creative, morally bankrupt endeavour.
2. The overall prison structure as well as internal structure of affiliations is the same.
3. The overall theme is the same in terms of our central characters from inmates to staff; their reasons for being there; their personal issues; their alliances. Even their appearances and personalities mirror O is the NB.
4. The subplots from drugs & how they play out to personal conflicts and friendships - ditto.
5. Not well thought out with murder to drug exchanges to sex not being monitored. Seems to be an oversight that security cameras are nearly nonexistent especially in vulnerable areas.
6. My most damning criticism is reserved for the milquetoast bland characters and/or actors. NOT believable.",1482710400,,953,4.888888888888889
6061677,5,B00G6MW5KY,"Once you spend some time with Wentworth, you will find it very difficult to go back to Orange is the New Black. This is a crackling story, well-told and -acted, with just enough soap to make it all flow.",1479772800,2,203,4.230769230769231
6061678,5,B00G6MW5KY,Fantastic Show. Hope to see the rest of the seasons released as Region 1 for viewing in the USA.,1479340800,6,96,4.105263157894737
6061679,5,B00G6MW5KY,"How many times will you, like me, divert your eyes from the community happenings inside the womens Wentworth Correction Centre? Expect adult viewing. Character driven and compellingeven when it turns brutal. Whos side will you takefor how long? It is reality? Wentworth just might scare you straight. There is NO OTHER crime series like Wentworth. Strong women you shouldnt turn your back on.
This is season 1 of an ongoing series recently commissioned for season 5. Expect another region one DVD season soon.

8621085,5,B00G6MW5KY,I bought this for a birthday present and we watched the first episode today.  It's really well done and we love the show so much I am going to order the next season today.  Please keep the series going as long as you can; it has wonderful characters and lots of unexpected twists and turns and keeps a person wanting to see what happens next.

8621088,5,B00G6MW5KY,Great dramatic prison show!,1501286400,,27,6.0
8621089,5,B00G6MW5KY,"Wentworth is a reboot of the long running (692 episodes in 8 seasons) late 70's to mid 80's Australian prison drama Prisoner (Prisoner: Cell Block H in the USA, to avoid confusion with the brilliant science fiction series The Prisoner by Patrick McGoohan). The original was hugely successful and is legendary for producing brilliant characters that became iconic in their day. The original series, which can be seen on Youtube, was, by today's standards, a bit over the top acting-wise, narrative-wise and otherwise, and is something of a guilty pleasure, again, by today's standards. But times change, and while the setting has remained the same (Wentworth is an Australian Correctional Facility for Women) the characters have been updated, and dialed down and more realistic. Some have, to my surprise, been rewritten to be contrary to their original counterparts (the original Vera Bennett was a bitter awkward woman who loathed the prisoners and made no bones about hiding her sentiments (hence her  rude sobriquet) while the new Vera is socially awkward but sweet natured. The drastic  make over was given to Frankie Doyle, who was darker, volatile and far less intelligent in the original series. The new Frankie is almost a polar opposite of her original incarnation, and it works brilliantly on this version). The high drama is still there, the rawness in behavior and shifting loyalties, the yearning for a return to life ""on the outside"" but the performances by the great actresses are restrained and inspiring. I won't single out any one actor because ALL OF THEM are brilliant. They've embraced their roles and play their characters with such relish, you'll soon forget you're rooting for the prisoners to succeed. Such is the warped world of Wentworth. The outside rules don't apply. Once you are locked away survival is the name of the game.

Everyone compares this show to OITNB. I tried to watch OITNB and couldn't make it past the first episode. Granted, I'm biased as I was a fan of the original series, but I didn't find OITNB anywhere near as engrossing as Wentworth.  The distinction between the two show is OITNB is a dark comedy, whereas Wentworth is a crime drama. I prefer Wentworth, but can see the appeal of OITNB. I think there is room for both.",1500681600,,2273,4.942408376963351

8621091,5,B00G6MW5KY,"Spectacular, outstanding series. The writing in this series is so well done- so complex- I find myself not being able to watch without pacing in front of the TV, yelling at the TV- ""AHH...NOO...she's going to.....""
I would say it is not an exaggeration that this is one of the best written, best acted series on TV. Period.  Love it.",1498694400,,333,4.55
8621092,5,B00G6MW5KY,this is the show that got me started on Wentworth with its violent and embarrasing the women inmates and the men prison guards. Each character especially Bea has something to prove from each episode on.,1497916800,,202,4.8
