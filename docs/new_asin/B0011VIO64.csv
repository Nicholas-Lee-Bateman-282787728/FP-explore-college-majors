3070352,4,B0011VIO64,"Although this is by no means the best documentary I've ever seen it is nonetheless a very satisfying viewing experience.  I am a great fan of Jimmy Carter, one of the two greatest living men on earth (the other being Nelson Mandela).  This film basically follows him throughout the country on a book tour of his controversial tome on the policies of Israel toward Palestineans.  What I like about this work is its intimate portrait of a man who inspires great respect in some and rabid hatred in others.  That fact is dramatically driven home when Carter is confronted by a very hostile man who obviously has much disdain for the him.  But there are also many people who show great reverence for the former President as he candidly discusses politically explosive matters related to the Middle East.  I strongly recommend this film to anyone wanting to know more about Jimmy Carter, a complex and profoundly humane man.",1201651200,13,919,4.784810126582278

3070356,4,B0011VIO64,"In this apparently simple yet wonderfully directed documentary,  one of the best and bravest american directors meets one of America's last notable personalities.
Jonathan Demme, over the years, has progressively abandoned mainstream and fictional films, committing himself to documentaries about music and social/political issues.
Here he deals with maybe the american president who has been most reconsidered after his administration. A simple man with clear and brave ideas, who's never been afraid of telling the truth, even when if didn't make public opinion happy.
Here, those two men, walk together through Carter's struggle against america's prejudice about Palestine and middle east. They even call him an anti-semite, when he simply tries to rebalance the discussion around this subject, calling for human rights and peace.
And so, by showing this trip through the states, you get to know him better, and discover the other side of the brilliant director who came with him",1402704000,3,982,5.4605263157894735

3070358,3,B0011VIO64,"If all of our former presidents were like Jimmy Carter, the world would be a better place. This video takes place after the release of his book about Palestine and apartheid. Although I think apartheid and the equation of Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza probably was extreme, Carter made his point. The Israeli colonization of these lands is bad for the peace process.

This video is even handed, and some opponents of Carter got the ability to voice their displeasure. Although I think Jimmy Carter was not a successful president, his post presidential career has made its impact for the betterment of American society. This video displayed the former presidents viewpoints fairly.",1364169600,,694,5.034782608695652
3070359,5,B0011VIO64,"As an American, the last man I was not embarrassed to say was my president was Jimmy Carter.  However you rate his presidency, did you ever question his integrity?

For that matter, as I thought while viewing the 2007 documentary JIMMY CARTER: MAN FROM PLAINS, compare Jimmy Carter's post-White House years to that of the presidents who followed.  Which do the dirty work with Habitat for Humanity and which take anywhere from $100,000 to $750,000 to give a speech?  Hint: One to whom the former applies is the same ex-president who dares point to the elephant in the room by writing the book PALESTINE: PEACE NOT APARTHEID.

Carter's world tour promoting that 2006 book comprises the lion's share of JIMMY CARTER: MAN FROM PLAINS.  Leave it to director Jonathan Demme, a man who appreciates the spunky be it Melvin Dummar, Clarice Starling, or, in this case, America's 39th president, to portray the essence of forging on because, well, somebody has to do what's right.  Those who think they know everything about the Middle East will learn otherwise, as will those who think they know everything about Jimmy Carter.  Regarding both, you'll find JIMMY CARTER: MAN FROM PLAINS humbling.

3070360,3,B0011VIO64,"""Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains"" is not a biography of the 39th President of the United States; nor is it a chronicle of his time as President, or even of his work with Habitat for Humanities, though both are touched upon in the course of the film.  Rather it is a documentary account of a national book tour Carter conducted in late 2006 to promote his controversial and provocatively entitled tome, ""Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.""  Carter basically gives two reasons why he felt compelled to write the book:  1) the fact that there had been no peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians in the then- five or six years of the Bush administration, and 2) what he sees as the unfair treatment of the Palestinians who live in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Anyone daring (or foolish) enough to venture into this minefield of a topic risks detonating intense passions on both sides of the conflict, but Carter's history and reputation as a peacemaker between the two aggrieved parties would appear to give him some cover on the issue.  Well, not exactly, for we see many, mostly pro-Israeli groups and individuals, protesting and challenging him as he travels around the country providing interviews on this hyper-sensitive subject.

As a movie, ""Jimmy Carter: Man From Plains"" is no more than serviceable, even though it comes with an impressive pedigree, namely Jonathan Demme for a director.  It is obviously sympathetic to Carter's position and it nicely illustrates the basic decency and humanity of a man who has hit the pinnacle of power yet still manages to remain true to the small town values of humility and service on which he was raised.  But it's also unimaginative and redundant, and probably isn't going to do much to assuage the concerns of those who hold opposing views to his.

It's worth seeing for its historical significance though.",1342828800,,1867,4.864353312302839
3070361,5,B0011VIO64,"Jonathan Demme is a master filmmaker so this is a complex portrait of of President Jimmy Carter on a book tour, in one sense a small snapshot of the man.  At first I thought it a standard broadcast documentary missing only the voice of God narrator, but on reviewing it I saw each scene was a different aspect of Jimmy Carter. Using old footage Demme points to the Herculean effort Jimmy Carter invested in the Egyptian-Isreali peace agreement. His work building houses shows Jimmy Carter as a man trying to help people who need it. Either from the perspective of those interested in learning more about Jimmy Carter, or from those seeking a masterclass in documentary making I recommend this film.  Although I am a different person with different views than Jimmy Carter this film  helped me see president Carter as a  caring man, a finer man than history sees him--Demme even explains that in terms of an unfortunate hostage outcome.  Jimmy Carter is outside the ex presidents club in a way.  Maybe that's because, as this film shows him, he is a spiritual and caring man seeking to be just and loving.  It is well crafted about someone I like a whole lot more after seeing A Man of Plains.",1338163200,3,1192,4.62085308056872
3070362,1,B0011VIO64,"Unfortunately, the video is inaccurate, and also boring.  Based on what was ""unsaid"" in this film, it seems like Carter was not only a poor President, but also did much harm during his post-presidency re the Israelis and Palestinians, because of his inherent double standard against the Jews. If he had been even handed post-presidency, he might have had a second opportunity to help make peace--now that would have been a great achievement, and would have made his place in history.",1318204800,5,483,4.962962962962963

First you'll want to know that it isn't a true biography - 70% of the film is devoted to what its like to go on book tour and face folks who love and hate you with equal passion.  Others have reviewed those aspects of the film, so I'll skip ahead to one scene that's not being talked about.  In Chapter 6 of the DVD, there's a brillant mixture of modern debate and old footage of the Camp David meetings. Its not a terribly long scene at all, no more than 10 or 15 minutes, but it is stunningly brillant and shows the deep divisions in the Middle East.  Well worth it for that moment alone.  Other stand out clips: Carter's mother on The Tonight Show, Carter's work after Hurricane Katrina and the honest and viceral rubbutals shown by those who completely disagree with Carter.

3070365,3,B0011VIO64,"Jimmy Carter is an impressive man.  He has set the standard for a productive post-presidency, and the time is ripe for a reassessment of the difficult but often wise decisions he made in office.

Unfortunately, this Jonathan Demme film focuses almost entirely on Carter's 2006 tour promoting his book ""Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid"" and the uproar it spurred.  Carter comes across as courageous, principled and (usually) very patient in the face of the same questions asked over and over again by modestly informed interviewers.  The controversy offers plenty of insight into Carter's character and beliefs, but it's only one aspect of his career.

Demme fills a lot of space with scenes of Carter getting on and off planes, riding in cars, carrying his suitcase, getting makeup applied for interviews, etc.  Comparatively little use is made of archival footage, except for a brief but engaging segment on the Camp David negotiations.  I would have liked less of the former and more of the latter.  As much as I thought I would enjoy this film, I found myself getting bored after the first hour as it kept going over the same ground, instead of giving us a full portrait of the ""Man From Plains"".",1269475200,9,1197,4.891089108910891

It is an excellent documentary and shows the man behind the scenes as he promotes his book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.

I challenge anyone to find any recent politician with half the respect, courtesy, humanity and intelligence that Carter has.

Apparently, the man has no sense of shame--even after contributing (as President) to runaway hyperinflation, endless unemployment, gasoline lines, Iranian hostages, ""malaise"", and a ""giant rabbit"" which unfortunately missed its target. And now the Dorkus is once again singing the praises of Hamas. OK--the man can build houses . But he weakened this country tremendously. He was a disgrace as a leader and was soundly defeated in a landslide election after only 1 term.

More recently, he said on PBS that no senator or congressman, ""Could ever vote against an issue favored by the Israeli lobby."" And he said this with a mean, goofy, sarcastic smirk. You'll learn nothing from this film which is to be avoided!!",1245110400,7,971,5.217948717948718

3070372,3,B0011VIO64,"No matter what if you are/were president you got blood on your hands....
Maybe it was justified, but maybe not.
Probably not from a Christian perspective I would think.
Worst president ever?
Only a wingnut, rightwinger jag- off could spew that slogan out.
Regardless of to what extent Jimmy Carter was indeed a failure as a president, he has undeniably done a lotta good since returning to life as a ""private"" citizen. He's a busy bee alright and lookin' at him in this film you have to hope you'll be going that strong in your 80s. He's a likable guy. And boy is he religious. Jimmy Carter ""worst president"" to wingnuts is a devout Christian. Not for pretend. Reads the Bible every single night with his wife of well over 50 years of marriage. And when he is on the road, which is a lot, they each read the same parts before going to bed. Anyway, really a most  unfortuante and unintended profound result of Carter's presidential campaign way back in '76 was the birth of the political religious Right. His speaking openly of his ""born again"" trip woke up a slouching beast and the result has been a total disaster for America. Oh well. Really no making up for that. He wrote a book dealing with that issue. The roots of the political machine that helped create Dubya has it's beginnings with the good Christian peanut farmer from the plains.

What's most interesting about this doc on Carter is that Demme and crew (""Silence of the Lams"") follow Carter around after he commits treason and morphs into wicked ""liar"" and obviously an anti-Semitic, Israel hating terrorist lover. For real. See it for yourself. After his book _Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid_ Jimmy Carter came under intense fire. Carter spoke out on what is clearly the situation with Israel and it's treatment of the Palestinian people -but whether or not you believe that- ""Man of the Plains"" shows what happens, even to a former president of the United States, when you criticize Israel.",1225324800,2,1956,4.716374269005848

The book's deliberately provocative title was designed to spark discussion, and the thrust of the 2007 film is to show the media-intensified firestorm Carter faced as a result.

To his immense credit, Demme lets Carter speak for himself in the film and doesn't allow a narrator to provide color commentary on the former president's hectic touring schedule. What comes across is a man rightfully proud of the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, and has most recently taken to heart his sense of responsibility as a private citizen and former leader to share the devastation he has seen the Palestinians experience in the occupied areas cut off from the rest of the world. It's an arc that Demme explores through an effective use of archival footage, interviews with key figures (including Carter's wife of 62 years, Rosalynn, who speaks movingly about what led Menachem Begin to sign the final treaty), and the robust, even-keeled presence Carter maintains throughout despite what seems to be a dizzying pace and the consistent critical onslaught. Much of Carter's politic demeanor can be attributed to his faith, including nightly Bible readings with Rosalynn (no matter where he is), but Demme also shows the discipline Carter employs with his handlers and in his regular regimen of swimming laps.

It's definitely a favorable impression of the former president, which is unlikely to sit well with detractors who view him as a treasonous rabble-rouser, but the effect is understandable given that some of Carter's more vocal opponents refused to be filmed, including Dr. Kenneth Stein, who resigned as a Carter Center fellow (of whom Carter dismissed as an absentee member), and a roomful of protesting rabbi elders in Phoenix. Fortunately, renowned Harvard professor and attorney Alan Dershowitz is included as one of the most vocal opponents of Carter's book. His fair-minded comments provide a critical counterbalance to the positive image of Carter, and interestingly, it is never really explained why Carter would not face Dershowitz in a public debate at Brandeis University, who initially turned down Carter's proposal to lecture for free. Intriguingly, Demme takes a behind-the-scenes approach to the various media interviews, whether it's Terry Gross, Charlie Rose, Wolf Blitzer, or Tavis Smiley. In turn, Carter expertly modulates his points to fit the format, including an amusingly deadpan confession to Jay Leno on who really wears the pants in the Carter marriage.

Demme also incorporates the other key priorities in Carter's life to provide more dimension to the portrait - his dedicated work on Habitat for Humanity and as caretaker of the land his family has owned for nearly two centuries around Plains. The parts of the film that drag unnecessarily are more logistical in nature - traveling repeatedly with his kowtowing Simon & Schuster publicist and preparing the customers for the book signings. At 125 minutes, the film runs a mite long and could have benefited from another editing session. Extras are plentiful on the 2008 DVD starting with over thirty minutes of additional scenes and a half-hour featurette on the making of the soundtrack. Neither feels essential though an extended sequence showing a signing at Costco brought out a perturbed woman who tersely told Carter he should be tried for treason. Demme and producer Neda Armian also contribute a very thoughtful commentary track. Trailers for ten other Sony Classics films on DVD complete the extras.",1208476800,2,5101,6.222379603399434
3070376,3,B0011VIO64,"My respect for Jimmy Carter drew me to this.

The film surrounds the release of Carter's book and book tour on Palestine and the obstacles he met because of it.  We get a sense of Jimmy's character and devotion to what he takes on and also his emotional tie to people, religion and our place in the scheme of things on earth.

As a film, I was less impressed, especially with the shaky camera work in some places.  I think there is a better documentary about Jimmy Carter to be made.",1207872000,3,483,4.274725274725275
3070377,5,B0011VIO64,"People who admire Jimmy Carter -- and I am among them -- will enjoy this documentary, which provides a fascinating look at a man who is devoting his life to making a better world. The film makers follow President Carter as he tours to promote his book, ""Palestine Peace Not Apartheid,"" which shined a light on Israel's violations of Palestinians' basic human rights, and inflamed animosity among Israel's supporters in the United States.

Having witnessed, on a visit to the Occupied Territories, the Israeli military bulldozing Palestinian homes because Israel's leaders want the Palestinian land but not their kind in the Jewish state, I can vouch for the accuracy of Carter's criticisms of Israel.  Critics of President Carter's book, as shown in the film, apparently cannot refute his facts; therefore, they must resort to ad hominem attacks.

It is enlightening about the human condition to observe prominent critics badgering Carter about a book they have not read; and a woman accusing the former President of the United States of treason, presumably because he exhibited insufficient loyalty to her favorite foreign country (this clip is in the special features).

""Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains"" affords a rare opportunity to watch a prominent octogenarian statesman speak the truth about an unpopular cause, sometimes to antagonistic audiences, calmly parrying vituperative attacks with reason and facts. One short segment in the film, as Carter draws on a notepad the Occupied Territories and notes the location of the wall and the Israeli ""settlements"" throughout Palestinian land, is more informative about the source of the conflict than a year's worth of coverage on CNN. I highly recommend the film, which is artfully directed, and the special features, which are as interesting as the clips included in the film.",1207785600,3,1829,5.2534246575342465

3070380,5,B0011VIO64,"This is a great film and like the book that ignited the debate, almost all of the people on here condemning it have clearly not seen it.  Jimmy Carter is the only president who has made real preogress in bringing peace to Israel and Palestine and yet all of a sudden he is labeled as this racist because he dares to call a spade a spade.  If you read the book you will quickly see that although not a Zionist, Carter is FAR from being anti-semetic. There isn't a US leader out there with more friends in Israel or who has spent as much time and energy there.  And it is truly horrific to see these insults being unfairly hurled at such a man of peace.

It is fascinating to watch the events unfold throughout his tour to promote his book- Palestine, Peace Not Apartheid.  Let's face it- if he hadn't dared to use that word in the title noone would have read it.  To say that there are no commonalities between Israeli policy toward the Palestinians and Apartheid in South Africa is ridiculous.",1206921600,11,993,4.369565217391305
3070381,5,B0011VIO64,"Anyone who had access to television news in 2006 will remember the storm of controversy following the publication of former President Jimmy Carter's book, ""Palestine: Peace, Not Apartheid.""  This film recalls those days in great detail and reminds us that many  of the book's critics had not even bothered to read it before denouncing it.

I predict that many of the same critics of that book and Carter's even-handed position on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict will return to denounce Jonathan Demme's film without ever bothering to see it.  They will continue to assert that Israel is completely innocent of creating anything that could be considered an apartheid situation.  Their hope is that people will ignore Carter's simple request that everyone take the time to look at the facts on the ground before automatically taking the Israeli side in this long-standing dispute.  Anyone who does so can at least then agree that the walls constructed by Israel encroach in many places onto long-held Palestinian lands.

Carter points out in several instances in the film that Israel certainly has the right to defend itself and its borders against terrorist attacks; his objection is to the locations where the walls have been built and the manner in which they have been used to house the Palestinians as virtual prisoners.  It is much easier for the critics to simply assume that Carter is anti-Israeli.  I submit that any honest viewer of the film cannot maintain such an opinion of him.

Even those who might disagree with Carter's positions would have to be amazed at the sheer level of energy shown in the film on the part of this eighty-three year old man who seems willing to speak anytime, anywhere in defense of his views.  In viewing the film, I was encouraged to see the respectful response that he received when speaking before what might have been expected to be a hostile audience at Brandeis.  On the other hand, my hopes were tempered by the young street protestor in the film who took great delight in shouting to Palestinians and their supporters that, ""Nobody cares about you.""",1206576000,17,2097,4.943019943019943

A time when everyone in the operation was ashamed and saddened for having let Carter down when he gave them full operational and strategic control. Carter refused to let any of his generals or special ops take the fall and insisted on 100% blame and was a major factor that cost him his presidency.

He was and still is a great man, following him through his tour of the US was interesting, I am still amazed that such a great and moral person who actually cares for people and isn't blinded by race or religion ever got elected.

I am a great fan of Jimmy Carter, one of the two greatest living men on earth (the other being Nelson Mandela).  This film basically follows him throughout the country on a book tour of his controversial tome on the policies of Israel toward Palestineans.  What I like about this work is its intimate portrait of a man who inspires great respect in some and rabid hatred in others.  That fact is dramatically driven home when Carter is confronted by a very hostile man who obviously has much disdain for the him.  But there are also many people who show great reverence for the former President as he candidly discusses politically explosive matters related to the Middle East.

Jonathan Demme, over the years, has progressively abandoned mainstream and fictional films, committing himself to documentaries about music and social/political issues.
Here he deals with maybe the american president who has been most reconsidered after his administration. A simple man with clear and brave ideas, who's never been afraid of telling the truth, even when if didn't make public opinion happy.
Here, those two men, walk together through Carter's struggle against america's prejudice about Palestine and middle east. They even call him an anti-semite, when he simply tries to rebalance the discussion around this subject, calling for human rights and peace.
And so, by showing this trip through the states, you get to know him better, and discover the other side of the brilliant director who came with him",1402704000,3,982,5.4605263157894735

The Israeli colonization of these lands is bad for the peace process.

For that matter, as I thought while viewing the 2007 documentary JIMMY CARTER: MAN FROM PLAINS, compare Jimmy Carter's post-White House years to that of the presidents who followed.  Which do the dirty work with Habitat for Humanity and which take anywhere from $100,000 to $750,000 to give a speech?  Hint: One to whom the former applies is the same ex-president who dares point to the elephant in the room by writing the book PALESTINE: PEACE NOT APARTHEID.

Carter's world tour promoting that 2006 book comprises the lion's share of JIMMY CARTER: MAN FROM PLAINS.  Leave it to director Jonathan Demme, a man who appreciates the spunky be it Melvin Dummar, Clarice Starling, or, in this case, America's 39th president, to portray the essence of forging on because, well, somebody has to do what's right.  Those who think they know everything about the Middle East will learn otherwise, as will those who think they know everything about Jimmy Carter.

3304857,3,B0011VIO64,"""Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains"" is not a biography of the 39th President of the United States; nor is it a chronicle of his time as President, or even of his work with Habitat for Humanities, though both are touched upon in the course of the film.  Rather it is a documentary account of a national book tour Carter conducted in late 2006 to promote his controversial and provocatively entitled tome, ""Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.""  Carter basically gives two reasons why he felt compelled to write the book:  1) the fact that there had been no peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians in the then- five or six years of the Bush administration, and 2) what he sees as the unfair treatment of the Palestinians who live in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Anyone daring (or foolish) enough to venture into this minefield of a topic risks detonating intense passions on both sides of the conflict, but Carter's history and reputation as a peacemaker between the two aggrieved parties would appear to give him some cover on the issue.  Well, not exactly, for we see many, mostly pro-Israeli groups and individuals, protesting and challenging him as he travels around the country providing interviews on this hyper-sensitive subject.

As a movie, ""Jimmy Carter: Man From Plains"" is no more than serviceable, even though it comes with an impressive pedigree, namely Jonathan Demme for a director.  It is obviously sympathetic to Carter's position and it nicely illustrates the basic decency and humanity of a man who has hit the pinnacle of power yet still manages to remain true to the small town values of humility and service on which he was raised.  But it's also unimaginative and redundant, and probably isn't going to do much to assuage the concerns of those who hold opposing views to his.

It's worth seeing for its historical significance though.",1342828800,,1867,4.864353312302839

At first I thought it a standard broadcast documentary missing only the voice of God narrator, but on reviewing it I saw each scene was a different aspect of Jimmy Carter. Using old footage Demme points to the Herculean effort Jimmy Carter invested in the Egyptian-Isreali peace agreement. His work building houses shows Jimmy Carter as a man trying to help people who need it. Either from the perspective of those interested in learning more about Jimmy Carter, or from those seeking a masterclass in documentary making I recommend this film.  Although I am a different person with different views than Jimmy Carter this film  helped me see president Carter as a  caring man, a finer man than history sees him--Demme even explains that in terms of an unfortunate hostage outcome.  Jimmy Carter is outside the ex presidents club in a way.  Maybe that's because, as this film shows him, he is a spiritual and caring man seeking to be just and loving.

Others have reviewed those aspects of the film, so I'll skip ahead to one scene that's not being talked about.  In Chapter 6 of the DVD, there's a brillant mixture of modern debate and old footage of the Camp David meetings. Its not a terribly long scene at all, no more than 10 or 15 minutes, but it is stunningly brillant and shows the deep divisions in the Middle East.  Well worth it for that moment alone.

Unfortunately, this Jonathan Demme film focuses almost entirely on Carter's 2006 tour promoting his book ""Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid"" and the uproar it spurred.  Carter comes across as courageous, principled and (usually) very patient in the face of the same questions asked over and over again by modestly informed interviewers.  The controversy offers plenty of insight into Carter's character and beliefs, but it's only one aspect of his career.

Demme fills a lot of space with scenes of Carter getting on and off planes, riding in cars, carrying his suitcase, getting makeup applied for interviews, etc.  Comparatively little use is made of archival footage, except for a brief but engaging segment on the Camp David negotiations.

Maybe it was justified, but maybe not.
Probably not from a Christian perspective I would think.
Worst president ever?
Only a wingnut, rightwinger jag- off could spew that slogan out.
Regardless of to what extent Jimmy Carter was indeed a failure as a president, he has undeniably done a lotta good since returning to life as a ""private"" citizen. He's a busy bee alright and lookin' at him in this film you have to hope you'll be going that strong in your 80s. He's a likable guy. And boy is he religious. Jimmy Carter ""worst president"" to wingnuts is a devout Christian. Not for pretend. Reads the Bible every single night with his wife of well over 50 years of marriage. And when he is on the road, which is a lot, they each read the same parts before going to bed. Anyway, really a most  unfortuante and unintended profound result of Carter's presidential campaign way back in '76 was the birth of the political religious Right. His speaking openly of his ""born again"" trip woke up a slouching beast and the result has been a total disaster for America. Oh well. Really no making up for that. He wrote a book dealing with that issue. The roots of the political machine that helped create Dubya has it's beginnings with the good Christian peanut farmer from the plains.

What's most interesting about this doc on Carter is that Demme and crew (""Silence of the Lams"") follow Carter around after he commits treason and morphs into wicked ""liar"" and obviously an anti-Semitic, Israel hating terrorist lover. For real. See it for yourself. After his book _Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid_ Jimmy Carter came under intense fire.

The book's deliberately provocative title was designed to spark discussion, and the thrust of the 2007 film is to show the media-intensified firestorm Carter faced as a result.

To his immense credit, Demme lets Carter speak for himself in the film and doesn't allow a narrator to provide color commentary on the former president's hectic touring schedule. What comes across is a man rightfully proud of the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, and has most recently taken to heart his sense of responsibility as a private citizen and former leader to share the devastation he has seen the Palestinians experience in the occupied areas cut off from the rest of the world. It's an arc that Demme explores through an effective use of archival footage, interviews with key figures (including Carter's wife of 62 years, Rosalynn, who speaks movingly about what led Menachem Begin to sign the final treaty), and the robust, even-keeled presence Carter maintains throughout despite what seems to be a dizzying pace and the consistent critical onslaught. Much of Carter's politic demeanor can be attributed to his faith, including nightly Bible readings with Rosalynn (no matter where he is), but Demme also shows the discipline Carter employs with his handlers and in his regular regimen of swimming laps.

It's definitely a favorable impression of the former president, which is unlikely to sit well with detractors who view him as a treasonous rabble-rouser, but the effect is understandable given that some of Carter's more vocal opponents refused to be filmed, including Dr. Kenneth Stein, who resigned as a Carter Center fellow (of whom Carter dismissed as an absentee member), and a roomful of protesting rabbi elders in Phoenix. Fortunately, renowned Harvard professor and attorney Alan Dershowitz is included as one of the most vocal opponents of Carter's book. His fair-minded comments provide a critical counterbalance to the positive image of Carter, and interestingly, it is never really explained why Carter would not face Dershowitz in a public debate at Brandeis University, who initially turned down Carter's proposal to lecture for free. Intriguingly, Demme takes a behind-the-scenes approach to the various media interviews, whether it's Terry Gross, Charlie Rose, Wolf Blitzer, or Tavis Smiley. In turn, Carter expertly modulates his points to fit the format, including an amusingly deadpan confession to Jay Leno on who really wears the pants in the Carter marriage.

Demme also incorporates the other key priorities in Carter's life to provide more dimension to the portrait - his dedicated work on Habitat for Humanity and as caretaker of the land his family has owned for nearly two centuries around Plains. The parts of the film that drag unnecessarily are more logistical in nature - traveling repeatedly with his kowtowing Simon & Schuster publicist and preparing the customers for the book signings. At 125 minutes, the film runs a mite long and could have benefited from another editing session. Extras are plentiful on the 2008 DVD starting with over thirty minutes of additional scenes and a half-hour featurette on the making of the soundtrack. Neither feels essential though an extended sequence showing a signing at Costco brought out a perturbed woman who tersely told Carter he should be tried for treason. Demme and producer Neda Armian also contribute a very thoughtful commentary track. Trailers for ten other Sony Classics films on DVD complete the extras.",1208476800,2,5101,6.222379603399434

The film makers follow President Carter as he tours to promote his book, ""Palestine Peace Not Apartheid,"" which shined a light on Israel's violations of Palestinians' basic human rights, and inflamed animosity among Israel's supporters in the United States.

Having witnessed, on a visit to the Occupied Territories, the Israeli military bulldozing Palestinian homes because Israel's leaders want the Palestinian land but not their kind in the Jewish state, I can vouch for the accuracy of Carter's criticisms of Israel.  Critics of President Carter's book, as shown in the film, apparently cannot refute his facts; therefore, they must resort to ad hominem attacks.

It is enlightening about the human condition to observe prominent critics badgering Carter about a book they have not read; and a woman accusing the former President of the United States of treason, presumably because he exhibited insufficient loyalty to her favorite foreign country (this clip is in the special features).

""Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains"" affords a rare opportunity to watch a prominent octogenarian statesman speak the truth about an unpopular cause, sometimes to antagonistic audiences, calmly parrying vituperative attacks with reason and facts. One short segment in the film, as Carter draws on a notepad the Occupied Territories and notes the location of the wall and the Israeli ""settlements"" throughout Palestinian land, is more informative about the source of the conflict than a year's worth of coverage on CNN. I highly recommend the film, which is artfully directed, and the special features, which are as interesting as the clips included in the film.",1207785600,3,1829,5.2534246575342465

If you read the book you will quickly see that although not a Zionist, Carter is FAR from being anti-semetic. There isn't a US leader out there with more friends in Israel or who has spent as much time and energy there.  And it is truly horrific to see these insults being unfairly hurled at such a man of peace.

It is fascinating to watch the events unfold throughout his tour to promote his book- Palestine, Peace Not Apartheid.

3304878,5,B0011VIO64,"Anyone who had access to television news in 2006 will remember the storm of controversy following the publication of former President Jimmy Carter's book, ""Palestine: Peace, Not Apartheid.""  This film recalls those days in great detail and reminds us that many  of the book's critics had not even bothered to read it before denouncing it.

I predict that many of the same critics of that book and Carter's even-handed position on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict will return to denounce Jonathan Demme's film without ever bothering to see it.  They will continue to assert that Israel is completely innocent of creating anything that could be considered an apartheid situation.  Their hope is that people will ignore Carter's simple request that everyone take the time to look at the facts on the ground before automatically taking the Israeli side in this long-standing dispute.  Anyone who does so can at least then agree that the walls constructed by Israel encroach in many places onto long-held Palestinian lands.

Carter points out in several instances in the film that Israel certainly has the right to defend itself and its borders against terrorist attacks; his objection is to the locations where the walls have been built and the manner in which they have been used to house the Palestinians as virtual prisoners.  It is much easier for the critics to simply assume that Carter is anti-Israeli.  I submit that any honest viewer of the film cannot maintain such an opinion of him.

Even those who might disagree with Carter's positions would have to be amazed at the sheer level of energy shown in the film on the part of this eighty-three year old man who seems willing to speak anytime, anywhere in defense of his views.  In viewing the film, I was encouraged to see the respectful response that he received when speaking before what might have been expected to be a hostile audience at Brandeis.  On the other hand, my hopes were tempered by the young street protestor in the film who took great delight in shouting to Palestinians and their supporters that, ""Nobody cares about you.""",1206576000,17,2097,4.943019943019943

Carter refused to let any of his generals or special ops take the fall and insisted on 100% blame and was a major factor that cost him his presidency.

He was and still is a great man, following him through his tour of the US was interesting, I am still amazed that such a great and moral person who actually cares for people and isn't blinded by race or religion ever got elected.

I actually felt a bit saddened watching a man freak out on Carter,  love him or hate him you can't help but respect him and all that he has accomplished, and for the record, I have been a life long republican myself, minus my first vote for Mr. Carter when he was defeated by Regan.",1203897600,16,1114,4.477832512315271

The parade of personalities, Terry Gross, Diane Rheims, and others, gets tiresome.  The newly-completed film by Andrew Young is much better!",1417132800,,303,4.921568627450981
