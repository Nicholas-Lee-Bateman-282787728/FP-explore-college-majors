8355278,4,B0027ZH9IC,"This well acted late 1950s (1959 to be exact) British drama was one of two films which ""featured"" British rock and roller Cliff Richard. (The other was Espresso Bongo.) But he really has a small role here with only a few lines of dialogue and three songs. Actually he only performs one complete and the others are curtailed when action occurs. Still the first 30 minutes gives a nice feel for ""teenage rock and roll"" in the 50s. But that's not the main plot here. As you will probably see by the plot summary or other reviews, this is about a new Vicar who moves into a community and later has to face charges of ""inappropriate behavior"". The British - where the Church is even more powerful than in the US - were years ahead of American films in broaching the subject.

Though I had seen Espresso Bongo years ago, this film was new to me and the print from VCI is clean and sharp with great sound.

Sure it's a ""period piece"" (the late 50s) but the story is interesting, with a few nice turns, the acting well done, and it'll certainly hold your attention. The Richard performances may lead you to the film, but you'll stay for the story and the acting.

There's a fun six-minute collage of British film trailers to the soundtrack of a new British pop song that preceded the feature. Nice added touch!

8355279,5,B0027ZH9IC,"There was a time when it was hard to sit through a British film. They were well, foreign.
They were full of chatty Brits talking with nose-in-your-face smugness. Often the topics
covered were so mundane, one has to ask ""Really, you want me to sit through 2 hours of
this?"" What brand of duct tape are you using to tape me down?

""Serious Charge"" is actually quite chatty too. But you'll be chatty too if you are Stanley
Baker and you are a priest and some young punk accuses you of ""touching"" him. Gawd, it
violates all the rules of the Church and it is, dare we say it, intergenerational sex. The
movie predates ""The Children's Hour"" (or ""The Loudest Whisper"" in Britain) where some kid
sez nuns Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine are of the Lesbos persuasion.

Cliff Richard made two serious movies (sorry about that) at the start of his career, the
other being ""Expresso Bongo"". And he sings some good numbers in this.",1252972800,,922,4.548192771084337
