They were similar to Kenpo, but different. I thought I would find a wealth of information I could add to my Kenpo techniques, but I was sorely disappointed. Almost everything had to do with fighting dealt with using their feet. The techniques they showed, used the feet to block and actually grab the arm. It definitely could not be used at all. But if you like the idea of using your feet like hands, then this is an excellent DVD for you.",1428019200,,608,4.4375
