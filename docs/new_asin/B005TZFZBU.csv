4893583,5,B005TZFZBU,"I felt really bad for the families in this movie. The actual method used in this film to end ones life looks like a fairly peaceful way to go. I think others should not judge people who are dying of an incurable, painful disease and want to use the methods depicted in this film to end their suffering. I don't understand the difference between taking so much morphine for pain that you MAY stop breathing or taking the barbiturates used in this film that hastens and insures the end of your stay here on planet earth? The end of life option used by people in this film looks like the more logical one to take from my perspective. That is if you have the cash and live in Oregon.",1340236800,,679,4.271317829457364
4893584,5,B005TZFZBU,"Death is shunned in our society. We do everything to avoid it. And yet, it is as akin to life as life itself, and is a part of the experience that can be one of our greatest teachers. Death with dignity is not about killing people or violating universal free will--in fact it is about bringing humanity back to death. Billions of dollars and millions of hours of pain are spent in keeping people alive that are ready to go. Only an individual knows when that time is, and with proper planning and documentation, Oregon has provided a powerful statement and practice for those who would rather save themselves the unnecessary pain and suffering, and that of their families, as well as the financial atrocities that can occur in prolonged intensive need terminal illness. Making friends with death as a natural process not be feared helps us to live our lives fully, recognizing the preciousness of each moment--for nothing is guaranteed.

The poignance of Cody Curtis's story in this excellent documentary, and of the wife of a husband with ALS, moved me to tears. This shows the first hand struggles and humanity of real people facing death.

I appreciate the continued efforts that Oregonians have made to stay dedicated to human rights and encourage everyone to see this film.",1338681600,15,1278,4.831050228310502
4893585,5,B005TZFZBU,"Thoughtful, kind, well-made film. Several years ago when my husband was diagnosed with inoperable cancer, he decided to live out his life without chemo and radiation. He had witnessed a friend make use of the DWD act and was present at bedside, with others, as his friend - very much at peace - surrendered his own life. My husband and I went through the complicated proceedure of procuring the medications for him to do the same. Ultimately, he chose not to make use of the meds, which, in fact, is what most people do. Losing all control over one's life is among a dying person's fears. The DWD act returns a sense of control and, thus, the dignity that accompanies it. No matter what your beliefs, expand your horizons, watch the film and learn something important.",1338422400,6,768,4.654411764705882
4893586,5,B005TZFZBU,"A masterful, sensitive, powerful documentary about a difficult subject. Peter Richardson shows how truly great a thoughtful, compassionate documentary can be. Quite a contrast to the sort of fear-mongering, hectoring, histrionics, and rabble-rousing you've come to expect in recent popular documentaries. Whatever Richardson turns his attention to next, he's got my attention already.",1323907200,27,384,6.264150943396227
4893587,4,B005TZFZBU,"The brutality of self-inflicted murder is more painful than anything one may experience as a cancer patient. Modernity has eviscerated our ability to understand suffering and its potential for our growth in holiness and self-denial. Science has made men gods and when our lightening bolts just fizzle we refuse to acknowledge our limitations and insist, at any cost, on having things our way. So when cancer treatments don't work, we think of ways to have death ""on our own terms."" As a revert to the Catholic Church and a budding High School Theology teacher, I am beginning to see how the culture of death found in this death with dignity movement is very closely linked with abortion and contraception. All this  does not take away from the deep sadness and compelling stories told in this documentary, but sadness and suffering simply do not give one a pass to kill oneself, nor does it allow a society the freedom to deny the true dignity of man by officially endorsing suicide with the full weight and authority of the State. This is a complex discussion worthy of significant and lengthy public discourse, unfortunately we no longer live in a society that bothers with meaningful public discourse (talk radio is a joke and television news ""debates"" are also a farce).",1319846400,5,1274,4.870967741935484
4893588,5,B005TZFZBU,"Diana's review of this film is spot-on. If you have the 21 dollars, buy this film. If you're a brain-dead zombie who believes ending your life early is a sin, you'll get a good look into what these people actually go through. If you're somewhat intelligent, you may gain some understanding on the issue and change your mind. If you were brainwashed by your parents and church as a kid, you're probably just wasting your time. For you people who oppose the Act: Stop forcing your beliefs on people.",1319846400,10,497,4.595505617977528
4893589,5,B005TZFZBU,"No matter what your moral leanings are on physician-assisted suicide, ""How to Die in Oregon"" will give you an angle on the issue that shows grace and compassion.  It's hard to imagine a film that takes on this hot-button issue and does not evoke anger, anxiety or doubt.  Somehow the producer has helped the viewer to avoid the negative and raw emotions and find a place of empathy and resignation.

There is no fanfare in death and dying and the issue in this film is not treated with drama and stigma.  Much a part of living, death is dealt with lovingly and respectfully.  Those individuals featured in ""How to Die in Oregon"" who let us into the most intimate parts and decisions of their lives (especially Cody Curtis) leave us understanding quality of life just a little bit better.

Whether you believe in Oregon's historic ""Death with Dignity Act"" or flatly oppose it ... watch this film to gain a little more empathy and understanding.  It is my hope that this film is watched, discussed and embraced by more people.  This is an issue that needs to be broached more than ever these days as medical advances continue that allow for length of life without true quality.

5 stars for a very touching, thoughtful an poignant film.",1319500800,40,1234,4.649769585253456

The lady at the end of this film seemed to have an easier end of life than people in my family who have died but did so with far too much suffering. I did not find this depressing or as sad as I might have thought. It just sounds so intuitive to allow people this right and free their families from the post-death memories of their loved ones having suffered.

4893626,2,B005TZFZBU,"How to Die in Oregon is a documentary introducing patients with terminal illnesses who kill themselves with lethal doses of barbiturate made legal by the passage of Measure 16 in Oregon in 1994 and Proposition 1000 in Washington in 2008.
The film begins with scene of an elderly gentleman in what looks like a family room with large windows looking out into his yard. He is sitting on the edge of a bed in his tee shirt and jockey shorts and is clearly uncomfortable about something and anxious to initiate his suicide. He states emphatically that he understands what he is doing. We watch him drink the lethal solution made by emptying the contents of many barbiturate capsules into water. He is surrounded by a number of people but we do not know their relationship to him. The movie then goes on to introduce others dying of various illnesses. They explain their circumstance and why they endorse euthanasia. We also meet Sue Porter, a volunteer with the organization Compassion and Choices that provides medical, legal, and end of life options for free. She pretty much sums up the underlying theme of the whole film when she tells a dying patient that you are the boss. You have lost so much controland you want control from the medicine.
A number of commonly held beliefs are expressed through the words of the various patients, including:
 I would rather go when I am feeling reasonably good
 We euthanize animals when they are dying (why not people?)
 Harm = taking away your control; control = choosing when to die
 Why suffer the morbidity of chemotherapy for minimal benefit?
 Concern about being a burden to others
 Concern about the expense of a terminal illness
The heroine of the film is a lady named Cody who has hepatic carcinoma, undergoes a resection, but has recurrent disease that does not respond to chemotherapy. We see her do so well initially that she feels guilty that she has exceeded the prognostic expectations of her medical oncologist.  But eventually the cancer continues its inexorable growth and we see her struggling with the consequences of worsening ascites (anorexia, weight loss, weakness, dyspnea).  She expresses a number of heartfelt (and ambivalent) thoughts as we walk with her through the last few months of her life, including:
 I want to be a model of grace and acceptance for my children
 I am worried I will be a coward at the end (of my lifeand not be up to the act of euthanasia)
 I would rather just drift away in my sleepperhaps I should not treat my fever (recurrent sepsis from ascending cholangitis) with antibiotics
 Her husband: (it would be best if) she could gracefully just 'let nature take its course'
The Compassion and Choices volunteer/advocate tries to reassure her by forcefully saying that the statement that the truly courageous are those willing to suffer the most is an absolutely, totally erroneous and completely flawed philosophy and logicthere is no logic to that. And you are lucky to know (that you are dying) and have control over it (via the opportunity to commit suicide).""
In the rather macabre final scene we watch the shadows of the family gathered around Cody through an opaque window from outside their home as they sing some songs togetherand as a helper prepares and delivers her lethal barbiturate cocktail. She drinks itsays it is really easyand then all becomes quiet. It's a long six minute segment.

This film basically asks the viewer to answer the most basic existential question: What is the meaning of life and, once you have answered that, how are you going to live your life consistently in response to that meaning? On the one hand if you fall into the secular humanist camp you view anything that detracts from what you define as living life well as something to be avoided. And if imminent death is approaching it makes sense to simply check out by your own hand--have control over the timing of that event--rather than to allow prolonged pain and suffering. On the other hand if you are a God-fearing person--and God IS love--then you trust that your benevolent Father, who has only your best interests at heart, will provide you with the physical, mental, psychological, relational, and spiritual tools to deal with the challenges of human existence in order to prepare yourself for an eternity of happiness with Him. Christianity in particular views suffering as something to be, yes, embraced as somehow allowing you to participate in that suffering that Jesus experienced during his passion and death in order to expiate the sins of all humanityone of the great ""mysteries"" of the Christian faith. Ergo, it is a morally inappropriate choice to kill oneself--understandable perhaps, but inappropriate.
As physicians and nurses we know that pain is a sensorial-cerebral event that can be mitigated by medication. Suffering on the other hand is the psychological response to a wide variety of unpleasant experiences, pain being only one of them. We can do a lot for painbut suffering is a much bigger challenge in that a key component of its amelioration is spiritual. This may occur directly, as God acts through ""grace"" to give us direction and strength, or indirectly through other people. And that is of course what we in the ""healing arts"" profession do through our understanding, compassion, and training : Remedy pain and suffering.
One final thought for ""believers"". The quality of our relationship with the Lord is, like human relationships, dependent upon frequent communication. And like any other skill you acquire proficiency through repetitive practice so that when a major challenge occurs you may rise to the occasion and prevail. In my experience of shepherding many patients as well as my parents and in-laws through the dying process this is particularly true at the end of life. As the Boy Scouts (and Girl Scouts?) would say: Be prepared! (Pray often!)
Thank you for the opportunity to respond.

Would it be any different if a soldier in war, looked to the left and he was going to be shot, then looked to the right and saw explosives, would it really matter if he decided to jump off the bridge in front of him? He would be choosing the lesser of two evils. He was going to die one way or another. My heart goes out to all the people who have been in this position to have to choose. God bless them all.

She seems like going out this way she gained so much out of her inevitable end. She got to die held and surrounded by loved ones, in whatever ways brought her the most comfort. How many get to say they had that?

I hope she found comfort in that. There always seems to be so much suffering, chaos, regret, and sometimes bitterness around terminal illness, incapacity, and death- Cody was able to manage her death well enough that the only sadness was in her passing.

I work in the medical field, I have seen patients be told they have incurable diseases, and I have seen what they go through and the level of decline and suffering they go through. I don't care what your religion is, this is not suicide! These people are dying anyways. It is simply ending any unessessary suffering and pain, for both the patients and the families. You wouldn't let your animals suffer, why would you let yor family members?

During  my next trip home, I doubt if I will ever look at Bi-Mart in the same light.

The production qualities of this documentary are nothing memorable.  My own nephew Brett Eichenberger, a filmmaker, likely could have produced something more stirring.

Overall, the film would have a lot more credibility with me if it showed a wider range of the socio-economic pie.

True, at the start of the film a dying man appeared to be of modest economic means and about half-way through a poor man from the Willamette Valley was featured briefly.  I am not quite sure what his role in the narrative might have been.  It did not seem to me that he was interested in physician-assisted suicide, only not ""getting screwed"" by the medico-political establishment.

The ""star"" of the film is obviously an up-market kind of woman, with a beautiful home in an up-and-coming neighborhood.

It was an eye-opening topic - people with terminal illness who are in intense pain, with no way to relieve the pain and no possible way of surviving the illness, make the decision to end their lives by using a mixture of drugs prescribed by their doctor.  The film shows those groups of people who oppose the law that enables people to obtain the drugs to end their lives, however, as you get to ""know"" several of the patients, you understand why they chose to end their lives.

But this was a great documentary that explored thru the lives of terminally ill patients, along with their doctors, friends and family, the issues and questions around a patient deciding when they've had enough. The option is available only to patients with 6 months or less left to live. They have the right to a prescription for a lethal cocktail that they can choose to fillor not.and administer.or not.

Once you get yourself invested in some of the people in this movie, you take on a compassion for humanity. I thoroughly enjoyed Peter Richardson's fly on the wall perspective of what it's like to be in the lives of a family facing this final journey with their loved one. It was ironic that it took place from spring until winter's edge. It was beautifully done and you could tell that they were a true family much like any family. There were other stories mixed into this documentary that were of great interest as well. Like the birth of the death with dignity act in another state besides Oregon as well as a few others including a locally famous person and one point of view that take a different angle altogether. The thought of death is definitely sad, but the people who were able to seize the choice were definitely happy when their end came. I saw this awhile back and still think about it all the time.

As a ""Baby Boomer"", I am part of a large generation that increasingly faces the kinds of difficult questions raised in this film. I would recommend this video to anyone. I would hope it can be used to inform people and help grow compassionate choice campaigns in other states.

4893751,5,B005TZFZBU,"I can't express how difficult it was to watch this documentary. It's one thing to know that with a birth there will also be death, such is the cycle of life. However, death comes with ""old age"", that's the natural stage of such a cycle and we accept the inevitable finality of death.

Because of terminal illness or due to injury when our bodies are so wrecked in pain and medical science can no longer cure or fix our ailments, nor can it relieve the pain, we are now able to choose to end the suffering. And this ironically and oddly enough, is a gift to our families. As cruel as some may think that may be, would you be more happy if your family member lived just to be a martyr? Would anyone be happy to see that person cry out for days or weeks in pain until finally dead?

I've read some of the comments stating preference in allowing death to come naturally as ""God chose it"" while condemning those that have chosen Death with Dignity. It's okay to admit your discomfort in the matter. However, just accept the fact that not everyone is willing to participate in ""religious guilt"". People are willing to think for themselves and not become martyrs.

So yes. Death with Dignity is certainly final and only to those that are terminal. Your approval is neither needed nor required. You opinion, like mine, has no bearing. How absolutely fantastic. This decision is so intimate and private I felt privileged to have glimpsed a part of it.

If ever I have the unfortunate health issues that such a process may have to be considered, may I have the courage to leave this world with Dignity and Love.",1394841600,9,1601,4.472602739726027
4893752,3,B005TZFZBU,"to me it says more about the current situation (state of affairs) in this country, than choosing death with dignity. While certain diseases have been eradicated/cured over the last century, it seems there is more illness and death than ever. What is the cause?, -Industrialization? Pollution? Pesticides? Electromagnetic radiation? It seems that no one is doing any research into the cause of these diseases (such as Cancer). The medical establishment, government, and pharmaceutical industry, are perfectly happy with the increasing prevalence of these diseases, as long as they are profiting financially from them; as is all the corporations whose activities could be the cause and culprit. We are simply marching on with technological progress, with total disregard for the heavy price that is paid. There is this selfishness people have, that as long as it isn't them, or as long as they're making money, -they don't care about collateral damage or other people and their suffering. We export this to other countries (such as China), so we can have inexpensive electronics, or items from WalMart. Our nation, our thought process, and what we value, are totally ass-backwards, and immoral. Such is the life I guess, that we feel we cannot change (or don't want to). Cannabis Oil cures Cancer and most other diseases, and it is the corporate greed and corruption of government and industry which prevents people from healing themselves (with it).",1394496000,2,1448,5.218884120171674

It broke down the idea of death and dying from the view point of the terminally ill, which is an often ignored viewpoint. As a healthcare provider, I'm in the hospital fighting for people's lives. This documentary really made me step back and look at how much control these people and their families have lost when they are in hospital. They are told when they can eat, drink, sleep, take their medications, even when they can get out of bed. Death with dignity gives them some of that control back... which can make all the difference in how a person perceives their end of life. It's less scary (and often far less painful) when you have some control of it. This documentary was incredibly eye opening to a subject that is often uncomfortable for people to talk about and so often ignored in conversations until it is too late. I hope this changes that.

My main thoughts after watching it however, are... The one thing none of these people tried first (at least it was never noted in the film if they did) is Cannabis.  I believe in the right to die in Oregon for sure, or any other state for that matter.  I also believe in the right to live, and I'm amazed that none of them tried Cannabis as a possible means to live and improve the quality of life, before they chose to die.  That is the only thing that makes me sad for them and/or their families.  Cannabis has saved many at death's door and improved their quality of life immensely.  In a state as open to medical marijuana as Oregon is, I sincerely hope people will opt to try to live and enjoy life with Cannabis, before choosing death.

The movie tackles a very important and interesting topic: end of life decisions for the terminally ill. The topic is somewhat divisive and there are a lot of opinion on it. The movie tries to hit both sides of the debate but clearly the movie is one sided and sides with the opinion that people should be able to choose to end their own lives. I am not saying that I don't agree with that opinion, I am just saying that the movie is biased towards that side, thats all. The movie follows a few people, all of whom are terminally ill and have chosen to end their own lives with the help of their doctors. The movie gets into their lives and you really get an idea of the enormity of their decision and the effect it has on their families. The main person that the movie follows is a very likable and sweet women who has cancer. You see her get worse and worse and you see how she and her family and friends deal with it. Its very emotional.

All in all, I would highly recommend this movie. Be warned that its very sad and will put you in a bit of a down mood. However, I found that oddly enough the movie made me appreciate life a lot more. I would have thought that a movie like this would depress me, which it did, but that slowly faded into appreciation for my life and my circumstances.

4893796,5,B005TZFZBU,"This 2011 documentary film about the Oregon Death with Dignity Act won the Grand Jury prize for documentary film at the 27th Sundance Film Festival. Although a documentary, it is far from dry, and neither will you remain dry-eyed while watching it. But this is hardly surprising given that it addresses the highly emotional subject of death and dying, and the emotionally-charged beliefs around the right to choose a dignified death when faced with a terminal diagnosis.

The opening scene seems quite ordinary: a woman standing at the kitchen sink, mixing powder in a glass of water. One quickly understands that this person is a volunteer with Compassion and Choices, and that she is mixing a lethal medication for an elderly terminally ill patient who has voluntarily chosen to die by self-administering this medication. The demeanor of the volunteer, the terminally ill patient, and the family member seems equally pragmatic and ordinary as mixing a glass of water, but we understand that this act has profound and truly incalculable significance.

This film gives viewers a raw and honest look at the surreal and yet ordinary lives of over a dozen people in diverse circumstances who have chosen to utilize Oregon's Death with Dignity Act and voluntarily take their own life. It is surreal because unless you have personally experienced being in such a situation, nothing can prepare you for it; it is ordinary because death is part of life and we all will die. There are, of course, legal criteria to be in compliance with this law and to protect physicians from being held liable: 1) two doctors must independently certify that the person has 6 months or less to live; 2) two people must witness the the patient's request to their physician for a prescription for the lethal medication, and 3) the patient must be able to self-administer; and 4) the patient must be of sound mind. And of course, the patient has the right to change their mind, at any time.

The film presents views from both sides of the right-to-die-with-dignity fence, but the main thrust of this fine film is to tread gently and with great sensitivity into people's lives as they move toward their conscious desire to die humanely. Talk about reality TV! It is both disconcerting and reassuring to get an inside view of how the Death with Dignity Act looks in real life. As someone who went through Hospice with my own mother less than a year ago, I know that if I had been able to see a film about how Hospice care actually plays out in the day-to-day, I would have been so much better prepared and could have been an even better caretaker for my mom. The people who agreed to take part in How To Die in Oregon have given each of us a great gift in sharing such intimate and sacred moment in their lives, and with this film, filmmaker Peter Richardson has placed Oregon once again at the forefront of shifting awareness about attitudes toward death and practices around dying.",1360108800,3,2954,4.765625

4893798,5,B005TZFZBU,"This was the second saddest documentary I've ever seen, behind Dear Zachary. I heaved and sobbed at the end. I fully support the Death with Dignity act, as someone who worked in the death industry for five years. I've seen terrible suffering, both from the terminally ill who did everything they could to survive and the terminally ill who took it upon themselves to check out early (and usually it wasn't in a peaceful way like the medicine they take in this film). I really respect the families who allowed a camera crew to record such an intimate, private event. I think it presented an irrefutable argument on the side of doctor-assisted suicide. No one should be forced to suffer if death is inevitable. I hope the rest of the country is able to catch up with Oregon's progressive law some day.",1359244800,15,799,4.633802816901408

I was told long time ago that if my mother had an abortion, I would not be here. Well if an individual is already here then shouldn't that person have the right to choose what is quality or dignity when it is in regard to his/her own life, when that person is not harming the public and his/her death has nothing to do with others... Why are words like dignity or humanity even necessary...

4893808,5,B005TZFZBU,"Lucky people of Oregon get to choose to die easily with dignity when they are given six months to live by their physicians.  I have seen friends and family die agonizing slow painful deaths with morphine in hospitals, to the maximum level, which didn't touch the pain they were feeling, hooked to machines.  As this film shows, there is a better alternative for those who choose it, if they are Oregon residents.

This was an excellent documentary about Oregonians' right to choose painless suicide.
It's hard to watch this without feeling that this should be the law of the land.
The film follows two people who are very ill and dying, as they make the difficult decision to end thier own lives painlessly with barbiturates.

It was interesting that both said as almost their last words ""this is so easy"", with tones of great relief in their voices.  Actually, the exact last words of one man who was dying slowly of Lou Gherig's disease were, ""tell people, this is so easy"".  They simply drifted off to sleep.  This slowly dying man had said in the preceeding days that he kept drifting in and out of his body, and each time he started to come back he kept wondering how he could stay out of his body, because he was so sick and in so much pain.

This emotional subject was portrayed sensitively in this masterful documentary.
Everyone in the country should see this.  Then they need to ask themselves what they would want if they were suffering terribly with a terminal disease, or if their loved ones were.
If they would choose the hospital machines in intensive care route that would be their perogative.
But if they would choose the easy way out, that too should be their perogative.

This is a very good documentary about an important subject.  It shows the state of Oregon in a very positive light for it's compassion for the dying.  Oregon voters have spoken.",1343347200,,1868,4.627272727272727
4893809,5,B005TZFZBU,"The subject of How To Die In Oregon is Oregon's Death With Dignity Act, which was passed in 1994 and upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 2006. Oregon was the first state to pass this kind of law. The film opens with a crotchety cancer patient named Roger drinking his lethal dose of Seconal and laying down to await his death.

After that we meet Cody Curtis, a woman in her fifties with terminal liver cancer. When she first appears on camera, she looks healthy and happy. The film follows her decline and how she makes her decision about when it's time for her to take her life. The filmmaker made a good decision in choosing Cody - she is smart, sensitive, articulate and lovable. I have a HUGE fear of death - my living will basically says keep me alive at all costs. But listening to Cody speak about what dying with dignity means and seeing how she was using her time before her death actually made me understand why someone with a terminal illness would want to choose their date of death.

This film also follows a woman from the state of Washington whose husband died of cancer. At the time he was dying, Washington did not have a Death With Dignity Act. Even though he wanted to take his life before his suffering got too bad, he was not able to. I think hearing about how things were for this man at the end will be eye-opening for a lot of people who do not realize how bad things can get at the end. It's more than just pain. For instance, this man could not ever close his eyes because his brain tumor was pushing his eyeballs out.

Before he died, he asked his wife to please help make it so that other terminally ill people in Washington would not have to suffer as he did. The film follows his wife's journey working trying to get a Death With Dignity bill passed in Washington.

I'm really glad I decided to watch this film. I learned so much about terminal illness and how to truly die with dignity. I definitely came away with a new perspective on death. I highly recommend How To Die In Oregon.",1342310400,5,2024,4.318421052631579

I echo many other reviewers here when I say this movie made me cry, and not just cry; weep, and shake, and pace the room with my head in my hands.  I cried almost without stopping during the whole thing and kept crying all the way through the end credits. This is by a million miles the saddest and most affecting film I've ever seen.  Coming into it as a bit of a fence-sitter on the idea of physician assisted suicide, I finished the film as a staunch defender of Death with Dignity laws. I'm proud to live in Oregon, where human compassion has overridden politics and religion and given families in their darkest, most desperate moments of pain and despair, a rational and humane way out.  How terrible for people who aren't given this same choice, simply because of where they happen to live?

I have been in the position where Ive seen people suffer and not even pain medication can provide relief. I have held hands of those who tell me they wish they could die with dignity but because of the laws we have that isn't doable. Instead the healthcare system declares us to keep forcing medication in their bodies and perform procedures for temporary relief. This film just shows everyone should have a choice.

I have nothing but love and kind thoughts for the people that participated in the documentary, in the making of, and Oregon, in allowing these opportunities of choice. It's important to note, I hope that people will understand that the decisions of others shouldn't be dictated by your own personal beliefs and the opportunity for people to make decisions for their own bodies.",1498348800,,736,4.5
