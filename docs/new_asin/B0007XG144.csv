8053388,3,B0007XG144,"A writer named Francois Rollin (Claude Brasseur) is walking on a beach in Nice, when he runs across a beautiful woman named Peggy Lister (Mireille Darc). Falling instantly, madly in love w/ her, Francois haunts Peggy until she finally relents, giving him her address. When the two begin hanging out together, Francois finds out that he's gotten himself involved in far more than a romance. Peggy's life is much more complicated than Francois could imagine. She seems to be under constant surveillance. Her attorney, Marc Rilson (Alain Delon) finally tells Francois about Peggy's mental problems and drug addiction! Rilson also tells him that Peggy murdered her husband. Francois believes none of it, and returns immediately to his romantic pursuit. This could prove to be a... bad decision. Of course, Peggy's version is a bit different, casting her more as a victim of circumstance. Are Rilson and his cohorts really trying to help Peggy, or are they up to something sinister? ICY BREASTS (aka: SOMEONE IS BLEEDING) is a French suspense / thriller from 1974. As such, it's somewhat slow, and while there is murder and madness, it's sparse. Those accustomed to a faster pace may think of it as tedious. I found it semi-interesting, fairly entertaining, and rather odd. Based on a book by Richard Matheson. Worth checking out once...",1422057600,2,1332,5.0590909090909095
8053389,4,B0007XG144,"This was a really strange movie, but Alain Delon looks really great in it, and if you are a fan, it's worth watching it just for him.",1394236800,,133,3.962962962962963
8053390,3,B0007XG144,"Very bad sound !!! The movie itself is so so, but worth seeing thanks to Delon ...... Rest of the cast, incl M. Darc do not show anything above the average.......",1356566400,,162,4.258064516129032
8053391,2,B0007XG144,"The trouble with punning titles is that they rarely translate. Case in point Les Seins de Glace aka Icy Breasts, a play on the chilly few days of Les Saints de Glace, which at least suits its frigid femme fatale, who may be an emotionally disturbed recovering drug addict or an innocent victim of smitten lawyer Alain Delon's Diabolique-ish manipulations. Though it has to be said, we know she's disturbed pretty much from the off because no sane woman would ever put up with Claude Brasseur's smartarse soap opera screenwriter, who is so relentlessly irritating that you'll want to hit him long before one of the cast does. An adaptation of Richard Matheson's Someone is Bleeding, one of those house of secrets/twist in the tail numbers, there aren't many surprises, unless you count how little screentime Delon actually has despite producing the film for his then-girlfriend Mireille Darc. Very much a B-movie with A-movie production values it's more vaguely tolerable than particularly enjoyable (not that the English dubbing helps), although the final scene is surprisingly well handled.",1284076800,,1091,5.169491525423729
8053392,3,B0007XG144,"I bought this release because I am a big Alain Delon fan and was surprised to have a found a gripping ,suspense thriller which resembles Jess Franco's 'VENUS IN FURS' but without the supernatural elements. It's also based on a novel by Richard Matheson called 'SOMEONE IS BLEEDING';  A struggling writer on sabbatical encounters a beautiful woman who appears coincidently as his character in his current novel and slowly becomes obsessed with her.  The woman slowly reveals a nightmarish web of subterfuge and murder and Delon plays an attorney also smitten with the woman and who may be a player from her past. The tension builds throughout its running time keeping the viewer guessing until its tragic climax. Razor blades and trench coats give it a Giallo feel but it never fully becomes one. A beautiful music score by Philippe Sarde  and great euro landscapes pepper the proceedings.  The quality is OK, English dubbed and full screen with some washed out color in some stretches but the films power is not diminished.  For fans of euro thrillers and for something different than the usual Hitchcock renditions which graced the screen predominantly in the late sixties.",1280102400,,1174,5.0
8053393,2,B0007XG144,"I have seen this movie in France when it first came out and was very thrilled to be able to get a DVD copy. However, even though it was advertized as being in French language, I was disappointed to receive a movie very poorly dubbed in English.

Would be thrilled if it is released in its original form and would buy it without second thought as it is one of the best suspense movies I ever seen.",1231632000,3,396,4.142857142857143
