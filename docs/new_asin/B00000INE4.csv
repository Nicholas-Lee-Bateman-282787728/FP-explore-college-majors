7910974,4,B00000INE4,"Despite its brevity, a measured mood is developed during this four minute multiple prizewinning short, perhaps due to a complete lack of dialogue that serves to enhance a surprise ending that delighted audiences at its Toronto Film Festival debut, as well as those who viewed it during its wide distribution to European and Asian theatres.  The title is cleverly reflective upon a theme of revenge that would be appropriate for a magazine published fantasy short short story, appreciated by the substantial numbers who saw the work in the Los Angeles area, playing there on the same bills as Tom Tykwer's RUN LOLA RUN.  The production for this short is flawlessly accomplished by all involved and especial notice shall be given here to the work of makeup artist Colin Shuler for a highly skillful prosthetic creation.",1136332800,,817,5.044444444444444
