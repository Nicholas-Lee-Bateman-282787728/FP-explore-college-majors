3007870,5,B000XU3XNS,Great opportunity to get a sense of Joseph's personality and overview of his life. Would recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about who Joseph was and what the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints believes in.,1370131200,7,232,4.9743589743589745

3007872,4,B000XU3XNS,This is a good film about Joseph smith. We attempted to have our 7 year old watch it as well but it did not good her attention. Sometimes the story jumped around to different periods in his life so I think that might be more difficult for a younger audience to follow.,1368835200,8,268,4.173076923076923

3007876,4,B000XU3XNS,"This DVD consists of a series of 14 short videos - each one stands by itself.  The typical duration between each video short is almost 60 seconds -  sufficiently long to make the time between segments annoying.  This DVD is Volume 1 of a future multi-volume set.  Each of the short movies depicts a dramatized portrayal of one of Joseph Smith's teachings, or experiences. The written words of various acquaintances of Joseph Smith are often used in the movies to describe the circumstances, the person's observations, or the person's feelings.  When those words are read as part of the movie, a subtitle is shown that says ""the voice of"" so and so.  I would have preferred the subtitles to read ""the words of"" so and so.  This collection of experiences and teachings is quite well done and very thought-provoking.  I would say that viewing this DVD is a much superior way to learn something of what Joseph Smith taught and experienced than to rely on the words of spurious third-hand antagonists.",1462665600,2,996,4.783625730994152
