8672182,1,B00MH26NTG,"I really can't recommend this workout.  I've tried both segments a few times and I wasn't challenged -- didn't even break a sweat.  There were also production issues.

First off, although this is called ""cardio blast,"" only one of the workouts has a cardio component.  The other is called ""hot core"" and is all core moves.  There were times during ""hot core"" that I was a little challenged, but I kept thinking the whole time I could do the abs DVD from P90X instead and be more challenged in half the amount of time.  The day I tried ""hot core"" as my main workout, I actually had to jog on my treadmill for a half hour afterwards, just to burn some calories.

The other set is step aerobics with some weightlifting segments.  For the most part, I didn't have any trouble following the routines.  So the choreography isn't bad.  But neither is it particularly challenging.  My introduction to step aerobics was a long (and tough, and high impact) Kathy Smith VHS tape from the late 90s or early 2000s.  So this was a little bit of a letdown, by comparison.  The strength moves are pretty standard.  Half the time, you're told to do whatever you want with your arms.  I found myself doing Kathy Smith arm moves.  Further, you're not given a lot of instruction about what weights to use.  5 pounds would probably be sufficient to start out, but you're going to want to increase that fairly early on.

I don't like the set.  It looks like it was filmed in a random gym somewhere.  Unfortunately, the cement floor is dirty (really) and the steps used in the demo look worn.  It's just not a polished look.  (I don't remember the music, so I guess that didn't irritate me much.)

The instructor is friendly but there's nothing remarkable about her.  She just seems like your average aerobics instructor in a local gym.  Fine for that level of instruction, but probably not quite ready to branch out into something that's going to get distributed across the country.  She talks like the workout is super challenging, but I honestly don't think you could get her body (or the bodies of the demonstrators) if this was the only type of workout you did.

Probably my biggest gripe, other than the lack of difficulty, is the editing.  This looks like someone tried every single special effect from an intro-level video effects package.  So there's glowing text on screen, there are unrelated graphics in the background that take up 1/3 of the screen (which means the actual demo video is quite small, especially if you have a small TV), etc.  But the biggest problem is that sometimes there are two camera angles of the exercisers on the screen at the same time.  And the moves they are doing don't match up.  Like one is a couple of seconds ahead of the other, and ahead of the spoken cues.  So you're watching and you actually can't tell what you're supposed to be doing.

In the end, there are better cardio workouts available and also plenty of other options for core workouts.  Some of the step workouts from the late 90s/early 2000s (Kathy Smith and others) have been released on DVD and those are actually quite challenging (though some of the clothing and hairstyles are a bit dated).  Not recommended.",1421712000,4,3199,4.609929078014185

8672184,1,B00MH26NTG,"This video was not..I repeat not...a cardio blast, nor an ""invigorating"" workout. I was hopeful since a stepper, and hand weights are  used, but the moves were very basic and I did not work up a sweat at all. I was disappointed and would only recommend it for a first time exerciser. The production quality was also pretty poor,the filming is not clear and appears grainy.
 Shape Magazines 400 Calorie Fat Blast by Summer Sanders is a far better cardio-weight workout.",1416182400,3,468,4.765432098765432
8672185,1,B00MH26NTG,"Very disappointing. Not a blast at all. Maybe if your a beginner it can be introduction to working out. However being an advanced personal trainer I didn't work up a sweat or raise my heart rate at all. That being said I wouldn't bother, there are much better beginner dvds out there.",1416096000,3,284,4.480769230769231
