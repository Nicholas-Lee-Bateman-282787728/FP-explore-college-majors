8507107,4,B006ZM7JWE,"Again this week a nice movie with some good performances. Chirag Paswan has done well in his debut movie. But what is so good in this movie is that after a long time we see Poonam Dhillon and Kabir Bedi at their respective best. Poonam Dhillon looks beautiful and has great screen presence,Kabir Bedi after a string of old haggard roles is a macho man type here with powerful booming voice and overpowering personality. Camera work is absolutely lovely and innovative here compared to recent movies which give no importance to it. Camera captures the great beauty of hill-side Vineyard as well as the sun setting beyond the Ocean. Songs are not great but OK type. Dalip Tahil again impresses after his RA-One role here he is as a Sardar. Its a easy to watch movie where Chirag is a tennis player with estranged Parents. Kangana seems very ordinary here though people did find her funny and amusing reminds me of Marilyn Monroe.",1327968000,,927,4.693251533742331
