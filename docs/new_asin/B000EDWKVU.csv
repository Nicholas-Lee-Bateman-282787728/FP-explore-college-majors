8108512,4,B000EDWKVU,"I bought this DVD and also the vol. 3 after finding vol. 1 at a flea market; this is a very odd series of episodes featuring a family of mannequins. Oh yes, mannequins. Of course, the mouths don't move when they speak and their movoment is basically a cutaway shot from one spot to another. The whole concept is hilarious, if you're into off-beat humor, then this series is for you.",1380758400,,382,4.394366197183099
8108513,4,B000EDWKVU,"The twinsa re annoying, so skip the first two episodes on this disc. But let the craziness begin with ""Mikey Gets Dumped"" !  Mikey's parents come up with an off the wall idea to get Mikey's girlfriend back.....

Alot of the jokes here have to be read-between-the lines.

Mikey's tutor is a tramp
Mikey's dad is a closet homosexual who constantly insult's Mikey's mom and prances in his Japanese underwear with a buddy
Mikey's cousin Laura is a self serving witch and manipulator
Laura's brother is a stud/ pimp
Mikey's mom is a tramp who does young men in cardboard boxes in the city park.",1253059200,,589,4.59047619047619
8108514,5,B000EDWKVU,"I was introduced to The Fuccons by a friend of mine who is really into Japanese culture and what not. I thought it was freakin' funny as hell! It's so different from anything else that's on TV here in the United States. And their blatant (though just a bit off) mimicry of a 50's/60's era ""Leave it to Beaver"" type of family values and the situations they finsd themselves in is just a rioty into itself!",1211068800,,404,4.328947368421052
