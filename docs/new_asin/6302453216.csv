7826029,5,6302453216,"This movie is pleasant on a very light and simple level.  It features very beautiful scenery since it was filmed in Hawaii, although, it is supposed to be Tahiti.  It is based on a book and the movie features Esther Williams as a lovely local who dreams of leaving Tahiti to go to the United States, much to the consternation of those who love her.  Her plans take a change, however, when a dynamic schoolteacher from Springfield, Ohio arrives to live on a plantation he has just inherited.  It turns out his property isn't as glamorous as he was led to believe, however, he soon succumbs to the beauty that is Tahiti.  Some of his American individualistic ways cause a rift between him and Esther, but in beautiful musical and colorful fashion, all is resolved before the end of the film.  It is a movie that is suitable for family viewing and it makes for a good relaxing film.",1411257600,,879,4.49685534591195
7826030,5,6302453216,"I really liked this movie. It was filmed on the Island of Kauai.
So I went to Kauai to see the place where this movie was filmed.
The movie location is absolute a wonderful setting for the movie.",1384473600,,195,4.157894736842105
7826031,5,6302453216,"I have looked for this movie for a long time as to me it was one of he best movies I ever saw as a young teenager.  Was visiting a friend in Palm Beach FL & the theater we saw it was decorated with undersea murals on the walls with beautiful velvet drapes covering the screen which went along with the theme of the movie.  It was a precious love story with Ester Williams, my favorite movie star, & wonderful music featuring Howard Keel.",1380672000,,437,4.190476190476191
7826032,5,6302453216,"I bought this video for my mother and enjoyed it very much myself.  The music is enchanting, and seeing Howard Keel and Esther Williams together was great.  There's a bit of everything in this film--drama, comedy, music, beautiful scenery, and more!  This is a must DVD for Keel and/or Williams' fans!",1316131200,,301,4.862745098039215
7826033,3,6302453216,"Esther Williams stars in this silly South Pacific love story, filmed largely on the Hawaiian island of Kauai (although the story is supposed to be set in Tahiti...)  Her love interest is the schmaltzy show tune crooner Howard Keel, playing a lazy American who inherits an abandoned coconut farm, and after making it out to the island picks up a yen for the half-Tahitian hottie played by Williams.  She tames him, he mellows out, learns to like small children and to kick back into Tahitian time, just like the locals.  Musically, the Harry Warren compositions are not, admittedly, among his best work, although there is a dazzling Tahitian dance number, staged in a Busby Berkeley-like fashion, and if you know Kauai at all, the improbable cutaways from one beach to the next are pretty hilarious.  Not the greatest musicial ever (and Williams hardly gets in the water at all!) but it has it's charms.  Take the ""happy native"" stuff with a grain of salt, though.",1036108800,9,963,4.8121212121212125
7826034,4,6302453216,"This is one of my favorite Esther Williams films.  It's very well done, witha lovely sitting on a tropical island.  There are also some delightful tunes in it as well.",1029024000,5,167,4.533333333333333
7826035,2,6302453216,"There is nothing taxing or demanding about Pagan Love song and people wanting escapist fare may be pleased with it. Lush island scenery and a hummable score are the film's strongest assets. It is a long way, however,  from producer Arthur Freed's finest achievements. 2 1/2 stars.",963792000,5,280,4.957446808510638
