4194857,4,B003UBLKTG,"Fresh off her Oscar-winning role in 1935 for DANGEROUS, Bette Davis was entitled to believe that only the best of roles would henceforth come her way. Instead, in 1936, Warner Bros. plonked her in the lightweight screwball comedy GOLDEN ARROW. Trooper that she was - or not; she did routinely rail against the more craptacular scripts sent her way - Bette Davis was predictably the best thing about the film.

I love watching movie stars in their early pictures. Take Lucille Ball. This may be heresy, but I've always preferred Lucille Ball when she was trying to get a foot in the door back in the late '30s and '40s, years before she would land I LOVE LUCY. And while I respect the hell out of Bette Davis The Dramatic Actress, I always had more fun with her rare comedies. With her forthrightness and caustic delivery and her inability to take guff, she lent an exhilarating edginess to her comedies. Admittedly, GOLDEN ARROW falls in the rear when thrown in with her other lighthearted ventures of the 1930s (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fashions-of-1934-1934/dp/B005UZNC8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fashions of 1934 (1934)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Love-I-m-After/dp/B002KE4ZIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Love I'm After</a>, and, yes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jimmy-The-Gent-Remaster/dp/B0046CM8VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jimmy The Gent  (Remaster)</a>). But because Bette Davis is THAT good and THAT dynamic, GOLDEN ARROW cannot be dismissed so offhandedly. It holds moments of sheer watchability. And for those who know their character actors from Hollywood's Golden Age, Eugene Pallette and E. E. Clive have bit parts.

GOLDEN ARROW takes place in a long-vanished era in which reporters were regarded as chivalrous citizens. Factoring that, it's not so far a stretch that a wealthy heiress, Daisy Appleby (Davis) - fed up with being pursued by languid, fortune-hunting European lords - would coax strapping young $30-a-week beat reporter, Johnny Jones (George Brent), into a marriage of convenience. She tries to convince him: They both benefit from this fake (and temporary) union. She gets to be left alone by the newshounds. He finds leisure to write his great American novel. After witnessing Daisy's plight first hand, Johnny reluctantly agrees to a six-month marriage. Most of what follows, you can probably suss out.

It's one of eleven films that paired up Davis and Brent, and, yes, there's a spark there. But George Brent doesn't have to stretch his acting muscles much, playing a stand-up reporter. For most of the film, his character, Johnny, adopts a bemused (and then increasingly vexed) expression, especially when the opportunistic executives of Daisy's cosmetic empire eagerly promote his ""just one of the guys"" persona thru a relentless media campaign. Johnny Jones pretty rapidly gets sick of living the lie. As it turns out, he's not the only one.

GOLDEN ARROW is regarded as a slight entertainer, and not just because it runs at a mere 68 minutes. And yet Bette Davis grabs your attention. She exudes that sense of verisimilitude. Even when she plays a daffy heiress, there's conviction there, a weight to it. Ultimately, there's nothing new or refreshing about GOLDEN ARROW. It more or less follows a familiar plot. But there's Bette Davis. And there's that one startling plot twist halfway thru. And there's the amusing third act, in which more people than you'd think end up with wicked matching shiners. To quote a contentious Johnny Jones: ""Where's your black eye?"" 3.5 out of 5 stars for GOLDEN ARROW.",1332288000,9,3690,5.59391771019678
4194858,3,B003UBLKTG,"""The Golden Arrow"" is a rare entry in the legacy of the great Bette Davis - a lightweight romantic comedy.  Davis, herself, panned the film as trivial, coming as it did not long after her first Oscar, but it is not bad at all.  She stars as a bogus heiress, employed by a cosmetics manafacturer, to help promote their cold cream. To ward off European suitors, she marries a reporter and the film bobs along merrily to its inevitable outcome. The good news is that George Brent plays the reporter and he and Davis always paired well. Brent has a slightly whimsical approach to comedy which works so well. While the film maybe lightweight, Davis gets star treatment with many attractive closeups and fashions. Her acting is not frenetic at all and her diction is much more natural than usual. She is charming.

The DVD has been issued within the Warner's Archive Collection (on demand) which means it is expensive, there are no extras and the print is unrestored.  In this case, the print is adequate.",1312243200,14,999,4.659090909090909
4194859,5,B003UBLKTG,"This is a cute little screwball comedy and frankly, if you get George Brent and Bette Davis in a film, you can't go wrong.  Davis is the heir to a fortune, Brent is the reporter that agrees to marry her to keep the male gold diggers away.  He agrees so he can write the novel he has always wanted. He is noble and of course, can't help falling in love with her along the way. There is a neat twist at the end and I won't spoil it for you.  I bought it never having seen it, and I know it will be one I will watch over and over.  I already own Jezebel, The Great Lie, Dark Victory and In This our Life. I can't wait until Warners releases more of the films they made together.  There were eleven in all, and I plan to check the Archives often.",1282521600,27,742,3.92

8405797,2,B003UBLKTG,"The Golden Arrow is one of Davis"" worst films period.  One can see why Davis was angry and concerned about where her career  was leading.  The film is, for the most part, unwatchable.  The plot is inane and acting ridiculously, but unintentiosly, funny. The only reason to watch this disaster is to see Davis and a youngish George Brent cavorting on a yacht in their dated bathing suits' especially on HD TV!",1392336000,2,408,4.625
8405798,3,B003UBLKTG,"Main reason to see this one is if you like either Brent or Davis and want to see them in early roles.  The plot is good and I don't want to give away too much, the biggest complaint is the copy.  The sound is not great on this print but the video quality is pretty good.  It is fairly short (about 70 mins) and keeps a decent pace, but their are only a few genuine laughs and they may be offset by the scary swimsuit worn by George Brent in the film, YIKES!!!  Depression era swimwear was not good.",1388448000,3,498,4.0
