5079771,5,B007ET1644,This story line is a bit complicated and not clearly understood.  I thoroughly enjoyed seing the young actor with down syndrome in it because my son has down syndrome.  He was great but the plot was far too complicate and I am still not sure I get it.  I will watch this movie over and over just to enjoy the little actor.  He was fabulous.,1356393600,,340,4.184615384615385
5079772,5,B007ET1644,"Cafe De Flore is quite the artistic tour-de-force in that virtually all of the essential creative elements of writing, acting, directing, cinematography, and the finest details of technical production have come together quite beautifully to produce both an exceptional emotional experience for the viewer, and a very satisfying sensory one as well.

But more than just an artistic achievement, this film has also perhaps presented us with a significant cultural and philosophical achievement as well in that it has managed to inject a somewhat new and unconventional idea(and to some, an even controversial idea) into what we would generally consider to be a fairly conventional movie storyline of love, loss, and familial discord. This idea is obviously not one that was added simply to make the two rather complex and inter-twining stories of the film even more interesting or more complex than it already is, but was clearly designed from the start to be the ""driving force"" and main theme (or ""message"", if you will) of the movie itself. I will not completely give away what that ""message"" is here, but I will offer a clue by saying that it is a message that may be able to give a great many of us who are not particularly religious by nature a pretty good reason to believe that there will always be a hope, even beyond this life, for personal redemption and reconciliation.

I recommend this film especially to anyone, like me, who understands that a good film can be much, much more than merely entertaining.  Cafe De Flore, I believe, will succeed in that regard far beyond your wildest expectations.

5079773,4,B007ET1644,"""Cafe de Flore"" (120 min.) is a Canadian movie which was released in 2011. The movie takes a while to figure as there are two seemingly unrelated stories taking place, and on top of that those stories are not brought in a straight linear line. The first story is set in today's Montreal and features Antoine (played by Kevin Parent), a father of two girls who has just left his wife for another woman for what appears to be love at first sight (""coup de foudre""). The second story is set in Paris in the late 60s and features Jacqueline (played by Vanessa Paradis), the mother of a young boy with Down syndrom.

It would be doing you a disservice by telling you much more from the plot. In fact, it isn't revealed until the last few moments of the movie how these 2 seemingly separate stories intertwine. But, as is often the case, it isn't so much about the destination that it is about the journey. On that level, the movie absolutely delivers. Because the way the movie is edited and shot, you feel at times as if you are in a parallel and abstract universe of love and betrayal.

This movie was nominated for 12 Genies (Canada's Oscar equivalent) a few months ago, and Vanessa Paradis won for Best Actress, and deservedly so. It's hard to believe that she is approaching 40 now (evn though she still looks like she's 25 or so), she's been around forever with both her music and her acting. She brings a passionate performance here. Kudos also to Marin Gerrier and Alice Dubois who play the 2 young children with Down syndrom. This movie is miles away from your typical Hollywood main fare. If you are interested in a top quality foreign movie, ""Cafe de Flore"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1335052800,15,1686,4.506535947712418

8515444,2,B007ET1644,"When I first viewed this movie it was on Netflix and I loved it.however, the copy I ordered had different edits. I'd like to own a copy of the one i viewed that had the music from Sven-G-Englar.  Perhaps one was the European version and one was American.?  There were many scenes that differed.  If anyone can speak to this I'd be grateful.",1469750400,,340,4.365079365079365

8515447,4,B007ET1644,"An unusual Movie. It starts off at a slow pace and though it continues that way,I became more engaged as the plot developed. Its quite sad and those who like to shed a tear or two who will need their box of kleenex!
A very 'un-hollywood' movie and all the better for it. A Movie for Adults though not an Adult Movie if you know what I mean!",1412294400,,340,4.014705882352941

8515450,4,B007ET1644,"I would like to rate this a 5 star but due to the fact that it skipped about a little too much it had to lose a star from me.  This is an excellent art film with super performances from all the actors, especially the down's syndrome children!  One must be able to acknowledge that there may be reincarnation to truly enjoy this film.  This is a lovely film about love and the responsibility which that bond encompasses.  Sad and joyous at the same time.",1401062400,,453,4.294117647058823
8515451,1,B007ET1644,"If I could, I would rate this DVD as 1 Zero because of its complete lack of one clear line in the English translation.  I cannot believe that this superb film is being sold in the above condition in the U.S.  I eventually returned this DVD to you and I ordered the PAL edition from the U.K. which is superb in its quality of translation.  What a difference!  My advice is to order this wonderful film from Amazon, U.K.",1394064000,3,418,4.253164556962025
8515452,5,B007ET1644,"Directed & written by Jean-Marc Vallee of ""Dallas Buyer's Club,"" with great performances by Vanessa Paradis & Marin Gerrier as her son, who has Down's Syndrome. Some of the most beautiful and daring scenes ever shot of mother and child.
 A story-within-a-story that explores the ultimate questions of:  Who needs our love the most? How does one survive when true love finds another, truer soulmate? How do we love again?",1393977600,,420,4.985714285714286
