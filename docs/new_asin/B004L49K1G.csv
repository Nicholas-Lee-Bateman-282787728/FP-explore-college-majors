8433784,5,B004L49K1G,I am an Alaskan native from the Aleutian islands and I have purchased many of these DVDs (World War II and Cradle of Storms) for family members who have never been to our  native land.  I love these DVDs. They used to be on one DVD but now they have made it into two DVDs.,1395878400,,272,3.9272727272727272
