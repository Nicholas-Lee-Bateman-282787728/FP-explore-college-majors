8482980,4,B005QAGC0Q,"This is an obscure 1935 no-budget gem. Buck Coburn aka Rocky Cameron was really stunt man and horse trainer Gene Alsace who got the lead in this forgotten oater when low class star Montie Montana was unable to sign on. The story is nothing special, the old sheep vs cattle range war, and even for a low budget effort this has got to be one of the lowest yet.
However, this movie has more cowboy lingo and slang packed into it's 55 minute running time than any 10 other B-Westerns lassoed together. The good guys and bad guys exchange barbed colloquialisms at and with each other. Lots of this stuff is sharp and quite funny, especially lines coming from Bud Osborne (bad guy) and Ben Corbett (good guy) before, during and after gunplay, or just plain ribbing each other. Some of this dialogue appears downright mean spirited, except for being delivered with a sly grin. I find it all to be pretty refreshing stuff.
No big sets here. Everything is shot on the cuff, giving the proceedings a realistic look and feel. And whatever town set they used, I must say that I've never seen so much horsecrap on the streets!!! Talk about realistic. I can image the flies and smell. And townspeople just sit there on the steps and walkways taking it all in. You won't see that on the GUNSMOKE tv series. As for the look of the film itself, there's even some modest camera movement, tracking in and out of several shots when a static set-up is what we're most used to. Not that this is some lost art film, it's still a pretty poor production, but I found it to be an interesting one as well.
Coburn/Cameron/Alsace, though not the best cowboy hero to ride the poverty row range, wasn't too bad in the lead role, actually quite acceptable. The real stars are the bit parts played by Osborne, Corbett, Lafe McKee and several others. Yeah, they may muff a scene or two (one take only seemed the rule), but they all created memorable, well rounded characters out of their little screen time and limited lines.
The ALPHA dvd is rather nice, a clear picture with good sound, better than usual.",1335139200,,2073,4.530666666666667
