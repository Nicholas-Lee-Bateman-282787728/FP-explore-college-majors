1393289,3,B000054OVF,"This movie was taken from a story by James Curwood entitled ""Wheels of Fate"", and for me that title fits much better than ""Dawn on the Great Divide"". The years 1941 and 1942 saw several of the Rough Riders films made and though this movie is good, it doesn't have the jump that many of the others have. This was the last film for Buck Jones, and it is not his best performance, as he looks somewhat tired and it affected his performance.

His leading lady, co star actually, was a gal born in England, trained in Australia, named Mona Barrie. Before dying in 1964 she racked up quite a few movies, as well as stage performances, and she truly turns in a very memorable performance in this film. For me, she saves this movie.

The cast of stock characters is good with the usual suspects on board, especially Roy Barcroft, and Raymond Hatton, did they ever make a western without Roy Barcroft. And an extra treat is a very young Tris Coffin who plays Mona's husband but ends up dead part way through the movie. And yes, the wagon train is interesting by not the best ever for me, it is too small using undersized wagons other than the railroad supply wagons which resemble more the 20 mule team Borax type wagons.

This is a very good, solid movie from 1942, offering 69 minutes of black and white entertainment, but only a three star-plus one in my estimation. I enjoy all the Rough Rider films and it seems a little strange not having Tim McCoy and Buck Jones and Raymond Hatton together as a team. Rex Bell played the character Jack Carson well enough, but the regular trio one expects just isn't there.

Anyway, if you are looking for a good, ole fashioned western, the way they used to make 'em, then take a look at this one. You will find something to enjoy with this one.

  as a foot note mr.jones was more than a movie hero,he died in the coconut grove club fire in 1942,having gotten to the door mr.jones went back and began to pull people out,on his third trip back in he never came back out.sometimes movies can't do justice to what a real hero does. buck jones -a hero in everyway a man can be.",1147046400,,669,4.251968503937008

1393292,5,B000054OVF,"I haven't seen this copy, so I don't know if they will publish this review, but I already have the movie. The almost-ten-minute wagon train scene near the beginning is priceless. It's constantly, slowly moving and done so well you really get the feel for what such a trip must have been like. A variety of people from that era are characterized rather well for a B western. There is tragedy at the beginning which leads to Mona Barry doing a rendition of ""Rock of Ages"" acapella which, along with her short commentary about herself after, will break your heart. I've never heard anything like it. Tears flow every time I watch it. Great stuff Mona, wherever you are.

Again Buck gets to hold a baby and call him ""little shaver"". I love that. Buck does a solid job as always. This was his last movie before dying in the Cocoanut Grove fire in '42. The story line is good and there is the occasional nifty quote - ""I've got to hand it to you Easterners, you sure are slick with the brain-power"" is my favorite.

This version probably follows Alpha's usual quality standards. Hey, at least they are putting them out there, so I give them full credit for that. Many of these movies would never be seen by a large number of us if it wasn't for them. Hey, Alpha, why don't you start a Digitally Remastered division and make this your first one. The audio and video of this 70 minute B Western epic simply cry out for digital enhancement.

Whatever the quality, for Buck and especially for the wagon train scene and Mona Barry's ""Rock of Ages"", I'm giving it 5 stars.

1393320,4,B000054OVF,"Dawn on the Great Divide, 1943 film

The opening scene shows tall trees and a lake. Indians sit in a circle and communicate in sign language. White men are responsible says one Indian, they came from the Beaver Lake region. A wagon train is taking supplies to the railroad being built. The wagons are drawn by horses [not oxen as in olden times]. A conversation tells about some people. Sandy Hopkins found a site for camping that night. Buck Roberts arranged for a womans passage. [Note the difference in wagons.] The owner of a Trading Post knows a railroad will kill off his business. A visitor overhears a conversation; he wants a new outfit. Carson is told to move on. One woman complains about the gambler and his woman. A woman died after giving birth; others gossip about her. There is a song. A marriage certificate has information.

A man rides in with news about past raids on settlers. Buck Roberts orders changes in travel. A gang of about thirty Indians chases after them, shooting pistols. But there is one survivor! The railroad supply wagon train goes on. They approach a mountain pass. The railroad wagons will be separated. The other wagons will camp outside of town. One man makes a deal with the gang, he knows something. There is a song for entertainment. There is a plan for a later double-cross. Buck Roberts tells the men they will leave at 8 AM tomorrow. Sandy tells the men about a plan. The gambling goes on all night. The losers get free drinks. When the gang attacks they find a surprise! These villains will fill up the new jail. Sadie warns Buck about Loder. There is a meeting in the street. The next morning the wagon train leaves for the railroad site. Buck says goodbye to Sadie.

This story is more complex than other Westerns. It was adapted from James Oliver Curwoods story Wheels of Fate. Rex Bell was later elected Governor of Nevada. Could another actor later do well in politics? The postwar Interstate Highway System would also change travel and affect small businesses built along the older state highways (which ran from city to city). In November 1942 Buck Jones and others attended a football game in Boston. Afterwards they went to the Cocoanut Grove' tavern. A fire broke out and killed many. Beware of any dining facility that has only one entrance or exit. The toxins in smoke asphyxiate before people are burned.",1404604800,,2365,4.693975903614458
