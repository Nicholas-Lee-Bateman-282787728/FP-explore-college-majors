5578329,4,B00BCMSXOK,"In the quaint town of Fairland, somewhere in California, Beth Landon (Julie Mond) has gone out on a limb. An aspiring singer once, and a high school English teacher today and director of her school's glee club, Beth has lobbied for country singer Jason Keith (Trevor Donovan) to perform at her town's annual Strawberry Festival. Beth's already been selected as this year's Strawberry Queen and so has to appear in several festival events. Mr. Keith, besides performing, is also tapped as the Grand Marshal. It's setting out to be a fine Strawberry Festival.

Except that Jason Keith turns out to be a first class tool, unfailingly inconsiderate. He's rude and dismissive and tardy. Beth, who's a big fan and tends to sing along to the guy's crossover hit ""Easy Heart,"" is chagrined. But she's got spunk. She's a real spitfire. From jump she doesn't hesitate to call him out on his difficult behavior. And because this is a Hallmark joint and the network prefers to keep things conventional (and I probably mean that in a good way), you can predict what happens from that point on. There's comfort in familiarity, I know. I flip over to Hallmark when I'm in the mood for a sappy romance. Julie Mond and Trevor Donovan are actors I'd never heard of, but I enjoyed watching them work their roles. They generate a spark together.

Donovan is the bigger surprise in that he's able to make you like him despite his unmannerly bad boy character. I guess it helps that his boorish exterior and ""too cool for school"" demeanor mask a heap of insecurities. Nashville heartthrob Jason Keith, it turns out, is a country singer purely by accident. Thru the course of the festival, Beth and Jason squabble and quibble and finally call a truce. There's fun in watching Jason undergo an attitude adjustment and morph from jerk to caring guy. When we finally get to the end and Jason sings on stage, we feel pretty good about him. And if that's truly Trevor Donovan singing, then all sorts of props to him because his singing voice is striking.

Beth's character arc isn't as sweeping. She was already at a good place when the film began. She's our point-of-view character, and she's best when playing foil to Jason Keith. And who knows? Maybe being around the guy long enough will rekindle her ambition for a singing career. Just maybe. Nothing much more to say about STRAWBERRY SUMMER. It aired in 2012. Shelley Long has a nice supporting bit as Beth's mom. There are some funny moments, mostly involving the cocky country superstar getting taken down a peg once or three times. It's silly, but the strawberry judging contest - in which the contestants had to incorporate strawberry into their various dishes - had me grinning pretty good. This sequence is probably what made me start thinking better of Jason Keith. If you're cruising channels and you end up on the Hallmark Channel and STRAWBERRY SUMMER is on, consider sticking around. You may pick up some fascinating recipes for strawberries.",1373760000,9,2981,4.7957198443579765
5578330,3,B00BCMSXOK,"Some of the costumes and contests at the Strawberry Festival are kind of goofy, but generally this movie is worth watching.  The whole family can enjoy it.",1373500800,2,155,4.7407407407407405
5578331,5,B00BCMSXOK,A very cute movie to watch. I like the actors in this movie and that's the reason I purchased it.,1373414400,2,97,3.9
5578332,5,B00BCMSXOK,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Strawberry Summer was really, really clean. There was no sex, violence, drugs, or nudity. There are a couple of drinking scenes in a bar featuring beer and wine; low cut shirts on women, and a character is rude to people but he changes.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.

This is an great family movie that focuses on following your heart and your own dreams, instead of what others want you to do.  Beth, a high school glee club teacher, manages to get big country singer/star Jason Keith to appear at the Fairland Strawberry Festival.  Beth always stands up to Jason, something he isn't used to. They soon become friends and she also learns why he has cancelled performances in the past and has a reputation for having a temper.  As Jason spends more time with Beth, his attitude starts to fade, he opens up to her and they each encourage the other to follow their dreams.

Overall, I loved this movie and will watch it again.",1372636800,3,1235,4.418502202643172

5578337,3,B00BCMSXOK,"A Hallmark romantic comedy with some tried and true TV star favorites.

This Gaiam release gives us Julie Mond starring as a music teacher promoting the local strawberry festival by bringing in a famous country singer, played by handsome Trevor Donovan, whose star is not so polished as it should be.  There's romantic conflict brewing between the leads and lots of folksy humor and characters.

The real stars of the movie are all the TV personalities of past: Shelley Long(Cheers) playing the mom; Dick Van Dyke's son and co-star, the rugged looking, Barry Van Dyke; Cindy Williams(Laverne and Shirley, can you believe it?).

It's all easy going fun and mild comedy.  We know where this is going.  The editing is somewhat choppy; there are inconsistencies and holes in the story; the music, with the singing near the end, a touch corny, and the whole thing, in general, a bit weak, but... the leads are cute together, and it's harmless and means well.  Hallmark clean, but the kids found it boring.",1368057600,28,1000,4.847058823529411

Beth, reigning as Strawberry Queen, attempts to stick up for her favorite singer, until she finally meets Jason face-to-face and it's obvious it won't be easy. But behind Jason's rock star image, he's hiding a secret about his past that could turn around his tanking career.

Beth (Julie Mond) is that sweet wholesome gal that is very plucky too and doesn't mince words. Jason (Trevor Donovan) is the bad boy of country music who has a very serious attitude problem. When these 2 meet to get the local strawberry festival off the ground we get sparks and we get attraction? Jason has a secret though and Beth tries her level best to humanize him and we see changes and we see more, too. I thought this was a very sweet movie and will recommend it to one and all.",1489190400,2,614,4.394736842105263
