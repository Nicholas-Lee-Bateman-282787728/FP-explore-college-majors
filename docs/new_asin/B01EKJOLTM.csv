7738062,5,B01EKJOLTM,Too short but excellent view on autism going beyond the Narration of Temple Grandin and featuring more than young children. Worth 30 minutes of your day if you are interested in a fresh perspective on autism.,1464134400,,208,4.805555555555555
7738063,5,B01EKJOLTM,"I have twin cousins in their early twenties that are both autistic. I have only heard of the social issues of autism and never of the perception ""issues"". It was very enlightening and I feel I understand my cousins a lot better now. It gave me a lot of food for thought. I am a Psychology major and would love to work on the autism mysteries in a professional setting in the future. It was an extremely well put together piece. I hope anyone reading will/has give/n this short documentary a shot :)",1464048000,3,498,4.365591397849462

7738065,5,B01EKJOLTM,"This is such an enlightening and amazing account of the autistic experience.  It is beautifully to behold each story as it unfolds--our greatest teachers about what it's like to be autistic is actual autistics ! Bravo to all those involved, it should be mandatory watching for every one who wants to understand the ""Spectrum""!",1463443200,,326,5.037037037037037
7738066,5,B01EKJOLTM,"Beautiful, inspiring, soul baring accounts from adults with Autism, giving voice to their sensory intake experiences! I only wish it was a longer documentary!",1463356800,6,158,5.625
7738067,5,B01EKJOLTM,"Great work was really interesting to hear about the different sensory perceptions. That martial artist looked a genius. In slow motion his movement remained entirely graceful, without any doubt.",1503273600,,194,5.724137931034483
7738068,5,B01EKJOLTM,Sooooooo helpful in explaining what autism is and is not.,1502150400,,57,4.8
7738069,5,B01EKJOLTM,"I have a child with Fragile x/ autism and another with adhd, and a 3rd with mild special need. Like he physiological challenges and blessings, these needs are both stressful, shocking and simultaneously brilliant and beautiful.",1501372800,,227,5.333333333333333
7738070,5,B01EKJOLTM,Amazing work of insight!,1499904000,,24,5.25
7738071,5,B01EKJOLTM,"I hope Temple makes more movies. She knows how to explain things in a way neurotypical people understand. This movie is beautiful, interesting, and compelling. Everyone should watch it but those who love someone on the spectrum will likely find it especially powerful. I do wish it were longer or that it were a series that kept going indefinitely.",1498262400,,348,4.915254237288136
7738072,5,B01EKJOLTM,Simply beautiful.  Full of compassion and understanding.,1497312000,,56,7.0
7738073,5,B01EKJOLTM,"This is a quick watch, but so very insightful. It was amazing to hear directly from people on the spectrum about what their experiences are like. I wish my son was able to articulate his experiences to me so I could understand him better and help him better. Thank you for this film.",1494201600,,283,4.3584905660377355
7738074,5,B01EKJOLTM,This was so beautiful. I have so much to learn.,1493596800,,47,3.8
7738075,5,B01EKJOLTM,This is the best 20 minutes you can spend if you want to understand perceptions outside of our daily realm.  Jill Jones has captured the perspectives of how an autistic mind absorbs the world on all levels.  A true gem and marvelous teaching experience.,1491609600,,253,4.7272727272727275
7738076,5,B01EKJOLTM,This film was beautifully produced and directed. I enjoyed every minute. I was amazed to see how Gene Hurwin used his gift as an occupational therapist to help children with autism get the sensory inputs they need to navigate.,1491004800,,226,4.82051282051282
7738077,5,B01EKJOLTM,Fantastic short film with great visuals.,1490054400,,40,5.833333333333333
7738078,4,B01EKJOLTM,"Temple Grandin is right: understanding sensory issues is key to understanding the experience of those of us on the autistic spectrum.  Our social skills difficulties are often caused by our discomfort in the environment in which we find ourselves, awash in stimuli that we cannot process, control or understand.  This film is beautifully done and I greatly enjoyed watching it.  But it is just the beginning of exploration of this topic.  I want to see more research done into this area and in particular more discussion of how autistic ADULTS can help themselves cope with the sensory problems that are, as Temple says, not only minor nuisances but also life-limiting.",1489104000,3,669,5.054545454545455
7738079,5,B01EKJOLTM,Beautiful documentary. I have two daughters with ASD and SPD. To be able to hear about sensory issues from people with ASD versus people who study ASD is tremendously helpful in working with my children.,1486771200,,203,4.828571428571428
7738080,5,B01EKJOLTM,"I am a Certified Developmental Disabilities Nurse.  Over the years that title has become troubling to me especially when we speak of sensory perception issues outside the realm of societal norms.  This documentary helps validate the humanity within our perceived differences.  For many on the ASD living life outside of a caretaking situation is possible.  For others like Tito, where speech is difficult, adaptive devices are necessary.  It comes down to what effort are we as a community willing to invest and when will we stop using ""disabled"" as a determination of worth?  For those interested another film on Amazon is Neurotypical that shows more success stories of people living ""under the spectrum"".",1485993600,3,707,5.212389380530974
7738081,3,B01EKJOLTM,Interesting but I only watched a little.,1485820800,,40,4.857142857142857
7738082,5,B01EKJOLTM,Beautifully graphic.  Enlightening.  More info into how these unique minds perceive in an interesting way.,1485388800,,106,6.0
7738083,5,B01EKJOLTM,Excellent and informative short film! Explains how the mind is wired uniquely in individuals on the spectrum.,1485129600,,109,5.470588235294118
7738084,5,B01EKJOLTM,Informative.,1484697600,,12,12.0
7738085,5,B01EKJOLTM,"Many films that help to explain autism seem to focus only on individuals who ""overcame"" their autism and are now highly successful public speakers.

But what about the nonverbal kids? What happens if they never gain normal verbal conversation skills by the time they reach adulthood?

What about the kids who are more comfortable painting or playing music alone in their room? How is their quality of life?

Thank you for making a realistic film based on the experiences of 4 unique individuals with autism! It helped me understand my 6 year old a bit more, and it gave me hope that even if his verbal speech is limited, his language skills could still really take off once he learns how to write.",1484352000,,697,4.650406504065041
7738086,5,B01EKJOLTM,"This documentary was very well done. Very informative into the word of sensory for an autistic person. Made me stop and really reflect on how each of us views the world differently, regardless if we're autistic or not. Beautifully done and was drawn in by the amazing music performed by the Macedonian Radio Symphonic Orchestra. I do wish a little more was provided on other sensory perceptions and maybe some techniques used to assist those with sensory overload, but loved the stories of each individual. They're inspiring for overcoming the bombardment of information and sensory perception on a daily basis.",1483660800,4,611,5.12
7738087,5,B01EKJOLTM,Fantastic!,1482710400,,10,10.0
7738088,5,B01EKJOLTM,"Very interesting, my son has sensory problems and it has been hard for me to understand how he sees the world. I find any glimpse in to that world to be helpful in my helping him.",1480636800,,179,4.0
7738089,4,B01EKJOLTM,"If you are looking for a ""movie"" experience this film is not for you. On the other hand if you are looking to have an increased understanding of sensory processing and autism, and would like to catch a glimpse of what someone who has these conditions may experience, then it's a very nice educational piece.",1479945600,,307,4.6
7738090,4,B01EKJOLTM,"I have a new appreciation about what people with ASD experience. Listening to the explanations of sensory overload was heartbreaking.  I had no idea of the struggle living with ASD was.  It's not that how they perceive the world that is wrong, it's about how they perceive the world that is different.",1479081600,,301,4.769230769230769
7738091,5,B01EKJOLTM,I myself have autism.  Therefore I can relate to all famous and not famous people on the spectrum.,1478822400,,98,4.444444444444445
7738092,5,B01EKJOLTM,"This was a different view of autism. For me it opened up new questions.

I liked seeing the children having a good time, enjoying activities.",1477699200,,141,4.64
7738093,5,B01EKJOLTM,Very interesting look at sensory issues that often come with an ASD diagnosis. The film was thoughtfully done and allowed the subjects to relate their specific individual experience of sensory challenges/experiences in their own words. Sensory processing differences seem to be poorly understood and could be the cause of many seemingly odd behaviors. I appreciated that the film highlighted the challenges and also positive elements of heightened sensory perception. I wish there were more films like this!,1476057600,3,507,5.597402597402597
7738094,4,B01EKJOLTM,I only wish it had been longer. I am a mother to a child on the spectrum and I strive to understand how his little brain works! Loved the insight and seeing some awesome success stories!,1476057600,,186,4.194444444444445
7738095,5,B01EKJOLTM,I would like more of this,1475798400,,25,3.3333333333333335
7738096,5,B01EKJOLTM,this was a VERY good portrayal of autism straight from the POV of actual autistic people which was a  refreshing change from all the many videos and movies on here frm the point of view of a parent of an autistic kid or something and this made me feel really positive  about being autistic i loved it,1474934400,3,300,4.245614035087719
7738097,5,B01EKJOLTM,Very good insight into autism and the perception of people with autism.,1473897600,2,71,5.0
7738098,5,B01EKJOLTM,"The movie gave me a better understanding of how differently these individuals perceive the world around them, and how hard they have to work to navigate through society.",1472774400,,169,5.071428571428571
7738099,5,B01EKJOLTM,It provides a deeper and clearer understanding of autism,1467072000,2,56,5.333333333333333
7738100,4,B01EKJOLTM,"Hitching Temple Grandin's name to the piece is like a sports celebrity endorsing aftershave. It's the halo effect and little else. Beyond Ms. Grandin's intro voice-over, the piece is nicely done and, for me at least, delivered new understanding of autism spectrum disorder. The connection between sensory perception and autism is fascinating and the explanation given here seems clear without being clinical.",1466380800,,408,5.596774193548387
7738101,5,B01EKJOLTM,Amazing insight and education on this disorder...,1465689600,,49,6.142857142857143
7738102,5,B01EKJOLTM,I believe this helped me to understand the people on spectrum better by seeing things the way they perceive them.,1464652800,,113,4.7
7738103,5,B01EKJOLTM,"Very interesting. To hear directly from someone on the spectrum about there way of seeing life was very interesting.
Gives YOU a better perspective of special needs people.",1464566400,,172,5.178571428571429
7738104,5,B01EKJOLTM,"I have a 'knack' for finding autie movies :p I myself am on the spectrum and loved this piece. My own experience is through sound. I related to the poet, (because I write quiet a bit) I sing, music is the place I find balance.

Loved this little documentary. Well done.",1464566400,2,269,4.2745098039215685
7738105,5,B01EKJOLTM,I work with autistic children....and the documentary was spot on!,1464566400,2,65,5.6
7738106,5,B01EKJOLTM,"Beautiful and compassionate documentary! Most of the time, we see autism from the perspective of parents, teachers, or caretakers--people and organizations like Autism Speaks (absolutely a hate organization, do not support them) who treat autism as a problem that needs to be solved. We need more celebration of autistic people and more compassion for them as human beings.
I'll be recommending this to other neurotypical people I know, this really was a beautiful and genuinely positive documentary to watch.",1464220800,8,509,5.455696202531645
8759039,5,B01EKJOLTM,"What an elegant, humanistic movie. It combines science with beautiful illustrations and vignettes of the unique perceptions and niches that autistic folks have created. The music is nice and gentle too, and the cuts don't move too fast (i.e. the movie itself is gentle on the nerves). Highly recommended.",1534550400,,304,5.224489795918367
8759040,5,B01EKJOLTM,"Spectrum is beautiful. Never before have I seen such a story that can simultaneously educate and emulate autism as a subject so well. Its everything I could have asked for, as someone diagnosed on the autism spectrum myself.
 To think that a video like this could be constructed, and shown all over the country, is astonishing to me. As recently as a few decades ago, autism as a subject was still very much misunderstood and isolated  defined as an explicitly incorrect way of living life. To see the strides weve made as a population in such a relatively short amount of time is uplifting, enthralling. In a way, this video is a culmination of the suffering endured by those under autisms great umbrella of coverage and influence  individuals such as Temple Grandin, featured in Spectrum, who grew up in such a whirlwind of sensory issues and miscommunications, what have since sufficiently climbed the ladder of society, the hard way. Its these individuals that have spurred forth the research and development of treating and working with autism, as well as several other mental disorders, including ADHD and ADD. Spectrum is, in essence, their story, and their answer to the question, What do you mean, you don't think that way?
 And this is where Spectrum is given its true strength  empathy and understanding. I have to give congratulations to the amazing editors, musicians, artists, sound designers, and other technical staff that worked on this film, for how theyve helped to demonstrate autism to neurotypical persons. Autism is a sensory kerfuffle, a nebulous and omnipresent shifting of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and feelings. And so too is Spectrum  we have bizarre animations, startling imagery, heightened and disturbing sounds, bizarre movement, the list goes on and on. All this, featured between footage of persons with autism  the type of people we usually dismiss from an off appearance, or a noticeable difference in intelligence or social skills. These are the experiences these people endure for most of their lives.
 Most important is a breaking of stereotype  the people shown all exhibit widely different forms and variations of autism. We have developing children, and we have adults holding successful jobs. We see communication disorders, lack of eye contact, severe response to stimulus, inability to speak, and, most importantly, we see people who have broken the mold  people like the martial artist featured in Spectrum, who have utilized their disorder in their career, and have become so comfortable in their own skin that we cant tell if they have autism or not. This is what Spectrum concludes on  having journeyed from developing children to adults of various dispositions, various careers. The effect is all at once demonstrative of autism, as well as demonstrative of how much weve come to learn about it.
 This movie was phenomenal. Its an excellent primer concerning autism and autistic people to those unfamiliar with it. Im happy to see it  the movies almost a living proof to how far research on the Spectrum has advanced over the years. If it were up to me, Spectrum ought to be shown in all classes dealing with mental disabilities or development.",1523923200,3,3200,5.06083650190114
8759041,5,B01EKJOLTM,This movie is beautiful to watch and leads the viewer to a clearer understanding of perceptual differences. The storytelling and animation provide a world that the mind's eye challenges to create.,1521331200,,196,5.354838709677419
8759042,4,B01EKJOLTM,"good, used the info in a seminar i did for parents with children with autism.",1520640000,,77,4.2
8759043,5,B01EKJOLTM,One of the best documentaries that I have viewed. It shows such a positive and informative side of autism.,1515801600,,106,4.631578947368421
8759044,5,B01EKJOLTM,Really helpful to me to understand autistic people's feeling. I love this video so much.,1510099200,,88,4.933333333333334
8759045,5,B01EKJOLTM,"Everyone should see this beautiful film.  The presentations, the music, the animation, the  sheer magic of seeing the world through the minds of various autistic, gifted individuals.  Temple Grandin is a gift to the world, and what she says at the beginning of this film opens up tremendous research possibilities for years to come.",1509062400,,332,5.111111111111111
8759046,5,B01EKJOLTM,Great footage.,1508112000,,14,6.5
8759047,5,B01EKJOLTM,One of the most verbose and accurate ways I've ever seen sensory issues regarding Autism being described.,1506902400,,105,5.235294117647059
8759048,4,B01EKJOLTM,"This documentary using people-first perspective is a great beginning for those looking for more information on the world of persons living on the autism spectrum. But just as no one individual is the same as another, no one person living on the autism spectrum has the same perception as anyone else.

It would be helpful to have a documentary that also goes into how people living here and people who do not have autism can bridge the perceptual differences to get to know and respect one another better, especially in communities and public educational settings.",1505520000,,564,4.936842105263158
