8408122,2,B003XFYDPM,"The volume of the audio is extremely low compared to other videos.  10 to 15 db lower, according to the meters on my RME TotalMix display, if you want the details.  Yeah, you can solve this with the volume knob, but if you forget and play something else it is going to blast you out of your seat!  Plus you get a poor signal to noise ratio. I do not expect incredible sound or video quality out of a 1972 Stones concert.  That is not what I am complaining about, just the level.  I know the difference.

I sent feedback to Amazon,and they assured me that they had checked it and the problem was corrected.  They didn't check it or correct it of course, they just emailed a form message, hoping I would check MY equipment and that would fix the problem.",1482624000,3,752,4.253521126760563
