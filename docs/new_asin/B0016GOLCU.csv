8262496,5,B0016GOLCU,What more is there to say about Madhubala !!!,1522022400,,45,4.111111111111111
8262497,5,B0016GOLCU,"I only recently discovered Madhubala after watching Mughal e Azam on Netflix and have been mesmerized by her ever since.  She is truly a gifted actress.  Her facial expressions, graceful movements, timing, delivery, and dancing skills, not to mention timeless beauty, add up to one of the all-time best actresses I've ever seen.  Maybe I'm just smitten with her joyful and vivacious personality that comes across so well in this delightful comedy, I don't know, but I'm definitely on a quest now to watch as many of her films as I can find.  I could watch her all day!

Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi was very enjoyable to me, and I've only seen a hand full of Indian movies so far.  I love the silliness and Charlie Chaplin/Three Stooges-esque routines of the Kumar brothers.  Some of the humor might be a bit goofy for some, but I'm quite okay with it and actually find it quite refreshing after all the garbage that's in the theaters these days.  Love the 1950s shots of what I'm fairly certain is Madras/Chennai in the background (so little development and traffic!).  The music routines and songs are engaging, and the introduction of the sinister plot twist in the second half of the movie adds intrigue to a mostly fun and uplifting little story that I'll enjoy watching again.",1507939200,,1274,4.702702702702703

8262500,5,B0016GOLCU,This is one of the best comedy movies in Indian cinema. It was a legendary movie which bagged 6 Filmfare awards in 1958. It has some of the best evergreen songs including Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhagi Si... This is one of my favorite Bollywood movies.,1314662400,3,243,4.4222222222222225
