8332428,1,B001P810SW,Honestly this dvd sucked. I'm obsessed with volcanoes and have seen much better. It has ubsurd religious overtones which has nothing to do with geology or volcanology whatsoever. Not much science to this one. Just fairytale nonsense. Keep your religion out of our volcanology & scientific facts please.,1357862400,,302,5.3125
8332429,3,B001P810SW,"Wasn't really impressed with the documentary, but it was okay.  It was instantly downloaded to our TV with no problem.",1356825600,,118,4.9
8332430,4,B001P810SW,"This is a pretty good documentary. Having recently visited Mount St. Helen, we were interested in learning more. This documentary is a bit outdated but contains a good deal of information.",1346889600,,188,5.096774193548387
8332431,2,B001P810SW,"I was looking for DVDs on the Mt. St. Helens eruption to show my kids, so I ordered this one.  I teach in a Christian school and this production does have some religious themes, but the presentation, pacing and narration are all smack in the made-at-home-video zone.  The documentary footage was all gleaned from the public domain stuff that we've all seen many times.",1264809600,,368,4.734375
8332432,2,B001P810SW,"After visiting Mt. St. Helens, my wife and I became fascinated with the story surrounding the 1980 eruption. We both read an excellent book by Frank Parchman on the subject, and were looking for video of the events. While there was some excellent footage and first person accounts in the video, I was expecting much more. At least 15 minutes of footage (out of a total of around 45 minutes) was babbling brooks and vague background information. Also, it spent an inordinate amount of time on events after the original eruption. The people they interviewed seemed only to be peripherally involved in the event, including the geologist who gave an interesting, if a little lackluster, interview. The video definitely needed more footage of the immediate events. Given these problems, plus the amateurish production values, its hard to justify the $20 price tag.",1263772800,,859,5.056338028169014
