7880808,1,6305027048,"The song collection on this DVD sounded good, but I was disappointed by the presentation. For some reason the producers decided to accompany each song with a music video, but they are of such poor production quality (bad acting, direction, and dancing) that they detract from the music. Furthermore, none of the videos have anything to do with the songs they accompany. The worst was ""Would you lie to me?"" which had a woman alternately throwing things/yelling at her bored-looking boyfriend, then performing a seductive dance for him. (He still looked bored.) Since I bought the video for my kids (girls aged 8 and 9) based in part on the above review the innuendo is a real negative.
The idea of Karaoke is to be able to sing with the music. Unfortunately they melodies were flat in parts and the subtitles frequently out of sync. The worst was on my favorite song on the tape, ""Rapture."" The poor instrumentals made it hard to get the rythym of the song, and the onscreen lyrics were out of sync much of the time. I wished they'd put their money into more music, bag the videos, and spend more effort getting their subtitles together. Next time I'll just buy a Blondie CD and print the lyrics off the Internet.",977961600,,1213,4.62037037037037
7880809,4,6305027048,"The music (and videos) on this karaoke DVD are great.  If you know the original artist's version, you're in for a treat because these sound just like the original.  I love that you can use or turn off the vocal leads and also the background vocals.  My nine year old daughter, who doesn't even know most of these songs used the leads and learned the songs quickly.  It's one of the better karaoke compilations I've used.",970099200,,420,4.4868421052631575
