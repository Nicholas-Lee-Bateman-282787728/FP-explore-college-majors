Unfortunately, i'm always looking for any useful or additional perspectives on treating serious behavior problems. Unfortunately, this dvd offered neither and actually offered less than i already know! Very disappointed, had i been able to return this, i definitely would have. I didn't even get past the first 30 minutes, if that! Unfortunate side effect buying this type of product.",1405036800,,490,5.294871794871795

The first section is geared towards proactive steps. The second section has the ""I'll be Back"" technique which trains the dog how to stay contently in a house when you are gone. The third sections has a great troubleshooting guide for more difficult dogs. The forth section shows you two ways to desensitize your dog to your leaving. The case study demonstrates a new creative technique which really solves problems in severe cases. This video offers enough information to help everyone find a way to resolve their dog's separation anxiety problems.",1357603200,,707,4.949579831932773
