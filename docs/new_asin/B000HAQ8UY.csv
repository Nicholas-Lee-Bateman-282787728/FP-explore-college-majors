8137902,5,B000HAQ8UY,"This movie is absolutely incredible
featuring some of the actors from War and Peace, the cast is an amazing ensemble of great Russian film and stage actors, a real ""they don't make em like they used to"" film.
The storyline is amazing, with each part of the movie (I & II) providing for amazingly different environments that truly help to depict the heartbreak of the people who fled Russia during the civil war. Loaded symbolism throughout, the movie exists on a surreal allegorical level, paying homage to its roots as one of Bulgakov's finest stories.
The actors in this movie draw you in, not always with outspoken performances, but also with powerful moments of silence, as they reflect on their loss of a Russia that they can no longer stay in. The characters range from the highest of generals to the everyday intellectual, all fleeing the changing wind of Communist victory.
Gorgeous scenes of the Russia countryside, grand scenes of combat, beautiful scenes of the cities the exiles live in, and terrifying surreal landscapes all come together to provide a film like no other.
Superb!",1231891200,3,1092,4.908108108108108
8137903,5,B000HAQ8UY,"A fine transfer of the restored version of this film, plus several fascinating ""extras""--the Kremlin archival material was a surprise.  To read the censor's report to the Party leadership in the 1920's...
The story follows a couple trapped with the losing side in the Russian Civil War. A Noah's Ark of refugees goes into exile...
This is a generally faithful version of the story Bulgakov wrote in the 1920's--very well cast, and well-played.  Khludov's flashbacks to the war are done with imagination. This mixture of satire, tragedy, fantasy, romance doesn't fit easily into any category.",1226793600,3,591,5.2105263157894735
