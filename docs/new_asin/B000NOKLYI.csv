2774949,5,B000NOKLYI,"I am a beginner at learning Qigong and have watched this DVD 2x. I've practiced 'embryonic' breathing off/on (whenever I remember to do it).

I've also watched the first DVD in this series and a lot of background from DVD #1 is included here, which is fine.

My first breathing practice, I performed before watching the entire DVD. I missed the part about don't do this in the winter (inhale longer than exhale) and got the chills. I finished the DVD and thought, that warning should have been mentioned earlier.

It's been 2 months since I've started the practice and I seriously can ID my family, friends & coworkers' intentions and thoughts. I can't be sure if this is hallucinations or if my 3rd eye has open. I also don't feel anger when negative thoughts are forward to me; I feel that they are not important.

DH told me that I have become very forgetful since starting yoga and 'breathing' exercises. The forgetfulness was also a warning in DVD #1.",1314748800,3,956,4.605882352941176
2774950,5,B000NOKLYI,"Dr. Yang eloquently outlines his understanding of embryonic breathing on this enjoyable DVD.  Throughout the course of the video seminar, he simplifies the main concepts and explains how this form of meditation is relevant and useful even today.  In the video, Dr. Yang describes how to work into and progress with this form of meditation, what the practitioner can expect, and the benefits/pitfalls of which one should be aware.

After viewing the video, you will have a good idea of what embryonic breathing is all about.  This doesn't mean you will be able to do it, but it is a starting point and will help complement what you learn from instruction and hands-on experience.  I would highly suggest viewing this video a time or two prior to reading the ""Qigong Meditation:  Embryonic Breathing"" book if you wish to better comprehend and retain the subject matter of the text.",1305936000,10,879,4.905405405405405

2774952,2,B000NOKLYI,"Despite all the 5 Star reviews, this DVD is not for beginners of QiGong, unless you want a lot of history.  If you are looking for a DVD with QiGong excersizes for everyday, this is not it.",1272412800,2,189,4.108108108108108

With this new addition of Understanding Qigong Pt. 3, I have been blown away again by the quality of material that is being presented.  I'm also starting to doubt my ability to learn from books.  Even though I own every book published by Dr. Yang on Qigong, somehow his presentation on these DVDs is much more effective in presenting the material.  After watching this series on Qigong, I ask myself, did I really read the book.  I certainly plan to re-read the books after watching the DVDs.

This DVD focuses on Embryonic Breathing, and has the following sections:

Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming has collected all of the available writings on Qigong that have been made available since the Cultural Revolution and has made it his goal to translate the material and make it available to the public in a format that can be understood.  Too many books on Qigong use very symbolic and abstract terms that are basically incomprehensible to the average reader.

When reading his books or watching his DVDs, the viewer is provided with the translation, which has many abstract terms, as well as a further breakdown into explanations that actually make sense and can be used by anyone seeking to learn the techniques.  Besides presenting the material in a usable manner, Dr. Yang poses questions throughout the presentation that encourage the reader/viewer to ponder and question the material in a way that leads to better understanding.

Many times I have seen Dr. Yang present a concept and before I can vocalize my questions, he is already posing them.

Dr. Yang begins the discussion with Taiji theory and its long history, beginning almost four thousand years ago with the I Ching.  Without an understanding of the concept of Wuji, Taiji and how they lead to the creation of Yin Yang, a taijiquan practitioner will never reach the higher levels of the art.

Taiji can mean Grand Ultimate, or God, or The Force, if one is a Star Wars fan.  Taiji, being the Dao of Nature, creates things from emptiness, that being Wuji.  If one views the drawings of Taiji prior to it separating into Yin and Yang, it resembles a spiral, similar to the spiral in DNA.  As our human body comes from nature, the energy patterns in the human body copy the energy patterns in nature.

We start the Taiji form by entering Wuji, or emptiness.  As the concept of Taiji enters our mind, then it separates into Yin and Yang and we are able to differentiate between substantial and insubstantial.

Unfortunately, I've witnessed many people who will begin their form without understanding or carrying out the transformation from Wuji to Taiji to Yin and Yang.

The mind, as powerful and limitless as it is, can be used for good or evil.  Dr. Yang describes how human beings, as they learned to lie, cheat and steal from one another, developed the human matrix.  Within this matrix we all wear masks and cover our true intentions and nature.  This in turn is one of the factors that led to the loss of the third eye, which helps people to mask their true selves.  As we practice Embryonic Breathing and come more into tune with our true selves, we can possibly bring back some of the abilities and benefits available from the third eye.

If you look at the Yin Yang symbol, the upper dot in the Yang side represents the upper brain, or upper dan tien, and the lower dot represents the lower brain, or lower dan tien.  Connecting these two brains is the spinal cord (thrusting vessel), which links them together and leads to nourishment.  In function, they are one brain and synchronize with one another.  The upper brain controls the quality of life and the lower brain controls the quantity of life.  As each have the seed of each other, witness the dots in the teardrop shapes in the Yin Yang symbol, they help to balance each other through mutual influence.

There are twelve channels in the body, with six leading to the arms and six to the legs.

By using Embryonic Breathing to build the Qi in the two channels, the Governing and Conception channels, then the 12 channels will be strong and able to distribute energy to the entire body, including the internal organs, which is where one end of each channel is connected.

As Dr. Yang explains, once the material is presented properly, the theory of Embryonic Breathing is simple and the practice of it is straight forward.

Well, I have over thirty pages of notes from watching this DVD, and I feel like I shouldn't write anymore, as it would be nice to save a lot of the goodies on this DVD for when you view it.

Trust me on this, the series on Qigong has so far been absolutely fantastic.  I wait with great anticipation for the remaining DVDs of the series to be released.

As I've said many times, the martial arts community owes a great debt to Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming for his tireless efforts to provide usable information to seekers of this knowledge.  Combined with David Silver's high level of production in the direction and making of this DVD, they have a winning combination.",1175299200,48,6248,4.7790262172284645
8180086,5,B000NOKLYI,Embryonic is one of the more difficult breathing exercise in Qigong.  This DVD and the associated book clarified the process and placed it in appropriate historical context.  It helped me to correct an error in my technique.  Highly recommended for serious students of Qigong.,1526860800,,276,5.2272727272727275
8180087,5,B000NOKLYI,Very educational. Being a Qigong practitioner  I enjoy researching and studying Chinese concepts related to chi kung and tai chi. While this is not for a beginner it is a must for the serious qigong or martial artist. I suggest getting both the book Qigong Meditation: Embryonic Breathing and Qigong Meditation: Small Circulation by the same author to pull more together. A great wealth of information.,1482364800,,402,5.090909090909091

8180090,5,B000NOKLYI,"Each of the dvds in the 18 hour, 6-dvd collection ""Understanding Qigong"" is another masterpiece by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming!  The purpose of this work is to help the student understand Qigong, and each dvd effectively addresses a key aspect of the subject ""Qigong"" in a way that is truly educational and valuable for the student's understanding and development.  All of the information provided in each dvd is so important in developing a foundation upon which to build all future future Chi development and/or Martial Arts training. I would highly recommend that the interested student purchase the entire 6-dvd set for their own benefit.  The student will also find that these works are referenced as the source of ""further in-depth information"" in other of Dr. Yang's amazing works.  As in all areas of life, an effective and powerful end product requires an effective and powerful foundation upon which the end product is built.  This work by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming offers the student that foundation.",1418947200,,999,5.104294478527607
8180091,5,B000NOKLYI,"Even if you have a good understanding and fairly complete knowledge of Qigong this series will have more for you to learn.  As far as I can tell Dr. Yang has the most complete and researched knowledge of qigong out of any one that makes DVDs or books.  If you are looking at this then you aren't beyond his level, because if you were you'd have no interest or need to research the subject.

Amazon tends to be cheaper or the same price as YMAA website, but I think you can buy the series as a bundle from YMAA and save some money vs buying them individually.",1394064000,,558,4.196261682242991

8180093,5,B000NOKLYI,"This is the second DVD I have gotten by Dr. Yang, and find his teachings fascinating. Dr. Yang has a PhD in Engineering, and is a physicist. His teachings take what could be classified as esoteric teachings and gives it a scientific explanation, including how the human energy system works. He also compiles thousands of years of teachings into a relatively short and concise lecture, with whiteboard illustrations of the ideas he is trying to convey.

I've read many books on Chinese martial arts, energy systems, esoteric healing, etc., and find that the information contained in this DVD lecture series is essential for understanding not only the background of the martial arts and meditation practices, but also any energetic healing modality. I also very much appreciate the way he addresses women's energies and how they are different from mens'in this DVD.

Very thorough, very erudite, very fascinating. Many AHA! moments for me.",1359763200,,937,5.157894736842105
