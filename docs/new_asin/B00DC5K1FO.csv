5788230,5,B00DC5K1FO,"While some people may think that only Hitchcock can do a classic,I tend to believe that..while there is sometimes a remake on a classic it is not taking anything away from the orginal..Granted some remakes just really suck! But I found this one to be very detailed..loved the part where Iris thinks she is going crazy..especially when they bring in another woman who looks alot like Ms. Froy..but just isn't..I think it was done with alot of class and very good actors like Julian Rhind-Tutt and Keeley Hawes for example..the director knew what he was doing...there are some people who say..""Oh don't touch Superman for instance..in the case of Man Of Steel and the 1980's Superman Christopher Reeve..I just say we are bringing Superman into the 21st Century...as like with this movie...some movies and shows can tend to look a little bit dated..{and need a remake}...like your old Miss Marples from the 1980's and 1990's with Joan Hickson...But you bring in fresh faces like Geraldine McEwan,etc...it again doesn't take away from the classic but I feel maybe adds..a little bit more to it...in 1938 you can love that one and this one...But I like the fact that...they colored this one, while Hitchcocks was black and white.....but you can have the best of both worlds I believe....know one is taking anything away from anyone..I still enjoy older shows though I know what people mean..like for instance Leave Her To Heaven with Gene Tierney...who teeters on the edge of insanity..or Laura also Gene Tieney...it is hard to top Ms. Tierney..or Gilda w/Rita Hayworth",1377648000,3,1564,4.996168582375479
5788231,1,B00DC5K1FO,"It is hard for me to be objective, since I had already seen the original version from 1939.  For my part, I think the original is ""hands down"" better than this one. In the first place, one would have to be pretty amazing to improve on Hitchcock's direction; perhaps that is why it is rarely tried. In the second place, this  film lacks all the luster of a good mystery. the characters are shallow and the plot is given away without the typical unfolding of clues.  It really left me longing to watch the original version, just to get the taste out of my mouth, so to speak.  My advise is to skip this one and watch the 1938 version.

5788255,4,B00DC5K1FO,"The 1938 version of ""The Lady Vanishes"" was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and is considered one of his best films.
This latest version of this classic is, however, very different from the one you might have seen in the past. Unlike Hitchcock's film. this version is much more faithful to the novel on which it was based (""The Wheel Spins"" by Ethel Lina White.) As a result, those who have seen the 1938 film will likely feel that the two movies have little in common.
Both are set on a train bearing passengers from a small Balkan country to London. During the journey an older woman who has befriended a young Englishwoman disappears. When the young woman attempts to find her she discovers that all the other passengers deny ever having seen the older lady for various reasons. In the 1938 film, the older woman is a spy for the British foreign service trying to get to England so she can relay some valuable information. In both the book and this 2013 version the older woman is a governess who has seen something that is potentially damaging to the government of the small Balkan country. She is kidnapped to prevent her from revealing what she knows about the murder of a young English intellectual.
This version is a well made period piece with some fine actors including Tuppence Middleton as the heroine - Iris Carr - and Tom Hughes as her would-be suitor Max Hare. The pace of the film is on point and the narrative, though a little choppy in some places, generally flows along without confusing the viewer. The problem, for me, with the film is that Middleton's character seems to generate little sympathy and has no real credibility with the other travelers. She is so rude and so high-handed that she is not likable enough for anyone to take her seriously. My sense is that she needed at least one redeeming feature to help me, as a viewer, see her in a more sympathetic light.
A nice movie that perhaps tries a little too hard but is still worth a look.",1445990400,15,1965,4.553672316384181

5788258,1,B00DC5K1FO,"The Lady Vanishes, 2013 film

It begins at a lake where young women talk. There is a dinner. A man talks about his wife to a young woman. There is an argument. The next day they leave in cars. A young woman with a very short dress (above the knees!) walks in the country. Are the people what they seem to be? That young woman is advised to carry a gun when walking in the mountains. An older woman gets a telegram. That woman insists on a train ticket so she can return to London; then she faints. Sunstroke? But she boards the train as it leaves the station. She talks to an older woman. Later she falls asleep. When she awakes the Englishwoman has vanished! The other passengers deny that womans existence. [What happened?]

Does anyone here speak English? she asks. A young man stands up to help her. She is told this is the result of sunstroke by a foreign doctor. What motive would the Baroness have or the others to lie? Has anyone else seen Miss Froy? She looks ordinary. The ministers wife remembers. The young lady (Miss Carr) talks to the young man. Then she is told Miss Froy reappeared. But its not Miss Froy! The story runs on. How could she disappear from a train in transit? Is Miss Carr unbalanced? The Balkans are full of intrigue, she is told. They are worried about Miss Carr; will she go to a rest home? A couple has their reason for their silence - no publicity. Who has a motive? Could Miss Froy be hidden away?

The train stops at the frontier for a customs inspection. Miss Carr is very upset or high strung says the doctor. Miss Carr thinks Miss Froy was taken out at the train stop. The Doctor recommends a sedative for Iris. Drink a sip she is told. They arrive at Trieste. Will they discover Miss Froy in time? Yes. Miss Froy plans to return to testify at that murder trial (the brother of the Baroness). Will Iris see her young man again? [Probably not.]

Ive seen the 1938 version of TLV and the 1979 version (which lacks the censorship of the earlier version). Both are superior to this tepid version which censors or omits parts of the original versions. Who paid for this version? Was it to censor scenes which told too much about the past? I think the funds would be better spent on recreating Eric Amblers early novels, which were turned into movies that are unavailable today. They were masterpieces of intrigue.",1443225600,2,2348,4.4282407407407405

5788287,3,B00DC5K1FO,"The Lady Vanishes is a 2012/2013 British drama and mystery film directed by Diarmuid Lawrence and is a co-production of the BBC (first broadcast in March 2013 on BBC One) and Masterpiece Films. Based on the 1936 novel The Wheel Spins by Ethel Lina White (1876-1944), it stars Selina Cadell in the key role of the disappearing Miss Froy, Tuppence Middleton as the young Iris Carr (who discovers the disappearance, but is not taken seriously), and Tom Hughes and Alex Jennings as Max Hare and the Professor, the two fellow English passengers who come to her aid.

According to Wikipedia, the film is less a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1938 film of the same name than a new interpretation of the novel, one based far more closely on it. It depicts a young and beautiful English socialite, Iris Carr, travelling by train across 1930s Europe, returning to England from Croatia. She is alarmed by the mysterious disappearance of a woman, Miss Froy, also travelling on the train. She enlists the help (initially given somewhat reluctantly) of the handsome young Max Hare, and his former Oxford Professor, who are travelling together on the train.. The setting of the remake is the luxury express passenger train from Croatia to Trieste, rather than in the original fictional country. An entire 1930s luxury passenger train interior, complete with sleeping carriages, a dining car, and a passenger bar and lounge car, were all recreated in Budapest for the production of this film adaptation.

Despite the plush and intriguing setting and excellent supporting cast, the film is marred by the casting of the unknown Tuppence Middleton as the young socialite who enlists the help of her fellow train passengers to find Miss Froy.  Middleton is quite believable as a spoiled rich girl who bribes a station attendant for a last seat on the train, but she lacks the pedigree to carry the film.  One could almost wish to replace her with a young Margaret Lockwood who played the part in the Hitchcock 1938 film.

The plot and characterization changes from the earlier film are dramatic.  An English governess disappears, not as a clever M-16 British agent, but as a witness to a sensational European murder.  The occupants of the train are skeptical observers of a rather frivolous young woman's dilemma and are almost Agatha Christie-like in their connections to the story. Miss Marple is replaced by two other nosey biddies.  A handsome young man (Tom Hughes) saves the day.  A beautiful and mysterious woman (Keeley Hawes) having an affair with a British lord and a frustrated minister's wife (Gemma Jones) finally ignore a sinister Baroness (Benedikte Hansen) and come to the aid of our young heroine.

It's too bad the heroine doesn't deserve much aid...

Still, the actors are fun to watch, the scenery is beautiful and it's a pleasant little mental and visual outing.

5788291,4,B00DC5K1FO,"""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938) is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films, and I can't imagine why anyone would attempt a remake, but this version produced for television by the BBC and Masterpiece Films is not as bad as I expected. I might have preferred an updated, modern version incorporating 21st century Balkan politics and high speed rail trains, but the filmmakers preferred the romanticism and exoticism of pre-War Europe. This film is supposedly based more closely on the 1936 novel ""The Wheel Spins"" by Ethel Lina White than the Hitchcock film was. I've not read the book, so I cannot comment on the adaptation, but the BBC film lacks the comedic elements of Hitchcock's film. It's a straight dramatic thriller.

Iris Carr (Tuppence Middleton) is young English socialite vacationing in the Balkans with a group of friends. She decides to depart early and is able to bribe a ticket agent for a seat on a sold-out train but finds herself unconscious and then disoriented at the train station shortly after and manages to catch her train with difficulty. Iris is seated in a compartment with a Baroness (Benedikte Hansen) and her family and Miss Winifred Froy (Selina Cadell), a middle-aged Englishwoman who was employed by the Baroness' brother. Miss Froy is very friendly toward Iris, but, as she is still suffering from a throbbing headache following the incident at the train station, Iris avoids Miss Froy's chatter and falls asleep. When she wakes, she finds that Miss Froy and her baggage are gone. When Iris inquires as to where they went, everyone in the compartment denies that Miss Froy ever existed.

This film gets off to a rocky start. Iris Carr is not likeable. She's a brat. There is a superfluous scene of Iris' minor mishaps while hiking in the mountains. She claims to believe that a mark on her hand protects her from harm. Why did this stuff not end up on the cutting room floor -or whatever people do with junk digital footage? When we get to the train and the mystery, the editing improves, but Iris is still not likeable. She's never likable. So the filmmakers have their work cut out for themselves in making her sympathetic. They succeed, because Iris is a stranger in a strange land, on a train where she does not speak the language or understand the politics, and people who do are conspiring against her. She can barely cope, because she has a headache. She's in real danger, and we sense that. So this is a solid made-for-television period thriller, after a few early rough spots.",1377734400,2,2516,4.781609195402299

This is one of those movies where the casting was great but the direction was poor. I only bought the movie because of the 4 stars and I regret the purchase. I stopped watching because it was a waste of time and money,1500940800,,342,4.196969696969697

8591591,4,B00DC5K1FO,"This 2013 BBC movie is a remake of the 1938 film by Hitchcock. It is a little better than ok, but it is too frenetic, lacks humor, has no subtlety, the actors seem to be trying too hard to be good, and if one pays a little more than average attention, one will hear why the woman disappears near the beginning of the film. It is about a rich pampered young woman who boards a train to return to England. Just before boarding, she is told that something is wrong with the train compartment for which she buys a ticket and as she is waiting for the train, she faints. Neither she nor us know if it is the result of sunstroke or someone hit her on the back of her head. She finds most of the people who were with her at the hotel where she stayed for a while. A woman befriends her and chatters on and our heroine does not listen. This woman disappears. Our heroine tries to find her. Everyone tells her there was no such woman on the train. She perseveres. Soon people think she is crazy.",1491177600,,986,4.140625
