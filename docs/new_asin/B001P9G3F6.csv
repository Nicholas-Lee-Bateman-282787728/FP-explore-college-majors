3744156,5,B001P9G3F6,"This is one of the best films I've seen - documentary or otherwise. It's subtitled in English, thankfully, because a voice-over dub would detract from the emotion expressed by the survivors (and everyone else) in the film.

The uncensored revelation of the facts behind the entire event is a brutal, raw example of the worst-case scenario - way beyond the worst nightmare imaginable - and how people who are just like you and me rose above themselves to do something monumental, inspiring and life-changing. This amazing group of individuals used every fiber of their being to stay alive, to see their loved ones again, and to honor those who had perished and explain their life-saving sacrifices.

The group had no alternative for survival other than by performing the unimaginable, which they did with incredible intelligence and reasoning - intertwined with faith, dignity, respect and love. The degree of determination, presence of mind, and amazing unselfishness that inspired their actions may be almost unfathomable to the of majority of people, because thankfully so few of us are ever put to that kind of test.

The individual descriptions of the events are filled with the spiritual, heartfelt and utterly heart-wrenching feelings of these men. The shocking, sensitive aspects were explained in a way that left me with a complete understanding and empathy toward the individuals and the decisions behind their actions. It's plain to see what led them to do anything and everything in their power in an attempt to survive. They had no choice, because they knew they would not be rescued by any other method than their own faith, drive and ingenuity to make it happen.

The final, death-defying feat that resulted in their rescue after 72 days in hell is irrefutable evidence - in my opinion - of the existence of a power much greater than we are. Surviving the 44 mile journey over 13,000 foot peaks with no equipment, very little to eat and unsuitable clothing in their 10-day ordeal to reach salvation is a true miracle. For those who don't believe in a higher power, you'll appreciate the miracle of the human race and it's ability to overcome adversity. For those who believe in the Creator, appreciate the miracle that it is among so many others and marvel at this example of the human race and it's ability to overcome adversity through faith.

The film pays a highly deserved tribute to everyone who was affected by this tragedy. Their experience and ultimate triumph is an inspiration to anyone who will listen. I can't imagine how anyone could view this and not be affected in some way.",1245542400,34,2604,4.922551252847381
3744157,5,B001P9G3F6,"The story of the 1972 plane crash in the Andes and the struggles of the men aboard to survive seems to pop into the public awareness periodically over the three decades since it happened. ""Stranded"" is the latest documentary on the subject, and it's the best I've seen. All 16 survivors participated. Director Gonzalo Arijon incorporates grainy, impressionistic, silent reenactments of the scenes the men describe. This enhances the audience's picture of the events without usurping the gripping commentary of the survivors. The combination of interviews, some archival footage, and the dreamlike reenactments, which seem like memories, make this retelling of the story more engrossing than any narrative adaptation.

On Friday, October 13, 1972, a college rugby team from Montevideo, Uruguay set out on Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 to Santiago, Chile, where they were to compete in a match. Having changed its route to avoid inclement weather, the plane descended too early over the mountains, severed both wings, and crash-landed high in the snow-covered Andes. Of the 45 people aboard, 29 survived the crash, 23 uninjured. They didn't have adequate clothing for the freezing conditions. Many had never seen snow before. And, even strictly rationed, food would only last a few days. They hoped to be rescued but could hear on the radio that the aerial search was called off due to heavy snow. And yet 16 of the young men spent 72 days on the mountain and lived to talk about it.

All survivors participated, but some say more than others. Fernando ""Nando"" Parrado, who wrote a book about his experiences, seems to have been a leader after the group lost its team captain. Roberto Canessa, who, with Nando, was responsible for the rescue, is the most pensive and analytical of the experience. Gustavo Zerbina is vibrant and opinionated. Those who had the strongest voices on the mountain have the most to say today. The film places no more emphasis on the men's cannibalism than on any other element of their story, for which I am grateful. I've never understood the fascination with the cannibalism. It's the least interesting aspect of the ordeal. This is an incredible story of survival and escape against all odds and against the indifference and supremacy of Nature. In Spanish with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Zeitgeist 2009): Bonus features are a US trailer (2 min) and a featurette, ""The Making of Stranded"" (52 min). This is a loosely organized mix of interviews with survivors that were cut from the final edit of the film, some brief interviews with the director on location, in which he emphasizes that this film is about the experiences of the men, not about action, and we spend time with some of the survivors as they relate more details of their experiences to the young actors who will portray them. Both the film and featurette are in Spanish with optional English subtitles.",1241913600,38,2906,5.0
3744158,4,B001P9G3F6,"In 1972, the small plane carrying a rugby team from Uruguay crashed in the Andes. After 72 days stranded in the cold and snow, 16 of the original 45 passengers were rescued. For the first time, survivors tell the incredible story in their own words, including the notorious cannibalism that saved their lives.

Atmospheric recreations, narrated by the survivors, give a chilling sense of the wilderness, isolation, and brutal conditions these people endured. When a group of survivors return to the scene of the crash in 2006 to pay their respects, filmmakers follow. Many of the survivors are accompanied by their children, some the same age as their fathers when the accident occurred. Sitting amid the gorgeous snow-capped peaks of The Valley of Tears 35 year later, these men are able to articulate their experience, including rare moments of profound beauty, in language that is heartfelt and hopeful.",1236643200,21,906,5.121621621621622

The movie reenacts, with great sensitivity, discretion and compassion, a human drama that will compel the viewer to look both inward and outward on matters of survival, spiritual truth, and existential  despair.  To me, it is an essential film and an important film for its ability to involve the viewer in an unimaginable experience.

I felt that the documentary allowed a more in depth connection with the survivors and the horrible experience of being stranded for over 70 days in the Andes mountains.

3744196,4,B001P9G3F6,"OK I gotta confess: this is a serious documentary about a bad accident, and I got tense enough I had to pause in the middle.  I still haven't finished the WHOLE THING (it's 2 hours long) but the first half was interesting enough to make an excellent movie, all on its own.

There was a much earlier film that was a dramatization of this incident.  This film takes the actual survivors back to the scene, and interviews many of them about what they were thinking, experiencing, feeling at the time.  It manages to walk you through the accident, from airport goodbyes to (no doubt) the rescues, both from the perspective of the participants and from some family members, and the efforts they made to try to find the plane and passengers, and at the same time to intersperse, without causing any disorientation in time, the current thoughts of the survivors about the event and their lives.

You can view this from any perspective, it is still a gripping story.  I like hearing people tell their own stories, rather than having them re-enacted, when that's possible.",1408147200,,1063,4.718918918918919
3744197,5,B001P9G3F6,"Love love love this documentary. Thought about it for weeks afterward. It's hard to imagine a story about young men and women being stuck on a mountain after a plane crash and having to eat the carcasses of their dead companions to survive as being uplifting, but it really is. So much more than a grim survival story, it's a story about community and what it means to be human. Almost impossible to describe without sound gory or maudlin, but it's fascinating.

 re-creation footage (a technique I usually despise, but is done here so deftly that it works),

What I like best about it are the interviews; the survivors are eloquent, articulate and they share their experiences with great candor and intimacy. The film is respectful, it doesn't sensationalize the event, it's not voyeuristic or CNN or FOX-ish.

One doesn't feel like a ghoul or vulture watching it.

The film doesn't manipulate the viewers emotions or try to project the producer's interpretation of the survivors' characters or experience. They are shown as people not heroes (which they are in my eyes) or two dimensional characters.  The director lets them speak for themselves.  The documentary is patient; telling the story meticulously.

One reviewer said it was slow and boring, but the pace I felt, gave you a sense of their experience.  After the crash it wasn't exciting and action packed.  They were young men plodding through their experience, focused on surviving-- bored, restless, scared, hopeless, hopeful, depressed, and hungry.  It is a story of endurance and faith, they had their patience, intelligence, moral fiber and psyche severely tested.  The film does a good job of creating that experience for the viewer.

There just wasn't much recorded material of the plane crash except for a few blurry photographs.  I think this would have made for an interesting book, but as a documentary there just isn't enough... and the pace is quite slow (the film is 2 hours long).",1283472000,8,544,4.6947368421052635
3744223,5,B001P9G3F6,"I spend a couple of months living in Chile as a foreign exchange studet in 1969.  It was a life-changing event for me and left me with an eagle eye for anything in the news having to do with Chile.  Thus I caught the story of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plan went down in the Chilean Andes back in 1972.  I followed the stories of the search and the despair and I was flabbergasted like everyone else when survivors were discovered two months later.  Like most others, I wondered how they could have survived for so long in the mountains.  Well, the explanation for that became front page news as a modern-day remake of the infamous Donner Party.  Later, after the Allende regiem was overthrown and the CIA slipped into the back pages, I got a copy of the book ""Alive"" and found myself even more engrossed in this gruesomely fantastic tale of courage and perserverance.  Later I watched the movie version of ""Alive"" which was also well done.  What was there left except, perhaps, an occassional cheap exploitation film?  Well, how about the story in the words of the survivors in a documentary done with professionalism and empathy.  That is what I found in ""Stranded"".

This movie isn't just a filmed series of interviews; many, if not all, of the survivors made the trip back to the scene of their terrible ordeal 35 years later.  Their stories told us so much more than we had known before and their eloquence of survivalism was profound.  What really got to me was a sense that I had gotten to know these people and now I was getting to know them even more intimately.  I remember recently reading ""The Indifferent Stars Above"" about the Donner Party and hearing the tale of a member of that party who survived for decades after the tragic experience yet never spoke a word about her experience.  I can understand that yet I can also appreciate the sense of common stuggle that bonded these Andean survivors.  They tell their story as a sort of band of brothers whose only path to survival was to work together in a common cause.

The old adage ""Truth is stranger than Fiction"" comes alive in ""Stranded"".  What an accomplishment by these young men and what an accomplishment by director Gonzalo Arijon in putting it together.  This was one of those rare movies that left me numb and speechless after watching it.",1273536000,8,2319,4.598540145985401
3744224,5,B001P9G3F6,"This is a very well-made documentary that combines interviews, archival footage, re-enactments, and even a modern trek back to the Valley of Tears in the Andes, where the Uruguayan men and women crashed in 1972.  Everyone knows the story, but you've never heard it like this.  The survivors are still living near each other and they still have raw memories of the terrible ordeal they endured for more than two months before finding their way out of it.

Although they had to resort to cannibalism, their justification of it is both moving and highly rational.  No one had any business condemning them for it.  There was absolutely nothing else to eat, and they were determined to survive.

Excellent and emotional film.",1258416000,5,720,4.909090909090909
3744225,5,B001P9G3F6,"I have long been fascinated with this event. This film is the first coverage of the story to actually bring home to me how amazing it was that any of those boys survived and how great a distance -- both mentally and physically -- they were from the rest of the world.

As the now-grown men tell their tale in their own brutally honest words, you can't help but feel great admiration for all of them, even those who didn't make it out of the mountains. It's a heartbreaking and awe-inspiring story.",1257897600,6,497,4.4021739130434785
3744226,5,B001P9G3F6,One of the best documentaries I have ever seen it says a lot about human capacity for suffering and the instinct to live and survive. I had a huge amount of empathy for the survivors and am in awe of the director's skill in bringing them together to tell this amazing tale. Highly highly recommended!,1252800000,7,300,4.472727272727273
3744227,5,B001P9G3F6,"This is an absolutely amazing story of faith, endurance and perseverance.  The tale is understated with narrative first-person flashbacks of the Andes crash survivors.  An original and lean piano music score perfectly complements the grim yet inspiring tale of how these men survived.

At the end, I watched through tears as I saw their expediency in the mountain as a type of sacrificial eucharist.

This riveting Documentary tells the story of an event many of us still remember-the crash of a plane in the Andes carrying members of an Uruguay College Rugby Team, on their way to a game in Chile.
It was Friday, October 13th, 1972 when the plane, buffeted by high winds and blinding snow-hit a peak that sheared off its wings, cracked and broke off the rear fuselage and sent the remaining cabin sliding down into white nothingness. When it finally came to a stop at the bottom of a valley-one survivor called the ensuing minutes of intense silence as ""peaceful.""
Then grim reality set in.
As survivors began to slowly ""come to,"" the horror and desperation of their situation became all too obvious. Many couldn't understand how they had survived with little more than a black eye, while a best friend or family member sitting next to them perished.
Remember, most of the survivors were just kids-19 or 20-and had little or no experience with death. One young man held held his dying sister for two days, until her injuries stopped her heart.
A small radio somehow survived, and for a few days-the young men (and one unharmed woman) optimistically listened to news stories about their planes' disappearance and the many rescue parties looking for it. Inevitably-their fate finally became ""yesterday's news,"" with authorities agreeing it would be fruitless to continue looking for a white needle (the plane) buried somewhere under thousands of miles of white haystacks. The Andes Mountains are bitterly cold, covered with snow and have thousands of deep cracks and crevices. These mountains are prone to constant avalanches and almost never give up their secrets. Or their dead.
The remaining survivors (26-29?) were now on their own, and knew only that they would live or die based on every single decision they made.
And thus began a 70+day ordeal that would see only 16 men, skeletons all-return to the land of the living.
They cannibalized the dead to live, but did so only after much discussion, along with reverence and great respect. Many were slightly comforted by the fact that each still living offered their bodies to their friends should they die-which indeed some did when an avalanche buried the plane in the middle of the night.
The deceased team-mates were as revered as the body and blood of Christ, and the identity of the remains were kept anonymous from the group when they ate.
Their rescue is the stuff of legend-when two emaciated members set out to find help or die trying. The film expresses this ordeal far better than I could ever try.
Some 30+plus years later-these now middle aged men along with members of their own families return to the spot where it all started. The plane is long gone, swallowed by time and the avalanches of the Andes. The plane and the bodies still inside reside in ""sacred ground,"" but those that perished are not forgotten. A large shrine and many smaller ones now decorate the landscape with photos, rosaries and names.
The men discuss and describe what they were then and how they got to where they are now. Each man seems to be at peace with their group decision to use the bodies of their comrades as fuel to survive-and it also appears they remain a close and loving group to this day.
If you believe in the power of survival-even if it means crossing a so-called ""social taboo,"" you'll cheer and empathize with the terrible lack of options these young men chose to use in a respectful, caring and yes-loving fashion.
This is a beautiful tale of survival and peace with ones self-and is simply excellent. I, along with many I'm sure, have wondered what became of these men, and am very glad I watched this brilliant piece of film making and found out.",1483920000,2,3753,4.766513056835637
