This would be fine for a person who has had a drawing class and wants to be guided in other drawing, but not for a person who really wants to begin to learn to draw by starting with simple shapes.",1334188800,6,305,3.9193548387096775
8206081,5,B000SNBJCW,"I liked this DVD very much and hope to purchase the rest in the series very soon.  It is easy to understand and covers the basics.  If you work with young people, this is a great tool to help them get into drawing.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to draw.",1268524800,4,274,3.9454545454545453
