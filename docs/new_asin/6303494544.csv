Still, this was a very highbrow discussion.  I am not sure why the lecturer dressed as if she were going to a presidential inaugural ball.  You might not want to hear two hours worth of ""The Queen owned this painting and that one and the next one.""

This won't be interesting to most, but the small intended audience will love it.  Those who liked fictional productions about these queens may love this lecture as well.",1185321600,2,680,4.479674796747967
