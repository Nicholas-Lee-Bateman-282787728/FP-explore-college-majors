4214461,5,B003WVJ66S,"I think this is the perfect DVD to get kids, whether Thomas fans or not, into the Christmas mood.  It features Santa, snowmen, Christmas lights and trees, snow, and more!  The DVD is broken down into four episodes, all with Christmas themes, and are great to watch separately or all in a row.  My sons were super excited to see Bash and Dash which they first met in the DVD Misty Island Rescue.  This DVD is also narrated more than the trains talk, which I know some people prefer.  I love though the lessons my kids learn from Thomas & Friends like working together, making friends, doing your work, and more.  Overall, this really is a cute DVD for any child, but of course especially for kids that love trains or Thomas!",1287187200,16,723,4.4393939393939394
4214462,1,B003WVJ66S,"I find it very offensive that the producers of this can take our ""Christmas"" money but put the word ""Winter"" in its place. I love Thomas but won't be buying this one. How ironic that Thomas was created by a reverand. Stop the pc madness and giving into a very few atheists!!! The Amazon uk version actually says Christmas so I may buy that. Watch the preview and you will see what I mean.",1287187200,25,388,4.256756756756757
4214463,1,B003WVJ66S,"I bought this with a sticker stating ""never before seen on TV"" which was not accurate 3 out of 4 episodes have aired on PBS.

Additionally, it is a little awkward how they go out of their way to avoid using the word Christmas. Winter Holiday lights? I know we aren't all Christian, but the shows are full of Christmas trees and Santa so I doubt a Jewish or Muslim family would purchase it and be offended by the word Christmas. What a waste of money!",1419811200,,450,4.232558139534884
4214464,5,B003WVJ66S,My ten month old son likes it. That is all I need to know. The theme song comes on and he's happy.,1388880000,,98,3.5
4214465,2,B003WVJ66S,"Santa says, ""Merry Winter Holidays!"" Seriously?!?! It's cute, but give me a break. They're celebrating Christmas!!! We love Thomas, but will skip this at Christmas.",1388188800,,164,5.6
4214466,3,B003WVJ66S,"Good for young kids, but now that my son is older (1st grade), he doesn't like Thomas as much so he gave it only 3 stars.",1388102400,,121,3.6923076923076925
4214467,5,B003WVJ66S,My 4 yr old son loved this movies it puts him all in the holiday spirit. Son loves it. Great,1387238400,,92,3.65
4214468,4,B003WVJ66S,I have kids my kids like trains. I let my kids watch Thomas all the time. The one good thing about Thomas is if the kids are a little tired they will fall asleep because it is not too action packed. Its great for kids.,1385942400,,218,3.8666666666666667

4214470,3,B003WVJ66S,There was to much narrative by people and lost interest to my 1 1/2 year old who loves Thomas.... Wouldn't reccomend this video,1356739200,,127,4.565217391304348
4214471,1,B003WVJ66S,"I love Thomas however, after watching about 1/2 of the movie I turned it off.  What the heck this is Christmas not Winter vacation or Holiday!  Not worth watching.",1355097600,2,163,4.586206896551724
4214472,1,B003WVJ66S,I cannot recommend this video based on the fact that they went out of their way not to mention Christmas. It was awkward and unnecessary.,1354838400,2,137,4.52
4214473,4,B003WVJ66S,"OK...""Merry Winter Wish"" avoids saying ""Christmas,"" it's true. Although contrary to what some of the other reviewers have said, the word IS mentioned a few times, like, maybe three, tops. Personally, I find such political correctness annoying at best. I was irritated that they didn't say 'Christmas'. Then my two year old turned to me, pointed at the screen and said ""Mommy! Crit-mas! Crit-mas!"" So really? I have done my job. And as far as my son goes, it really doesn't matter whether they say the word or not. He knows it's about Christmas because he has learned about Christmas from his parents, not Thomas.",1337644800,,612,4.838095238095238
4214474,1,B003WVJ66S,"Who thought this was a good idea? These stories have nothing to do with Christmas or any other winter holiday. The last straw for me was when Sir Topham Hatt dressed up as Santa Claus and said, ""Happy Winter Holidays, everyone!"" Really? It's pretty bad when not even a Christian Saint says Merry Christmas. At least I didn't pay for it since it streamed for free with our Prime membership. From now on, I'm only letting my kids watch Thomas stories made before 2002.",1325894400,5,466,4.559523809523809
4214475,1,B003WVJ66S,"I couldn't stand watching more than 2 minutes of this movie.  It is so obvious they are trying to celebrate the religion of Atheism.  Don't bother setting up a Winter Tree, or hanging Winter Lights.  And wishing people a Merry Winter.  It is so pathetic.  You can be Atheist, but don't insult me by taking my sacred Holiday that is supposed to celebrate the Son of God's birth, and try to morph it into something generic. Christmas has already been commercialized and stolen to celebrate some fat man in a red suit.  This movie is celebrating Godlessness.",1323993600,3,555,4.670103092783505
4214476,3,B003WVJ66S,"This is a very nice DVD for children I am saving it for my son for Christmas but I have already reviewed it before he sees it I imagine he will love it.. but I think they could have been slightly more creative than having Sir Topham Hat dressed as Santa.. (couldn't they have the real Santa visit Sodor or something?)
Well overall it's a nice show my son will probably watch it over and over anyway",1322697600,,398,4.181818181818182
4214477,5,B003WVJ66S,"My daughter loves Thomas, and this is by far her favorite of all the Thomas DVDs we have. It's cute. It's harmless. Yes the lessons are a bit repetitive, but they're entertaining and not everything has to be Super Educational or adhere to a very specific belief system. Regardless of Rev. Awdrey's denomination (and he was an Anglican priest, not an American Protestant pastor), his stories aren't specifically built around a denomination-based belief system. Neither are the stories of Curious George, or Kipper, or Little Bear. They are all sweet cartoons that carry a good lesson, and are certainly not designed to cause offense through language.

There's not a thing wrong with saying Happy Winter Holidays (""Holiday"" comes from ""Holy Day"" after all), or Merry Christmas, or Happy Chanukah for that matter. Didn't Jesus teach tolerance and kindness towards others? Yes. Does this particular DVD teach lessons that directly oppose Jesus' teachings? No.

Sure, the trains misbehave at times (though not nearly as much as the older DVDs where they teased each other and used name-calling or were very rude, but happened to use the word ""Christmas"") or make mistakes/poor choices, but the end lessons are always the same -- they realize their mistakes, they feel remorse, they resolve to become as ""useful"" as they can be, and behave properly. That's a positive lesson, even if it's a bit redundant.

Here's the Thomas intro, as written by Rev. W. A. Awdry:

""Dear Christopher,
Here is your friend Thomas, the Tank Engine.
He wanted to come out of his station-yard and see the world.
These stories tell you how he did it.
I hope you will like them because you helped me to make them.
-Your Loving Daddy""

He wrote them as children's stories, as inspired by his child, not by his religious views. I think it's a bit much to look for offense when obviously none is intended. :/

So, the bottoms line: does the DVD have a negative impact upon my child? No. If it did, then sure, I'd rate it low, and wouldn't let her watch it. But it's not negative. It's cute, and it's entertaining, and letting her watch it is not going to undermine our spiritual teachings.

Pus, she absolutely loves it! So for that, and the positive lessons it teaches, this DVD rates 5 stars.

(ps. I do agree that it's annoying however that you have to fast forward through the ads. I'm not a fan of product commercials for kids, but my kids understand that commercials are people trying to sell us things, and we've taught them that just because we see it on a commercial doesn't mean we have to buy it in the store, because there are some things that aren't positive toys/shows, and they get that. It's tough at times, but they get it. And my five-year-old helps fast forward for my almost three-year-old, so they don't watch the commercials.)",1319846400,3,2815,4.742331288343558
4214478,3,B003WVJ66S,"My boys love this video (they are 4 and 2), and they know it's about Christmas, but I've make sure to explain that some people think saying ""Merry Christmas"" is offensive, which is why they're saying weird things.  I noticed that they didn't rename the Christmas Tree, but they avoided actually identifying ""Father Christmas"" (the costume Mr. Perkins wears at the end of the program), because ""Father Winter Holiday"" would sound just ""too"" ridiculous.  So, as an adult, I find the show annoyingly anti-Christian (can you imagine renaming Muslim or Jewish holidays to avoid offending non-Muslims or non-Jews?), but otherwise my boys love watching the program.",1312675200,,658,5.19811320754717
4214479,1,B003WVJ66S,"I am not exactly a holy roller, but this ""holiday"" special is a new low.  If you are not a Christian this special should still bother you.

Maybe next year the writers can come up with Thomas and Friends Saturnalia special.",1298937600,3,325,4.666666666666667
4214480,1,B003WVJ66S,"I am not much of a religious person, but I was very much annoyed and turned off by the blatant attempts to avoid mention of the word, ""Christmas,"" in the title and throughout the video features.  Come on!  Christmas may be a Christian holiday, but it is now being enjoyed by people of many different religious background; to avoid mentioning ""Christmas""-- I assume so that non-Christians viewers and would-be viewers wouldn't be turned off or somehow offended--is rather ridiculous.  ""Merry Winter Holidays?""  God, what a bunch of hipocrites!!!!  The original Thomas character was created by a Christian clergyman, for GOD'S SAKE!!!  If HIT entertainment keeps this up, I'll have to cut out Thomas from my two son's library just like I've cut off Barney from our household for being so annoying.",1296518400,4,795,5.030534351145038
4214481,2,B003WVJ66S,"My kids will watch most anything Thomas - and this is no exception.  The negatives for me was that this dvd has a big gold sticker on it that says ""never before seen on tv"".  That's a complete lie.  We have some of theses stories on our DVR from the local PBS station.  No need to buy this dvd when you can watch it for free.",1293840000,,325,3.878787878787879
4214482,1,B003WVJ66S,"I heartily agree with most comments above. Besides the usual Thomas style claptrap, the stories bend over backwards to never mention the word Christmas and it is somewhat ridiculous. My family is not particularly religious but the strain to avoid any religious conotation to a religious holiday was almost embarrasing, definitely offensive. This is definitely one to avoid. The kids sort of liked it, but it didn't keep their interest for long. I can't see myself or my kids wandering the neighborhood wishing our friends a ""Merry Winter Holiday"" instead of saying merry Christmas or happy holidays..",1291852800,10,600,5.195876288659794
4214483,1,B003WVJ66S,"Despite the author of the Thomas books being a Christian, the producers decided to attempt to sell a Christmas special without using the word Christmas once.  The title should have been a red flag.  The absence of the word Christmas is extremely obvious and awkward.  Terms like winter star, winter decoration, winter celebration, winter tree, etc, is such a slap in the face to every Christian or person who is disgusted with companies afraid of offending muslims, Jews and other religions that do not celebrate Christmas.  Most non-Christians really aren't offended by Christmas specials.
I hope Christians and non-Christians alike show the makers that idiotic decisions like this reduces sales.",1291680000,10,697,5.3090909090909095
4214484,4,B003WVJ66S,"If your looking for a ALL CHRISTMAS ALL THE TIME movie from Thomas this is not it. The movie does celebrate the ""Winter Holidays"" and included in that is Christmas. While not mentioned by name its implied, there are many holidays in winter and many children who celebrate these WINTER holidays love Thomas...why exclude any of them?! I think it was cute and my sons loved it. So if your looking for a cute holiday movie and your kids love Thomas buy it you won't be sorry and I am sure more importantly your kids won't either.

I believe the one star ratings are not rating the movie or the response from there own children but there own thoughts on what has become a ""too Politically correct (pc) world"" and even if thats true it has nothing to do with this movie. Using terms like ""I aint buying it"" just shows you should not be writing a review for anything to begin with.

Enjoy and Happy Holidays! ;)",1291075200,2,905,4.380952380952381
4214485,4,B003WVJ66S,Good movie-we all love Thomas!  Have never been disappointed with a Thomas Movie.  Love the ones where his mouth moves most!,1290816000,,124,4.857142857142857
4214486,1,B003WVJ66S,"I've come to recognize how even for a kids' show Thomas has become pretty formulaic, but I bought the disc against my better judgment. For a ""special"" (really just 4 episodes), there's really no additional thought or effort put in. Sure there's lots of great wintery-looking scenes, but all four stories are the same plot of a character being assigned a special but disregarding their instructions in an attempt to do something fun/special. Aside from some decorations, there's nothing to make these stories much more ""Christmas-y"" than any others.

Finally, the way they avoid saying ""Christmas"" is handled really tactlessly. Expressions like ""Merry Winter"" and ""Winter Holiday Party"" really stretch the willing suspension of disbelief, especially as Thomas is set in 1950s Britain and was created by an Anglican clergyman.
