7580725,5,B019QEMCTM,"Sunshine Superman is not for BASE jumpers or thrill seekers only: it is many stories wrapped into one film.  It's more than an adventure or the biography of one many, it's a love story on many levels.  Love between man and nature, man and his fellow man, and a man and a woman.  As John Long says in the movie ""they didn't fit anywhere, but they fit together.""  I think of the film in 6 chapters: Carl's early life, Yosemite part 1, Jean, Yosemite part 2, BASE, and Norway.

This is a very deep film and you must watch it more than twice to pick up on all of the action, interviews and nuances.  Listen closely to the Yosemite park ranger and reflect on Dean Potter's death.  And listen close again when the Norwegian medical examiner explains why he thought Carl was so special.

And to cap it all off, what a wonderful soundtrack!  A wonderful movie you can enjoy over and over again.",1456876800,3,886,4.353658536585366

8745800,4,B019QEMCTM,"With interviews, reenactments, and actual footage this shares the stories of a couple who became involved in B.A.S.E. Jumping which is jumping with chutes from buildings, bridges, and other objects which began in the 1970's. Much colorful footage, then law enforcement gets involved.  Later they go to Europe to set a new record for a television show.

Extras features two short jumping movies. Insightful.",1529280000,,406,5.328125
