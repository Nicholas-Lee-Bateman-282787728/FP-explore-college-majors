7918909,5,B00003ETQB,"All 3 of these films are very enjoyable, with clear picture and terrific sound. They are all short, and the time invested watching them was well-spent. They are classics of the B-movie genre; 2 with Karloff, 2 with Dick Tracy (not the same ones!), all with quick editing, rapid-fire dialogue, witty repartee and wonderful characters. Some politically correct persons may take issue with Karloff's Mr. Wong, but it's what they did back then with low-budget films. I enjoyed this trio of films immensely. PS~A lot of reviewers here got this confused with a Sherlock Holmes anthology, apparently of poor quality. Ignore  reviews about this product that refer to the Sherlock Holmes product...",1171152000,,689,5.151785714285714
7918910,4,B00003ETQB,"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce will be forever remembered as ""Hollywood's Holmes and Watson"". This DVD gift pack (one hopes the first of many) recaptures the timeless duo in four adventures.
In  ""The Woman In Green"", Holmes finds himself wrapped up in  Ripper-like murders of young London women. When he investigates a beautiful  woman who is also a master hypnotist, he finds he may end up dead. Features  Henry Daniell in a wonderful performance of Holmes' most famous nemesis,  Professor Moriarty.
""Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon""  finds Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson fighting Nazis in World War II.  Loosely based on 'The Dancing Men', Holmes must locate and reclaim the  secret plans of a devastatig weapon before the Nazis use it for their own  evil purposes. The WWII Holmes films are excellent documents of the times.  Many people don't remember the militarization of Hollywood during the 1940s  when every film had to pass the litmus test of ""How will this help us  win the war?"" Every film from an American studio was used to a degree  as propaganda to help in the war effort. The Sherlock Holmes film series  was no exception, and thus we find our beloved characters unaged in the  then present day - without explanation, but still an enjoyable  film.
Getting away from the War, we come to ""Dressed to Kill""  where Holmes finds that a music box is the key to an elaborate  counterfeiting scheme. Patricia Morrison is great in this film and Rathbone  and Bruce have their share of moments as Holmes and Watson.
Finally,  probably my favorite, ""Terror By Night"" is a great Holmes  adventure which has as much comic relief as intrigue. A murder has been  committed on a train, and Holmes must find the killer before the train  reaches it's destination. It's high adventure at high speed where Holmes  finds himself reunited with bumbling Scotland Yard Inspector Lestrade, who  has just the right amount of comic timing.
This is the first time these  movies have been available in a format that's worth watching; until  recently you could only purchase them in the low definition EP VHS format.  Plus, the discs also feature a rare interview with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,  making the set a must have for both Holmes enthusiasts and classic movie  buffs alike!",961372800,4,2273,4.84375
