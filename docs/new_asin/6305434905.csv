7889046,3,6305434905,"Having Matayoshi Sensei on tape in which to review throughout ones lifetime is worth the purchase. Matayoshi Sensei did not perform all of the kata in this series the same way as they are performed or taught in the Kodokan Dojo in Okinawa, or as they have been taped by the Kodokan Dojo. I found the productions made at the Kodokan Dojo are far superior to this series, even though all of the high tech production features are absent. Again, to me it was worth purchasing to see Matayoshi Sensei alive and well, but the quality of the tape and its short duration make it an expensive purchase for very little information, most of which is not as taught in Okinawa.
I would like to see Tsunami make an entire video series on Matayoshi Kobudo staring Yoshiaki Gakiya Sensei, who was named by Matayoshi Sensei as his successor. In such a venture, the Matayoshi kobudo system would be preserved for all time, would be demonstrated by one of the best-if not the very best living practitioner of Matayoshi Kobudo, and would be presented with Tsunami's high quality production methods.",1034294400,3,1078,4.708994708994709
7889047,5,6305434905,"The first Kobudo tape by Sensei Matayoshi was a great video, but moved too  fast and covered too many forms without much explanation.
The second  video has a huge amount of information from Sensei Matayoshi, as  translated, and really pares down to the important things regarding the  weapons he demonstrates.
This video will move anyone's kobudo up a notch,  from the beginner to the advanced.",968716800,,394,5.0
7889048,5,6305434905,"The second video by master Shimpo Matayoshi, despite the fact of being shorter, has to be considered a treasure for Kobudo students. In this one,  the master shows the basics of the metal weapons: Sai, Nunti-sai and Kama,  with a basic Kata for each one, and tell us some things about the okinawan  martial arts' history.",965088000,3,321,4.696428571428571
