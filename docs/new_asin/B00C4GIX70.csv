8577281,1,B00C4GIX70,"This video was produced terribly. Was it done on a cell phone?
There was no step by step demonstrations or explanations, just a single camera
showing Jake doing his 1 hour routine.
The audio was bad, you could barely hear what he was saying.
Very poorly done, I wish I could return it for credit or a refund, but I'm sure that's
not an option.",1382313600,2,343,4.292307692307692
8577282,5,B00C4GIX70,I am new to yoga and I really enjoyed this DVD. It is clear and easy to follow and fits in well with my weekly workout routine. I can see myself watching and practicing the routine over and over again. I have recommened this to a few of my workout friends and they have also have enjoyed using it. Highly recommended!,1367625600,4,317,4.213114754098361
