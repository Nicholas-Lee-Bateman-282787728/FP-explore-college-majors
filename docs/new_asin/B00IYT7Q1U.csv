Season 3 Episode 22 ""Terror on the Trinity"" is not included due to licensing reasons -- which is a shame. The quality of the episodes are very good, picture sharp and clear. Though it does not say but the episodes seem to have been remastered. I'm going to enjoy watching this complete series for the first time. They just don't make TV this good anymore. Gene Barry does an excellent job of playing Bat Masterson.",1452902400,3,491,4.466666666666667

8646586,4,B00IYT7Q1U,BM was my favorite Western when I was a kid. I'm glad I bought this CD collection but after watching almost all episodes I found out that some are just incomplete prints of the originals (a minority of the episodes to be honest with) they lack English subtitles which in my opinion is a disadvantage if you like to quietly watch them at night without disturbing other people.,1502409600,,375,4.529411764705882
