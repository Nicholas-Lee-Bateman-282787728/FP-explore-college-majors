2397422,5,B000AYEIDQ,"A small Spanish town invites women from other locales to help build the population. Three different relationships start to take place, and they deal with typical issues [in-laws, friends opinions, trust], all the stuff that life tries to destroy in a budding romance. This isn't a big budget movie, and when it's over YOU will appreciate it. It's actually very well done, and earns a spot in your film collection.",1318204800,2,413,4.914285714285715
2397423,5,B000AYEIDQ,"This movie is entertaining and informative. I first saw it on the screen during the Walter Reade Film Festival of Spanish Film several years ago and it stuck with me. The idea of ""caravanas de mujeres"" is not fictional and it is an interesting, albeit problematic solution to the lack of women in small isolated Spanish towns. The film depicts it dramatically, and includes the plight of two Caribbean women and the racism and difficulties they face in the attempt to assimilate into Spanish society.",1246233600,3,500,4.894117647058824
2397424,4,B000AYEIDQ,"I truly enjoyed this movie and chose it on the merit of the actor, Luis Tosar. I found the idea of this movie really different and the storyline was easy to relate; there have been a few communities in the past with a lack of females and the council had to advertise. I especially loved the story between Damian and Patricia. What I enjoyed most was the intricacies of the movie - the way the rest of the community react to the 'flowers' would be as expected in any small community; the bias and the racism (if not overt, subtle as it really is in the outside world) and the expectations of the 'flower' and the men cultivating them. It's a nice change from the norm....",1179100800,7,670,4.325396825396825
2397425,5,B000AYEIDQ,"This is a wonderful movie which offers a different view of Spain, far from Almodvar's or Amenbar's films.  I first saw it in Spain when it first came to theaters, and now I own the Region2/PAL DVD version, so I cannot offer any technical information about this Region 1 DVD.  But I love the film, as did many critics who have highlighted the good pace of the film, the story, and the performances: a good balance between experienced actors (Jos Sancho, Luis Tosar) and newcomers (Marilin Torres, Lisette Meja).

The story takes place in Santa Eulalia, a small town lost in inner Spain. The locals, concerned about the lack of females in town and the risk of the town disappearing in the future, organizes a bus trip for single women to visit and meet the bachelors in town. The film focuses on three women and their local romantic partners: Patricia, a woman from the Dominican Republic, who runs away from Madrid, where she is illegally working, to look for economic stability for her children; Marirrosi, who comes from Bilbao, has a good job as a nurse, and an independent and comfortable life, but is lonely; and later on, Milady, a young Cuban who has left Havana looking for a different world. They try to find happiness with some of the men in Santa Eulalia.  Patricia meets Damin, a shy farmer who lives with her hostile mother; Marrirosi gets involved with Alfonso, a happy horticulturalist; and Milady with Carmelo, a wealthy middle-aged builder who regularly goes to Cuba as a ""sexual tourist.""  The movie focuses on these three relationships, born out of mutual need, and the similarities and differences among the six main characters. Only one of the relationships will survive at the end.

The contrast between the highly colorful and extrovert newcomers - the flowers of the title - and the dull, dry villagers is almost extreme, and several problems soon arise from the conflict between these two groups.  The movie reflects on several of these issues: immigration, culture shock, love, injustice, racism, and materialism, among others.

This is Icar Bollan's second film as director.  She is better known for her work as an actress: more than 15 films to date, including ""El sur"" (1983) by Victor Erice, and ""Malaventura"" (1988) by Manuel Gutirrez Aragn.  For her, this movie is mostly a reflection on racism and immigration.  The film is inspired in a true story: the village of Plan (Huesca, Spain) organized a caravan of single women for the bachelors in 1985, after watching on television William Wellman's ""Westward the Women"" (1951).",1134000000,52,2556,4.893518518518518

8080720,3,B000AYEIDQ,"There is a lot of negativity towards women in this movie which slightly turned me off. However, the story is interesting and the spanish is clear. I watched the movie for a course in spanish and felt that it was a biased representation of culture but it helped to open my eyes to the possible dynamics when cultures blend.",1443398400,,322,4.47457627118644

8080723,5,B000AYEIDQ,great movie---no violence--no cars racing--just a narrative and feelings---love it. I went to an all male coolege--we had mixers--but the young ladies did not have baggage--which here creates a nice story.,1391126400,3,205,5.645161290322581
8080724,2,B000AYEIDQ,This movie was okay. The plot was not the best. English subtitles help a lot when watching. I don't know if I would recommend it.,1383696000,,129,4.2
8080725,5,B000AYEIDQ,"I rented this film for a project for my Culture of Spain class at my university. This film was very well-done. It made some very serious points about social norms and culture shock, but mostly about how women are treated. The film was very enjoyable and very interesting to write about.",1381795200,2,286,4.627450980392157
8080726,3,B000AYEIDQ,It's definitely a B film. We had to watch it for class.  It shows the perils of rural/small town life. The difficulty of relationships with women from different Latin cultures and the city.,1367107200,,189,4.7272727272727275

8080728,2,B000AYEIDQ,"It's so unfortunate that evidently you cannot turn off subtitles in Amazon instant/Prime videos, or at least not for this one; and the ones for this film are particularly intrusive -at least early on. I tried to send feedback through the indicated link, but submitting just made the window disappear without acknowledgement and I couldn't tell if my complaint or plea went through. Perhaps this instant-viewing service is only for English speakers. ;)

This is not a helpful review of a film I was looking forward to, but which I decided to stop. Yet, it may be useful input for those that don't need subtitles at all and/or prefer the option to view an uncluttered projection of the artists' original work. Thank you and I sincerely hope the rest or all of you enjoy the film on which I had gotten good reports.",1329091200,2,812,4.678321678321678
