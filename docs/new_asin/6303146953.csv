8598114,5,6303146953,"I bought this video mainly because I had it about 13 years ago and I was having a pretty bad case of nostalgia. It's pretty low budget animation.

The video has three sections: one where the kids total their saved money and calculate what they need to buy for their clubhouse, one where they visit a bank where one of the character's mom works and she explains decimal places. The last is a morality lesson about honesty where a garbage man finds a valuable object after his drop off.

This movie is like 22 years old, so I'm sure parents can find more recent material to teach kids about money.",1352246400,,595,4.4
