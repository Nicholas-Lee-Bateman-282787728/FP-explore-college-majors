1901550,4,B0000A2ZO3,When my son was ordered to go to a rehabilitation program when he was in his early teens (which I'd asked for) I could only visit on weekends for one or two hours at the facility where he spent his days.  This video was played to the adolescents and parents as a group.  It hits very close to the world our teens live in today and how what we may see as typical growing up or insignificant encounters can be extremely significant to our children.  This will make your eyes wide open!,1440028800,,483,4.228260869565218
1901551,5,B0000A2ZO3,"This is a MUST see film. I  purchased this film because it featured Randy Harrison (from
Showtime's 'Queer As Folk' series) but was rewarded with a very thought provoking production that all should see and add to their video library.",1437350400,,233,4.825
1901552,5,B0000A2ZO3,"The title of this film derives from a play performed by High School students within the framework of the movie's unfolding storyline.  The play is not only highly impactive in its own right but relates directly to particular major subjects that this film deals with: Bullying; Parental indifference and lack of support; Alienation by one's peers; Faculty and School Administrators turning a blind eye to what really goes on around them; the ridiculous continued elevation of athletics and jocks above all else in educational institutions whose main purpose should be to acquire knowledge, wisdom (hopefully), critical thinking, and a certain degree of social responsibility and maturity.  An artificial hierarchy established in schools and the lack of mutual respect also adds to a negative environment. One individual, Trevor (played to the full by Ben Foster), is the primary focus of this film and, along with one of his teachers (played by Tom Cavanagh - ""The Flash"") comprise two key pivotal roles that lead to a most dramatic and important conclusion (no ""Spoilers"" here). Randy Harrison (""Queer as Folk""),  Eric Johnson (""Smallville"", ""Flash Gordon""), and Janel Moloney each play a critical part as well. This movie dates from 2001 (2002 on the DVD) and I am sorry to report that things have only gotten worse in our schools during the past 14 years; and this applies to ALL  levels of education, from Elementary school through College. Indeed, there may be a direct correlation between the decline in American student performance and education in general and what goes on in an academic and home environment these days. The current disparity between what teachers are paid compared to Presidents and Deans and other high ranking pedagogical positions is also proving detrimental to our entire educational system.  ""Bang Bang You're Dead"" carries a universal message and is not limited to just the school that is the setting for this film. It should almost be ""required"" viewing for anyone who has any connection with education. The end credits even reveal how often and where the ""internal Play"" has been seen and performed.  And I can only say ""BRAVO""!  This is a brilliant film with considerable depth and excellent performances, and I would give it even more than 5 stars if that were possible.",1434153600,,2305,5.098143236074271
1901553,5,B0000A2ZO3,"The movie is very good. It is very realistic. It touches on the bullying crisis and high school shootings culminating in a play called Bang Bang You're Dead for Trevor's redemption. Trevor and some students were bullied by other students. The principal, some teachers and some cops carried out some investigations and the cops found a video Trevor made about the bullying crisis in his school. Prior to that his teacher assigned a project and Trevor violated their zero tolerance rule. His teacher loves him and wants to help him. There's this girl he likes and who also likes him (I don't remember her name). One night she called him when he was trying to kill himself, but he spoke to her like nothing was going on. As he tried to hang himself, the rope cut and he survived. It was a miracle. Trevor joined a gang and members of this gang were bullied. They planned to take matters into their own hands, but Trevor did a heroic deed and the gang was angry. Unfortunately, I don't remember what happened to them. Trevor was right to refuse therapy. Like he said, what's the point of opening up when what you say will be used against you? Speaking from my experiences, he is absolutely right. It's a good thing that the play worked for him. Everyone should watch this and do something to address the bullying crisis. I highly recommend it.",1425686400,,1339,4.583333333333333

1901558,4,B0000A2ZO3,"Bang Bang You're Dead is a film based on the high school production by the same name and it is easily one of the most powerful and life-changing movies I've ever seen. This film is 11 years old and talks about bullying in schools, how it's a huge problem instead of harmless fun, and how it changes students lives forever. Some students become withdrawn, others depressed, some suicidal, and in the rare cases homicidal. This film follows a bullied student, named Trevor, who is on the edge of becoming all four when his drama teachers asks him to be in the play, Bang Bang You're Dead. It is a play inspired by Columbine, that takes place inside the mind of a school shooter, who is haunted by those he killed. This leads to the main point of this film, will the teacher and play save Trevor or push him over the edge? On a personal note, I was pretty small and got bullied at school, until I hit puberty. This is the first film that was actually able to express all the emotions I've had inside of me for so long. Trevor expresses every feeling and emotion that comes along with being a victim and feeling helpless. By the end of this film, I was crying like a baby. It is honestly one of the most powerful and important films I've ever seen and I only wish that someone would have shown it to me when I was in school.",1361491200,,1320,4.284

1901573,5,B0000A2ZO3,"High school a place of prison walls and invisible  bars. A place of the walking dead,the outcast the ghost. Speaking as a person who was bullied throughout middle and high school although no doubtetley  not as bad as some others i can say this movie comes as close to the real high school experience as i have ever seen. Ben fosters performance is simply breathtaking. The scene where they watch the confiscated  video from his locker is heartbreaking. That scene alone stays with me for days after i watch it.  There is no better way to sum up what bullying really does to a person than that scene. I remember exactly what it feels like to look in the mirror and not recognize yourself anymore. And as much as i try to shake that feeling i know it never completely goes away. The rest of the cast does a terrific job as well. And the writing is great and has some very memorable parts such as when the teacher says to ben fosters character 'you should decide who you are before everyone else does' or something along those lines. The only downside to this movie to me is that they kind of chicken out at the end. I not going to ruin the ending but if a person is pushed enough they may push back and it isn't a happy ending for anyone.  But aside from that very minor detail this is a five star movie all the way. This is a movie i will watch years and years from now. Everyone should watch this movie all the way from the tormentors and those they torment as it should give them a new perspective. To the parents who may not realize just what strength it takes for there children to get through the day much less excel and make something of there life.",1346976000,,1654,4.271565495207668

1901575,5,B0000A2ZO3,"Mind the spoilers.

Every once in a while, you come across a movie that goes beyond just being a movie. It is art, perhaps. It is fictional, yes, but almost always films of this unique caliber are in some way being used as a means to very seriously comment on issues facing their country of origin and/or the world at large. ""Bang Bang You're Dead"" is just such a film.

""Bang Bang You're Dead"", adapted from a play by the same name, is about a high school student, Trevor, who is attempting to reintegrate himself into his high school after a false bomb threat he made a few months back. Needless to say, this is proving difficult. Things do not get any easier when he decides to take the leading part in a play- none other than the film's namesake. This is the first time I've seen the film adaptation of any written work include the written work in the film. As the title of this film probably confuses some, at first at least, about what kind of a movie it is, so does the play's name cause a great deal of misunderstanding. Tremendous pressure is put on the school and the teacher directing the play to stop it. Enough so that he actually gives up trying to hold practices at the school and asks the students playing parts to practice in meetings off campus.

It is at one of those practices that this film shows us what it's all about. Mr. Duncan, asking Trevor about his character, Josh, soon is speaking as if the two are, or rather could be, one and the same. Josh, obviously, in taking a gun to school and killing classmates, feels he has nothing to lose. So why hasn't Trevor done the same? What's stopped him? Mr. Duncan calls it ""X"". Maybe X is cowardice, maybe it's a sense of honor, maybe it's having someone- something- to live for. ""What if I reached into you and took out X?"" Mr. Duncan asks. Trevor says, realizing- ""I'd be Josh.""

This, I feel, is the point of ""Bang Bang You're Dead"" as much as anything is. Think about all the young men- and they are almost exclusively young men- who have taken up arms and committed such acts as Josh does in the play. Obviously there was nothing left that could stop them from going through with it. They obviously felt they had a better chance at something than by continuing to live as they'd done. But what about the ones who thought about it, maybe even planned and came just as close as those who actually went all the way, but for some reason didn't? They had X. And the others didn't.

Trevor ends up coming pretty close himself. Arrested a second time for another bomb scare, his reputation takes yet another hit and he finds himself with the Trogs, a group of social outcasts who are planning a school shooting. Having been hanging out with them for some time, Trevor films the Trogs as they make their last remarks. The next day, Trevor sees the scouts the Trogs sent in first moving about, and suddenly changes his mind. He informs Mr. Duncan of what's about to happen, and the crucial moment arrives when Duncan must decide himself- does he really believe everything he's been telling Trevor? Does he trust him as much as he's made it seem he does? Duncan apparently decides yes, evacuating the school just in time while Trevor risks his life holding the armed Trogs behind a jammed door as police rush to the school. Unsurprisingly, his reputation changes more than a little. Having both stopped the Trogs and exposed the elitist culture of the school's ""cooler"", often more athletic students, Trevor goes on to perform the role of Josh in the movie's namesake play.

Any of us that have gone to a high school in America can testify to the truth this movie contains. It has far more than a lot of us would like to admit. When confronted with the reckless, bullying cruelty that many of the school's athletes feel themselves entitled to, more than a few school administrators squirm uncomfortably. But they actually do something, give some chance for Trevor to prove himself rather than continue to make him the victim of a witch-hunt. The message there is very clear to me- there are Trevors out there. 'Bad' kids who are not truly bad. And what they become is largely up to us. Treat somebody like a monster long enough and eventually they just might decide you've got a point. Once that barrier is passed, it's just a short step towards deciding you've really got nothing to lose, and then- bang bang, you're dead. Give them a chance, though, as the school leadership in this film gives Trevor- they just might surprise you with how well they turn themselves around.

I should probably add that this film does not just tell its story from Trevor's perspective. It is primarily his story, yes, but we see at least a glimpse of how pretty much every adult and every teenager associated with Trevor in any way sees things.

That's got a lot to do with it being as good a movie as it is.

""Bang Bang You're Dead"" is a unique movie, one I am very glad I saw. It got my attention faster, and kept it better, than many far more expensive and better promoted films. It never even saw the inside of a theater, being released directly to television in 2002 and to DVD in 2004, both times with little fanfare. But believe me when I say that out of the many, many films that have come and gone in the past decade, this is one of the few that you truly owe it to yourself to see.",1317859200,,5339,4.439795918367347
1901576,5,B0000A2ZO3,Fantastic movie for any school that is looking to put on the play of 'Bang bang you're dead'. It gives an indepth view to why any child would want to shoot people. It is also great to show students what 'their' bullying does to others.,1311033600,,235,4.2444444444444445
1901577,1,B0000A2ZO3,"The point of this movie is the opposite of what it purports to be.  `Bang Bang You're Dead' was clearly designed to pollute innocent minds.  It pretends to have a morally uplifting message.  But nothing could be further from the truth.  In case you are nave about what is going on in the world; there is a network of criminals who control the media.  This network of criminals is focused on corrupting the minds of innocent children.  They are trying to create chaos in the world.  This movie, among other things, is telling children that one possible reaction to being bullied at school is to kill people.  These criminal filmmakers get away with this type of message by pretending to say, ""Killing people is a bad idea.""  In reality, the point of the film is to put the idea into the minds of children that killing people is an option.

Putting this type of imagery into the mind of a child is criminal behavior.  ""Teachers"" who are having their students watch this film should be arrested for child abuse.  Word",1307232000,,1014,4.572222222222222

This movie made me cry so hard and I don't cry easily in movies. I went to take a shower soon afterwards and cried in the shower then kept crying the more I thought about it. What an impact it made on me. My sister is 15 and she used to be a happy girl but is now very moody and it's so hard to get through to her. She doesn't trust anybody because every day she gets bullied at school. This movie struck a chord and I couldn't get a hold of myself. I had to purchase it and show it to all my family members and friends. And Ben Foster??? OMG!!!! I cannot say enough about him. His is my favorite modern day actor. He makes acting look very easy and when I watch him I don't realize it's acting....it's such a pleasure to watch. As much as I have already said I do not feel I have said enough.

1901598,5,B0000A2ZO3,"This film, based on and incorporating the play by the same name (by William Mastrosimone), is about a boy in high school who was tormented, teased, and bullied.

I got it originally because Randy Harrison is in it, and I'm a fan, but the film quickly drew me in and kept me there, even when Randy wasn't onscreen.

Mr Duncan, the dramatics teachers at Rivervale high, in an effort to help a student, Trevor, ostracised for threatening to blow up the school football team the previous year, decides to put on a (real) play called Bang Bang, You're Dead.

In (sadly but not surprisingly) typical manner, parents and administrators (over)react without having read the play.  Mr Duncan struggles to get parents to understand Trevor and his reactions, even when it seems that Trevor himself is determined to prove his teacher wrong.

The end of the film shows the students performing a part of the play (other parts are seen-in rehearsal-throughout the film) and viewers will finally understand Mr Duncan's pleas with people to read the play.

The film also underlines, near the end, flaws with 'zero-tolerance policies' but I won't say how that's done, for fear of spoilers.

The film is frankly a must-see, for parents, educators, police, psychologists, and anyone tempted to brush bullies' actions off as 'harmless' or 'a rite of passage'",1228176000,,1336,4.9375

1901610,4,B0000A2ZO3,"I was perusing through various reviews, and saw all this christian, God/Satan nonsense, so I don't know where all that rubbish is coming from, but wow, oh wow, oh wow, this was such a rush, wickedly paced, edge of your seat with your mouth on the floor, brilliantly acted, well orchestrated ensemble cast, and stellar directing. Loosely based on the stage play by William Mastrosimone, this holds it's own in a genre not entirely saturated, but where this kind of film exist on various levels. Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant' is too artsy-fartsy, and 'Zero Day', while superb, was too realistic as it's entirely shot on camcorders. Bang, Bang, Your Dead, combines all of the movies about high school dilemmas and shootings, which hit so close to home, it's terrifying.

Ben Foster (30 Days of Night, 3:10 to Yuma, Alpha Dog) plays Trevor Adams, readjusting to the first day of school after having to attend summer school because of a bomb threat the previous year. All, teachers and students alike, are suspicious of his return. Randy Harrison (Queer as Folk) plays a cunning, dark role as the leader of the outcast anarchist aptly named 'The Trogs,' and Tom Cavanagh plays the role perfect as his video/drama school teacher who believes in Trevor and sees something others would by ignorance, never see.

What really makes this movie absolutely spectacular is the way it flows so freely from one scene to another: from Trevor making his home videos, to his interaction with law enforcement and teachers, to his being picked on and bullied by those ignorant, one tracked football jocks, and his finding perhaps solace in a beautiful girl and yet he manages along the way to capture moving images of the reality of HIS existence and the brutal savagery of the sports masses and the psychological trauma of the youth that are unfortuntely the brunt of their fun. The movie touches on the important subjects of what most large, inner city and suburbian high schools go through. How their sports programs are far more important than the safety of the students, and how bullying in ALL ITS FORMS, can be tormenting to young adults, which they can carry on their whole lives. It shows every single side of the situation and that in itself is a very important element.

I must say to you in all honestly, put this on your next que or immediately purchase this, it is truly an experience which you won't soon forget!!

1901615,5,B0000A2ZO3,"Completely compelling movie... one of the few movies that actually depicts high school realistically. The bullying/teasing made me cringe but kids can be THAT cruel.

Schools tend to believe the ""normal"" kids more than the outsiders... maybe they don't want to face the truth, who knows... which is probly why some kids don't even bother reporting anything.

I could relate to Ben's character Trevor in the way he felt isolated (aside from wanting to blow up the football team).

'Bang Bang' sheds some light on how someone could feel helpless/angry/frustrated enough to want to something drastic and how being bullied plays a role in it. *I'm not condoning violence in any way though*

The play in the movie no-one in the town wants done but its a sort of therapy for Trevor, working out some of his inner demons and giving him a sense of pride and purpose I guess you could say.

He's walking a fine line in the movie, close to the tipping point... the only people who really seem to believe in him are his drama teacher and Jenny.

Everyone in the cast gives compelling performances... you really believe them in their roles and lose yourself in the story. Thats the mark of a good movie, which more often than not, hollywood can lose sight of that.

I was really impressed by Ben Foster... Trevor's a complicated guy and in the wrong hands it would've been a disaster but Ben really gets into the character, you find yourself rotting for Trevor not to go down the dark road.

I can't wait to see what else Ben does... he's sure to have a long career :)

'Bang Bang' should be shown in every school.... maybe it would help prevent some school violence and/or tragedy

This movie is a hidden gem that should be more well known... I highly recommend it :) 5 stars in my opinion",1189036800,,1778,4.562893081761007

this kind of thing. i was one of those kids who got teased in school and

at times i felt like going and shotting the people who tormented me but i

didn't, but i think every kid who's been teased should see this movie be-

cause it can show them that you don't have to go out there and kill the

people who hurt you, you can get revenge in different ways.

Infinately more personal than ""Elephant"", this movie provides insight into the mind of a kid who could be responsible for the next Columbine massacre.

It's one of those kind of movies that has something for everyone. If you're a teacher, it let's you know what runs through the mind of your students, not only as they are acting like bullies, but also as they are being bullied. If you're the parent, it helps to explain why your child has become quiet and withdrawn. And if your the kid being bullied, it not only shows there is help out there, but what happens to you if you ignore it. This movie should be required for anyone who wants to be a teacher, for anyone who is a student, or for anyone who is working with students. If this movie had been out sooner, maybe we could have avoided Columbine. This movie goes in-depth as to what occurs in the mind of a kid as he's being bullied around through the day, and I think what makes this movie good is the fact that he video tapes everything, so when he gets busted, the parents and teachers can't say ""oh, your just exagerating things, it's not really that bad"". Instead, he has proof that what may seem like a little bit at a time adds up until it is overwhelming and results in ""oh my God, how could something like this happen?"" I think that it is something that everyone should watch because it has everyone in it. Were you the teacher who didn't see what was happening? You're in it. Were you the parent that didn't understand what was happening to your child? You're in it also. Maybe you were the kid in school everybody picked on everyday, stuffed in the trashcan, locked in your locker, beat up in the bathroom, ignored because you weren't as popular, all because the crowd thought it was cool.

Wouldn't it be great if we could let every teacher, every bully, everyone who is anyone see the pain and tortue some people go through just to get an education. Whats the point. To me this film helped me realise that there is help out there, one way or another, justice will be given.

1901643,5,B0000A2ZO3,"I first saw this movie in Oct. 2002 when it premiered on Showtime with my neices. I want to start by stating that I am 47 years old and couldn't believe how much impact this movie had on all of us! I think it hit so hard (yes, I know it's been a million years since I was in high school) because so little has changed; just the outcome of school shootings has been added--unfortunately, in real life. It was like re-living my own high school days again.  The characters are so real there is someone that any viewer can identify with which pulls you in to the story.

It is sort of a play within a movie as the movie tells the story of a student playing the lead character in his school's making of a (real) play called ""Bang, Bang, You're Dead"" (which can be legally downloaded for free at [...] as the author makes it available to anyone who would like it). He, the student, himself is a student on the edge and the movie shows how he got there.

The incidents are all things that really happen now (and even happened when I was in high school which is why it was so interesting to watch).  As of the date of this review (1-12-05) Showtime is playing a shortened version of the movie. The original had a panel discussion and PSA after, which is also worth seeing.

Just for the few things they cut out of the original broadcast now that they are showing it as just another ""Showtime Original Movie"", that alone makes the DVD worth purchasing from Amazon.

So buy it from Amazon and be prepared to think after you watch it. Finally, I recommend that you watch it a couple times as there are things you will pick up after watching it again.  Then,  invite others to watch it.  I recieved it as a gift from an old friend and have shown it to 4 other people.  All have come back here to Amazon and purchased copies of their own. 4 out of 4 are pretty unusual odds but it's just that good.",1105488000,,1885,4.211111111111111

1901647,5,B0000A2ZO3,"""Bang Bang You're Dead"" is a compelling movie aired on Showtime in 2002, starring Tom Cavanagh (TV's ""Ed"") and Ben Foster (""Get Over It""). It explores the graphic truths of school bullying and violence and how it affects its victims. This film, inspired by a true story, should be watched by every parent and everyone that works in an environment with kids. Its hardcore substance will surely touch its viewers like no other. This brilliant plot takes them on a journey to what such torture can result to if nobody listens or takes action. The extremity was necessary as a reality check for certain individuals, especially the language, the violence, and the self-destruction. Through attempted suicide, anger management, loneliness, the school play that relates to what could happen, and others, the realisms remain as powerful as they should be. All events lead to an undeniable conclusion that will keep audiences talking. The performances from the actors add to the emotional stance, namely Ben Foster's career best as the troubled student Trevor. They accent the individual personalities wonderfully. ""Bang Bang You're Dead"" is a great movie for those looking for a powerful theme. Audiences will never forget this. Those wanting to learn a little more about this subject should also watch the documentary ""Bowling For Columbine"", directed by Michael Moore.

1901648,5,B0000A2ZO3,"A few years ago (2001) I played the title role of Josh in 'Bang Bang You're Dead' the play in Massachusetts at Pioneer Valley Performing Arts High School, and it was the most challenging role I have ever played and the most rewarding experience of my life, no joke. The play was so amazing and brought out my emotions, that are normally kept hidden, in ways I've never known before. I feel in the very short time that I did the show, I tapped into so many emotions that I didn't know I had. It was so utterly real, that it was frightening for me to play Josh and to become (even for a few performances) the person that he was. I never shared his feelings before or had been through what he has in high school (thank god) and I feel so fortunate for my life. The screenplay is so exciting, thought-provoking, slap-in-face realistic etc. It spoke to me and impressed me more than any other play I have ever read or played in. The very same goes for the movie. I have seen many movies in my life (some pretty amazing ones are out there, ie. Donnie Darko, my favorite) but when I saw the movie two years after my portayal of Josh, the same emotions were brought out of me like the play. The play and the film are both amazing, and though may not stand out in special-effects or cinematography, it is a mind-boggler and not in a stupid- Vanilla Sky what-the-hell-is-going-on way but in a realistic, this is really life for thousands of people out there way. I highly suggest this movie and I highly suggest that every high school should either show this movie for the student body or, more importantly, put on the play for the community. It speaks out to everyone and you'd have to be heartless to scoff at this movie. It may feel like an exaggeration of realism to people who can't relate with this character, but you have to understand from his point of view because there are so many people out there that feel just like Josh and nothing being done about it. Maybe I am being biased because I was Josh in the play and really got into who he was and how he felt, nevertheless this movie is a must-see. Truly.",1090108800,,2105,4.331645569620253

The fact that it's based on school violence drove my curiosity to see it. Unfortunatly, I was left with the same kind of feeling I'm left when watching an afternoon talk show. To be quite frank with you, I thought the play being acted out in the film was pretty corny. I kept thinking to myself that they should have cut it out but the film wouldn't have be able to survive without it. With that said, the film only raised my eyebrows once and that's at it's big anti climax ending. I also thought that the explainations given to me in the film were unnessary. Anyone whose been to high school doesn't need anyone to tell them that those particular years sucked. I also thought they should have done away with the main charcter's tendency to film everything he sees with a video camera. I've seen it before. It's done. Next. Although I've pretty much ripped this film, I'm not putting the film entirely down, I must say there were some scenes that were actually pretty compelling but that's nothing compared the rest of it that should have been re-writen/thrown onto the cutting floor.

I am an idealist, but i do understand that you cannot eradicate ""bullying"", but damn, we need to start doing something instead of just saying ""What A Shame"". This Movie nails the feelings of pain, guilt, frustration, terror, hopelessness, depression. A very Accurate portrayal of bullying, and the scars it leaves behind forever.
Where was this movie when I was in school?
It wasn't until the credits rolled and showed the actual play footage that i cried. The movie brought back all those emotions so clear, so fresh it was like i was in school again.
Please, watch this movie, then lend it out. This could be you're kid, your sibling, your friend.
Or maybe it was you.",1070841600,,994,4.653409090909091
1901662,5,B0000A2ZO3,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I'm a high school student and I know these things in this movie are real, because it almost happened at my school. I think everyone should watch it because it makes you think about how the world feels to people who don't think they can fit in and belong. There are so many people like that. I know this all too well and I like that the movie showed that people can get out of those kind of situations and hopefully change for the better.",1068940800,,486,4.072916666666667

1901664,5,B0000A2ZO3,"This is one of the best movies that I have seen. I still watch it and am blown away by how powerful this movie is.  It is realistic in a way that I never thought possible and I love the way that it is shot.  Going into this movie, I thought that the kids that were involved in school shootings were just messed up kids, after watching this movie, I can understand where they are coming from (not that it forgives it).  I do think that every teenager should see this, if not the entire movie, then the video that Ben Foster's character makes and is shown to his parents, the administration, and police.  I would give this movie 6 stars if I could, and I think that it is a movie that needs to be made more known.",1067212800,,711,4.093525179856115

1901667,5,B0000A2ZO3,Bang Bang you're dead was a powerful film expressing the every day reality that the youth of today is forced to deal with. A young group of teens that is often pushed around or ignored finally comes to grips with the reality that there life will never change and must take matters into there own hands. This highly emotional film is nothing but truth. People must look out for one another and deal with the reality that lives with in our schools. This reality doesn't have to last forever if we fight to change it.,1066435200,,514,4.421052631578948
1901668,5,B0000A2ZO3,"This movie is an awesome example of what children who get picked on actually go through. Ben Foster,trevor,plays a teen who gets picked on. He's very suicidal, and wants to harm the rest of the school as well. I can totally relate to everything he was going through. It touched my heart because i understood. To anyone out there who is planning on getting this movie, to understand it you HAVE compare to it. Most of you people are going to think it's about ""school violence"" and ""messed up kids"", but it's so much more deeper than that. Well i hope you enjoyed my review.",1060387200,,572,4.457142857142857
1901669,5,B0000A2ZO3,"I first saw ""Bang Bang You're Dead"" in one of my elective classes last year.  I saw it again when the administrators of my school decided to show it to all the juniors at the end of the school year.  This was an excellent move, and other high schools should follow suit.
The film is based on the play of the same name, which debuted at Thurston High School in 1999 and has become a hit since.
Ben Foster is absolutely chilling as Trevor Adams, a high school student who is despised by most of his peers due to a previous incident involving a home-made bomb.  Things start going right for him when he lands the leading role in the school play and becomes part of an exclusive gang.  However, Trevor's high spirits are shattered when his gang decides to ambush the school, Columbine style.
This film is nothing short of brilliant.  It conveys an urgent message that cannot be ignored.  I only hope people will take note and start trying to improve our educational system.",1057795200,,969,4.4772727272727275

After studying Columbine in considerable detail for some time, it became clear this movie was sending all the right messages about the reality of school violence and teen depression. I love the attention it draws to the impact a passionate educator can have on a single child. Definitely a must see for all teens, teachers, professors, therapists, law enforcement officers, and anyone who is passionate about encouraging peace in our schools.",1467504000,,468,5.171052631578948
