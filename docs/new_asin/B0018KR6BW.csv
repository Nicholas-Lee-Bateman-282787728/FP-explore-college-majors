8607913,1,B0018KR6BW,"When I tried to watch the movie, a notice came up ""Check Regional Code"" and would not allow me to proceed.  I emailed the company and was not satisfied with their reply at all.  It read that I should purchase a machine that reads all regional codes if I wish to view the movie or return the collection to them and pay the for the postage.  If I do that, it will cost me as much as the collection.  I believe that they should send me a return label and pay the postage themselves and explain this possibility to the customer before filling their order.  I have never come across this problem before and had no idea such requirements existed.",1392681600,3,640,4.3
