8451887,5,B0050UEVFA,"It is about time somebody re-released these true horror classics from the 90's horror empire ""Full Moon"" features, these Puppet Master movies being their big money makers from said period. Overall, the acting is good for 90s (pre-scream) horror films, but what really makes these movies is the fantastic killer dolls/puppets, which gush in plenty of blood & mayhem, another plus is the excellent special effects (by legend David Allen), and another, is that well known horror director Jeff Burr (of Leatherface: Texas chainsaw massacre 3, Stepfather 2 & Pumpkinhead 2) directs the best 2 sequels on this collection (4 & 5). Picture quality is pretty good for these films, as is audio. An overall awesome buy, for some movies which are truly hard to find on dvd, so anybody would be a fool not to buy these Puppet Master sets now that they are being brought back (also check out other Full Moon movies if your a horror/fantasy buff, try Subspecies & Demonic Toys also). 5 stars!",1345852800,,977,4.821428571428571
8451888,5,B0050UEVFA,Puppet master films rule!!!! It's great to see them back again only on DVD this time! You get alot for your money when they're packaged like this!,1330473600,,146,4.444444444444445
