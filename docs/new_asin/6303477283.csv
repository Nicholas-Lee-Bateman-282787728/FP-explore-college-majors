7848390,4,6303477283,"Brunswick is an inner suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, and attracted many of the post-war settlers who flocked to Australia, making Melbourne at one time (and possibly still) the largest 'Greek' city after Athens, and the Italian population which migrated to this originally exclusively Anglo-Saxon city was not much smaller.

It is a very well made macabre crime comedy with a fine cast of actors led by Sam Neill, one of Australia's very finest actors, though he is not as well known in the USA as his several famous countrymen and women who are in constant demand for roles n the American film industry. Australia, the country where the world's first true feature film was made, which contributes digital special effects sequences to many American films, or even entire films like the latest 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film and the 'Mad Max' series, has a thriving local film industry which makes many finely crafted and enjoyable movies. This is one of them.",1433030400,,960,4.962732919254658

He stated in some interview that he identified more with this character than any of the others he played, and that makes it even more charming. It's definitely not a waste of two hours of your life, as some of his movies are.  I will never forgive The Piano.",1355529600,,380,3.986842105263158
7848392,4,6303477283,"Very droll with witty dialogue and engrossing characters, this movie will keep you entertained all the way. The movie was shot 'on the streets' of Brunswick (a suburb of Melbourne), which was the first residence of most  migrants to Australia until the late 1970's (when the yuppies discovered  its charms). The characters are honest and charming. It shows the true  meaning of friendship.",949622400,4,389,5.142857142857143
