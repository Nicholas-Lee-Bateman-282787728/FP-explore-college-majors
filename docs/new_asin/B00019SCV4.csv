1983521,4,B00019SCV4,"This was very well done overall.  Cesar's english is perfect so you'll have no problem understanding.  I like how it has both sport and street fighting application, however I prefer the streetfighting.  It seems to be a little bit more geared to the sport.  The only bad thing is that the segments are not seperated so in order to get to a specific move you cant skip you have to fast foward.  Each DVD has 3 volumes on the main menu but they have no sceen selections and you cant skip (chapter skip) to cetain moves like most DVDs have.",1123977600,4,537,4.33
1983522,4,B00019SCV4,This DVD collection is everything I expected and then some. I'm very happy with my purchase.,1121904000,,92,4.8125
1983523,5,B00019SCV4,"Ignoring the fact that this set is divided into beginner, intermediate and advanced, the techniques are still all at the beginner level. That said, if you were to master them, you'd be well on the way in your jiu jitsu career.

And Cesar Gracie certainly provides the quality instruction you'll need.

This was one of the first sets I saw when I first started out a couple of years back. I'm glad about that because it's a great set. It assumes a little knowledge of terms, and you'll need some coaching, but this will put you up on the other white belts in your class.

Predominantly the classic basics, Cesar explains with good detail in perfect english (a real plus, in the world of BJJ videos). Cesar details techniques from a broad spectrum of circumstances and gives you a little how to in each of them.

He covers gi and no-gi and even touches on Vale Tudo and self-defence.

It doesn't offer a great deal of ""game development"" or a ""look inside my game"" approach, as is popular, today. But, it is what it is and it is one of the (if not THE) best series on the basics.",1121126400,10,1076,4.386934673366834
1983524,5,B00019SCV4,A great blend of gi and no-gi fighting for both sport BJJ and street.  Great detail in the instruction without boring you with too much repetition.  Best DVD set on the subject that I have found.,1113264000,6,195,4.388888888888889
1983525,5,B00019SCV4,"This is a top notch well organized DVD set from master trainer Cesar Gracie.

A couple things make this a special deal:

1)  The techniques cover both Gi and no-Gi.

2)  The moves flow in a logical order - it is not just a hodge podge of techniques.

3)  Many of the moves are unique, and not shown in other tape series.

4)  Cesar's English is much clearer and easier to understand than most jiu jitsu instructors.

5)  The price can't be beat.

If you want to improve your jiu jitsu game, this is a great buy.",1112054400,42,511,4.154639175257732
1983526,4,B00019SCV4,"These DVD's are very well done.  They are very simple, and with very basic knowledge of grappling/martial arts every segment can be understood with ease.  Each technique is covered from multiple angles to ensure comprehension of the steps involved.  Its only problem as far as I could see was its focus on ""sport"" jiu jitsu.  The primary difference in ""sport"" jiu jitsu is that both competitors wear a ""Gi"" (the traditional outfit for most Japanese martial arts) which is heavily relied upon in many of the techniques covered.  Practical application in self defense is covered, just not as extensively.  Though the basic knowledge of Gracie principals will more than make up for this against opponents without high level fight experience. All in all, worth every penny.  A must for anyone who wants to improve their grappling/fighting ability.",1109289600,11,843,5.109489051094891
1983527,5,B00019SCV4,This is a must have.  I have been studying BJJ for years and I pulled 5 pages of notes off of this set.  These were techniques or aspects of techniques that I did not know.  I use three techniques a night in class to practice and I received taps every time so far.,1097020800,9,264,3.943396226415094
1983558,5,B00019SCV4,"I am wanting to start doing Nogi grappling, so i purchased this dvd set to get a feel for some Jiu Jitsu, as a former wrestler i know how to get take downs, u wanted to learn how to finish someone off in this sport. the quality seems to be good so far. i actually learned how to ""clean-up"" some of my ""sloppy"" (but always acceptable before) form!",1311465600,,346,4.102941176470588
1983559,5,B00019SCV4,This dvd is wonderful for when you need to go over the techniques or refresh your memory.its also good for beginners who want to memorize the basics and strategy .If you are a visual learner you will greatly benefit by this dvd .,1278806400,,229,4.348837209302325
1983560,3,B00019SCV4,"This is an excellent series, and I would recommend it to anyone beginning jiu-jitsu.  The examples are clear and shown from many angles, and there is enough variation of technique to keep you interested.

So why give it 3 stars if it is so good?  Even though these videos are very good, they do not compare to the Roy Dean Blue Belt Requirements series, and of the two, I would highly recommend the Roy Dean series over these, so that is why I gave it 3 stars.",1265587200,8,460,4.264367816091954
1983561,5,B00019SCV4,"I have been studying martial arts on and off for years. I recetly have had the opportunity to start studying Gracie Style Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I wanted to get some additional materials to assist me in digetsting the information provided in the dojo, and I stumbled upon this DVD. Listen.. Cesar Gracie is a awesome teacher.

1. He is easy on the ears :) His english is great no accent whatsoever and he gives great analogies

2. In many cases he demonstrates moves from a variety of angles

3. The DVD is broken up into different skill levels. Within just a half our of watching the basic DVD helped to shed new light on many of the techniques that have been presented to me in class.

Bottom Line is that this is worth every penny. In fact if I had seen a few of the lessons I would probably have paid double for it. Please keep in mind that I am writing this review as a beginner so I cant speak to the inetermediate and advanced DVD's included with the set. Lastly I would like to repeat that I am using this as a suppliment to in class training.",1238025600,6,1049,4.256281407035176

1983564,5,B00019SCV4,"I think It is very good instructional video.
Not slow at all.
 It make sense to go over and over because they show different angles and also mistakes you can make during training.
I take classes but this DVD shows much more deep techniques and it is very detail.

1983565,4,B00019SCV4,the video is great- this instructional video is at the perfect pace- and is very accurate in its moves,1198886400,,102,4.421052631578948
1983566,5,B00019SCV4,"I have several other BJJ DVD's and so far this is the best one. It is straight forward, clearly demonstrated from several angles, well spoken and kept simple. I found it easy to follow because it was very matter of fact, methodical and broken down very well. There is no irrelevant rambling or waffling on, just great technique expertly demonstrated one after the other. Very to the point, no fluff or BS.
You get a bit sick of him saying ""boom!"" everytime a technique is applied, but it does emphasize the effectiveness of the technique and after a while it grows on you.
When I bought it I did not realise it had three DVD's in it, gotta love the value!
I would recomend this over the others definatley.",1198195200,2,705,4.4728682170542635
1983567,4,B00019SCV4,"I bought both this and the Ultimate Winning Techniques video (see my review).  This video is awesome, but it is so ""drawn out"" I almost fall asleep watching it.  I have only made it through the first video.  They talk too much and go over and over the same moves to the point it gets boring.  I have a rewind button...I don't need every little detail done over and over 5 times!  The videos are excellent, you will learn what you need to learn from the best school in the world, but I think for a beginner you may just rather spend the $17 and get the other video I purchased.  If my point of view changes if I ever have the patience to get through the 2nd and 3rd DVD's, I'll let you know!",1193702400,3,690,4.074074074074074
1983588,4,B00019SCV4,"The three DVD's are organized by level of instruction - beginner, intermediate, and advanced techniques.  Cesar Gracie is a very good teacher and explains the techniques in great detail.

I am currently a student of BJJ myself and find this DVD set a good companion to lessons from my academy.",1171929600,,293,4.84
1983589,5,B00019SCV4,The Videos are very good. There is alot of material on the three DVD's and they are presented in a well organized and thought out format.

1983590,5,B00019SCV4,"Why would you learn ground fighting from anyone other than the family that invented it?

I wrestled in HS, fought many bare knuckle fights, and have recently (8 months back) gotten into jiu-jitsu and kickboxing. Just as most would, I've tried to get an edge on my learning curve by purchasing gym mats to train at home (as well as training in the mma academy), and various BJJ instructional DVDs.

The DVD sets I've purchased are: Marcelo Garcia (Series 2), Saulo Ribeiro (BJJ Revolution series), Mario Sperry (Vale Tudo series 1, 2, & 3), and this Cesar Gracie set. I've had a chance to compare the different styles, techniques, and educational approaches. What I've found is that each of these DVD sets is of great value because you can pick up something from each one to improve your game. Based on my experience here are the things I liked and did not like about the Gracie DVD set.

Things I liked:
1) Cesar Gracie explains the moves well
2) He goes over the moves several times for reinforcement
3) He also focuses on key details for the particular move to work
4) He explains how the opponent would react and what variations you could apply
5) The DVD production is pretty good: good lighting and the mats create good contrast to view the demonstrations
6) Nice mix of ground and stand up techniques: sport and street
7) Basics are the Key!
8) Great value for your money!!!

Things I did not like:
1) The organization of the lessons. The beginners DVD is designed for someone who's had at least 3 to 6 months of BJJ. No instructional DVD out there seems to go into much detail of the basic positions, goals of BJJ, energy conservation & breathing, position & exercise drills, balance & body sensitivity, faking/setting-up, and learning to think several moves in advance.
2) On some of the lessons I felt like Cesar Gracie was a bit too quick
3) This DVD is a bit outdated but still very good material.

Conclusion: I am very pleased with this purchase.",1144108800,41,1959,4.585714285714285
1983591,5,B00019SCV4,"This is a great product. I am recently a new fan to the UFC, and have begun to take notice of the power of ju-jitsu, i bought this tape as an enthusiast to the sport and its has given me great insight. Cesar speaks very good english and explains the moves very clearly step by step. He will show you how to do the move from several different angels, and is very good at explaing what you should be doing at a given time during the move. My only complaint is i would have like to seen a better scence selection. Currently each dvd is spli tinto 3 parts, with each part containing several moves... it would have been nice to be able to choose exactly which move you want to review, without having to fast forward through the parts. I give this dvd a 9 out of 10",1142812800,4,759,4.100671140939597
1983592,5,B00019SCV4,"Being a student of Jiu-jitsu I can tell you that Cesar Gracie knows what he is talking about. This DVD set helped me perfect moves that I thought I already knew. Also I was impressed with the amount of information in this set. For the price, it's defiantly worth it. Cesar is big on technique so the dvds are a little slow paced at times.",1140825600,2,338,4.2153846153846155
1983593,5,B00019SCV4,"I don't know Brazilian jiu jitsu, (due to there being no place to learn in my area),  I've had an interest in it for the past few months from watching UFC,  so I thought I'd buy this DVD to see what its all about, and its a great set.

I know its always better to learn from a teacher instead of a video,  but you can pick up quite a bit of info on these discs,  Cesar Gracie does a great job demonstrating the moves, he makes them very easy to follow and shows you what to do and what not to do on each move,  and it's not cheesy like some older martial arts videos I've seen.

I've been practicing the moves with a couple of buddies in my dining room and they actually work, its pretty cool,(except for the carpet burns).  I know I'd get tapped out in a second by 99% of white belts who actually take classes but I've only had the DVDs for 2 weeks.  Its pretty fun, I've gotten to the point where I can spot out and pull off some chokes, armbars, sweeps, and takedowns when wrestling around with my buddies,  so you know, you will pick up some stuff from the videos, if you sit down and practice everything on the DVDs you could do all of the moves, thats how easy Cesar Gracie makes it to understand the moves.

There are moves for sport (with gi) and street (w/o gi), for most people like me, some of the ""sport"" moves you can't do unless you happen to have a gi laying around or you practice on someone with a coat on or something,  but most of the moves you could do with or without a gi.

I don't know what someone who knows BJJ would think of the videos aside from the other reviews written on here,  but for the average person like me who would like to learn some stuff, and has no other way,  I would highly recommend this, its really well presented.  I'm not trying to say these moves are easy to do, because most of them aren't theres a lot of thinking involved in these moves,  but they ARE easy to learn how to do,  I can't stress enough on how good of a job Cesar Gracie does explaing the moves.",1135728000,11,2010,4.058375634517766
1983594,4,B00019SCV4,"These DVDs are great. My previous set of videos in my collection was the Gracie Jiu-jitsu videos done by Rorion and Royce Gracie. After watching this series by Cesar Gracie, I was able to learn many additional moves. This series covers many moves not shown in the Rorion Gracie series, and vice versa. This makes me feel that this series serves as a good addition to what I saw before, rather than being a complete library of jiu-jitsu moves (probably no DVD series can do that, but I have yet to watch the Kukuk A-Z 11 DVD set or the Froes BJJ 11 DVD set :p).

Just additional thoughts here and there:

-I was expecting some more emphasis on no-gi street grappling, but I was still satisfied with what was shown.

-I was surprised that he demonstrated many sweeps from the guard, which I happen to like very much.

-The price is reasonable for the amount of materials shown.

This set is a great addition to any jiu-jitsu library.",1134691200,8,931,4.485207100591716

1983597,5,B00019SCV4,"During my first 5 days of BJJ lessons, the instructor would show the whole class certain moves and we would practice it with a partner.  When it came down to ""rolling"" during my first few lessons, I didn't know what to do.  I kept getting tapped out or choked while in the guard and didn't have any moves to apply or really know what I was doing or how to defend. I didn't have any GAME.  After watching the video it dawned on me.  This video tighten my GAME and I am no longer being used as a training dummy.  Suddenly I'm a challenge to the Advanced Players, I'm not that easy to tap out anymore.  Thanks to this video! What I really like about this Video is that Cesar Gracie goes over the moves in different angles and explains in great detail on how to execute, and apply the techniques correctly and the reason behind each move.
