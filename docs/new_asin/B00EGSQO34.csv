8605197,5,B00EGSQO34,"Great for coaches of all capabilities.  Coach Locker is a veteran of the sport combined with a strong education background.  I've coached 15-18 year olds and started coaching 4 year olds.  My kids love practice and just enjoy being around the game while learning.  While we do have games, our team focuses on the other aspects of the game.  I highly recommend his videos and his soccer complexes are great places to learn with him and his staff.  As a side note, Coach Locker is just a nice guy...while it doesn't matter for all to know, it just makes it that much better.",1381449600,,572,4.504854368932039
