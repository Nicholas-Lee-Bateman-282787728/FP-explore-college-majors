8228607,3,B000XJM7V8,Itay Gil is a hard core Krav Maga expert.  His style of teaching in the DVD's is no non sense.  He doesn't sugar coat anything.  this DVD set is for those of like mind.,1404432000,,168,3.8823529411764706
8228608,2,B000XJM7V8,Pretty much you're standard DVD of Krav Maga. You are shown a few moves over and over. Just the basics. You can learn from them but you have to have a partner to work with.,1294876800,,172,3.942857142857143
8228609,2,B000XJM7V8,"I have yet to view the second DVD but if the techniques it contains are anything like those on DVD #1 you should be warned that they are FAR from being of any practical use in a self defense situation unless you have many years of experience and a great deal of training in the martial arts.  Many of the techniques are based upon you responding to the assailant AFTER he has launched his attack.  In other words, you have to recognize you're being attacked, correctly identify the weapon or strike is being used and exactly where it is originating from as well as the intended target on your body the attacker is aiming for, THEN you have to react quick enough to beat him to the punch (pun definitely intended) and intercept and deflect his strike in some very precise ways.  Quite honestly, a person with little or no training or even someone who has some modest background in a martial art form is not going to be able to pull this off more than once in a hundred or more attempts and those aren't good odds to be risking your life on.  I have 35 years of training behind me and have fought in the ring and I would guess that with the split second timing required and the precise placement of the hands relative to an attacker's body, I might be able to perform many of these techniques successfully in a street situation two or three times out of five tries and then only if I spend much time consistently drilling and practicing to use them.  If you're less experienced than I am, good luck with it.  It's just not going to happen.  If you're very, very experienced and train frequently then there may be something here of practical use for you.

Another weak point is that this instructor relies heavily on variations of a technique in which he steps obliquely to the side and slightly behind the attacker as the assault is being launched (again, requiring exquisite timing,) and pulls the attacker's head backwards and down, throwing him brutally to the ground.  Despite the fact that the instructor comments that the size of your attacker ""doesn't matter"" and that regardless of how big or strong he is he's ""going down"", this simply isn't the case.  It's a matter of basic physics.  To get the force to pull an attacker down with that kind of devastating power requires a specific degree of leverage which is in part dependent upon the angle at which one is pulling the attacker's head down and backwards.  If your attacker is shorter than or equal to your own height, or perhaps even an inch taller, that angle is achievable.  But more than that and the required point of leverage is entirely lost.  You would achieve nothing more than causing him at most to take a step backwards bringing his body up against your own but not in breaking his center of gravity such that he is slammed to the ground.  This is just one technique but its one the instructor uses a lot and it will not work without significant modifications on a larger opponent.  Sadly, the instructor offers no suggested modifications.  And you'll note that his students on whom he demonstrates are all smaller than he is.  That is not a coincidence.

The sections on knife and gun defense were also not all that impressive.  He totally fails to mention that when you use the sorts of disarming techniques he advocates, 99 times out of 100 the attacker's gun is going to go off.  Many of his techniques involve you holding on to the barrel of the gun as part of the disarm.  Hopefully in that split second you had to grab at the gun you don't get your hands around the muzzle or you're going to lose a few fingers.  Similarly with the knife defenses, he requires you to be grabbing at a knife that is being jammed straight at you as fast as the attacker can stab, and he expects you will be precise in grabbing exactly on to the attacker's wrist in a very specific way.  Heaven help you if your timing is even a fraction of a second off because you could just as easily grab hold of the blade of that moving knife.  Also weak was that all the knife defenses dealt with straight stabbing motions in which the attacker stabs, misses, then leaves his fully extended arm out there for you to lock onto and counter attack.  This just isn't how a knife attack usually happens. Most attackers instinctively use arcing, slashing cuts from mid range or further away and don't even think about stabbing straight at you until they have moved inside arms' reach.  However nothing in this video dealt with defense of a slashing attack.

Overall I was unimpressed with most of the video contents.  In a presentation that purports to give you street defense techniques the instructor should have focused his attention on first, how to assess threat levels so that you absolutely know when you need to go on the offensive to protect yourself, how to move in such a way so that it causes your would-be attacker to hesitate and be uncertain exactly what you're about to do, and then he should have stuck to exploiting just a few very vulnerable targets that are effective regardless of the size or strength of an attacker, like the eyes and the throat.  Fancy sidestep moves so that you can throw down the attacker from behind or one-in-a-million chance techniques that involve flawless timing and perfect hand placement are not practical or necessary for street defense.",1271635200,6,5329,4.561385099685205
8228610,1,B000XJM7V8,"OK another Moni offering. As usual visually stunning, well produced and attractive to watch. Here'es the rub. It is NOT Krav Maga, its Monis own system and its NOT taught to the Israeli military. I believe Moni has now retracted these claims but these are what sells the DVD..

That is important to understand because if you think you are buying a military combatives DVD or a Krav Maga DVD you are not. If you are looking for some interesting techniques that Moni has adapted from other systems then this could be an interesting buy.",1214870400,12,534,4.621052631578947
8228611,4,B000XJM7V8,"Great production, easy to learn and use. Brutal, simple and effective. Can't go wrong with this guy, what you learn(providing you DO learn it) may save your life.",1214611200,,162,4.821428571428571
8228612,5,B000XJM7V8,"I saw Moni on an episode of Human Weapon--on the History Channel,and knew he was someone with knowledge that I would like to add to my own practice of the martial arts. I think the video is excellent--I just feel bad for the assistant being used in the demonstrations! But, do recommend buying Moni's videos--they are very practical.",1214524800,,333,4.758620689655173
