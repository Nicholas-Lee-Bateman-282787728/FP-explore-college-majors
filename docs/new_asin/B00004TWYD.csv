They both loved the movie very much and wanted me to try to find it to buy.  Jason Timberlake was surprisingly good  in the movie.  Usually when a singer crosses over to acting, it is not a  good transition.  However, he did a great job.  Although the star/best  acting job had to be the girl that played the dual role of Alex/Janie.  The  movie reminded me of a Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen movie (Two of a Kind),  which was also an excellent show).",963964800,2,553,4.113207547169812
7923205,5,B00004TWYD,"Sorry, 'N Sync fans, but Justin Timberlake really cannot act! This movie is about two girls (who look exactly alike) named Alex and Janie. Janie is a fabulous, rich, famous supermodel and Alex is a smart, regular high  school student. The two of them accidentally meet at Alex's father's  restaurant where Janie is making a special apperance. They discover that  they look exactly alike and both decide to switch places because they want  changes in their lives. So Alex takes the place of Janie and Janie takes  the place of Alex. Suddenly things start getting messed up when Jason (a  male supermodel) asks Alex out on a date thinking that she is Janie. Then  Eric (a boy at Alex's school) asks Janie out on a date thinking that she is  Alex. When it's getting time for Alex's school dance, they realize that  it's time for them to change back but make an even bigger mistake because  Eric finds Alex talking to Jason and he thinks Alex is cheating on him so  he ends up taking Alex's worst enemy to the dance!
Kathie Lee Gilford and  Justin Timberlake star in this good, enjoyable 'Wonderful World of Disney'  original movie. It's exciting to see how the movie ends. If you've seen  this movie on the 'Wonderful World of Disney' (and if you liked this movie)  then you should buy it. It's worth seeing!",963446400,,1305,4.588744588744588
