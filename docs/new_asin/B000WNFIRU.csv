2987743,4,B000WNFIRU,"British thriller writer Len Deighton started writing the Harry Palmer books back in the 60s during the ""spy boom"" initiated by Ian Fleming and John Le Carre.  Harry Palmer was sometimes called the ""thinking man's James Bond,"" based on the way Michael Caine tipped a pair of plain brown National Health specs across his nose to make him look more intellectual.  Also the plots of the novels sometimes aspired to achieve the kind of complexity and moodiness of Le Carre's, with cheating wives, duplicitous bosses, the planting of double and triple agents, and the legacy of long-ago sins that come back to haunt our hero on present life.

Caine was more of a party boy than the books' Harry Palmer but he gave the first films their energy.  Women were drawn to him including the incredible Eva Renzi and the tragic Francoise Dorleac.  That said, no one was really that upset when, after three movies, Caine quit the role even though he had two more movies to film under his contract with Saltzsman.  The three films (FUNERAL IN BERLIN, THE IPCRESS FILE, and BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN) had done okay, but it was clear that they were not in the same running as the Bond films as far as a potential franchise went.

Finally, in the 1990s, during a lull in Caine's career, he made the final two pictures about Harry Palmer, and nobody even noticed.  Actually it might be more profitable to think of them as good Jason Connery vehicles, for Connery Jr. appears in both, claiming to have had a Dad in British intelligence (!!!) but playing Russian, and he's terrific in the part, menacing, sexy, and giving off showers of sparks every time he's on screen.  (In the first one he's joined by Mia Sara, whom he married.)  In MIDNIGHT IN ST. PETERSBURG, we feel the weight of the whole Cold War collapsing into an unruly capitalism as Caine, looking gaunt and ghastly, even in the comforting 3/4 raincoat Harry never leaves home without, stumbles around the former Leningrad searching for a plot.  The movie comes and goes in bits and pieces, as though every scene was filmed without recourse to a proper script and the actors were just winging it on the fly, with lots of Russian flags flapping around them, but you wonder if they ever went to Russia or were they just in the studio.  That said, it's a fabulously entertaining movie with great lashings of high style, fun, and espionage double crosses.  Jason Connery, in his Russian chav avatar, will curdle your borscht and put hair on your chest.",1126742400,,2483,4.680459770114942

8224399,3,B000WNFIRU,"Review of Midnight in Saint Petersburg
Hot Toasty Rag, November 27, 2017

After youve watched Bullet to Beijing, in which Michael Caine plays the famous fictional spy Harry Palmer, go out and rent the sequel Midnight in Saint Petersburg. Technically, you can watch this one by itself, but it starts up when the other ended, and so the ending of the first movie would be spoiled.

Once again, Michael Caine finds himself mixed up with bad guys in Russia. Hes trying to stop them from acquiring plutonium, and together with Jason Connerywhos just as adorable and endearing as he was in the first filmthey head back to Saint Petersburg to save the world! One of my favorite scenes is when Michael finds a bomb in his office. He throws it out of the window, but a dog picks it up and starts running around with it. Michael and his Russian colleagues are shouting at the dog in different languages, trying to get him to drop the bomb, but he runs down an alley seconds before the explosion. Everyone is pretty depressedand so is the audienceuntil the dog trots out of the alley, unscathed! Very tense, but with a happy ending.

I liked these later Harry Palmer movies because they're pretty light and fun, without a lot of heavy drama or complicated plot points. Check them out for an afternoon marathon!",1511740800,,1299,4.639130434782609

The only redeeming quality was the location but even that appeared to have been shot in studios or in the states at times.  From the acting, to the writing to the direction this was a poor film.  Harry Palmer ""jumped the shark"" with this movie.  It really wasn't watchable but I pressed on since I like the series and paid to have it sent to me.",1467504000,,406,4.10126582278481
