6268205,1,B00IK5JIGY,"This movie made no sense. It was riddled with bad acting and major plotholes. One major one is the fact these two people (it turns out there was 2) who kidnap people somehow knew the women were pregnant. How? That makes no sense and leaves more questions that answers.

This screenplay must have just been a rough draft and they went with it anyways.",1408752000,4,350,4.46875

6268210,1,B00IK5JIGY,"This movie isn't really worth the time and effort to write a review except to warn others who might be soooo bored that they go against their better judgement and give this one a try.
The story (I use that term loosely) is about kidnappings, murder, abuse and corruption of (the *&#%$) from what I could make of it.
The writing, acting, plot/storyline are consistently BAD ACROSS THE BOARD and if that wasn't bad enough the dialogue was just abominable. The only good part of this movie was some really nice camera work (angles and shot choices). I kept wanting to stop watching, but I held out a glimmer of hope that it might get better as it played. Well sorry to say it never got any better or easier to watch.",1407715200,5,713,4.409090909090909
6268211,2,B00IK5JIGY,So Bad.  Bad acting.  Terrible Premise.  Can't figure out why anyone would have read the screenplay and thought it was a good idea.  I'm surprised it has 4 stars on IMDB.  Must be from family and friends.,1407628800,3,204,4.405405405405405
6268212,1,B00IK5JIGY,"Nicole Novak (Monica Engesser) escaped her kidnapper and has gone from bad actor to bad story teller. She sits at the police station and tell a story about the kidnapper. The cops believe it has something to do with 666 and the birth of the anti-Christ. Her story telling is bad and the conversations she has with the other prisoners prove boring.

6268217,3,B00IK5JIGY,This was an ok horror film with a predictable plot. After about 20 minutes I knew who was involved in the killings. Rent this movie if you must see it do t buy it.,1412294400,,163,3.823529411764706

6268219,2,B00IK5JIGY,started out to be a decent horror movie. Then it got twisted around a bit. I am not sure if they thought adding in that twist would make it a better film. Sadly it went down hill from there.,1410307200,2,190,3.8974358974358974
6268220,3,B00IK5JIGY,Pretty well done. Actors were believable. Storyline has been done before. This one didn't really add anything new or exciting to this genre but it was enjoyable. I liked it well enough to watch it all the way through. The ending didn't make a lot of sense.,1409270400,,256,4.468085106382978
6268221,1,B00IK5JIGY,"I never write reviews, so heed my warning. this movie is written by a Sunday School drop-out, and attempts to weave a story centered on kidnapping, serial killings, bondage, God and the Apocalypse. I give it one star because it at least they didn't resort to the Zombie card to save the investors losses, but then again....it's always easy  when you are spending other peoples' money.",1409184000,4,384,4.818181818181818
8642863,4,B00IK5JIGY,"People on here might think I'm crazy but I caught on pretty early as to what some of this was about. I went back a couple of times to recheck some things because it was making me think pretty hard about a few things that bugged the hell out of me. I wasn't surprised at the end but, I was surprised enough that it intrigued me and made me think about it a lot. Most of the acting was pretty bad but, some was quite good actually. She needs to work on the tears though lol. It kept my interest to the end so that tells me it isn't too bad. I have seen sooooo many movies like this on here that were sooo much worse, it was nice to actually find a movie that made me use my brain and not be totally stupid lol. I can see myself sitting around with my daughter watching this,laughing at some of the lines..lol. Something to do and talk about without getting bored.",1519171200,,861,4.04093567251462
8642864,1,B00IK5JIGY,"Dear, dear, dear. I really don't know where to begin.

1. Interesting concept...but they are plotholes.
2. Acting could have been a bit better. Not like stellar but more in tune with the characters that they were portraying & make them a bit more real. I couldn't connect with the characters.
3. Trying to weave good vs. evil, the Devil vs. God, and the coming of the apocalypse is complex and can be done. This movie fails to do that. It kinda felt like it was just slapped together.",1488067200,,484,4.438202247191011

8642868,1,B00IK5JIGY,"I don't know where to start, the acting wasn't completely terrible, but the writing was such a mess. It felt like someone was trying to shove religion at you.
So a group of people are kidnapped, and they all start talking about the horrible things they did in life,and i guess try to make some kind of peace with themselves, or something. One story is horribly messed up with the detail of rape, they could have implied it, instead it went into some detail that was highly unnecessary. With a plot as bad as it was, and characters kind of being killed at random, it was boring. It wasn't overly gory, it didn't read like a standard horror movie and the rape scene was just, so unnecessary, if it had to do with the killer, then i would understand but since this was one of the victims it just didn't need detail.

Every single tie in to the captives seems to have plot holes all over the place and the ending has you massively sighing and regretting the time wasted watching this. However! for the person who made this, i forget their name, they wrote, directed and i think edited this. i would suggest to not edit your own films, you need an extra set of eyes to help point out what is needed and what isn't.  It could have been halfway decent with better editing and less obvious undertones.",1462233600,,1293,4.383333333333334
