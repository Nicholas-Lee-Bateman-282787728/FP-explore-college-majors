7836160,3,6303057128,"Well, since this movie was made back in the day, it was alright for that time, but now noone would think so.  The actors did a good job, but there could have been more to the movie.  After watching it, it felt just like another Saturday afternoon movie.  If there were more drama and action and more to the story it probably would have made it to DVD.  I love Michael Madsen and I think he is a cool actor so this is what prompted me to buy this movie.",1224892800,,452,3.988888888888889
7836161,1,6303057128,"I saw this movie under its UK title Final Combination but whatever you choose to call it this is a pretty sad and sorry piece of work that reflects no credit on anyone involved in its production .

It is set in LA and revolves around the hunt for a serial killer lead by womanising cop Michael Masden .The killer is identified early in proceedings -he is an Englishman ,an ex Royal Navy boxer ignominiously discharged for rape .He takes a number of aliases all the real names of prominent boxers and as part of his modus operandi calls a sex line just before killing his female victims .The cop is helped in the search by the sister of a former victim .

The story unfolds in a predictable way and is marred by a major piece of stupidity -having once escaped ,the killer ,instead of trying to get clean away ,returns to confront the cop once more .

The regulation shootouts and car chases are present and correct but staged with little elan or flair but what really drags the movie down is some shoddy acting .Masden seems incapable of mediocrity -his performance vary from exceptional to dreadful and this is a poor performance ,deeply uncharisnmatic and dull. Bonet is as ever awful and Gary Stretch (a former British welterweight boxing champion )quite simply cannot act .

Tawdry and unexciting ,this is a movie to avoid .",1106870400,,1327,4.563025210084033
