8611666,5,B00F1ZZIAG,"Samia Gamal and Farid Al-Atrasche are wonderful in this.  In addition to some very funny waiter sketches with Ismail Yassin and others, there is a final dance scene that is wonderful and unforgettable.  The Arabic translations are accurate and appreciated, as I am not a master of the Egyptian dialect. Highly Recommended!",1414195200,,322,5.173076923076923
