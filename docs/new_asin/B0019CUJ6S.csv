It is an attempt to clean up the plate of the Red Brigades in Italy by making them CIA agents. It is an attempt to clean up their crimes by making these a result of Yalta and indispensable actions to prevent the arrival of the Communists in the Italian government. It is well done but it is gross manure.

The assassination of Aldo Moro was the blocking element on the road to power for the Italian Communists, but that had nothing to do with the CIA and Yalta. It was essentially a successful attempt at preventing Communists from having any influence in the political world of Italy which would have isolated and even neutralized the Red Brigades and other Trotskyite groups.

The presence of Communists in the French government in the 80s was of no importance because they were second to the Socialists and the Socialists had been vastly infiltrated by Trotskyites and the Socialists were going to eat up the Communists like so many snails cooked in some juicy red tomato sauce. Quite different was Italy since the Communists were going to be in the government with the Christian Democrats and as the main party in Italy, not a second declining force.

The Trotskyites would have been completely neutralized and annihilated. Later on they will even practically cooperate with the extreme fascist right to eliminate the general secretary of the Communist party to get rid of the danger. For the Trotskyites, and for the Anarchists as well, and even for the extreme fascists, the world has to remain brutal, capitalistically egoistic so that these extreme forces can go on criticizing this world and appearing as justified in their criticism. Why do you think Mitterrand protected them and accepted them in France in order for them to escape Italian justice?
