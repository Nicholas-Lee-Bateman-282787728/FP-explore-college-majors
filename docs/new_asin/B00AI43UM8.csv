8551853,3,B00AI43UM8,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.

One of my favorite workout instructors and enjoyed the first volume a lot.

Pros:  Instructor still very likeable, cues well, never annoying.  Background crew also friendly without being annoying.  Moves are rather unusual/innovative hybrid moves that are a slight change from other weight workouts.  Music has a clear beat to follow, preferable to bongos.

Cons:  Overall production values are not as good as previous videos.  Camera work seemed a tad sketchy and unfocused.  Sound was also somewhat sketchy since it was rather hard to hear her speak above the music.  Neon green 80s lights against brick wall background were somewhat cheesy and distracting rather than interesting.  Music goes in both pro and con section --- was sort of techno/zumba themed which I don't care for much although others may like it.  While the moves were good, repeating them on one side than the other for a minute each was more than enough.  Repeating them again for another faster round with slight modifications, the time started to drag a little.

Overall, not a keeper for me although I would continue to be interested in other workouts by a great instructor.",1373500800,5,1214,5.0606060606060606
8551854,5,B00AI43UM8,"This is a really great workout dvd. I'm an advanced intermediate weight lifter. I bought the first volume of Atletica a couple of years ago and it was impressive. Volume 2 does not disappoint. I weight train 4 days per week and I was looking for something to use as cardio on my non-training days. Volume 2 fits the bill perfectly. Lots of repetitions of athletic movements. This provided a tough, fun and challenging workout. This one is going into my rotation once a week. I don't think I can handle doing this workout more than twice per week. It is very intense.",1365984000,7,566,4.504854368932039
