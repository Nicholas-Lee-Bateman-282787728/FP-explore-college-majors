1864942,4,B00008WJBO,"It beat my expectations I can say that much. Actually I thought it was really good while I was watching it, I was very interested in the story line and how it would end. BUT unfortunately they go ahead and ruin it with basically no ending. You are left with too many questions. It just leaves you hanging, which would be fine if they were planning on making a sequel, but we know that's not happening. So I have it at 4 stars, I took a star off because of the ending.",1084665600,6,467,4.086956521739131
1864943,5,B00008WJBO,"I Love Adrian Paul and I believe that he is beneath his acting ability in the choices he is making in the movie choices he is making. I have followed him since his fancy role as Highlander in the 90's  ms. Pope is also a wonderful actress I have seen her work before on tv and in small parts in movies and think they should both reach higher, but they gave this movie the credability it needed and kept me on the edge of my seat. I searched every where to find out about this story since at the end they gave a record of everyones outcome I believed it was a TRUE story laugh if you like but desperate people do desperate things and I was obsessed with finding out if this story was true or not... needless to say I couldn't find anything to verify the story, but that is how much it got to me, and I know the abrutness annoyed alot of people, but that is what really got to me the most because that is life folks, things don't drag out till you get your happy ending all the time do they, the car hits a tree, the fire burns out of control, someone hits your cat.  it's over. Period.  And I think that is why we were all so shook up and left so mouth hanging open and stunned by the real life of it all.  TY isn't supposed to give us that. It's supposed to give us an nice happy ending in about 30 min. and send us off feeling like we've just taken a valium and all is right with the world  WAKE UP...Life Is Everywhere  Even In the Idiot Box...",1075161600,5,1446,3.986159169550173
1864944,3,B00008WJBO,"It reminded me of Hellraiser. Only without the boxes, or Pinhead; same theme in a way. The dangers of obsession with solving things.
It was very good untill the ending. Definitely a rental, that you can pause to catch the riddles written on the walls. I liked the riddles, and the cinematography. And the idea of the game. I liked the movie in general.
I liked that Google.com was in it (in a very small, supporting role).
I was going to say it was a good idea poorly designed; but that's just a play on the movie, and not really fair. It was well designed, just with a somewhat lame ending. Oh well...",1070841600,5,602,4.336283185840708
1864945,4,B00008WJBO,"This film has to have one of the most irritating beginning.  IT plays a about two minutes and credits break in.  Well some films do that.  But this KEEPS doing that.  Once it finally gets past that, you have a nice small film, but it tries to tell you it's a smart film, no show you.  It's well acted with Ian McShane as a police inspector, with a daughter in school named Sara.  Sara plays games with a video store owner, Highlander's Adrian Paul.  But then someone ups the stakes of their games...
The abrupt ending hurt the film, but all in all a very enjoyable effort - and hey, I would watch anything with McShane in it!!",1070150400,4,626,4.254237288135593
1864946,3,B00008WJBO,"After viewing this flick I had this sense that there was more to it than meets the eye or cerebral cortex...Nope. Is it entertaining and mind boggling? To a certain degree. Just don't get your hopes up. The only thing the quick and abrupt ending accomplishes is leaving the viewer cheated; Not because there should be a neat tidy happy ending but because literally the ending will have you saying ""what the...""
 A college girl pals around with a comic/video/music/book store owner played by Higlander's (tv series) Adrian Paul.  Vern and Sara keep each other company by playing and solving riddles. However, they soon become involved in a series of deadly riddles left and led by a mysterious source. If the riddles or series of them are solved then the winner hits the jackpot by seeing what the enigmatic ""design"" or meaning is behind them---""see the big picture"" routine (meaning of life? our universal existence? the murders? who really cares). Unfortunately, people get killed as part of the ""design"" and for some odd reason those who have played the game end up going nutso (or are nutso to begin with) and confessing to the murders. Unfortunately, once the viewer finds out or doesn't really find out why the killings take place (other than to continue what was started by an ancient Buddhist monk,a.k.a Nemesis) there really is nothing deep or shocking...
Also, why is it then whenever some people see an indie film they always have to read too deep into it or rave about it's greatness. When a film is bad or lacks something, it's because it is bad and lacks something...I too enjoy indie films. But, just like your mainstream Hollywood stuff some indie films cannot always escape from the fact that it was bad or lacking. Nemesis Game is not the worst I have seen and is not the best.
Paul can act but he keeps pretty much low keyed these days with these low budget Canadian productions. Carly Pope does an amazing job with what she was given. But she could have gone further given more intense or intellectually stimulating material...
3 stars for great acting and a plot or story that started out with great promise but...well, you decide.",1069372800,14,2151,4.748663101604278
1864947,4,B00008WJBO,"The idea behind this movie is very cool... that there is a ""design"" or pattern to every single thing that happens in life and that it is possible to ""see"" this design and your place within it by solving certain riddles.
Sara and Vern are both particularly anxious to find this hidden design because they are both people who have suffered horrible losses in life and who want desperately to find some ""reason"" for these disasters. This obsessive need to understand/find the design leads them into this bizarre world of hidden riddles and seemingly random murders. And once they get pulled into it, there's no getting out.
There's a lot to like about this movie. It's clever, well acted, and it moves along at a good pace. The problem is that the ending is much too abrupt and doesn't really answer any of the questions that have been set up. Mind you, a certain degree of ambiguity at the end of a movie is fine... sometimes it's best to end a story without a pat resolution to everything that's happened. But in this particular case, it isn't a feeling of ambiguity so much as a sense that the writer of the film didn't really know where to go with it. It just ends...
For those who appreciate a cerebral thriller, ""Nemesis Game"" is a perfectly entertaining 90 minutes. There's a lot to like about this movie; just don't expect too much. It's good, but it falls short of what it could have been.",1067558400,6,1395,4.517786561264822
1864948,5,B00008WJBO,"Very fun movie to watch. Loved the riddles, love Adrian!
The whole movie is basically a game in which the players try to puzzle out the meaning of life and death. I believe the plot was well organized and it kept me very interested.
This was the first film I have seen staring Carly Pope and I was impressed with her acting ability.
I'm keeping my copy of this movie.",1065830400,,367,4.257142857142857
1864949,5,B00008WJBO,"Nemesis Game is a smart ""indie"" thriller, with more-than""indie"" qualities. It is the story of a young woman, Sara Novak, who is a college student. Sara (Carly Pope) spends her time at a shop with Vern (Adrian Paul). At this shop Vern and Sara play games and solve riddles. That is the basic premise of Nemesis Game.
  The acting in Nemesis Game is amazing. Carly Pope is great in this film. Her facial expressions add a lot to the character. Adrian Paul, who I have never seen in anything before, is also a fine actor. He plays the character of Vern very well. Rena Owen plays the insane murderer, Emily Gray. Rena takes this film to a whole new level. Her character is so in depth that I can't picture anyone else playing it. Brendan Fehr is also great, playing the mysterious ""skateboarder,"" but his character has much more to do with the film. Ian McShane is also great as Sara's dad. The supporting cast (including: Jay Baruchel and Vanessa Guy) are also great. I do not think this film could have been better cast. The people in charge of casting this film did a wonderful job.
  Jesse Warn, first time film director, directed Nemesis Game. He did a wonderful job. He also wrote the screenplay, which is so amazing. I think a director cares more about a film, and how it turns out when they write the script. The producers of this film also do an amazing job.
  The plot of Nemesis Game plays out very well. So many things that you see in the beginning of the film do not seem important, but later in the film they will play a key role. The plot also has its share of twists, and that is always great in a film. You can never guess what will happen next, and you will probably even have a hard time guessing the answers to the many riddles used in the movie. Nemesis Game has the ability to keep you ""on the edge of your seat"" with suspense.
  I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a great thriller, or just a good movie in general. The DVD also includes ""the making of Nemesis Game,"" The Nemesis Game trailer, full-length commentary by the director and one of the producers, English and Spanish subtitles, trailers for two other great Lions Gate films, and it is presented in widescreen format, which I usually do not like, but the format makes Nemesis Game all the more exiting. If you do not see this film, you must be crazy. I give Nemesis Game 10 out of 10 stars (**********).",1057795200,17,2403,4.384269662921349
1864950,5,B00008WJBO,"I rented the NEMESIS GAME DVD last week and I can say it is one of the best thrillers I have ever watched.  It revolves around a shy college student, Sara Novak(Carly Pope), and Vern Stevens(Adrian Paul) who is an older guy who works at a comic book/riddle shop.  Sara and Vern have a passion for games and riddles.  Sara and Vern get involved in a game of the riddles that will eventually lead to the answer to the design of the universe.  One of Sara's fellow students ends up dead and Sara (and Vern) get deeper into the Nemesis Game.  The movie also stars Rena Owen (as Emily Grey who tried to kill a 12 year old boy because it was part of the design), Brendan Fehr, and Ian McShane as Detective Jeff Novak.  The ending is a surprise in this well shot movie done by first time film director Jesse warn (who has directed music videos in new Zeland).  This is a well acted movie that features one of the best performances Adrian Paul has given as an actor.  The music score is moody too.
If you're looking for a good independent thriller that makes you think, buy it.  If you're an Adrian Paul fan, buy it.  I intend to buy this DVD soon because it is a good movie.",1056153600,14,1167,4.216216216216216
1864951,3,B00008WJBO,"The screenwriter and the protagonist are interested in the meaning of life. Is there a purpose, a design? Is there a reason the protagonist's mom dies in a car accident while the protagonist, Sara lives? The film is a series of riddles. Some we figure out, some no one does. Some viewers are frustrated that they didn't get an answer to what the Design is at the end. But, that's the point. The father gives the message moments before the end: ""It's human not to know the answers and to live on anyway."" So, if viewers thought there'd be an explanation of the Design, they missed the point of the movie: life is a series of what looks like riddles. Do the answers lead somewhere, i.e., is there a purpose? In the movie, answers lead to an abandoned building where nothing is but death. Get it? We're just answering silly riddles only to end up at death's door without real answers. The ending of the movie seems like a mistake. But it's not. The film hints that there is some design... given the ""knowing"" look of the crazy woman who tried to kill the child, and the epitaph of the movie where everyone who had handled the blue spray can is listed. But each of the people spraying the riddles is just a riddler. That is, there is no Design, there are only riddlers, like Aristotle, Descartes and Nietzsche, that start out the film. They are the philosophers who spray with blue paint and hint at the meaning of life who keep people guessing. I think the screenwriter's real answer is said at the beginning of the film, ""Life has no meaning. We make up all meaning in our heads.""

So, the film works a bit on the level of creepy, murder mystery but also on this metaphysical level, where Sara is everyman/woman searching for the meaning of life only to die before discovering it. Ironically, what she's looking for is said at the beginning. ""Life has no meaning and we make meaning out of everything--it's all in our heads."" There's nothing to go find, nothing to riddle out.

So, the movie kept me guessing. The metaphysical part was too obtrusive at the beginning and lead the director and actors in the wrong direction at times.. Sara acts like she's in a state of shock throughout the film, which was a mistake. Everyone is terribly alone in the film, except for the dad and his new wife. Otherwise, everyone's a loner. So, okay film, scary at times, didn't engage me other than fear. As for the metaphysical revelation that there is no meaning, and that everything is filled with meaning by the eye of the beholder.... that's just one more riddle on the wall.",1473120000,3,2563,4.521551724137931

At first, I was hoping for a nice tatted tea cozy or a cross stitch sampler, but no, the design in question tends to lean towards vague implications on a grand scale that only a few disillusioned nincompoops could comprehend.  The answer to THE design inevitably led to death, madness, and incarceration.  Not many options there, but you can also add boredom on a level few strive for, managing to make a 92 minute faux-thriller-flick feel like an endurance race uphill and in the dark.  It didn't help that most of the burden of this sparse plot landed on Carly Pope, whose blank expression didn't amount to much in the way of a performance.  She posed like a mannequin throughout, moving like a top model on a runway in Paris every time she was called on to walk any great distance.  It was amusing for the first few minutes, tedious by the end.  This was no damsel in distress; this was a girl on a rampage of disinterest.  Apathy is what sunk this project.

1864970,1,B00008WJBO,"I watched this movie on television, wanted to see it because of Ian McShane. Adrian Paul was an added bonus, truly a bonus. The thing about this movie that makes me say it could have been better was it left holes. Perhaps that was intentional and I'm just a plodding predictable movie viewer but I didn't like how in one scene you see a photograph of the detective, his daughter and Emily and they are all smiling. This for me was a WTF moment. This was never explained in the movie and the connection of how Emily knew what she did about the detective's wife's accident is another weird moment. Vern's (Adrian Paul) involvement is creepy but still cool. The riddle game was interesting but what did the flashing photos have to add besides shock or creep out value? Anyway this for me is a once in awhile viewing pleasure. Watch it once and then hope you forget before you watch it again. Best part is the beginning when Ian Mcshane is intergotating Emily. I did like the way they intermixed things like the opening scene which actually happened later but the ending still leaves you feeling left out of the loop.",1323388800,,1113,4.514851485148514
1864971,2,B00008WJBO,"Personally, I hate riddles - but the characters in this movie certainly love them.  College student Sara Novak (Carly Pope) spends her nights wandering through seedy parts of town trying to solve riddles/puzzles assigned to her by her own little riddle guru, comic book store owner Vern (Adrian Paul).  It's all fun and games of course (well, games, anyway - I can't say any of it was fun) until someone gets hurt (or violently murdered).  It turns out that there's a much bigger game in town, one that promises enlightenment to whoever makes his/her way to the end.  Ultimate insight into the Design is not easily won, however - this is a most dangerous game.

Vern is none too happy to discover that Sara has started playing the Nemesis game, ostensibly because players either end up dead or stark raving mad (even the winners).  If ever there were a game where nobody really wins, it's this one.  As if the whole concept of the Nemesis game isn't bad enough, watching Sara and Vern go about their riddle-obsessed lives is torturously boring.  The only halfway interesting person in the entire film is one of Sara's classmates who (for reasons I can't fathom) actually finds the young lady mysterious and intriguing, to the point that he is determined to find out what she does at night - the poor dope apparently has no life whatsoever.

Maybe this film is meant to serve as a larger metaphor for life - or maybe there's no meaning whatsoever to take away from it.  Personally, I'm going with the latter choice.  With its depressing atmosphere, uninteresting characters, convoluted plot, rather flimsy premise (to my way of thinking), and hackneyed ending, Nemesis Game never succeeded at pulling me in to its cinematic world.  Some may find it to be an interesting, thinking person's film, but I found the whole experience pretentious at best.  Even if you're one of the lucky ones who actually find something stimulating in this whole ordeal, the ending is likely to leave you feeling cheated.  I really don't think your average horror fan is going to enjoy Nemesis Game very much at all; this is really much more of a psychological suspense thriller (with very little suspense and almost no thrills).",1266883200,,2206,4.801587301587301

I enjoy solving riddles but would not agree that being murdered just because I was able to solve the path of riddles will show me the the meaning of life. We all know the answer to that one without solving riddles/ going crazy/ being murdered - we all die at the end -  the meaning is in what we do with our life. It's the same concept as the question ""why is what we are looking for always in the last place we look?"" Simple - we found it and therefore have no reason to continue looking.  I watched this movie twice and still can't solve the riddle of why this movie was written/ produced/ directed.

1864975,3,B00008WJBO,"As an indy and director's first film, pretty good and worth watching. I liked the photography, especially nice lighting on abandoned buildings etc. The acting was quite okay. For me it was effectively creepy and in that sense engaging.

Why was it creepy? Some of the main characters looked like they were on the verge of insanity -- the line was not clear -- and that was portrayed darkly and that is creepy for me. The characters are driven by compulsive curiosity about the riddles and such even though it could get them killed. This sort of risky thing does emerge in human nature, and we all have to learn how to deal with it. Most maybe learn to just not go there. But for others it can suck one into what ends up being dangerous games. Sometimes in life -- especially among the young -- it can looks as though we are surrounded by people compulsively playing games with each other out of curiosity that can get out of hand.

That is what resonated with me. If that was ""the point"" of the film I am not sure that it was well presented, so I am reluctant to credit it.

Also the sequences in the film seemed to jump around unnecessarily and I found that distracting. But maybe that was me. Still, I enjoyed the film for the photography and tense atmosphere. It was not a cliche of horror and suspense films but did have a provocative psychological element that for me was compellingly presented.

I will say that some of the characters were hoping to get out of the game the answer to the riddle of life -- the big one. That can seem corny on the one hand, but on the other there are many people who can probably relate to this the film can remind one of this. People fall into cults and causes right and left!! This game is by no means a conventional cult, though. It consists of players who do not seem to know each other face to face and is much more abstract and not held together by the usual tricks. Personally I thought that this was an interesting idea and would have liked to seen it better explored. If I watch it again I will spend more time trying to decide if there was actually more there than I caught.

Despite some of the clever riddles, the movie makes little if any sense, and the wonderful character actor Ian McShane is wasted in the role of Sara's father, a policeman.

An interesting premise but I hate movies where everything is so ambiguous, you get no payoff.  If that's the ""design"" of life, we're in big trouble.",1095379200,6,749,4.828125

7987485,2,B00008WJBO,"Not that I couldn't write a long and philosophical analysis of this film I could, but what would be the point? If only the screenwriter had asked himself the same question. This movie's plot was difficult - no, impossible - to divine (no pun intended). SPOILER ALERT - Only one of the characters was sympathetic, and they killed her off at the end to underscore the apparent point, that there is no point. Basically, the writer and the director tricked us into watching this meaningless drivel. Thank goodness I didn't pay anything to see it. Pardon me for saying so, but if you're smart, you'll watch something else - even if it stars David Hasselhoff.",1488931200,,653,4.6869565217391305

Given this, I normally watch a movie to it's conclusion...I didn't now.  Therefore, I cannot give it any more stars.  Sorry...",1482278400,,277,4.551020408163265
