This one-hour film accurately captures the struggle to gain approval to build an underground  transportation network to relieve New York's clogged streets, and the  myriad engineering challenges that had to be overcome in order to make the  dream a reality.  Through archival photographs, transcripts and  contemporary newspaper accounts, this documentary also brings this story  down to the human level by chronicling the working conditions below the  earth, and how the success of this project hinged on the perseverance of  just a few people.  Well done and highly recommended.",956361600,13,703,5.36697247706422
642831,5,6303408524,"""Alone on the Ice"" is a one-hour documentary of Admiral Richard Byrd's life, with special emphasis on his controversial and ill-advised attempt to spend a winter alone on the South Pole.
This short film  manages to capture the complex character of this man and why he felt driven  to attempt feats that no one had ever done before.  The film chronicles his  now-disputed flight to the North Pole, and his South Pole expeditions.  Incorporating actual footage, interviews with friends and family and still  photographs, producer Nancy Porter brings back to life one of America's  forgotten heroes.  Like his contemporary and friend Charles Lindbergh, Bryd  was an intensely private man whose exploits placed him in the spotlight.  This dichotomy in his character is well explored here.
Porter spends the  majority of the documentary on Byrd's last great publicity stunt:  his  attempt to spend an Anarctic winter alone.  The film captures well the  foolishness of this effort, backed by interviews with members of Bryd's  expedition.  ""Alone on the Ice"" is an excellent film which  objectively examines one of the last great explorers of our times.  Highly  recommended.",956361600,3,1169,5.216216216216216

642919,5,6303408524,"This is, in my opinion, the single best historical documentary on the Kennedy Family available today, despite the fact that is a decade old.  No single historical docudrama can completely capture the accents, mannerisms, or nuances of the original Kennedy clan, but if I were very interested in the subject (as I definitely am), I would recommend that this DVD set be viewed first, followed by two biopics:  Greg Kinnear et. al. (The Kennedys, 2011) and Martin Sheen's Kennedy (1981).  If you can afford it, buy all three of the DVD sets referenced above. If you can only buy one, get this one.
Viewing all three sets will give you the most insightful and entertaining look possible into what remains to this day as America's most beloved (and controversial) political family.

  What makes this particular set so special despite its age?  For one thing, the documentary handles all major male members of the clan (Joe Sr., Joe Jr., Jack, Bobby, and Ted) in a balanced, even-handed fashion throughout.  Warts and all, the ups and downs of the family, through the influence of Joe Sr. all the way to Ted Kennedy's career) are handled in an unflinching yet diplomatic fashion.  For another, there is a WEALTH of extras in this set, including the full text and delivery of several of JFK's speeches and commentaries from the original members of JFK's White House staff.

  Can this set be improved?  Sure--by eventually adding updates on JFK Jr.'s career and demise, as well separate,full-length treatments of the remarkable Kennedy ladies--most notably Jackie, Rose, and Eunice.  Until PBS decides to do such an update, this is the best single video resource on the Kennedy Family around today.  Buy it; you will not be disappointed and will, quite possibly, be mesmerized.  Very few historical documentaries pack this kind of punch after being around for a decade.",1425945600,7,1863,4.961290322580645

642970,3,6303408524,"The 1989 ""American Experience"" episode ""The Great War 1918"" looks back at the first world war, known at that time as The Great War, and America's involvement in that war. The war itself had been dragging on in Europe for three years before the United States would become involved. And during those first three years the U. S. did everything it could to stay out of becoming involved with the war. Americans looked at the war being fought in Europe as a tragedy but it was Europe's tragedy. Plus it was only roughly 50 years since the end of the American Civil War and there were still many Americans alive who remembered the horror that war produced that made them not want any part of the European war. President Woodrow Wilson even won re-election in 1916 under the slogan ""He kept Us Out Of War"" determined the country stayed clear of the slaughter that was taking place half way around the world. Of course circumstances would eventually arise that would finally draw the United States into the war in 1917. By 1918 U.S. troops were ready to fight along the front lines. And of course by November of 1918 Germany was ready to work out an armistice to bring the fighting to a halt. The amount of time U.S. troops actually spent fighting the war was small compared to the rest of Europe. Still the country suffered a high amount of casualties during that time. Still while the troops didn't spent all that much time in battle the presence of the U.S. Army in the war would tip the balance of power to the west that Germany could not withstand. 2014 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of The Great War. The after effects of that war and what would take place during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference that would officially end the war would go on to shape the events that would take place around the world for the rest of the 20th century and well into the 21st century. Sadly I fear the majority of Americans today do not understand just how we are effected by that war 100 years later.

The problem with this DVD is that while interesting it really doesn't do a whole lot to educate Americans 100 years later what the war was about or even what started it in the first place. As I already mentioned ""The Great War 1918"" picks up with the U.S. preparing to go into war but without going into the details why we decided we finally had to enter it. It doesn't get into not even briefly just how the Great War started to begin with. I understand this documentary is just looking at the United States involvement in the war but you have to spend the time giving some explanation of events both before and during the First World War to understand what would lead to the U.S. getting into the fight. As a result it leaves the viewer with a few interesting facts but in the end badly uninformed just what was taking place. For someone who knows little to nothing about the first war to be fought on a world wide scale will not come away from watching this anymore informed or educated on it. The only interesting part to the documentary is the collection of WW I veterans who talk about their experiences during the war and what they saw and heard.

In the end even though this is from the ""American Experience"" series, and they usually have some outstanding programs, I can't recommend this DVD. For the history nerds like me out there you will find this sorely lacking in information. For someone who is looking to learn more about the ""Great War"" will learn really nothing from this DVD.",1405209600,,3488,4.4655172413793105

642999,5,6303408524,"The original 1989 AMERICAN EXPERIENCE episode entitled ""The Great War 1918"" was narrated by Eric Sevareid. Memories of surviving participants add much to antique film and 78 rpm record clips in telling this story.

The Great War's death toll: 18 million. Although the US was officially neutral, its industry was enriched by this conflagration, supplying the matriel of war to allies. Pres. Wilson was originally against American involvement, but after many US ships were sunk he asked Congress in Feb '17 for a war declaration. Two months later, Gen. Pershing left for Europe. The previous winter had been brutal. Many on the Continent were in a state of starvation.

In early 1917, most Americans were still unconvinced that we should get involved. Propagandistic films and personal appearances by Hollywood stars helped sway public opinion. Recruiting was often done in movie houses. Those willing to volunteer were bused from theaters to recruiting stations and then directly to training camps. Some men just seemed to vanish from home and job.

Eventually, the largest US Army ever assembled was sent to France. At first the French military derisively called the arriving doughboys a ""Children's Crusade,"" but a quarter-million fresh troops, shipped in at the rate of 10,000 a day, would in 1918 prove decisive in defeating Germany.

The winter of 1917-18 was one of the coldest on record. An enemy spring offensive was initially successful, but by summer, with their supplies and men exhausted, this advance was stopped and reversed. With the US Army at full strength in August '18, the Meuse/Argonne campaign was begun, first with a pre-dawn bombardment from 2,700 artillery pieces, followed by a general advance over torn up and barb wire strewn ground. The American casualty rate from enemy gunfire, artillery and gas was appalling, yet the sheer weight of numbers and supplies would eventually be a major factor in an Allied victory. This offensive would be the last major battle of WWI.

Official German surrender came on 11/11/18 - Armistice Day. With a widespread ceasefire in place, anti-fraternization orders were often ignored. The evil enemy proved to be men who were very much like their opposites. Pres. Wilson's advocacy of a ""just and lasting peace"" was ignored. The oppressive 1919 Treaty of Versailles would, just two decades later, be a reason for Germany's militaristic build-up prior to WWII.",1371945600,,2417,5.187179487179487

643001,4,6303408524,"This version of Earhart's story has a somewhat not so subtle bias against Earhart's mother, calling her 'domineering'.  I have only read two books about Earhart, but there are so many discrepancies in all them, and the A&E video, and this movie, it is really a wonderful mystery to know what is true and what is fiction.  Many good insights and details in this video which are missing from the A&E video.  I very much like the focus on her public image, and how popular she was, and like the rock star simile - it seems to be the truth.  This does have some unique footage, and this is definitely worth viewing for those interested in early aviation and what makes a modern hero (media coverage!).  The although video definitely focuses on Putnam's expert promotion of Earhart, it doesn't paint a great picture of him as a human, using Gore Vidal to state he was not well liked by others.  Based on what I've read and seen so far, it seems Earhart knew exactly what she was getting into when she made her deal with Putnam, and she appreciated it.  It doesn't seem from her writing that she felt abused, though she was certainly put through hoops: It was the price to pay in order to afford flying, which was her true passion.  Putnam must have known this, and they very much appeared to have an understanding of what was the biggest priority in this relationship - flying.",1366416000,,1372,4.504032258064516

643045,2,6303408524,"I would like to note that as PBS spent public money on this thing, both donations and tax dollars, that it is infuriating when they spend the money on the presentation of wrong information.
They have an historian, Walter LaFeber (a guy at Cornell, good grief!), who states that the US wanted the Philippine islands in order to project US business into China. He makes no mention of the strategic situation, which should be obvious to anyone who looks at a map and remembers the situation in 1899-1900. If the US had left the Philippines in 1899, the islands would have been ripe for a quick takeover by Japan, China, France (whose Indochina colony was right across the water). LaFeber too quickly dismisses the notion that McKinley decided for the US to stay in the Philippines for as long as it took to inculturate them in Democracy and Free Trade (two of the essentials in Michael Mandelbaum's trio of essentials, with the US providing the islands with the third, security).
Later, LaFeber makes the erroneous claim that the Spanish-American War was the USA's first conflict outside of the Western Hemisphere; it was not, that was the Tripolitan War in the early 1800s.
LaFeber also makes a big deal, in what is not much more than a moot point, in McKinley ordering US forces into China to rescue Americans from captivity by the Boxers. He states this is the first time a US president had done this without consulting with Congress. Was Congress even in session when this was done? No mention by him or in the film. Congress was not in session in the Spring of 1861 when Lincoln suspended habeas corpus, and he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, a policy statement bound to war strategy, as an executive order.
Somehow, I think the impending harm of Americans qualifies as the type of decision described above.
There also is no mention in this film of McKinley's pronouncement of an ""Open Door"" policy with regard to western nations trading with China. No mention at all, of a key policy proposal, made in the interests of fair play by President McKinley. Why is that?
Throughout, they make a big deal out of the growing appearance of light bulbs, phonograph record players, movies. But they do not mention, not even once, the guy who invented these things, Thomas Edison. They talk long and hard about a labor union leader, Marshall, but captains of industry, inventors and the like are kept invisible or in the back seat. They are only mentioned when someone is apparently needed to support a point that seems to fit a historical revisionists/political thrust, as when Andrew Carnegie is cited for being ""anti-imperialist"" and opposed to the conflict in the Philippines with the insurrectionaries there.
At the end, the narrator makes the claim that America in 1900 was ""the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth."" Well, in 1900 the first claim is debatable, the last is absurdly fallacious. If ""powerful"" refers to military power, than the United States had at least two world powers ranked ahead of it in 1900, Great Britain and Germany of the Second Reich. France of the Third Republic may have been a close fourth, perhaps even in a tie for third with the USA. But PBS producers, particularly those who contribute programs to this series, American Experience, seem to love to indulge in this particular act of hyperbole, as the same claim ""most powerful nation on earth"" was made for the USA of 1890 in the documentary The Way West.

643108,5,6303408524,"The American Experience: Meltdown at Three Mile Island delivers an incredibly informative look at the events surrounding the Three Mile Island accident that took place in March 1979.  I remember hearing about the incident and knowing it was pretty serious, but I was just a kid at the time, and Pennsylvania was a good distance away from my home in North Carolina.  In my memory, it was just a close call, here and gone rather quickly.  As I grew older, I got a better sense of just how potentially catastrophic the situation was at the time, but I can't say I ever learned very much about the details of the accident - until now.  This 1999 documentary was, in a word, eye-opening, detailing the circumstances that led to the accident, the decisions that exacerbated the problem, and the alarmingly unprepared reaction of all concerned parties to what we now know was indeed a partial meltdown of a nuclear core.  Behind-the-scenes footage from the time really conveys the chaos that defined the Three Mile Island accident - and it is almost as frightening as the accident itself.

This accident was actually a five-day ordeal that was and is disturbing on many levels, mainly because no one seemed to know what the hell they were doing - and communication between plant representatives and government agencies on all levels was, to put it quite lightly, exceedingly poor.  This documentary takes you through the series of events characterizing these days - in both a technical and a public relations sense.  You'll learn how a simple valve malfunction and plant engineers' misinterpretation of data from the #2 reactor almost resulted in a nuclear disaster; how obfuscation and contradictory statements by plant spokesmen sewed distrust among city and state officials (not to mention the public); how little authority the Nuclear Regulatory Commission actually had at that time in the construction and operation of nuclear plants; and how difficult it was for Pennsylvania governor Dick Thornburgh to get the information he needed in order to know whether or not to evacuate the surrounding areas (and how problematic such an evacuation protocol would have been).  The control room at TMI had only two phones, which made it all but impossible for NRC officials and the men who designed the plant to reach anyone on-site directly.  In the governor's office, Dick Thornburgh h had communication problems of his own.  NRC officials were difficult to reach, and it took President Carter himself a good hour to get through to his office.  Complicating matters for Thornburgh was the fact that expert opinion varied significantly, so much so that he ended up trusting the word of those there on the ground over the opinions of Washington experts.  I can understand how Thornburgh struggled mightily over the question of evacuating the area (which included the state capital of Harrisburg) based on incomplete and contradictory information, but I have to question his slowness to act - by the fifth day of the crisis, some experts argued that the plant could actually explode at any moment, the effects of which would have been catastrophic.  Clearly, the whole subject remains highly debatable today.

I know I have a much better understanding of the Three Mile Island accident after watching this fascinating documentary.  It really does an amazing job covering all of the angles of the crisis, in human as well as technical terms.  This was an event that never should have taken place, and one can easily see that catastrophe was narrowly averted despite a series of human failures and mistakes.  Plant engineers misinterpreted a comparatively simple problem and brought about the crisis by a series of decisions that did much more harm than good.  At the same time, the NRC and the federal government proved to be wholly unprepared and often completely stymied in terms of their reaction to the situation.

It's rare that one event can intricately involve so many different aspects of modern life - and even more rare that a one-hour documentary can touch upon so many of them in such a meaningful and instructive way.  It's a pity this 1999 PBS video isn't available on DVD, especially since the issues addressed herein are no less important now than they were at the time of production.",1234656000,,4287,4.976190476190476

643147,5,6303408524,"THE GREAT WAR 1918 is part of The American Experience series produced by PBS. These shows originally aired on PBS. If I am not mistaken, THE GREAT WAR 1918 aired in either 1990 or 1991. This documentary is about 55 minutes long.  It begins with an introduction by David McCullough. The strength of the film comes from two types of sources:  original film reels and interviews with those who fought in WWI.  As David McCullough has pointed out before (but not on this video) history is made real when we know the people who were there; it is their stories that bring history to life.  It is debatable whether the American Civil War or WWI was the first modern war. I'd argue that WWI was because it took place on a global scale and this film does a wonderful job at illustrating at exactly how devastating that conflict was. The documentary follows the war from the time the U.S. originally entered the conflict in the fall of 1917 until the signing of the Armistice in November of 1918.  I really enjoy listening to the survivors tell part of there stories. One that sticks out to me is the one when this elderly man is recalling when a fellow soldier came in contact with mustard gas;  the soldier clawed himself to death in front of his buddy's eyes. An image like that will always stay with you and I'll know I'll always think about that story whenever WWI is mentioned and discussed.",1138752000,50,1387,4.50597609561753
643148,5,6303408524,"Very informative documentary regarding the Kennedy family.  I was especially impressed with the early clips of Joe, Jr., Rosemary & Kathleen, who are often referred to in other programs about the Kennedys, but rarely seen.  The color home movie clips of Joe. Jr. & Kathleen playing poolside struck me as both sweet and sad.  Another short video clip of Joe, Jr. greeting and shaking hands with his fellow Liberator pilots seems to give a glimpse into the politician he may have become had he lived.  Watching him, it is certainly clear to see who got the looks in the family.  This documentary is also a wonderful trip through recent American history.  Whether you love or hate the Kennedys, I think you'll find this program interesting.",1123113600,8,737,4.856

643150,5,6303408524,"Documentaries and dramatizations about the Kennedys tend to either portray the family as saints or devils. Either Jack, Bobby and Teddy are the shining knights of Camelot or they're corrupt devils who can't control their sexual urges. The American Experience documentary about the family avoids this heaven or hell approach and does a nice, balanced job of showing the history of Joseph Kennedy and his children.

On one hand, we hear revelations of Joseph Kennedy's anti-Semitism and the capitulation to Hitler that ultimately cost him his chance at the White House. We hear how precarious JFK's health actually was, his initial tepid response to the civil rights' movement and his reckless womanizing that threatened to bring Camelot crashing down. We hear about RFK's service to Joseph McCarthy, his ruthlessness and his inability to compromise. We hear about Ted Kennedy's womanizing and excessive drinking and find out just how irresponsibly he acted during the Chappaquiddick incident.

However, the film also discusses JFK's heroism during World War II, the Kennedy brothers' conversion into champions of the civil rights movement, RFK's conversion into a sincere champion of minorities and the poor, Ted Kennedy's excellent record of service in the U.S. Senate and the family's long and distinguished record of public service. Despite their flaws, when JFK and RFK are assassinated, we feel the loss and mourn what might have been had they lived.

The film has a huge wealth of archival footage and photographs as well as the testimonies of historians like Doris Kearns Goodwin and Michael Bechloss, journalists like Ben Bradlee, Kennedy family friends like Dave Powers and Chuck Spalding, Kennedy advisors like Theodore Sorenson, Richard Goodwin and Adam Walinsky and even Senator Ted Kennedy himself. It thankfully avoids the cheesy re-creations that are so prevalent in modern documentaries. PBS has established itself over the years as a producer of some of the most high quality documetaries ever made. But The Kennedys outdoes even that standard.

The truth was that the Kennedy's were tremendously flawed human beings who nevertheless spoke for those Americans who couldn't fight for themselves. If you want the true unfiltered essence of who the Kennedys were, please see this documentary.",1097366400,51,2305,5.359116022099448

The production of the DVD includes a wonderful blend of a wide variety of people being interviewed along with actual footage of the Kennedys, dating to the Ambassador's time in England up to the 1980's (or thereabouts).
I've seen a lot of Kennedy films and this one includes new footage that I have yet to see in any other video, which is one of the biggest reasons why I feel it is quite unique and interesting to watch.  I was also especially intrigued with the narrative style and the content of the interviews.

643152,5,6303408524,"This PBS Home Video presentation is riveting.  It really puts you back in time to early 1979, when the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant in Pennsylvania survived the worst accident of its kind in U.S. history.

The behind-the-scenes footage within the plant itself (and in surrounding neighborhoods) is as good as having a time machine, with its settings focused on March 1979.  We watch the near-tragedy unfold, step-by-step and day-by-day, including plentiful footage of Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh as he deals with the crisis at hand.

It's chilling and frightening (even today) to think of what MIGHT have occurred had the runaway nuclear reactor not been brought under control.  And this video is the best way you could ever possibly re-live those numbing events.

Highly recommended.",1066348800,3,797,5.285714285714286
643153,4,6303408524,"In upstate New York in 1848 two young sisters, Katie and Margaret Fox, heard strange rapping noises in their home.  This simple beginning inspired the spiritualism craze that spread throughout the United States in the mid-19th century.  The noises were attributed to a ghostly spirit and hundred of people, including prominent newspaper editor Horace Greeley, showed up hoping to speak with dead relatives.  Suddenly  seances became commonplace around the world and thousands of ""eyewitness"" accounts of levitations, spirit sightings, and messages from the dead were published in newspapers and magazines.  From common folk to the rich and famous, everyone seemed to be caught up in the spiritualism craze.  This hour long documentary, narrated by ""The Exorcist"" star Ellen Burstyn, does a nice job of explaining how the fascination with Spiritualism was affected by the new age of science and Victorian morality.  Spiritualism actually revitalized religion in America at a time when only one-fourth of the population belonged to a church.  By offering ""scientific proof"" of life after death, spiritualists actually gave credence to what had always been a question of faith.  By the time Harry Houdini make a concerted effort to prove mediums were fakes, effectively ending the era of Spiritualism, it had already had a profound impact on American society and culture.  ""Telegrams From the Dead"" is really more than a 19th-Century version of ""The X-Files,"" since it makes a compelling case for the ultimate importance of all this nonsense.",1019952000,7,1539,5.348547717842323
643154,5,6303408524,"There is not too much to say about this video.  It is the best, by far, living memory (for those over 101 years and now for us) of an innocent and dark period.  I bought and saw this at least 2 years ago (also bought the must-have companion volume by Judy Crichton which is of the same excellent calibre), yet its images are burnt into my consciousness.  The snow on New Year's eve; the kids sledding and looking for all the world like nothing could go wrong in this coming century of all modern things; immigrants with hope on their faces for a new life; McKinley shaking thousands of hands at the White House; he, once a dashing Civil War hero and his wife, once a beauty now with epilepsy, sharing a loving marriage of 30 years; brutal strikes and mine explosions leaving hundreds dead; the Boxer rebellion in China; the horrific Galveston flood, on par with death as the events of our 9-11; but through it all innocence, optimism, rising prosperity.  Then, in 1901, McKinley assassinated, his almost Shakespearean words on being shot: ""My wife, be careful...how you tell her -- oh be careful.""  And then the call to TR, typically up on a mountaintop, to take the reins, which he did magnificently.  The video is superb technically for the era, the direction, editing and pacing electric.
