1378229,3,B00004YS68,"Greetings from Tromaville.
  Every true hardcore Troma fan has seen  ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" at least twice, so we are no doubt familiar with Mr. Reed's  wild rides. However, this movie is VERY different from ""B.S.F."" ! It's about a soldiers wild adventures in Singapore. Although the caged sexoids are missed, and there's not much bloodshed, it's still a pretty good movie proving that Joel M. Reed's name belongs up there with all the other great cult directors (Example: John Waters, Peter Jackson).

7927693,1,B00004YS68,"Dave Dearborn (Tom Keena, the most improbable action hero if ever there was one) is a journalist in Singapore on a assignment on a crime boss. He's soon awash with dealings with strippers, nuclear scientists, CIA operatives, and large-toothed mobsters (among others). The acting all around is atrocious, the plot, for lack of a better term, is a mess, the ""hero"" throughly unconvincing by any stretch of the imagination, and Janet Wood is the extremely unwanted love smitten girl who hangs on to Dave, all are rancid ingredients that torpedo this movie to the lower regions of cinema where all the other unwatchable turds dwell. Oh and if one were to edit out all the padding that the movie has it would be half an hour shorter at the least.",1517184000,,741,4.707692307692308

7927700,2,B00004YS68,"Where to begin? I got suckered into buying this because I'm on a Troma kick, the cover looks like the kind of action movie anyone could love, and it was 99 cents before shipping. What did I have to lose? 90 minutes, apparently. G.I. EXECUTIONER is a film in which things happen but as a whole it goes nowhere. A topless woman holding a gun is hardly the ""wildest all-nude shoot-out in film history"" as the blurb states, but there's the mastery of Troma over-exaggeration and self-promotion.

What you've got here is a boring movie full of boring characters that do very little for the runtime of the film. If you're a fan of director Joel Reed's BLOODSUCKING FREAKS and want to see what else he's done, don't. I like that film for pure exploitation goodness, but G.I. EXECUTIONER is definitely something to pass over.

This Troma DVD offers what you would expect, but with the added bonus of the transfer and sound not being total garbage. It was much, much better than I would have expected. Good for Troma for not botching a DVD release, even if the film is a garbage can like this one.

I can't recommend this movie with any kind of conviction. Just watch COMMANDO and run a google image search for ""boobs"" and you'll get much more out of your evening.",1364688000,2,1255,4.5198237885462555
7927701,1,B00004YS68,"Troma makes great movies.  However they also usually buy and distribute crap.  This is another one of those.

I really didn't like Joel Reed's ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" much.  It was hyped to be so extreme and really wasn't.  It also didn't have much comedy.

Well, G.I. Executioner is far tamed from that.  It's a long line of terrible dialogue and the only selling point is nudity.  I guess a girl shooting a gun while in the nude and being killed landing in a big net and hanging in the net nude is supposed to be the entertainment highlight of this film.",1134000000,4,554,4.47
7927702,4,B00004YS68,"I own this movie on Beta, its pretty good for a movie i had never heard of, some good action.  Not much violence, lots of running.  I do recommend it for an older action movie though.",1038614400,4,183,4.055555555555555
