4983989,4,B006DVB5XQ,"This Sci-Fi Drama was exactly as I remembered it, the reason I gave a four was because of the packaging. The manufacturing folks could have really just gone with a simpler system and had better protection for the disc. In 4 of the 5 seasons I purchased, there were discs flopping around inside the box. Luckly there wasn't any damage.",1294012800,2,334,4.583333333333333
4983990,3,B006DVB5XQ,"Earth Final Conflict is average, it does not compare with some of todays sci-fi shows, and is corny at times which detracts from what can be a interesting story (when it is consistent which is not all the time as the show disregards previous story lines that are contrary to new story lines with out explaining). the most interesting thing about this show is the actress that plays Renee Palmer I am unsure if I would have persevered with this show if the main character was not so attractive. Over all Earth Final Conflict is an okay, for a show that appears to have been made for day time TV

4983995,2,B006DVB5XQ,"Even from the first seconds of season 5, the new spoken intro by Jayne Heitmeyer (which sounded like Vogon poetry) signified that something was very askew. Completely off the rails, this was one of the most bizarre final seasons of any program ever; it should have just been renamed as a spinoff serial. The introduction of the Atavus (despicably ridiculous replacement villains) was solely for the sake of someone's perception that alien antagonists were a requirement for the show to go on.

The 5th is almost entirely carried by Sandoval and Renee, with occasional help from Street and Boone. If not for Jayne Heitmeyer and Melinda Deines being easy on the eyes, I likely would have given up on it altogether. Even so, Heitmeyer presented with the aura of an actor suffering from personal problems. Insomnia? Cocaine? Perhaps she was the victim of a deplorable makeup artist who, combined with bad lighting, unintentionally made her look like a drug addict?

Only the most dedicated fans will make it to the end of the season. At least it can be said that rather than going out with a whimper instead of a bang, it went out with a WTF?",1433635200,,1138,4.742424242424242

4984005,3,B006DVB5XQ,"The best example I have ever seen of how NOT to make a television series. The 1st Season was excellent and went downhill from there. By the 5th Season it had degenerated into the banal, trite, simplistic ""Chase the bad guy and beat him up"" plot from a thousand other TV shows that we have come to know and loathe. I wouldn't be surprised to have heard of a small vortex hovering over Gene Roddenberry's grave, from him spinning so fast. When his deceased spirit saw what had been done to his brainchild.
Between the death of a major producer, placing the wrong man in charge, excessive input from the new sponsor, changes in the acting talent and hiring cheap writers. I am not sure which had a worse effect. Even excellent actors can only do so much with a really bad script. It could have been so much better.",1406937600,8,811,4.413333333333333

4984007,3,B006DVB5XQ,"I enjoyed the show, even though it's kind of hokey now. The plot and acting pretty much was over the top for this season. The actors tried, but you can only do so much with the material. The lack of commitment on the producers' part to fully fund the show meant it has the same kind of anti-climax as Babylon 5's fifth season, because it was so in doubt it would happen they crammed season 4 and 5 story lines into season 4 and then find themselves with a whole season to fill up with afterthoughts.

At least I sure hope the Ativas folks were trying for campy in their acting, because that was the result.",1389744000,2,606,4.224137931034483
4984008,5,B006DVB5XQ,"An excellent series. Wish it would've run longer. It was kind of like ""V"" meets ""Red Dawn"".  If you liked those two shows you'll love this series.",1386892800,,146,4.407407407407407
4984009,5,B006DVB5XQ,"This series definitely holds ones attention.

The only problem for me was a lot of background music which was supposed to add to the ambiance but made it a bit hard to pick up some of the dialogue.

I loved it, though!",1371427200,,218,4.166666666666667

Sadly, the series lost a lead character and replaced the Taelons with a savage race of pure evil.  The series degenerates into a war drama against malevolent aliens.  Rather trite.",1365811200,2,345,4.879310344827586

4984013,1,B006DVB5XQ,"I was Seriously Disappointed with Season 5.  It was bad enough that they killed off or got rid of any character that was worth caring about then to add the rediculous Atavists, or whatever those hissing, glaring, supposed to be sexy things were.  I honestly didn't care about any character through this whole season.  Sad ending to what potentially was a good series despite all it's flaws.",1360627200,3,390,4.791044776119403
4984014,5,B006DVB5XQ,"Although none of the actors were familiar to me, they were superb.  The series concept was well-thought out and the sets and special effects were great.  Often, sci-fi movies/series can be cheesy with sub-standard music and dialogue, but it's easy to get caught up in and remain fascinated by this eries.  What's really good is that since there so many different plots going on in the series, the intro to each episode connects what's about to be shown with what has already transpired in the plot line.  Each season continues the same high quality.",1360540800,,549,4.808510638297872
4984015,5,B006DVB5XQ,"Some people do not like the fifth season of EFC.

I only saw one or two episodes when it came out, and did not like what I saw then.

However, after watching all of the episodes on DVD, I found the fifth season to be a good story and worthwhile TV show.  I would definitely recommend it.

My favorite bit from season 5:  seeing Zo'or in atavus form (in the episode ""Boone's Assassin"").  They should have kept her around!",1357516800,2,420,4.253164556962025
4984016,4,B006DVB5XQ,"What can be said about Earth Final Conflict's season 5? If you were a fan of Gene Roddenberry, most likely you were an EFC fan as well. Season five wrapped up the series and in some ways, the writers seemed to loose their way some. While still entertaining, the story-lines seemed to get off track from the original theme. I guess when series writers are notified that they will be out of a job soon, they turn into slackers who just write whatever to fulfill their contracts and end the series.

Anyhoo, I have the entire EFC series on DVD and enjoy watching it from time to time. In season five, the Talons are all but gone and a new alien has replaced them. The acting is good but as I mentioned before, the story-line suffers. Many of the original cast are gone as well. Why couldn't EFC had a great ending line Star Trek - TNG?

If you have the other EFC season DVDs, you need to get this one as well. Enjoy.",1348790400,3,913,4.241379310344827
4984017,4,B006DVB5XQ,"For the most part I was bored with the first 4 seasons of this show, but the last one puts an entirely different spin.  It creates more personalized tension on the part of the characters and more introspective intrigue which I find fascinating.  Renee Palmer along with a few friends is constantly fighting the Atavus whose leader Howlin eventually wants to marry Renee.  That is twisted and amusing at the same time!  Renee sort becomess a leader for the rebel cause but a sympathizer to all those who don't agree with what Howlin is doing on Earth.  This season shows more intrapersonal conflict associated with the characters.",1346112000,,629,4.841121495327103
4984018,4,B006DVB5XQ,this is the last season for the series. this season is not as good with the introduction of the Atavus that feed on humans and even turn humans into hybrids to repopulate their race. Renee feels all alone and struggles to fight the aliens and keep her sanity. I really liked the last episode that brings back a character from the past. Also a character from the first season resurfaces in a couple of episodes and falls in love with Renee.,1330387200,4,439,4.432098765432099
4984019,4,B006DVB5XQ,"Well, sad the series is over and a bit disappointed in the ending.  There was a loose end with Sandoval and Liam Kincaid that I would have liked to have seen before the series finished.  Since it was the last season, I was also disappointed with Boone's storyline and where were Marquette and Auger?  Over all, though, I still liked the show.",1318982400,5,342,4.483870967741935
4984020,1,B006DVB5XQ,What happened to Earth Final Conflict?  Where did it go?  This season is a very sad and desperate grasp at keeping the storyline going but fails miserably.  The series was wonderful through season 4.  They should have ended it with season 4.  This is pretty much a waste of money and a kill-joy.,1295654400,8,295,4.490566037735849
8496755,1,B006DVB5XQ,"This was a disappointment, considering it came from Gene Roddenberry. The acting was awful, and the plot had some promise early on, but in the end, it was just some mish-mash of bad aliens who go away and are replaced by even ""badder"" aliens who all had their hair done in some LA primo hairstylist's salon. Even the two female leads (in the final season (oh yeah, I watched it all) kept having new hairdos, even though they were fighting for truth, justice, and the American way. Nothing original here & I see why Roddenberry didn't produce it while he was alive. Ugh.",1529884800,,569,4.533980582524272

8496761,4,B006DVB5XQ,"Writers/Producers take risks, and they certainly did with the fifth season.  While most people agree it was the least entertaining of the five seasons, I think the (virtual) absence of the Taelons, the introduction of the Atavus, and having only one original cast member on-contract forced the writers to be more creative with plot lines and guest roles.  Cameos by the likes of Kevin Kilner and Robert Leeshock helped.",1495497600,,419,5.057971014492754
