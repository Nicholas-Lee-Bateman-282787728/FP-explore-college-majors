5407776,1,B00AATV0SW,I had terrible luck with this DVD.  Twas the Night before Easter was actually not even on the DVD.  Instead the commentary played.  I checked out the commentary thinking maybe the tracks were just mixed up.  They were not.  I returned it and ordered a replacement.  The same thing happened.

5407784,5,B00AATV0SW,"My children loved the easter stories.  I wasn't sure about the song collection.  The selections on the first cd are for children and not for adults, but all my children under ten love them.  The child over ten prefers the second cd, but doesn't care for the first cd.  The first cd is a story of a sunday school on easter day and lessons are taught with song.  A silly song is included.
