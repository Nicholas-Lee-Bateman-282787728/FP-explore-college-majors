I have seen every film based upon Great Expectations, and this meticulously crafted film is the only one that does justice to the structure and intention of the book. The attention to the plot, characterization, and settings of the book is astonishingly precise; and, considering the great proportions of the book, Disney's rendering is the only one that is intellectually honest. Spot-on performances abound: John-Rhys-Davies as a true ""Hercules of weakness and strength,"" Joe Gargery; Anthony Hopkins as the generous ""convict,"" Abel Magwich; Jean Simmons as the embittered Miss Havisham (one remembers her as Estella in the 1946 version); I could go on and on: leave it to say that every single performance is ""real."" The script has been written with novel-in-hand (and I would not mention it, if it were not for the fact that every other version of this film seems to avoid the language of Dickens in favor of some travestied Modern English).

 And speaking of travesties, imagine this: the PBS ""Masterpiece"" versions alone omit Biddy from the whole film altogether, thereby destroying a critical plot line.  The ""Masterpiece"" versions are in fact masterpieces of misreading--in fact, virtually every character (and relationship) is so misread, one wonders if the director, producer, screenwriter, and cast had even read the book!  But then there is this Disney film that is so astonishingly truthful that one is carried away, into the book. Nothing essential is left out.  Nothing.",1352505600,,1561,5.199203187250996

7902121,5,B0000022LO,"I am a Dickens fan, having read ALMOST every book several times. I have watched all the Great Expectations movies, and felt this one expresses the very heart and soul of Dickens more than any other. Why O Why is this still a VHS? As the years pass I know there is less hope of Disney ever getting it to DVD. Walt requested the Hall of Presidents to always remain on Main Street Disneyland. There were values he wished to affirm. I think this movie holds much of what he would have approved and enjoyed. I think he would have wanted this movie to remain available to all and not slide out of reach with the passing of VHS. And no, I do not think the movie was too long. (Of course, who am I? I thought ""Lord of the Rings"" was too short.) I felt Pip's time spent in the world of wealth was dearly needed to explain his absolute loss of tolerance for poor Joe. A change of that sort, like hardening of the arteries, just doesn't happen overnight. Herbert Pocket was delightful to know, as was meeting Wemmick who was kind and even playful with his aging parent. It made Pip's rejection of his own more pointed. I enjoyed Estella's development as well, under her bitterest of tutors. The final exposure of Mr. Magwhich's humanity, his deepest secret, was excellently portrayed. I don't see what should have been removed. I would wish it to remain as produced.",1191110400,,1355,4.424
7902122,4,B0000022LO,"This is a made-for-TV film of ""Great Expectations,"" one of the best novels Charles Dickens wrote.  The film was first televised on 24-26 July, 1989, in USA as a Disney Channel product (in fact, Disney was responsible for half of the financing of the film), and it stars Anthony Calf as Pip, and Kim Thompson as Estella.  But it is Anthony Hopkins as Magwitch who steals the show (no wonder, of course).  He was soon to be known as 'Lector' as you know, but he had been already known as an immensely talented actor then, and you will know why.
The script follows the original faithfully, but not as faithfully you might think.  The director Kevin Conner (who directed ""The Old Curiosty Shop"" 6 years later) not only includes every major episode from the book -- which means, you see even 'Avenger' a valet Pip employs -- but also Mr. Conner adds some shots that are not in the original.  So, you will meet good-natured Biddy BEFORE you meet haughty Estella, and you see the Avenger's role unexpectedly enlarged.  But as a whole, the story can be called intact.
The production designs are good, but just good.  Some complained when it was released that they are too clean (remember, it's Disney!), and I must say there are some truths in that opinion.  You will find Wemmick's 'Castle' (which comes even with a cannon), but it looks like an amusement park to me.  Not a big problem, but probably they should not take Dickens's world too literally.  The shots are well done, above average photography.
As I said, Anthony Hopkins is great, but as you know his role is not a big one; Jean Simmons (who was young Estella in David Lean version ) has come back to ""Great Expectations"" as Miss Havisham, and her credible presence justifies this rather unique casting.  Also great is Joe Gargery by John Rhys Davies.  He is perhaps the only actor who looks like this hen-pecked and kind-hearted blacksmith.  Unfortunately, Pip and Estella are not so effective as they are, not least because the two Estellas (young and old) are played by the same person.  This unaccountable casting (which was also done in Michael York version) only detracts our attention, and never works.
The film is very long (more than 300 minutes), and perjaps too long, I am afraid.  It spends too much time on descriptions about Pip's life as gentleman (the least interesting part of the book) when it should go faster.  (And the film shows Matthew Pocket holding his front hair as the book describes, but do we need to see it?)  Still, this version is a good one especially for family viewing.",1075248000,4,2559,4.651111111111111
7902123,5,B0000022LO,"This is definitely the BEST version available of Dickens' Great Expectations.  Since this version, originally made for British tv, is 5-1/2 hours long, it provides an essentially unabridged video rendition of Dickens' masterpiece. The acting, directing, and cinematography are all top-notch.  Jean Simmons, who played the young Estella in the 1946 version, plays Miss Havisham.",977702400,4,377,5.836363636363636
