5008400,4,B006NVZMSK,"Having lived through the era that had people like Silk Smitha working off the casting couch, it was a revelation to see it recreated so well in this movie. It would be naive to assume that the world of glamour and glitter that is the film industry is without exploitation of women, especially those that are driven by ambition and couldn't care less what they have to do to achieve their dreams. This is a story of a lamb who goes to the slaughter quite willingly. It also brings home the point that at least in Bollywood it has always been a man's world.

Vidya Balan turns in a stellar performance, transforming herself as the movie goes along. The scene in the porn studio is particularly poignant. Naseeruddin Shah is great as always, looks and fits the part. The songs and sets are OTT as they used to be, particularly in the South-Indian movies.

Not the usual Bollywood fare and definitely worth watching.",1354147200,,912,4.588957055214724

5008402,4,B006NVZMSK,"You know how actors are always humming about getting a dream role and playing it to the best of their ability? Usually such roles go by somewhat under-celebrated by the audiences. The artist who plays these roles love their personal performances but seldom does a moment come for an actor where the rejoice of the crowd is matched equivocally with their own candor. Vidya Balan completely owned her role in THE DIRTY PICTURE. The film is a treat for film goers and the direction is stoic and lacks any apology or even malice. This will be a favorite for many years to come for several dialogues. I think Vidya Balan's performance dictates the flow of the film  and she has truly outdone any expectation anyone had from her. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and for people who thought it was vulgar or silly, they surely weren't expecting a Priyadarshanisque flair now, were they?! I'm going to watch Kahaani at the theater too, it was a recently released film and I hear it's yet another rollicker by this actor who's risen from the phoenix of her own lukewarm ashes.",1331424000,4,1064,4.659574468085107
5008403,4,B006NVZMSK,"Don't we all love our flawed entertainers, in most cases the more depraved and shocking an actors life is, the more curiosity we have for that star. In most cases a star maybe doing it for attention or sensation but many times, their lives are emotionally bankrupt which make them fall in to an abyss. Ektaa Kapoor chooses Silk Smitha, the titillating sensation of the 80's, as her subject for Dirty Picture. The film chronicles her life, detailing her long struggles, her sexual escapades with men, her fame, her bouts with alcohol, her botched attempt in film production which made her penniless, and finally the emergence of the heroine as the vamp and which relegated the likes of Silk to the background. She and Milan Luthria the director, pack all this in slighly over 2.30 hours sheer entertainment.
Reshma ( Vidya Balan) aspires to be a actress but does not get any breaks, and she is told that she does not have the spice or spunk to light up the screen. However she manages to land a role as a dancer in a film by Selva Ganesh ( Rajesh Sharma) which has been directed by artsy Abraham (Emraan Hashmi) However her sequence ends up on the editing floor. Selvaganesh finds that footage and releases the film, instant fame follows with a rechristening from Reshma to Silk. Silk then gets a chance to act with Surya ( Naseeruddin Shah) and uses her charms to land him in bed. This scene is amazing because of the dialogue,Surya tells Silk `Main 500 ladkiyon ke saath tuning kar chuka hu', ( I have tuned 500 women) to which she replies `Par kya aapne ek ladki ke saath 500 baar tune kiya hai ( but have you slept with the same woman 500 times) They have an affair but since Surya is married, Silk remains the other woman. Two more men enter Silk's life Ramakant ( Tushaar Kapoor) and Abraham, the man who hates her the most. The film documents her rise and rise and fall.
This film has easily one of the most wittiest and well written script of 2011, Rajat Arora has penned the script and almost every second line is a classic. The dialogue elevates the story to monumental heights and is matched by very good direction by Milan Luthria.
The movie belongs to Vidya Balan, who has redefined her image and got in to the character called Silk. As an Indian Anna Nicole Smith sort of character, Ms Balan slips in to this role with complete ease, displaying an equal combination of raunchiness and innocence via the minuscule clothing, with the more than ample lard or through her naughty smile, she electrifies the entire film. A fitting closure to a year that began with `No one killed Jessica `in January. Award Panelists will have a hard time deciding which performance should be awarded. I say, give her two prizes for best acting.
The film making of the 80's has been captured well and highlights the crudeness of that age, the songs magnify it. Watch Ooh La La, and notice the novel use of oranges and lemons in cinema of that era. Music is ear pleasing, I preferred the tune Ishq Sufiaana.
Overall a great film, with great acting and brilliant dialogue writing. Easily one of the best films of the year. 4 stars. 12/2/2011",1324684800,10,3130,4.561278863232682

8501489,2,B006NVZMSK,"This DVD is loaded with ads. The DVD is manufactured in such a way that once the ads start, you cannot do anything to skip them. Wow! And when the ads were done, there was no movie. I tried hard to reload. But the same incident repeated itself whenever I tried. I wanted to ask the seller to return my money, but it is not worth the while. And I think that, on account of this, customers do not complain and these DVDs keep on selling and fooling EVERY buyer. If the seller did not know this, they should re-check, and perhaps take this product off  the Amazon.com market.",1411344000,,572,4.247706422018348

8501494,3,B006NVZMSK,"The parody on South Indian movie business is nicely done, even though it mostly looks like North India (read Mumbai/Bollywood): Balan and Shah play drastically comical, the song Oh la la is a mean attack on your dance muscles and furiously picturised to boot.

But the second half gets serious and dramatic, and here Dirty Picture falters. The tragedy seems unconvincing, and the dialogue sounded all to contrived and filmi right from the beginning. There's a lot of kitsch without creating empathy and the ending can be guessed from afar.

With a coy smile the producers assure us that the movie just depicts the tragic life of one certain South Indian actress. But just take a look: Vidya Balan  in a surprising detour from previous roles  shakes, moans and flashes in a way the riksha wallas and tea boys on the cheap front seats rarely get to savour. According to Wikipedia, Indian TV showed this movie only after 11 p.m. even though 54 pieces of the theatrical release were removed.

Bollywood produced a lot of Bollywood parodies (yes, Dirty Picture aims at Tollywood, but still). In somes scenes, Dirty Picture clearly reminded me of the 2007 smash hit Om Shanti Om (but done on a smaller budget). Both movies have similar sounding music too  which comes as no surprise, as in both cases Vishal-Shekar contributed the tunes.",1361923200,,1331,4.841409691629956
8501495,5,B006NVZMSK,"I am slowly learning to truly appreciate foriegn films. I am quite enamored with Indian movies. I love the music, costumes and the very LOW AMOUNT amount of violence and gore. This film was based on one of the first females to do any form of erotica. She opened the doors for that XXX world in Indian films. This film was able to convey the story without nudity, vulgar sex scenes, ranchy non-talented porn stars. It took very talented and attractive actors and creative staff to tell an interesting story, VERY well!!!! The music was just grand! I was very impressed at how neutral this topic was handled. Not for kids or young teens.",1356134400,,635,4.578947368421052
