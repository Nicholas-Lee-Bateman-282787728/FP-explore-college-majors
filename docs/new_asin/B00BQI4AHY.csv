5665933,4,B00BQI4AHY,"I have to admit that the idea of a documentary on eels kind of freaked me out! We picked it because it was only an hour long and the preview looked pretty (and because he likes eels way more than I do). The cinematography is beautiful and the information really fascinating. That having been said, the artist/writer guy who's the storytelling vessel and narrator sounds like a school kid being forced to read aloud in class. Neither of us liked his narration style, so it is a testament to the stunning visuals and information that we watched the whole thing and enjoyed it.",1404950400,5,574,4.58252427184466

5665935,2,B00BQI4AHY,"NATURE: The Mystery of Eels 55 minutes; 2013

While many recent NATURE programs have been more travelogue than science, this video disappoints by being disorganized, leaving out much science, and even questioning the value of  science.

The program is narrated by its producer. The absence of a professional narrator is noticeable from the beginning and provides an unevenness throughout the program. There are only a few segments of this hour-long program that are useful in a science class and a teacher would do well to turn off the sound and narrate it.

While the first eels breed in the Atlantic and the Japanese and New Zealand species breed somewhere in the Pacific, this major partition will not be recognized unless a teacher points it out. After a brief worldwide summary, the first episode begins in the Catskills showing eel fishing using a V-shaped river weir to collect eels as they return to the ocean to spawn.  There is a lack of science perspective or need to explicate, no clear distinction that only a few fish can make this transition between the salty oceans and the freshwater streams.  Anadromous fishes such as salmon grow up in the ocean and migrate from the ocean into fresh water to spawn and die upstream.  Eels are catadromous fishes that  migrate from fresh water into the sea to spawn and die, and young return to freshwater to grow up. Not only does this video avoid those terms, it leaves viewers clueless on the overall pattern of fish life history and the major stresses and physiological adaptations that must be made.

It shows the hot smoking of eels for food, the migratory dangers, and the larval eels (elvers, another term not used) with a dorso-ventrally flattened body shape. The Sargasso Sea that is a kelp region in the Atlantic is mentioned but not described. The mention that eels migrate the opposite of ...every other fish is wrong. The possible use of magnetite for navigation is briefly speculated. The eel gold rush is well explained, contrasting the early times with the current markets in Asia and the massive Chinese fish farms.

The narrative is interspersed with the narrators personal story of discovering Japanese art and using ink and dead eels to form a large print artwork, which develops throughout the program.  While tuna is Japans #1 fish, eels come in at #3 in popularity. Eel processing is shown, indicating their use in Asian medicine and as a source of vitamins. In Japan, eels are a seasonal diet, equivalent to the Western hot dog. Japan eel farming is briefly shown (useful in biology classes). Attempts have been made to artificially spawn eels in the lab since 1970s but without great success. The search for the Pacific spawning grounds (the equivalent of the Sargasso Sea) is briefly mentioned as likely the West Mariana Reach, along with the compulsory retirement of a Japanese eel researcher. The narrator indicates that the earth was at one time one giant land mass called Pangaeatrue, but it was surrounded by a huge ocean.  In the last 200 million years, 16 species of freshwater eels have evolved.  Much of the last half of the video is spent in New Zealand following the long fin eels at 7 feet and 60 pounds. This species, when tagged, appears to spawn in the South Fiji Basin.

However, a big minus for this program is the anti-science attitude, first expressed in describing the Maori tribe relationship with eels. New Zealand history included introducing trout and killing the eel as a trout predator. Current tribal trapping is shown. Good footage shows the eels spinning to tear off food. There is a brief return to Maine to show the beginning of an eel run. The Maori harvest eels during migration across the beach. Eel mythology and cultural entanglements are discussed. The New Zealand hydroelectric dams posed a major obstacle and took a toll on populations, not on the young eels going upstream but on adults going downstream.  Eel conservation efforts are underway. Much of the last narrative drifts into platitudes and concludes by again stating that we might be better off not knowing the eels biology and that there are ...some things that we don't understand and maybe we don't need to.  Such an anti-science and anti-intellectual ending is sad for a series that runs on PBS.",1394496000,17,4277,4.870523415977962

Some biki-clad hippie chick petting eels to the sounds of clich&eacute; poetry and new age tones that the filmmaker surely traded screentime for sexual favors to was the last straw.

5666038,3,B00BQI4AHY,"New Age. Anti-science. Should be banned in school. I must say that the negative reactions of the other reviewers piqued my interest in this production, The Mystery of Eels. I agree that it's rather boring, and that it's probably unsuited for a strictly scientific TV channel like the PBS. However, it's not completely under the water either.

Rather than a real documentary about the fish known as eel, it narrates the movie-maker's personal journey across the globe in search of harmony between spirit, man and nature. He interviews traditional fishermen (and women) in New England, explores nature-oriented Japanese art, and visits the Maori in New Zealand. For once, bad modern civilization is symbolized by contemporary Japan rather than the West, as the narrator takes us on a tour through mechanized fish markets, fish farms and restaurants. As for the eel, it's used throughout as a symbol for the spiritual dimension we have to reconnect with.

Even as a work of poetry, I'd say The mystery of the eel is mostly a failure, but it might be of some interest if the romantic-Green angle is your thing. Although I feel less romantic (and slightly hungrier) today, I will nevertheless give this production three stars for the effort.",1430611200,,1236,4.995145631067961

I am amazed by their complexity. I really hope that we invest more in basic sciences so we can learn more about eels and nature in general.

It is still interesting why growing eels in a lab doesn't work so well. Maybe it has to do with composition of the seawater?

Just so much to learn and they are so delicious ^^

Quick update: Experiment.com is raising funding for California Moray Eel. There has not been much research done on these eels. It would be great if we could support this research so we can understand eels and marine ecology better.

This documentary is a welcome moment of humility in the endless torrent of pop-science hubris that's been coming at us since Wild Kingdom. This time, a mindful citizen speaks about a natural lifecycle with respect and awe, instead of the compulsive reductive analysis that usually only results in exhaustive labeling. If the scientific method ruled our relationship with nature, we would not have global warming or the ever-declining salmon populations after 100 years of human ""assistance"".  It's true that our depredations can be seen and mitigations begun through science but that is not enough.
We will not re-assume a sustainable role in nature, it's too late. Every time we uncover her secrets, our Western compulsion will be to exploit. Therefore, I share the mistrust of the filmmaker and hope that we don't solve this particular mystery.

Who would want to watch a video on eels? Mostly people who love nature and animals, I would think. I'm one of those people but I don't think James Prosek is. There are a lot of shots of eels being hurt or killed like it's nothing. Like they are automatons without the ability to feel pain. But I believe they do feel pain so I had to turn this off.

More and more nature films concentrate on the terrible parts of the lives of animals like it's nothing. Even great nature films made by wonderful photographers. They will concentrate on the animals suffering and death, or on the suffering and death they cause. I'm not asking for a Disney film from 50 years ago, but the lives of animals surely include more than suffering and death. Some days I think this is a plot to make people not love nature or animals, to not sympathize with them and want nature protected and preserved. So they show us a hundred shots of animals being killed to every one of them living their lives, socializing, mating or caring for their young. If something terrible is part of their life cycle, you can just tell me. You don't have to linger in closeup at the pain.

Also I think sometimes the photographer is morally obligated to intervene. If a lion is killing a gazelle, you can't take sides because the other side will die. But when, for instance, chicks are being killed by their parents, time to rescue them. Instead, the cold hearted photographers will linger on the suffering.

So I can't watch and wish I was there to help the suffering animal.",1407024000,,1566,4.484210526315789

8572518,1,B00BQI4AHY,"It was just dreary.  Very light on science, very heavy on blood and how horrible humanity is.",1528416000,,93,4.470588235294118
8572519,2,B00BQI4AHY,"Eels are bad, mkay. Or, you can see how fishing can be sustainable if you don't watch this at all.",1528243200,,98,3.95
8572520,1,B00BQI4AHY,The narration was not good. Very hard to listen to. Couldnt finish watching. Too annoying.,1527465600,,90,5.066666666666666
8572521,3,B00BQI4AHY,Very good camera shots and calming visual flow. Tina Belchers first break in to narration goes largely unnoticed.,1513641600,,113,5.333333333333333
8572522,4,B00BQI4AHY,Good movie. I just wish wish wish I had the sound track. Its so good!!,1502668800,,70,3.7333333333333334
8572523,1,B00BQI4AHY,This DVD includes scenes of catching and preparing eel for human consumption. It was definitely not the nature program I was looking forward to sharing with my soon to be four year old grandson who loves eels (and all other water creatures).,1493769600,,241,4.761904761904762
8572524,2,B00BQI4AHY,"I'm sure its fascinating, but I only lasted 10 minutes because the dude sounded like someone who doesn't speak english sitting in an english language class and trying the best he possibly can to read something in english, but can't really because he's reading about eels and can't be comfortable with the topic enough to connect with it probably thinking it was some sort of cultural eel thing he will never understand, and so he's hoping the teacher will stop him and call on someone else, but she won't because she's hungover and could care less whats going on in the class, and he knows this,  but he reluctantly reads on while moving his fingers along the page like he's reading braille, but he's not, he can see, he's just reading english, poorly, but not because he can't, he's a smart person, but because the words are nothing but just words, and he's starting to think english speaking people must really like eels, but he only joined the class to learn to speak english, and now he's thinking he might be in a little over his head.",1488931200,,1040,4.561497326203209
8572525,5,B00BQI4AHY,"First saw this program on PBS and immediately knew we wanted to add a copy to our home DVD collection.  Although I've never seen an eel, viewing this DVD shows how fascinating their lives are and how important eels are as a food source.",1476576000,,236,4.363636363636363
8572526,1,B00BQI4AHY,"This isn't so much about eels as it is about an artist seeking to get in tough with eels on an almost spiritual level. There are some interesting parts but I was very glad for the fast forward on my Fire TV remote. The best way I can describe this is ""self indulgent"". It's not about you, the viewer.",1467676800,,300,4.101694915254237
