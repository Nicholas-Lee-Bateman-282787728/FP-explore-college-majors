6819409,1,B00PMT1CEW,"This person was obviously another NWO sort who deviated too far from the agenda--and was slapped on the nose for it.

 If he had not resigned from the IMF, his accuser would have been found to have made valid accusations.

Whether he wished to shake up the IMF rules or not is up to debate. To believe in any headlines of any sort, especially as they relate to anyone of great power is odd these days. I don't believe anyone still does.

This film is out to jovialize his behaviors, jovialize the incident so the public does not examine his behavior and the entitlement that allows it. Rather like the Kate and Will saga or the film about the stuttering prince, the media has lesser magically transformed a malevolent bunch.",1428624000,2,724,4.546153846153846

6819411,4,B00PMT1CEW,"Based on the true life accusation of rape that Dominic Straus-Kahn was charged with, this finds Gerard Depardieu playing one of his most challenging roles. He plays a powerful French man in the World of finance - Devereaux. He is a hedonistic auteur of a man given to wanton lust and high life depravity in all its forms.

He even has business meetings where `working girls' are available for - quite literally - `executive relief'. Then he has some Bacchanalian orgy in his five star hotel room and wakes up in need of some more action. Luckily housekeeping is there to do her thing and he decides she must be on his libido menu too and so goes for it. What follows includes the police reaction and what followed in the media circus. His wife is played by Jacqueline Bisset who tries to guide him through the mire of a sex scandal.

This is a film that will put some people off. The sex scenes do seem to be a bit drawn out, he is a nymphomaniac, and we get that pretty early one - the need for drawn out bedroom grunting is therefore questionable and could be classed as border line porn. The issues around privilege and power and the abuse of both are left for the viewer to decide. The naked greed is likewise shown as being incidental to the whole way of life of these people who seem to think they are untouchable.

It is a very well made film, the performances are excellent and Depardieu is just brilliant in that you forget who he is and assume he is the on screen persona- mind you he is nearly always good. Not a film for everyone and painful to watch in places but still an above average cinematic experience.",1417824000,9,1621,4.360927152317881
6819412,4,B00PMT1CEW,"This film is a fictional retelling/ docudrama of the Dominique Struass-Kahn rape accusation by a New York maid in 2011. The film changes the names and adds fictionalized dramatic personal details as we see the wife (Jacqueline Bisset) upset that the case ruined HER ambitions and life. Good dramatic performances. Not a court room drama.

We are introduced to the party lifestyle of Devereaux (G&eacute;rard Depardieu) and after about 30 minutes we have an arrest. Much of the drama consists of the discussion between him and his wife. A good portion of the film is in French.

Good drama. Front loaded nudity. 3 1/2 stars

6819414,4,B00PMT1CEW,"Abel Ferraras thinly veiled account of the alleged sexual assault of an immigrant chambermaid by French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn is an intriguing, if not particularly powerful, docudrama. Its not easy to be repulsed by a hedonistic, unrepentant rich man when hes portrayed by an actor as charming as Gerard Depardieu. But its always fascinating to see how the worlds elite behave and misbehave  whether or not that behavior is real or the product of a screenwriters imagination.

6819419,5,B00PMT1CEW,"If the saga of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French high official caught up in a messy, sordid sex scandal in 2011, had never happened, Hollywood or Paris (this is a joint US - French production) would have easily dreamed it up. And so enters this movie, a fictionalized account of the DSK affair (no pun intended), portraying the life and travails of Mr. Devereaux, a high French official with a ribald disposition and a seemingly insatiable appetite.

The story has all the elements of a compelling political thriller   prestigious government official with an illustrious past, allegations of sexual misconduct, clashing egos, drama, conflicting stories, spurned spouse, and intrigue. It is above all the portrait of a sex addict, depicted in graphic, sordid, and yet, surprisingly, ultimately sympathetic details.

And the movie delivers. If it is possible to convey the life of a sex addict in a tasteful way, the director, Abel Ferrara, does it. Devereaux moves from one playful encounter to another, until, that is, he meets his match. The charges against the real-life DSK were dismissed amid questions on the victims credibility and rumors of conspiracy, while for Devereaux the reasons are more ambiguous. The wife of DSK stood by her man, at least publically, while Mrs. Devereaux would have her husband to rot in jail.

There are also few actors working today who could have so convincingly portrayed the larger-than-life person of DSK than Gerard Depardieu. Not only does he still have an incredible screen presence shared by few other actors, but Depardieu also conveys DSKs physical girth and colossal ego with pathos. Depardieu was born to play this role and delivers his best performance in years. Jacqueline Bisset as well delivers a gut-wrenching performance as DSK-Devereauxs spurned wife.

A parental advisory here, there are numerous sex scenes in this movie. While they are graphic they are tastefully done and not in the plot to merely to titillate the viewer, but are necessary to the story to depict the debauchery of Devereauxs lifestyle.

This movie is a commentary as much of DSK-Devereaux as the country in which he was arrested. From the wry rendition of America the Beautiful in the opening credits, to the ironic title of this film, the movie expertly contrasts the highs and lows of NYC, from Devereauxs jet-setting high life to the cold realities of the New York City jail and criminal system.

While there are no redeeming qualities to Devereauxs personal life, the viewer is ultimately left feeling some remorse to the life he leads. He is trapped in a marriage without tenderness or affection, a result of his own misconduct as much to the personality of his spouse (Jacqueline Bisset). His lifestyle has alienated the affection of his daughter, who strives to find a normal life. It is implied that Devereaux once held lofty ideals, but those ideals were apparently lost over the years, to have Devereaux comment in the latter part of the film that he believes ""in nothing. His world is jaded, cynical and empty. So he fills it with kinky sex parties.

The US release has almost twenty minutes edited from the original version. No doubt many of the sex scenes ended up on the editing floor. This is a crime matching Devereauxs. Do yourself a favor and purchase the unedited European version from Amazon UK and enjoy this challenging yet highly recommended film.",1437350400,7,3397,5.00886524822695

A bit disclosing a very core of a possibility to gain and secure deployment at international organizations particularly, Depardieu adds a personal touch to this reality of hardcore protectionism by visualizing disgust at a sex-obsessed elitist flock celebrating own living on very poverty and misery a dominant number of folks subsists worldwide in.
Also it's unclear, whether Gerald D. was still new Russian citizen at the time of this movie-making, but a message sent by this R-rated work is profoundly sharp.",1461024000,4,683,5.452830188679245
