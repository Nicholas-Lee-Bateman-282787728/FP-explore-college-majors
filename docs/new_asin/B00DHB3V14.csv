5798472,5,B00DHB3V14,One of best shows on tv with big bang  cant wait to get my hands on that dvd ! Hope for many more sesons,1400976000,3,104,3.3333333333333335
5798473,5,B00DHB3V14,"*  I watched all episodes form March 2013 - Wed 5/21/14 (Season 5 final episode)

* I found out about MODERN FAMILY in March 2013 when a relative was in the hospital. It became a bright light in my life and I credit it for helping me through a tough month. I haven't watched half hour sitcoms since That 70's Show went off the air.

*The show has such a consistent cast, everyone is essential to it and no one holds all the power like in most sitcoms.

* With good writing it can go 10 seasons if it want, maybe more.

* They need to do a vacation show YEARLY and for 2 episodes. Season 5's 1 episode Australia trip was too short, it needed to
  be 2 episodes.

* With the kids getting older the show needs to become a little more ""edgier and rough"" then it will survive to a season
  10 or more.

*I know people who won't watch it because there are ""gays"" in it.... they're missing out. These 2 guys are funny as hell especially when you realize Eric Stonestreet isn't even gay and Jesse Tyler Ferguson is plain and simple a good actor.

I have seen many of the episodes 5-7 times, I conclude that:
1). Any comedy where you watch the REPEATS over and over is a good comedy.
2). Any comedy that has literally 50-100 LAUGH POINTS per 1/2 hour episode is UNBELIEVABLE.
3). Any comedy that has at least q person you identify with a lot can be a good comedy.
4). Any comedy that has such a consistent and stable cast can be one of the best comedies of all time (IF THEY
  STAY TOGETHER). hopefully the cast will stay together.

Remember That 70's show, it started to be not as good when Eric Foreman and Kelso left, etc.....i'd hate to see Modern Family start losing case members....but I don't think they will.

I would like to see this show have a slight improvement in the writing and run another 4-6 years and go out a winner, which is what I think will happen.

ENJOY your MOFY

5798495,1,B00DHB3V14,"Was going to buy all seasons (bought season 2 and season 3 recently) BEFORE finding out they quit blurays on season 5.  This happened with bluray release of Little House on the Prairie, BUT they changed their mind due to customer complaints and released last three seasons which were already remastered in high-def before bluray relase.  My favorite show is The Big Bang Theory, they know how to do it the right way.  They just released previous season a week before new season airs, allowing me to binge watch the previous season so I'm ready for next season premiere.  Modern Family has won awards and SHOULD have every season on bluray, shame on whoever is preventing it.  Amazon, please listen to customers giving one star and lean on them to release blurays.  Maybe it could be a manufacture on demand???

AT LEAST, amazon could put warning on modern family season 1-4 bluray pages that 5+ on bluray is not an option.  Look after your customers, not studio/television execs.",1474070400,,979,4.785714285714286

5798510,5,B00DHB3V14,"I love ""Modern Family,"" but after reading all the negative reviews regarding the blurry quality of the season five DVDs, I was apprehensive about ordering. However, since there are so many outstanding episodes in season five (especially ""Larry's Wife"" and ""Under Pressure""), I had to take a chance and order. I'm not disappointed. The DVD's look as great as the other ""Modern Family"" DVDs; not blurry at all. I noticed that most of the complaints occurred a few years ago. Perhaps the first batch of season five DVDs were bad and after numerous complaints the problem was fixed.",1461715200,,578,4.908163265306122

It's truly appalling that they didn't create a hi-definition DVD, PARTICULARLY because they chose not to offer Blu-Ray.

5798580,3,B00DHB3V14,"The show itself is still great.  It does, in some ways, feel like a sitcom that has been on the air for a while, but they have been able to keep the show as fresh as a longer running sitcom can be.  This was done by doing a Cam and Mitchell engagement to wedding story arc throughout the season.  As in past seasons it does a good job giving all the characters stories, but there are times when the kids were kind of relegated to the background.

As has been the case in prior seasons there were on location episodes.  This time one in Vegas and one in Australia.  The final two episodes of the season focused on the wedding day, and had the somewhat predicable disasters that almost ruined the day, but with everything being okay in the end.  They did get a little over the top and repetitive with the almost cancelling and moving the wedding, but by the end it was a funny and touching episode.

For those who actually get the discs, the quality is very sub par.  First of all, after making the first 4 seasons available on blu-ray, the studio completely went the cheap route and made it only available on DVD, which many of the non-CGI heavy shows are doing.  Although Modern Family is still popular enough that it should have still been available on blu-ray.  Then to add insult to injury, the DVD transfer is horrible.  Unfortunately fox has focused far more on streaming their shows and made the physical media almost an afterthought.  On top of all that, there are very few extras.  Deleted scenes on disc 2, then a couple behind the scenes features on the location episode, a couple featurettes on the wedding episode, and a gag reel.  Okay for what is there, but not as much or as quality as in the past.",1436572800,2,1713,4.393650793650794

While the season does not deliver the consistent laughs of other seasons, it is still funnier than most shows on television.  The season revolves around the planning for and the wedding of Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet). There is also a trip with the entire family to Australia.  While this is the main storyline, the real star of the season is Ty Burrell as Phil.  He constantly is saying things that make his look like a fool and the physical comedy he shows between getting smashed in the face again with a radio controlled airplane, stung by a jellyfish, having an allergic reaction to vegemite and getting punched in the face by a kangaroo will have you rolling on the floor in hysterics.  He won a second and well deserved Emmy for the season.  Another big change is that Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) start high school and both of their voices have changed.  Luke's change is much more drastic and some of the things he does aren't as cute in a growing teen as they were when he was younger.  Overall, there are some bunker episodes in the season, but the show still elicits major laughs.",1423353600,,1248,4.666666666666667

The playback quality is absolutely terrible. Everything is fuzzy looking and is equivalent to about 480 (VHS) quality, even on a player that has upscaling. I compared this season to an older season of modern family just to make sure I hadn't gotten too used to HD quality, but it is was night a day difference. The picture quality of the old season was MUCH more clear. I don't know if they messed up during video transfer or did something to prevent HDMI players from upscaling the content, but it is terrible.

Yes, I love watching modern family and still enjoyed the season, but the poor video quality is very distracting. Had I known just how bad the playback quality was going to be, I would have waited to see if they sold a blu-ray version later on. Now I know, trust the negative reviews when they complain about poor video quality.

This has been decried over and over, so I won't belabor the point.

However, I will say that the transfer on the DVD is NOT that bad and honestly on par with previous DVD seasons (I own the others on DVD too). Saying it's ""worse than VHS"" is incredibly hyperbolic. To me, it seems pretty standard for a DVD. I buy Blu-ray when possible, but I still have a lot of DVDs that I watch on my HDTV, and I have many (particularly older) DVDs that are worse quality than this. Ignore the negative reviews...just buy the DVD when the price drops, and you may sadly have to accept the fact that Blu-ray is on the decline as a format, thanks to streaming. Movies continue to be released on Blu-ray it seems, but Modern Family is just the latest example of TV shows that are DVD or streaming only. DVD is on the decline too, but needless to say, DVD has quite a stronghold on the market and it won't be going anywhere for a while.

This season is as great as ever and I think I enjoy each season more upon multiple viewings. One of the best comedies on TV; it may lack depth, but to me it's on par with The Office or The Simpsons, neither of which have much depth either. It's just fun TV.",1419552000,2,1510,4.313380281690141

Even though we get our bunch of laughs, some scenes in some episodes were like watching Seth MacFarlane stuff .  Throwing pasta on each other's faces is not the kind of laughs I expect, and this TV series have so far avoided.

But you know what? The comedy is as sharp and crisp as ever. Just like the four seasons before this one, I had some laugh-out-loud moments that probably scared the crap out of my dog and cat.

This blended family is often full of missteps yet in the end they are a true loving family--the kind many of wish we had. SEASON 5 does not disappoint. Much of Season 5 centers around Cam and Mitchell's upcoming wedding. They've been together 10 years and have an adopted daughter and finally gay marriage is legal in California. Of course, nothing is ever simple or easy with this family.
The entire cast continues to be phenomenal. I enjoy everyone but I think I often get a kick out of Nolan Gould as teenage Luke Dunphy. There is just something about his deadpan delivery and clueless antics that are spot on and hilarious. Of course, everyone in this cast is a delight and don't forget the guest stars including Nathan Lane as Pepper, the wedding planner.
The clan heads to Australia for one fun filled episode. The only thing to ponder is why are they in Australia for just one episode?

It's worse than VHS quality on our flat screen and FYI, this is coming from a family that doesn't even watch or own blu ray DVDs.

It is just not as funny as it once was. This season is especially disappointing with unfunny scripts and the actors just going through the motions. The Phil character is a buffoon. I know kids grow up but in this case it has changed the whole dynamic of the show. What was once cute and funny is now boring. The new season now being broadcast doesn't show any signs of improvement. In the first three seasons it was funny with great writing and the actors portrayed their characters with enthusiasm.

I own all previous seasons in DVD format and this Season 5 Set is not of the same quality as the releases for Seasons 1-4.  it's a shame that they released this without correcting it, but I guess when studios are only interested in the bottom line and not the quality of their product, decisions like this get made...",1412467200,110,1206,4.534562211981567

They have a hard edge. They are super fast-paced, and so lose appreciation time; as if they need to cram in all the words, but the words are not that interesting.

This series used to be witty, employ irony, comment on current-day foibles that families encounter. This series employs slapstick, and uses low jokes of the kind in which individuals are so afaid of being honest the plot consists of their tying themselves up in contrived knots trying to get out of the mess they made. And this isn't funny. Indeed, it's reminiscent of '60s and '70s sitcoms which rarely had witty social commentary but were directed at the lowest common denominator.

The last two episodes, of getting the two men married, is an example of that. It is as if the writers (and maybe the actors?) are tired of the whole thing.

Just seems odd that a copy would elect to change course mid stream.",1411257600,12,607,4.4324324324324325
5798767,5,B00DHB3V14,"The new(extended) American television family is here and guess what their not perfect. Heck there not even close. The show is groundbreaking because it gives us a real glimpse of America. And guess what it's way different than the sit coms of old. There's no perfect dad with timeless advice for a child with a minor moral dilemma, like getting roped into taking two girls to the prom. Here we have a well meaning but often clueless dad. And his father-in law rather than settle down goes after a young hot woman for wife # 2. The show is fresh because, like in real life, there are plenty of guys going after younger women. And Jay gives us his funny old guy commentary about life with a sexy wife. The show was the first on network television to give us flawed but likable gay characters. When I say flawed I mean they are just as clueless as their heterosexual counterparts when it comes to being parents. To me, a parent of teenagers, it's funny because nobody on the show, like in real life, is perfect. Most family shows would have the teenager transition from H.S. to college with a few hiccups along the way, maybe some minor sibling difficulties but eventually, excelling, possibly getting into an elite school. (Think Micheal J. Fox's perfect Alex Keaton from Family Ties). Here we laugh and commiserate with Phil & Claire as they learn their daughter may not be ready for college after she's nabbed by the Campus Police, a real life bummer.",1410652800,2,1451,4.6061776061776065

Never disappoints, ,,, full of Laughs it is .pure comedy genius. Amazing cast &, writing!
Can't wait for season 6!",1410566400,,142,5.217391304347826
5798769,5,B00DHB3V14,There is a reason why this show wins so many awards.  It's the best.,1410307200,3,68,3.857142857142857
5798770,5,B00DHB3V14,"this show is still keeping me laughing and watching all episodes. mostly the whole cast will keep you entertained as will the writing. phil, Gloria, cam, Mitchell, jay are my favorites. their are some weaker points in the cast (Lilly) but thankfully the focus isn't truly on her. the highlight of this season has to be cam and Mitchell's wedding. the events leading to the wedding such as the proposal, and the wedding planning (where they end up playing match maker for their friend pepper. which wasn't too hard to do. chuckles) are worthy enough on their own to obtain this season.

yes, the kids may be getting older, but this show was never really about the kids. remember Everybody Loves Raymond was like that too. kids came in for some stories but it was really about the adult relationships, so too is modern family. its the adults we focus on, and the kids second. with that said some of the kids are starting to transition well into adulthood. Hayley looks to be headed towards a love with a man kind of like her father, which is a good contrast once she realizes that. chuckles. I can almost visualize the episode now with Claire having to talk her down and phil saying something completely off the wall unknowingly that helps her see its love is more important than falling in love with a dorky cute romantic loveable goofball. and if you know Hayley she was a complete prima donna, for her to love a sort of geeky guy and stick it out for good times and bad means something. alex is still on par with her old self, but I am thinking some sort of change up is coming her way. manny is growing into himself more and more and is still a delight. luke has made transition into teenager nicely as we see him coming of age liking girls and wanting to separate from his parents but yet needing them. all in all, even if its not really about the kids, its about the whole family with main focus on adults, the kids should and will transition into the fabric. after all that's modern family life.",1409616000,7,2000,4.449591280653951
5798771,1,B00DHB3V14,Another 1-star review because Fox is treating us like idiots by not releasing the series on Blu-ray. I am an international customer and we don't get this show on DVD/BD or TV. I purchased season 1-3 on BD this past month and they look spectacular so I wanted tohave every season in the best quality available. Now the only way for me to watch the show in HD is I download a rip from the net. Congratulations Fox!,1409529600,29,412,4.294871794871795
5798772,5,B00DHB3V14,"This show is brilliant. Every single episode has laugh-out-loud moments, and every single episode has very heartfelt moments. I tend to have ""favorite"" characters, but when I really look at it, each and every character is brilliant in their role. (I'm even talking Lilly...the kid is hilarious.) LOVE this show...glad I finally jumped on the bandwagon.",1407369600,2,352,5.303571428571429
5798773,1,B00DHB3V14,"The one star rating is NOT for the show itself......it's a GREAT SHOW.....loved Season 5......it deserves a five star rating. However, the one star rating if for the studio who releases the DVD/Blu-Ray of the show........20th Century Fox.  They released the first 4 Seasons on BOTH DVD and Blu-Ray.  But now, they have decided to only release the show on DVD only!!! Totally sucks, cause I have the series on Blu-Ray only!!!  I hope they decide to release Season 5 on Blu-Ray eventually......they usually announce both formats at the same time.....but not with Season 5.....it's DVD Only!!!  Very Disappointing!!!!",1406851200,46,614,5.171717171717172
5798774,1,B00DHB3V14,"I'm giving this a 1 because of how Fox is screwing over people who bought this show on Blu-ray by not continuing to release it on Blu-ray. It's like a big FU to fans IMO. I don't care about low sales, you don't release the first 4 seasons of a show on Blu-ray and then just stop. I haven't bought DVD versions of my favorite movies or TV shows since Blu-ray came out and I'm not going to start now.",1406592000,33,398,3.9875
5798775,5,B00DHB3V14,"Season 5 is definitely weaker than the first 4 seasons (Seasons 1 and 2 were the best), but the writing is certainly witty and the actors are great.  Definitely has my vote for a great show.",1403308800,2,190,4.277777777777778
5798776,5,B00DHB3V14,"I pre-ordered season 5 of Modern Family before it was even halfway over. While it had its share of stinkers, Season 5 was superbly bookended with the lovely season premiere (Mitch and Cam proposal) and the joyous season finale (The Wedding, Parts 1 and 2). I've enjoyed the extras, outtakes, and deleted scenes that accompanied seasons 1 through 4, and am very much looking forward to these extras in the season 5 set vis-a-vis the proposal and wedding episodes.",1401148800,5,462,4.860759493670886
