8489087,5,B005Y5NEOA,"Wonderful movie, but beware. The item sold from this listing, despite what it says is Region B, NOT region A. It will NOT work in an unaltered North American Bluray player. The seller or Amazon need to make adjustments before someone gets angry.",1418688000,2,245,4.72093023255814
8489088,4,B005Y5NEOA,"This DVD explores the cataclysmic event that ended the reign of the dinosaurs, a massive meteorite impact. It tells the story in a timeline fashion and with a fair bit of narrative - ie. they invent stories about what dinosaurs may have done or how some may have survived and shows them foraging for food, fighting over meat etc - but that adds a bit of humanity to the story (if you take my meaning).

Underlying all of this is the sciences as to what scale the impact was, how it would have sent tremors through the earth, created shockwaves and the way it would have affected different parts of the planet farther and farther out from ground zero. The numbers are hard to assimilate but it is totally absorbing.

The animation is not up to super awesome status but it gets the job done and has a charm of its own after a while.

As I say, fascinating.",1398556800,,854,4.3584905660377355
8489089,2,B005Y5NEOA,"Although the disk writeup specifically says Region 1 (North America) upon receipt the disk box says PAL version.  This will NOT play on any Blue-Ray player in North America.  1st disk received was cracked, 2nd disk received still doesn't play.

Once I get over these playing difficulties I'll write a review more about the film/movie.  If you can get a playing version: it's great -which is why I spent $40 to buy it.  However finding a playable version in the US is really hard.",1381622400,,479,4.654761904761905
