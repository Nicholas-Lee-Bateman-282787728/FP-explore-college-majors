8448227,5,B004YE4QMQ,"I have noticed that some travel shows when they go to Africa, Nigeria tends to be ignored and when I found out Globe trekker went to Nigeria I was pleased, especially as a Nigerian American who was born & raised in America but have parents who are Nigerian. I have travelled to Nigeria, and experienced Nigeria through my lenses from the beauty, positivity, negativity, and sometimes ugliness of Nigeria. I feel Globe trekker did their best to show Nigeria in all aspects, Nigeria is not a country you can sum up in a couple of minutes like the western Media tries to do cause of the many rich and diverse tribal cultures in different regions of the country, as a result I am glad Globe Trekker did that leap and did this series of Nigeria that sometimes other travel shows either ignore or refuse to even consider going to Nigeria. Besides Nollywood(Nigerian Film Industry), Nigerians posting images or videos of Nigeria on youtube and etc to show the Nigeria the media ignores to showcase, I feel Adela Ucar did a good job to me in showing a side of Nigeria that will help people that may just rely on the media have a better understanding of Nigeria. I loved her vibe, hopefully Globe Trekker will do a part 2 cause I will definitely watch & Buy it.",1481414400,,1252,4.5198237885462555
