6496506,4,B00LOCLB1K,"Whether you love or loathe John Cena, he has always had memorable rivalries. However, this set, to me anyway, does not include enough of Edge, JBL, and Randy Orton. In fact, this set should only include those three because over the dozen or so years he has been in WWE, those are the main three which come to mind.

Orton, who has always been the achilles heel of John Cena. Even if they go a couple of years without wrestling one another, they can always loop back to their rivalry which has continuously progressed through both go their careers. Edge, who, in 2006, had Cena's best feud, matches, and segments by far. JBL, who, in essence, pretty much progressively passed the torch to Cena in 2005.

WWE loves to make Cena movies because they know it lines their pockets; however, if they want another twenty from my wallet, feature an entire blu-ray with these three.",1417996800,,871,4.612903225806452

6496511,4,B00LOCLB1K,"John Cena is one of those names in sports entertainment that I don't need to give an introduction to because regardless of how you feel about him, everyone knows who he is & what's he's done in this business. The title of this DVD set alone describes what this set is about in that Cena discusses his greatest feuds in his career speaking on various subjects such as how Eddie Guerrero wanted to teach, why it was important him & Batista were seperated for so long, how wrestling Shawn Michaels was a ""night off"", what Orton has that he doesn't that gives him a next generation comparison to a legend, what major sports icons he compared J.B.L. & Chris Jericho with, why he called Edge ""old shoe"", how Triple H is the measuring stick, what famous movie series he viewed his matches against The Rock to, and additional comments on C.M. Punk on the Blu-Ray.  Along with his comments are two matches showcasing each rival with one being an early encounter while the other was a more recent encounter (except for The Rock's case which is one match & the Legends Panel segment) while they went with a DVD menu being a unique throwback to the old Street Fighter video game.

Now normally I give my summary at the end of my review but John Cena causes so much uproar & differences of opinion in regards to anything with his name associated with it that I'll just give it now.  Positives for this release is that I really liked the format they used of having a match from their earliest encounters followed by a more recent match as it's something I would like to see more with other superstar sets in the future while the match selection included more of the rarer television encounters instead of a ""best of PPV matches"" selection when those are available on their network.  I can't disagree with a majority of the names selected except for one in that I don't agree with J.B.L. being selected on here as I understand that he was Cena's first main event feud & first WWE Championship win (the biggest disappointing World Title switch in WrestleMania history) but I just never thought they had a good singles match against each other unless it was held under a no-rules type stipulation (""I Quit"" or ""NYC Parking Lot Brawl"") yet none of those matches were selected and it would have been better to have someone else selected for that spot (I personally would have chosen Kurt Angle or Brock Lesnar).  We all know that odds are the ""Lets Go Cena"" fans will get this while the ""Cena Sucks"" critics who have strong feelings against him will crap all over it & probably click NO on any review on here that isn't a burial but for this is overall a nice collection with some matches that are definitely worth a replay value for neutral fans (with the only downfall being most of those matches are available on other sets for heavy DVD collectors).

Matches Include:
vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was the first round of the tournament to determine who would face WWE Champion Brock Lesnar at Backlash as Cena attacked Eddie coming into the ring working a ground & pound mixed with power offense while Eddie used his high flying along with technical ability he's known for in what was a very short match but competitive for what it was.
""SmackDown"" Apr. 03

Parking Lot Brawl vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was previously known as an ""Iron Circle Match"" where wrestlers had their cars parked in a circle in a parking garage for the competitors to fight in as this match started off as the brawl expected in this environment with both men using the cars as weapons to bounce each other's heads off & throwing their bodies into while also taking various weapons from inside the cars to use on each other from a shovel to even a lawn mower as the fight got more aggressive with various car parts continued to be used as a weapons to the windows being busted apart including some comedic situations of Eddie just being himself in what resulted in a very aggressive physical brawl.
""SmackDown"" Sept. 03
[Viva La Raza: The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero]

Prototype (Cena) vs. OVW Champion Leviathan (Batista) - Leviathan showcased his superior power early easily showing Cena down & kept taking him down with offense like strong clotheslines to the point where Cena had to pull a desperate tactic to gain control heavily focusing on the lower back with repeated whips into the corner & various suplexes as they fought in the ring while their allies at ringside had their own action on the outside of the ring in what was a good showcase of their early days in developmental.
""Ohio Valley Wrestling"" Feb. 02

WWE Championship/Last Man Standing Match vs. Batista - Before I get started, if your not a fan of Matt Striker's heelish commentary or his interactions with Jerry Lawler & Michael Cole when I suggest you watch this on mute as things once again started to get heated between both men to the point where Cole had to yell at him to just shut up & call the match. Now both men tried to pick up the win early on after planting the other guy with each move before Batista gained the advantage working on Cena's knees with a chair & the figure four. Cena was able to recover & took advantage of the ""Extreme Rules"" with executing an Attitude Adjustment on the chair in the ring along with the announce table. There were times where both men brought weapons into the match that ended up backfiring on them such as Batista with a chair & Cena bringing in a table only to be crashed through it. After seeing how the power moves wouldn't keep Batista down, he went back to what he knew worked for him at WrestleMania with the STF and used another object to put Batista in a ""sticky"" situation causing Cena to embarrass Batista.
Extreme Rules 10

vs. Shawn Michaels - This was a non-title rematch from WrestleMania 23 as both men had the same game plan in the early moments feeling each other out & going for a single body part while also having counters to each other's offense & utilizing the same moves such as a headlock takeover before Cena heavily focused on the neck area while Shawn took advantage of an opening allowing himself to target the arm also using the ringside environment to heavily work it over to the point where Cena was showing the effects such as only able to execute a bodyslam with one hand as both men traded momentum with leading to some impactful action both in & outside of the ring along with sequences resulting in a match that went close to an hour that has been regarded in not just one of the best matches in both men's careers but also the history of RAW.
""RAW"" Apr. 07
[Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story]

vs. Shawn Michaels - Both men started off going back & forth early with both men playing to their strengths such as Cena's power or HBK's speed with them exchanging submission attempts early along with various strikes before Shawn was able to use Cena's momentum against him heavily working over the knee to the point where Cena was showing effects but still able to use some of his strength as they traded momentum throughout the rest of the match with counters & reversals against each other.
""RAW"" Mar. 08

WWE Championship Match vs. Randy Orton - Randy Orton was clearly the crowd favorite coming into this match as both men were pretty even starting out using the same offense moves against each other before Orton was able to take control with heavily focusing on Cena's head with big strikes & wrenching headlocks while staying one step ahead being able to immediately have a comeback for any offense Cena attempted to do including using his own momentum against him & taking the action to the outside on more than one occasion while Cena was able to make some impact with whatever he was able to hit along with taking advantage of any open Orton gave him but this was overall the ""stereotypical"" Cena match as he was on defense for a high majority of the match.
SummerSlam 07
[John Cena Experience]

vs. Randy Orton - This was the third match in Orton's gauntlet to face each of his Elimination Chamber opponents leading up to the PPV as both men had the same idea early on using the same moves while Cena kept going for quick pins causing Orton to keep retreating to the outside resulting in the action eventually making it way outside of the ring with the ringside environment coming into play allowing Orton to take advantage slowing the pace down while staying a step ahead countering Cena's signature offense & keep stopping him when he attempted to gain momentum only for Cena to ""never give up"" despite whatever Orton threw at him with Orton returning the favor when Cena was able to execute some of his impactful moves as well.
""RAW"" Feb. 14

vs. WWE Champion J.B.L. - J.B.L. had a great entrance with the Presidential limo & police escort into the arena but it goes downhill from there as it was basically J.B.L. beating down Cena throughout the whole match only for Cena hits three strong moves, the F.U., and wins the match. This was definitely one of the worst WWE Championship matches & title changes in history plus a horrible way (even foreshadowing on some people's opinions) to begin the first of many title reigns of John Cena & his beginning of being the top guy in the company.
WrestleMania 21
[Greatest Superstars Of WrestleMania]

vs. J.B.L. - Triple H was on commentary for this match as Cena was set to face him at the Night Of Champions PPV which caused a distraction early allowing J.B.L. to attack from behind & dominate Cena in & outside of the ring with various big blows focusing on the head & neck area with Cena attempting to get some offense in only for J.B.L. to keep staying one step ahead with counters & escapes while also resorting to desperate tactics whenever he seemed to be losing control.  This was pretty much a repeat of their WrestleMania match years earlier as this was a dominate showcase of J.B.L. causing Cena to perform the ""stereotypical"" performance he's been known for.
""RAW"" June 08

WWE Championship/""Your Fired"" Match vs. Chris Jericho - This was the rematch from SummerSlam the previous night with the special condition that whoever lost the match would be fired from WWE with Eric Bischoff at ringside in favor of Jericho & kept getting involved throughout the match as Jericho was completely dominate here with Cena only able to brief momentum with clotheslines, punches & shoulderblocks while Jericho used dirty tactics along with whatever he could get his hands on working over Cena's back throughout the match including the Walls Of Jericho to the point where you saw this effect him when trying to deliver the FU.  This was the performance from Cena that he gets heavily criticized for while Jericho was able to adjust to Cena's style of the time to make the match work.
""RAW"" Aug 05
[Breaking The Code: Behind The Walls Of Chris Jericho]

vs. World Champion Chris Jericho - This was Cena's first match back from his neck injury months earlier in his hometown of Boston as Jericho immediately targeted Cena's neck heavily working it over before Cena came at Jericho more aggressively than seen before as he hit some big trademark finishing moves & impactful strikes in the early moments of the match but also showing that he's more cautious of what he's doing such as second guessing taking some high risk as they traded momentum with sequences of countering each other's signature moves with one of their own with Jericho catching Cena & continuing to punish his neck with repeated kicks & strikes & high impact submission offense directly to his head & neck area along with having no problems stretching the rules in his favor along with Cena continuing to use his superior strength to his advantage as well.
Survivor Series 08
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]

WWE Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. Edge - Cena came into this match with an injured arm & Edge heavily focused on that arm with kicks, using the ropes to stretch it out, and various armbars. Cena's arm was hurt to the point where it hurt to do his own offense such as his ""throwback."" At one point Cena tried to escape the cage only using his good arm before Edge yanked him down via his bad arm & applied a variation of the crossface. Cena kept fighting back with one arm delivering a bulldog off the top rope & his belly to belly suplex but Edge kept going after Cena's arm & even threw him into the cage arm first. A chair got involved with a chairshot being delivered that sounded like a shotgun going off before outside interference played an important factor here. With Cena having a reputation of playing ""superman"" & no-selling, that wasn't the case here as they told a great story revolving around the injured arm.
""RAW"" Oct. '06
[Greatest Steel Cage Matches; Top 25 Rivalries]

World Championship/Last Man Standing Match vs. Edge - Anyone who's seen their previous encounters knows that Edge is the one guy who can bring out the best in Cena while Cena gives his best performances in matches where there are ""no rules brawls"" & this match proved my point. They've fought countless times over the years but yet was able to still pull out a match that was different than their previous matches they told a great story about how they just beat each other into exhaustion & knew each other so well that they were able to counter their signature moves right from the start, built up the pace over time, came up with some new creative spots throughout the match (boy, the front row got their money's worth didn't they?), used weapons, went all over the place, and had an ending that was quite the visual when it happened. This was their best match outside of their T.L.C. match, no questions asked.
Backlash 09
[Best Of PPV Matches 2009-2010]

WWE Championship Match vs. Triple H - his match was similar to how the Hogan/Rock match at WrestleMania X8 was in that WWE had this match setup for one guy to be the babyface & the other the heel but the fans decided otherwise. It was during this period that John Cena was receiving a heavy amount of backlash by the fans as WWE Champion despite how much WWE was trying to force the audience to cheer for him (his previous Kurt Angle feud is a perfect example of that) which resulted in Triple H (who's no stranger to the audience disliking him for being shoved down their throats) being the lesser of two evils to the audience & came into this match as the fan favorite. As eluded to in the weeks building up to this event, Triple H took Cena very lightly & kept showing him up throughout the match...which would eventually come back to bite him as not only did the match end with the result that some people didn't expect but how it ended was in a way that even more people didn't expect. As a side note, pay attention to the ring entrances during this match as both of them came off as ""did they really think that would get over"" moments while if you pay close attention during Cena's entrance...you'll see a ""Straight Edge"" Chicago mobster.
WrestleMania 22
[True Story Of WrestleMania]

vs. Triple H - This was right before the Bragging Rights PPV and this was hyped as Cena's possible last appearance on RAW because if he lost, he was going to leave RAW for good. Both men started out slow & built up over time as both men throughout the match attempted their various signature moves & submissions which were countered & kicked out of various times along with Triple H focusing on Cena's back & eventually applied the sharpshooter at one point. This was a good competitive match that went around the 20 minute mark.
""RAW"" Oct. 09
[Best Of RAW 2009]

vs. WWE Champion The Rock - Both men started off with various stalemates early as each man was able to take the other man down before Cena whipped Rock hard into the corner where you saw it take an effect allowing Cena to ground Rock & keep him down with suplexes & slams. Momentum started to trade as both men knew each other so well from their previous match that they had a counter for each other's offense from the spinebuster to five knuckle shuffle to even submissions like the STF & sharpshooter as they continued to try to one up each other eventually hitting their moves after multiple attempts along with the strong finishers like the Rock Bottom & Attitude Adjustment before going back to trading fist & even stealing the other guys signature moves to the point where you saw a moment of ""deva vu."" I have to give credit & respect to both men as they've only had one other match against each other in their careers which was a year ago yet was able to come out & deliver a completely different match against each other that also played off the effects of the match a year earlier plus as we would later find out that The Rock got seriously injured early in the match to the point where he needed surgery yet still went so knowing that now, I'll give it more credit.
WrestleMania XXIX
[Best PPV Matches Of 2013]

(Blu-Ray) vs. C.M. Punk - This was the first ever meeting between both men that saw Punk work over Cena's neck while also witnessing a couple of unique reversals & counters like how Punk was able to keep escaping the Attitude Adjustment or how Cena was able to counter the GTS into a STF with Cena having to deliver an impactful Attitude Adjustment from a different position than usual resulting in a good match for their first time together.
""RAW"" Nov. 09
[Best Of RAW 2009]

(Blu-Ray) vs. C.M. Punk - The winner of this match would go on to to face The Rock for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIX as both men started off exchanging exchanges & didn't stop from there as this was a match that had both men going back & forth with momentum non-stop in regards to either grounded offense such as the front facelock & side headlock to submissions like the Anaconda Vice & STF to impactful moves such as the suicide dive & piledriver to their signature moves of the Attitude Adjustment & Go To Sleep as Cena was trying to work a faster pace pulling out moves that we rarely or haven't seen from him before while Punk was more slow & methodical targeting Cena's neck including one move that is so dangerous that it's shortened & ended careers in the past. Punk & Cena just have this natural chemistry with each other bringing out some of their best performances in their WWE careers with this being no exception.
