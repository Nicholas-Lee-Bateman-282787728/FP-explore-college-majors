4118840,4,B003FSTN8E,"For some reason I remembered season 10 being a big step down. I didn't expect to enjoy this set nearly as much I have.
  While the presence of certain characters is missed, the new characters introduced in previous seasons were actually built
  up well enough to fit in right along 90210 originals Steve, Kelly, Donna, David and Dylan. The only down part of the season is
  watching Noah spin out of control again ala David in earlier seasons and Gina leaving a ways before the end never to return. Beyond that it was still very enjoyable and for show's 10th and ending season to be only a notch below what it was at it's peak says a lot. Some classic stuff (Dylan finding his father is alive), and surprises (I forgot a grown up Josie Davis was on several episodes). Definitely worth getting.",1294099200,,793,4.510489510489511

4118843,5,B003FSTN8E,"""90210"" is one of the best television shows to ever air. I grew up on this show, as a child, teen-ager, and young adult, it taught me quite a few life lessons.

4118885,4,B003FSTN8E,"Been a huge fan of the show since it originally aired, love it. Took off a star though because a lot of the soundtrack has been changed since these aired on TV. Guess there are licensing issues? But it really puts a damper on going back to enjoy this nineties classic...without the 90's tunes!!!! Same deal when you try to watch this on Hulu except even worse because some episodes are just completely missing!

4118891,5,B003FSTN8E,"(This review is for the content of the series not the quality of the dvd and/or set.) POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT. Despite what many fans seem to say, that  this is when the show went down hill, I really like the last couple of seasons. I didn't start watching this show at all until 2008 (and I was born in 1990) so I was starting college and watched the reruns on soap-net from season 1 episode 1, never missing a single one. I naturally gravitated more towards the college years anyway. In mid-season 9 after my favorite characters Brandon and Valerie left, I thought the rest of the show would be horrible but the new characters grew on me and the story lines were pretty interesting. The worst episode in my opinion was ""Doc Martin"" because they treated Gina horribly and I was sad to see her go, but overall it was a great season. Not the best but definitely not the worst.",1450483200,,875,4.401234567901234

4118958,5,B003FSTN8E,"Hello,

This TV series is one my favorites, I've seen the entire series a few thousand times and love it every time. My cable company quit carrying SoapNet who re-runs the show and I had decided to continue the rest of the DVDs with of course the final season. I love how the writers ended the series with David & Donna getting married. Us fans knew they were meant to be since the beginning of the series.

If you're collecting the series, you must own the final season to see how the series closes out.

I highly recommend.
Thanks.",1357948800,5,533,4.363636363636363

4118966,2,B003FSTN8E,"Beverly Hills 90210: Season 10 is the ultimate clique season. I've never quite seen anything like it. Nearly every episode, at least one member of the gang kept stressing the need to stay in Beverly Hills to be with her/his friends, refusing to move out and relocate to somewhere, denying romantic relationships because s/he did not want to sacrifice her/his friends for it, and willing to put friends ahead of anything. That was nauseous for me to watch. Every time a boyfriend/girlfriend was sacrificed for this, they should be quite lucky not to deal with it anymore and just move on. They are way better off this way because once they are friends with one of the gang, they are forced to accept the gang no matter what. What a terrible thought...I must say. As for the rest of the season, I can honestly say that there is absolutely nothing new going on: just the same repeated issues, recycled junk, prolonged maintenance, and useless storylines that were never completely resolved in the end. For example, Dylan's father (I am pretty sure that car bomb killed him) shows up in Dylan's life and yet after a couple of episodes, the whole subplot got dropped without further ado. Similarly, Gina Kincaid...after watching a couple of episodes, I just realized that I've not seen her anymore (she wasn't a memorable character to begin with). Then, all of a sudden, Steve's brother just shows up; that is a while, and this time, I don't even see the other brother. Camille, who was dating David for some episodes, was all heartbroken when David dumped her. I am like, ""Really? You want that loser?"" If there was a contest for the worst finale of all time, Beverly Hills 90210 wins it hands down. I mean, when the series started and for few years, Donna and David were never the primary characters yet in the end, they get the most attention? Who cares if they got married? I predict divorce for the two because David was a loser in high school, was a loser in college, and is a loser post college. Plus, he controls people. If he can't control people, then he can't win. He married Donna because he was capable of controlling her. Dylan and Kelly...my goodness...who really cares? They have absolutely no chemistry, and it's impossible to see them together. It's just the same story over and over. Quite frankly, all of the characters need to get out of 90210 and really explore the world and at least meet some real people. Steve and Janet, I love that wedding because who showed up for it? That's right: only the members of the 90210 gang minus Brandon (I am surprised about that one, considering that Steve considers him as his best friend. Ditto for the godfather part too.). So...does Janet have friends...? Relatives...? Or anybody else...? Steve...frat friends...? Relatives...? Or anyone at all...? Meanwhile, it is simply difficult or impossible for me to believe that every character is capable of running a business, being a lawyer, or whatever it is that they do because all of the characters have way too much free time on their hands. And then listening to them to have dialogues, they don't even fit the role. The more Donna appears in the episodes, the more I hate the sight of her. I can't believe how much screen time she was getting. Then, there was a trainload of impossibly good looking men that she got the chance to kiss them. Notice in the opening credits. Some episodes will include Joe E. Tata in there, and some omit his name. I never seen anything like it. Back to Dylan, at the rate that he is spending his money, he is heading for bankruptcy. Dylan's method for any problem is his wallet. Brilliant, Dylan. Meanwhile, notice that Dylan received his degree from CU. Hmmm...I don't think he had classes in some seasons ago, so...to get it, he took maybe 6 to 7 classes per semester including the summer for 2 years? I never saw him with books in many episodes. Or he paid for it? Finally, I can't believe it is all over. I've seen every single episode of Beverly Hills 90210 (296 episodes in all), and I nominate it as one of the worst popular shows ever made. It lasted far too long, had gotten way too soap operatic, and was running on fumes for most of the last three seasons (it had become way too Donna-centric). As for the rest of my life, I will never watch a single episode of the show again. In the end, there is a special feature about Goodbyes, and I saw Brenda's face was concealed by a blurry image even though her body is shown. Wow, never seen anything like it either. Many of the long time characters were also omitted in it as well.

Here is a list of top 16 worst characters (1 being the worst of the worst):
1. Felice Martin *gag*
2. Brenda Walsh *double gag*
3. Clare Arnold *triple gag*
4. Valerie Malone *quadruple gag*
5. Gina Kincaid *quintuple gag*
6. David Silver (the biggest loser of the show)
7. Brandon Walsh (the biggest hypocrite of all time)
8. Susan Keats *ugghhh*
9. Andrea Zuckerman *double ugghhh*
10. Colin Robbins (how is prison treating ya?)
11. Ginger LaMonica *blah*
12. Janet Sosna (too snotty)
13. Donna Martin (AWFUL HAIR)
14. Steve Sanders (he has completely turned a boneheaded moron in the last 4 seasons)
15. Noah Hunter (pathetic when drunk)
16. Matt Durning (should have been disbarred a long ago)",1325894400,2,5276,4.6127659574468085
