8328424,5,B001NZ020Y,I loved it!  I never thought wrapping could be so fun.  I love the luggage wrap with the teddy bear and anything that lights up is always cool. I wish she had a Christmas DVD. No more gift bags for me!,1283817600,,201,3.8780487804878048
8328425,2,B001NZ020Y,"First of all, it is very difficult to find instructional DVDs on the subjects of gift wrapping and gift baskets.  I was excited when I first found this because I thought it would provide inspiration and some additional instruction.  Unfortunately, it only gave me limited inspiration.  I thought that it might give me some more how-to instruction but was seriously disappointed that it only taught me how to measure a box to wrap a gift and nothing more.  If that wasn't bad enough the bad jokes, crass wisecracks and just unnecessary humor was extremely distracting to the purpose of the DVD (I don't even think she smiled during the whole DVD).  If the ""host"" spent more time on the instructional and left out her horrible wisecracks this might have actually been a decent instructional video.  I believe the author has good information to share but it seems that I need to buy the book in order to get it.  Disappointing to say the least!",1267833600,,941,4.701219512195122
