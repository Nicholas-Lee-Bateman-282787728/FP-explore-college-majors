6463967,5,B00L37J2FS,"I did not know who Mengele was. However the title of the film and the period setting give you a pretty good idea after a while that the German Doctor is a Nazi on the run. Moreover someone keeps sending him large amounts of cash - Nazi sympathizers. But the doctor has a calm and kindly manner and people trust him more than they know they should.  The doctor treats a young girl successfully - as it turns out - more her good luck than anything else. However a woman outs him at a party and the Doctor flees before he can be caught. An intriguing film with all the play between surface and substance. Throughout most of the film, the gorgeous Patagonia setting seems to supersede the evil truth.",1414454400,,696,4.3538461538461535
6463968,4,B00L37J2FS,"In the late 1950s, a Patagonian family who have recently renovated a seaside hotel become acquainted with a friendly, if slightly distant German doctor, and he becomes their first paying guest.  The foreign doctor slowly inserts himself into their lives and wins their confidence, showing a particular interest in the mother's pregnancy and the pint-sized 12-year-old daughter's slower-than-usual growth.  The audience knows what the family does not:  he is beastly Auschwitz physician Josef Mengele, a Nazi war criminal who evaded capture in South America until his death by drowning in 1979.  Beneath its deliberate pace and picturesque photography, The German Doctor borders on playing as a horror film, drawing enormous and at times nauseating suspense from the idea of regular and sympathetic people having such evil in their midst without realizing it.  There are echoes of such films as The Spirit of the Beehive and Pan's Labyrinth in the way the adult drama is seen through the 12-year-old's dreamily impressionable eyes.  It is also an interesting portrait of postwar Argentina and the culture which made it such a desirable place for wealthy Nazis on the run, including a substantial German community and an Axis-friendly leader in Juan Per&oacute;n.",1413676800,6,1261,5.343434343434343

6463975,4,B00L37J2FS,"I found this film on Dr. Mengel fascinating and probably represents his personality. He did experiment on man twins and did gruesome experiments on people of all ages. I feel sorry for the Sematic people of Jewish faith. They seem to have been the mosy brutalized of all the people tortured and killed by the Nazi government. I still can not understand how a Great Nation and Superb people could do these evil acts. I have read a great book by an Ace Luftwaffe pilot that says it best. The people were embarassed and ashamed of the loss they had sustained and the very harsh punishment doled out by the victorious allies. There was chaos and calamity everywhere in Germnay. The people needed someone to restore the nation's honor and pride. National Socialism and Adolph Hitler brought that new hope. Unfortunately, the madman that was in charge of National Socialism encouraged members of the SS and other groups to committ heinous crimes with the understanding that they would not be charged as criminals. That position lead to the rise of many men like Mengle. He did not live to see the gallows but died an accidental death. Now he has to face eternity with the voices of the millions he and others destroyed constantly screaming in his ears the words Murderer!!!",1410998400,3,1267,4.737556561085973
6463976,4,B00L37J2FS,"""The German Doctor"" (2013 release from Argentina; original title ""Wakolda""; 94 min.) brings the story of how one family in Argentina gets acquainted with a doctor from Germany with a suspicious past. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is ""Patagonia, 1960"". The doctor seems lost and asks the family if he can follow their car to get back on track. Among the family is Lilith, a 12 year old girl ""but you look only 10"", comments the doctor. Due to various early childhood illnesses, Lilith is not growing as it should, much to her (and her mom's dismay). Meanwhile, we get to see more about the German community in Argentina, having fled Europe when the Nazi regime collapsed. It becomes clear who the German doctor really is. Then Lilith's mom agrees to have him treat Lilith with growth hormones originally tested on animals. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the debut feature length from writer-director Luca Puenzo, based on her own book ""Wakolda"". What a masterful job she has done with this movie! Second, it's not clear to me to what extent the movie is based on true events. Of course we do know about the many Nazi-Germans who fled to South America, But did ""the angel of death"" really meet this particular family? Third, when you see the portrayal of the German community in Argentina, it just sickens you to think that many South American countries (not just Argentina, but also Paraguay, Brazil, etc.) allowed these war criminals to live carefree lives, in the open, within their borders, for decades after WWII. Fourth, there are some outstanding performances, none more so than lex Brendemhl in the title role, who at times seems sympathetic yet always elusive. This movie was Argentina's submission for this year's Oscar for Best Foreign Language movie (it didn't get nominated). Bottom line: this is a spellbinding thriller and psychological drama.

""The German Doctor"" opened with little or no pre-release fanfare of buzz at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati this weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at yesterday was reasonably well attended, I'm happy to say. If you are in the mood for a top notch quality foreign movie that is miles aware for your standard Hollywood fare of action super-heroes and the like, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The German Doctor"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1405728000,67,2449,4.856459330143541
6463977,1,B00L37J2FS,"So, I'd been wanting to watch the movie because I believe it's important to study history that should not be repeated. It is a fictional account of a real life war criminal, but it gives some insight into the era. I can only say that if you already have a fear of dolls, this is not the film for you, as they seem to be used metaphorical to represent the perversion of man's innocence and dignity by Mengele. May God have mercy on all of the soul's that perished during this tragic time.",1499472000,2,487,4.247311827956989

6463990,5,B00L37J2FS,"""The German Doctor"" is outstanding, deftly blending documented facts into a fictional relationship with a  loving, happy family ... who are completely unaware that they have befriended a Nazi who fled trial and a certain death sentence at Nuremberg in 1949 by escaping to Argentina. His interactions with them gradually reveal the vicious duality of his nature, hidden behind a friendly demeanor and a handsome face. With an excellent script and top-notch actors, this makes for very good cinematic storytelling.

Mengele, the ""Angel of Death"" at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps during WWII, had personally ordered the killing of many thousands, and experimented on victims who were of genetic or physical interest to him (especially twins) without mercy or conscience before finally killing them.

He moved frequently around Europe and between South American countries, aided by a network of former SS members The relentless Nazi  hunter Simon Wiesenthal pressured West German authorities into drawing up an arrest warrant in June 1959. This started extradition proceedings.but Argentina delayed approval until June 1960, by which time Mengele had already fled to Paraguay, where he was living on a farm near the Argentine border. Mengele's stay in Paraguay was used as the basis for this fictional Argentinian film.

Some reviewers have mentioned how kind he was to the young girl and that this is,perhaps,a redeeming quality. A former Auschwitz prisoner doctor observed:

""He was capable of being so kind to the children, to have them become fond of him, to bring them sugar, to think of small details in their daily lives, and to do things we would genuinely admire ... And then, next to that, ... the crematoria smoke, and these children, tomorrow or in a half-hour, he is going to send them there. Well, that is where the anomaly lay.""",1489449600,11,1852,5.197986577181208

You knew there was something odd about the doctor, as the father of the young girl sensed all along.  He was a nice looking man, which Mengele was I think, and appeared somewhat kind as he related to the young girl.  I wondered if he actually was helping them out of a generosity of spirit that the doctor had in addition to his evil side.  Perhaps he was different after the war?  It was interesting at the end when he said goodbye to the young girl to see his true personality come through.  A disturbing film, but if you are interested in the villains of WWII you might find it interesting, as I did.

6464046,4,B00L37J2FS,"Filmed in the rolling landscapes of Patagonia, Argentina, WAKOLDA is a truly harrowing story of the Nazi doctor who continued to practice his experiments well after the Second World War had ended.

In exile and among a group of Nazi sympathizers, Josef Mengele (lex Brendemhl) lives under an assumed name, and ingratiates himself with a family running a hotel. Befriending the young daughter Lilith (Florencia Bado) he claims to be able to increase her growth and thereby prevent her from being teased at school for being the smallest in the class. She readily agrees; as do her parents. This provides the pretext for Mengele to continue his macabre researches that actually do more harm than good.

Luca Puenzo's film contrasts the domestic world of Lilith with the world of the Nazi sympathizers congregating in a local German school. They still practice the salute, and forge a regimented atmosphere guaranteed to impose order on the unwilling learners. Lilith is sent to the school, in the hope of receiving a good education - although remaining largely unaffected by Nazi ideology, she is made painfully aware of her lack of height, which only encourages her to seek Mengele's help even more.

Set in 1960, WAKOLDA draws a direct parallel between Mengele's work and the doll-manufacturing practiced by Lilith's father Enzo (Diego Peretti). At first Enzo makes all the toys himself; but with Mengele's investment the venture is transformed into a small cottage industry, where all the dolls' faces are identical and they are given tiny mechanized beating hearts. We are made painfully aware that Mengele treats humanity with just the same indifference as the factory workers treat their dolls - as material for experimentation rather than living breathing personae.

The film maintains a cool, detached tone throughout; although Israeli agents pursue Mengele with the same enthusiasm as with other ex- Nazis (notably Adolf Eichmann), they fail to capture him. But this is not really the film's concern: director Puenzo is far more concerned with Mengele's terrible plausibility as a practicing doctor taking unwitting victims into his confidence and subsequently abusing them.",1457395200,,2180,5.255747126436781

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

""The German Doctor"" is Luca Puenzo's take on what Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele (aka ""The Angel of Death"") might have been doing while he was on the run in Argentina in the early 60s. Puenzo has fashioned her story based on her own 2011 novel, ""Wakolda."" Since Mengele is revealed to be Puenzo's protagonist from the get go, the film offers little in terms of suspense. Nonetheless, ""The German Doctor"" is worthwhile in other respects and Puenzo manages to convey a believable tale despite its fictional underpinnings.

Puenzo's framing device is a coming of age story focusing on 12 year old Lillith, who has arrived in 1960 with her Argentinian father, Enzo, German-speaking mother, Eva (descended from German immigrants who came to Argentina years before), and brothers Tomas and Polo, to the town of Bariloche, a German enclave in the Patagonian region of Argentina. Enzo and Eva are re-opening a family held inn and their first paying guest is Helmut Gregor, a creepy doctor who actually is Josef Mengele, responsible for ghastly crimes against humanity while he was head doctor at Auschwitz during World War II.

Lillith, a victim of stunted physical development, is unmercifully mocked by fellow students at the German speaking school she attends. In steps Gregor who offers Eva assistance in helping to advance Lillith's maturation by administering growth hormone injections.

As a descendant of ethnic Germans, Eva trusts Gregor instinctively and perhaps is symbolic of the Nazi sympathizers during the Third Reich, whom were seduced by promises of national victory via theories of racial superiority. In order to help her daughter, Eva is willing to betray her husband, who is dead set against the idea of hormone injections that, in his opinion, are against nature.

Not only is Eva seduced, but later Gregor seduces Enzo, by offering to mass produce his special children's porcelain doll design. Enzo perhaps represents the ""Good Germans"" who were opposed to Nazi theories of racial superiority but were taken in by the quest for material advancement.

Puenzo also does well in reminding us that individuals such as Mengele could not have thrived without the support of the community who gave comfort to him. Gregor aka Mengele received money from ex-Nazis and Nazi sympathizers which was passed on to him by members of the ethnic German community in Argentina. The violence underneath the surface is perhaps best illustrated by the brutal beating of one of the children at the German speaking school by a coterie of latter day descendants of the Hitler Youth.

When Mengele was at Auschwitz, his obsession with twins, would often lead him to conduct barbaric experiments (such as surgically attaching twins together to observe their behavior). Here too he appears to be taking an unhealthy interest in Eva, who is now about to give birth to a set of twins herself. But when Enzo learns of Gregor's administration of hormone treatments on Lillith, he orders the bad doctor off the premises immediately.

In a twist, Eva gives birth to twins who are premature and Enzo has no choice to allow Gregor to assist in helping the twins hours after their birth. Puenzo makes things uncomfortable for everyone by suggesting that evil (in the shape of monster Mengele) has a human face (Gregor), who can harbor ordinary benevolent feelings alongside the monstrous (Gregor's treatment involves prescribing different doses of milk for each infant).

In the end, it hardly matters whether this Mengele is real or a fake. Puenzo's makes the good point that seemingly normal people, irrespective of a past positive ethical history, can be easily seduced by evil, when it suits their interests.",1427587200,4,3758,5.066343042071197

6464076,4,B00L37J2FS,"The story follows Josef Mengele, the German SS officer and a physician that conducted the horrific experiments that the Auschwitz concentration camp is infamous for.  Much of the experimentation that Auschwitz is infamous for was conducted for the war effort, namely the cold water experiments intended to advance survival techniques for pilots downed in cold waters.  These military experiments were mostly conducted on adults.

However, many of the other experiments were intended towards the advancement of eugenic goals and were of no military value whatsoever.  They were intended to advance the breeding of the ""master race."" Eugenics was the science of breeding better humans using the same measures a farmer would use on livestock. This is where twins, especially at childhood age, became useful to the eugenicists like Mengele. This is why Mengele is also known for his ghastly experimentation on twins to advance National Socialist eugenic policy.

 ""The German Doctor"" extrapolates a likely scenario of Mengele continuing this work with the children of South America.  It depicts Mengele preying on the trust of the family that has allowed them to stay with him.  Mengele experiments on one of the daughters with growth hormones.  The mother allows it as the daughter was smaller than normal for her age. The mother also allows Mengele to conduct his questionable medicine with the twin babies she is expecting.  The horrid revelation becomes clear to the mother when she learns that Mengele was sacrificing one of the twins as a ""control"" subject, just as he had done with many twins in Auschwitz.

The subtitled movie is very well crafted and would likely satisfy the tastes of foreign film fans. As a historian of the eugenics movement, this author would have like to have seen more backstory in order to give the viewer perspective as to exactly what Mengele was up to.  The backstory is otherwise used to depict the remorse over the latitude allowed by the mother.  The film does show many tight shots of what is supposed to be Mengele's journal and somewhat vague explanations for his actions.  However, these are only tied back to what transpired in Auschwitz by allusion and inference.

Eugenics is still poorly understood by the general public, so it is unclear how much a typical viewer will truly understand beyond the uncomfortable and obvious ethical violations.  Many of the reasons as to why eugenics has been largely swept under the rug by historians are explored in my first book, ""From a `Race of Masters' to a `Master Race': 1948 to 1848."" Eugenics and ""scientific racism"" did have a logic, ghastly and inhumane as it may have been.  These ethical questions and dilemmas are still relevant today, so an explanation as to why Mengele thought his actions justified would have added a level of intellectual sophistication and complexity to the film.  The film may have otherwise served as an artful replay of the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial. These post-war trials contended with the captured German doctors. Many of these captured Nazis defended themselves by presenting the medical journals of Americans and British doctors that were overtly supportive of their eugenics; an uncomfortable fact that needs to be explored by dramatists like Puenzo.",1424044800,3,3271,5.116541353383458

6464082,4,B00L37J2FS,"Set in 1960 we are introduced to a German doctor in Patagonia - Argentina. He is on his way to Bariloche and travels with a family he has met en route. Once there he takes up a job as a cow doctor in genetics and also carries on `practicing' on people as he is into growth hormones to `improve the race'. He is drawn to the young daughter of the family - Lilith - whom he says he can help develop as she was born prematurely and so has retarded growth and suffers bullying as a result. She in turn takes to the charismatic charmer but can't quite put her finger on why.

The family are at first wary of this German interloper, but German influence is quite high in that part of Argentina. Lilith and her brother are both sent to a German school and soon Herr Doctor is a regular fixture not only at their hotel but in their lives. What the family don't know is that they are harbouring `The Angel of Death' from Auschwitz - Dr Mengele.

This was written by Lucia Puenzo who also directs this and as such is a work of fiction, but it still deals with some of the nasty things that Nazi experimentation got up to; however this is still remarkably sanitised - only hinting at the depth of horror - but that is not a criticism. lex Brendemhl as Mengele manages to be both expert doctor and spine chillingly evil at the same time and by doing so bring a level of menace that very much brings the tension levels up. The setting is perfect (genuine location) too and most of the period detail is on the money. It is in Spanish and German and a bit of Hebrew with good sub titles. This is one for the story and atmosphere and as such can be recommended, but not if you get hung up on liberty's with history.",1421280000,5,1699,4.176829268292683

Most poignant is the fictional family and their daughter who is not ""Aryan Perfect"" and the Aryan school children's reaction to her and their persecution of her, (reminiscent of Nazi Germany).  The German population openly living in this fictitious community in S. America are eerily reminiscent  of the 1960s movie, ""The Village of the Damned "" with all those blue eyed children.

Can you believe it????

Lets make this simple. The German Doctor (2013) together with The Aura (2005) have become my two favorite Argentinian films.
The film was shot in Argentina (Patagonia), with the support of actors from Spain, Uruguay, and Argentina.  The movie looks very authentic
and it perfectly depicts the atmosphere of the times, which is Latin America in the mid-twenty century and its newly arriving immigration from Germany (former Third Reich).  Among the new arrivals is none other than: Josef Mengele. The year is 1960, and the Southern Argentinean territories are being populated with German diaspora which is establishing schools, clinics, hotels, stores, meeting halls, and is vigorously indoctrinating and ""Germanizing"" the old and new Argentinian Germans. The story centers around  the actual Historical persona, an infamous Butcher from Auschwitz, Dr. Mengele...(for some a medical genius, for others Dr. Satan)...I am not going to dwell into the historical/biographical aspect of Dr. Mengele for that I leave you Wikipedia or whatever source you use to find things out.  Alex Brendemuhl's portrayal of Mengele is just brilliant.  He is a Spanish actor with German ancestry who is bilingual in Spanish/English and has facial features resembling those of Mengele...perfectly cast in the role.  He was very original in that role.  If it was up to me, I would not hesitate giving him an Oscar for the best male leading role in a foreign production for the year 2013.

The movie revolves around Mengele and his interaction with an Argentinian/German family that has few kids, and one of them is a young girl who happens the catch the eye of Mengele.  The father of the family is Argentinian and the mother is of German stock.  The film contains lots of allusions to the so called pure Aryan race or the Master Race...begging with the young girl and Mengele's experimentation on her and ending on Mengele's interest and funding of ""identical"" doll production.

SPOILER ALERT:
However, the biggest aspect why this film made an everlasting impression on me is the fact that it is the first time I watched a movie about Nazis that ended well for them.  The jews lose in this one, or so one can get the impression.",1420329600,,2281,4.971052631578948

***SEE BELOW FOR BRIEF NOTES ON HISTORICAL CONTEXT & DOLL METAPHOR

Based on the book Wakolda by Lucia Puenzo.  For those looking for a quick paced, Nazi-hunter flick with a Hollywood type payoff in the end, this really isn't that kind of movie.  However, it is very compelling.  Like life, it doesn't work out how you intuitively think it should - because frankly it's based loosely on Mengele's actual life. I won't give anything away though the general history is known.  It is beautifully set in the wastelands and highlands of Patagonia with a palpable 1960 feel and wonderful cinematography.

THE PLOT:  Patagonia 1960. A young family falls in with a fellow traveler as they head across the wastelands and to their mountain resort where they will reopen a hotel set by a stunning alpine lake.  The father is Argentine and mother is of German decent, born in Argentina, raised at the resort, and schooled at a nearby school specifically for Germans.  The fellow traveler is also German and we come to learn he was a doctor, now experimenting with animal genetics and breeding.  The German doctor takes an eerie  interest in their 12 year old daughter Lilith who is beautiful for her imperfections, yet undeveloped for her age.  She was born premature and had developmental issues ever since.  We soon understand that his interest is clinical.  The mother is also pregnant and the doctor takes a substantial interest there as well when he learns she will have twins.  Though the father and boys in the family seem instinctively mistrusting, the mother, who speaks German, and Lilith are both very trusting if not drawn to him.  He begins giving the mother supplements and gains consent (from only the mother) to begin growth hormone treatment to the daughter.  This stretch of faith is facilitated by the fact Lilith is teased at school mercilessly for being smaller and undeveloped.  She is lured to the idea of being perfect.  Though we pretty much know this is Mengele by this point, we are not yet sure if he still has good intentions toward the family.  At the same time, there is a Mossad agent placed at the school who is on to Mengele and we see news reports of the 1960 capture of Adolf Eichmann, another notorious Nazi war criminal.  The noose is tightening on Mengele.

THE HAUNTING METAPHOR:  Though the father is initially wary, he is also brought into Mengele's web as the doctor takes an interest in the living dolls the man is designing.  They have porcelain faces with a mechanical heart that actually beats in their chest.  As the father tinkers to perfect his dolls, Mengele tinkers with his family to perfect his daughter and experiment with the twins.  Mengele actually assists the father by arranging a factory in the local area that can mass produce his perfect creation.  The dolls begin to roll off the production floor just as the story comes to a head.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:  The family is primarily a fictional device to create the metaphor with the dolls.  However, the historical context is quite good.  Mengele performed many jobs while on the run, both in Germany, Argentina and Paraguay.  This included being a farm hand and a carpenter.  However, Argentine government records also indicate he did in fact practice medicine without a license and it is believed he continued experiments to some degree.  Though the family is an illustration and not a fact, the overall story is quite true to the spirit of Mengele's exile.  The Mossad female agent is also a true person, though her situation at the school is fictional.  The story capitalizes on Mengele's history of genetic study and morbid obsession with twins to help weave the tale.

As I said, this is not a Hollywood type movie and in this case probably stronger for that fact.  The production values are outstanding and acting very well done.  There is a certain realistic feel that makes it possible for the viewer to place themselves in stead of the innocent family.  The movie is more powerful for that somewhat realistic sense.  If you go into it with the correct expectations, it will be exceptional in it's reward.  For those with different tastes, that's perfectly valid.  But the movie is masterfully done.",1414713600,,4377,4.840970350404312

The dolls begin to roll off the production floor just as the story comes to a head.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:  The family is primarily a fictional device to create the metaphor with the dolls.  However, the historical context is quite good.  Mengele performed many jobs while on the run, both in Germany, Argentina and Paraguay.  This included being a farm hand and a carpenter.  However, Argentine government records also indicate he did in fact practice medicine without a license and it is believed he continued experiments to some degree.  Though the family is an illustration and not a fact, the overall story is quite true to the spirit of Mengele's exile.  The Mossad female agent is also a true person, though her situation at the school is fictional.  The story capitalizes on Mengele's history of genetic study and morbid obsession with twins to help weave the tale.

As I said, this is not a Hollywood type movie and in this case probably stronger for that fact.  The production values are outstanding and acting very well done.  There is a certain realistic feel that makes it possible for the viewer to place themselves in stead of the innocent family.  The movie is more powerful for that somewhat realistic sense.  If you go into it with the correct expectations, it will be exceptional in it's reward.  For those with different tastes, that's perfectly valid.  But the movie is masterfully done.",1414713600,7,4377,4.840970350404312
8663553,4,B00L37J2FS,"A fictional account of Josef Mengele's later years set in Patagonia, Argentina.  No one really knows what Mengele was up to during the Nazi years because all of the eyewitnesses have died, were killed by Mossad or are part of the CIA-""Holocaust"" lie factory.  Thus, Mengele's prior history has been grossly distorted and alluded to in the movie as 'an obsession with twins for research experimentation.'  The movie does show, despite the distortion, that he was working with HGH, Human Growth Hormone, in bovine test animals.  This was long before its confirmed and widespread usage in both humans and cattle in the modern era. Suddenly, his supposed ""experimentation"" on humans doesn't seem so far-fetched, now that it is commonplace as HGH is used to restore youthful vigor in the aged (who can afford the treatments).  And, what is even more interesting, he apparently followed modern-day standard protocols in research by introducing HGH into the proper research animals first (such as cows) before using it on humans.  The movie makes a big deal out of Mossad hunting Mossad-designated ""criminals"", but since Mengele or any other Nazi official would never be offered a fair trial with real rules of evidence, it is not surprising that they all ran for their lives.  What would American officials have done if AMERICANS had LOST WWII?  Probably run and hide out in the Phillipines or some other location off the map, just as the Germans did.
The movie does confuse Germans in Patagonia, with Nazis in Patagonia, since German settlement in Argentina predates the Nazi era by at least 100 years.  Not all Germans living there were Nazis, obviously the Argentines benefit from this obvious smear by pretending it is 'history'.
As for the twins we encounter at the tail end of the movie, it is common practice for babies who are underweight to be given Karo syrup (glucose) in their formula, this was not an ""experiment"", but was an attempt to save the child's life--shame on the filmmakers for attempting to insert the claim this was some kind of weird case-control study.  Oh, and it was doubly proper to dilute cow's milk with water because cow's milk is not intended for human infants.
As for the theme of the dolls injected at the sequence in Patagonia, this doesn't show very much, maybe the doctor just wanted the father to realize his and his father-in-law's ambition to produce dolls for children.  Barbie, after all, first came out with just one mass-produced face to save production costs; why further distort this by attempting to make it seem like this is some kind of uniform, racial hygienic projection?",1532908800,,2618,4.927272727272728

Brendemuhl's performance as Mengele really stands out, along with the beautiful mountains and countryside of the Argentine land. He journals compulsively about growth hormones, genetic, and comparative biology, hiding his genuine intentions from the family he goes out of his way to help. In the end his intentions are revealed, in part by a bug-eyed librarian who is an undercover Israeli agent.

8663556,3,B00L37J2FS,"This is a good movie about the evil Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele residing in Argentina conducting his life as a doctor . He befriends a family and engages in radical medical treatment of women and babies. Though there were many Nazi's escaping to South America, not much effort was spent by the allies to capture them until the Israeli's started their own campaign. But the story is about how an evil murderer could blend into a foreign society and take refuge under the cover of community of German ex-pats.  The acting by the lead character (Alex Brendemhl) is superb and deserves 4.5 stars. The rest of the cast's performance is not so stellar.  There are also some flaws in the plot and sequencing of the scenes, some with no direct consequence to subsequent scenes. The cinematography is very good showing beautiful scenery of Patagonia. It is an entertaining movie to watch, and unlike the American movies, lacks the distracting musical soundtrack through most of the movie, thus allowing the dialog to dominate and set the tone for every scene. The movie can be categorized as a mild thriller.",1505260800,,1098,4.835106382978723
8663557,4,B00L37J2FS,"Wakolda ( The German Doctor) is an interesting film about what one of the Nazis( Joseph Mengele) who escaped to South America did( based on the writer/directors creation). The true story of an Argentine family who lived with Josef Mengele without knowing his true identity, and of a girl who fell in love with one of the biggest criminals of all times. From the start theres the uneasiness of an older man showing such interest in a young girl. The film tells you who this character is from very early on, so the film builds tension and suspense. Hes now known as Helmut Gregor (Alex Brendemuhl) practising as a vetenary surgeon on cattle. The audience is uncertain what is going to happen, as the narrator is the young girl Lilith (Florencia Bado). What are his motives? We see this man through the eyes of the family, as he gets to know them and insinuate himself. The film cleverly seems to humanise him into a complex character. He seems to have a true concern for the child; she has warmed to him like an uncle figure. Lilith just wants to fit in, her mother Eva (Natalia Oreiro) wants a normal child, in the German community of Bariloche, where she is classed as a dwarf, due to being born premature, picked on by a group of students. Eva is willing to deceive her husband Enzo (Diego Peretti) by allowing Gregor to supervise her latest pregnancy and ply Lilith with growth hormones. Although Enzo is suspicious of the suave interloper, he is seduced by an offer to help mass produce porcelain dolls he fabricates in his workshop.

The story builds a sense of menace with the character of the photographer (a Mossad Agent) who stealthily takes photos of Gregor and informs agencies where he is. Theres also the sense of hydroplanes flying in and out with unknown visitors. A contrast in scenery between Lake Nahuel Huapi and the closed in secretive notebooksof the doctor. The thriller literally takes off from Liliths exploration of Gregors lab, sightings of the notebook entries, the investigations of the Mossad agent, and the psychology of the community that protected such criminals. The school has a bullying culture derived from Nazism. The visual setting is startling, as is the hotel itself. Lucia Puenzo uses a subtlety of approach, underplaying explanations, portraying the girl and her relationship with the main character perfectly. A brilliantly written film, with good acting of the chief character, the girl and the photographer( Elena Roger).",1503964800,,2465,4.869047619047619
