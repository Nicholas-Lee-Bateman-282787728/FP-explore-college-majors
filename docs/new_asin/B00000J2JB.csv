1231460,5,B00000J2JB,"This was a very entertaining holiday movie. Jonathan Taylor Thomas (Jake)plays a college student who has his test cheating scheme thwarted by a rival, and the would be cheatees exact revenge by leaving Jake out in the  desert, penniless, wearing only a Santa costume. This leaves him in danger  of losing a Porsche that his desperate father used as a last ditch bribe to  get him home for Christmas. Jake soon learns his huge ego isn't going to  get him out of this predicament.  Adam LaVorgna, (Eddie) who plays Jake's  arch rival in the movie, stole many a scene. LaVorgna could easily have  played the title role, but Jonathan Taylor Thomas, of Home Improvement  fame, is more of a household name. Adam LaVorgna is a very talented actor  who hopefully will get more lead roles as his acting career progresses.  Walt Disney has done it again, making another great family movie that all  ages can enjoy.",943920000,6,904,4.730769230769231

1231468,4,B00000J2JB,"Before purchasing this DVD, I would like to point something out. I've noticed other people have been complying about this as well. When you first play the movie, for some reason, the language is in Spanish. This happened to me when I first watched the film. But, if you need to change the language on the DVD, all you have to do is go to the DVD's main menu, go to 'Set -Up' options and you can change the language to English. I am not sure why the DVD starts off in Spanish and I know it has upset a lot of people, so much that some have returned or plan to return the DVD. So, I thought I would post this to help some people out. Thanks for reading.",1514160000,,651,4.015384615384615

Jonathan Taylor Thomas' desires to get home just to be given a Porsche is selfish and self-centered. The side characters are annoying and/or bully like, and the things that J.T.T. does in order to get through his journey such as make up a fake liver donor box on a crowded bus. The worst part is J.T.T.'s character isn't a character that the audience could feel passion or hate for considering that J.T.T. does not portray a ""jerk character"" well especially when he has done so many bad deeds over good deeds. The acting is 2nd rate (especially for one actor). The writing is 5th rate and I'm being nice. The only good actor in the whole film is the vulture. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1482192000,,773,4.375

I like her ""okay"" in it, enough that I don't get all jealous of her for getting to co-star with JTT as his love interest. lol.  This movie is very Merry & the moral of the story is that no matter what challenges your family is going through, you need to be home for Christmas to spend it with the ones who love you most in life---and JTT's character learns he needs to yearn for them too, forgive, get over some things, and just---be home for Christmas, a time when that ""togetherness"" is a real comfort, a time to reunite & feel close again.

1231702,5,B00000J2JB,"I'll Be Home For Christmas is your typical fluffy holiday movie.  If you don't like fluffy, feel good movies with happy endings, chances are you won't like this movie.

But, for those of us who aren't quite so cynical, this movie is pretty good.  I don't really care for Jessica Biel's acting ability, so that's basically my only issue with it.  On the other hand, I felt Jonathan Taylor Thomas (J.T.T. as he was known as by my teenybopper sister back in his heyday) was perfect in his role.  (What ever happened to that kid?)

Anyway, J.T.T. plays Jake, a college (or prep school, not sure which) student, who is trying to get home for Christmas because if he does so, he gets his dad's vintage Porsche.  Not only does Jake have the Porsche over his head, he also needs to make good with his girlfriend Ally, who after being stood up by Jake, takes up an offer of a trip back east with Jake's archenemy, Eddie.

What follows is Jake's cross-country journey where he runs into one adventure after another all the while being dressed in a Santa suit.  All of which we found to be pretty entertaining!  Of course, he eventually makes it home and he fixes his relationship with Ally and all is happy by the time the closing credits role.  Ah, aren't these predictable holiday movies great?  I love them.

I'd recommend this for families with children of most ages.  My four-year-old actually watched this movie the whole way through.  That's impressive!",1131321600,10,1450,4.609375
1231703,2,B00000J2JB,"Jake has no interest in coming home for Christmas and spending it with his dad, sister, and step-mother.  But when his father promises him a Porsche if he's there by Christmas Eve dinner, Jake decides to spend the holidays with them.  Only things aren't that simple.  A scheme to help some jocks cheat on a final backfires, and he finds himself in the desert in a Santa costume.  Now, he must use all his wits to get from California to New York before the deadline.
I remember thinking this film would be fun when it first came out.  I was wrong then, and watching it again didn't change my mind.  The problem is with Jake.  Watching the guy lie and scheme his way across the country for an hour and a half to get a car is hard to watch.  You're supposed to be rooting for him, but he's so despicable you want him to fail.  And his supposed change of heart at the end is too little too late to redeem him.  Because of this, the funny situations along the way aren't as funny because you don't care about the character.
Frankly, I find this disappointing because I do enjoy Jonathon Taylor Thomas's work.  He's a good actor, but he can't raise the level of the comedy above poor.  If you want to get into the spirit of the season, skip this and watch many of the other, better holiday themed movies available.  You'll be glad you did.",1071446400,11,1333,4.305220883534137
1231704,3,B00000J2JB,"In 1998, movie makers came out with another Christmas classic and it was phenomenal. Johnathan Taylor Thomas played an excellent role in this film as the teenage Santa Claus. The movie is funny, hilarious and full of holiday fun. Your Christmas collection isn't complete without this.
The movie starts out in California at college where we meet Jake (Thomas) who is planning a vacation on the beach with his girlfriend (Jessica Biel) instead of going home like she wants to. So when Jake calls his family and tells him he's not planning on coming home, his father (Gary Cole) bribes him to come home. He promises Jake if he comes home, he can have the Porsche his father restored. Now he's going home! The problem is, his college rivals play a prank on him and leave him stranded in the desert with nothing and wearing a Santa costume.
So to get home, he hitches a ride with a theif who almost killed him with his van while Jake was walking on the side of the road. Then he comes accross a cop who asks Jake for help in getting his wife back. Jake does it because the cop promises to give him a bus ticket home if he succeeds. It's hilarious how Jake does it. Then, while at the bus station, Jake sees on TV his girlfriend with Eddie, who stranded him in the desert. ""I'll kill him!"" So he chases down Eddie and then ends up stranded again. So he enters a Santa Claus race and the winner gets money. Of course Jake wins because he's competing against old fats guys.
I'll let you see the rest. How will he find a way to get home? ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" is a holiday classic. Johnathan Taylor Thomas played the best role of his career to date in this movie. He was funny and hilarious. The movie really gets you into the holiday spirit. It always worked for me and it will work for you. Merry Christmas!",1071014400,8,1807,4.349112426035503

1231706,4,B00000J2JB,"""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" stars Jonathan Taylor Thomas (of TV's ""Home Improvement"" fame), Jessica Biel (of TV's ""7th Heaven"" fame), Adam LaVorgna (also of TV's ""7th Heaven"" fame), and Gary Cole (of TV's ""Family Affair"" fame).
PLOT SUMMARY: In ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"", Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays Jake, a very minipulative student at a university in Los Angeles. His girlfriend, Alley (Biel), wants to go home for Christmas so she can spend the holiday with her family. Jake, on the other hand, wants to vacation with her somewhere tropical, away from his family--his father, played by Gary Cole, just got remarried ten months after Jake's mother died, and Jake isn't too happy about that. As a last chance for a desparate attempt to get Jake to come home, his father bribes him by telling Jake he can have the red Porsche car they had been working on, only if he can get home at exactly 6:00pm on Christmas Eve. Jake has already changed his plane tickets that his father sent him for New York, and Jake wants nothing more than the car. So greedily, he tries to get his girlfriend to come home with him, but she sees he doesn't really want to go home. When Eddie (LaVorgna), Jake's arch rival who also likes Alley, finds out that Jake is helping some jocks cheat on a test, he stops Jake's friend from helping them, and then tells the jocks that Jake did it on purpose so they would fail. Of course, the jocks get angry and want revenge. So, at a party, they confront him, and leave Jake stranded out in the middle of nowhere wearing nothing but a Santa Clause suit and pennieless. Now, it's up to Jake to find his way home so he can get the car...and he'll do whatever it takes--even if it's riding in a car with a bunch of old ladies or competiting in a Santa Clause race to win $1,000! Meanwhile, back at college, Eddie sees that Alley needs a lift home and offers her one. Reluclantly, Alley agrees. And while Jake is on the road, several times, he encounters Eddie and Alley and gets jealous at seeing the two of them together.
OVERALL THOUGHTS: ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"" is a very funny film. The acting is great from the entire cast--especially Jonathan Taylor Thomas; he shines in the starring role. The storyline is light hearted and well-written. The special effects are good and the directing is excellent. This a good wholesome, family film, because it shows the true meaning of Christmas, while your family can laugh away at all the crazy things Jake does to try and get home. The DVD doesn't include much in the way of extras, and it is available in wide screen format.
I highly recommend ""I'll Be Home For Christmas"".

1231707,2,B00000J2JB,"This is definitely not a Christmas classic. The actors/ actresses were extremely superficial in their parts. First of all, the script was a standard Jr. High style script that offers very little real life dialogue. Secondly, the character's interaction with one another seemed rather... acted. That may sound good, but when you can tell that actors/ actresses are acting, you have a dull, unbelievable movie.

1231710,5,B00000J2JB,"This is Jonathan Taylor Thomas's last movie before leaving for college. I'm sure he'll be back in the business once he graduates, but until then, this is what we have to remember him by. And I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS is great and totally excellent. It's about a college student named Jake (JTT) who has to get home to New York City for Christmas. When some arch rivals play a prank on him, leaving him in the middle of a desert wearing a Santa Clause suit and with no money or way home, he must find his way home so he can be home in time for Christmas to be with his girlfriend (Jessica Biel) and his family. I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS is a fun, romantic comedy for the entire family. It's fun to see how Jake actually does get home. If you're a JTT fan, you must see this movie. Adam LaVorgna (who can be seen now on TV's ""7th Heaven"" with Jessica Biel, who also stars on ""7th Heaven""), is also great in this film. The acting is terrific, and the storyline is cool, too. Definitely see I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS - one of the best holiday films in a long time!",991699200,6,1063,4.165048543689321
1231711,2,B00000J2JB,"This must be the worst holiday movie I've ever seen. Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays a college student who gets left in a desert with a Santa suit ""glued"" to him because his classmates wanted to get even. But he has to get home because his dad promised to give him a Porche if he was there on Christmas eve. Of course he needs to win his girl back on the way.
 Everything about this movie seems like it was made for TV. There are some really funny parts but they can't save it. Why would you buy this when there are so many other holiday movies that are far better? The Santa Clause, Jingle All The Way, Home Alone, Home Alone 2 and many others make this movie look stupid. If you have to own every Christmas movie out there, then buy the VHS version since you're only going to watch it twice a year.",976060800,2,797,4.141935483870967
1231712,5,B00000J2JB,"I loved this movie, and no Im not some 12 yr old girl with a crush on jtt, I just think hes an awsome actor. Its about a colledge kid, Jake who needs to get home for Christmas if he wants his dad's porshe. But all of a sudden he wakes in a dedert wearing the santa uniform, then he starts the adventure home.",972691200,2,308,3.828125
1231713,1,B00000J2JB,"I saw this movie with my best friend last year for one reason: Someone I know actually told me that it was a great Christmas movie. So we went to  see it. From the moment it started, I knew this wasn't going to be a  Christmas classic. For one thing, it's supposed to take place in a college  somewhere in L.A. For some reason, none of the teenagers in the movie even  look like college students, they communicate with one another often using  corny phrases such as, ""Am I witnessing an overage of niceness  here?"", and, ""If you try to feel me up, I am going to SLUG  you!"". I don't know anyone who talks like that, and I doubt that  anyone does. There are so many things that are terribly wrong in this  movie. For one thing, the plot revolves around this guy named Jake  (Jonathon Taylor Thomas) who thinks he rules the universe. He is a snob,  and everyone knows it, even his girlfriend. But, anyways, Jake's dad calls  him up the day before Christmas and begs for him to come over for the  holidays. Jake claims that he has more important things to do. Thats pretty  low. His dad makes a pact with him. If he can make it home on Christmas  Eve, his dad will give him the Porsce. He calls it a deal, and says that he  will be there. What a nice son...NOT! The whole time I was thinking,  ""YOU IDIOT""! I know that if my parents wanted me to visit them on  the holidays, I would drop everything I was doing, and I most definitly  would go. But, Jake has a little problem. He forgot to give these students  the answers to the school quiz that they were having. He had promised them  that he would help them cheat. He forgets. They catch him, glue a Santa hat  and beard onto his head, and throw him out into the middle of the desert.  How sweet. How jolly. Anyways, Jake goes through hell and high water to get  home, all the while learning the true meaning of Christmas! Awwww! I guess  you already know how this is going to turn out, so I'll stop there. Just be  prepared for bad acting, a bad plot, and goofs anyone can point out. Theres  enough for everyone!",965865600,2,2062,4.220512820512821

1231715,5,B00000J2JB,"I'll be home for christmas is a great movie to watch during Christmas. I found that JTT played his character as 'Jake' well he was 'funny and imaginative' during those bad luck times he had gotten into during the  movie. Other actors such as jake's girlfriend , eddie, and jake's sister  were the most remembered characters. Call me stupid but I would have had  Tim Allen Play the Father maybe because i have been watching too much home  improvement i expect Tim to pop out. you know instead of the the porsche it  could of been the 'Hot Rod' Tim and Jonathan were building During Home  improvement. But in summary a great movie to watch during Xmas.",947116800,3,650,4.512820512820513
