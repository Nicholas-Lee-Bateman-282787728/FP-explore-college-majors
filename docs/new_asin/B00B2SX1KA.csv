You will find yourself revisiting many of the topics and exercises over and over. Follow the instructions on training, riding position, and theory and you and your horse will improve.
I also found the brief History of the American Forward Riding System very interesting. Great historic photos!
I highly recommend the American Hunter/Jumper Forward Riding System DVD Collection.",1364256000,,545,5.566265060240964

Loved seeing the evolution of riding styles and learning more about the legendary people who helped shape riding into what it is today. The video is also a great tool for visual learning and for book ideas to learn more about different riding and horsemanship philosophy. The information on training, riding position, and theory is also extremely valuable. Definitely worth watching!!",1363737600,,465,5.131578947368421
8561621,5,B00B2SX1KA,"This DVD set is absolutely awesome, it covers everything from proper use of leg and rein aids to how to improve and strengthen a riders position (leg, seat and balance) while explaining how and when to use different seats and releases over fences. It also features a section on training your horse, that is divided into 3 chapters so you can choose which fits you and your horse's experience level. Personally I found the basic level was full of great exercises for my green horses. My favorite part and the most eye opening part of this set was the introduction, I really loved how it went into the history behind how modern riding developed. I always wondered how it went from those old photos of leaning backwards over jumps to the 'forward' position. So great to see the progression of the sport! Plus the vintage video clips and photos were so cool!",1362528000,,854,4.625
