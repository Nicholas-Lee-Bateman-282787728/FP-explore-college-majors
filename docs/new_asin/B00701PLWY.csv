Here's the scoop. A young medical student comes across a dead body in the woods. He takes it home to study it. When he finds out it's the son of a high ranking official, he hires a low rent private eye to investigate so he doesn't get tagged for the murder. The investigation leads them down some dark and crazy avenues.

This Korean yarn seems to be set in the 20s or 30s and does contain some anachronisms, but it's loaded to the gills. It's a crime/mystery thriller. It's a comedy. It contains political intrigue, a serial killer, human trafficking, drug trafficking, pedophilia. The list goes on. And it's a thrill to watch. This out and out riot of a film even has touches of the surreal. It's beautiful to watch and the characters are great. One woman, who helps in the investigation, is a secret scientist. She's afraid to show her colors because, as a woman, she'll be scorned. She looks to the west, America, where she can study and invent freely, making this an ahead of it's time statement on women's rights. The sets and costumes are great. The music score is a hoot. Though Korean, much of it is Tango and 'South of the Border' inspired. The plot keeps you guessing. Something happens that suggested I was seeing the end, but then I realized there were still 30 minutes left and I couldn't figure what could possibly be left to the story. There was plenty. The director, Dae-min Park, has only one credit on IMDB. I'm certain this couldn't be his first and only film. It is too accomplished a work for someone's first time at bat.

This is one of the best films I've ever seen and it displays a true joy of the medium. If you're a bonafide film fan, this is a must see.",1363564800,7,1757,4.383435582822086
8507414,5,B00701PLWY,"A young medical student, Gwang-soo, finds a dead body in the woods and takes it home to practice. Eventually, he realizes the corpse is the son of a powerful government official. Afraid of being accused of murder, Gwang-soo hires Jin-ho, a witty private investigator who usually investigates cheating wives, to clear his name. Private Eye is a funny, exciting, and captivating mystery film; another gem from South Korea.

The story in Private Eye is great; it is filled with genuinely funny dialogue, amazing chase and fight scenes, and great twists. I really love how this film balances all of these elements to keep the audience on its feet; it never leans too far into a single genre. This allowed the film to move at a steady, consistent pace, so it never overstays its welcome. I really enjoyed the twists in this film, although they may be a bit predictable depending on how much experience you have with mysteries. The acting is great; Hwang Jung-min played Hwang Jung-min with great charisma. The film is shot beatifully, and many of the scenes had great choreography. The music was amazing, definitely matched the setting and atmosphere. I'm sure you've heard a story like this before, especially if you're already interested in mystery stories, but this one is still worth watching for its style and entertainment.

Overall, Private Eye blends many elements into a well-balanced mystery film; it is thoroughly entertaining and captivating. As of 12/29/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but I HIGHLY recommend a purchase.

Private Eye has strong violence and blood, and a brief sex scene (no nudity).",1359590400,5,1624,5.029739776951673
