8266752,5,B0017OQPJI,Another funny one for Dennis Swanberg. He is so good at what he does. I believe anyone would enjoy this dvd.,1378857600,,108,4.190476190476191
8266753,5,B0017OQPJI,"It was very refreshing.  Glad to hear a good Southern Baptist minister can be a ""man of God"" as well as a comedian.",1374364800,,115,4.0
8266754,4,B0017OQPJI,AWESOME PASTOR WITH GREAT STORIES AND HE WILL GIVE YOU A SMILE. MANY DVDS OF THE SWANBERG AND I PLAN TO CHECK ON MORE AND BUY MORE,1373241600,,130,3.8518518518518516
8266755,5,B0017OQPJI,This has been an excellent DVD to use in both Sunday School classes and Bible Studies.  God does have a sense of humor and both Christians and non Christians will enjoy this.,1333238400,,174,4.4375
8266756,2,B0017OQPJI,Just a hodge-podge of video clips poorly done.  I would have liked one event with a collection of his best jokes in one evening instead of edited events.,1309737600,,153,4.464285714285714
8266757,5,B0017OQPJI,"I bought this as a gift for my dad whose love language is definitely humor.  He loved it.  I know he'll be telling some of the stories and jokes to his neighbors--that's my dad! I also bought it for him because while ""The Swan"" is yucking it up he slips in very meaningful, scripturally-based messages that strike right at the core at what Christ wants us to know/learn/do.  We could all use these reminders, but my dad sometimes needs a little push and humor helps make the medicine go down, in his particular case.  I also admire so much how Dennis honors his parents--he has inpsired me to do that increasingly more through his example.  I'm so grateful to God for Dennis Swanberg's gift of delivering the Word of God for people like my dad (and me, too! I love the humor as well!).",1249603200,9,785,4.423611111111111
8266758,5,B0017OQPJI,"We've purchased about 6 or 7 of Dennis Swanberg's videos and they are all side splitting funny, but we've also seen him in person and he's even better that way! We highly recommend anyone to purchase as many of his videos as the budget will allow.  [...]",1249084800,8,254,4.404255319148936
