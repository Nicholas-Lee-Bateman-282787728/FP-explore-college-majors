1690188,5,B000063J8W,"Once again, Hercules goes out on its third season romp.  This is the season when it realized its full potential, and ranks second only to season 5.  The shows put out in the third season range from comedy to romance to intense drama.  The Golden Hind trilogy included in this season is worth the price of admission alone.
More new characters appear, including the first of many fine performances by Kevin Smith as Ares; Karl Urban starts his role as Cupid; Sam Jenkins-Sorbo appears as Hercules' second lost love, Serena; and Xena (Lucy Lawless), Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor), and Joxer (Ted Raimi) cross-over from ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" for the very first time.
Take hold of this set, as it will take until the fifth season for the show to regain the glory it gained this season.",1073606400,10,780,4.762962962962963
1690189,5,B000063J8W,This is the first season of Hercules where we really get into some bravado. Herc and Iolaus really start coming into their own. The stories get more involved and the producers became more risky. A must buy for any Hercules fan.,1073347200,3,227,4.560975609756097

We all agree that Hercules (Kevin Sorbo) is the character who comes closest to being believable  He is just too cool under pressure.

He ain't hard to look at, either!  I feel so sorry for him, knowing that he was performing while in severe pain of his illness.",1367280000,,396,4.52112676056338

1690269,5,B000063J8W,"What I really enjoyed about the Hercules series in the past when I first saw it and today is that it was pure fun with some moral guidelines thrown in.  The show was never afraid to poke fun at itself while dabbling in some mythology. I loved how they would allude to the creation of things we see and use in our daily lives, i.e., McDonald's, watches, the olympics, taco, ambrosia, etc. In a word - fun.",1355184000,,404,4.246753246753247
1690270,4,B000063J8W,"I would give this 5 stars if not for a defect in the manufacturers disc 4 & 5. I originally purchased the entire box set from outside of Amazon and every disc was fine except for 2 disc in season 3, it was disc 4 & disc 5 that had some skips and even one episode that completely failed to play on disc 5. I am somewhat of a perfectionist and wanted the entire collection to be in perfect working order so I bit the bullet and ordered season 3 from Amazon, it turns out the set from Amazon(not directly from Amazon but a reseller) had the same exact problems as my original box set right down to the very second it begins to skip. I noticed there is a 5 disc version so decided to take a chance and order it, turns out it is from a different manufacturer so I was able to get a good copy. The 5 disc version just doesn't have the extras that's in the 8 disc version but it does contain every episode. As for the content, well I absolutely love the Hercules collection and although some seasons are better than others Season 3 is a great one that left me wanting more.",1353283200,,1066,4.080952380952381
1690271,5,B000063J8W,"I had received season one of Hercules as a gift and immediately became nostalgic for the happy times and memories when this TV program was on Saturday's and we made sure not to miss one episode.  I wanted to add this series to my DVD collection, so once again turned to Amazon.com and ordered Season Two and Season Three, which were both on sale.  Now I get to watch an episode whenever I feel stressed or just want light hearted, ""the hero wins the day"" entertainment.  I plan on purchasing the other seasons as well, but want to wait until they go on sale on Amazon.  Don't hesitate to make this series part of your collection, it brings memories of happier times and beats all the ""Reality TV"" nonsense that people now call entertainment these days.",1350864000,,752,4.507352941176471
1690272,5,B000063J8W,Great series but do not expect this to look good on a high def television. They were not filmed in HD so they look hideous on the HD screen. Good family fun.,1339804800,,157,3.9375

1690274,1,B000063J8W,I'm thrilled to say my teenage son is far more interested in what he considers old classics than the newer series. He has slowly been collecting all available seasons of several of the older series and was beyond excited to receive the third season of Hercules. Unfortunately he was equally disappointed to find that instead of the entire set of discs from season 3 he had two of disc 1 and no disc 3. As my receipt was lost in the shuffle of Christmas chaos I've been unable to locate a copy of the third disc without buying the entire set again.,1326758400,2,547,4.372549019607843

1690279,3,B000063J8W,"I wanted to like Hercules series because it seems, fun, campy, heroic and seemingly has diversity in it. As a fantasy for adults who already have a moral core, it's great and it gave us Xena one of the first and best female heroic warriors, so that alone is worth watching. Herc has a good, cheerful vibe, and reminds me of the old shows they used to have on TV  - Lone Ranger, Zorro and other heroic saviors. Both series had problems though and, on closer inspection some of the mythology in Hercules is kind of repellent. I watched the movie not too long ago and was interested how unbelievably sexist some of the myths and themes are. Which is typical of rewritten Greco/Roman myth, which I like to study about.

For instance, in the Herc show I saw recently (one of the movie spin-offs from the series), Zeus was portrayed as a sad-eyed noble, and his wife a jealous, vindictive harpy out to kill poor, heroic Hercules. In Greek mythology, however, Zeus was a rapist and a vile monster who originally wasn't a god, but was apparently eventually deified. Kids watching this show and reading the myths in further study might be very confused as to the true nature of Heroism. Further confusion results when there is a close father/son relationship in some of the story-lines. If Herc thinks his rapist father is kindly and nobly is he just ignorant? Or is he evil and accepts a brotherhood of rape, as anyone who lives in a fascist patriarchal system has an uneasy feeling is the case of some of our pretend heroes. Our own culture trends this way. Our religion, like Greek religion, talks about love and goodness, yet practices child sacrifice and torture, animal sacrifice in the old testament and takes away liberty and dignity from women - as well as commands women to have no authority and to be subject in all things. Women suffer greatly often in secret since they are threatened and also commanded ""women be silent"" as per the bible. It also worships the creators which means you'd have to worship those who created predators - an inherently evil act. To question those who claim to be gods is a good practice. Usually they are corrupt men who are unjust and greedy for power and dominance over others.

So yeah, kids would be better off learning to think critically about myths and learning to be true heroes - by defying corrupt power, trying to be kind and gentle to animals, the poor and enslaved, women who have no authority in a culture where religion, the military, police and government is created and entirely ruled over by corrupt men and secret brotherhoods like religious sects, Catholicism, Christianity, Freemasonry etc.... If I seem to be thinking too much about was is apparently just a fun myth, I don't really think so. In large part, I think children learn about truth and morality from our stories and especially our ""heroic"" ones. Teaching your kids to really think about what is truly heroism, or not, is giving them a great gift. I believe that we are losing our heart muscle by not being aware of the myths and religions that are actually monstrous. Is Hercules a hero? Maybe he doesn't know what his father has done, perhaps he is unaware that the mother is demonized while the monster of a father is deified. Another notable thing is when Herc is captured by Amazons who are quite angry (understandably since the people are worshipping a rapist) and resisting a cruel, corrupt, patriarchal world, Herc gives them a little sermon about how bad they are etc... and the upshot is they are easily brought around to his way of thinking. The irony is the way the Amazons treated the men is probably a type of justice and not unlike how women are treated in any patriarchal culture. Zeus makes a horrible appearance as well and it's uh... disturbing to say the least, he's quite old at this point and has some sort of sexual liaison with an Amazon - symbolic of their defeat to a vile monstrous ""god"" and his easy excuses and propaganda. Ugh. Amazons should never be defeated if they oppose an evil culture, it is the triumph of evil not goodness. They are effectively de-moralized and defeated somehow, because they let Herc tell them they were bad girls for seeking justice for the same things Herc's culture and ""god father"" regularly does to women. So.... again, it would be confusing to people who fall in love with Greek mythology that the myths are so, well...un-heroic sometimes.

On a bright note, taken as just a fantasy or story, it's fun and you can make it good by making it your own. For instance when I imagine the story of Hercules, I imagine Zeus is not there or not joined by Hercules, I make up my own myths as I watch - it's a strange thing, but I love joining in the stories this way. Because I love Greek and Roman mythology, I'd rewrite all the myths myself, if I could, and would have great fun doing it. When I was a kid, me and my brother would just play these games out - we played Greek myths even then, and they were whatever we wanted them to be. Kids have no problem with this and if we had their flexibility could easily transform all the ugly religions into new things. Adults are so inflexible and always think of a thousand reasons why you can't do that, it's frustrating and boring. I'd like to have a round table of Gods and Goddesses with Zeus notably absent and Apollo and Artemas (my own spelling) taking his place, their archery a symbol of reaching goals instead of the traditional killing and hunting. Today, reason, civilization and healing (Apollo and Athene) and love (Aphrodite), the warmth of home and hearth (Hestia) and protection (Artemas) would combine and we would protect animals, children, good men and women without needing the traditional hunting motifs. I like playing with these ideas as I watch. if you wanted to, you could create these stories with your kids and try to make them a reality by engaging in human and women's rights, animal rights, children's rights as part of the process. Make your kids real heroes (but not sacrifices - protect them, do not kill your heroes like some people demand.) Another thing I liked about Herc was the costumes and cheesy special effects. I wish they would capture the suffering animals with ingenuity instead of destroy them as in the movie, though. True heroism would be more fun and creative - as well as more victorious.",1295568000,,6354,4.620353982300885
1690280,5,B000063J8W,"I love season 3 some of my fav season 3 episodes are the golden hind episodes showing Hercules falling in love and then losing her. Also SURPRISE bring Callisto into the Hercules world, and seeing Kevin Smith as Ares in Hercules for the first time.
Season 3 is still full of great moments, great acting in this great show",1287014400,,321,4.4576271186440675

1690282,5,B000063J8W,Excellent season for anyone that is a fan of the series.  The extras have plenty of behind the scenes information.  Hours of fun entertainment for people of all ages.,1286236800,,166,4.689655172413793
1690283,5,B000063J8W,"This show is a must see for those who appreciate tweaking with familiar myth.  I'm a professor of College English and use some of these shows in my discussions of mythology, as they are a fun way to explore myth.",1244505600,,212,4.3
1690284,5,B000063J8W,"Well, where to start. For one this is one of the best seasons to this show and that this is the first time that a good actor Kevin Smith (Ares) makes his debut to role as Ares upon which was alot better than the actor in Season 1 who did Ares, but it was the show's' earlier debuts which made it worthwhile to watch. Mercenary, Mummy Dearest, Surprise, The Golden Hind Trilogy, Reign Of Terror, End Of The Beginning, A Rock and a Hard Place, Atlantis were the good episodes of this series.

In ""Mummy Dearest"" when Hercules (Kevin Sorbo) fought the Mummy in the prison cell, the stunts that Kevin did in this battle were amazing that you may find yourself watching it over and over again without getting tired of it! Kevin loved the episode ""Mercenary"" the most which was directed by Michael Hurst. This episode alone is the reason to buy this box set. This episode takes you on an adventure where both Hercules and a Mercenary knowing good survival skills at first has trouble getting along, but later in the episode when they are on the brink of being attacked by Sandsharks and pirates , that alone is what got them to work together, and even got them to know each other a little better. Hercules is a lovable guy and even spared the Mercenary's life when he was going to get sentenced to death. ""Surprise"" was a nice episode for the first time ever having Hudson Leick (Callisto) starring in one of Kevin's Sorbos episodes which is also a great episode for Xena fans to see. The Golden Hind Trilogy ""Encounter"", ""When a Man loves a woman"", and ""Judgement Day"" were great episodes who had a great actress, Sam as Serena who is actually Kevin Sorbos wife in rl star in these episodes to not be forgotten. End Of The Beginning was a nice episode featuring time travel and that out of all of the episodes to this series, this episode is probably most heartwarming out of the rest which for example Serena and Autolycus (Bruce Campbell) (Young) would forget their memories once Herc and Autolycus (older) went back to the present, though the episode is a little sad because of that, but Serena finds a new husband and lives a great life upon which touched Herc's heart knowing that what he did was right. A Rock and a Hard Place probably is the most serious episode of the season. It's about a guy who is trapped in a cave and accused of murder. For those who play Phoenix Wright games, this episode is a must watch. ""Atlantis"" This is probably the third best episode in the season. It features a great actress Claudia Black who did great rolling as a gentle young woman named Cassandra who can see visions within people knowing what's going to happen later in the future. Despite her beauty, she isn't exactly liked by much folks in her area, because they think that she is a crazy witch who is just either pulling pranks, threatening them, or is trying to scare them with her visions. Hercules was the only person that believed her and probably is the only friend that she has and that saying that they will be friends for a long time is what makes this episode so heartwarming.

Alright, all I'll have to say is that this box set is certainly a nice addition to your DVD set collection.",1241568000,,3188,4.475945017182131

1690287,4,B000063J8W,"The first two seasons of HERCULES were pretty much just a decent kid's show.  Narratively the only thing of consequence was the emergence of Xena as a character prior to her spin off.  The core problem with HERCULES was that the show contained no significant conflict.  While Hercules had suffered mightily at the hand of Hera, losing his family, he is a remarkably decent, nice guy.  Kevin Sorbo managed to make this Hercules likable, but he was unable, given the writing on the show, to make him complex or especially interesting.  To be fair, XENA had the same problem until they introduced the ""Dark Xena"" background stories, which made the Xena of the present infinitely more interesting.  But HERCULES never made an equivalent transition and as a result never became particularly compelling.

Nonetheless, beginning about halfway through Season Three HERCULES became far more interesting.  Much of this resulted from an influx of characters and storylines from XENA.  The Ares who had been introduced on XENA shifted over to HERCULES (Kevin Smith had already been on XENA as Ares, but on HERCULES he was already familiar as Hercules' brother Iphicles).  Xena and Gabrielle even made it over for an episode while Joxer even made one of his few appearances on the senior show.  Aphrodite made a couple of nice appearances as Amanda Tyddings pulled double duty on both shows, but the best XENA crossover was the first of several excellent appearances by Hudson Leick as Callisto.  This would begin a formula that would greatly intensify in the final three seasons of HERCULES, as the two shows would often share recurring characters, in particular Autolycus, Ares, Aphrodite, and Callisto, as well as several lesser characters.

While HERCULES never achieved the excellence of many of XENA's best moments, neither did it succumb to its abuses.  If one loves ancient history then XENA is at times embarrassing and frequently profoundly annoying.  HERCULES delves into history far less frequently, though it takes, perhaps, even more liberties with mythology.  And while I find the frequent fight scenes on HERCULES far less absurd than the Hong Kong inspired fighting on XENA, it was also less imaginative, partly due to Kevin Sorbo doing much of his own stunt work, while on XENA Lucy Lawless was able to hand over to the wondrous Zo Bell the more extreme stunts.

The biggest disappointment about Season Three was, in a way, the final episode, ""Atlantis.""  The always appealing Claudia Black appeared as Cassandra and at the end of the episode the final shot of the season shows Hercules with his arm around her from behind, suggesting definite romantic potential.  Unfortunately, despite Cassandra's suggestion that they were going to be seeing a lot of one another and Hercules' agreement, Black would appear in only one more episode.

All in all, a reasonably pleasant show, but certainly not one of the milestones of television.",1189728000,3,2936,5.0644490644490645

1690289,5,B000063J8W,I thought the price was great for the number of dvds included. I am a fan so it would have been hard not to like it. Good extras included on the disks; pics and interviews. I will probably buy them all,1173398400,,201,3.926829268292683
1690290,5,B000063J8W,"I agree with Matthew Edmundson (below), this is the best season of Hercules The Legendary Journeys.

The first episode is my favorite episode of the whole series:

Mercenary, which was directed by Michael Hurst (Iolaus).

I recommend purchasing seasons 1+2 before purchasing this season.  Hercules involves a lot of recurring characters and stories that you may miss out on if you are considering buying this season first...

Some may say that this series was too corny (from other reviews I've read). But that was the point of the show. The action and the comedy were matched well together.",1168387200,,591,4.989795918367347

1690293,5,B000063J8W,"I love this show. Finally after almost a two month wait it's here. Hercules Season 3 was a great year for the show. Some of the most popular episodes they made were on it.
Kevin Sorbo aka Hercules favortie episode is included in this season. ""Mercenary"" is that episode. It's a great episoe where Hercules and a mercenary must defend themselves from Tremor like Worms and a bunch of pirates. It's a great episode and I can see why it's Kevins favorite.
There are two episodes with the goddess of love Aprhodite. ""Love Takes a Holiday"" and ""Reign of Terror"" both have her in it played by the lovely Alexandra Tydings. She is so hot in all her episodes. All her episodes are real good and are full of laughs. Sam Rami(Ex Pro) always made sure all the episodes with Aphrodite were great.
""Love Takes a Holiday"" is great in a way in that Kevin Sorbo isn't in it. Iolaus(Michael Hurst) stars as the lone hero in this one. He teams up with Aprhrodite to save a town from Aphestus the god of fire.
There are a ton of good episodes in this season. The christmas tribute one is here in ""A Star to Guide Them."" Hercules fights a mystic mummy in ""Mummy Dearest."" Hercules also gets sent back to 18 century France in ""Les Contemptibles."" He finds a new wife, battles his brother Ares and does much more in this legendary season.
Season 3 is awesome. It's better than 2 and I'd say equal to 1. The extras on this one are the best yet, and the DVDs just keep getting better. Fans of the show won't want to miss out on this one.",1081296000,9,1513,4.312280701754386
1690294,5,B000063J8W,"Hercules DVD Box sets get better and better with each season and Season 3 is no exception. The interviews are great and what I liked about the interviews Kevin did with Wayne Rose and Eric Gruendeman was that both Kevin, Wayne and Eric thanked the other actors who appeared in the show and they all clearly enjoyed watching the episodes again.  The interview with Kevin and Sam was great as they watched ""Prince Hercules"" and ""Judgement Day"", they are a great couple and helped each other out all through the interview.  I'm looking forward to seeing more interviews with both of them again in furture seasons.  Loved the bit where Sam asked Kevin where his wedding ring"" was, Kevin replied by saying ""I'm allergic to wedding rings"", which made me laugh.  Looking forward to Season 4 when it comes out on the 13th July.  So it's five stars all the way for Hercules Season 3, a must for any Hercules fan and for any DVD library",1081296000,3,926,4.554216867469879

The HERCULES: THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS SEASON THREE DVD release is highlighted by an impressive list of exciting bonus materials including:
 Audio and Video Commentary from Kevin Sorbo and Michael Hurst
 Behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast and series creators

1690297,5,B000063J8W,"The first and second seasons of HERCULES: THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS on DVD has been nominated for a prestigious Saturn Award from The Academy of Science Fiction Fantasy & Horror Films. The nomination is *much* deserved and one would think Season Three would not be able to come up to the awesome standards set by its impressive forerunners.
However ....
If anything, Season Three's DVD packaging is even BETTER than Seasons One and Two of this impressive adventure/fantasy TV series! Not only do we get all  22 episodes on DVD, including the stellar ""Mercenary"", ""Long Live the King"", ""The Hind Trilogy"", ""Surprise"" and the comic ""Les Contemptible"" -- but we are also treated with interviews and audio commentaries by star Kevin Sorbo and his stunning wife, actress Sam Jenkins Sorbo (who met Kevin during ""Prince Hercules""), Michael Hurst (Iolaus), Rob Tapert (executive producer) , Eric Gruendemann (co-executive producer) and Wayne Rose (First Assistant Director). Everyone has something to contribute, including personal recollections of the episodes, friends, stunt men, locations and guest actors. It sincerely adds to a watcher's viewing pleasure.
The quality of each DVD is remarkable; with stunning clarity and audio. The series, filmed in New Zealand, takes full advantage of the glorious scenery which we are treated to in each and every episode. The set pieces, some that are familiar and others which are new, continue to be a spectacular part of HERCULES. As are the wonderful array of guest actors, including the ever talented Rene Naufahu (""The Lady And the Dragon""/TALES OF THE SOUTH SEAS), Claudia Black (""Atlantis""/FARSCAPE), Jeremy Roberts (The Mercenary/THE MEXICAN) , Lindsey (L.L.) Ginter (""Rock and a Hard Place""/PEARL HARBOR, S.W.A.T.) and - last but not least - the late-great  Kevin Smith who played Ares, God of War, in both HERCULES - in this season for the first time - and XENA, WARRIOR PRINCESS. It was especially touching, while Kevin Sorbo and Wayne Rose were doing their audio commentary for ""Encounter"", that they acknowledged Kevin Smith and how much he is missed.
By the way, we also get to see some other familiar faces, including Alexandra Tydings (Aphrodite), the ever popular Bruce Campbell (Autolycus), Lucy Lawless (Xena) and Renee O'Connor (Gabrielle) again!
Included in the set I purchased was an extra special CD-Rom disc with chronicles, trivia, bios and mythology. GREAT fun for all! A nifty photo gallery and a web link, where you are connected to the official HERCULES website through your computer, is also included.
With all of this in the third season DVDs of HERCULES: THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS one truly does look forward to what is in store for us in the Season Four release!",1080345600,3,2726,5.1512415349887135
