8361095,4,B002BEXG5E,"Whoever made this film has been there.  This is definitely not your after school special about steroids.  In fact, steroids are just an insinuation that hangs in background as we follow the main character through his plight.  This film is more about what it means to be an athlete, the human side that never gets projected to the public, and moreover, what an athlete is like before they go pro, as well as the thousands that never make it, and what they sacrifice just in the attempt.  One could argue that the relationship aspect is great, which I did enjoy, but I personally found the struggle of the main character to strike a chord.

If you are a man, you need to see this.  If you are a woman , you should watch this film with your man.",1254268800,5,742,4.340579710144928
