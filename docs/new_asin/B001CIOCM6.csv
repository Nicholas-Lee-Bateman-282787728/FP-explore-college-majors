8287931,3,B001CIOCM6,"For those of you who are Tila Tequila fans--and there must be, what, 10 or 15 of you across the country--you'll get a pleasant surprise with this one, because the little MySpace tramp is shown here prior to her 15 minutes of fame, bearing everything and I mean everything.

Sadly, she's on of the better-looking women on the DVD. Overall this was a great disappointment and probably more like a 2.5-star presentation than a three-star one.

Far too many skinny chicks with $3,000 implant jobs. A total of about a dozen models in all. One really cute brunette. One awesome older blonde. Then you have Tila Tequila and nobody else even worth mentioning.

Lots of boring and horribly-shot home video. This series has spiraled downward since the first program, which at least had better-looking models.",1269475200,4,798,4.896296296296296
