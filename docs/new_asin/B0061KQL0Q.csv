8490867,1,B0061KQL0Q,"This sounded like a good idea - but the material is limited (to shows sold by the company that made this ""sampler"") There is so much more to Scandinavian Crime and they left out most of the interesting authors and projects - the interviews are amateurish and boring - the graphics repetitive and inappropriate and the whole tone is dreck.",1365724800,5,338,4.65
8490868,4,B0061KQL0Q,"I'm a great fan of Scandinavian crime and mystery fiction.  Love all the series that have been translated from written material to film/TV productions.  In this DVD we get an overview of several series that went from books to screen.  First up is about 30 minutes of Martin Beck with interviews of Maj Sjowall, the author, and Peter Haber who plays Beck.  Ms. Sjowall's heavy Swedish accent is hard to understand and there are no English subtitles.  Next is a review of the Wallander series with interviews from Henning Mankell.  Varg Veum's author tells how he created the ""lone wolf"" hero, and the Stieg Larsson Millennium series is discussed next.  The production company that creates these films have their producers and others who make the books come alive talk about the process.  There are just a few clips from each series since most of the DVD is an explanation of the process from books to films.  There are portions of interviews given by tour guides who explain scenery of filming places, especially Ystad in Sweden where the Wallander series is filmed.  A tour of the film stage is given as well.",1353283200,6,1109,4.7591623036649215
