4719828,4,B005LAIGSC,"The action/drama/mystery film opens with a quick character build up of the multifaceted CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). He operates a safe house with nobody in it. He wants a European field assignment, but lacks department seniority.

The movie switches to Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) obtaining an embarrassing electronic file from the MI6 in South Africa. ""Frost"", because he is cold. Denzel uses his expected savvy to escape. He is a rogue super agent who free lances, buying and selling information. In order to escape the bad guys, Tobin surrenders to the CIA. Now the questions are: Was this his original plan? What is on the file?

Tobin is taken to our aforesaid safe house for intense interrogation.

I loved the opening of the interrogation scene. The interrogator says, ""I'm here to advise you of your rights. You're being held under national security order 600 which means you have none.""

Frost is too important of a person and the top secret safe house comes under attack. The young low level highly trained Matt Weston is now on the run with a man who is a master manipulator of people. To our list of unanswered questions we now add, ""Who is the mole?""

Ryan and Washington give us excellent performances. It had elements of the Bourne series that made this story interesting, but it doesn't quite measure up to that film. Cliche ending. I would say if you are a fan of the trilogy, check this one out.

Multiple chase scenes, torture, killings, shoot outs, minor ""roof top"" jumping, car wreaks without explosions.

So, the baddies show up at the Safe House and shoot it up, so Ryan  and Denzel are on the run, they vear into oncoming traffic to elude them. They go to a sporting even to hide, suprising Denzel would even go along with this, even if Ryan holds a gun on him, we see he is capable of disarming people.  He cries out so the police jump in.

Meanwhile, the people at HQ (CIA in VA) FLY to South Africa, they figure someone on the inside is a nark (NO! REALLY! YES!) They aspire to go to another safe house after Ryan tracks Denzel down at one of Denzel's former known associates. At the new safe house fighting insues, we see an agent shoot a female agent point blank and she goes down, ugg.

Of course, one of the main handlers is a bad guy, no duh.  In the end Ryan submits his report, leaving out certain important parts that his boss questions, Ryan plays dumb.

His life is boring and routine until they bring in Tobin Frost (Washington) to interrogate. When the house is broken into and people start to die it is up to Weston to keep Frost alive and move him to a safe location. This is a movie I went to see with high expectations. The first 10-15 minutes is a little slow but when it picks up it really picks up. The rest of the movie you are on the edge of your seat. I love movies that keep you guessing and this is that kind of movie, you know there is a traitor and there are three obvious choices but you are still left wondering who it is. That to me adds to the enjoyment of the watching. I do have to say that my expectations may have been a little high and I didn't like it as much as I though I would, but this is still a must see movie. Overall, a very tense and exciting thriller that won't disappoint. I give it a B+.",1329350400,,1043,4.067961165048544
4719831,4,B005LAIGSC,"2012's ""Safe House"" pairs veteran star Denzel Washington and up-and-comer Ryan Reynolds in a spy thriller set in South Africa.  It offers lots of action, mayhem, and betrayal, served up with action sequences shot in grainy, jumpy footage moving at breathtaking speed.

Matt Weston (Reynolds) is a bored young CIA officer, minding a safehouse in Capetown, romancing a local girl, and begging his boss for more action.  Action arrives unexpectedly at the safe house in the form of a CIA team transporting renegade CIA agent Tobin Frost (Washington).  More action arrives unannounced in the form of a well-armed mercenary team seeking Frost.  Weston goes on the run with Frost in tenuous custody.

The narrative heart of the movie is the slowly developing relationship between the inexperienced Weston and master manipulator Frost.  As it becomes obvious there is another traitor in the mix, Weston and Frost will be forced to trust one another.  The action culminates in a desparate fight at a remote South African farmhouse.  There is a double ending.

""Safe House"" has an interesting plot (despite a surprising flat ending), a very solid cast including the supporting actors, and a good delivery.  Recommended as good entertainment.",1329091200,,1232,5.2030456852791875
4719832,3,B005LAIGSC,"""Safe House"" is an action thriller film. The narrative brings together Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who is a rookie CIA operative, and Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) a former CIA Agent who is accused of being a traitor.

Weston's deployment to South Africa has been uneventful for a year until Frost turns himself in to the U.S. embassy, following a narrow escape whilst collecting top secret information. What starts as an interrogation at the safe house becomes a shootout as an unidentified group attempt to capture Frost.

The story leaves the viewer for the most part trying to work out who are the good guys and the bad guys. Frost is presented as an enigma in terms of his actual allegiances, whilst young Weston is trying to make the right decisions amongst all the chaos.

This film is pure action genre with lots of shooting, explosions, and high speed car chases, yet it is part of a growing trend of works that are critical of intelligence agencies such as the movie ""Rendition"".

Reynolds and Washington both provide a vigorous and captivating screen presence in a story that isn't all that surprising, but is still quite entertaining.

4719833,5,B005LAIGSC,"""Safe House"" is great! This is how the story goes: For the past year, Matt Weston has been frustrated by his inactive, backwater post in Cape Town. A ""housekeeper"" who aspires to be a full-fledged agent, the loyal company man has been waiting for an opportunity to prove himself. When the first and only occupant he's had proves to be the most dangerous man he's ever met, Weston readies for duty. Tobin Frost has eluded capture for almost a decade. One of the best ops men that the CIA's known, the ex-intelligence officer has given up assets and sold military intel to anyone with cash since he turned. From trading secrets to North Korea to aiding splinter cells, the damage he's done to the U.S. is immeasurable. And he's now back on the reservation with a secret. As soon as Frost is brought in for debriefing, mercenaries come and tear apart Weston's safe house. Barely escaping, the unlikely partners must discover if their attackers have been sent by terrorists or someone on the inside who will kill anyone standing in the way. Now it's up to Weston to figure out who he can trust before they're both eliminated from the game.

The cast led by Denzel Washington (who also executive produced) (as Tobin Frost) & Ryan Reynolds (as Matt Weston) is great. The directing by Daniel Espinosa is great. The story & screenplay by David Guggenheim is great.

The music by Ramin Djawadi is great. The cinematography by Oliver Wood is great. The film editing by Richard Pearson is great. The casting by Sarah Finn is great. The production design by Brigitte Broch is great. The art direction by Jonathan Hely-Hutchinson, Shira Hockman, Pablo Maestre Galli & Erik Polczwartek is great. The set decoration by Melinda Launspach, Andrew McCarthy & Tom Olive is great. The costume design by Susan Matheson is great.

This is a great action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat with your heart racing and your mind thinking at the same time. Denzel Washington is great as usual in another memorable performance. This is another great film on Denzel's resume.",1329004800,6,2061,4.76750700280112
4719834,3,B005LAIGSC,"Denzel Washington once again stars as the wise, aging professional tutoring a young up-and-comer. This time it's Ryan Reynolds trying to atone for his green-suited comic book hero. The good news is that they both succeed in their roles for the most part. There isn't much new here. We have Tobin Frost (Washington) who is a rogue intelligence agent that is hunted by some bad guys and of course the CIA. As a way of escaping the bad guys he walks into the American consulate in Cape Town, South Africa. After a little water boarding he is taken to a ""safe house"" which is managed by Matt Weston who is bored out of his mind and looking for a little action. Well, he gets it with both barrels.

The wrinkle in this espionage thriller is that someone within the CIA is on the take and is alerting the bad guys as to Tobin's whereabouts. Pretty quickly we know it is likely one of two people. Go ahead and flip a coin. You'll have a 50/50 chance of guessing correctly. Why does everyone want Tobin's head? Well, he has a little microchip which contains the names of intelligence operatives who are selling information to the aforementioned bad guys. Matt and Tobin become unlikely allies in their attempt to stay alive. We get plenty of well done car chases, gun fights, close quarter fisticuffs and ghetto roof-top chases that we expect. And they are all tension filled. Some of the quick-cut editing was a bit disconcerting at times but I think that was just Swedish director Daniel Espinosa's style.

The cast is supplemented by Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga and Sam Shepard as CIA higher-ups. While obviously I think the film has its share of flaws and been-there-done-that action, I have to say I got caught up in it and certainly was never bored. If you've had your fill of espionage thrillers, skip it as there's not much new. But if you need a little adrenaline rush, go for it. ""Safe House"" will keep your attention.",1328918400,4,1922,4.600583090379009
4719835,3,B005LAIGSC,"Safe House has Denzel Washington return to the role everyone loves him for; that untouchable, bad ass, man of the hour kind of role that he's essentially played the majority of his career. Meanwhile, Ryan Reynolds sets out to try to prove he's capable of being more than a raunchy goofball. CIA agent Matt Weston (Reynolds) has anxiously been waiting to prove himself. He's been babysitting an empty safe house for twelve months and is eager to get out in the field. Matt gets his chance when Tobin Frost (Washington), ex-CIA agent, traitor to the organization, and currently one of the CIA's most wanted fugitives, is escorted there. But things are turned upside down when a group of unknown soldiers attack the safe house and take out the entire team who accompanied Frost. Now in over his head, Matt tries to cope with handling the situation on his own while Frost does his best to manipulate the rookie.

You'll probably notice the visual style of Safe House right away. It makes full use of that raw, gritty style. It's especially grainy at times as fluorescent lighting seems to jump off the screen. Judging by how the movie looks alone, you'd think Tony Scott directed it. But it's actually the English language debut of Swedish director Daniel Espinosa. So it just seems as though he patterned Safe House after Tony Scott's films. It doesn't take long for negotiations to get tense. Those moments in between the mayhem are when Safe House is at its best. It's like a game of tug of war between Frost's way of manipulating and Matt's attempt to stick to protocol while also juggling a relationship. Those moments of panic are explosive; especially the one at the safe house Matt was in charge of and the intense car chase immediately afterwards. Safe House has a way of getting really LOUD when you're totally expecting it. It usually involves a gunshot or six, but it's kind of the movie's way of telling you that some heavy stuff is about to go down.

The majority of the movie is basically Matt trying to prove himself as an agent all while absolutely everything that you could imagine to go wrong does. Safe House is actually pretty damn good for nearly half of the movie. Sure, Denzel is playing a character you've seen him play a few dozen times before but he does it so well and the audience obviously eats it up. So why wouldn't you give the paying viewer what they want to see? Ryan Reynolds makes the most of his performance though. He seems to be the most emotionally invested actor of the film meaning he shows the most emotion and has the most range. The movie kind of gets coiled up in itself with everything it has going for it in the last twenty minutes or so. It's like it couldn't handle the pressure of being a fairly strong action thriller or something. It becomes extremely excessive and it throws a ton of twists at you in this small amount of time. It's difficult to care about any of them when all of the characters feel so similar and you can pretty much see them coming a mile away. The movie follows this certain path that you may be expecting, but then it shifts direction before shifting again and shifting back again. Did you ever see the movie Basic with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson? Safe House was reminiscent of the amount of twists in Basic.

Safe House begins as this white knuckled thriller with a fairly strong screenplay from first time screenwriter David Guggenheim. The action is heavy, the story reels you in, and the performances of both Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds are pretty superb. Everything eventually falls apart though as Safe House falls victim to stereotypical mediocrity. Brutal and intriguing at times and completely frustrating at others, Safe House is mostly exactly what you're expecting and the type of action thriller you've seen done several times before.  It's basically a safe bet for success.",1328745600,27,3877,4.688693098384729

But the scenes of RRs character pounding on one of his wounded (shot twice) assailants mercilessly to extract the truth by brute force, and the scene where DW is waterboarded, and this is depicted as business as usual for the CIA, left me cold to this movie. Yes, its a story about corruption, and about why one of the characters went rogue. But RRs character is supposed to be innocent. His character arc is supposed to travel from innocence to awareness to taking action against corruption. BUT, he only winces when he realizes waterboarding is about to take place. And his pounding on a wounded guy he thinks is a bad guy is a klinker in his characterization. The cruelty involved is massive. Beyond that, when RR takes action in the final scenes, none of his actions address the use of torture as business as usual. Thanks, Hollywood, DW, and RR for normalizing unethical behavior (that has been proven to be useless) to fill seats in a movie theater. Blech.",1523750400,,1175,4.703883495145631

4720535,5,B005LAIGSC,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. I had seen it years ago; and while I generally dislike seeing a film a second time, I liked it again. The acting was very good, both by Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. The plot, while focusing on moles within the CIA, which was done already many times, was done differently. The film held my interest from beginning to end.
It is about a young inexperienced CIA agent who was given a job to mind a safe house, which was visited rarely. He has been in the CIA for only 12 months. He cannot tell his girlfriend what he really does and needs to lie to her.
Denzel Washington, in contrast, is a very experienced CIA operative, who went rogue. Both the CIA and thugs are after him. He gets information, which is not explained to us until the films end, that both the CIA and the thugs want. When the latter kill the man who gave him the information and shoot at him and pursue him, Washington runs to the US embassy, which then attempts to get the information from him.
Much action, shootings, deaths, car chases, escapes, and lies follow with Ryan Reynolds trying to find and capture Washington.
There is an ending with surprises.",1480464000,,1159,4.446009389671362

4720744,5,B005LAIGSC,"OH, THIS IS A GOOD ONE...

Washington, and Ryan make a super duo. Washington plays the part of a rogue deep cover operator. Ryan is a newbie. He's left to man this particular safe house. One of the many, many Safe Houses that are scattered everywhere across the world. Ryan's character is young, enthusiastic, at the VERY peak of health, constantly training, espionage, and everything else that it takes to be...dangerous, to become one of the best. Unfortunately, He doesn't even exist. His girlfriend thinks he just has a ""Government job."" He hasn't told her any different. But subterfuge, even by omission is still bull$#!+ ...So, day after day, after week, after months of sitting in a completely empty apartment. He's a glorified babysitter.
***Washington's character, as I said, is a deep cover operator. REALLY deep. As a matter of fact, he's walking around with enough info to wipe out a whole viper den of corruption from the top to the bottom of just about every nation...including our own...
  Creepy, right? Well, Washington's character is on the run. Some very dangerous people are willing to do anything AND everything, to kill him before he spills the info; he's finally captured (on purpose) and taken to, one of our Super Max hide and disappear programs. When they spill through the door, Ryan's  world is about to change...forever. it's an assignment alright. They need to hide this super-operator. Recover the data, and prepare him for immediate extraction. Ryan's character is frustrated. He wants an op. He's wasting his talents (of which not even his superiors know how truly competent he is!
  Okay. I'm stopping there. But rest assured Washington's character has been doing this for years. He is so dangerous..so great are his skills, so ruthless that it is really scary. Within moments, the safe house is breached, everyone is butchered, so Ryan takes a chance, and decides to takes his ""prisoner"" in. Ryan's character doesn't have a chance. Within just a little while, Ryan is awed and ashamed of how fast he loses the much more experienced operator. But there's one thing that every single hit squad, every attempted procurement, and dozens of operators trying their best to recapture washington, they have overlooked one detail..They all have forgotten about The Newbie. Having absolutely no other choice, the two hunted operators has to trust each other to escape. Little by little, Washington begins to be impressed. Ryan is NO ONE TO FOOL WITH. Both of them are lethal. Washington's character is ruined. He trusts no one. He has never had anyone that could protect his six. Ryan is unwavering in his altruism and honor. His unwillingness to kill, his steadfast belief in his country... surprises Washington...washington had been the best. But there is something to this newbie...This was a great movie. The finale scenes are so powerful that it actually choked me up. Now that's some acting!!",1469404800,7,2923,5.016494845360825

4721574,4,B005LAIGSC,"Safe House, 2012 film

It starts with a man hitting a punching bag, then talking to a woman. Then he reports to work. Matt wants another assignment. People walk on a crowded sidewalk. A man talks to another man about a deal. Later another man follows him into a small room. There is conflict! Outside a sniper shoots a man on the sidewalk! Wrong man? Tobin gets in a car and drives away, there is another shooting. Crowds in the street demonstrate for jobs. Tobin is followed by two men. A pistol shot sends a crowd running! Four men run after him but he gets away to an American consulate in Capetown. The CIA tells about Tobin Frosts history. Matt gets a telephone call. A team will extract Tobin and take him to a safe house. They ask him questions. Is this legal? They show the torture known as waterboarding.

Then an alarm goes off! Twelve heavily armed men are in the building! Doors are blown off, grenades thrown in 1 Machine guns fire, men fall. The attack succeeds. Where is he? Get in the trunk now! [This hides him.] Now there is a car chase. Matt is told where to go - can he make it? They drive on the highway, shots are fired. Tobin breaks free, he attacks Matt, the car stops. Matt acquires another car. How did the attackers know where to go? Was there a leak? Matt calls his girl friend and tells her to leave. His employer gives him orders, where to go. Matt collects a bag from a locker outside a stadium. Tobin creates a scene, the police arrest Matt and Tobin. Something happened at the Infirmary! Matt gets out, there are shots in the street and people run in a panic! Tobin also gets away. The meet at a subway station. Matt reports the news again.

Tobin has a hidden item. He uses hair clippers to change his appearance. [Clothes?] Matt meets his girl friend and tells her the facts about his job. Matt uses the Internet to view photographs (but this is noticed). Tobin meets a friend at his home. They view a screen. Tobin asks for a new passport. There is another attack at this house! Tobin escapes to the roof. The attackers follow. There is more shooting. Matt rescues Tobin again. They are pursued. There is more fighting and shooting. Who do they work for? Tobin talks about his past.

The next morning they drive to another safe house. The housekeeper calls in. We see an act of treachery! There is more conflict at this safe house! [This is like a nightmare.] Tobin tells about a laundry list. Outside a car drives on a road. An official talks to Matt. Then there is more shooting! A hell of a job. But there is a sad ending. Only one man walks away. Matt reports to headquarters in Langley. The report will have to be rewritten. What about Frosts file? That has dangerous information. CNN reports about a leaked file that exposed intelligence agencies corruption. What will Matt do next?

This movie has a high amount of action and shooting. The plot is basically about retrieving an item that has great value. Think of The Maltese Falcon. The story is thin, the action makes it interesting. It mostly takes place in Capetown South Africa. Do parts of the story seem implausible?",1434326400,,3116,4.469244288224956

4721680,5,B005LAIGSC,"I have rented a few movies from Amazon the past month and this has to be one my favorites.
I do love films where Denzil Washington is very cool and this was no exception.
Ryan Reynolds also played his role very well as a wannabe secret agent who wants to prove he is up for it and gets a lot more than he bargains for!
I won't say too much more as will spoil film but 5 star recommendation!",1427328000,,390,3.949367088607595

4721811,3,B005LAIGSC,"With top actors who are also two of my favourites, Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds in it I really was looking forward to this one. Neither does a bad job or anything it's just that the script and well movie plot overall was nothing new and dragged in parts. I actually fell asleep the first time I watched this, rewatching it the second time I didn't find I missed much more than I imagined had happened. It's watchable but the type of movie you need to be wide awake to watch and not something to watch after a hard day at work to unwind otherwise the pace will just put you to sleep, the opposite of what an action film usually does.",1423872000,,639,4.245901639344262

4721894,4,B005LAIGSC,"We rented this about a month ago, having missed it in the theatre. It was a good movie, at least to watch once. There are elements of the Bourne movies, but other movies have copied Bourne also. None have done better than Bourne. I like (but don't love) the acting of Denzel Washington, as I feel he overacts sometimes. He was pretty good in this. A few plot twists and turns, toward the end, the plot becomes a little fuzzy. Might not be the best movie you ever watched, but certainly isn't a waste of time.",1421884800,,508,4.302083333333333

I do think all the fight scenes were too long and detracted from the overall effect. However, I did watch it all the way through and was entertained. It was not a waste of time.",1421452800,,337,4.044776119402985

4721901,3,B005LAIGSC,"Does Denzel Washington ever turn in a bad performance?  Ryan Reynolds was solid in his role.  Intriguing premise, filled with action once the action gets going.  Looks like it was shot on location or someplace that didn't look like greater L.A. trying to emulate South Africa.",1421280000,,276,4.956521739130435
4721942,5,B005LAIGSC,"We do enjoy a good conspiracy thriller and this is one of the best; heaps of tension with lashings of action & conspiracy stuff. Denzel Washington brings his full charismatic force to bear playing the enigmatic Tobin Frost, Ryan Reynolds' committed portrayal of the rookie safe-house keeper is spot-on and the supporting cast are similarly superb. The taut, suitably opaque plot and the almost frantic pace combined with some magnificent South African locations is the perfect recipe for a hugely satisfying and entertaining movie. Cracking stuff.",1421280000,,547,5.372093023255814

4722977,3,B005LAIGSC,"Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors, and anyone who follows him knows that he is pure intensity. For that reason, he is usually best paired with someone who is charismatic, but in this film, he's paired with Ryan Reynolds, another intense actor, leading to a very straightforward and inflexible film. Safe House is your typical C.I.A. inspired action film, that features a wanted traitor turning himself in, in order to escape the men he's doubled crossed. The names and places are different, but the story is the same, lots of fighting and corruption, traitors and double agents, it's nothing new. The intensity in Safe House is just off the charts, as there isn't one second of comic relief. The movie starts intense and just continues that way until the end, which really does an injustice to the always strong performance of Washington. The fact of the matter is that this film could have been an interesting one, had Washington and Reynolds had any chemistry whatsoever, but they were basically the same person, on opposite sides of the table. Chemistry in a film like this is really everything, even in a film like Unstoppable, another straight forward and highly predictable film, it was entertaining because of the chemistry between Washington and Chris Pine. All in all, Safe House is an average film, without much of a supporting cast. It's two hours of chases and gun battles, over the same stuff that all these other films are based on. It's a textbook example of an action movie, with nothing else. It is forgettable and isn't unique in anyway, just the same thing you've seen a million times before.",1397952000,3,1624,4.845323741007194

This one is definitely a hit though. It is smart, well-paced, and well-acted by both leads. The pairing of Reynolds and Washington just worked for me. I also liked the unconventional locale of the story. South Africa is a more unfamiliar place, which lent it an added air of menace and danger in this thriller.",1392940800,,465,4.482352941176471

4723296,4,B005LAIGSC,What an intense performance by Ryan Reynolds.  The cinematography made you feel like you were right there.  Denzel Washington usually delivers a top drawer performance and this was no exception.  Not sure if the story line was based on actual intelligence operations but it made me feel glad I was never a part of the intelligence community.  All in all I liked the movie and would recommend it to others.,1389139200,,405,4.742857142857143
4723297,4,B005LAIGSC,"There is no shortage of action in this movie which begins 3 minutes after the opening credits and keeps going every time you think it is about to become dialogue-driven.  It stops short of being a perfect movie, but those are hard to come by.  The ending is a bit fast and kind of leaves you wanting more (either more specifics of how it all resolved or a little more time to bask in all the twists and turns being resolved to the degree that they were--or maybe both).  It would have been nice if maybe some of the ""good guy"" body count could have been turned to narrow escapes.  I got the impression that the dead characters were part of delivering an overall message.  I agree with the message, but don't really like it in movies since I am looking for entertainment, not messages.  It didn't hurt the movie a lot, but for me took it from 5 stars down to 4.",1389052800,,860,4.245398773006135

Either way this movie was a great movie if you like twisted spy type espionage story lines. Not to mention that the actor line up was right on target just like the Bourne movies. Action packed from the beginning this is a good movie with lessons to learn. Reminds me of our own situation of the Snowden issues.

4723396,3,B005LAIGSC,"The worlds most-wanted double, no, triple agent just turned himself in. An ambitious CIA safe house watcher is tasked with keeping him safe until relief arrives. Thats no easy mission when he cant trust anyone- not even himself.
Safe House: No one is Safe

A shepherd needs to bring in a sheep that may be a wolf instead.

Denzel Washington plays counter-intelligence-super-spy Tobin Frost who has been selling secrets to every side for years. Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern) stars opposite as the promotion-hungry CIA agent stuck in the dead-end job of watching over safe houses. In most movies, safe houses are places police and the FBI use to hide key witnesses that are unsafe anywhere else. In this arena, the safe house is an extraction point where individuals of interest are stored, interrogated and/or tortured if need be.

This is a familiar role for Washington who taps in to his Alonzo from Training Day style to create a character that appears wholly evil, but possible a misunderstood shepherd in sheeps clothing. Its a solid film that creates an paranoid atmosphere of whos out to get me and friend or foe at every turn. I give the movie extra credit for a nice turn thats not a twist. You know what to expect: worthy interactions between characters, a few tightly done and suspenseful action sequences and a small moral question of how intelligently the intelligence branch of our government operates. Worth renting, but I wouldnt add I to my collection at full price. Im no movie critic; Im just critiquing a movie.",1385683200,,1530,4.854406130268199

This movie starts out a little slow and then, bam, moves right into action that you ride along with, wondering what is going to happen next. Very exciting. Ryan Reynolds shows a different side of him that you normally don't see in other movies he has made. He did a fine job as well. Enjoyed it! I think that they made this movie just for me.

4723522,4,B005LAIGSC,"An up to date Cold War Thriller with Washington playing a CIA turncoat who starts the ball rolling by escaping a group of gunman by turning himself into an American Embassy. This occurs after the first spate of gunfire has opened the film. From the Embassy the gunfire is  picked  up in the CIA Safe House and nothing is settled for the remainder of the picture. As usual, Washington carries the heavy load of an Established Star; as usual, he does so with style and flair. It is a strong cast and, together with the Star, they put on a show which never flags. Will the CIA relatively newcomer to the Business, bring in Washington and return him to American custody? Will either or both of them live what with being surrounded (it often seems) by an army of gunmen out to get Washington at all costs? What about the host country, will there be an International Incident over the affair? The film carried me along with it, no flagging of interest, to the very end.

His attempt to escape, accompanied by a rookie CIA ""housekeeper"" who falls into his orbit, is accomplished via car-chases followed by foot races followed by shootouts followed by fistfights followed by variations on all the above.

I don't normally watch violent movies. I think there is just way too much of it that isn't necessary to tell a good story. There was definitely a lot of it in Safe House, but when the story finally finishes up, you will see that it makes the story more meaningful. I LOVED the story. It isn't something you normally see. It's definitely NOT formulaic. Very interesting twist. The setting was fabulous. It's rare that movies are set in South Africa unless they are about apartheid or something like that. This wasn't anything like that, but the cultural piece made this far more interesting than if it had been set in Amsterdam or New York. The actors were believable.

It's not a pretty movie, and the 'good guy'; and 'bad guy' lines are at times blurred.  Yet, it's gritty presentation seems probably more real than we'd like to admit.  All in all, it kept me guessing a few times and provided thought-provoking entertainment.",1356912000,,369,4.825396825396825

4724110,5,B005LAIGSC,I have been wanting to see this ever since it came out.  I love Denzel Washington.  He is one of a kind actor.  Great job Denzel as always.  I am very pleased with the Safe House.,1356480000,,179,3.888888888888889
4724111,5,B005LAIGSC,This isi one great movie.  Denzel certainly delivers.  The action scenes are wonderful and the movie never gets boring. This is a must see!,1356393600,,139,4.75
4724112,1,B005LAIGSC,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...

Safe House (2012) is just a typical action movie of the present day.  Very predictable.  Before watching this movie, I asked my nephew what it was about.  After he told me, I said, ""Now let me guess...there's going to be gunfire galore, fistfights, high speed chases down streets and freeways, lots of reckless driving, car crashes, and a passenger in the car is going to try to take over the wheel and has to fight the driver in order to get control of the car.""  The movie started.  Everything I predicted came true.  This is just a predictable action movie of today.  If you've seen one, you've seen them all.  This movie has a thin plot as well.  It doesn't matter who's playing the lead role, Denzel Washington or the man on the moon.  It doesn't matter.  It's just mindless action and violence that we've all seen thousands of times before.  Now, I like action movies, but so many of them are all the same.  The only ones I watch are the very best ones.  I always ask myself how much of this stuff do I really need to watch because it's all the same, just a different movie title and different actors.  Another thing about this movie is that the camerawork is horrendous.  It reminds me of camcorder movies like The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, etc.  The camera always moves left and right, up and down, zigzagging, etc. even while the subject being filmed is sitting stationary, such as a person sitting in a chair.  Horrible.  A lot of the action/fight scenes remind me of some of the fight scenes in The Dark Knight (2008).  Poor editing.  Poor camerawork.  You can barely see what's happening on the screen.  Not that it matters in Safe House.  The Dark Knight as a movie, however, was cool.

My recommendation:  If you like mindless run-of-the-mill action movies, this might be your cup of tea.  If you don't want to see a run-of-the-mill action movie, then steer clear of this dreck.",1356307200,4,2003,4.5790960451977405
4724183,2,B005LAIGSC,"I got this for a weekend away with friends, and the guys liked it, but it seemed a bit grim and chaotic for me.  I think Denzel was a bit too down right serious throughout, and the show just didn't grab me.  I've seen him in better films.  Fine for a space filler, though, on a long weekend with nothing to do.",1356307200,,310,3.967741935483871
4724184,3,B005LAIGSC,"There's not a thing wrong with this movie.  But it it's the same movie you've seen 50 times.  The same character actors play the CIA guys.  They probably have it on their business cards by now.  (""FBI-CIA agents a specialty"").  There's the Tom Cruise/Russell Crowe/Matt Damon chase scene and the Bruce Willis/Arnold shootout scene, the knife made from broken glass, car chases and of course black SUVs in the desert.  All are done well but these things are so familiar, they seem pretty mundane.

Denzel is excellent and you get to see a little of Cape Town which, for all it's problems, is a beautiful spot (and not quite as violent as what's in the movie).  The ending is routine but judging by the 5 star reviews, a lot of people were surprised to find things were not what they seemed at the beginning.  Fair enough, I won't give away the shocking ending.

So...if you want action, this will do.  If you're interested in how a neophyte, caught in a dangerous situation rises to the occasion see Three Days of the Condor.",1355961600,2,1024,4.571428571428571
4724185,3,B005LAIGSC,Of course Denzel is always one step ahead of death and other mayhem. And the movie was very entertaining and had some interesting scenes.,1355875200,,137,4.75
4724186,3,B005LAIGSC,Another gift to a friend who is a WW II buff and who greatly enjoyed this DVD. She had asked for it.,1355875200,,100,3.590909090909091
4724187,4,B005LAIGSC,I like this movie. It kept me on my toes even though I knew who the bad guy was. Great escape.,1355788800,,94,3.5238095238095237
4724188,4,B005LAIGSC,"Film is well done having enough surprise twists to keep it interesting.  The ending was less than satisfying.  We all found ourselves rooting for Denzel, hoping that he was really a good guy and would be able to clear his name and survive.",1355702400,,239,4.534883720930233
4724189,4,B005LAIGSC,Denzel Washington gives another star-studded performance in this movie.  Parts of the movie kinda gives the ending away but overall it was a good movie,1355702400,,151,5.04
4724190,5,B005LAIGSC,"This movie starts a bit slow, but once I got past the first ten minutes, I was sucked in and completely absorbed. I loved the tension between the characters, and within the main character himself. Denzel Washington does a great job without stealing the show from Ryan Reynolds.",1355443200,,277,4.791666666666667
4724191,4,B005LAIGSC,"Instead of a dog fight in a small closed area that I expected from the title ""Safe House"", the movie gave me over an hour of high octane high quality gun fight and car chase scenes that reminded me of the Bourne Triology (I still hadnt seen the fourth one). Denzel was as smart and cool as usual. Ryan just gave a superb performance that you would wonder whether he's the same one you saw before. The plot was so so but the script was excellent. Highly entertaining which is great after a day's hard work. In short, recommended!",1355443200,,528,4.343434343434343
4724192,5,B005LAIGSC,This was a movie that I thought was going to be gritty.... I just wasn't aware of how gritty it was going to be. I enjoyed every suspenseful moment of this movie from beginning to end. WOW what a performance. Ryan was on point and complimented Denzel wonderfully.,1355356800,,263,4.5
4724223,3,B005LAIGSC,"Pretty run of the mill action movie.  Maybe I should lower my expectations of Denzel...also, Ryan Reynolds should return to comedy if you ask me.",1355356800,,145,4.8
4724224,5,B005LAIGSC,In my opinion this movies is full of action and suspense. It's certainly worth washing. Denzel Washington pulls it off again by playing his role well...,1355270400,2,152,4.884615384615385

4724228,4,B005LAIGSC,Very action packed and full of suspense.  I love Denzel and he really is a great hardworking actor.  He is so believable in his roles.  I could watch this again,1355097600,2,160,4.266666666666667
4724229,4,B005LAIGSC,"Yes, I really liked this movie and I am glad I got it.  I have nothing negative to say about it and this is saying alot.

4724230,5,B005LAIGSC,Denzel once again carries the story in this high action movie. Great acting by both actors but the great Denzel Washington is without a doubt a Mega Star! Great movie!,1354924800,2,167,4.6
4724231,4,B005LAIGSC,"This was a pretty decent movie. Denzel doesn't disappoint (rarely does), and the movie is action packed, with a good plot. Not a movie for kids.",1354838400,2,144,4.576923076923077

4724293,3,B005LAIGSC,The movie is great...No issues with playing discs. The only reason I purchased this particular Combo pack was because it included the Ultraviolet digital copy. The problem was that the Ultravoilet code was expired by the time I received the product (it expired a few months before I even ordered the movie). There was no indication of this in the product details so I had no way of knowing this before purchasing.,1354492800,2,413,4.75
4724294,5,B005LAIGSC,I liked this movie so much. It kept me on my seat with all the different things that was going on in the movie. I liked that I couldn't figure out who the rat was until he let it be known...,1354492800,,190,3.658536585365854
4724295,1,B005LAIGSC,"My review is not about the movie itself, rather the disc. My blu-ray player wasn't connected to the internet and we couldn't figure out why it would work. The menu showed up but it wouldn't play as it just looped back to the main menu. I restarted my blu-ray player with the network connection plugged in a voila, it was a totally different look. Thank you Universal for delivering ads (upcoming blu-ray releases) to the disc's home screen. I am thoroughly unpleased that I have to have a network connection just in order to watch the movie I purchased.",1354492800,,553,4.595959595959596
4724296,4,B005LAIGSC,Typical story fo ex-CIA agent with someone inside the organization trying to get him.  Denzel W. turns in superb performance.  Scene in drug store is very memorable.  Lots of shoot outs and stuff getting blown up:  my kind of flick.,1354320000,3,232,4.725
4724297,4,B005LAIGSC,"At the brick and mortar store this retails for around 18.99-24.99 still. I got this on cyber Monday and watched it on the Thursday when it came in. Movie was good, and it keeps you guessing until the end.",1354320000,,204,4.256410256410256
4724298,5,B005LAIGSC,"We will watch almost anything with Denzel Washington.  He is always believeable and interesting.  Ryan Reynolds did well, also.  They interaction was just right.  This movie has enough action without going overboard.  The story and the ending really held our interest!!!",1354233600,3,270,5.487804878048781
4724299,4,B005LAIGSC,"If you are anything like me, you've been waiting for a while for Ryan Reynolds to lose the funny pretty boy license and get into a role that required him to get dirty. That required him to be pushed decidedly out of his comfort zone. He is slowing starting to move in the direction of those who have come before him in the vein of Jamie Foxx whom a few years ago you couldn't have taken seriously. The action, the lack of gratuitous sex and  the menace are all very real - the ending is a bit too predictable and Ryan Reynolds hops back to safe territory by essentially being offered his dream job come the end of the movie and you can't tell me that the CIA would just let you burn them. I give Ryan A+ for effort, Denzel is of course always a pleasure to watch and this is a good show all around with less of typical action feel and more of a thriller one.",1354233600,10,858,4.076923076923077
4724300,5,B005LAIGSC,Ryan Reynolds does and excellent job in this roll.  Shows he knows more than just comedy.  This was an excellent suspense film and would recommend it to anyone who loves Ryan Reynolds.,1354147200,2,184,4.71875
4724301,4,B005LAIGSC,"Quality acting, directing, production, etc typical Denzel stuff.  It's great entertainment for a movie night in the crib.  grab some popcorn and enjoy.

4724403,3,B005LAIGSC,"SAFE HOUSE is a predictable by the book car chase, foot chase action thriller, ably directed and adequately performed.  Denzel Washington brings his usual charm in the role of a rogue CIA agent pursued by the eager young ""safe housekeeper"" earnestly played by Ryan Reynolds.  Of course, government corruption and cover-ups are involved.  The identity of the ultimate villain is fairly predictable.  Supporting the two leads are Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard, Ruben Blades and Robert Patrick.
At 115 minutes, SAFE HOUSE overstays its welcome but ultimately its an entertaining diversion.",1353888000,,599,5.478260869565218

4724463,4,B005LAIGSC,This movie is a good action flick but definately not one of Denzels best.  It was entertaining but the plot was just ok and time jumps a few times in the movie so you lose plot but get more action.  The twists if you call it that are easy to see coming.,1353542400,3,253,3.8461538461538463
4724464,5,B005LAIGSC,Lots of action with a good story.  Both Denzel and Ryan make a great combination.  Developed Ryan's character too fast from a first time in action character to a hard ass.,1353456000,,171,4.483870967741935
4724465,3,B005LAIGSC,IT WAS A DECENT FILM. DENZEL DID HIS THING AS ALWAYS. THE PLOT COULD OF BEEN BETTER DEVELOPED. . IT STREAMED PERFECTLY WITH NO PAUSES OR SKIPS. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE AMAZON TO WATCH MOVIES AS WELL AS SHOWS.,1353456000,,207,4.2

4724469,5,B005LAIGSC,"If, half-way through the movie, you were asked to name the director, you'd probably say ""Tony Scott"", so high is the level of violence, so non-stop is the force of the movie, which never relents with thrills and realistic hand to hand combat. Reynolds manages to keep pace with Washington and you would swear they were both doing their own stunts, so realistic are the fight scenes. The movie focuses on ""you do what you have to"" as the ends are used to justify the means. Internal corruption within the agency itself is dealt with that slant of deviousness usually reserved for foreign foes. A straight-ahead thriller which boasts an outstandingly professional cast, allowed to do their own things while obviously aware of and steadfastly following the Director's camera moves. Though by no means a ""chick flick"", women who appreciate the stark realism of the spy world, shoul be jolted by its violent spy-world atmosphere.

4724719,4,B005LAIGSC,"""Safe House"" comes on like a souped-up ""Bourne"" directed by Tony Scott - all frantic pace, sinister synths and choppy-choppy editing. Sure this has been done before - but what's makes this espionage movie so different is the sheer effort the cast, crew and writers put into depicting the 'thrill' in 'thriller'. You can literally feel them working their well-paid butts off to please you in every possible way. Add to this formidable stew of film-making excellence - a cleverly chosen cast of top class actors like Denzel Washington, Sam Sheppard, Robert Patrick, Vera Farmiga, Fares Fares, Ruben Blades and the superb Irish duo of Brendan Gleeson and Liam Cunningham - and you can almost forgive Ryan Reynolds trying to break free from rom-coms and getting all John McClane sweaty teeshirt on us...

As you can imagine the action comes at you fast and furious. The fight sequences were choreographed for months in advance (using the actors themselves) and escalate in their ingenuity and hands-on nature - while the car chases are pulse-pounding too. But its the great cast who give it a beating heart. With the exception of say Liam Neeson or Tommy Lee Jones - I couldn't see any other leading man bring so much to a cop/agent as Denzel Washington does. He is typically brilliant here. He plays Tobin Frost - the CIA's more-wanted whistleblower (off the grid for a decade) who suddenly waltzes into the American Embassy in South Africa's capital city of Cape Town. Years of interrogation techniques under his belt and a file in his leg that will fry many dodgy types on different continents - Tobin smiles, grimaces and generally messes with everyone's head. Digging in to find more nuances - Denzel is magnificent at this - and it goes a long way to keeping you watching as the begrudging relationship develops between his character (the old timer on the run) and Reynolds character Matt Weston (the rookie forcing into protecting him from all comers). And on it goes to a final show-and-tell gun battle in another compromised 'safe house' where the young buck Matt has been seriously underestimated by everyone - including the good guy/bad guy Tobin Frost (dialogue above)...

The BLU RAY picture isn't great it has to be said because Director Daniel Espinosa is going for gritty realism and not clean cut - but it does show off the superb and extensive use of Cape Town as a city and the South African countryside that surrounds it which has a certain beautiful light - and look. Placing it in this unusual location gives the street action (and shanty town sequences) a fresh feel too. And don't watch the extras 'before' the movie - they give away far too much plot.

A bit of a cracker frankly...

PS: Look out too for the unpronounceable NORA ARNEZEDER who plays the 23-year old French girlfriend Ana - I'm certain she's been genetically engineered by the CIA to be one of the most gorgeous women on Earth - and will therefore turn out to be the 'sleeper agent' in ""Safe House 2 - The Sequel - Even Safer Than The Last House"".

4724920,4,B005LAIGSC,"While a timely topic is explored within a fictional window that allows the adult viewer to escape from the current, real world tragedies, one has to, as always, understand that the perfection of ""Hollywood"" and certain bias will have to be filtered out in one's mind to thoroughly enjoy Denzel Washington's and Ryan Reynolds' portrayal of Tobin Frost and Matt Weston.  The intrigue, plot variables and cinematography are all top drawer and the sub-plots, with their twists and turns keep the viewer on point with fast paced action and perhaps, while not subtle, make the film entertaining from start to finish.

Well, its not often the viewer can correct defects in the theatrical release. But with the ff and stop-action buttons, those things that raced heedlessly across the screen now obey your will.  Another compaint was that the movie was by the numbers and held no surprises.  But I was surprised several times. One surprise was Ryan Reynolds.  He sank into this role with a gritty bearing far, far outside the comic domain.  Actors in these kind of roles sometimes seem to be on automatic, which can work, but with Reynolds you can always see the wheels turning--a subtle but significant difference.  Denzel was good too, of course, but it is Reynolds you will remember.  The ending, laced with reflective overtones, was especially well-done.",1347321600,,880,4.865771812080537

4725173,4,B005LAIGSC,"Powerhouse performances from the two leads Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, as well as the nice photography of South Africa, give ""Safe House"" an edge over other spy action thrillers. The story is too thin; action set-pieces are familiar; and supporting actors including Rub&eacute;n Blades, Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Robert Patrick and Sam Shepard are typecast and rather wasted. But the film's brisk pace and raw energy almost make up for the lack of a more coherent and convincing storyline.

Ryan Reynolds is a young CIA agent Matt Weston stationed in South Africa in charge of a ""safe house."" His assignment has been a monotonous and uneventful one until Denzel Washington's Tobin Frost, a former CIA operative gone rogue, is brought to him. When his safe house is under attack from a group of heavily armed men, Matt Weston has to learn quickly how to survive, while running away from the assassins with Tobin Frost.

Action sequences include a car chase in the street, shoot-outs and close combats. Because Washington's character is a master of interrogation, he gets into psychological warfare with the young agent, who, when they first meet each other, is obviously no match for Tobin. Also, ""Safe House"" in part looks like a road movie, where a younger and more inexperienced agent learns from the elder and seasoned one. And there is Matt's love interest Ana (Nora Arnezeder), who still does not know the real job of her boyfriend.

Thus ""Safe House"" tries to do many things within its 115 minute running time, but it is most effective when focusing the two leading actors. This is a slick action film featuring strong performances from talented leads, and the first-rate stunts undermined by busy camera work and hectic editing.",1347148800,,1749,5.0034364261168385
4725174,2,B005LAIGSC,"I found Safe House to be a cumbersome and predictable spy thriller.

The pacing is best described as bipolar, going from hectic action to glacial monotony like someone was flipping a coin to decide how a shot should be paced. I am sure someone thought the slower parts were supposed to build tension; except they don't. Mostly because the movie telegraphs all of it's moves like it's painting by numbers. It's not that the script is really, really bad, I just feel like it's trying to be way more sophisticated than it actually is. You get the distinct impression that they really want to surprise you, but the only way you could be surprised is if you slept through the middle of the movie, which is entirely plausible as there will certainly be times when you will get bored.

The acting isn't bad, but at no point is it amazing. Reynolds certainly delivers as the in over his head CIA drone, but sadly Denzel seems to be partially phoning it in. Denzel's character is supposed to be some kind genius rouge super spy, but at no point in the movie are you getting that OMG he IS Keyser Soze and Jason Bourne moment. I kept hoping everything happening in the movie was just in Matt's(reynolds) head because Frost(Denzel) has him on a Machiavellian mental lock down, but the script never really explores this. When they bring Frost in for interrogation, I was thinking he would start controlling everyone like Christopher Walken's performance in Suicide Kings.

According to this movie the very first thing they do in a clandestine CIA interrogation is water-board you, and maybe they do. Except in this movie the whole scene is so out of place you can't help but think they originally had a completely different scene written, but water-boarding was all over the cable news networks in 2011 so we gotta have a scene where someone gets water-boarded, because water-boarding. To highlight how baffling and out of place this one scene is, in the run up to the actual torture itself Frost is making cracks about the thread count of the towels ""you gotta have the 600s"" this is supposed to tells us that Frost is really running the show with Denzel's signature sly knowing grin as a wink to the audience. The sequence just felt plainly shoehorned into the script, where as I feel a scene with some ""acting"" and ""dialogue"" might have had a better impact on the overall story. The whole scene could have been filled with sinister tension instead of just a wet, disheveled and gasping Denzel and confused looking puppy dog Reynolds. Also Denzel's character Frost is like spy famous with people recognizing him on sight like he is some kind of celebrity that all the junior spies collect trading cards of when they go to spy school. In fact in a cut scene to Langley CIA HQ several ""analysts"" give a seamless rundown of how dangerous Frost is in an interrupting and finishing each others sentences kind of way, it left my head spinning with the improbabilities.

Another thing that bothered me was all the car accidents. On one hand, thank the gods of cinema that the director didn't blow up everything in sight, like some unbearable hacks(Michael Bay as an example) who think that anytime two cars collide one must flip over, blow up or turn into a robot. The problem is that both the protagonists and the antagonists are in so many violent collisions throughout the movie with not a seatbelt or airbag in sight. Sure they get some cuts and bruises but seriously a few of the collisions should have resulted in death(due to lack of treatment) if not a major concussion or broken limbs. Yet the plot keeps reaching for the car crash as a mechanism to change the arc of the action, instead it runs over your suspension of disbelief like a hit and run victim.

Also Reynold's character has nearly magic super powers of reasoning and observation that are downright preposterous. He uses his super powers only when the writer runs out of talent and has written himself into a box with no other way out. I can think of three examples in the movie that would probably impress Sherlock Holmes.

A question that keeps coming up in the film is why Frost is in South Africa, Matt keeps asking it like any answer Frost gives him might actually be true or relevant. Nearly every character in the film asks this same question, like it's some kind of talisman and that if they keep asking it, the whole story will eventually start making sense. The writer's hope is that the audience will think that there is something important in the question and divert the viewer's attention from the MacGuffin that clumsily holds the story together. The whole situation is very funny as the audience already knows the answer to the question and was blatantly shown the MacGuffin in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Oh and yes, the whole plot is held up by nothing bigger or better than a classic and trope laden ""Macguffin chip"", and for three fourths of the movie only the audience and one character actually know what it is.

There is also a kind of ""romance"" that is barely a subplot, that is literally all I can say about it. The romance was on the screen just enough for you to notice it, provide a touch of character background and motivation and really nothing else.

If your cool with watching Denzel Washington get repeatedly handcuffed to random objects and Ryan reynolds get beaten up over and over, then you are going to love this movie. Otherwise wait until you can watch it for free and save your $2.99 for a better film like Ronin or Spy Game if you want a taught espionage thriller.",1347148800,3,5564,4.630192502532928

All member of Israeli intelligence are evil.  Julian Assange and Bradley Manning are (really, really) good.  And this is all TRUE.  The actor Sam Shepard tells us so in the ""Making of"" bonus and he knows because he's a friend of Valerie Plame, the faux spy.  The action is totally implausible (as it is in most movies of this genre) but the plot (such as it is) is boring.  Denzel plays Denzel really well (he's got that down pat) and Ryan Reynolds plays himself (not a compliment).  A total waste of time.",1347148800,3,643,4.4655172413793105

4725299,4,B005LAIGSC,"CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) discretely guards a safe-house in South Africa that has less activity than a morgue.  His average shift at work involves tossing a ball against a wall roughly 8043 times, becoming a Sudoku master, some alone time on the porcelain throne, and more Angry Birds than you care to imagine.  Everything changes when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a rogue agent forced to either turn himself in to the US Consulate or die at the hands of criminals, enters the fold.  Frost's presence creates an opportunity for Weston to prove himself, but Frost may be too much to handle physically and/or psychologically.

Aside from the fact that the pair must go on the run and endure car chases during the shoot-outs and battles with enemies, the film felt like it could have easily been a sequel to Assault on Precinct 13 or The Contract.  (Oddly enough, each of those films has a younger white actor guarding/protecting an older black actor, and in each case the older actor is the superior in most conceivable ways.  I digress.)

Much like his relationship with Denzel in terms of acting, Ryan Reynolds is initially over his head.  Ultimately, however, a case could be made that he just about holds his own in this pulse-pounding, action thriller.  Nonetheless, both captivate.  Having said that, the action is the real star.  One particularly awesome shootout takes place in what must be the slums of Capetown, where bullets and bodies fly through corrugated roofs and paper-thin walls.  The film feels like it's about 45 minutes long because there really isn't a second to breathe.

Derivative but enjoyable.",1346889600,,1634,4.941391941391942
4725300,4,B005LAIGSC,"This movie keeps your on the edge of your seat most of the movie.  I was never bored and didn't notice the time fly by as I watched.  The intensity of both actors is very good and you end up rooting for the good (Ryan) and the bad (Denzel) guy.  Ryan Reynolds plays a safe-house manager who receives an extraction team holding Denzel Washington in custody.  Denzel plays a secret agent who went rouge years ago.  He is using the safe-house to try to get away from some thugs who are trying to kill him but of course they find him and then the run is on.  Ryan tries to keep Denzel in custody as the two fight off waves of thugs, all the while the government is trying to determine is Ryan has gone rouge too.

Why does Reynolds pull a gun on local police officers?  None of the actions of the major characters makes any sense, and the reveal doesn't help-- it just hopes that you didn't remember the first 20 minutes, I suppose, because it makes everything all the more illogical. Then, the big reveal just follows the now all too formulaic plot of most CIA oriented movies of the past decade or so.

The thriller started off with Matt bored out of his mind and looking for excitement. When he met Frost, he got more than what he bargained for. Frost takes Matt through ups and downs and makes him question his loyalty to the very country he serves.

My heart was definitely racing through the entire film, but the ending sent me over the edge. I don't know if I'd watch it again, but I did enjoy the experience.",1346284800,,541,4.520408163265306

4725598,4,B005LAIGSC,"The movie features good super spy turned bad Tobin Frost (Washington) who is hunted by the inexperienced safe house attendant Matt Weston (Reynolds). The plot follows these two along their path and the twists and turns are about as expected. Washington is one of the best actors in Hollywood and he saves this film from mediocrity. Reynolds, is well, Ryan Reynolds, not a great actor, but not terrible; he is believable as a dude who can kick ass but is not nearly as lethal as Tobin Frost. This is one that I'm glad I rented; it's worth watching once, but I don't think I'd want to keep it in my library. For the most part, you get what you'd expect; a lot of action, blood, fights, gun fire, chases, and some drama.

4725685,4,B005LAIGSC,"""Safe House"" starts out with a bang- it has more action in the first 30 minutes than most movies have in their entirety. And it's well-filmed, gritty, grounded, realistic action. You will be sucked in and reluctant to blink, as you follow the events that unfold in the film's first third. Whoever directed this movie clearly studied a lot of Tony Scott pictures while he was in film school- his influence is stamped all over ""Safe House"", which is by no means a bad thing.

Here we get a great glimpse of ""Bad Denzel"", the one who shows up in the likes of ""Training Day"" and ""Book of Eli"". He is incredibly confident, capable, and intimidating, without ever coming off as being unduly cocky or melodramatic. He is one of the great actors  working today, and his charisma is hard to ignore. Ryan Reynolds holds his own as he tackles the formidable task of trying to perform opposite Denzel. The young Reynolds does a great job here, and you don't even think of him as ""Van Wilder"" during the movie... not too much, anyway! And love the small role that Robert Patrick performs, as a grizzled, hard boiled combat vet.

Unfortunately, things start to slow down about halfway through the movie (though there are still a couple of great action sequences sprinkled throughout), and then the story goes completely off the rails. If you've seen just about ANY unambitious government/spy/action movie over the past 25 years, you will see the ""surprise"" ending coming ten miles away. It's such a tired cliche, I don't even think you could call it a ""surprise"" by any means. I guess I was just ""surprised"" that a movie with such high production values wouldn't spend a little more time on the development of the plot. Bummer- but even the uninspired story cannot undo what is an otherwise great, gritty action flick. Anybody who is a fan of Denzel, action, or ""Tony Scott"" style movies will not be disappointed.",1345507200,,1899,4.696696696696697

RR expanded his talents with a decent performance in ""Buried"" but in ""Safe House"" he took it to a new level and has finally arrived as a ""5 tool"" multi-talented star.  This performance combined with his RomCom and Drama skills should put RR on track to become the next Brad Pitt or Denzel.  Looking forward to seeing him in other good roles that display his new found acting depth.

After not seeing many trailers or previews for Safehouse, I had assumed it would be an action flick with great editing and camera angels, and some well choreographed gun fights; and I was right in that assumption.

I would say this movie fits comfortably between two of my favorites, The Bourne Supremacy and Collateral. This film includes excellent vehicle chases like in each of these, along with the realistic cinematography present in most Michael Mann films.

4726050,3,B005LAIGSC,"Either a major coincidence has occurred every time Denzel was cast for his last 20-something movies where each director successively said to him, ""Could you just play the same character you played in your last movie?"" or Denzel has just found a character comfort zone that he knows the audience will love every time. And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Safe House was all the way back in 1992's Malcolm X (he played Malcolm X).

But still...I was certainly entertained by Safe House. As the story goes, Ryan Reynolds is a green CIA agent house-sitting an empty CIA Safe House in South Africa. But the Safe House isn't empty for long; some agents show up with Denzel in tow as their prisoner, and the action begins when powerful forces show up to make sure that the Safe House is the last place that Denzel ever sees.

All in all, Safe House was a good movie. In a predictable, redundant Hollywood portrayal, the CIA brass are either crooked or idiots. And the movie seemed to run a bit long at almost a full 2 hours. But Safe House is definitely a thriller worthy of your rental queue...at minimum check it out when it comes out on cable or satellite.",1342742400,3,1235,4.508928571428571

4726141,3,B005LAIGSC,"STORY: Untested CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is the bored keeper of a South African safe house that is rarely used. Immediately after requesting a transfer, he receives an unexpected guest: Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a CIA agent that went rogue nearly a decade ago, voluntarily turns himself into the American consulate and is brought to Weston for safekeeping. Unfortunately, the safe house turns out to be not so safe, and Weston finds himself escorting Frost to the proper authorities on his own. Now, if only he could figure out who the proper authorities are.

Cue: car chases, gun fights, close quarters combat, and a few half-hearted red herrings.

I'm a huge fan of Reynolds. I enjoy him even when he's starring in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/unwatchable-dreck/dp/B004EPZ07K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">unwatchable dreck</a>. Denzel Washington, too, is a captivating actor. Both of them do an excellent job in this film, selling their characters' flaws and virtues without overdoing it. The rest of the cast is peppered with more well-tested talent -- Vera Farmiga (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000NGTJTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>), Brendan Gleeson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B000HKY9W8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>), Sam Shepard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Hawk-Down/dp/B000GX8B9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Hawk Down</a>), Robert Patrick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2/dp/B001RIY4WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2</a>), and Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones, Season 3) -- but none of these people are really given the opportunity to do much. Their characters fill a prescribed role, and the script doesn't really give them leeway to deviate.

The action is brisk, slick, and well-edited without being completely over-the-top. Our leads seem a little more prone to bruises and cuts than your average action movie protagonist. When Frost is waterboarded at the start of the film, he handles the torture stonily, but you can hear the wet rattle in his lungs and see him struggling for a good breath, even after the experience is over. Weston endures quite a beating, and although he makes it to the end of the film (come on; it's Ryan Reynold as the lead character; this isn't a spoiler) it's not without some serious costs.

It's all well and good and very, very familiar. The story doesn't have any new tricks up its sleeve, and although its presentation is nearly flawless, the plot's lack of depth, risk, or any inventiveness at all make the whole film feel like a loud, brassy, colorful way to twiddle your thumbs for two hours. ""That was a pretty good movie,"" my girlfriend said afterwards, ""but I can already tell I'm going to forget we even watched it by the end of the week."" She's right. Absent any really new elements to recommend it, the flick feels like a well-choreographed summary of a story that's been told many, many times before. If you have 110 minutes to kill and you don't necessarily care for surprises, it's a movie worth seeing. If your tastes are more discerning, probably not.",1342569600,2,3338,6.050739957716702

4726144,3,B005LAIGSC,"Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that as Denzel Washington gets older he's playing more and more characters with killer instincts? In SAFE HOUSE, Washington once more plays a character that you hope you never find tracking you down or waiting in your home.

The film opens with Washington meeting a member of MI6, Britain's spy agency, and receiving a microchip filled with information. Heading to the bathroom of the restaurant they're in, he injects it into his hip. When the bad guys come knocking on the restroom door Washington dispatches them with ease and escapes. The MI6 agent picks him up in his car but before they can get away he's shot. Washington makes his escape to the American consulate and turns himself in.

We discover that Washington's name is Tobin Frost, an ex-CIA agent who went off the grid and has been selling secrets to various organizations around the world. Considered a traitor, the consulate turns out to be in South Africa and he's to be taken to a safe house until a team can get to him and ""extract"" information from him.

The safe house is operated by a fairly new agent named Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). It's his first assignment with the CIA and he wants to impress, to move forward. He gets his chance when the information team arrives closely followed by the hit squad that was chasing Frost to begin with. They take out the team but before they can take Frost, Weston escapes with him only to be tracked down. They eventually escape but you know this assassination team will eventually find them.

Calling in, Weston is told that he needs to move forward to another location and pick up the means necessary to get Frost to another safe house in South Africa. After picking up the package with various items he needs at lockers in a crowded soccer stadium, Frost causes a scene claiming he's been kidnapped. The security believes him and ignores Weston's pleas only to have Frost kill his guards and escape. Weston follows suit and continues his chase of Frost.

But there's more going on here than a simple chase film. The movie is also about what caused Frost to become who he is today and watches as Weston alters from a totally innocent and naive agent into something much more deadly. The fact that Frost has a background in psychological warfare makes the viewer wonder is he just trying to mess with Weston's head or is he trying to help he get a view of the bigger picture? The answer to that question isn't offered until near the end of the film.

Another question that runs through the film is the fact that somewhere in the CIA there is a traitor. How is it that the assassination team knew where the safe house was? How have they been able to track down Frost as he moves from place to place? And who gave them the information that led them to him at the beginning of the film? As viewers we wonder about these questions. As a participant, Weston must try and find the answers to these questions as well, never knowing who is an ally or foe.

The film moves at a frantic pace with tons of car chases, gun fights and hand to hand combat sequences. Unlike the spy films of the past, people actually get shot, stabbed and bleed. There is a touch more realism here than spy films past. But that goes hand in hand with the story of undeserved loyalty and questions of deciphering who exactly the bad guy is.

Washington has never been better. There are subtle plays at work here he delivers that make you wonder if Frost is good, bad or indifferent. The answer is found by the end of the film. Reynolds does an equally great job portraying an innocence in his character that gets jaded as the film progresses. How he ends up, what he will become is also answered by the end of the film.

Most films like these today are compared less with Bond and more with Jason Bourne. This film is grittier than the Bourne films and much more so than the Bond series. It will hold your attention and have you guessing from start to finish as to what is actually on the microchip that Frost has possession of. It delivers the goods from start to finish an is well worth taking the time to sit back, watch and enjoy.",1342569600,,4157,4.4736147757255935

In this movies, Denzel's character is kind of bad, and I think he played his part very well, and Ryan Reynolds did a tremendous job, too. Reynolds almost made me cry when he was hurt in the end. I was almost in tears.

I will say the reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because I felt like there wasn't enough bite to it. I wasn't sitting off the edge of my seat waiting to see what was next. I wasn't breathless waiting to see if someone was going to get killed. At times, there was some cliches in there, but it wasn't overly in my face. I mean, I knew there was a mole when the safe house was instantly found, and it just came too early and too quick in the movie.

There are plenty of running, fighting, and chase scenes, not all in that order. It wasn't too complicated to follow. But like always, Denzel made the movie.

4726148,3,B005LAIGSC,"I almost went to see Safe House in the theater, and barely resisted the urge to blind-buy the Blu-ray, and I'm glad that I waited. After borrowing the movie from a friend, I know that I saved myself $20.

It's not that Safe House is terrible, it's just formulaic, mediocre, and badly-written.

The basic story is built around Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who looks after a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. The job involves a lot of sitting around, but he springs into action when he learns that Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a rogue CIA agent, has been captured, and will be delivered into his custody. When a recovery team, led by Agent Kiefer (Robert Patrick), is attacked and defeated, Weston is left to bring Frost in himself.

Weston is ambitious and wants to work at a more high profile location, but he's young and unproven in the eyes of his bosses. We are shown how he is regarded during an exchange involving his superiors, Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) and Linklater (Vera Farmiga), at HQ.

Imagine you were given the chance to write the screenplay. How would you make it stand out from previous entries in the genre? We have seen this subject handled well in the Bourne series, and reasonably well in Salt. Safe House doesn't belong in the same class.

What's wrong with the movie? The excellent cast is virtually ignored. Instead of establishing the characters and giving them depth, we are given very little background information. The front cover promises an adrenaline rush, and that's all that we are given. If you love action movies and don't care about the plot, Safe House delivers. But if you want to know why these events are occurring, it's not exactly an important part of the mix. There's a lot of gunfire, but meaningful dialogue is at a minimum.

If I had the pleasure of directing actors like Washington, Farmiga and Gleeson, I would make use of their abilities. Washington doesn't put a foot wrong, he's just given nothing to work with. Farmiga's screen time is extremely limited, but remember how effective she was in a similar role in The Departed? Gleeson is one of a kind and excelled in movies such as In Bruges and The Guard, but his character has no depth in Safe House. I see this as a wasted opportunity.

In the Bourne movies, we see how Jason Bourne meets his girlfriend, and how that relationship becomes meaningful. When she is threatened, we feel his pain and we react. Weston's girlfriend in Safe House may as well have been a cardboard cutout, and as a result, we feel nothing when he examines their relationship.

Safe House focuses on the action element. You'll see shootouts, car chases, explosions and people running. You might even understand why all this is happening, even though it's just a by-the-numbers screenplay. The movie grossed over $200 million and you won't scream for your money back, but I wouldn't bother buying the Blu-ray unless you are an action junkie. I love the cast, but against my expectations, I'm severely disappointed by the end result. Watch Bourne again instead, or watch Anton Corbijn's, The American, as that actually has some fresh ideas.",1342224000,6,3124,4.772222222222222

4726222,3,B005LAIGSC,"Denzel Washington: One of our greatest living actors. Ryan Reynolds: One of our most charismatic young leading men. A supporting cast of Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Sam Shepard. The subject of SAFE HOUSE: A young CIA case officer (Reynolds) and an extremely experienced former CIA agent-turned-traitor (Washington) are the latest in a series of mismatched, ""unlikely alliance"" partnership as they flee from a squad of hired killers. As they go along, the young agent is gradually feeling the influence of the older, hardened ""I know how things really work"" former agent. Does that last part sound familiar? Good, because it should, especially when it comes to Denzel.

The film opens with Reynolds proving how physical and buff he is by a few rounds with a punching bag, and a shower with his ridiculously sexy French girlfriend. Reynolds plays Matt Weston, a case officer for the CIA who's sole responsibility is being the ""housekeeper"" of a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. He comes in, checks the supplies, turns everything on and waits for something to happen, as he's apparently done for the previous twelve months, but nothing ever does. On the other side of the city, Tobin Frost (Washington) gets something from a contact, kills a man trying to kill him in a bathroom, gets shot at, crashes cars and runs to the US Embassy in Cape Town. His arrival prompts everyone back at Langley to go ape. Apparently Frost turned rogue nine years previously and he's been selling secrets to different countries during all that time, and is an expert at psych profiling and turning assets. So Shepard, playing a high-up muckity-muck directs this operation to get him moved to Weston's safe house, as lower echelon operators Gleeson and Farmiga quibble about how best to approach Frost. Of course once Frost gets to the safe house (and is waterboarded for good measure), several armed hostiles break in and impossibly kill all the trained men responsible for guarding Frost, but Weston gets Frost out, and they begin committing mayhem all around Cape Town with car chases, shoot outs, epic fisticuffs, more car chases and more shoot outs, while Frost does his best to get under Weston's skin and shake his conviction and the mystery of the information Frost has reveals some bad people amongst Weston's CIA handlers. Who is it? Is it Farmiga? Gleeson? Shepard?

The things that I will give this film is that it definitely has momentum, and there is some interesting chemistry between Washington and Reynolds. I say ""interesting"" because it's obvious that Reynolds, as charismatic as he is, is no match for Washington, but that's actually part of the point of this film, just in the way that Weston is no match for Frost, mentally or physically. The only thing that Weston still has is his belief, but no matter what because of how predictable the film plays itself out, you know that he's going to lose that belief by the end. The film does really move from one heart-stopping scene to another, though, and really that's the only thing that keeps this film decent.

From a performance standpoint, Washington is certainly not at the tip-top of his game, but he does deliver a strong performance here as someone who has obviously seen and done far too much. Reynolds plays the naive-yet-preternaturally-talented agent pretty well, considering they could have played more to his strengths as the cocky, rebellious type if they had decided to go down that road. The saddest thing here is the waste of supporting talent. Extremely talented character actors like Farmiga, Gleeson and Shepard are all stripped of the ability to play real characters and instead play cliches, and that's a shame. The villains of the piece are just there to shoot, fight and look menacing. Even strong but lesser-known actors like Joel Kinnaman (THE KILLING, the upcoming reboot of ROBOCOP) and Liam Cunningham (GAME OF THRONES and about every other British or Irish role out there) are given NOTHING to do here.

Director Daniel Espinosa, doing his first major Hollywood film here, throws a lot at us during the runtime of the film, consistently building momentum, but doesn't do anything particularly fresh here. His style seems to be a kind of mash-up of Tony Scott and Paul Greengrass, and they've done far better films than this.

Really when all is said and done, going to the SAFE HOUSE is a road we've taken many times in the past and some of those roads are a LOT better, but at least here, there are some interesting things to see during the journey.",1342137600,,4540,4.883268482490273

4726224,3,B005LAIGSC,"Very disappointed with this movie.  Denzel (Tobin Frost) was once more good at playing a shady character full of secrets secrets and more secrets.  But he was really the only interesting character through the whole movie.  There is the cliche CIA intrigue, good versus bad, agents with double motives.  Sadly it was all a little too cliche.  If you've seen the Bourne movies and have watched other spy movies then sadly you have seen Safe House.  It doesn't stand out in the genre as I had hoped it would. In fact it fall short of anything.

If I had to give a suggestion to anyone if you like Denzel you will like his character in this but the rest of the cast falls short by a mile.  And most importantly don't waste your money buying it because as said before if you own the Bourne trilogy you definitely don't need this on your shelf.  But if you just need a movie to rent and want to watch a movie with a bit of intrigue and tons of action (shooting, fist fighting, running on roofs, etc.) then by all means rent it watch it and forget about it.

Denzel Washington is a fugitive being watched by CIA agent Ryan Reynolds in a safe house. After an intense battle that sees the safe house breached, he now has to watch him whilst they're both on the run.

Is it any good?

I love action films just like any other person of the male gender, but if a film could ever be described as having too much action, this is it. The film begins with a bang with the safe house being attacked and the two protagonists escaping. But, by the middle of the film the actions scenes become almost repetitive, making the character development flimsy and uninteresting. At one point, after an admittedly awesome action scene lasting several minutes, they escape in a car, only to have their car taken out (no more that 20 seconds later), forcing them to run...cue action, again. Washington and Reynolds do admirable jobs; however, the direction was lazy and unstylistic and a laughably clich ending left me with an overall feeling of, `meh'.

Best bit?

4726373,4,B005LAIGSC,"4.3 stars

Denzel should play the bad guy all the time! He's a great good guy, but such a wonderfully semi-evil bad guy in this and Training Day. The big surprise here was Reynolds' quickly improving acting chops. Hanging with the big boys is showing him what real acting looks like, and like his character here he's a quick study. So there's the lesson for all you wanna-be leading men: it's easy, just marry then divorce the hottest actress in Hollyweird while honing your acting, then watch the great roles come rolling in. I think I'll try that out later this year. Anyone got SJ's cell number?

This flick has tons of good action and also a very intelligent script that asks many of the right questions about the CIA. It seems to suggest that plenty of the top Agency folks are corrupt at best, which is of course confirmed by so many ex-agents' memoirs. But seeing as the extras (which are quite good, lots of little docs) point out that a 30-year Agency vet did all the details here, you have to wonder, as always in the world of triple agents and daily media deceit, if we're not meant to think the CIA always finds and gets rid of their own bad guys. Uh huh.

Which makes the ending all the better, if just for its basic premise: speaking truth to power and doing the right thing trumps patriotism, in any country. Well, this is fiction after all. Gleeson is as usual perfect; this increasingly ubiquitous fellow is the next Michael Caine. But it's Reynolds who really carries this, being in almost every scene, and he looks like the next great all-around leading man at this point.
Denzel also has some truly fine moments, including the very disturbing waterboarding scene. Is this what we're fighting for? Nope, just corporate profits, naturally.

A very fast, well-made action spy-thriller with good acting and a tight script, Safe House also gets a fine blu-ray transfer, and it looks crisp and real. I think this one will be seen as a genre classic as time goes by.",1340928000,,1979,4.581920903954802

I'm glad my hero is not trying to pretend to be other than who he is....other than some hair dye here and there.

4726463,4,B005LAIGSC,"Safe House(Feb/12)is one of the few movies I have actually gone OUT to see in recent years,and I must say I was very impressed with it. This film ,once it gets started,just never stops;as the action is constant and can even at times take your breath away. The camera stays in fairly tight throughout which also adds to the intensity and immediacy of what you`re seeing. While the DVD`s sound cannot match the dynamics of the theatrical sound system(every shot,punch and bang sounded like a bolt of lightning packed into a millisecond)it still is quite good.
The plot involves a CIA safe house in Cape Town,South Africa. It is manned by one person,Matt Weston played by Ryan Reynolds. For almost a year he has been withering away in this stifling post and he has been itching for a transfer....anywhere. Into this relatively boring routine steps one Tobin Frost,played by Denzel Washington. Frost is a former member of the CIA,just like Weston,but who climbed the ladder and became a first class interrogator. Frost has obtained a list made by Israeli intelligence listing all the bad apples in similar organizations around the world. A friend in MI6 has given him the list and he is now on the run from those who wish that list captured and destroyed. In other words Frost is a dead man. He turns himself into the local US embassy and he is in turn moved into Weston`s safe house.
It is not long before the safe house itself is under attack and Weston is fleeing across town with his prisoner. Weston is ordered to go to a stadium during a soccer game to retrieve a GPS which will tell Weston the location of the nearest safe house. However during this time Frost manages to escape. Weston reports in that he has lost his prisoner and is also on the run from the local police himself,due to a scuffle at the stadium. Meanwhile Frost has gone to the house of an old friend to have him make him a passport. During this time Weston has an idea on where Frost may be and heads out. The men who attacked the safe house have followed Frost and are now bashing in the door of his friend`s home. His friend lies dead as he flees. Weston has arrived on the scene and helps save Frost and abscond with him to a new safe house.
Frost and Weston arrive at the new location and are just settling in when the safe house attendant turns on Weston and he is again in a struggle for his life. Weston barely comes out alive and he makes it back to Frost who he cuffed to a pipe in a room. Weston asks what exactly these people are after and Frost tells him exactly what it entails. Frost then grabs the cuff keys from a semi conscious Weston and escapes. When Weston regains consciousness he is in a bed with his CIA boss from the States beside him,asking what has happened and the whereabouts of Frost. The answer is not long coming as Frost suddenly reappears shooting his way back into the house to get Weston. Frost gets blindsided and shot by Weston`s boss and eventually dies. Weston`s boss is shot in turn by Weston and Weston now has the secret Frost carried.
Back at CIA headquarters Weston submits his report to the director who asks about the documents Frost had. Weston feigns innocence,knowing how damaging those secrets are. The film ends as the CIA and agencies of similar ilk around the world,have their top agents arrested for illegal activities. Frost`s original intentions come to fruition thanks to Weston.
The film starts out slowly as we are introduced to the two main characters. The moment Frost is driving away with his MI6 contact,who suddenly gets shot while driving,the heat,as they say,is on and the film never stops until the end. One doesn`t know who to trust and the cold,calculating killer and traitor that Frost is first portrayed as,starts to unravel,slowly but surely. And everywhere Frost goes,assassins follow,which is just another on-going mystery on top of many others thrown into the mix.
Washington and Reynolds are both outstanding in their roles and play their roles with an intensity that is right on the beam.

It's worth a rental, but it certainly isn't anything original or mind-blowing.  The ending is so commonplace, I figured it out half-way through.  I've seen this movie before, under a different title and with different actors.  I wish they'd give us an original spy film.

4726465,5,B005LAIGSC,"I would be extremely surprised if Swedish-born director Daniel Espinosa (he made 2010's superb thriller, ""Easy Money"" -- among others) hasn't watched and re-watched and then re-watched again the justly-celebrated films of writer-director Michael Mann (particularly ""Thief"", ""Manhunter"", ""Miami Vice"", ""Public Enemies"" and, most notably, ""Heat"") because this terrific, no-holes-barred 2012 thriller definitely calls to mind those seriously kick-ass awesome Mann movies -- ones that are, at once, both incredibly beautiful (i.e., the cinematography and the camerawork), but also rather ugly as well at times (i.e., the emotional and physical violence in them) -- as well as a number of similarly-terrific 1970s-era ""paranoid"" thrillers (such as ""Parallax View"", ""Black Sunday"", ""Marathon Man"", ""Twilight's Last Gleaming"", ""The Wilby Conspiracy"", and perhaps most pointedly, ""Three Days Of the Condor"").

(It also happily tips its hat more than once to Stanley Kramer's 1959 classic, ""The Defiant Ones"").

Much like 1973's CIA-oriented ""Three Days Of the Condor"", Espinosa's South African-set drama involves a dupe who doesn't KNOW that he's a dupe -- Redford in ""Condor""; an Oscar-worthy Ryan Reynolds here in ""Safe House"") -- and who eventually finds a verrrry unlikely ally (Faye Dunaway in ""Condor""; Denzel Washington in ""Safe House""), two men working for a government agency that both of them once trusted, but who no longer do (and probably very wisely so, as it turns out).

However, what makes ""Safe House"" REALLY stand out from ""Condor"", particularly, are the dazzling/jaw-dropping action sequences that deft screenwriter David Guggenheim and director Espinsosa intersperse throughout this relentless and extremely tense, two-hour drama. There's a superbly-staged car chase in Cape Town, a rooftop foot chase in a Johannesburg shanty town, and a number of hand-to-hand fighting sequences that are among the most believable (and, by extension, among the most gruesome) of any I've seen anytime recently in a mainstream Hollywood release ... all of which may at least partly explain why ""Safe House"" was such a huge, unqualified hit, not only in the U.S., but in the rest of the world as well (dazzling action set pieces tend to quite easily transcend language barriers).

But ""Safe House"" is also, at times, surprisingly MOVING as well -- which I think is another reason why this very smart and well-executed drama stayed with me longggg after I first it in a theater this past winter. There's a very palpable and powerful emotional gravity that runs throughout this movie, one that you almost never find in a big-budget Hollywood movie with this many dazzling action sequences in it (Michael Bay could definitely learn A LOT from Espinosa!!)

Ultimately, ""Safe House"" is a movie about the truly destructive nature of lies -- what they do to those of us who tell them ... and also what they do to those of us who are on the receiving end of them. Government officials around the globe would do well to heed this film's cautionary tale.

Sumptuous cinematography by Oliver Wood (""Die Hard 2"", ""Face/Off"", the three ""Bourne"" movies), with a haunting and spare score by Ramin Djawadi.",1340409600,,3186,5.286561264822135

4726521,4,B005LAIGSC,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Safe House is one of the many films I missed when it went into theaters. I recently rented, and watched, the film and I must say I was pretty impressed. Safe House stars big names Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. Everything I've seen with Reynolds in the past has had him as a fun, carefree, character. In Safe House Reynolds plays a man working for the CIA who has to guard a safe house in Africa. Throughout the film it's clear Matt Weston (Reynolds) is a very complex character. It seems as if he wants to enjoy his job, but isn't really satisfied with it. On top of that he has to lie to his girlfriend about working for the CIA. Overall I felt Reynolds did a phenomenal job, I hope to see him play more roles like this in the future.

Then we have Denzel Washington playing ex-CIA agent Tobin Frost. I must say over the years I have become very fond of Denzel as an actor. He always plays this calm, cool, collective badass who is two steps ahead of everyone. He always portrays a very strong, controlling, character. Well if you're a fan of Denzel nothing here is new. His character has all these traits, and no matter what happened in the film it seemed like just another day for Mr. Frost.

The story isn't terrible, and neither is the writing, but the strong point of this film is the acting. Not just from Denzel and Reynolds, but from the whole cast. I felt at times the story felt a little generic, and there were times where the camera was a little shaky or placed at a weird angle. These are things to be expected from an action flick, but you would think directors would learn from these little things. They can sometimes make the difference between a good movie and an excellent film.

Lastly the score composed by Ramin Djawadi is phenomenal. Not only does is fit the tone perfectly for each scene, but at times it makes the scene more intense which, for me, makes it more enjoyable. I'm definitely going to check out the soundtrack, just to see if it's as good as it is in the film.

Overall Score: 7.5/10 - Safe House does have it's flaws, but what film doesn't? What we are given is a strong action thriller with excellent acting from an amazing cast. I would definitely recommend watching this if you're given the opportunity.",1339977600,2,2302,4.4454976303317535

4726569,4,B005LAIGSC,"An exciting ""who done It"" mystery with a lot of lead flying everywhere and bodies piling up.  But, the story is the standard plot of corruption in an USA secret government department.  Bad persons, employees of the US government, are trying to kill the heroes with a lot of collateral damage.  In this movie it is the CIA government spy agency which results in innocent good hearted employee being used and almost murdered by corrupt CIA persons trying to keep secret bad things that the New York Times and Hollywood types think is bad and ""no-nos.""  What comes to the peoples rescue but the press.  What would we do without all the leaks the New York Times prints?  The USA and allies secret and spy organizations try to catch and find someone like the master mind behind the mass murder of Americans.  Are we not fortunate to have these leaks to the press even though it makes it more difficult for American secret government organizations to keep Americans safe?  An example harm done to those who help the US government keep Americans safe but are exposed by the Press is the Afghanistan doctor who helped the USA track down this mass murder, bin Ladden.  This doctor is now in an Afghanistan prison for 30 years.  This plot line of corrupt secret American government is so typical for American made movies.  The hero is working for the supposedly ""good guys"" secret government department meant to keep us safe from mass murderers who want to kill us in the name of Allah.  But, then suddenly we learn there is a corrupt element in the ""good guys"" secret department who is murdering others in order to keep secret their bad deeds.

Action - drama movies don't get much better than Safe House.
Ex-CIA agent Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) is believed to have flipped and began working freelance to the highest bidder. He's acquired a file from renegade MI6 agent Alec Wade (Liam Cunningham).
With hot-shot mercenaries on his tail he enters an American consulate, knowing he will be interrogated and most-likely tortured. He is quickly moved to a CIA'safe house in Cape Town, South Africa.
The ""housekeeper"" is a low on the totem-pole agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). Matt has been with the agency for a good while but has become bored since his assignment has been just to sit in that safehouse and wait. Nothing has happened until now. He has been lying to his girlfriend, Ana Moreau (Nora Amezeder) about what he does for a living.
The mercenaries learn where Tobin is being kept and systematically kill all the agents involved but Matt, who takes Tobin and goes into hiding.
Knowing the safe house was compromised Matt becomes leary of trusting anyone in the CIA. Tobin starts to get inside the young agent's head, telling him how's going to mess things up with his girlfriend and put his own life in danger.
Tobin eventually escapes, disguising himself as a police officer, and Matt gets detained by the police.
Now in a land he doesn't understand, clearly in over his head, Matt must escape and track down one of the most skilled operatives in the business.",1339545600,,1488,4.8352941176470585

Denzel will use any method to escape and Ryan must figure out a way to bring him in alive. The movie is full of action right up to the conclusion when both men must fight for their lifes.

He ends up in a Safe House run by young agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). The house is attacked by a group of unknown origins. The story soon becomes one of escape. Frost escapes from Weston, Weston escapes from the police, they both outrun the thugs and so on. They are always running away and escaping from unclear threats.

4726755,3,B005LAIGSC,"SAFE HOUSE is a movie looking for a story. It is a film that is packed with fine actors who've proved their chops many times, but here writer David Guggenheim has simply failed to give them a plausible, sensible story and all that is left after movie's end is confusion and a lot of smoke, fire, and debris and scratching of the head. Daniel Espinosa directs obtusely.

Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a bored but in love CIA rookie whose tedious assignment it is to man a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa: he longs for a European assignment but his position on the CIA totem pole is far too low for anything other than where he is, according to his boss Dave Barlow (Brendan Gleason). Things change rather abruptly when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) the CIA's most wanted rogue agent is captured and taken to the safe house. The CIA suddenly sees Matt's position as key and his bosses (Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard et al) see that they finally have caught the dangerous rouge CIA Tobin Frost. In interrogation ensues but during Frost's interrogation, the safe house is overtaken by mercenaries who want Frost. Weston and Frost escape and must stay out of the gunmen's sight until they can get to another safe house. From there on it is chase scenes segueing into chase scenes and very little makes sense to the point that few in the audience will care what happens.

Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington are always a delight to watch and even with this little bit of a mess of a movie they still make it watchable. The rest of the big name actors - Farmiga, Gleason, Shepard, Rub&eacute;n Blades, Robert Patrick, Liam Cunningham and Nora Arnezeder - are barely given enough lines to exist.

4726800,4,B005LAIGSC,The acting was well done. Denzel is as good as always. Ryan Reynolds did a fabulous job. The two characters actually worked well together. The action was better than most films.

4726806,3,B005LAIGSC,"This movie is a bourne wannabe.  Centered around the CIA and intelligence community, it has lots of fast action with hand-held cameras and frequent cuts within each scene.  I'd say it's a fairly well directed movie with good cinematography.

Where it falls short, in my opinion, is the characters - and particularly the main character.  The main character is a youngish agent who is proprietor of a safe house.  He's bored; and he wants to prove himself.  He has a girlfriend - and he tells her that he's in some benign profession (he doesn't want her to know he's CIA).

Denzel Washington plays a renegade (former) agent carrying some high-stakes intel.

The main character (the youngish agent, who's name escapes me) remains undeveloped throughout the movie.  And as a consequence, I had no reason to care about him.  Denzel Washington's character was marginally developed; and I barely cared about him.  The young agent's girlfriend communicated her feelings fairly well (although she had hardly any part to play in the movie); and by the end of the movie, I cared about her.

Despite the fast action and constant threats against the two main characters, I found the movie generally boring.  So I say to the writers, the director, and the actors:  make me care!

And by the way, the red lipstick on that CIA woman just drove me crazy!",1332374400,2,1337,4.802631578947368
4726807,3,B005LAIGSC,"It's been a long time since there's been reason to be excited over a Denzel Washington movie. Ever since his Oscar win for his heelish turn in Training Day, the actor has mostly been content to coast along in exciting, but not terribly challenging thrillers alongside bland co-stars. It's like someone is constantly trying to find a way to recreate the Training Day magic between Washington and Ethan Hawke. Denzel is always the coolest guy in the room, the one with the confidence and steely reserve that everybody else in the movie lacks. His smile indicates he knows something nobody else does, and there's never really any doubt he'll succeed. That same formula is employed yet again in Safe House, but with an abundance of style thanks to Swedish director, Daniel Espinosa, that makes this an intense thrill ride worth checking out even if feels a touch familiar.

Washington's muted co-star this time is Ryan Reynolds, playing bored, untested CIA agent Matt Weston. Matt has pretty much everything he could want: a supremely hot girlfriend who adores him, equally unfair good looks himself, and a cushy position house sitting a safe house in the heart of Cape Town, South Africa. That's not enough for him, though, as he yearns to step out into the field and really earn his stripes.

The phrase ""Be careful what you wish for"" comes back to bite Matt in the rear end when ex-CIA agent turned international terrorist Tobin Frost comes waltzing into a nearby embassy and turns himself in. He's got something that has kicked up a violent hornet's nest of activity, with all the world's assassins looking to put a bullet in him and take it. What is it? Doesn't really matter, and the script doesn't seem all that concerned with it, either. The only thing that matters is that Frost can't go anywhere without someone looking to put a knife in his back, and even the CIA safe house he's holed up in is stormed by armed killers.

Frost hardly seems phased, even as he's forced to go on the run with a green as grass agent like Weston. Actually, Frost seems to revel in the experience gap, twisting Weston's mind like a pretzel even as he fights for his life, surviving one ridiculous shoot out or car chase after another. Not even the threat of waterboarding seems to phase Frost, as he's more concerned with the type of towel being used on him. His calm, while fun to watch thanks to Denzel's icy charms, is also a little irritating considering the seriousness of the situation

The heavily lauded script by David Guggenheim lacks sufficient twists and witty banter, and you'll see the big swerve coming from a hundred yards away. How it landed on the Black List, Hollywood's annual selections of the best unproduced screenplays, is beyond me. The pace remains at a breakneck speed throughout, but what you want is more of Frost spinning Weston's head like a dreidle. We just don't get nearly enough of it, and too much of the rather weak mystery of a corrupt official within the CIA. What? A corrupt government agent in a spy thriller? Surely you jest. Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson are wasted in this go nowhere subplot, which pans out exactly as you think it does. Ryan Reynolds is just over matched in every conceivable way opposite Denzel. While it's good to see him not playing the wise cracking pretty boy for once, his character is too weak to shine.

It's amazing how every Denzel Washington film ends up looking like Tony Scott-lite. Daniel Espinosa, who showed he's a talent to watch after his nervy crime pic, Snabba Cash(known here as Easy Money), initially falls into the same category before settling into a serious groove. His style remains kinetic and and a little crazy at times, but he manages to find moments of calm where Scott can't stay on any scene longer than two seconds. The firefights brutal hand-to-hand brawls have a Bourne Identity feel to them, dizzying and visceral.

So it's another solid outing for Denzel, one he can do in his sleep. The film will get your blood pumping, and might even make you laugh once or twice. It just could have been a lot better, with a stronger co-star and better script. Now if only Denzel would leave the safe house his career has been shacked up in and take some risks.",1332288000,6,4237,4.688172043010753
4726818,4,B005LAIGSC,"You're in a position that requires very little of you and have been for some time. Then you hear your significant other is getting a new job nearly 6,000 miles away and begin angling for a transfer but before you can get it you are dropped in a situation unlike any you've ever been in. What do you do?

  Matt Weston (played by Ryan Reynolds) is the guardian of a CIA safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. While he is required to conceal the true nature of his workplace and his employer, once he's entered the office, turned on the lights and locked the door behind him, he's done just about everything he needs to do that day. Meanwhile, the Agency's most wanted fugitive, CIA agent turned traitor Tobin Frost (played by Denzel Washington) has been arrested in a nearby embassy while trying to escape the men who'd already murdered his business contact. Senior management at the Agency is stunned and determined to find out what Frost (Washington) was running from in addition to ascertaining the true extent of the damage he's already done since going rogue more than ten years earlier. However, before Frost cooperates, hostile forces break through the facility's defenses and assassinate Frost's armed escorts. Soon Weston (Reynolds) is on the run with Frost in tow all while trying to keep them both alive and deliver Frost to the intended destination.

  If you've seen Enemy of the State, Man on Fire, Unstoppable, or Spy Game, you'll no doubt recognize the directing style of Tony Scott in this latest film starring Denzel Washington. The problem being that the director of this film is a man by the name of Daniel Espinosa and while I am a fan of Scott and his films, it shows a considerable lack of imagination on Espinosa's part to direct his films in a near-identical manner. Putting that aside, Washington is exceptional as he often is, Reynolds is surprisingly good and spares us the sarcasm we've come to love and expect from him, and supporting players Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Sam Sheppard make the sub-plot almost as interesting as the main story. I enjoyed it a lot.",1332115200,3,2098,4.734246575342466
4726819,4,B005LAIGSC,"Daniel Espinosa's ""Safe House"" is an efficient spy thriller that gives viewers a gratifying number of heart-pounding moments, even though it evaporates from the memory fairly quickly. Denzel Washington plays Tobin Frost, a rogue ex-CIA operative captured in Cape Town and brought in for questioning. Through a series of violent events that is no fair to reveal, Frost ends up in the care of rookie agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), whom Frost openly mocks as a greenhorn. The car chases and shootouts in ""Safe House"" are absolutely state-of-the-art, and the screenplay is clever enough to blend the plot exposition in neatly with the action. It's too bad, then, that none of the characters is really memorable, even though the film boasts a glittering cast--not only Washington and Reynolds but also Sam Shepard, Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, Robert Patrick and Ruben Blades, all playing characters who may or may not be what they seem. ""Safe House"" will give you a good time if you like the espionage thriller genre, but don't expect anything more.",1331424000,4,1051,5.08092485549133
4726820,5,B005LAIGSC,I thought it was good even if most professional reviewers hated it. Very exciting movie. I left the theatre saying it was better than the Bourne movies. The script is pretty tight and the acting is good.,1331424000,28,203,4.513513513513513
4726821,3,B005LAIGSC,"Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a CIA Agent eager for a new assignment. After almost a year as the ""landlord"" of a safe house in Cape Town, he wants to transfer to a more high-profile gig. He spends his days bouncing a ball against the walls, trying to stave off boredom. He is surprised to get a last minute reservation; the CIA has captured Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a notorious and very dangerous ex-CIA agent who is now considered a traitor. No sooner has Frost been brought in than a group of renegades break into the safe house and start shooting. Matt manages to smuggle Tobin out and the chase begins.

Written by David Guggenheim (his second film) and directed by Daniel Espinosa (his first Hollywood film), ""Safe House"" has all the makings of a top-notch thriller directed by Tony Scott. In fact, I thought it was a Tony Scott film when I saw the trailer for the first time. But that isn't a compliment.

The film begins by establishing both lead characters. We spend a significant amount of time watching Tobin weave in and out of the crowds and dark alleyways of Cape Town. Eventually, he meets another agent and buys a chip containing some very damaging information. Once he takes possession, it seems like everyone is out to get him. But Tobin has some moves and manages to escape them every time. Well, almost every time...

Matt wakes up next to his beautiful French girlfriend and they talk about the future. She wants to move back to France and he is itching for a different assignment. He pushes his mentor (Brendan Glesson) to get him reassigned. At lunch, she says she doesn't have to be at work for an hour, they should go back home and make love. At work, he walks the empty halls of the 'clinic' and eventually starts bouncing a ball against the wall.

All of this is actually interesting because it helps to establish and build each of these characters, giving us some insight into their lives and we realize each one is in a very different place with a completely different skill set. Through the course of the chase, each person will have to rely on the other and use their skills to help both of them survive.

Once the men break into the safe house and start shooting, everything starts to go wrong.

As soon as Tobin arrives, he size up Matt. The men who have captured Tobin push the younger agent to one side, treating him like the insignificant innkeeper he is. Nothing escapes Tobin's eyes and he turns on the Hannibal Lecter-ese; the crazy, super-intelligent mad man persona. He starts to goad Matt, saying things like ""Tick Tock"" to get the younger, less experienced agent to make a rash decision. He doesn't expect Matt to be of any consequence.

Matt is inexperienced, but because he wants a more exciting post, he isn't about to let anything happen to Tobin and smuggles him out steps ahead of the men who stormed the safe house.

Once Matt and Tobin start to run through the streets, trying to evade the men, the film becomes incredibly routine.

These characters are a fun thing to watch. For a few minutes. And then you realize you have seen these types of performances a million times before. It just becomes so boring, so quickly.

Washington is a great actor and always brings a palpable intensity to his performances. And Tobin Frost is no exception. From the moment we first set eyes on Tobin, we know there is something going on beneath the surface. He isn't telling everything to everyone. He has some ulterior motive to his actions.

But he has done this type of character before. And there really isn't anything new in this portrayal.

I think Washington is a cinematic tour de force, but he needs better direction. He works with Tony Scott on an abnormally frequent basis. Many successful directors and actors have created legacies together. Scorcese and DeNiro and DiCaprio. Hitchcock and Grant and Stewart. Ford and Wayne. Huston and Bogart. There are many, many more. And you can just tick off the names of movies that will stand the test of time associated with each of these teams. On the flipside, many successful, well-known actors continue to work with the same people. This doesn't stretch their talents and they continue to make the same films. Washington has the talent to join DeNiro, Grant and Stewart. He doesn't deserve to be lumped in with actors like Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler.

Ryan Reynolds has made an interesting transformation over the last few years. He used to do a lot of broad comedies, a lot of comedies filled with low brow humor. Then, he made ""The Proposal"" and has been in some action films, transforming his whole persona, trying to become a big-time movie star. His status is certainly on the rise, but the lackluster performance of ""Green Lantern"" and ""The Change-Up"" last summer didn't help. But what the diversity of his films shows is that he can do action, he can do comedy, he can do low brow. He is also a very good-looking guy, which doesn't hurt. People obviously see the potential and believe he will deliver on it.

Reynolds does a nice job with Matt. We immediately get who he is; his ambitions, his unfulfilled promise, his boredom. These all paint a very different picture of who he actually is. Than, all of a sudden, everything in his life changes and he will have to use all of the long-dormant skills and lessons, many never used and only learned, to stay alive.

""Safe House"" holds a lot of promise, but it has a number of problems creating the equivalent of a wash. It isn't a good thing when your film is reminiscent of Tony Scott's work. When someone mentions Tony Scott, my guess is the first thing you will think of is over-editing. Editing is an art form, used to tell a story, to keep the audience engaged. How is it possible for anyone to get engaged in a story when no shot lasts more than a few seconds? Can you watch a film with a constantly moving hand-held camera? No. These are the tell-tale signs of Scott's work. It almost seems like he uses the over-editing to hide his lack of story telling ability and his lack of creativity. Because he doesn't give us time to concentrate on anything, it is more difficult for most to notice the problems. Espinosa is clearly influenced by Scott. Too bad he didn't look to Ridley, Tony's brother, for inspiration.

If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Using that philosophical question lets take a brief look at this suspense film. One of the key factors to a successful suspense film is that it surprises the viewer. If a suspense film doesn't have any surprises, can the audience enjoy it? Very early on, you will be able to guess who is pulling all of the strings behind the scenes. When this becomes evident, the film just becomes a long chase and you will probably be able to guess how that will end. And the little twists and turns are all predictable as well because they have to happen. The filmmakers know they need to keep us guessing, so they throw in these little moments, these little surprises.

""Safe House"" is okay. But it promises much more than it delivers. And for that reason, it is truly disappointing.",1331251200,3,7137,4.589481946624804
4726822,4,B005LAIGSC,"This was an enjoyable movie.  Toby Frost (Denzel Washington) was a former CIA agent who has been gone for 10 years.

There was no cussing, no nudity but a lot of viloence although I thought the violence was more of a suggested than actual visual like some movies.
