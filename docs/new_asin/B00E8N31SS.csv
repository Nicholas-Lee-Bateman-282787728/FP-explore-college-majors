8602596,5,B00E8N31SS,Was exactly as described and arrived quickly. Looking forward to yet another super teaching from Louie Giglio.,1424476800,,110,5.529411764705882
8602597,5,B00E8N31SS,I am nearly 80 years old and was recently introduced to Louie Giglio's How Great Is Our God series on DVD.  Since that first encounter I have purchased every one of his available DVDs for myself and many titles as gifts for family members.  The Fruitcake and Ice Cream DVD was wonderful; Passion 2013 was amazing and introduced me to Francis Chan and Beth Moore; and Hope - When Life Hurts The Most was healing.  Louie's Prayer Remix and Grace DVDs are amazing and life changing.  I am recommending his teachings to anyone who will listen and also loaning them out to others.  The most important thing is I  am applying what I have learned.  I am reaching out to others with the love of Jesus and am expanding  my prayer life and Bible study.  Rarely watch TV anymore because I just want to seek my Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus.  Although Louie's focus is on the teen and college population his teachings are truly ageless.  I will be ordering Louie Giglio's new releases on Amazon as they become available because their service was excellent.,1411344000,4,1048,4.580645161290323
8602598,5,B00E8N31SS,Arrived promptly and packaged well. This is another awesome set of messages from one of my favorite preachers. His enthusiasm for spreading the gospel is infectious. Would recommend for anyone wanting to get a little kick in the pants to get up and share what God can do with a life surrendered to Him.,1397865600,3,302,4.611111111111111
