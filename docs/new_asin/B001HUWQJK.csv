The opening scene of Lili Taylor's character becoming overwhelmed at her wedding and passing out in Mystic Pizza. There are also many classic scenes from ""Say Anything"" such as when John Cusack's character (Lloyd Dobler) hangs out with guys at the Gas n' Sip to learn about women after his girlfriend breaks up with him. Also Say Anything was filmed in beautiful Seattle, Washington in all it's '80's glory.",1436140800,,532,4.9222222222222225
