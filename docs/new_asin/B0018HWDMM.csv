8269853,5,B0018HWDMM,The Oval Portrait was released in 1972. It starred Barry Coe. A good thriller ala Dark Shadows. Also known as One Minute Before Death and One Minute Before Midnight. Fans of Barry Coe will like this the most.,1506816000,,208,4.5
8269854,2,B0018HWDMM,"I remember watching this with my mom back in the late 70s/ early 80s. As a much older adult now, I realize that this bears no resemblance to Poe's short story ""The Oval Portrait"" and can't imagine how the filmmakers got away with naming it as such. The story has more to do with the forbidden romance between a Yankee gentleman's daughter and a Confederate soldier back during the Civil War. The young girl's portrait is haunted by her restless spirit and affects the present-day occupants of the house which houses the portrait.

No scares here - just cheap effects and stilted dialogue plus below average acting. For some reason, I am compelled to watch these films till the end mainly because of the nostalgia factor but this is really not worth anyone's time. The two stars is for pure nostalgia.",1426982400,,800,4.673758865248227

8269856,5,B0018HWDMM,it wasn't the oval portrait that poe wrote. its based on a love story between a confederate soldier and a yankees daughter. don't read the back of it it makes you expect a dif ending than what it is.,1402531200,,199,4.128205128205129
8269857,1,B0018HWDMM,"THE OVAL PORTRAIT is a non-frightening, sub-soap opera quality ""horror"" movie from 1972. It concerns a family haunted by the ghost of Rebecca, who died many years prior, under suspicious circumstances. Her portrait hangs over the fireplace, and her spirit roams the house. Unfortunately, this film suffers from horrid acting, ding-a-ling dialog, and absurd situations. This movie is a preposterous affair, loaded w/ schlock-y cheeeze, and enough ultra-dramatic music to re-sink the Titanic! If it weren't so abysmally dull, it could have been a sublime masterpiece. Alas, watching this is like wading through an ocean of treacle...",1400976000,,631,5.515463917525773
8269858,3,B0018HWDMM,If you like creepy movies from long ago then you will like this.  It made an impression on me as a kid so I had to see it again!,1363564800,,128,3.413793103448276
8269859,1,B0018HWDMM,"It seems some of Poe's classics should not be made into film. In this tale a family gets together for the reading of a will at a house that appears to be haunted by the ghost of Rebecca, whose oval portrait appears on the wall. The haunting effects are poor, as in turning a camera on/off poor, something that dates from the 1920's. We do find out about Rebecca which consumes much of the film.

Originally released in 1972 as ""One Minute Before Death."" It has a low budget Mexican feel to it. The acting wasn't great either.

Parental guide: No f-bombs, nudity, or sex between two living people.",1350518400,,596,4.458715596330276
