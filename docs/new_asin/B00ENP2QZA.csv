5928951,5,B00ENP2QZA,This was a really good presentation of that fateful day in November 1963.  I was pleased with the quality of the tapes and the information that was presented....it gave me a sense of being a part of the day.  This is a nice addition to my collection.,1394064000,3,250,4.297872340425532
5928952,5,B00ENP2QZA,"As an avid fan of JFK, I was pleased with this dvd. It seems that there is always something new to learn and that's true of this dvd.",1389052800,2,133,3.7857142857142856
5928953,5,B00ENP2QZA,"Very poignant - mostly because the presentation and commentary were understated, letting the event itself have some of the impact which it had at the time. There have been plenty of revisionist programmes over the years, and that's important too: but the purpose of this one was to re-create the event, which it did with great skill and taste. I'm sure I shall watch it again from time to time, but only as often as I can bear to, even now.",1388707200,9,440,4.444444444444445
5928954,5,B00ENP2QZA,I really enjoyed this movie! I learned several facts that I didn't know even tho I still remember that day! I was in the 2nd grade however I still remember clearly that day and the several days that followed it. The DVD includes much of the original footage that still make me cry plus footage that I have never seen! I Highly Recommend it to Everyone!,1386288000,15,352,4.348484848484849
5928955,1,B00ENP2QZA,"This dvd is 100% behind the ""Oswald did it"" syndrome with no redeeming features apart from picture quality. Any evidence which
points the finger at CIA/MOB involvement is avoided. I cannot be bothered to review in detail as this dvd could have been made
in 1964,after the Warren Commission wrote the script. Dull beyond belief....",1385856000,15,330,5.0181818181818185
5928956,5,B00ENP2QZA,This is the best coverage of Kennedy in Dallas I have seen so far. Kevin Spacey narrated and there was a lot of color film and good variety of people interviewed.,1385683200,6,162,4.258064516129032
5928957,5,B00ENP2QZA,Brings back memories of the day. I was a young teenager growing up in Chicago and the 1960 campaign was my first political lesson.,1385337600,,130,4.458333333333333
5928958,4,B00ENP2QZA,"On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as he rode in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Texas.  That is a fact beyond dispute. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of JFK's untimely death, a remarkable collection of exclusive footage reconstructs the story as it happened, moment-by-moment.

Kevin Spacey narrates the story of that tragic day through the memories of some of the people who played a part in those extraordinary events - from the journalist who was with the Kennedy family all day to the nurse who checked his vital signs at Parkland Memorial Hospital to the cop who was with Oswald when he was murdered by Jack Ruby.  New interviews and striking, rarely seen footage and photos make vivid the emotions and drama of that day.  In all fairness, it must be noted that this Smithsonian sanctioned production comes with the imprimatur of the federally funded institute and as expected, there is no deviation from the official government approved scenario of Oswald as the lone shooter.  Even a superficial examination of the now massive evidence raises doubts to the notion that Oswald acted alone - if indeed he acted at all.  That said, this is a remarkable collection of images, impressions and memories.

If this documentary had included any elements that alluded to the multitude of doubts that Oswald acted alone as well as the many eyewitness accounts of another shooter, I would have given this otherwise fine compilation 5 stars.",1382486400,41,1492,5.016194331983805
5928959,2,B00ENP2QZA,"Given all that has been revealed about the Kennedy assassination over the past 50 years, three is little reason to buy, or even spend your time watching, this documentary.

Here's the scoop. The point to this particular documentary seemed to be that the producers found a lot of unseen footage and conducted interviews with people not previously dealt with. Nothing of significance is added to what is already known and great pains seem to have been taken to avoid dealing with the whole (obvious) conspiracy involved.

On the good side the viewer does get to see a lot of footage not seen prior. You also get interviews with the key secret service guy on duty that day. Also heard from are a couple of reporters, the guy who drove Oswald to work that day and a few others. On the bad side is the fact they simply did not want to address the conspiracy, even when it was painful to avoid it. At one point they mention the officer who got a cut on the face from some concrete that flew up from a bullet that ricocheted off a curb. Wait! Isn't that a significant fact that begs for further scrutiny? And police captain Will Fritz trying to convince viewers that Oswald was proud, lone nut assassin just doesn't ring true given everything else we know. It were as though these film makers just wanted to tow a line that has a mountain of evidence available to refute it.

The one good thing here is seeing all the new footage. Other than that I would not trust the content as being any in depth investigation of what really happened.",1448582400,2,1530,4.476702508960574
5928960,1,B00ENP2QZA,"Review of Smithsonian Channel: The Day Kennedy Died, narrated by Kevin Spacey, directed by Leslie Woodhead (2013) at
http://www.amazon.com/Smithsonian-Channel-The-Kennedy-Died/dp/B00ENP2QZA
Neither the narrator nor the director seems even slightly aware that their reporting of the event renders conspiracy in the killing of President Kennedy the only, inevitable conclusion:
1. Clint Hills description of Jackies climb onto the trunk of the limo to retrieve a portion of JFKs skull surely confirms a shot from the front.
2. Bill Neumans description of a shot from behind him surely confirms a shot from the front.
3. Gayle Neumans description of her panic being in the line of fire surely confirms a shot from the front.
4. Buell Frasors description of the corrupt pressure of Captain Will Fritz to suborn a confession from him surely reveals the unreliability of the Dallas Police.
5. Johnny Brewers statement that Oswald had repeatedly shouted I am not resisting arrest in the Dallas Theater surely gives one pause as to the truth of him pulling a gun and pointing it at the head of the arresting officerthey were arresting a supposed assassin and cop killerdid they not have their guns pulled and why did they not shoot a desperado who was pulling a gun on themit obviously is fiction and Johnny Brewer knows it, but not these presenters.
6. Showing Kuldiffs press conference and leaving out the part of him pointing to his temple and saying that it was simply a matter of a bullet to the head surely confirms that the doctors told him it was a shot from the front--and there is no mention of the entry wound to the throat, which was mentioned three separate times at the medical press conference.
The presenters even have a second eyewitness attest to the shot to the temple, hardly bolstering their Krazy Kid theory.
7. Presenting Ruth Paine as a simple innocent Quaker is a bit much in this 50th year after the event, when she is proven to be a CIA handler of Lee and Marina Oswald.
8. Parading out longtime CIA apologist and protagonist Hugh Aynesworth as a credible witness to this event is a bit like citing CIA director Dulles for the truth.  See Article on Aynesworth at CTKA.net
9. Presenting a witness who says the shots went bang..bang, bang is not too bright as well, as it takes the Italian Carcano out of the picture and exonerates the lone nut!  See Harvey & Lee website ""Oswald did not Order a Rifle"".
10. Presenting Dr. McClelland to attest to the right rear blow out of the cerebellum area of JFKs brain is imbecilic as it confirms a shot from the front and defeats the single bullet theory.
11. In truth, Clint Hill, the great protector of Jackie, is fully on record to the same effect, having viewed the blowout of JFKs right rear brain when he was looming over his body in the limo on the way to Parkland.  These people simply do not know the meaning of what they saw and accurately report.
If I watched it again, I would find 11 more serious slips that render its impact worthless, other than as a chronicle of video footage and reporting, and a repetition of the lone nut theory of the Warren Commission.  The effect is a total repudiation of the official theory.",1447027200,3,3190,4.721723518850988
5928961,5,B00ENP2QZA,If you're a history buff like I am you should enjoy this documentary. Great archival video footage and previously unseen witness interviews. It expands upon one of the worst days in U.S. history.,1441929600,,195,4.9393939393939394
5928962,5,B00ENP2QZA,"I had seen this on TV, and thought it had the most actual eyewitness testimony of any documentary I have ever seen - particularly that of Jackie Kennedy's personal Secret Service agent.  This, along with a companion movie, Parkland, provides a great deal of accurate information about the events surrounding the Kennedy assassination, with only a few discrepancies between them.",1439942400,2,378,5.3

5928972,5,B00ENP2QZA,Great DVD. I read books on the assassination but they have interviews with people I did not read about. Anyone who reads about the assassination of JFK should get this.,1416787200,,168,4.633333333333334

5928975,4,B00ENP2QZA,"This documentary, a moment by moment chronicle of the day President Kennedy died, is very informative presenting personal interviews with many of the people who were present on that day. Some of it I have heard before and some not, some photos I have seen before and some not, so I found it to be very interesting.

From my perspective this DVD had no intention to prove or disprove the `conspiracy theory', and anyone seeking a definitive answer to that question will have to keep looking.  It made available, with a time-line, the events of that day, stating the facts, nothing more, nothing less.",1401494400,6,599,4.75
5928976,5,B00ENP2QZA,Very interesting dvd which even enhances the reason his death could be a conspiracy.  I have viewed several of these documentary and I highly recommended this dvd.,1399939200,2,163,5.037037037037037

8607077,4,B00ENP2QZA,Not your usual Kennedy documentary. This includes some never before seen interviews with ppl that had a connection to that fateful day. I'm not saying you're going to learn anything new. You will just see different perspectives and emotions. Don't expect any theories on the shooting or the grassy knoll. This is about the lead up and aftermath of the shooting itself.,1494028800,,368,4.951612903225806
8607078,4,B00ENP2QZA,I watched this on Netflix and was very impressed except for the interview parts with Hugh Aynesworth who is some sort of reporter in Dallas he comes across as mysngonistic and racist.  Hopefully an anomaly for Dallas,1491177600,,216,4.837837837837838
8607079,2,B00ENP2QZA,It's interesting to see the footage & photographs but that's about the only interesting thing. Would be better if that's all they did instead of adding a narrative.,1486339200,,164,4.892857142857143
8607080,4,B00ENP2QZA,Captures that dark moment in history well.,1486166400,,42,5.142857142857143
8607081,5,B00ENP2QZA,I was in middle school during the Kennedy presidency. That was a very innocent time for our country. I wanted to add it to my collection.,1483142400,,137,4.3076923076923075

8607083,4,B00ENP2QZA,Well done if you are an objective viewer . . . If you are a conspiracy buff you will hate it because it follows common sense . . .,1469577600,,130,3.5172413793103448
8607084,5,B00ENP2QZA,"Nothing new here, but after 50+ years we'll never know the truth anyway.  Found it interesting when I first saw it on TV, had taped it onto VHS at that time. So this was bought as a replacement for that. If you weren't alive in 1963, and you're a teacher, you might want to look at one of the most defining moments in the history of the United States if not the world at that time and pass it along to your students.",1469232000,,416,4.0120481927710845
8607085,5,B00ENP2QZA,"Great for Kennedy assassination buffs collections, some old stuff a little new but worth watching, Kevin Spacey is a great narrator.  Would recommend.",1455667200,,150,5.521739130434782
8607086,2,B00ENP2QZA,"This ""documentary"" continues the cover-up of the truth of the JFK assassination. As I watched it today I was very dissapointed at how it was edited to show only what the official story would have us believe.",1448841600,4,207,4.621621621621622
