The fact that they use the ""State of Eritrea"" as a title is a clear example of their deceptive behavior. Thank god it is not on shelves anymore. If you truly want to learn about Eritrea go visit for yourself. The NGOs who have a big hand in developing refugee camps along with a brutal and truly undemocratic minority govt. in Ethiopia have dictated how this film was made, therefor making it an insult to our intelligence.",1447804800,,539,4.625

8642585,1,B003N974S6,"I was really dissatisfied with this product, it took over three weeks to get to me. When it came, to my chagrin the language was in tigrinya. There were no sub-titles in english. I gave it to one of my Eritrean friends and after he watched it, he told me he was insulted because it was based on Ethiopian propoganda about his country. The box cover of the DVD is in english and it just really seemed misleading to advertise the movie in this way.",1313193600,2,446,4.258823529411765

8642589,5,B003N974S6,"The producer of 'The State of Eritrea' has done a great job. This video will show you the plight of Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia. I was so surprised to see such young Eritreans fleeing the country and get refuge in Ethiopia. The video does not seem to be edited. It is an honest assessment of Eritrena refugees in Ethiopia. I hope, Mr. Surafeal Wolday, will also produce the same video on Eritrean refugees in Sudan, Egypt and Libya. This video is a must see video.

No wonder pictures speak louder than words. Just buy the video and watch it with friends and families and have an honest discussion. I am convinced that the Eritrena government is not telling the truth to his own people especially to those of us in Diaspora. This video will clearly show you what is going on on the mind of Eritrean refugees. I was in shock when I was about twenty Eritrean youth under 16 who left the country without their parents. Some of them were as young as ten. Why all this happening to Eritrea. This video will answer all the questions you may have about Eritrean Refugees in Ethiopia.

Another interesting point is that Ethiopians who were interviewed in this video said that the border war was not between the two people - it was rather created by two governments. All of them were calling for peaceful coexistence between the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea. This video is in deeded an eye opener. Mr. Surafeal Wolday has done a great service to the people of the Horn in general and the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea in particular. Enjoy watching the video!",1275955200,2,1554,4.566308243727598
