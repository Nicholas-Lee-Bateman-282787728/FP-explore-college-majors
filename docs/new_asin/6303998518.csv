7858655,4,6303998518,"This video consists of three upper body workouts which are designed to be performed either together or separately when you have less time.  It is led by Petra Kolber, a competent fitness instructor who provides good form pointers.  Petra works out with two assistants, one of whom shows easier modifications and one of whom occasionally displays a more challenging option.  Since hand weights are used, this program adapts to any fitness level simply by increasing or decreasing the weights.
The video begins with a 4 1/2 minute warmup.  I found some of the moves here to be a bit awkward, and in the future, I will probably skip this section.  Workout #1 is 8 1/2 minutes long, and the time really flies by.  You will do standard moves such as pushups, single rows, double bicep curls, and tricep kickbacks, performing 12 reps of each exercise.  The second program is the shortest at only 6 1/2 minutes.  This program starts with pushups, which was tough when peformed immediately after the first workout!  You will again do 12 reps, but this time, you will follow a different counting pattern:  reps 1-4 are 2 counts up, 2 counts down, reps 5-8 are 3 counts up, one count down, and reps 9-12 are 1 count up, 3 counts down.  This pattern continues for the remainder of the exercises, all of which are performed sitting in a chair and which include double rows, single biceps, shoulder press, and tricep dips.  The final program is also 8 1/2 minutes long.  You will do similar exercises to work your shoulders, biceps, and triceps, but this time, you will perform combinations of moves in a pattern.
The workout ends with a quick, 2 1/2 minute stretch, again using the chair.  Although Petra offers enough instruction to make beginners feel comfortable, she talks while performing the movements, so more advanced exercisers won't find themselves bored.  This video is a great way to get in some solid weight training for the upper body in a short amount of time.",1086652800,3,1963,4.7492625368731565
