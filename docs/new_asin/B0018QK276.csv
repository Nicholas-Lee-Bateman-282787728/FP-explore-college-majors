8270692,3,B0018QK276,"This particular episode leaves a lot to be desired; although it moves along rather well none of the characters were compelling enough to develop any empathy or concern for what happened to them. It does poke some fun at British traditions which can go back hundreds of years and are faithfully followed although the reason they got started is no longer relevant.

There is also one murder which is done in a rather unusual manner in front of a large group of people but that's not enough to compensate for the other shortcomings in this one. I would suggest watching it before buying; the dedicated fan may want to add this one to their collection for the sake of completeness but watching it first is my recommendation.",1330819200,,720,4.669291338582677
