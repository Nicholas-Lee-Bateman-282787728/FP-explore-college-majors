8495985,5,B006B894UW,I found this show on the EndemolShineInternational station on my Roku device. I enjoyed the storylines of angels battling their personal conflicts while helping others as lawyers. I thought there would be more darker scences with a fallen angel lurking around the courtroom.,1525910400,,274,5.395348837209302

8495989,2,B006B894UW,"There's some pretty significant talent squandered here but I guess the B-list cast of Game of Thrones has to pay the rent between series somehow. Tobias Menzies, you played Brutus... what are you doing in this dreck? Stephen Dillane, I hope you got yourself something really nice. You deserve it.

The fundamental problem is that the story is ridiculous. ""Mr Mountjoy"" (i.e. God) wants humans to have free will but then threatens the entire universe with Armageddon because human are using their free will in a way ""he"" doesn't approve of. In what sense then is it free will? He wants people to make their own choices but then sends angels to ""advise"" them on the strict condition that they not interfere (since somehow advising isn't interfering) and then punishes the angels for helping people because that's not what he sent them there to do. He sent them to watch, no aid, no not aid, assist, no not intervene, etc. For some reason, he doesn't just tell the angels what he wants; he throws troubled souls their way and makes them figure out what he's after. And then punishes them for taking any action to achieve it. The most plausible aspect of the story is that so many angels are packing it in and joining the dark side.

Angels have lived for billions of years in the presence of an omniscient deity ""observing"" humans but somehow still have things to learn from them in 2015 like what true love is (apparently a recent development and something forbidden to angels for no obvious reason except to set up  star-crossed lover plots).

There's a fallen angel who has it in for the good angel and the culmination of a series worth of antagonism is basically a fist fight because they blew the whole budget on cheesy pop-up wing special effects inserted at apparently random moments.

Honestly The Adventures of Merlin has a more believable, interesting and internally consistent mythos.",1449792000,,1892,4.773700305810397
