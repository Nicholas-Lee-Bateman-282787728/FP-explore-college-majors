8477105,5,B005KQ8O8O,"These black & white 1950s BBC recordings of Margot Fonteyn partnered by Michael Somes of England's Sadlers Wells (later Royal) Ballet are recently reissued, priceless documentation of the ballet legend that is Fonteyn.  Younger and more curvaceous than in her later famous partnership with Rudolf Nureyev, Fonteyn dances beautifully as Aurora in Sleeping Beauty (this is a different performance than the full SB 1955 film by VAI on DVD) in lovely small tiaras and shorter tutus, and includes her best Rose Adagio sequence on film;  both parts of Odette and Odile in Swan Lake (including Act III where as the black swan Odile she performs the difficult 32 fouettes/spins in place), and a dramatic and lovely Sugar Plum Fairy in the Nutcracker, where you get to see her fine acting skills emoting with the character of Clara the young girl, with many close-ups of her beautiful face.  These '50s performance clips are real treasures for any Fonteyn fan or admirer, and there is another one in this BBC series on DVD, Les Sylphides/Coppelia/Giselle with Nadia Nerina, which has a 1962 partial performance of Fonteyn with a just-defected young Rudolf Nureyev in the last act of Giselle, which is another example of true ballet artistry and beginning of their own legend - I saw them in a performance of Marguerite & Armand at the Met in NYC in the mid-'70s near the end of her career, she was magical even then and it's wonderful to be able to see these younger performances.",1365638400,4,1471,4.852589641434263
8477106,4,B005KQ8O8O,"Tchaikovsky: Ballet Masterpieces, starring Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes, along with the Sadler's Wells Ballet, show us Fonteyn's first amazing partnership in ballet, as well as the foundations of the future Royal Ballet. These excerpts are legendary historical artifacts, and it is so great that those interested in the history of ballet can now access these rare artifacts. Sleeping Beauty particularly appealed to me, especially with Fonteyn's elegance and grace, that was assessable without her having to lift her leg to 300. Of course, her technical proficiency wasn't as excellent as when it was with Nureyev, but it is still quite a sight to see. I recommend this to all fans of ballet, especially as a historical artifact.",1325980800,,733,5.220338983050848
8477107,4,B005KQ8O8O,"This is a must-have DVD for all balletomanes. Fonteyn is so young, fresh, and delightful in these extracts! While her dynamic poise and unforgettable artistry is not as piqued here as in her later work with Nureyev, both old and new Margot fans will find a whole new dimension of her in this recording. The snippets are delightful, and show a good range of her classical roles. I find Fonteyn most interesting and captivating as Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty; from the moment she steps on stage, one cannot take their eyes off of her. She's bright, bubbly, energetic, and dynamic, filling every tiny movement with effervescent energy. Regardless, the entire DVD is lovely, and while I cannot claim to be the biggest fan of Michael Somes, he presents well as Margot's erstwhile partner.",1323475200,3,790,4.902985074626866
