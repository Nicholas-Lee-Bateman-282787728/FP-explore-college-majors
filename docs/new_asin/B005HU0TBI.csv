4705361,5,B005HU0TBI,"My wife is 'huge, huge' fan of the show and can watch a whole season in just a few days (I can take the show or leave it). I have made it a point to get her a new release whenever they were made available. Some of the seasons we purchased have been on DVD and others on Amazon's download service through our blue-ray player.

With the long delay in releasing seasons 9 through 13 and season 15, it seemed that a complete series release was coming, especially with the successful retailing of other complete series releases like ""The Sopranos"", etc.

Like many, we have already purchased all the available seasons; however, to be done with the waiting and purchasing of individual seasons, we will likely sell the seasons we have at a very reduced price and put the money toward the complete series.

The price is reasonable since we paid between $35 and $45 for each season we own. With six individual seasons remaining, that would equal another $180 -  $270 just to complete the series. Add that to fact all will be on one type of media makes this a good purchase for a Christmas present.",1315094400,3,1089,4.484848484848484
4705362,5,B005HU0TBI,"True, this collection is probably just for the hardcore L&O fans, but it's still a great price per episode.  Plus, if they do it right, it will just be one box full of discs -- high on content, low on wasteful cardboard packaging :-)

This time next year, the price will probably be a whole lot lower, but don't wait too long, cuz once it's discontinued, $490 will look like a steal.",1314835200,7,383,4.305555555555555
4705363,5,B005HU0TBI,I have been waiting for so long to complete the set of LAW & ORDER and I am glad for the set but if they came out one season at a time I still would be more than satisfied,1313884800,7,171,3.41025641025641
4705364,5,B005HU0TBI,"Wait till christmas youll see the price come down 50%.But then again Maybe I wrong,Maybe It will take a lot longer. But I garentee you It will come down,atleast 50%.Take a look at the hunter dvd (the complete series of hunter)Last year at this time they released it for $100.00 the other day they had it marked down to 70% off which was around $29.99 so give it time it will come down.",1313884800,11,385,4.287671232876712
4705365,5,B005HU0TBI,"I don't even watch this show, but this is a very reasonable price. Stop complaining. I buy a lot of TV on DVD, and I try to spend around $1 an episode when I can, which is really cheap. Most seasons retail at $40-$50, and Amazon's offering 20 seasons at just under $25 a season. It's like 450 some odd episodes for $490. It's definitely a lot of money, but it's also a lot of television. I'm sure it will drop in price even further just like Seinfeld did after a couple years, but even so, this is an amazing release price.",1313884800,11,523,4.137254901960785

4705369,5,B005HU0TBI,"OMG!!!!!!! I have loved this show since I was probably five years old. Of course, when I was that age, I never actually watched it, but I fell in love with the theme music. I've been watching it since I was a teenager, never saw any of them in order, but now I will!!!!

There is nothing like the original Law & Order. The spin-offs, to me, can't touch this!! Briscoe & Logan were my favorite detectives, absolutely dynamic. Assistant DA Stone & Robinette, wonderful characters..... Jack & Claire, the perfect justice duo. Obviously, I'm still watching the first few seasons, but it's unbelievably great!!

If you love Law & Order, then you MUST watch it from the beginning. Learn how it all got started. Learn why it was and will forever be the best crime show in television history!!!",1499212800,2,786,4.607142857142857

4705374,4,B005HU0TBI,REALLY ENJOYED.,1494720000,,15,7.0
4705375,5,B005HU0TBI,"Law & Order was a great series that ran from 1990 to 2010. The box set contains all 456 episodes (about 350 hours) of the series. Seasons 1-4 are rarely shown on TV today because they were filmed in the old 4 X 3 ratio, and are in that ratio (with black bars on the sides when shown on a widescreen TV) in the box set. Seasons 5-13 and 15-20 were filmed in widescreen and are presented in widescreen in the set. Season 14 was filmed in widescreen, but for reasons unknown is presented on DVD in the 4 X 3 ratio.

The characters vary throughout the years of the episodes, and you may be surprised at the characters particularly in the early seasons. An episode guide is included with the set, but it just lists the episodes by season with a sentence or two about each episode.

The DVDs come in a sturdy cardboard box. Each season is presented in a multi-DVD case with 6 DVDs. As is usual with multi-DVD cases, the discs frequently slip out of their holders.

I have bought literally hundreds of DVDs from Amazon, but I bought this set elsewhere. I suggest that you do an internet search for the product before deciding where to buy it.",1494288000,4,1135,4.31924882629108

4705378,5,B005HU0TBI,"This is, simply, one of the greatest series in the history of television.  It may be formulaic, but it's a formula that worked for 20 seasons. The detective side of the show was gritty and realistic enough to make you sympathize with the job they had to do and the prosecutor side of the story showed the complexity attorneys have to deal with when trying to prosecute a case and sort out often conflicting facts.  Great casting occurs throughout, with many famous faces getting early career appearances on the show.",1489104000,7,516,4.722222222222222

Wow! What a NICE set! Great price! It comes out to about 15 dollars a season which is very reasonable. I never realized how many seasons this show ran. Some predate wide screen TV's! Wow.

4705398,5,B005HU0TBI,"Am ""binge watching"" the original ""Law & Order"" -- 450 episodes (correct) about 350 hours spread over the 20 seasons. The box set was briefly available in 2013 but (often) not available for sale at Amazon. I got my box set for a couple hundred U.S. dollars (a fantastic bargain for 20 years worth of the series) from a private seller in Colorado. We finish one episode, and my wife Irene says ""Oh, put on another one!"" Our record is 12 episodes in two days. We've settled back into . . . oh, four a day. Best dramatic television -- best writing, best characterization -- in the history of TV. I wondered if it would ""stand up"" -- not be dated. Instead, it's even better than I remembered it: After each one ends, I keep saying the same thing: ""That's the best one yet! No really!"" (Personal recommendation: Start with Season Four. By then they'd settled into their perfect format that would survive each new change of characters.

Good Friday post script:

At the end of Season 14, my wife's favorite character (mine too after getting to know him for 10 years worth of episodes) ""Lenny Briscoe"" leaves the show; his belongings in a box, as he says goodbye to his fellow detectives.

My wife despaired of Lenny being successfully replaced by any other actor. And at first, in Season 15 she didn't like Detective Joe Fontana (for the same reason his boss, Lieut. Van Buren doesn't -- his ""attitude""). But then actor Dennis Farina works his own magic -- bringing such 'gravitas,' as the Latins say, to his performance.

A moment ago my wife and I watched what we both agreed to be the ""best episode yet."" Season 16, episode three, Disc 1, titled: ""Ghosts"" it is described in the considerable Wiki entry for ""Detective Joe Fontana"" (not the actor who portrays him, Dennis Farina!):

""In 1995, Fontana started a two-year investigation into the murder of 12-year-old Sara Dolan. Convinced that her father was involved, Fontana does not let go of the case until another murderer confesses to the crime. Fontana questioned his original judgment after extensive investigation, leading to the actual killer being convicted after Mr. Dolan testifies in court. Publicly, Fontana claimed to have no regrets about his original belief in Mr. Dolan's guilt because it was reasonable in light of the facts he had during the original investigation. He later visited Mr. Dolan and tries to apologize only to be turned away.""

At that moment, when Dolan opens his front door and Fontana offers his hand and an apology, my wife said, ""He'll shake it."" He did not. Then we both said, in unison, ""He (Det. Fontana) still did the right thing"" seeking forgiveness.

----

June 3 post script.  Well it took six months, sometimes watching four or five episodes a day!  But all good things must come to an end: My wife Irene and I just watched the very last episode of Season 20. We felt a little anxious when we put on that final track on the DVD, wondering how on earth the producers could come up with a final episode worthy of the 20 seasons of greatness this dramatic gem had provided. Well, suffice to say it was perfect. Note perfect. We were reduced to tears. Of joy. (Always the best kind, right?)",1453420800,4,3177,4.6571428571428575

4705417,5,B005HU0TBI,"Law and Order shares with Gun smoke for the title of longest-running prime-time TV drama.
For 20 years, their combination of writing, acting and production values kept them on national TV.
TV Guide, in 2013, ranked the show #14 in a list of the 60 greatest shows of all time.
While the show is available as reruns, they are not shown in any sequence or keeping the seasons together.
This results in a jumbled main story line, with little to no logical base.
Often smaller stations do not stay on schedule and this will chop the ending.
The later seasons are only available on DVD in this set.
Additionally, some of the individual season sets are slim line, meaning the DVDs are two-sided with almost no guide to where an episode is.
This set is five or six DVDs per season with a full color illustrated guide listing the episodes with trivia tidbits.

Be prepared to be impressed!
The 104 discs need a large box and do have some weight to them.
The discs are in a season clamshell box and the whole is in a flip top box.
We store the series box in a bookcase, keeping the year we are watching near the TV.
To get an idea of the 20,718 minutes contained in the set, that is 345 hours or 14 days.
If my wife and I watch three episodes a night, we have 173 nights of viewing.
Since the show is so good, we could start over at season one the next night.",1413590400,,1349,4.249027237354086

Law & Order stands at the top of the heap for crime drama set in New York. And it's probably the only long-running series that managed to maintain its edge over the years. The cast changes, great writing, and ripped-from-the headlines plots set it apart from its imitators. Filmed on location in New York, L&O was a showcase for tons of Broadway actors, including stars like Patti Lupone and Andre De Shields. It's also great to see future star actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Philip Seymour Hoffman in their early years featured as guests. This is an excellent award-winning series, and it's packaged like an iconic series should be packaged, like a family heirloom.

4705433,5,B005HU0TBI,"Law And Order will always be to me the perfect example of how to get it all perfect in a cop/courtroom TV drama.  The real difference in this series that continuously set it apart from any other cop drama is very simple.  It totally dispensed with all of the personal drama and romantic bulls**t.  For the most part, the personal lives and loves of all the characters over the years was totally ignored, and never became much of a factor.  Oh throughout the series there was some moments here and there where it broke out of its mold for a while.  Lenny's distant relationship with his daughter, detective Logan's early on unfaithfulness, Van Buren's cancer, etc.  But in all cases they became barely mentioned or emphasized subplots that really did nothing to cease the ever fast moving investigation by the various detectives, and the prosecutors office.  And this is also one of those series that pretty much was left unaffected by the changes over the years with the detectives and lawyers.  We may have had a favorite here and there, (especially Jerry Orbach that lasted almost to the very end and was terrific), but since they never messed with the original formula it never made a whole lot of difference.  It remained right up to the very end the quintessential cop drama.  In fact, the only reason I see that it got canceled after 20 years was not due to its changing or becoming inferior in any way, but just that it unfortunately got lost in the new, (and simply horrible) appetite of reality TV that is like a cancer destroying everything that was once truly funny, or escapist in family entertainment on television.  It just couldn't survive as filet mignon with the overindulgence of meat filler grease burgers that passes for entertainment these days...

Though L&O is easily available in most markets in reruns, this full series is still the way to go.  Not only do most affiliates that carry this buy a specified block of seasons that get repeated over and over, (like Gunsmoke and Bonanza or any other long running classics), but they also have edited, in some cases quite heavily most of the episodes to make room for more commercials.  Something even I didn't notice too much until I got this set and started playing some of my favorite episodes.  This series may carry a hefty price tag, but you will not spend a more practical and entertaining dollar on a TV series that was any better in my opinion.  I am so happy I have finally sprung  for it, and I highly recommend if you love this show that you do as well.. : )",1393200000,,2539,4.6066666666666665

I agree with them for the most part. But still, the low quality of several of these disc transfers, I think, should properly reflect at least one star lower to warn buyers. I admit if these discs were all superb the set would in arguably garner 5 stars by anyone remotely interested in the show. These shows are among the greatest in the history of tv. They only need to be handled with the utmost of care as if they were treasures (which they are!).  But I will also lower one star for the price and one for the poor packaging and one b/c some of the discs do not play who can watch them all before the return date expires, They should allow consumers 2 years to return this set if they find any disc not working or at least replace it watch from the check all your dvds when u get it make sure they all play.  The show itself is five stars.  You could have bought this complete set on black Friday 2012 at best buy for $409.99 at Target for $414.98 and at Walmart or Costco for $419.95. I don't understand why they sell things so high the rest of the year.  I got my complete set for $425.33 with taxes.  The price should be below $430 because you should be getting a discount for buying them all at once.  It's actually cheaper to watch via streaming them. The packaging is cheap and made in china of cardboard.  5 star tv show but due to price packaging and transfer quality and damaged dvd's, i'm reducing a star. Also be aware they may release the complete set of law and order along with law and order: SVU and criminal intent, in one large deluxe edition with a tin packaging for $509.99 or the digital download for $289.99 in the fall of 2021.

4705466,5,B005HU0TBI,"I just recieved my Law & Order mega boxset-what can I say but...WOW!!! Before I discuss the dvd, I'd like to comment on the seller. I bought this item used from Buy_The_Book. The item arrived in 7 days(Great so far!) The item's condition was described by them as brand new with a slight damage (a slim cut) on the barcode. The boxset arrived brand new in it's orginal plastic, in near mint condition, and the damaged barcode was almost unnoticeable. And unless you're planning on reselling this item, a slightly damaged barcode means virtually nothing. And besides, who in their right mind would buy this stunningly beautiful boxset at the prices it's offered at, just to resell it later? And as icing on the seller's cake, they offered it at the almost unheard of price of $350.00 (The same seller is currently offering this boxset in the exact same condition for $472.00-looks like I bought mine just in the nick of time!) And the dvd was sent carefully and meticulously packaged to protect against damage during shipping. Add up all these factors, and this seller could easily sell ice cubes to an eskimo!
  Now for the dvd-where was I again? Oh yeah-WOW!!!! I've been a huge fan of this tv show almost from the very beginning. It's easily the 2nd best crime/courtroom drama ever made, 2nd only to Perry Mason (The original b/w episodes). What I've always liked so much about Law & Order was it's documentary like feel and the excelent writing and acting. But what I really liked most about the show was that the prosecuters (The Good Guys) DIDN'T ALWAYS WIN!!! This gave the show a true sense of realism that many other popular crime shows (like NCIS) just don't have.
  I'm so glad Universal decided to release all 20 seasons in one massive beautiful boxset. It's great (and comforting) to know you have every season of your favorite show at your fingertips and available to watch whenever you want, as opposed to collecting a single season every year. I wish Paramount would do the same with Gunsmoke, instead of releasing it in those oh so annoying (and ridiculously high-priced) half season sets.
  All in all, if you're a fan of Law & Order, then you NEED to get this wonderfully packaged megaset- it's a lovingly mounted tribute to a show that, 50 years from now, will be regarded as much a classic as shows like Perry Mason, The Untouchables, Hawaii 5-O and others. Believe me, you'll never regret the purchase!",1337904000,66,2422,4.7004716981132075
4705467,5,B005HU0TBI,"...""they ain't no sech animule"".

One factor of how this series lasted 20 years--it's STORY-BASED rather than CHARACTER-BASED. There was nobody in the first season cast that was still in the cast come the last season. This is the polar opposite of the way ""Two and a Half Men"" had to bring in pinch hitter Ashton Kutcher to replace the spoiled ne'er-do-well Charlie Sheen and all of the fans who admire his ""screw you"" mentality are still screaming bloody murder like Sheen was the persecuted slacker equivalent of Mahatma Ghandi; ""Death to Kutcher--Charlie RULES. Dude, I will NEVER NEVER NEVER watch the series again"".

There was never a chance of that in ""Law & Order"" (which my stoner brother calls ""that bleepin' COP show""). ""L&O"" has always been about the CASES, which Dick Wolf often based on real-life crime. So he cast the series with brilliant character actors who were into acting rather than ego, who had talent rather than cults of personality. Noth, Dzundza, Moriarty down the line to Merkerson, Waterson, Orbach and beyond. A statuesque brunette with a husky voice named Jill Hennessy. A guy named Garrett Wong who was so believable as a forensic psychologist on this series that he bagged a gig as a cop shrink on a more recent series. This series had me pausing at every piano I saw and picking out the first two bars of the theme. I've had that theme as a ringtone on most cell phones I've owned. Somebody would ask me who was in the latest ""L&O"" that week and I would say ""hell, I don't know, but the story was dynamite"". Because it didn't mean jack squat who starred--the story was the whole ball of wax. Dick Wolf became the Rod Serling of crime stories in creating this series.

I should have anticipated that this series would be done on dual-layer discs where there were 5 episodea on a disc rather than 4. I bought a different box set recently which stuck to single-layer and as a result my player won't scan that 5th episode. No problem with that here due to the dual-layer discs used. My thanks to the customer who included a warning in his review about one disc not being included in his set because somebody at the plant goofed and substituted a duplicate of another disc. That fortunately didn't happen to me, but I made sure I went through them all. In this series there are a few crossover episodes where the other half of the story was on ""Homicide: Life On the Street"", and we get that part as well in this set. Unfortunately there was also a crossover with ""Special Victims Unit"" and we don't get the other half of that. Bummer.

But whatever you do, DON'T treat yourself to one-day shipping out of eagerness to hold it in your two hands after setting VCRs (and later on DVRs) for it for a whole generation. I tried it just this once and ERRRNGH! Wrong answer. Due to a delay, the package didn't even leave the warehouse until early afternoon on what was supposed to be its ""estimated arrival"" here. I really shouldn't have chosen that shipping rate unless I'd known Amazon had a shipping center somewhere right here in Florida--Georgia at the furthest. I highly recommend the series. I DON'T recommend being in such a hurry that you NEED shipping shortcuts.",1337299200,2,3193,4.606326889279438

With over 400 episodes the quality of the stories and the acting are really amazing. The sheer volume of entertainment this complete series offers makes it worth every penny in my view. Watching a couple episodes a night, I am still not all the way thru the full 20 seasons!

I love this item and am quite happy with the overall product.  One drawback is the quality of the case.  I think in order to hold 20 dvd cases, which contain 5-6 dvds each, the case could have been constructed better, maybe out of plastic rather than cardboard.  Also, with 20 seasons of an iconic t.v. drama, I think the booklet that was included could have been more robust.  Perhaps it could have offered some of the back story of how the drama was created and information on the cast and filming and writing, etc.  It simply offers a very brief description of each episode.  Why not include the names of the guest stars?  As I said, I am a huge L&O fan so I'm thrilled to have all 20 seasons but for the very hefty price, I think so much more could have been offered.",1325721600,8,923,4.228571428571429

Obviously $450 is a lot, but let's look at how much it would cost if I continue to buy each season individually: $40 x 20 seasons = $800. So this boxed set is basically 50% off of what a grand total would be. Also amazon now offers a trade-in program, so I just sent back those 9 seasons and got a nice little gift card amounting to around $80. The price will vary depending on DVD conditions. While the trade-in values aren't near what I originally paid, it's still a better price than just letting them sit around and having two copies of the first eight years.",1324857600,5,752,4.157534246575342

I also recomend you pick up a copy of ""a law and order movie EXILED"" if you can find a copy (i found a irish region 0 copy for about $15.00) it stars chris noth and ice-t,it explains what happens to logan between law and order and criminal intent, it also shows fins (ice-t) begining before s.v.u.",1323820800,3,591,4.147826086956521
4705478,4,B005HU0TBI,"How about a quick review on the product, rather than the cost, wouldn't that be refreshing?

As the title states, Law & Order is a fantastic series.  I was unhappy to hear that it had finally been cancelled, but once word got out that this box set would be released before Christmas, it lessened the pain a bit.  I was a huge fan of nearly all casts - particularly those appearing in the first four seasons.

Captions always make me happy, & all seasons include English.  Spanish subtitles are available on seasons one - eight & fourteen, seasons previously released.  French subtitles are found on a few of these as well.

What I found surprising, & rather disappointing, is that the only Special Features/Extras in the entire 20 seasons are found in the previously released seasons.  Seasons nine - thirteen & fifteen - twenty include only the episodes.  To my knowledge there isn't a requirement for this sort of thing, but for a show with 20 YEARS under its belt, I couldn't help but shake my head.

Enjoy your 450+ episodes!  I know I am!",1321920000,32,1043,4.583783783783784
4705479,3,B005HU0TBI,"Does anyone know if Exiled: A Law and Order Movie is included in the box set?  I think that it would be disappointing and not quite ""complete"" if not included.",1321228800,4,159,4.3
4705480,5,B005HU0TBI,"I pre-ordered this DVD BoxSet as soon as I heard about it's release-approx. 1 month b/f the release date of November 8th (yesyerday). I've purchased all of the ""L & O"" Season Sets since they began being released in 2002. Up to this point, Seasons 1 theough 8 & Season 14 have been put out. I've read some reviews that were a bit negative regarding this ""Complete Series"" DVD Set, due to the fact that many Seasons would have to be re-purchased. However, for a fan like myself-a fan that would have bought ALL of the Season DVD Sets-buying ""The Complete Series"" 20-Season BoxSet for the reasonable price of $450.00 would SAVE me $. & as an added bonus, all of the 20 Seasons are @ my disposal @ once! No more waiting for Universal to release individual Seasons once or twice/year! Now onto the DVD Set itself....1 of the most beautiful & handsome looking DVD Sets that I've ever seen (& DVD collecting is 1 of my biggest hobbies). Each Season is packaged in a 'tray-stack' 5 or 6 disc set, w/ amazing cover artwork! Also, there is a wonderful 46 page Episode Guide Book, all in full color, & printed on heavy-duty, high-gloss quality paper! It is the perfect guide for the DVD Set. Each Season has 2 pages w/ episode synopsis & great photos from the entire run of the show-giving the owner a guide as to what episodes are on what disc, per Season! The picture & sound quality are amazing, & speaking for the 9 Seasons that have already been released (1 through 8 & 14), the pic/sound quality is even better. Seasons 1 through 4 are Full-Screen, & 5 through 20 are Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1 Ratio). I conclude by making this point-for those who think that this is too much $ to shell out @ 1 time--if you plan on buying all of the ""L & O"" Seasons eventually, you will save a lot of $ by buying this Set, you won't have to wait to own your favorite newer Seasons, & you'll have a beautiful & exclusive book w/an awesome & beautiful BoxSet that a show like ""L & O"" deserves! This is what will seperate the real fans from the fair-weatherd!",1320796800,123,2039,4.382585751978892
4705481,5,B005HU0TBI,"Yes I don't own the complete series. But yes, I would once the sellers drops it to a reasonable price. Somewhere in the $200-250 range sounds appropriate for me and trust me, Amazon will have it there within 6-12 months of this release.",1319500800,3,236,4.511627906976744
4705482,5,B005HU0TBI,"I am a HUGE fan of the show- and I hope that someone does buy the complete series,  breaks up the box set and sells each season individually.

4705483,5,B005HU0TBI,Dropping this $500 bill on consumers of this box set after half the DVDs have been released at $40-$50 a piece - now requiring folks to repurchase these seasons 1-7 DVDs in a box set to obtain the rest of the DVDs seasons 8-20 is consumer robbery.,1317772800,14,247,4.276595744680851
4705484,5,B005HU0TBI,"SHUT UP! All you whining babies who complain about the price need to get a life. First off, when they started releasing them on their own, they had no idea when the series would end so those whining that NBC cheated you by releasing half the series them slamming you witha  series box set need to shut it. Would you rather NBC waited until the show was doen before any episodes hit DVD? As for the 10 seasons you may own, sell them on Ebay or Amazon, give them to a friend, or just keep them. Secondly, $450 bucks for 20 seasons, 456 episodes on 104 DVDs is a STEAL! Would you rather buy each season for $50 and not get this cool collection? Finally, just stop whining. If you don't like the price then don't buy it. But since I consider L&O to be the greatest show ever made, I will gladdy put up $500 or even more. The chance to own all 20 landmark seasons is good enough for me. Those of you who whine, aren't real fans I guess.",1317340800,19,931,4.115384615384615

4705486,2,B005HU0TBI,"Why is it that the networks and studios who produce, and distribute these television series have no concern for the people who buy them ?
Allow me to explain, they lure you in with individual season releases, and then after about half the seasons are already out on DVD, they slam you with the ""full series"" boxed sets, thus making you spend even more money on episodes you most likely already have.
I love Law & Order, but I already own several seasons, and I can't see spending this much money re-buying seasons I already own.
Why do these production companys' and studios care so little for their customers ?",1316044800,76,611,4.5636363636363635
4705487,3,B005HU0TBI,"Well as it stands right now in late September 2011 the price is $490. Now that works out to $24.5 a season. Not bad but a lot of the ones that are already out go on sale at Best Buy and Barnes & Noble for around $10. Not to mention they are ALWAYS on cable. It's a lot of money in this economy to spend at once.

Secondly, all seasons from 5 onward were filmed in widescreen for HDTVs. Season 14 will NOT be the HDTV airings, but the DVDs that came out at the time, cropped to a 'full screen' ratio, which won't even look right since most people have widescreen TVs now.",1315958400,79,570,4.0
