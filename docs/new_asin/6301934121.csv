380399,2,6301934121,"Oh how I wish I didn't read only the 4-5 star  reviews before purchasing.
I like thriller type movies from Australia. The acting is ok, the plot is ok but the actual story line is not a thriller, horror, suspense nor exciting. It's ""blah"". Wait until it comes back to HBO and you will see that ""blah"" is sufficient.

Oh how I wish it didn't have only Spanish subtitles. Some words I didn't pick up. I could be me but I think its them.",1474416000,,434,4.154761904761905

380401,4,6301934121,"Made for a TV audience in 1985 this is one of those films that needs wider attention. The plot is quite simple in that a small Outback school where only nine children of varying ages attend is overseen by an English school teacher. This is Sally Jones played by Rachel Ward (On The Beach and Against All Odds). Then in the middle of a normal school day four masked gunmen turn up and kidnap them.

Once they are secreted in the bush they soon realise that these guys are not going to win any prizes for being nice. So they decide to escape, but things are never quite straight forward and events take a different turn when they realise they cant run any more.

Now to say this is a little beaut is putting it mildly. The children are all excellent especially Sean Garlick as Sid who went on to be in Home and Away. It has the right pacing the right levels of tension and a rip roaring adventure into the bargain. This is one that if you have missed it then you have a real treat waiting for you in this superb production.",1458086400,,1021,4.230769230769231

The other day I was daydreaming and the scene where Rachael Ward swims underwater to find a way out of their entrapment popped into my head and I got on Google to try to find out what the name of the film was because I couldn't remember the title.

380486,1,6301934121,"Nothing Like Reality.

Stunk.

CGi for the sake of cgi.

No story.

No characters.

Actors look totally confused and uncomfortable. Funniest scene is this jerko ""actor"" shaving with a Giletter Safety Razor---and has NO freeking idea how to even use it.

The whole movie is that way

I can NOT believe how freeking BAD it is.

No feelings like I had watching ""12 O'Clock High,"" perhaps one of the best WWii movies ever made, and certainly one othe best movies ever made.

How hard is it to capture the claustrophobic interior of a ""Fortress""? I have been in them---it's tight as a coffin. My uncle flew them for real in WWii and never should have lived but he did.

If you're a Millenial or younger you will LOVE THIS POS, because you were raised on garbage

Speedy Delivery!

And before you criticize me---WE, my generation, not yours---we invented space travel, computers, calculators, video games, cell-phones, and all the rest---not you.

And WE, span the space age and the Age of WWii, which looks to me more like science fiction than your Brave New World can EVER hope to ****ing match.

Am I pissed off at you? Yes, for wanting to just get by and along rather than live in the freeking bear-trap of reality.

No matter...soon enough, your hitherto silly decisions will come to be centered on survival, and the ring will complete itself once more, as it always does.

CHOW! And Shebat Shalom M*********ers!

380628,5,6301934121,"While at first I thought this might be a typical kids' Saturday Matinee film, I quickly saw that it had some more-or-less adult content or certainly PG-13 stuff: gory murder scenes and some almost racy shots of Rachel Ward and Rebecca Rigg in a swimming scene. While Rebecca plays a nubile young teenager, she actually was 19 when she made the film, so there was no ""exploitation"" of a child there.  I found the film entertaining on a couple of levels with some clever twists and turns. I think it is well acted and well plotted. There's some cool ""new Age"" kind of music, particularly at the end. Overall, I really enjoyed the film as a fine piece for an evening of ""escape.""

The script goes beyond telegraphing every future development -- it practically uses semaphore flags. Also, it focuses on plot situations to the near-total exclusion of character development. Frankly, it's just weak. This DVD offers no special features worth mentioning.

If you happen to see this coming along on cable TV some night, and you've got nothing better to do and no laundry to wash, it'd be worth wasting an hour and a half on. But it's just not worth spending your money on.",1365206400,,614,4.903846153846154

It all starts mundane enough, with a teacher and students in a one-room schoolhouse in Australia. Everybody does the things teachers and students do normally until the bad guys arrive and the rug is pulled out from everyday life.

As the scenes and situations shift and change, so do the roles and hierarchy of the teacher and students. The last part of the movie, when the teacher and students are involved with police is unnerving and heartwarming and horrible and satisfying all at the same time.

This movie shows many of the primal and tribal things that are part of the human past and present and the resourcefulness and ferocity that can arise in people chosen as victims.

It's left up to us to figure out what we just viewed. We don't even know whether the children are psychologically scarred for life by what's happened to them and what they've done as a consequence.

Thought-provoking on many levels, with a feeling of reality that hits home. History and even the daily news shows us that people are capable of things that seem improbable if not impossible. It's not hard to believe the premise of this movie.",1274745600,3,1315,4.578723404255319

This movie perfectly captures a slice of the 80's.  It has a rather dark theme and mood to it but at the same time an element of nostalgia.  The music is done with synthesizers and captures the mood beautifully.  The quality of the film has that mid 80's look to it and the lighting shades are quite interesting as well.

The story is simple yet exciting when your a kid.  When your an adult watching it again it is all about remembering what you think your gonna remember and of coarse you do!

380684,5,6301934121,"I was one of the people who saw this movie back on HBO in the 1980s and I was very thankful that I video recorded it as well onto my VHS tape, so I can watch it any time.

This movie also scared the heck out of me too when I was younger.  The music is very creepy, especially right before the gunmen come out into play and the looks of horror and shock on the childrens' faces in that classroom are something you will never forget.

Sean Garlick and Rebecca Rigg (I think was her name) were the eldest children out of the group.  Their performances were very good.

I really thought it was ingenious how they did get out of the cave too.  That was very ingenious.  I also loved seeing the Kangaroos too.  They were so beautiful!

I, too, agree how they used their school supplies was quite neat and interesting.  I really did think it was a good movie.

One scene I will never forget though was when one of the gunmen (Dabby Duck) got his.  That was terrifying.

Something that puzzled me was the fact that the second oldest boy (the heavier one) is credited with two names in the credits... so I am unsure which exact character he played.  Didn't make sense to me back then and really doesn't make sense to me now that I am older.

Something interesting to notice though when you watch the video... at the end of the movie in the classroom where she is looking at the jar (not going to give anymore specifics) when the cave starts to form, it forms the shape of a heart.  Really cool graphics on that one I might add.  You have to really pay attention to notice it.

Yes, it does teach the kids revenge.  However, after all the trauma that they went through, it was their only way to survive if they wanted to come out alive.

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.  Sean has done tremendous things with his life since the movie back in the 80s.  He's around my age and he still looks great!

As far as the other actors, besides Rachel, I have no idea what they have done with their lives over the years.

Great movie - 5 star review from me.  Makes me want to go and put it into the VHS player right now actually.  LOL!",1248134400,,2133,4.204938271604938
380685,5,6301934121,"I saw this movie in 1985 or 86 when I was 7 years old. I only saw it one time on TV. I didn't even remember how I came to see it or whose home I saw this movie in. I didn't remember the title. I remembered that it scared the crap out of me and gave me recurring nightmares over the years from the first night I saw it up to this day.  I just ordered this movie and plan to watch it a second time, since the first time I saw it 24 years ago, and try to understand how this movie affected me in such a deep way.
UPDATE: I finally saw the movie. It is everything I'd imagined it; very thrilling from beginning to end. Among many things three things made this movie excellent; the acting, sound effects  and pacing. There is realistic acting from the entire cast, even the youngest of the children are very charismatic and believable. The sound effects is actually what makes this movie creepy. Most horror movies are loud and jarring from start to end. Fortress starts out silent then gets loud and silent and then loud again, etc... It creates a three dimensional aural suspense that makes a sunny day in the Australian outback as creepy and horrifying as a rainy night in a haunted castle in Transylvania (IE. See the similarly styled setting of the Mad Max movie). See it for the sound if anything. The pacing is spectacular. An actual story is being told and as an audience you get treated with respect by the storyteller. Nothing is wasteful or meaningless. The plot is tight and compact, the themes precise and grotesque so you get an actual movie and not some loud disposable, cheap music video/pop sensation horror flick.",1239235200,,1626,4.398671096345515

380689,4,6301934121,"In this made for TV film based on a book about a real-life incident, Rachel Ward (The Thorn Birds, Sharky's Machine) plays a teacher in a rural one-room schoolhouse who is, along with her students, kidnapped by psychopathic yahoos.

Ward is prettier than most teachers, but she avoids being too glamorous to be believed in the role. Facing hardships and possible death, she and her students bond through their efforts to survive and escape. The children are the strength of the film--not too cute, but still likeable; not into book learning, but filled with the lore of the Outback.

While the climax may stretch the viewer's credibility, it has a satisfying feel to it, and the final scene of the kids and their teacher safely back in civilization adds a bit of zest to the run-of-the-mill action film.

The group of children and the teacher must now use their smarts to outwit these dangerous kidnappers and many tense moments follow. As i said, not as nail-biting as I remember, but something about the bad guys in those cartoon masks always and still does haunt me, especially the gangs leader, Father Christmas, normally known to these children as the source of all good things Christmas, shown here as being the cruelest, most sinister of all the kidnappers.

380717,4,6301934121,"(3.5/5 stars) ""Fortress"" is a pretty good little movie that sets its suspenseful tone from the opening scene. Although it is loosely based on a true story, its source material is a fictional novel by Gabrielle Lord. Rachel Ward plays Sally Jones, a teacher in a rural, agrarian Australian town. Her classroom is a one room school, combining several age groups in the same room. This aspect of various age groups provides some catalysts for the plot, as the younger children fail to recognize the nature of their situation and the older children bear some of the brunt of responsibility. With no one at the school except Sally and her class, a group of armed, masked men kidnaps them for ransom. Sally and her group are barricaded inside a cave while the men leave to go demand the ransom. The group attempts their escape and eventually stops at a different cave. This is their fortress, which they will stay and attempt to defend from their kidnappers upon their inevitable return. What makes this movie good is the process this group goes through during this terrifying situation. The emotions they express, the actions they take and the age and personality dynamics make for an entertaining watch. They begin the movie emphasizing their differences, then band together during the course of their ordeal. The performances are better than expected, considering some of the young ages and the fact this was made for cable. I didn't find it to be an outstanding movie, though it has stuck with me after watching it. Definitely worth at least one viewing. The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras, though it has two channel stereo and a clean picture.",1159747200,3,1655,4.810526315789474

380719,5,6301934121,"The story of a small classroom that gets kidnapped by a group of men in crazy masks gets crazier and crazier the entire way through.  It is much better than that crappy, newer version that always tricks me when I flip past the guide on cable.

The teacher, Sally, is getting paid roughly a nickel per month, because she has to shack up at the farm house of two of her students' parents.  The farm gets attacked by coyotes - or mutants, I can't remember - and one of the kids, Sidney, has to stay up late TO KILL.  It's foreshadowing people!  His younger brother, Tommy, has a penchant for mutilating dead animals capriciously.  Ahem, foreshadowing.

Anyway, the whole classroom gets abducted, including the fat, moron Derek who teases the little kid, the dumpy chick Norrelle who gets her period half way through the movie, and an assorted cast of other pointless characters.  They all know school house songs and dances, a ton of other useless garbage, and only Sid and Tommy know anything about nature, hiking, swimming, or making a fire.

They get shoved in an underground cave, and their adventure is just beginning.  They find secret caverns and passageways, and have to swim to their freedom.  Sid gets to see his teacher almost naked, which was clearly one of the high-points of a great movie (before she almost swallowed 5 gallons of water).

In the end the kids and the teacher decide to stop running from four douchebags in Halloween masks.  The group makes their stand by setting up traps, pulling night-guard, and preparing for the slaughter.

The climax is awesome, and the brutality knows no end.  All the kids end up emotionally scarred, hating Christmas, afraid of mice, and going to juvie later on in life.

For a review, this movie is a classic.  I can't believe more people don't know about this.  I guess they had good parents :)  The story is crazy.  School kids get kidnapped by guys in freaky masks.  They are forced to kill the kidnappers.  Nothing burns an image into your head like the scene where everyone is roaring and stabbing Father Christmas and they show him blankly staring into space.

I saw it on HBO too and I just remember the ""Father Christmas"" character was really, really creepy.  I saw it AGAIN (I didn't learn my lesson the first time, apparently) about a year later so I was probably 10 or 11 and I watched it all the way through.  My memories now are hazy but I do remember:

1. The older male student reminded me of Justin Bateman and it was probably him for all I know and he saw his teacher nekkid.

2. When the teacher was swimming the little girl out and she panicked and they almost drowned.

3. When they escape and the Father Xmas dude is chasing them and he's screaming and echoing through the woods in that horrible voice.

4. When that dumpy girl hides under the rock in the lee and his legs jump down right in front of her, THAT scared the piss outta me.

5. They build the fortress and turn into little amazons all half dressed and war-painted and they mess Xmas dude UP.

Anyways, that probably had spoilers a plenty, but one reviewer in here was talking about thinking about this movie before he went to bed and that's what made ME think of it, too, when I was driving home the other night.

The children are completely believable in their performances, and there are about a dozen children.

The only flaw in this neatly done movie is a striving after significance at the very end, where the filmmaker tries to turn it into a Lord of the Flies.  But what can you expect?

The plot revolves around a young school teacher and the children of various ages that she teaches in a schoolhouse in Australia. The teacher and the children are kidnapped by men wearing masks who are planning on holding their victims for a hefty ransom and perhaps a little ""fun"" with the teacher and the eldest girl. The movie is suspenseful and full of action as the victims escape from one holding area to another until the end when they take a stand, make a fortress, and take things into their own hands.
Scenes from this movie have stuck with me my whole life. I had nightmares for weeks about the masked bandits coming after me and for awhile I could never look at a Daffy Duck mask the same again. I also vividly remember the students and teacher making a last stand at the old cave where they made their fortress. I was always impressed by how crafty those group of kids were and always hoped I could be as cunning in a similar situation.

That is how amazed you will be when you see this movie, that is, if you see this movie. It was stunning.  I'll spoil it for you because,chances are, you won't get to see it. Or you won't be reading this, thinking it is too long.
The plot is about group of students, all different ages, and a teacher are kidnapped from their one-room school house, by a band of rubber mask wearing killers. They want ransom, of course. They are put under ground and escape underwater. Then they find a nice old couple. The criminals see them and kill the old couple. That is when the group start getting mad, and killing them....
I was fortunate enough to tape this movie and I watched it more times than anyone. Then my father taped over it when I was about 7.
I looked through The cable guide for years and never seeing this movie, or, if I did, It was on so late and I didn't have a timer on my VCR.
I WILL get this movie some how, but I'm not paying that much... for a used copy.
I wish you all can get to see this perfect example of filmmaking.",992390400,3,1157,4.074561403508772

To us, Fortress is a classic thriller that would be perfect to add to our 80's movie collections. PLEASE consider re-releasing this video for us and others who enjoy the suspense of a teacher and her students fearing their lives in the Australian outback.",982800000,2,404,4.5479452054794525

It was absolutely stunning and created all kinds of suspense in my mind. Was the young woman and her students going to die or we're they along for a horrible joy ride? I have been looking for this movie for the 7 or 8 years since I've seen it. Until about 2 weeks ago, a friend has enlightened me with the title of this movie!! I was asking all sorts of people about it and describing all that I had remembered, but didn't even know the title! WELL, IF YOU WANT A GREAT MOVIE TO WATCH, THIS IS THE ONE! I hope to GOD, it gets re-released again....can we email the distributer? What's their name? Thanks......",970012800,21,728,4.0979020979020975

380809,5,6301934121,"I saw this film on HBO in the mideighties and liked it so much, I bought my first VCR just to tape it.  I'm glad to see others like it as well. HBO should rerelease the video. It contains one of Rachel Ward's best  performances, and the boy who helps her defeat the bad guys, whose name is  Sean Garlick, is also excellent.  It has a chilling, ""Lord of the  Flies"" type ending in which the teacher and her charges have to  descend into savagery in order to save themselves from their kidnappers.",962755200,,495,4.268817204301075
380810,5,6301934121,"I originally saw this movie on HBO in the 80's, and been trying to purchase it ever since. Video stores do not carry it, and it is a shame it is not available for purchase.  This is some of the best acting and  suspense ever put on film.  It is realistic and dramatic.  Rachel Ward is  outstanding and the young man who was the eldest male student, protecting  the group was an incredible young lead opposite Ms. Ward. Their relationship  in the movie cannot be descirbed.  True chemistry. This is one of the  movies ever produced. I hope the heads at HBO pictures relize this and  re-release this film.",953683200,2,603,4.4495412844036695

7817055,5,6301934121,I can't believe Amazon had this movie. I saw this movie on t.v. when I was in middle school and have been trying to find it since. That was over twenty years ago. The plot is of a teacher in Australia played by Rachel Ward. The teacher and her students are kidnapped by a gang of masked men. What ensues is a cat and mouse game. This is very suspenseful with a very surprise ending that always gives me chills. This is a rare find. Thank you Amazon!,1499040000,2,449,4.113636363636363
