8425130,2,B004DCB1BS,"How would you feel if the highlights of your favorite show as a child were reduced to 1 DVD per year (as Sesame Street Old School is)? Ok, how would you feel if on this already truncated single DVD is only one full episode with about a dozen selected bits as extras? This is what you are getting with SSOS, Vol 1. Feeling pretty disappointed aren't you...?

The cheap skates at Public Broadcasting & Children's Television Workshop obviously think so little of their fans that this is their idea of a compilation DVD... On the one hand, I loved the trip down memory lane and the ""1969"" episode that is included is the very first episode of Sesame Street, so it's an interesting picture into the beginnings of the show (Gordon #1, Oscar the ORANGE grouch, Big Bird who talks like he is a little demented, Mr. Hooper, and generally all the characters when they were young and exciting, unlike the more recent Sesame Street shows that are tired, rely way too much on Elmo, and don't intellectually challenge the kids). In addition, the extra bits that included are all great, great memory refreshers.

But, and this is a BIG but, how can you release a supposed collection of DVD's that gives you so little? One episode per year???? A dozen or so extra bits per year????? Three of the twelve bits on 1969 are simply actors saying the alphabet. Although it's neat to see Jackie Robinson & James Earl Jones from 37 years ago and this bit was a hallmark of Sesame Street episodes for years, it's hardly my idea of great television to watch someone speak the alphabet dead-pan (especially considering the DVD's are marketed to those of us who watched these shows as children).

These compilations held so much promise. My only hope is that these are teaser DVD's and sometime in the future PBS/CTW will wake up and release larger collections.",1395705600,,1833,4.633846153846154
