5374975,5,B00A1AU6VC,"When I saw this film on TCM ( retitled One for the book) I feel in love with it. I looked all over for the title and was able to locate it through a website that can find any title, even those not out yet.  The film is about Sally, who was just jilted and her friend, Olive who is man crazy. Olive has a date with Bill (Ronald Reagan) and then learns someone else is in town she wants to see more. Sally and Bill then go out for dinner and spend the 3 days together, Sally is afraid to fall in love again. Can Bill change her mind?  One scene that made me giggle is watching Sally get ready for bed. This film is pure fun from start to end, packed with plenty of humor. Well worth seeing. I am glad it's out, under it's original title.",1354406400,11,735,3.9261744966442955
5374976,4,B00A1AU6VC,"This is truly a feel good movie from beginning to end!  If you like Romantic Comedies from the 1940's, this is definitely worth an addition to your personal collection.  Ronald Reagan is terrific as the male lead opposite Eleanor Parker with Eve Arden as comic relief.  Reagan's warm, sunny personality shines through and represents the type of movies he should have made more of during this point in his film career.  Many of his facial reactions (while trying to comprehend Eleanor Parker's thoughts of the moment which always seem to be someplace else!)are reminiscent of the ones he projected during his later, ""other career"".  The film is nothing more than it purports to be and that is just a fun romp that makes you upbeat about yourself and life in general and takes you back to a simpler time...",1352851200,16,804,4.755395683453237
5374977,5,B00A1AU6VC,"Watched it for free on ffilms.org but enjoyed it so much, I'm ordering the DVD. I won't go into the plot because so many reviews have been written about it...and good ones too!. But will say this. Parker was superb as Sally Middleton, Reagan was charming as Bill Page and dear Eve Arden was fantastic as always with her smart aleck remarks and double ententes. If you really just want to sit back and enjoy something, without having to worry about what you and your family are going to hear and see, then this one is for you. Although its not family-oriented, its something perfect to simply enjoy by yourself...or with your turtle dove.",1470096000,,637,4.5964912280701755
5374978,2,B00A1AU6VC,"If you're a Reagan fan then he's almost always worth watching. He Seems the quintessential gentleman. I am all for a romance with a happy ending, especially one that ends in a wedding & I have no problem with old fashioned values. but this plot seemed like it had alot of characters pretending that they weren't doing what they were doing. Reagan seems attracted to any girl, but seems tired of chasing them & getting let down by not getting any action when he's available. This sets him up to be ready to settle down, so he can know that he's guaranteed a girl to come home to during leave & at the end of the war. He seems to find the new girl he meets very refreshing & sweet. Yes, the girl he sparks  seems naive & bubble headed, yet she purposely does everything she can think of to keep Reagan around. Her running around is very obsessive compulsive & manipulative. Kinda creepy & not sweet. She uses tears liberally, knowing the effect they will have, but pretending she can't help it. They both are people looking for meaning & for someone to make them feel special. Yes there IS a happy ending, but consider: they get married, get to be man & wife & then Reagan immediately leaves to return to his war duty. Wow. not really the happy ending for either of them.",1464912000,,1269,4.377118644067797

5374980,4,B00A1AU6VC,"I found this a good film, mainly due to Eve Arden's role. It's not a great movie, but the actors are solid and the theme is interesting. I saw it years ago and it's still one I can watch when bored or the weather is so bad I can't get out. I recommend it for just what it is: a ""fun"" hour or so of gentle humor with a good plot.

I wanted to give it a second chance because I was annoyed by the hammy star actress at first. The second time I watched it, the movie grew on me. It was weird seeing a young Ronald Regan...he was president when I was a little girl. Eve Arden was a treasure, as usual.

5374985,5,B00A1AU6VC,"I bought this one for my mother because I knew she was a big Ronald Reagan fan.  She explained to me that the stage play this was based on was quite the scandal in its day and the film was considered morally objectional in some quarters at the time of its release.  In a day where ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" is considered appropriate Valentines fare I had to check out this allegedly salacious exercise.  Having seen it the film is as harmless as ""Teletubbies"".  The film concerns itself with the growing relationship between aspiring actress Sally (Eleanor Parker) and nice guy G.I. Bill (Reagan).  Sally has foresworn love because her heart has been broken one time too many and Bill has seen his share as well but is ready to take a chance again.  The kids next door chemistry between Parker and Reagan is evident and you want their characters to make a go of it.  Eve Arden is on hand for comic relief as Parker's man crazy pal and Reagan's ex.  The film's stage origins are obvious taking place the majority of the time at Parker's apartment but it does not feel stagy or claustrophobic.  A genuine sleeper for romantics of all stripes.",1444521600,2,1137,4.534313725490196

5374992,4,B00A1AU6VC,"If you can be charmed by spritely writing and light hearted charm, this is a fine film from the 1940's.  On the other hand, if you like the arty and 'innovative' skip it.  And particularly if you are a foam-at-the-mouth hater of Ronald Reagan, skip it is as well, because the same charm that made him an effective political figure is readily apparent in this film.  But the film also presents two contrasting yet engaging women, Eve Arden and Eleanor Parker.  Surprisingly, as a fairly generic romantic-comedy from WWII days, the writing keeps it from being seriously dated. My personal rating would be five stars, but those with some built in blinders to its charms, probably even four stars is a bit high.",1393804800,3,707,4.723577235772358

5374995,4,B00A1AU6VC,"I saw this when it was first released in theaters and was entranced.  When dvds came along I looked for it expectantly, but it never appeared, perhaps because Ronnie was now famous for other reasons.  Nevertheless I never gave up hope, and was delighted when it finally appeared on Amazon.  Big question--after 66 years, would it still hold up.?
The answer, for me, is that it held up surprisingly well.  The plot may be a bit hokey by today's standards, but I had aImost forgotten what a delightful ditz Eleanor Parker made.  Even Ronnie showed up well--far better than in some of the  morale boosters he made during the war.  If your tastes aren't too modern for you to enjoy a sweet romantic comedy with no nudity or sex, this may be for you.",1390867200,7,745,4.514925373134329

Also, finally I was able to see how the story begins.  It periodically is shown on TCM, but somehow I either was not available to watch it or tape it.  The last time I did try to tape it, my sound setting was wrong and all I have is basically the video with extremely low inaudible sound.  That has been over half a year.  So, when I checked during the day after Thanksgiving and saw it was at a discounted price, I decided this was the opportunity I was waiting for.

Have watched the DVD at least three times so far and enjoy its clarity and again, finally I know how the story begins!  It makes a lot more sense as to why the Eleanor Parker character is hesitant about falling in love again.

Thanks Amazon!  What a pleasant entertaining treat!",1388448000,6,916,4.286549707602339
5374998,5,B00A1AU6VC,"This movie goes under ""One from the Book"" often, which has made it confusing for most to track down.  Warner Brothers finally released it to DVD (in the USA anyway), and they have good print quality as well.  My parents and family can finally put the faded copy, full of commercials into the garbage.

A romantic comedy -- strong cast - and Ronald Reagan is pretty darn charming too in this.  The chemistry is strong as well -- with the two leads -- you get the feeling they liked each other a great deal.  It is a great movie to for those with a romantic heart that yearns for the renewal of Spring to be in the air.

5375004,4,B00A1AU6VC,"The above quote is from the Old Testament of the Bible, specifically the book the ""Song of Songs"" also known as the ""Song of Solomon"", and the `turtle' referred to is not the reptile, but the turtle dove. It's my favorite line from the film and also one of my favorite quotes for the season of spring. This is a film adaption of a romantic comedy by John Van Druten, that was one of the biggest smash hits on Broadway in the 1940's, opening  December 8, 1943 and running for 1,557 performances finally closing in 1948.

Here's a synopsis, Sally Middleton (Eleanor Parker), a young, rather nave struggling actress in Manhattan during World War II is nursing a bruised heart as the result of a recent unhappy love affair with a married Broadway producer Kenneth Bartlett (Kent Smith).  Although it's technically spring, the weather isn't cooperating, and she feels in her present state of mind that spring is never going to arrive.  One rainy Friday afternoon, her older, savvier actress friend Olive Lashbrooke (Eve Arden) drops by for a visit and cocktails.  Olive is having a soldier acquaintance Sergeant Bill Page (Ronald Reagan) pick her up at Sally's for a weekend"" fling"".  While she waits Olive checks her phone messages and finds that her current heartthrob Commander Ned Burling (Wayne Morris) is in town for the weekend and wants to see her.  To ditch Bill gracefully, Olive cooks up a bogus story that she is meeting her estranged husband because it is his last leave before he will be shipped overseas.  She leaves Bill and Sally together, since neither has plans Bill takes Sally out to dinner, and they have a warm rapport.  As the weekend progresses they spend it together at the apartment and begin to fall in love.  However, Sally is scared to risk her heart a third time, (she had another failed romance ahead of the more recent one), and she is determined to keep things light, romance yes, love no.  Bill himself burned once before is willing to open his heart, but also is determined not to be in love unhappily.  Meanwhile Olive disillusioned by Ned's changes since the last time she saw him, is annoyed to lose Bill to Sally, and starts to meddle.

In 1943, when ""The Voice of the Turtle"" opened on Broadway, the play was considered rather daring and groundbreaking.  Sally Middleton though a well-bred ""nice"" young lady has had two love affairs and isn't a virgin, and she sleeps with Bill the second night they're together.  Definitely not your usual ingenue at that time!  However with the Hays Code still going strong in Hollywood, in the film Sally and Bill do NOT make love, although tempted, and Sally's romantic past is soft pedaled. The inference is that despite the two prior relationships,Sally is still unblemished. Playwright John Van Druten skillfully toned down his play when adapting it to the screen without losing any of its charm.

It's regrettable however that the movie suffers from miscasting in the role of Sally, and in a lesser degree in that of Bill.  One of my favorite classical film actresses the luminous, legendary Margaret Sullavan originated the role of Sally Middleton.  This was a much praised performance, she won the Donaldson Award for Best Actress (a predecessor of the Tony Awards for theatrical excellence), and was the definitive factor in the success of the play.  It remains her most memorable stage performance.  Ms. Sullavan was 38 however when the movie was made, past playing a 22 year old girl, and although she excelled in film, it was not her favorite mtier, she preferred the stage. So, the role was given to Eleanor Parker, suitably girlish, BUT sporting the same hairstyle and a similar voice to that of Sullavan, and frankly she imitates her at times.  I don't know whether she was directed that way or not, but I've never been fond of carbon copies. Although Ms. Parker tries earnestly, and has some good moments, she doesn't have the stardust to light up the screen, and has a couple of ""cute"" pieces of business that are overdone. The perfect choice would have been Judy Garland, who at that point was at the peak of her film career; she would have brought a radiance and vulnerability to the role, similar in many ways to her sensitive portrayal in 1945's ""The Clock.""  I remember reading somewhere that Van Druten had Garland in mind when he created the role of Sally Middleton; a pity she didn't get a chance to play it on the screen.

Ronald Reagan fares better, his playing of Bill Page is one of his best performances in his rather limited range as an actor, he's relaxed and likeable, a good standard issue leading man.  Still it would have been interesting to have one of the better young actors of the day say Gregory Peck, Joseph Cotten or William Holden in the role.

The real winner who comes close to stealing the film at times is Eve Arden as Olive Lashbrooke.  Even though she is playing a kind of heavy, Ms. Arden does it with a panache and dry humor similar to Rosalind Russell's Sylvia in ""The Women"".  It's not possible to dislike her; you can only shake your head and laugh at her vain, self-absorbed prattling. Her final line is a clever one reworked by Van Druten to get by the censors, and delivered directly to the camera.

To finish, although it's necessarily dated, ""The Voice of the Turtle"" is still a lighthearted, engaging remembrance of a more innocent, simpler era. It has a winsome charm that is most refreshing in this current jaded age.  If you are a romantic at heart, you will want to experience its sweet, nostalgic pleasures.",1360281600,6,5544,4.709109730848861
