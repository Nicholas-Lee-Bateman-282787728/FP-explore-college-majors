124688,5,0792102320,"Fabulous movie.  Real buried treasure.  John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, and Patricia Neal at the peak of their powers.  What's so special?  For one thing, John Wayne and Patricia Neal.  They give us a romance between a REAL  man and a REAL woman. Bravo to Otto Preminger for not casting a starlet or  some other pointless screen beauty as Wayne's love interest. You don't see  that these days. The result, John Wayne is very sexy.  Great black and  white photography, too! DVD, Yes!  Colorize, NO!",946684800,4,491,4.726190476190476
124689,5,0792102320,"I own this movie,in black and white. I think it is a classic like Patton and The Longest Day. It needs to be put on DVD with 5.1 sound and colorized. I would buy it in a minute.",944524800,3,177,3.6842105263157894
124690,4,0792102320,"It takes an expert hand to mix historical fiction, solid action, maudlin melodrama and stock romantic entanglements and emerge with a coherent story, much less an effective and entertaining film, but Otto Preminger  manages the trick with In Harm's Way.  John Wayne's acting is John Wayne's  acting (just replace the cavalry smock with WWII working khaki), but the  true stars of the film are Kirk Douglas, Burgess Meredith and Patricia  Neal, all of whom do a wonderful job of augmenting and supporting the Duke  without getting in his way.  The combat scenes are few and far between and,  by today's standards, rather tame.  However, this seeming weakness proves a  hidden strength in what becomes an excellent character study of divergent  people thrown together in the chaotic early days of the Second World War.  This film does a very good job of showing the difficulties commanders faced  in dealing with equipment shortages, personnel problems and the myriad  headaches of a combat commander trying to fight a war on a shoestring.  In  some respects the plot is a bit predictable but nonetheless holds one's  attention.  Like most Wayne pictures, this ends up being a flag-waving  tribute to the heroism of the American  fighting man and woman.  What makes  this one a bit different is the degree of character development.  It  doesn't take long before you actually start caring about the people and the  combat becomes a secondary issue.  As with most of  the Duke's movies,  there is a good dollop of tongue-in-cheek humor to lighten the mood.  The  final result is a very effective, surprisingly realistic look at the people  side of warfare.",944179200,16,1652,4.985239852398524
124691,5,0792102320,"this movie is the best and that is saying something with all the war movies that came out after the war. otto knows what he is doing and john and kirk really show us why they are the stars they are. the movie starts  us out on dec 6 just before pearl harbor. we get to see how men were  wrongly accused after the fact and how one officer bounces back after the  demotion. he meets a nurse who will follow him in harms way, as will his  son. this movie has a happy ending but with alot of loss of life ie alot of  characters we meet soon will meet there maker. sad but thats how it was.  have a good 3 hours with this one you will wish you could have been there",913852800,,660,3.8518518518518516

125083,4,0792102320,"In Harms Way is a classic example of historical fiction at its best. It has an all star cast and the acting is in sink with the times that produced the film. Those who enjoy the film, as I did, understand that this film was done in a era what produced some of the finest stars of Hollywood. Actors like John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Burgess Meredith, and Kirk Douglas set the standard. World War II is a time in American History that defined us as a nation and was the the crowning of the ""American Century."" The film is more than just a story about people with faults and short-comings, its also about over-coming those faults for common cause. Kirk Douglas character rapes a young nurse but sacrifices his life to gather intel on the Japanese fleet. Both John Wayne and Patricia Neal characters get past the damage that their first marriage caused to fine love for each other and to fine fulfillment in military service. The final battle ended with the reality that victory always comes with a high cost.",1490918400,,1001,4.535911602209945

125085,5,0792102320,Some fiction mingled with historical account. Side plots; the realistic do nothing commander with hesitant decisions that eventually cost lives. Enter John Wayne given rear admiral to get the job done. The imperial Navy attacks at night but withdraws due the heroic efforts of the outnumbered Navy. That was typical for WW2. A horny self centered navy captains wife likes to party it up at military gathering. At the beach in the morning is a classic. She pokes the man from the night before to wake up. It is done as if she cant stand him. Her husband himself at sea. Not the best of a person and unfortunately reminds us of what can happen to a woman if she flirts to the wrong man. The large loss of men and family members the horrible war. Nice shots of Hawaii in the old days. You can barley make out Diamond head in the background of some scenes shot near the Honolulu airport today. Scenes of the navy crewman going through preparation war. Very well done to understand some of their jobs and the ships back then. Tough rear admiral needs comfort of not to be left alone by his nurse at the end. It is not as realistic as war movies today. Where today's war movies you walk out with PTSD. So If you are a favorite for the old actors. It's a good flick. Burgess Meredith is good as well. Some of your historians can find parts of historical battles mixed into this fictional story. One note of bloopers. Kirk Douglas takes off in a B25 bomber but they called a few times a PBY. Perhaps a last minute change.,1490313600,,1513,4.387900355871886
125086,4,0792102320,"I recently watched In Harms Way on Amazon Instant Video. My overall reaction to this film about World War II is mixed. On one hand, it features famed director Otto Preminger, and an all-star cast that includes John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Patricia Neal, Burgess Meredith, and Brandon DeWilde. On the other hand, its screenplay, written by Wendell Mayes, seems at times more focused on a rather silly soap opera than it does on the war.

John Wayne plays Admiral Rockwell Rock Torrey, formerly a Navy cruiser captain who initially overcomes questions about his seamanship, eventually gets a promotion, and rises to command of a Navy task force sent on a critical mission against the Japanese. Along the way, he meets his estranged son (Brandon DeWilde), now a Navy ensign, who despises him. He also meets a Navy nurse (Patricia Neal) and begins an affair with her. Torreys executive officer, Commander Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas)  further complicates Torreys life  with his emotional instability and frequently violent temper

This all takes place against the backdrop of the early years of World War II in the Pacific.  Battle scenes are loosely based on actual military operations that took place during the Navys island-hopping campaign through the central Pacific in 1942-1944.  I cant tell if the climactic battle near the end of In Harms Way is based more upon the naval Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942 or upon the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944.

In Harms Way is mostly about the good fight in the Pacific war, with lots of heroics  and patriotism from our main protagonist, Admiral Rock Torrey. The acting is uniformly very good, with only a couple of minor exceptions. Wendell Mayes' story is relatively straightforward and  easy to follow, despite the fact it is bloated in places by rather complex, soapy subplots. In Harms Way also suffers from being a bit over-long, weighing in at a whopping 2 hours, 45 minutes.

In Harms Way adds very little that is new to the canon of World War II filmography.  Made in 1965, it applies mid-1960s sensibilities to a film that probably would have been better had it been made fifteen or twenty years earlier. As it is, this is more a vehicle for its aging stars than anything else. Nevertheless, it is a reasonably well crafted film that I found very entertaining. Recommended.

First, and I could see this before I read the trivia section, John Wayne was off his game. His energy was down due to his cancer.  He was depressed through the whole movie.  Second, the cinematography was very two dimensional, almost as if it were filmed on stage. Notice how many times the players 'line up' in front of the camera, or even play up to the camera.  Thought the script was fine, but the direction and scene layouts were too canned.",1481241600,,571,4.367924528301887

Instead of featuring a lot of action sequences, this film is overwrought with the sordid problems of several characters too many.  Theres infidelity, rape, a backstabbing glory seeker, an estranged son, political potshots, threats of a court-martial, dancing, dating, and oh yeah, there was a war going on (that one character refers to as being trumped up).  Of the huge cast, Burgess Meredith, Patricia Neal, and Henry Fonda managed to do the most with their roles.  (Patricia Neal received a BAFTA award for Best Foreign Actress).  John Wayne appeared a bit listless throughout but then he was fighting lung cancer at the time.

It has all of those things in it-love, betrayal, danger, conflicts, relationships and loss. I watch this movie quite often and never get tired of it.

125983,1,0792102320,"In B&W and a bit of a disappointment.  It seems the film is macho and not well directed.  Otto Preminger's work declined after Exodus or so this is taught.  It appears to be true. John Wayne is a little tired in this one. Kirk Douglas is a little too mean. Women are portrayed a little too girlish and under prepared.  A rape scene should ever be put into any film, considering these times.  That used to be okay.  Drama is drama, but it didn't add anything. Looking at how Exodus was done, it would have made far more sense in that movie.  It was much more violent and for a reason.  Skip this one though.  The violence didn't convert into drama.

There was one performance to credit in this movie, that of the young Lt. (j.g.), Tom Tryon, he thin blonde guy.  He came across as the best overall performer outdoing the other far more seniors.  Patricia Neal was a bit old for this movie as an opposite to John Wayne.",1439337600,,917,4.298245614035087

John Wayne, as Captain and later, Admiral Rockwell Torrey gives an understated performance here but perfectly in keeping with the character he was portraying.
Patricia Neal, as nurse Maggie Haynes, is quite good as is Kirk Douglas, whose character's inner rage over his wife's affair finally surfaces with tragic consequences. Henry Fonda is impressive as the commander in chief and later played the same character(Admiral Nimitz) in the film Midway.",1438214400,,582,5.268817204301075

126155,5,0792102320,"BOTTOM LINE: If you like John Wayne, World War II flicks or just good movies in general, then IN HARM'S WAY belongs in your collection. It's well worth the 167 minutes you'll spend watching it. 5 STARS for this most excellent war-themed motion picture.

THE STORY: The film opens the evening before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and runs through to the U.S. attempts to establish a strategic military presence in the Philippines. Though based on actual historic events, the characters in this film, and their stories, are all fictional.

THOUGHTS: John Wayne and Kirk Douglas headline an amazing cast of both well-known big stars and outstanding character actors, to give this film an epic feel. All of the actors are at the top of their game here. Speaking of which, there are a TON of stars in this. As my wife said while we watched, ""Is there anyone who ISN'T in this?"" It's just an excellent, excellent, excellent movie, (did I mention that it's excellent?), with enough plot here for three regular films. In fact, IN HARM'S WAY plays a lot like a feature film that's been condensed from a mini-series. Director Otto Preminger has firm control of the proceedings and steers it with a tried, steady hand. It's in glorious widescreen and beautiful black & white. The visual F/X are dated but even so, the complex model work used for the major sea battles looks pretty good for the most part and doesn't detract from the overall viewing experience. Surprisingly, for an involved motion picture that's almost 3 hours long, it seemed to breeze right by. Regrettably, I had never seen this film before, but it now instantly ranks up there as one of my favorite John Wayne films and definitely one of the better WWII movies I've ever seen. Too bad this didn't play more when I was growing up, but being in B&W kept it from showing in primetime and its long running time pretty much ruled it out for airing during those Saturday/Sunday afternoon movie blocks.

THE DVD: The standard-def DVD release of IN HARM'S WAY is unspectacular, but serviceable. This movie needs (and deserves) a full-blown restoration on hi-def Blu-ray. Until then, this DVD version will do. And truthfully it does look & sound pretty good. Bonus features are limited to a vintage ""Making of"" featurette and 3 different theatrical trailers for the film.",1431993600,2,2328,4.800498753117207

126293,5,0792102320,"Made in the days of the All-Star Casts, when black-and-white was still the signal of a Grown-Up movie. Nevertheless I saw it when I was about 9, because my aunt thought it must be good because it was an Otto Preminger movie! It's still marvelous, holds up better than any other 1960s movies about WW2. It's about naval officers going in harm's way, like John Paul Jones. One is a hardscrabble captain, played by John Wayne, another is a spoiled Harvard brat, his long-lost son, played by Brandon de Wilde. Then there is the unstable Kirk Douglas character, whose sexy young wife is a nymphomanic who gets herself killed on Pearl Harbor day, and who then rapes the fiancee of Brandon de Wilde, and atones for it by going on a lone suicide reconnaissance mission in which he spots the Yamata and gets shot down. Meanwhile you have opportunistic career officers and political appointees (Dana Andrews, Patrick O'Neal) trying to screw everything up, and heart-of-America men and women trying to fix everything up (Henry Fonda, Patricia Neal). This is probably the best WW2 navy movie ever made.",1425686400,,1090,4.834224598930481

126454,5,0792102320,"I love this movie and I've watched it several times. It's a great naval war movie that deals in both fact and fiction. It starts with the relaxed party atmosphere that was Pearl Harbor on December 6, 1941 and how that changed 8 hours into December 7.  Then the movie follows the main characters from Pearl out into the Japanese held South Pacific where the U.S. starts to take the war to the Japanese.

The acting is first rate and features some of the biggest stars of the day. John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Patricia Neal, and Burgess Meredith deliver great performances. The special effects leave a bit to be desired; not unexpected for a black and white 50 year old movie. But the depiction of a naval surface battle between battleships, cruisers, and PT boats is extremely well done. You can feel the tension and fear of those involved.

Please don't let the 1965 release date put you off. If you like a good war story and great acting then you owe it to yourself to see this movie.",1424390400,4,982,4.4748603351955305

126489,5,0792102320,"This double VHS was released in 1965 and is 165 minutes long It is totally B & W.Several Reviewers have been critical that it was not in color,especially since color was almost the standard at the time. However;one should remember that even at the end of WWII,most movies were still in B & W ,particularly war movies. During the war there was no TV and all news releases,and other photographs of the war were in B & W.Also;this movie has a lot of images that were taken at the time and it is much more realistic when incorporating therm into the movie. In other words,B & W is a preference over color.
 This is an excellent movie that brings much more personal involvement of the military at the time. There is a great difference between war movies from Europe and those from the Pacific;that being the US involvement in Naval War. Also, in Europe the war  started in 1939 and in the Pacific it started with the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.
 The movie covers a relative short period of only about 2 years where the war in fact continued for about two years longer. There are a lot of characters involved and the personal issues and experiences in their lives. The actual scenes involving battles is a relatively short percentage of the movie.
The moviis has a super cast of actors,some of the best actors at the time.
There are some excellent movies about the war in the Pacifig that have become classics and in my estimation ,this is one.",1424131200,,1440,4.509578544061303

126491,3,0792102320,"I've seen this film many times over the years, have read the other reviews and now offer my own.  First off, the film is based on a novel...i.e. it is fiction, and is not intended as an accurate portrayal of historical events. So when you don't recognize the names of people, ships, or places...calm down.  Having said that, a picture released in 1965 but set in 1941-42 should at least be dressed/designed appropriately. This film opens with a straight-haired girl go-go dancing to hot jazz wearing a form-fitting knee-length dress...8 seconds after a title card shows ""December 6, 1941"".  Understandably, some reviewers were a little put-off by this, and other anachronisms contained in the picture.

We quickly move to the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor...which shows no devastation, lasts all of 5 minutes, elicits virtually zero panic from those on the bridge of a ship escaping the harbor, and is followed in short-order by a scene at another dance.  This sets the theme for the next 2 hrs 30 minutes of this epic...periodic battle action...some of it decent...cast against multiple mini-melodramas...most of them bad although, somewhat, intertwined.

I won't summarize the entire picture but will recommended it for viewing...on a slow day...for the following reasons. The cast, and for the most part the casting, is excellent...although the performances themselves are rather shallow and unevolved.  Maybe this was Preminger's intention.  For Wayne, maybe it was because by the time filming ended, he was coughing up blood and within a few weeks had to have a cancerous lung and a few ribs removed to...well...stay alive another 15 years and win a couple of Oscars, one honorary. I felt the chemistry between Wayne, Douglas, and Meredith was believable...especially considering that Wayne and Douglas had never met prior to this picture and were polar opposites politically. Meredith was even blacklisted for a time. But these professionals put aside those differences and played well together on screen.  Patricia Neal was great, but the temperature between her's and Wayne's characters was luke-warm at best. Again, they were older, saltier generational military and maybe the actors were reflecting this in their performances.

Adequate added support from the likes of Henry Fonda, Carroll O'Connor, Paula Prentiss, Dana Andrews, Slim Pickens, even Larry Hagman (briefly) rounds-out this World War II Epic...the last old-school one filmed in glorious Black and White and also Wayne's last B&W film.  Very good cinematography, a decent score, inconsistent quality special effects, some of them down-right bad (the added smoke just hangs and meanders at times). Video and sound all superb in the version I am reviewing.  Enjoy!",1423958400,,2740,5.302540415704388

Until a better one comes along, this is my all time favorite movie, across several genre's.  It's a great war movie, it's a great romance movie, and has Kirk Douglas as the second slimiest villain in the plot.  The slimiest being the former Congressman on the Admiral's staff.  No one can top a Congressman as a villain, I think. It also had a good plot twist, or two, and World War II for a background.  What can beat that?",1419552000,,549,4.240384615384615

There is an all-star cast including John Wayne, Patricia Neal and Kirk Douglas as the headliners.

It is interesting to see how men were men and women were women and they had the same foils as today. There are no social or political undertones pushing an ideological agenda or other common film themes of today; however, there is some racial play on touching on the distrust felt by Americans at the time toward the Japanese.
There are no gratuitous sex scenes or harsh language.

It's not a gung-ho hero movie and definitely not typical of the genre.  The valor depicted is more nuanced, and more substantial.  This is a depiction of ordinary but variously flawed people coping in extraordinary times.  The battle scene won't be mistaken for modern computer graphics, and the storyline and pace aren't perfect, but this is a solid movie with a great cast.

It would wake you from a dead sleep (as it was meant to be). The ""THIS IS NOT A DRILL, THIS IS NOT A DRILL!"" meant you weren't practicing anymore, this is the real thing and you could die!  This is John Wayne's best war movie as far as I'm concerned, much better than the ""Green Berets.""

If you don't watch another WWII Navy flick,  watch this one.",1417478400,,653,4.260162601626016

The copy of the movie we watched stuttered too often and dropped lots of dialogue while streaming.  But the poor quality was not caused by the streaming process. I would rewind to recapture the dialogue and the same video stutter and dropped dialogue would occur, no matter how many times it was rewound.

128028,5,0792102320,"The movie starts off with scenes of career naval officers, men and women, and their families and friends before WWII. They are caught in a careerist bureaucracy on Oahu, and some are sliding off the edge of life into the deep end--in one form of debauchery or another. But, this is a 1960 movie and the debauchery is tastefully presented, the penalties are providentially received, and watching this would serve useful life lessons to middle grade and up. The aforesaid prologue lasts about a dozen minutes into the story, and then the Japanese aircraft arrive overhead and start WWII for the USA. This was a dicey moment in American history, and the characters realistically deal with the sudden demands placed upon them. Some rise to unforeseen heights, some fail the test, and some find redemption in the chaos. As a former Marine of the next generation, I very much liked this movie for the strong and true-to-life characterizations, splendid sets and seascapes, initial maneuvering against ambitious foes--whether the Japanese or fellow officers, and the first fruits of a successful mix of war planning and courage both in island hopping and sea battle.

While the overall backdrop of the war in the Pacific is played well, the individual characters, complete with their flaws, are done very well -- complete with the ""uncomfortable"" social issues of previous relationships, children from those relationships, cheating spouses, and yes, even rape.  Those are subjects not often found in a WW II movie, and this film incorporates them well.

When I first saw this movie it came as a surpise to me on how much I really enjoyed this movie and whenever I catch it on TV I always watch it. My only exception was in one of the opening scenes I don't think thigh high dresses were worn yet in the 1940's....but who cares about such small details when Eddington's wife was simpy hot!! :-) Other than that it's a Great movie!,1400457600,,423,4.0476190476190474

It is long and sometimes torrid but nonetheless a great story of courage, love, Navy politics, and warfare in the Pacific.  There are some excellent performances, notably by Patricia Neal, Burgess Meredith, and a host of other actors whom you'll recognize--many became prominent actors later in their careers.  John Wayne plays John Wayne as only John Wayne can, but he is effective enough as Admiral Rock Torrey, and Kirk Douglas hams his way across the screen with swashbuckling style.  This is not a serious art film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a capable companion to better WWII Navy films like Midway, Destination Tokyo, and Run Silent, Run Deep.",1400284800,,739,4.935483870967742

I was able to watch it to the end without having skips or freeze up as I have experienced in a DVD from another company.  I always enjoy John Wayne. This was a great movie to watch to remind us of the rough life our soldiers have experienced and be grateful for those sacrifices.  My father was in World War II and lived with shrapnel in his body and wore a brace on his leg.  When his battleship was bombed, someone that saved him said that if it weren't for the salt water which helped heal his wounds, he would never have survived. This movie made me think of all my father went through and wish I had appreciated those sacrifices while my father was still alive and let him know I realized that there was no way I would ever really know the terror of war.",1400284800,,835,4.173913043478261

128765,5,0792102320,"A classic fictional WWII Duke Wayne action flick ... the reason I rate it so highly is personal, I lived in Hawaii when they made the film and gathered some personal anecdotes about the filming (such as the theft of the B-25 by a joyrider not connected with the movie, and some riotous evenings around Oahu when the Duke and Kirk Douglas and a couple of others had a mai-tai or two and went testing doors for 'punchability' ...

The miniature effects are only passable by today's standards, and if you're looking for roses and lollipops, this isn't your flick. In fact, the whole thing is pretty downright grim, I don't think there's an instant of comic relief, indeed ANY kind of relief, from the oppressive (but necessary) atmosphere throughout. It's Otto Preminger's hand here, so this is intentional and effective storytelling. But it's definitely not one for the kids.",1398816000,,873,4.82

The first battle scene is reminiscent of the USS Ward engaging an IJN mini sub. off Pearl Harbor and sinking it. The climax of the movie is a play on the heroics of Taffy 3 in the Battle off Samar. John Wayne does a splindid job playing the part of CAPT (then RADM) Rock Tory as the US Navy starts it's island hoping campaign across the Pacific. The movie has a wonderful cast.

The director spent considerable time ensuring it was relatively accurate, and filming in B&W was a nice touch -- it also helped cover up the fact that the models weren't really good ones -- models have come a long way since 1964.  The chemistry between the Duke and Patricia Neale is pretty good -- she later admitted that he didn't do anything for her, so I guess it shows she was a good actress. Duke as a Navy Captain leading a crew in battle is always good. Typical of the time it isn't really bloody, and people don't get torn in half or anything like that -- Sam Peckinpah didn't make a splash with that kind of cinematography for another five years with The Wild Bunch. The Duke was made for the role of combat hero, in my opinion, and inspired a lot of members (and future members) of the US military without having served himself. You can't hate that. I didn't care for the Kirk Douglas role of Eddington, but I guess there's always some character you don't like because of what he represents. All in all a good flick.

Just listen to the gentle wave sound of the Japanese fleet cutting through the water and fog, along with the ominous stand-alone percussion, and your mind doesn't need additional pictorial of the danger ahead.

There is a real plot here, I am not a movie critic but I think this is one of Otto Preminger's ground breaking movies where he really tested the limits of what Americans were willing to watch in 1950.  This movie takes you through some real interpersonal tensions that are not normally seen in this type of movie.

I rate it very high for the plot, the acting and the issues that this director are dealing with and delivering on the screen for us to appreciate. It's not bullets and sinking ships, it's real tension, US Naval authority is challenged, this is a great movie.

Picture quality and audio quality were excellent - streamed using Amazon Prime.",1397692800,,763,4.637037037037037

128901,5,0792102320,"Rated as five stars because of the fine coverage of the early days of WWII from a US Navy viewpoint. Some of the plot is a bit off the mark, but no matter, not many people will know that the beach scene with Kirk Douglas and the young nurse is actually on Oahu rather than Gavabutu (Chinaman's Hat in the background is a dead giveaway).

128940,4,0792102320,"This film is very supportive of the courage and fortitude of our military forces.  It doesn't have the greatest effects, but the battle scenes are real enough to keep you watching.

The all star cast is very good overall.  In fact, I think this is one of John Wayne's best acting roles I've ever scene.  Kirk Douglas and Burgess Meredith are fabulous and so is Patricia Neal.  Carol O'Conner makes a good appearance as well.

However, this film falls in line with some other ""dark"" military pictures regarding WW2 that started with the soap operish ""From Here to Eternity"".  This one has some of the same elements - behind the scenes adulterous affairs, drunk wives who shed their clothes, even a rape by Douglas's character of a young nurse.  These are the scenes that are the most ""dated"" in acting quality.  Paula Prentiss and Barbara Bouchet perform their drama with all the nuance of a 60's daytime soap opera.

The part I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Wayne's character and his son, particularly his son's transformation from a political user to a genuine man of character.  I also thought the film demonstrated the grim reality of our vulnerability in the early months following the attack on Pearl Harbor.  There was no clear indication that we were going to be successful against the Japanese.

So, while I thought the soap drama was overdone, the film is worth viewing just for the interesting, more human role that Wayne plays.",1397088000,,1454,4.791164658634538

Let's see, there's also Patricia Neal, Tom Tryon, Paula Prentiss, Stanley Holloway, as the Australian farmer, who helps the Navy, Franchot Tone, Patrick O'Neal as the slimy opportunist, Commander Neal Owen, Slim Pickens, even Archie Bunker...the list goes on and on, and it's produced by the great Otto Preminger. I've seen a Behind-the-Scenes special that detailed all the production problems...trying to make model ships believable as real ones, in times of combat, etc. Fascinating special about a great, great movie, and an inspiring story, which is based upon actual events. I found it inspiring; my Father and all my uncles were in the war; I have always been proud of them, and of all our guys who fight, to this very day, for our country.

The scape-goating after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the reasons it was ""allowed"" to happen being hinted at, the hidden war of subterfuge and spy vs counterspy, bravery, cowardice, misogyny and sexual assault in the military, all way of ahead of it's time in America at the time.  Then there is the cast, I don't know of another film that enlisted a more astounding  group of current (for then) and future great performers, from John Wayne and Kirk Douglas to Paula Prentiss, this casting director nailed it top to bottom, no average performances by anybody,  I compare it's refreshing truthful depiction of war to ""Saving Private Ryan"", just with a little more emphasis on the esoteric than the horror and mayhem.",1390435200,,949,4.721212121212122

129588,4,0792102320,I watch this movie about once a year. Nice to find it on Amazon for free streaming as a Prime member. John Wayne is great and has a good supporting cast for a reasonably good fictional war story with glimpses into what personal lives may have been like for some Navy people during the beginning of WWII.

129649,5,0792102320,"While I have never considered John Wayne to be a great actor, there were a few movies where he was cast in roles that were more believable than the ""larger than life"" characters that he often played.  This movie is one of them.  I always thought he did a very good job in this movie, with a more understated and realistic portrayal of the ""Rock Tory"" character.  Patricia Neal was always an exceptional actress, and she was simply great in her roll as ""Maggie Haynes.""  The remainder of the main characters played by Kirk Douglas, Burgess Meredith, Dana Andrews and Patrick O'Neal, Brandon De Wilde and Jill Haworth (two relative unknowns) were believable and well acted.  Even the ""smaller"" rolls were cast with some very good actors including Carroll O'Connor, George Kennedy, Slim Pickens, Paula Prentiss and even Henry Fonda.  The story is more interesting than the typical WWII movie, in that there are more story lines and character development than in other war movies produced around this time.

The weakness in the movie is not the acting, but the writing and, to a lesser extent, the editing.  The writers and production staff could have used some expert advice to make the plot more believable.  For instance, officers remove their hats inside, and all navy personnel wear their hats square to their heads and down over the forehead.  I doubt that anyone wears the hat according to regulations at any time in the movie.  That is a quibble, though, compared to the idea that a Naval officer, even an Admiral, would plan a massive land invasion and carry it out with sailors.  In spite of this, though, the movie is really enjoyable and the cast carries it off well.  It is also too long at about 3 hours.  We watched it on two nights to make the time work better.

I would recommend the movie for a few hours of enjoyable entertainment, but not to WWII buffs or serious naval careerists.",1387670400,,1041,4.455026455026455

129840,4,0792102320,"This movie is decidedly a tribute to the Pacific war era from a 60's perspective. The director was definately trying to capture the feeling on the ground from many angles. There are the civilian, military, and political views all wrapped up into an ensemble story that take place over the beginning of the US war with Japan to a time when the war turns in favor of the US. What this movie tries hard to do is mix the mundane with the action to show that while war is hell, it was also time that could be fun, frustrating, and boring.

John Wayne gives a great perfomance in this movie, one of his best ever, as a die hard leader without being the action hero. Kirk Douglas is a troubled right hand man, and more of the action hero, who eventually has to face what he is against his duty as a naval officer. Part of the genius of this movie is that it reminds us that there were relationships that began, existed, were finally swallowed up, and probably quickly forgotten during a conflict that was so epic in scale.

The main battle seems to be a smaller scale recreation of the epic battle at Leyte Gulf, mainly focused on the action that took place in the Serigao Strait. I thought it was well made, although the real battle in the Serigao Strait was decidedly a lopsided victory for the US Navy. The battle depicted in the movie is more of an 'against all odds' type of engangement, where winning isn't without great cost.

The movie is black and white, but this does not detract from the experience. It's long, but it tells a long tale, and is aptly directed.",1387497600,,1563,4.382758620689655

The film presents a relatively unromanticized and realistic picture of the American Navy and its officers in the period before and shortly after the start of World War II, complete with bureaucratic infighting among the brass and sometimes disreputable private acts by individuals.

130039,4,0792102320,"I think most of the reviewers misunderstand this movie. To make my case there may be spoilers ahead.
Your first clue that Otto Preminger's In Harm's Way is not intended as your typical World War II movie is the absence of heroic military march for the opening credits. Instead the movie opens with an unfaithful Navy wife dying in a fiery crash as Pearl Harbor is destroyed by a Japanese attack. The credits roll over an ominous silence broken only by the rhythm of waves washing onto the sandy beaches of Hawaii.

The rest of the movie is more or less a fictionalized discussion of the leadership and materiel problems faced in the opening months of World War II in the Pacific. Wayne as Capt. later vice Adm. (lower half) Rockwell ""Rock"" Torres plays out a version of the problems the Navy faced in the leadership and material issues involving real-life Adm. Gormley and Adm. Halsey and the battles in and around Guadalcanal. We first meet Capt. Tories in command of a cruiser which he nearly loses in an effort to chase down the withdrawing Japanese attack force. He is simultaneously covering for his alcoholic number two Commander Eddington (Kirk Douglas). It is quickly established that the John Wayne characteris second-generation Navy's, his father having served as a chief and whose instincts is to sacrifice all including if need be his own life and his own reputation to protect the Navy.

I draw your attention to the scene wherein Capt. Tories has allowed his cruiser to be torpedoed by not taking standard precautionary measures of enforcing a zigzag plan. He is speaking with his superior the soon to be departing and disgraced Adm. Kimmel. He is advised that he is likely to be found negligent for the damage to his command but that he could lawyer up and perhaps win his case. Capt. Tories states that as a  second-generation Navy man he will not  go public merely to obtain justice. In other words at his own personal expense he will not plead for justice for himself.

John Wayne will continue to dominate the screen and in in terms of his personality, his centrality as the leader of a combined fighting force and his brilliantly portrayed love affair with Navy nurse Lieut. Maggie Haynes (Patricia Neal). Parenthetically this romance between mature adults each with their own respective history of emotional battle damage is one of the best film portrayals of mature love; war movie or otherwise.
I would suggest that the viewer seriously consider this is actually a movie about the flawed Capt. Eddington.

Unlike his superior Capt. Eddington is not motivated by patriotism our love of the Navy. He is extremely loyal to Adm. Tories but outside of the presence of his superior Eddington is a moral derelict. The actual climax of this movie is not the crash of gunfire as we get a fictionalized cut down version of one of the key naval battles of Guadalcanal. Instead it is the complete failure of the Admiral, to deal honestly with his son or to consider how to bring justice to the memory of the nurse who was to become his daughter-in-law. Anymore specificity on what I believe is the true central plot point of this movie is to give away more than the too much I have just given you.

In Harm's Way looks like a classic American gung ho World War II movie. Atto Preminger gives us much more to consider than the problems of taking the initiative when you have neither the men nor the materials. In this respect it is more like: The Young Lions&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Young-Lions/dp/B00096S4DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Young Lions</a>&nbsp;or even a much older Kirk Douglas movie Paths of Glory&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paths-of-Glory/dp/B001BNYQ7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paths of Glory</a>. In all of these movies the actual action is a front behind which individuals must come to terms with moral ambiguities, military discipline and the personal values of loyalty honor and justice especially when these values conflict.

On the surface In Harms Way is arousing World War II blow `em up patriotic movie. That is most likely how you will see it in the first one or two viewings. I recommend you give it the necessary third or fourth viewing to understand how much deeper this movie goes.",1384732800,2,4329,5.0363128491620115

Consequently the Pacific Theater felt almost like a parallel universe, with only Hawaii being correctly identified.

130544,5,0792102320,"A classic movie about the beginning of the Pacific War during World War II.  John Wayne is Captain Rockwell (The Rock) Torrey an old ""sea salt"" who is the commander of a cruiser that was out to sea when Pearl Harbor is attacked on December 7, 1941.  While chasing a Japanese Submarine, his ship is torpedoes and Wayne is injured and ""mothballed"" due to Pearl Harbor and his ship being struck.
However, after a few months Captain Torrey is promoted to Rear Admiral after Admiral Nimitz (Henry Fonda) realizes what a valuable resource The Rock is and puts him in charge of taking back some Japanese held islands in the South Pacific.  I won't go much into the remaining details, but lets just say that Kirk Douglas is great as the Executive Officer under The Rock...However, he has SERIOUS issues, Patricia Neal is another ""old salt"" but a nurse and John Wayne's love interest.  Burgess Meredith, Carrol O'Conner, George Kennedy, and many other fine stars make this a great movie to have in anyone's World War II movie collection!

130624,3,0792102320,"This was Otto Preminger's attempt to show America's entry into the Pacific Theatre of WW2, with a good sampling of Preminger's strengths and weaknesses. Leading the cast is John Wayne, playing the same role he played in every movie he made, with Kirk Douglas as his troubled friend, and the always solid Patricia Neal as the love interest. The movie is large scale in many aspects, with great shots of admirals shuttling back and forth between boats and planes, and destroyers and cruisers dodging the attack on Pearl Harbor. But the film falters badly with some of the later naval battles, done in miniature, and looking that way. It is said that water is the hardest thing to make look real when done with models. In Harm's Way certainly demonstrates the truth of that adage. But there is much to like in this motion picture. The closing credits are a capsule summary of the entire war.

130833,5,0792102320,"In Harm's Way may not be the typical John Wayne movie perhaps only in that it was directed by Otto Preminger, a personality whose ego was just as big as John Wayne's, if not bigger.  Having said all of that, this movie should have as much appeal for John Wayne fans as any other movie that he made.  Great take on the story of the Pacific War with Japan in the first six months following the attack on Pearl Harbor with the effects on the personal lives of the characters in the story.  I love the comic relief provided by Burgess Meredith's character, a former Hollywood screen writer now thrust into the service of his country, bunking with his friend and soon to be admiral played by John Wayne.  It's the counterpoint to Wayne's other friend, a rather tragic figure played by Kirk Douglas. Douglas brings his typically famous acting style to a naval officer who is happy -go-lucky one moment while dark and brooding, even suicidal in moments beyond his control.

As an action/war movie, this is a good one.  Even though it clocks in at just under 3 hrs (167 mins to be exact), the scenes progress logically and at a good pace.  This is another movie that I saw when it was first released to theaters.  It plays just as well on the small screen as it did on the big one; of course, today's small screens have the advantage of being larger than older TVs.

The movie features an all-star cast that includes Patricia Neal, Tom Tryon, Paula Prentiss, Brandon De Wilde, Jill Haworth, and Dana Andrews.  Others in the cast include Stanley Holloway, Franchot Tone, Patrick O'Neal, Carroll O'Connor, Slim Pickens, James Mitchum, George Kennedy, Bruce Cabot, Barbara Bouchet, Hugh O'Brien, and Henry Fonda.",1371859200,,1701,4.65886287625418

I thought the movie was going to be more historical and mistakenly chose this for my thirteen year old sons, who are learning about WWII in school. There were mature themes that were a real down for my boys, including suicide, rape, and extramarital affairs.  Like the negative reviews said, the movie can drag in places.  There are many glowing reviews to recommend this movie, and it seems many of  these reviewers and 60s John Wayne buffs have panned the negative reviews.

131262,5,0792102320,"John Wayne and Kirk Douglas in one of the best WWII movies.
John Wayne is often thought of as a star of westerns, but in this movie, he shows his great basic acting ability.  His body language, facial expressions, and the excellent script writing gave him an opportunity for a versatility seldom seen in a western.  As the long time absent father meeting his son after years of absence, and his ""take charge"" qualities required for a military officer are roles he performs so well.

Kirk Douglas has always been excellent in any role, and here he is troubled, reluctant to live by military code, brave in the end, yet cowardly about facing consequences of his horrible treatment of a young lady.  His character brought mixed emotions, yet that reaction was one which was common at that time in our history.  War and its brutality, suddenly thrust upon this country, brought out the best in some, and the least admirable in others.  Great movie,  even though the military action may not have been historically accurate.

I was only 11 years old at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought our official entry into WWII.  As a young child, I sensed the sudden, horrific change in the actions, attitudes and reactions of everyone around me. I remember feeling a strange sort of relief that my own young father was already dead, from a sudden illness, so he would not be called off to fight in a war.",1361491200,,1408,4.622489959839357

(can't give away film), yet, douglas can't for the life of him key a microphone when using a two way radio. that's a huge flaw in a film depicting combat reality. if u love war movies, this will do fine but it is not a ""private ryan"". you will find the special effects wanting. for its time, it does hold up. over- all, this is typical hollywood glossy.",1361404800,,786,4.281879194630872

131320,2,0792102320,"Normally I like a good war picture by land,sea or air.  This is not one of them. Whoever says bigger is better do not know what their talking about.  At  170 minutes running time I found myself continuing waiting for the war to begin. I can never understand why movie studios make some westerns and war movies 130 to 170 minutes long with footage that only drags the movie out like when one Dean Martin western has Dean spend 15 minutes of the movie plotting out his escape plan but the studios would limit the running time of something like Twilight Breaking Dawn or Harry Potter films some my favorite running gags and bits from the books are edited out of the films. George Lucas and Speilberg proved that even movies with long running times can have the plot of the film keep moving forward and not put the audience to sleep or get off track.  Do think In Harms Way got off track when it comes to a naval base preparing a counter attack during a world war. My main want in any good movie from comedy, horror or war action is that story keep going start to finish.

 Besides a small Japanese battle near the beginning of the movie the rest of the sea battle (what there is of it)  remained in something like the final three chapters of this DVD.  The main body of the movie seems to be the young soldiers acting like Frankie Avalon taking their nurse girl friends to Hawaiian beach parties and such I never expected in a film with so many action/western stars as this film has. Sure there are some scenes with paratroopers and scouters reporting to those on war rooms.  This film isn't a Mchale's Navy type comedy so it should of have more focus on the war and less on the hanky panky. If you want a good John Wayne sea picture I'd recommend Sea Chase over this.",1360886400,,1765,4.340425531914893

131532,4,0792102320,"""In Harm's Way"" is not exactly a war movie, but rather a war time tale, describing the fate of a group of people during a period going from the beginning of War in Pacific (Pearl Harbor) to a great and bloddy (and fictious) battle some two and half years later.

Two main heroes are Captain Rockwell ""Rock"" Torrey (John Wayne) who in the beginning of the film is the commanding officer of a heavy cruiser in US Navy, and Commander Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas), executive officer on board of the same cruiser. As the film progresses we meet also other important characters: ""Rock's"" estranged son Jeremiah; a young nurse, Jill, who is Jeremiah's girlfriend; Maggie Haines, an older nurse who is ""Rock's"" love interest; Commander Egan T. Powell, an intelligence officer played magistrally by Burgess Meredith; a particularly weasely former Congressman who joined the Navy to try to come back later to politics; admiral Nimitz (played of course by Henry Fonda), Lieutenant McConnell, a particularly fearless young Navy officer; his wife Beverly, who lives in constant fear of receiving news of her husband death, etc., etc.

In minor roles you can find actors like Slim Pickens (""Dr Strangelove""), Lary Hagman (much later the infamous J.R. in ""Dallas"") and George Kennedy (you could see him in any of his 200 films, from ""Dirty Dozen"" to ""The Naked Gun"").

At 165 minutes it is a long film, but frankly I didn't see the time passing. Otto Preminger wanted to tell a long story with quite a lot of subplots and details and he managed to do it without ever losing control of his film. War is the ever present background to the story(ies) but there is not too many battles themselves - only in the beginning and at the very end of the film. Most of the film is devoted to show life in time of war, with its happier and darker moments.

Amongst the main lines of narration three go along the career troubles of ""Rock"" Torrey, his very difficult relation with his estranged son and his very recent blooming romance with Maggie Haines - and another one follows Paul Eddington, a man who was almost destroyed by a very bad marriage and who even years after its end still didn't pick together all the pieces of his broken mind.

With the exception of Pearl Harbor all the battles and almost all the locations shown in this film are pure fiction. The final fight seems to be mostly inspired by the Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October 1944), but the real story was greatly amended to make it more dramatic. If what you look for is action scenes or/and historical reconstructions, you risk to be very disappointed by this film.

It is in the description of the war time lifes that this film succeeds the best. Some of the interactions between characters are pretty violent ones - and they come with a very high price... As this is a war time story, some important characters will not make it to the end...

Bottom line, I liked this film, even if it took great liberties with history. Even if it is not really a masterpiece, it is a good, solid, war time story about life, love - and death... Enjoy!",1350518400,,3087,4.622262773722627

131565,3,0792102320,"The movie opens on Pearl Harbor on the evening of December 6, 1941. The naval officers are having a party. But we all know what's going to happen the next morning, don't we?

For one thing, Kirk Douglas' slutty wife is going to have a fatal car accident involving the young officer with whom she spent the night on the beach. When they are racing back to the naval base and go around a curve, and there's bullets whizzing everywhere, an army truck comes around the bend on the wrong side of the road, and they go over the cliff.

John Wayne is a courageous and inventive Captain, eventually promoted to Admiral, who didn't even know his son (Brandon de Wilde) had joined the navy. His parents divorced when he was four.

Henry Fonda is a southern-accented Admiral who is apparently supposed to represent somebody famous, because they never use his name. Mention is made of his having been a senator.

Burgess Meredith is a secret service agent, and also Wayne's room-mate in bachelor quarters back on Pearl.

Patricia Neal is a nurse who falls in love with Wayne.

The story basically involves the personal lives of these and quite a few other characters interwoven with the military action. I didn't understand all that much about the military stuff, except that Wayne was promoted to Admiral specifically to keep the Admiral already assigned to the region of islands to which Wayne is being assigned from messing everything up. He has friends in high places, so the commander (Fonda) cannot fire him, but he's indecisive and basically a failure as an admiral. At one point he briefs a bunch of reporters on a secret mission, then mentions ""You boys know better than to file your stories until I tell you to, don't you?"" Yeah, right. Great security, idiot.

There's a lot of heavy emotional material in this movie along with the naval operations. In fact, the naval stuff is explained pretty clearly for the most part.

A great part of the fleet was devastated and these men had to use  what ever was left to the best of their abilities to win this very important battle. Their patriotism high, and their sacrafice great. John Wayne was at his best in this movie in my opinion. The battle scenes were very convincing, and powerfully depicted. The movie also had some very risque' scenes in it and dealt with some adult manner and behavior which  was  pretty much taboo for that era.

131622,2,0792102320,"I'm giving this film two stars simply because it was suppossed to address WWII and for the many big stars in the movie. Stars one will recognize are: John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Patricia O'Neal,George Kennedy, Henry Fonda, Carrol O' Connor and more. Basically this movie seems to lack focus. I watched this movie wondering where it was going and trying to figure out what the general themes were. It's hard to figure out what this movie is really about because most of the ideas in the movie never quite have much of an impact. First, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. It was unbelievable in how the characters in the movie are not surprised at all by the attack. Where was the shock? And there is very little of the attack. Battleships ar sunk in the harbor, all is lost and the film just glosses over all of this. The attack is over and done with before it really even developed. In the battle with the submarine John Wayne breaks his arm. I couldn't believe how FAST three months passed in this movie. In one scene he reports to his superior with a broken arm and then suddenly it is three months later and soon after the cast is off. And the movie is hard to follow because of the pacing and the lack of development. And it may be me but Patricia O'Neal just doesn't cut it at all as a love interest for John Wayne or for anyone. I see this slow talking homely nurse, smoking a cigarette and I feel just like getting away. A romance between these two suppossed battle tested adults just doesn't work at all. But of course this movie has the two adults jumping into the sack before John Wayne is shipped off on assignment. And this movie has Pat O'Neal pursuing John Wayne. She asked him out. She came to his house and initiated SEX. Sure, this sort of stuff happened but the times too were often a lot different in the 40's. As others have said the movie injects sixties attitudes into a 40's set movie. An independent woman pursues a man and initiates sex. That is more of a sixties theme than a 40's theme. And Kirk Douglas's character is just a cliche. Kirk plays a drinking, fighting navy man with an unfaithful wife who dies after having comitted adultry. Later Kirk relives his wife's unfaithfulness when he has a flashback with the young nurse. So Kirk rapes a young girl who then commits suicide. To redeem himself Kirk goes on an airborne reconosance mission which was a suicide mission to atone for the rape, because afterall he was headed to prison anyway. All of the island battle that was to take place with the Japanese is poorly developed. Other than the naval battle there was no fighting on the island. John Wayne loses first his son on a PT boat and then his own leg. Wayne awakes on a hospital ship to face his creepy love interest Pat O'Neal. One of Wayne's fellow officers or a superior says that Wayne ""Is a hard man to kill"".

Really, this is a poor WWII movie with some big stars who seem pretty bored with the script. Wayne particularly seems to be unipressed with his dialogue and the script, but even Wayne at his best could have not saved this hodge podge of ideas. Some of the main ideas of the movie were: the attack of Pearl Harbor, the adulterous wife, a father who never was a father to his son, a rape and two suicides, a jealous admiral who tries to take credit for another's work, a man with a disentegrating military career, a son who comes to respect his father as he matures as a man, teasing a man can lead to rape, some confusing island warfare, etc.

Some of the special effects are quite good as in the sinking ship with the gaping gash in the side. The car going off the cliff has a dummy that is on fire whose head hits the windshield a few times. This scene is really out of place in movie that wants to be an epic drama. The car scene is straight out of a bad B movie. A simple head on collision crash without a body on fire in the car would have sufficed. In a 40's movie the car would simply have plunged off the cliff on fire or exploding on the rocks below. This movie injects a b movie car crash that is simply out of tone to the rest of the movie.

All in all this is pretty lame and long movie, but two stars.",1306713600,,4167,4.298982188295166

131626,3,0792102320,"...with a great cast, from a terrific storyteller. Despite the film's numerous faults, it is a movie I like and have watched more than once.

Otto Preminger made some of my favorite films, (Laura, Anatomy of a Murder, Man with the Golden Arm, etc), and he does tell an interesting story here, but the production values of the film are weak. First of all this is a period story of WWII in the pacific, told in a 1965 film. Preminger doesn't even bother to dress the actors in any type of 1940's clothing, let alone have their hair and makeup reflect the era the story takes place. The women in the film are all dressed like Jackie Kennedy in 60's era sheath dresses and Jackie-flip hairdos. The music gives a nod to 40's swing, but with 60's era arrangements. The naval battles against the Japanese look like they were done with toy boats, and the story is simplistic.

All of that said, Preminger's talent as a storyteller still prevails in this tale of an aging rear admiral (Wayne) who has to deal with WWII, a son from whom he is estranged (Brandon de Wilde), a mature nurse who is hot for him (Neal), a violent, alcoholic assistant (Douglas), an admiral who actively works against him (Andrews), and the suicide of his son's fiancee (Haworth). So this is a character-driven movie masquerading as an action film. I didn't mind the lack of action, because the actors really bring the characters to life, and their predicaments are absorbing.

Wayne is really brilliant as Admiral Torrey, who puts up with naval incompetence and internal politics to get his job  done This is the kind of role Wayne really excelled at in the great John Ford films. Patricia Neal is very good as the mature nurse who finds Wayne a big hunk of Heaven. Of course Douglas is terrific as the captain who can barely conceal his violent, angry nature, and I liked Tom Tryon's performance as the uber sexy naval officer and husband who sends his wife swooning at every opportunity. To be honest, he sent me swooning too.

So if you don't mind the character driven story, which fails to deliver on the action hero end of things, this is a good film to watch if you have three hours to relax for a movie.",1287792000,,2178,4.531806615776081

O`Connor, George Kennedy, Bruce Cabot, and more.
It starts with Pearle Harbour and extends to about the mid point of the war. And while the war is the main backdrop of the picture,
there are many sub plots amoung the characters, and the character developement is excellent. It is a war picture with more than
a few battle scenes, but it is more about the characters than the war.

131697,5,0792102320,"Its nice to see this classic movie in a new DVD edition.  While some may think this epic is long on drama and short on action, the acting is what secures it as a classic.  That and the cast.  Quite a collection of well known names here.  No need for me to rattle them off as most are quite well known.  Many might find fault with the old fashioned special effects which are certainly not state of the art.  But if given a choice between great special effects and poor storyline and acting, or campy special effects but great story and acting; which should you take?  The choice seems obvious.  Many films today suffer from the former problem.  Here you have an engrossing story with beleivebale characters and situations.  There is little that is over the top here.  There are heroics, but nothing fantastic.  Even  the theatre of operations is not center stage.  We are constantly reminded that these operations are secondary, and not the main action.  This also makes the storyline beleiveable.  John Wayne could have been admiral Nimitz. Instead he is merely a second stringer.  Again, realistic.  This film tries to convery what the Pacific War was for the ordinary, lesser known individuals.  That says a lot.  One can see this film inspired many later epics of a similier nature.  The recent Pearl Habor remake was one such sad effort.  Others come to mind, but none equal this straight-forward epic with a fine cast.

131698,2,0792102320,"The naval warfare aspects of the movie are reasonably well done but the whole thing is marred by the injection of some decidedly 60's sensibilities. Probably done to make it appealing to viewers of the time, (the film was made in '65) it noenthless manages to turn what would have been a fine movie into a mess.

Firstly, a minor but not insignificant point - the ""look"" of the movie was is clearly more 60s than 40's. The music (cha cha cha type stuff) is definitely not in line with what was popular in that decade, neither were the clothes (other than uniforms) or the women's hairstyles, background furnishings - anything really. As far as I can tell, the only effort to make it a period piece were the cars and the black and white film.

More importantly, the movie suffers from some decidedly 60s sensibilities of wanting to address serious issues (war not being serious enough) thus inserting some useless sexual subplots to make it more ""relevant"". I'm not suggesting there were no sexual elements to explore in a period piece, only that the way it was done fails to capture the mores of the time, before the sexual revolution. In addition the introduction of a heavy theme about rape is explored in a way which distracts from the rest of the movie without doing the subject justice. An additional subplot about a competent junior officer and his wife, runs through the movie almost as an afterthought.

Worse still, the moview has several scenes with 60s ""hip"" dialogue. In several parts of the film the characters appear to act ""dated"" as if they were out of easy rider.  As much as I'm a big fan of that movie, this failed as a historical war movie for me.

I realize I'm making a big thing out of it, but while I was watching it, I was constantly distracted by these elements which ruined it in my opinion.",1249257600,5,1818,4.5474006116207955

131736,2,0792102320,"I have to agree with most of the one and two-star reviews. This movie came to my attention as I was looking up Doug Stanton's excellent WWII book ""In Harm's Way,"" which is not at all related. There's talk about making Stanton's book into a movie; that would really be something, as there is drama galore in the story of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis!

This 1965 star-packed, epic movie surprised me in a lot of ways, most of them bad. I was watching lots of movies in the 60's and I don't remember seeing this one, so I wonder if that means it flopped even back then or did I somehow just miss it? At best this is a so-called B movie, though with all the stars in the cast I can't imagine it was low budget.

The characters, the dialogue, the story, and even the acting are all very wooden. Dramatic events don't seem dramatic; the characters seem to be going through the motions. Even the battle scenes are lackluster. Sadly, the most exciting scene in the Pearl Harbor attack is a car crash. You will not see any ships sunk or even hit, but you will see sailors receiving refreshing splashes of water from ""near misses."" The other funny thing about the air attacks is that there are lots of explosions but no planes. The sea battles are a little better; at least the mines, shells, and torpedoes hit actual targets. But the models for the ships look too much like bathtub toys.

The role played by Kirk Douglas, Captain Eddington, is odd. He's a very capable officer and Admiral Torrey's (John Wayne) most trusted man, yet he gets into a lot of petty trouble. But then, inexplicably, he gets into some real trouble when he rapes an ensign nurse on a public beach with lots of people on the other side of a sand dune.

There are many Soap Opera elements to this movie, and if you go in expecting and wanting that, then this movie is okay. The made-up names of the South Pacific islands for ""Operation Skyhook"" are quite amusing, too.",1219968000,4,1940,4.410614525139665

131816,4,0792102320,"In Harm's way is a rather interesting WWII film, to say the least. Released in 1965 but done in Black-&-White, the movie has a feel and look of a film much older. Although the beginning uses the historical bombing of Pearl Harbor as it's catalyst it is a fictional story.

Based on the bestselling novel by James Bassett, ""In Harm's Way"" follows a group of Navel officers and nurses in the early years of the war. Although the movie follows the book well it does tend to short-cut the plot somewhat. John Wayne plays Captain Rockwell (Rock) Torrey who is relieved of his command of his cruiser for taking two torpedos while ignoring standard navel ""zig-zagging"" policy. He ends up in a dead-end job of routing convoys. The story takes him from dispair to redemption as he earns a promotion to Rear Admiral and is assigned to take over a stalled offensive in the South Pacific. Although this is considered a ""War"" film it's really more about the characters and how they overcome their situations. Director Otto Preminger takes the time to develop all the main roles into very complex people.

What makes this movie great is the cast. Besides Wayne, Kirk Douglas plays Paul Eddington, a navel officer with many demons to overcome. The resolution of his character is very surprising for a 1965 film. Patricia Neal plays Maggie, a nurse who becomes involved with Rock and helps him overcome his dispair. Brandon de Wilde (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shane/dp/0792163710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shane</a>) plays the son Rock abandoned at age 4 who is now an Ensign in the Navy. Other notable actors: Burgess Meredith, Tom Tryon, Paula Prentess, Carroll O'Conner, George Kennedy, and in a small role, Henry Fonda.

What makes me rate this as four stars instead of five is the special effects. Even for 1965 some of the explosions and models look very fake. It's a small distraction while watching an exciting and/or intense scene, but it's there none-the-less. Although the attack on Pearl Harbor is done well and looks realistic, the final navel battle between Torrey's ships and the Japanese fleet is actually extremely unrealistic and fake looking. Again, even for 1965 standards. That is the only issue I have with ""In Harm's Way.""

But if you can get past the average special effects like I did you will find a great movie. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a strong storyline with great acting. In my opinion it's one of the top 10 WWII movies of all time!",1215216000,3,2526,4.9504716981132075

Many reviews here have gone over the plot and actors. I want to say that this movie, epic really, will satisfy those that love war movies. After awhile you won't notice its in B&W. It starts like no war movie I have recall seeing, a party with a drunk beauty making a scene. That scene pulls you in, its not the usual war movie.  Even the usual love sub-plots are a little more complex and unusual then most movies of the era.

131820,3,0792102320,"In Harm's Way is something of an oddity. Boasting a top director and an impressive all-star cast yet nearly completely forgotten, this 1965 roadshow would-be epic plays in many ways like a misfired follow-up to From Here To Eternity, following several navy men and their ladies from the attack on Pearl Harbor to the first American victories against the Japanese. But it's more soap opera than action movie, with John Wayne's legendary officer `The Rock' trying to work his way through the social circuit to get a new command after his ship takes a torpedo while pal Kirk Douglas goes off the rails after his unfaithful wife is killed, raping a nurse and eventually doing the decent thing. Throw in father-son reunions, hesitant affairs and the odd bit of infighting in the ranks and it's not too surprising that no-one has much screen time for the Japanese.

The casting is often curious - alongside top liners John Wayne (reunited with his Operation Pacific romantic interest Patricia Neal) and Kirk Douglas it's a mixture of the old guard - Henry Fonda, Burgess Meredith, Stanley Holloway, Dana Andrews, Franchot Tone, Bruce Cabot - and rising stars who never quite made it like Brandon DeWilde, Tom Tryon, Paula Prentiss, Barbara Bouchet and Jill Haworth. You can even glimpse the score's composer Jerry Goldsmith on piano in the opening scene of the movie as the leader of the band at a party.

The production values are extremely variable too. Preminger makes the most of the surprising amount of access he got from the US Navy to their ships and bases for some spectacular backgrounds, but the cast aside, there's often an air of cheapness to parts of the film; the cinematography often has a rough and ready available light look and the some of the interiors often look as if the filmmakers broke into people's houses while they were at work and stole a few shots without setting up the lights properly before they got back home. Widely ridiculed at the time for its bathtub battleship special effects (certainly not as bad as their reputation), the absence of any planes in the sky during the attack on Pearl is more of a problem, made all the more noticeable by the preponderance of low-angle shots that take in a clear sky in the sequence.

While there's no hiding that the film is in a disappointment considering all the talent involved, it does improve on a second viewing and with lowered expectations. It may never justify all the effort, but it fills a Sunday afternoon well enough.

One of the last widescreen epics shot in black and white, the DVD boasts a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with three enjoyably old-fashioned trailers introduced by Otto Preminger from the heart of a burning engine room or the deck of a P.T. boat, while the vintage making of featurette includes a quite charming outtake from one of Wayne and Neal's romantic scenes.",1196380800,,2866,4.807302231237323
131821,4,0792102320,"John Wayne, a USN captain, is at Pearl Harbor. He spots the approaching planes and, realizing that they don't fit the profile of American airplane maneuvers, orders an alert. This enables some of the attacking Japanese planes to be shot down.

Then the US naval fleet has to confront a larger Japanese naval force near an island that the US land forces want to seize from the Japanese. The Japanese naval fleet includes the huge battleship Yamato, whose armor is recognizably too thick to be readily pierced by US weapons, and which the Americans know will probably get through the battle.  Wayne notes that all soldiers would rather be at home but are forced into combat roles.

In the battle itself, the predawn Pacific is racked by the explosions of shells and torpedoes. The USN torpedo boats score impressive hits on the much-larger Japanese ships. But they also suffer heavy losses, and Wayne is among the casualties (wounded), and his son is killed. Will this encounter go down as a US victory, or defeat?

All along, Wayne has to contend with a rival naval commander. Ironically, an enemy propaganda broadcast (Tokyo Rose?) is regarded as providing a partially accurate portrayal of this rival's shortcomings.

Perhaps this movie is too long, and John Wayne is not as lively as he is in other movies. In the battle scenes, it is sometimes hard to tell which are the Japanese and which are the Americans. Otherwise, the action is riveting.",1195344000,4,1446,4.838056680161944

131885,5,0792102320,"This grand movie is a sound depiction of the early war in the Pacific. This movie was recently run on local TV. In spite of having bought the DVD earlier this year, and watching it several times, I still watched this TV version. It was released in 1965. Based on a very interesting story (that began on December 6, 1941), and many sub-stories, plus a superb cast, this film is worth seeing.

There were many useful reviews written on this movie. I particularly liked the customer review (#11) by a Ralph Couey. ""The movie demonstrates the difference between capable managers in peacetime and battle-worthy leaders in war. The U.S. was caught in that trap in the first year of World War II. Unfortunately, a lot of ships were lost and a lot of sailors died while the bureaucrats were weeded out and replaced with warriors."" This situation was essentially the basis for the ""battle"" between Rear Admiral Rockwell Torrey (John Wayne, surely one of his best roles) and Admiral `Blackjack' Broderick (Dana Andrews). Other reviewers described Broderick as weak and incompetent.

As I watched the TV show I couldn't help think there was a worthwhile analogy between the political events/strategic implications during this war and the political events/strategic implications  today and in our recent past.

What follows are some inputs from the movie.

1. The first scene reviewed here is between Torrey and Jere (Brandon De Wilde), his estranged son for the past 18 years. Torrey had just learned his son was on PT duty and he visited him. This first meeting was very strained. Some approximations of their conversation follow.
* Torrey - how do you like PT duty?
* Jere - I don't.
* Torrey - why did you chose it, it is a voluntary assignment?
* Jere - I knew this unit was assigned to Adm. Broderick, and once in this unit, I could be transferred to assist ex congressman Commander Neal Owen (Patrick O'Neal), Broderick's PR man. (Other reviewers described Owen as Broderick's stooge and a publicity seeking ex congressman, with political ambitions after the war). I will be his assistant.
* Torrey - that is just like your mother's family -  they could always pull political strings.
* Jere - Adm Broderick has been assigned to handle a very important (and supposedly very secretive) assignment - Skyhook. (Couey commented: ""Operation Skyhook represents Operation Watchtower, the drive to recover the Solomon Islands. The Battle of Pala Passage is in excellent representation of the second day of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, when Admirals Scott and Calahagn blocked a far superior Japanese force on its way to deliver the death knell to U.S. forces on the island"").
* Torrey - I wouldn't know about that. (About Skyhook)
* Jere - I wouldn't expect that you would. Commander Neal Owen gave me this information. (He should not have done that).
* Torrey - Somewhere in here Torrey commented he would like to throw his son to the fishes.
* Jere - why did you come?
* Torrey - let us just say that I did.
Later in the movie Jere discovers that Owen is a huge phony and his father is the real man. He ""quits"" Owen and is transferred back to PT duty, and ultimately a reconciliation with his father.

2. This is a luncheon scene between Owen and Jere, early in the movie.
* Owen - my job, Jere, is to see that the information given out to the press corp is good for the general war effort and good for the Navy.
* Jere - and good for Adm Broderick.
* Owen - well what is good for Adm Broderick is good for the war effort and good for the Navy.
* Jere - with a little left over for Neal Owen.

3. This scene is a dinner meeting to honor Torrey in his surprise promotion from Captain to Rear Admiral. The head of Pacific operations (Henry Fonda, who is perfectly cast in this role. He is undoubtedly playing Admiral Nimitz, but this is never defined.) makes this announcement, essentially bringing Torrey out of ""purgatory"" where he had been sent, unjustly, after Pearl Harbor. ""Nimitz"" noted that Lincoln had his George B. McClellan who was ""a great little organizer, but couldn't make up his mind when to fight"", and I have my Broderick. He went on: ""Indecision is a virus that can run through an army and destroy its will to win and even to survive."" (It seems to me that this is the kind of risk our country is being put in today in Iraq). Faced with this situation Lincoln called in Grant. And ""Nimitz"" noted: ""Torrey, you're going to be my Grant."" Broderick wasn't replaced, but Torrey was put in tactical command.
* Torrey - how far can I go?
* ""Nimitz"" - well you can't kill him, ""just get the job done.""

4. The next scene showed Broderick and Owens killing time waiting for Torrey's arrival.
* Broderick - I'm not going to take it.
* Owen - I don't think you should do anything hasty. If Torrey flops you can clearly point a finger at Cinc-Pac. If he wins, you're still the overall commander and will get most of the credit.
* Broderick - but I won't know what he is doing.
* Owen - you need a rep in Torrey's camp.
* Broderick - and you're it. You'll be my liaison officer.
* Owen - but I have no front line duty or experience.
* Broderick - now don't crawfish . It was you're idea. Besides a ""little forward area duty might be just the thing for you.

I noted above the superb cast. I would be remiss if I did not add inputs on one more character, Lieutenant Maggie Haynes (Patricia Neal)and a chief nurse. Both Torrey and Maggie are casualties of earlier, failed marriages. Their relationship blossoms while Torrey is still stuck behind a desk. Haynes is mature, supportive, and ""mission driven"" as she likes Torrey very much and wants him to know it. One reviewer felt Wayne was at his all time best in these scenes. I would say the same for Neal.

All in all a grand story, one that I can highly recommend.",1180483200,,6092,4.514052583862194

131888,5,0792102320,"John Wayne leads an all-star cast in this riveting drama about the American Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Wayne stars as Capt. (later Admiral) Rock Torrey.  He is put in command of a rag-tag fleet of ships to search for the Japanese fleet after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Kirk Douglas stars as Commander (later Captain) Eddington, Torrey's exec. officer.  Torrey's fleet finds the Japanese and a huge battle ensues.  A Japanese sub ends up putting two torpedoes into Torrey's ship, but the ship stays afloat.  Nevertheless, Torrey is relieved of his command for failing to sail in a zig-zag pattern.  (This sounds a lot like the saga of the USS Indianapolis).

Torrey is sent to work behind a desk after losing his command.  While ashore, he develops a relationship with Maggie Haynes (Patricia Neal), a navy WAVE.  He also tries to mend his strained relationship with his estranged son Jere (Brandon De Wilde).  Jere has developed a relationship of his own with a nurse named Annalee (Jill Hayworth).

Finally, after spending a considerable amount of time languishing behind a desk, Admiral Nimitz (Henry Fonda) gives Rock another chance.  He promotes Rock to Rear Admiral and sends him back into the South Pacific as commander of one of the first amphibious operations of the war.  Thanks to Rock's ingenuity and some help from his fellow officers, the operation is a success, but not without cost.

I found this to be a very good film.  The all-star cast is the strong point of the movie, with John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Patricia Neal, Tom Tryon, Brandon De Wilde, Burgess Meredith, Carroll O'Connor, Henry Fonda, Jill Hayworth, and Paula Prentiss all giving fine performances.  The battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the black and white backdrop of the film adds to the realism.  However, there are several sub-plots, such as Eddington's involvement with Annalee, which sometimes draw the viewer's attention from the main storyline.  But, these are minor, and in no way detract from the quality of the film.

I recommend this movie very highly.  John Wayne is at his best in this movie.  Although remembered mostly for his roles in Westerns, He made a large number of successful war movies as well, and this is one of his best.

The threatening morning of December 7, 1941--a quiet Sunday--is shattered by waves of Japanese planes bombing U.S Navy's base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, sending all its battleships to the bottom of the ocean... The scene is taken in brief, with few shots of airplanes and some explosions in the ocean...

Among the few ships that escape, in one piece, is the destroyer Cassidy protected by Lieutenant William McConnel(Tom Tryon).

Out on patrol, in high seas, a cruiser, commanded by Captain Torrey Rockwell (John Wayne), is having gunnery practice... It is this ship that serves as temporary operational headquarters for the survivors of the aerial attack...

Photographed in black and white, the film has several characters, most of them very mature and realistic...

Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas), a commander whose drunken wife (Barbara Bouchet) has committed adultery with a pilot (Hugh O'Brien). He relieves his anger by brutally raping a young nurse (Jill Haworth), and later, to save from being a total failure, defies orders by flying a reconnaissance plane and takes off alone to situate the hidden Japanese fleet in a very hazardous mission...

Egan Powell (Burgess Meredith), a sardonic wartime officer and a peacetime script writer who gives moments of sane observation, specially in a scene with Wayne discussing danger...

Patricia Neal, a mature and understanding Navy nurse who loves Captain Torrey and informs him that his son from whom he hasn't seen since for many years, is a naval officer on the island...

131944,4,0792102320,"Although an excellent film, Otto Preminger's ""In Harm's Way"" (1965) has never been one of my personal favorites; probably because the most interesting character, Commander Eddington (Kirk Douglas), inexplicably turns into sex maniac and must redeem himself with an extremely silly kamikaze gesture. Since you have a lot invested in the character, the sudden manifestation of mega self-destructive tendencies (both figurative and literal) cause the film to self-destruct along with his character.

The only positive about Eddington's downward spiral is that it allowed Preminger to give additional screen time to his ingnue Jill Haworth. Her Ensign Annalee Dorne character ranks near the top of cinema's all-time cuteness scale, a pleasant memory whenever one thinks about the film.

""In Harms's Way"" feels more like a film made just after the war than 20 years later. It begins extremely well with probably the best ""attack on Pearl Harbor"" sequences ever-in part because they are not the main thrust of the story and are not all that elaborate. Captain Rockwell Torrey's (John Wayne) is at sea when the attack begins and for him the biggest battle is political. With the help of politically savvy Commander Egan Powell (Burgess Meredith), and the moral support of a nurse from his generation Lieutenant Maggie Hayes (Patricia Neal), he weathers the accountability storm and eventually assumes a key command under Admiral Nimitz (Henry Fonda).

As noted above, Torrey's aide (Eddington) is never able to adjust to the death of his less than faithful wife (Barbara Bouchet). His main competition for Haworth's character is Captain Torrey's estranged son, nicely played by Brandon De Wilde although the physical differences between the two actors make it very hard to accept the parentage premise. Interestingly, their relationship and physical mismatch is virtually identical to Wayne's earlier one with actor Claude Jarman in John Ford's ""Rio Grande"" (1950). Both De Wilde (""Shane"") and Jarman (""The Yearling"") were famous child stars trying to transition to adult roles. De Wilde was killed several years after his ""In Harm's Way"" appearance.

The villain of the story (at least until Douglas becomes totally unglued) is Commander Neal Owen (Patrick O'Neal), a publicity seeking former congressman who has enlisted to serve as PR officer to incompetent Admiral 'Blackjack' Broderick (Dana Andrews).

Somehow Torrey eventually finds time to actually fight the Japanese.

Because ""In Harm's Way"" is often melodramatic soap opera rather than action adventure, Wayne gets a chance to really act and makes the most of it. It is arguably his all-time best performance, aided by Preminger's excellent acting for the camera direction and a very strong supporting cast that really challenged Duke to let it all go. His scenes with Neal are his all-time best.

Preminger and his editor get high praise for the film's pacing, inserting quality subplots (like the Tom Tryon and Paula Prentiss romance) to keep things moving along nicely. Not so praiseworthy are the special effects, which may in part account for the 1940's feel of the film. There is poor use of optical-printer effects and the ship models sit so high in the water that they betray all efforts to make them behave realistically.

There's an incredible panoply of recognizable stars including Slim Pickens, George Kennedy, Hugh O'Brien, Carroll O'Connor, Larry Hagman, and Stanley Holloway.

Of special note are appearances by both Barbara Bouchet and Jill Haworth, two of the most gorgeous actresses of the 20th century.

Paramount's DVD is not just widescreen glory (an excellent 16x9 B&W transfer) but has a considerable number of nice special features. A featurette with outtakes and three trailers.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1165363200,,3805,5.283112582781457
131945,5,0792102320,"As a Navy veteran, I have little tolerance for movies that don't take the time to be accurate in their depictions of military life in both peacetime and war.  Premminger took the time to get things right, which makes this movie an enjoyable tale.

Some reviewers declaim Wayne's portrayal of Admiral Torrey as stiff and without personality.  I disagree.  Captains and Admirals are by necessity stiff and formal, as is required by the tremendous responsibilities of their positions.  Shipboard friendships are rare because those friendships can interfere with the exercise of command, in particular, discipline.  Torrey demands, and gets the best from his subordinates.  But he has a soft spot for his friend, Eddington.  A tragic character with an alcohol problem, he would have been better served if Torrey had handled his second in command far more sternly.  Eddington respects Torrey in a way that he obviously respects no one else, especially himself.  He would have heeded that approach.  In many ways, Eddington represents the hopelessness of many career military officers in the peacetime of the 30's.  There were thousands of otherwise deserving officers who literally stayed the same rank for as long as 10 years.

The movie demonstrates the difference between capable managers in peacetime and battle-worthy leaders in war.  The U.S. was caught in that trap in the first year of World War II.  Unfortunately, a lot of ships were lost and a lot of sailors died while the bureaucrats were weeded out and replaced with warriors.

When in command of a ship or a task force in battle, the commander has to function with his intellect, not with emotions.  Keeping track of the conduct of a battle, when in the middle of that battle, requires a balance between detaching from the immediate surroundings and concentrating on the bigger picture.  Knowing what orders to give to the battle group while the flagship is being ripped to shreds around him is what determines who wins battles at sea.

Premminger really did his homework in establishing the environment.  Of particular note was the use of radio-controlled ship models during the battle sequences.  He didn't just use generic models, but was extremely accurate as to ship type and class.  For example, in one scene, a Japanese ship with three turrets forward and two aft is torpedoed by PT boats.  Flag Plot gets the report that a ""Mogami-class cruiser"" was hit.  Checking photo archives of World War II ships shows that the Mogami class was in fact designed in this way, in fact the only ship ever to have her main battery arrayed in that manner.  Also, the battleship Yamato is actually a model of the Yamato, accurate in every detail.  The main battery loading sequence on board Torry's cruiser is exactly what it should have been. This reality is enhanced by Premminger's use of actual Navy sailors as extras.  The actors even have Navy-regulation haircuts.

Yes, there are a multitude of sub-plots.  But I found them to be tasteful and reflective of what American culture was at that time.  I knew of many couples who talked about how important it was for that pregnancy to happen before the husband shipped off to war.  It was a time of great uncertainty, punctuated by the arrival of far too many of those ""damn yellow telegrams.""  Others who, in peacetime, might have been content to remain single, reached out to each other as a way of providing a buffer against an all-too-often brutal and fearful future.  And in one particularly important moment, a father and son reconcile a lifetime of bitterness and anger; a healing of deep emotional wounds.

In the end, Torrey is a man wracked by the loss of a son, close friends, and (he thinks) an important and pivotal battle.  CINCPAC II (as described in the credits) returns to Torrey his pride and self-esteem, and more importantly, a way to give meaning to his losses.

Any student of World War II will recognize the characterizations in this movie.  Franchot Tone, in the role of Husband E. Kimmel; Henry Fonda as Chester Nimitz; Wayne is probably William F. Halsey; Admiral Broderick represents Robert F. Ghormly.  Operation Skyhook represents Operation Watchtower, the drive to recover the Solomon Islands.  The Battle of Pala Passage is in excellent representation of the second day of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, when Admirals Scott and Calahagn blocked a far superior Japanese force on its way to deliver the death knell to U.S. forces on the island.  There actually was a destroyer that got underway and escaped the destruction inside Pearl Harbor, under the command of a Lieutenant Junior Grade, who also left his Commanding Officer behind in a small boat.

I have seen a lot (perhaps way too many) fictional movies using the Navy as the backdrop.  ""In Harm's Way"" is my favorite, mainly because the details are correct.  And it is the details that give the story context and believability.  The characters and performances are mostly accurate to the period.  The action sequences, somewhat hamstrung by the special effects technology of the time, is grimly accurate to the desperate sea battles that marked the Solomons Campaign.  Wayne is the quintessential Admiral, a man with partially-hidden flaws and weaknesses who nonetheless shines brightly when the day is darkest.

In the opinion of this Old Salt, there's no better movie around that tells the story of war and the people who fought in them.",1157500800,262,5433,4.945916114790287
131946,4,0792102320,"The director stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled... save for a couple of extras putting out an engine room fire in one case, manning a pair of chattering anti-aircraft guns in another.  The director is Otto Preminger, and he's seen - omnipresent, really - in a trio of trailers included on the IN HARM'S WAY dvd.  I'm a great fan of trailers.  They help get a handle on the movie.  They tell you what the movie's about - the story of the lives of survivors immediately following Pearl Harbor; introduce the big stars - John Wayne does the heavy lifting here, but this is an `epic' so there's a mess-and-a-half of co-stars; and introduce the newcomers - in this case the spotlight is on pretty young Barbara Bouchet, who Preminger appropriately enough describes as ""a new face, (pregnant pause) and a new body.""  Ms. Bouchet has a line of dialogue in the trailers that seems to have been cut from the final picture.  In any event, the new body doesn't do much but perform a slink dance with an umbrella pole, share a beach blanket and a good night's sleep with pickup Hugh O'Brien, and, most importantly, provide a reason for hubby Kirk Douglas to crawl into the bottle when he should be acting responsibly as Wayne's aide.

 Trailers are one thing, the movies they're hawking another.  After bathing in the Preminger pitches I figured this was going to be yet another variation of From Here to Eternity, uncomfortably mixing melodrama with a war action drama (right,) that the special effects were going to be good (right,) and that we were going to get a healthy dose of new-body Barbara Bouchet (wrong.)  Bouchet is just a slender, philandering plot device whose sole purpose is to cause hubby Kirk Douglas's chin dimple to furrow and to explain his dolorous alcoholism. After Wayne, the movie devotes most of its attention to the troubled and tragic character played by Douglas. It would have been better if they'd stopped there, but, this being an `epic' as defined in the mid-1960s, the plot is littered with annoying subplots concerning lesser stars - young naval officer Tom Tryon and fretful wife Paula Prentiss, resentful son Brandon De Wilde and his tease girlfriend Jill Haworth.  These co-stars lead us to soapy diversions that are well done, but... well, heck, if you're watching a John Wayne movie you wanna see Wayne emerge triumphant after being cashiered for sailing straight when he should have zigged and zagged, and caught a torpedo in the hull for his troubles.  Preminger must have liked the side stories, though.  In a couple of the trailers he inserts the scene when a freshly showered and betoweled Prentiss drags hubby Tryon onto the bed and pleads with him to `Leave me with a child this time.' Preminger might get the warms and fuzzies over lines like that, but I found them slightly embarrassing and overripe.

  Still, if you're a Wayne fan it's worth the three-hour investment in time.  Patricia Neal plays Maggie, a uniformed nurse who falls for the Rock (Wayne plays Capt. Rockwell Torrey.)  Neal's an excellent actress with a commanding presence, and she has a couple of scenes with Wayne that are touching and a lot more honest than anything Preminger gave to Prentiss and Tryon.  Douglas plays a complicated, flawed character who's given enough screen time to engage our attention and guarded affection. The action scenes are extremely well done, special effects state of the art for the time.  IN HARM'S WAY would be improved if it trimmed off about an hour's worth of fatty soap, but as it stands it's worth a moderately strong recommendation.",1157414400,,3598,4.7819063004846525

Preminger gave us all of the usual cliches, but seems to have been unaware of the importance, or even the existence, of the aircraft carrier.

131949,4,0792102320,"A very solid movie about the Navy in the first part of World War II.  This movie isn't particularly realistic, but if you hunt hard enough you can find some similarities to some of the real people and places.  Well, OK, Pearl Harbor is a real place - and it really looked like that - but you understand what I mean.  Yet, rather than retell history, I think Preminger was simply trying to tell a good story.

John Wayne plays a third generation Naval officer.  The type of guy who might say, ""If the Navy wanted me to have a personality, it would have issued me one and sent me to a school to use it.""  Thus, his main acting challenge is being stiff and ackward for most of the movie.  At the very end of the movie, he does an excellent job communicating his sense of loss and frustration.  For a second, I thought he was going to punch CINCPAC in the eye or cry like a girl.  Instead, he decided to take a nap.

Kirk Douglas plays one of the most unsavory characters you might imagine.  A failed aviator, a not particularly successful Naval officer with a cheating wife; one is tempted to feel sorry for him until he turns into a criminal.  An attempt at redemption is only sufficient to protect his name, not to earn glory.

The ex movie writer turned intelligence officer is meant to represent the ex musicians, mathematicians, and missionaries that formed a major portion of the intelligence effort at the Combat Radio Intelligence Unit, later Fleet Radio-intelligence Unit Pacific, and still later Joint Intelligence Center Pacific.  He does a good job showing that these were folks who were either really bad traditional Naval officers or folks from bizarre backgrounds.  What he fails to show is the heroic effort that these folks exerted.  While the staffs became quite large at the intelligence units, the very few folks who were either gifted at languages or cryptology often worked three or four days without sleep to achieve the great intelligence advantage that Nimitz later compared to an additional fleet.  But I digress.

I could go on and on about the other interesting characters and stories.  John Wayne's son.  John Wayne's love interest.  The ensign who got a battleship underway on 7 Dec.  The ensign's wife.  John Wayne's son's love interest.  There are a ton of sub-plots in this movie.

This movie will mean more to you if you know a lot about World War II in the Pacific.  You will keep trying to guess what ""real"" person each character might be modeled after or what battle actually had an event similar to the one you just witnessed.

It's sad to see this happen to an otherwise very distinguished movie.

It begins on the December 6th, 1941 and goes on from there.  This is NOT the 'shoot from the hip' type of John Wayne movie. John Wayne acts the part of the mature Captain/Admiral he portrays (much more convincingly than in The Green Berets'); down to the 'Survivor's Guilt'. It has ships, subs, airplanes, bombs, torpedoes, big guns, sailors, Marines, parachutes, spying behind enemy lines, suicide missions, romance, and everything that goes with them.

The scene in CINCPAC's private study right after CAPT Rock Torrey [Wayne] is promoted to Rear Admiral. CINCPAC [Henry Fonda] is rightfully impatient with Admiral Broderick [Dana Andrews], who is egotistical, but unwilling to decide to attack, much like Civil War Union General McClellan. CINCPAC recalls that Lincoln brought in a hard-nosed general named Grant who didn't care less about organization, he just pointed his battalions in the right direction, and he charged the enemy. The whole theme of the film is contained in CINCPAC's next line to Rock Torrey:

""You're gonna be my Grant!""

I also noticed that Director Otto Preminger briefly revisits his theme of an informant-plant as an in-house bad guy, a theme he covered more extensively with Peter Graves as the Nazi barracks spy in ""Stalog 17"".

The characters all have flaws, but each one rises to the occasion when the war calls on them to give their best. Rock Torrey does not waste a second driving straight into battle, no matter how impossible the odds! This is the classic stuff of Hollywood Magic and also of inspiration!

Buy this DVD! There is inspiration in this old film, and as with the good old Duke, the actors capture all the best things about taking brave risks and decisive action when in harm's way.

On any level you want, ""In Harm's Way"" delivers!",1105228800,14,1886,4.722560975609756

When I saw that Otto Preminger directed this film, I just had to see it, easily understood if you've read any of my other reviews.  I didn't know this film would be about Pearl Harbor and the beginnings of the Pacific naval campaigns.  The cast is spectacular, although I don't know some of the main actors' names other than Fonda, Douglas or O'Connor.  Jill Haworth, I knew of from Preminger's Exodus.  Poor  girl, bad things always happen to her in Preminger's films.  The last half was most suspenseful for me.  The sea battles looked real to me, but I'm not military.  I was most moved by Paula Prentiss' character as Bev McConnell, especially when, in the middle of her military work, receives from ""Rock"" (John Wayne) the news that her husband, Mac, is MIA.  The story was based on a book of the same name by James Bassett; the movie realistically depicts the losses and courage of the men and women, at all levels, of our armed forces.",1099094400,2,1012,4.535911602209945

How he had to wait until the 70's for an Academy Award, speaks volumes to exactly what is wrong with Hollywood and the Acadamy voting process.  If you are are fan of JW or the WWII genre movies, you must buy this DVD.  If I had to find anything wrong with the movie, it would be the directors use of model ships to simulate the battle scenes.  With the cast in this movie, you would think that they could have pony'd up a little cash for some stock WWII Pacific naval footage.  That being said, THIS MOVIE ROCKS!  BUY IT NOW!

It deals with several substantive issues (i.e. love, loss, rape, death, etc.) that are dveloping in people's lives at the same time as the war.  Interestingly, I felt like a voyeur as I was watching the movie due to an intimate/personal filming perspective and excellent acting.

John Wayne is the star and the supporting cast is strong. Patricia Neal and Kirk Douglas are standouts. In spite of the superior acting and the efforts of Otto Preminger as director, the film never quite achieves the same level of interest as MIDWAY which is definitely a better motion picture.

132025,5,0792102320,"Director Otto Preminger made a good war movie, here.  John Wayne plays the part of a captain who initially loses his ship, but comes back eventually as a commodore (1 star admiral).  Kirk Douglas is his Exec, Cdr. Ettinger (eventually a captain), who has a bottled up violence in his character (well played).  Patricia O'Neal plays a navy nurse (Lt.), Dana Andrews plays an egotisitcal admiral, and Henry Fonda plays CincPac.

The picture is well cast.  Even a young Carroll O'Conner has a part, and Burgess Meredith plays an intelligence officer very well.  Brandon De Wilde (a new name to me) plays Wayne's son, a spoiled college brat brought up by his mother, also well-played.

I was impressed by the details in the movie, including the plane's designations (except for a reference to an AT6 ""Texan,"" which they should have called by its navy designation, an SNJ, instead of the air corps desgnation), and the Japanese ship designations.  The battleship Yamato, for example, was identified as having 18-inch guns, as indeed it did have--larger than the 16-inch rifles on America's battle-wagons.

All together, it was a well-told story which held pretty much to reality, except for the fictional islands' names and the presence of so many females that close to the action.

I enjoyed it, as I do most old Wayne movies.  And Otto Preminger knew how to put them together.

I've read some negative reviews here, but mine isn't one of them.  It is a soap-opera, but who cares? Some of the best movies have been soap-operas, but they always work.  There is enough in IN HARMS WAY to satisfy on many levels.  I am delighted that it has finally been released in a WideScreen format for the first time for home video.  Otto Premminger and Co. knew exactly what they were creating: a good story, with charactres audiences could care about.  I agree that the B/W photography was a good choice.  I recall reading somewhere that Kirk Douglas was not happy with the final navy battle sequence, and you can easily spot the models, but the energy in the pacing of the editing keeps you engrossed, and you willingly suspend your disbelief in some of the cheap special effects (such as when a door supposidly blows open, but which you can tell is a post-production effect).

132027,5,0792102320,"I have been a fan of this film for over 20 year. I am surprised to see that this movie has received so many negative reviews. When I want to watch a movie about the attack on WWII and or the Pearl Harbor attack and want to see accurate historical information I'll watch a movie like TORA! TORA! TORA! (TTT). If I want to be entertained I'll watch a movie like IN HARMS WAY (IHW). While I did like TTT and the fairly accurate telling of the events that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor as well as the attack itself it did not have character development. IHW used fictitious names and some fictitious locations but the story was based on real events. I really enjoyed the character development.
I think John Wayne gave one of his best performances in this film. The only one that might have been better was his role as a dying gunslinger in The SHOOTIST. His character was not the standard head strong hero that takes on the odds and triumphs but rather one of an aging man who is trying to make the best decisions he can. Not all are the correct decision and he sustains some failures. He also is hurt in this film. I mean hurt to the point of hospitalization. Not something we see in many John Wayne films.
Kirk Douglas gave a fine performance. It is hard to decide if you like him or if you don't. He is a man who has mastered his navy duties while at the same time unable to manage his personal emotions. The look in his eyes during the rape scene is one that will make you wonder if Kirk Douglas wasn't a little to comfortable with the role. Kind of like Kathy Bates in MISERY or Anthony Perkins in PSYCHO. When an actor can play a psycho so convincingly it makes me wonder if they might be a little psycho themselves.
The effects are not the best but they are not the worst either. I think the black & white (b&w) works to the films advantage here. If filmed in color I think the scenes involving screen projections would have looked even more phony. Think of the Beach Party films made around this same time.
So, if you want to be entertained and enjoy WWII movies this one will deliver. In my opinion it is better than MIDWAY and far more better than the horrible PEARL HARBOR (2001) film.
Lastly, as far as the DVD is concerned it is okay. It has 3 trailers that are almost identical. The documentary is shallow. It does not really go behind the scenes and is more like an 8 minute trailer. The image and sound are okay and except for the widescreen format not that much better than the VHS version. I am a big fan of DVD's that have a commentary option when viewing the film. There are still enough of the actors alive today to make a commentary or at least a good documentary.",1052179200,8,2686,4.258317025440313

The answer is that I think that ""In Harm's Way"" captures the spirit of the American Navy in World War II in a near perfect way; it shows flawed men and women trying to do their best under appalling conditions. It also shows the backstabbing and deceit that occasionally marked the rivalry between some commanders. Some parts drag a bit, but the overall effect, for me, is a movie that I have (and will) watch over and over. Despite its age, it spins a good yarn; the characters are believeable and interesting. Wayne has delivered many fine performances (think ""The Quiet Man"", ""The Searchers"" and John Ford's cavalry trilogy) and his portrayal of Admiral Rockwell Torrey is one of them. In his committment to the Navy, his growing love for Nurse Maggir Haynes, and his conflict with his son, Wayne is at his top form. Neal, in her post stroke first appearance is equally good. OK, the use of poor models to represent naval ships is off-putting, but it's the characters and the story that captures the viewer.

Forget special effects and violence for ratings sake, this film strikes a tone still applicable today. The politics seem to be right out of modern situations. (but as much as we might like to, we won't slap an ex-congressman to get his political rear-end out of the way).
Modern Air Force Officer training uses a scene from this movie as an ethical training situation... You only have 10 assigned airplanes, but you need 15, and you will only be issued replacements from the reserves in the case of a mechanical breakdown. What can you do? Kirk Douglas has one solution, and I know of one real-life guy who broke up with his Air Force girlfriend after wrangling over this very scenerio.
Happy ending? You decide. People die, in fact, just about everyone. War, sex, death, love ,suicide, rape... I still felt good when the final waves crashed onto the beach.

This movie focuses on the effects of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on the career of one naval officer, played by John  Wayne, and people close to him.  JW is caught initially by the backlash  effects of the debacle at Pearl Harbor and a nation's need to place  blame.
As a result JW finds himself ashore, rather than at sea where he  longs to be.  But as a career naval officer he does his duty.  His  potential is eventually realized, and he is given a field assignment where  he excels.
The character development is great, and relationships between  the principles is excellent, especially between Wayne and his on-screen  son.
This movie has heroism and love, loss and tragedy.  To me the  defining point in the movie occurs when JW's on-screen son realizes what's  important to his father, and, consequently, to him.

132133,4,0792102320,"So many movies have been made about the land war in WWII. What about the US Navy? The only ones of any merit were made during the war or in its aftermath and most were unbalanced, showing the Japanese as the  ""yellow peril,"" etc. I was raised on these movies and some of our  best directors cranked them out (John Ford and many others) and few stand  up well the test of time. Quite by accident I caught up to this fine film  on TV and then on this fine double video. The performances by the actors  are excellent. John Wayne shows facets of his character that I never saw  before, a vulnerabilty rarely seen other than the classic western ""The  Searchers,"" probably his best career performance. Kirk Douglas  delivers a great performance of a naval officer with an underlining  violence of character, which proves fatal to him. A fine supporting cast  headed up by Patricia O'Neil, Burgess Meredith, Tom Tryon and others fills  out the story, spread on a broad canvas by Otto Preminger. I was flat out  surprised by this excellent work, full of details, character developement,  and action. This really isn't an action picture, with high heroics and flag  waving. By subduing these elements, a temptation for any director to boost  box office, Preminger achieves effects not seen in most big-budget  productions. The story is somewhat slow but rarely boring. The B&W  photography posed no problem for me,for most of the war movies I saw as a  child were filmed in B&W and it somewhat adds to the documentary look  of the movie. Almost all war movies use ""stock"" footage of ships  and battles and this movie is no different. The use of models in the  climactic battle is not very convincing; I read that Kirk Douglas said that  he liked the movie but seeing all those models with no crewmen standing on  deck bothered him, detracked from the power of the film. Jerry Goldsmith's  score is rousing without being bombastic, similar to his great  ""Patton"" score, another movie with some action but has great  emphasis on character. I would recommend this to all of John Wayne's fans.  Watch carefully; the Duke is showing some real acting talent here,  restrained for an officer named ""Rockwell."" With so many epics  going for the blood and guts approach, ""In Harm's Way"" comes  sailing past with a more balanced picture, that the war was harsh, fought  by men, lower to upper ranks, but just men of flesh and blood, caught up in  the defining event of the twentieth century.",948326400,100,2472,4.68997668997669
132134,5,0792102320,"In Harm's Way is a tremendous WW2 Navy yarn told by the best actors of it's day. Parts of the movie are slow and predictable plus the special effects are '60s technology, but I don't have any problem letting go and  being totally absorbed by the story.  The sense of drama that builds during  the night attacks leading up to the final battle is absolutely intense.  The great plot and stellar performances by the supporting cast make the  experiance even richer.  P.S.  Yes to a letterboxed version, NO TO  COLORIZED. I'm not a reactionary about colorizing movies, but don't forget  this movie was made in 1965! Hello, if they had wanted it to be in color  they would have made it in color.",948326400,8,690,4.536585365853658
