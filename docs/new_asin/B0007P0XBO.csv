2224903,1,B0007P0XBO,"Do you get the feeling that these movies are only strung together from the cast's ""pranking"" and ""joshing"" sessions from ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT and ACCESS HOLLYWOOD?

Like THE CANNONBALL RUN and the abominable CHARLIE'S ANGELS films, these movies look like they were far more fun to make than to actually watch.",1102464000,6,310,5.2
2224904,2,B0007P0XBO,"Lets face it...

Ocean's Eleven was a very weak movie. Great cast yeah...but...(this usually happens) did any of the BIG stars get more than 10 min on the film?

Too expensive? Yes, of course having Academy Award winner Julia Roberts on screen for more than 10 min would cost a fortune but hey, you're making a BIG movie with BIG stars, so spend SOME money on it!!! Or just don't put her/his name first of all in the Trailer, making it appear like she/he's the main character...

Yes, the movie was entertaining, but the story was really appalling and the development didn't take much...

Just hope 12 is better than 11...",1102032000,2,622,4.576576576576577
2224905,5,B0007P0XBO,I LOVED the first movie. The cast is absolutely perfect to work together. I can't wait to see the sequel. I feel it is going to be good. The first one was way better than the original with the rat pack. I think this group of actors won't let us down. Just Remember 12*10*04 it comes out and I will be there to see it.,1092614400,,317,3.8923076923076922

2224908,3,B0007P0XBO,"Lots of vocabulary and phraseology that only the 'cool kids' will grasp. Having never been deemed 'cool', I missed alot. Every plot twist is well telegraphed, though. No surprises there. The surprise is why so much schmaltz? As usual, the original (O'11) is far better.  If only I was a bit more edgy, I might like this movie.",1505174400,,326,4.620689655172414
2224909,1,B0007P0XBO,Bad movie.  Save your time and watch Oceans 11 again.  This one takes all the weak points of the first movie and stretches them out for two hours.  Not worth you time.,1504310400,,167,4.15625

2224914,1,B0007P0XBO,"Started out okay, but script-wise it felt like a cheap rip-off from Ocean's Eleven.  It felt like right in the middle of the movie, the movie decided to not care about the audience and I lost all interest.  I felt like the movie completely lost all sense of suspense, drama, charisma, and finally, towards the end, it lost all appeal.  I am sure that we all expected more from so many stars.",1500768000,,391,4.402777777777778
2224915,1,B0007P0XBO,"To me this movie was empty; like it was made just to show Brad Pitt, who is overrated, give shy smiles.  Weak.",1500163200,,110,4.0
2224916,2,B0007P0XBO,I thought this was part of Prime. No charge. Movie not nearly as good as Oceans 11. I would not have gotten it if it did not say PART OF YOUR PRIME.,1500163200,,148,3.65625

2224926,3,B0007P0XBO,"Lots of beautiful, famous people.  The movie holds your interest overall, but it was slow in many parts.  The movie got pretty bad when Julia Roberts' character pretends to be Julia Roberts. That was very tedious and not funny.  I have to say Julia Roberts did not look charming or attractive in this movie, either.",1497744000,,315,4.6909090909090905

2224935,2,B0007P0XBO,This movie was stupid and so why am I even wasting my time on a review.  It won't make it better.,1496966400,,97,3.619047619047619
2224936,3,B0007P0XBO,"The story and the acting are great. It's the music score that was bad. I'll admit at first I though the score was interesting and it was obvious the director was going for a certain feel and charm with it. After a while it wasn't interesting anymore. Then It got in the way. Ultimately It gave me a headache. And I am a fan of movie musical soundtracks. Where music adds to the visual and emotional impact. However, I give Oceans 12  three stars because I did NOT like the soundtrack. I have never given a so so star rating because of a sound track but, the score took away from my being able to enjoy the movie.

This is my opinion. Yours may differ. Peace.",1496966400,2,658,4.214285714285714

2224944,2,B0007P0XBO,"You know, it's just okay. Not something I would watch again. The character interaction just seems fake, with the exception of the Bruce Willis cameo as Bruce Willis - he's about the only genuine thing about this mess. The plot is clear enough: they have to repay Andy Garcia for ripping him off, so they plot to steal something or other. Then things get convoluted. Honestly, I'm not even sure what they did in Amsterdam to that house, but it involved jazzy music and flashy colors and stuff. Yeah.
Then they steal an expensive egg, or at least appear to, then get arrested, but then they get rescued, then... oh gosh, it was just a mess. The more I started thinking about it, I downgraded to a 2 star review from 3 simply because I couldn't tell what was going on half of the time. And what kind of stupid ending to the film was that, anyhow? Was the french guy going to reappear and do something? Er, nope, film was over. Whatever.",1486339200,,933,4.398843930635838

2224966,1,B0007P0XBO,"Ocean's Eleven, a true masterpiece...Interesting, action packed, and it has a cast that could not have been more well put together.
However, This piece of trash is nothing and I mean nothing compared to that.
First off, half of the movie was completely irrelevant. More than half of the content shown didn't follow a storyline.
Also, every time something was stolen, it was unclear and even the explanation of how it was stolen was unclear. And what are they celebrating at the end?? How they all got caught?? Right. I literally skipped some parts of this because it was moving so slow. What an awful movie, I should have read the comments first.",1480118400,,646,4.725663716814159

Everything in the film from the cinematography to the performances to one of my all time favorite soundtracks is top notch. Kudos to the makers and producers for taking a chance and making a SMART film. Unfortunately, it's been marginalized by a dumbed-down American public. Perhaps if the makers had thrown in a couple fart jokes, a love scene with some nudity and a couple action sequences, this film would have received better reviews.

2225132,5,B0007P0XBO,"The storyline was a little stretching of credulity but the execution was Steven Soderbergh's usual brilliance. There were two things I especially liked. First the geographic scope. I love movies and stories that flit from place to place, and O-12 doesn't disappoint. From East Haven (actually shot in Lake Forest IL) to Amsterdam, to Lake Como, to Rome, to Paris, and the Riviera, and not to mention Vegas, I loved it.

The second thing was how well the movie rode the line between taking it self too seriously and devolving into complete farce. It was a joy to see the fun the actors clearly had wearing their now familiar characters and nowhere more so than with those really priceless lines. When Matt Damon's character seeks clarification from Julia Roberts' character who says what she's having to do is ""Just wrong"", his delivery of ""You mean...morally?"" is perfect. Or when Elliot Gould asks of the fortune teller, ""This? You couldn't see this?""

I never saw these movies until recently.  I am writing this review, with just having finished watching 12.
This movie has been criticized with other reviews,  perhaps because it's a sequel, which are never widely accepted.  But I also feel it may be resting on the shoulders of the original 1960 film (which never has a sequel), instead of the remake.  People don't like tampering with an original, especially if there's a sequel.  The original then becomes lost and unimportant.  I get it.
But...this is a great movie!  It's fun, well written, takes place in Italy (like a great spy movie - even a refence to Bond in it!), and full of twists!  I was confused til the end!  But what a great movie!  Really!  Not to mention David Holmes captured the essence of the original film with his retro sounding lounge/spy music, which enhanced the movie greatly!  Love, love, love it!

The premise is at least believable - the casino owner tracks them down and gives them choice between a dirt nap or paying him back.  The cast still work well together, and I found the two French thieves an interesting subplot.  What I did not find amusing - in fact I found it to be rather boring - was Zeta Jones whole role in the movie (it was a little too close to Entrapment) and the whole long embarrassing section with Julia Roberts pretending to be herself in the museum, which just went on far, far too long.  Bruce Willis' cameo was well done, but it wasn't nearly enough to save that whole section of the move (that what the fast forward button on the remote is for).

But there's nothing more to it. It was definitely a lazy sequel that tried to capitalize on the success of the first movie as it provides nothing original and it has a thin and somewhat illogical screenplay.

2225214,2,B0007P0XBO,"Okay, lets do this one by the numbers. Not in numerical order because as I have noted in reviewing Oceans 13 and then the granddaddy Oceans 11 (modern version, no the 1960s Frank Sinatra and pals classical) in that order there is not such sequencing here. What I mean by the numbers here in this last of the trilogy to be reviewed is the number of heists that it takes this time in Oceans 12 to get square. See in 11 and 13 the crew just did one big caper and done, hitting the casinos in Vegas (we definitely can forget the Las Vega moniker since we are more than honorary citizens after three films) just for the sake of doing it or to help an old comrade out. Here there are several capers that did not seem to connect together and, frankly, there were too many moving parts to try to hold this immediate sequel together.

Here is the problem. We know from 11 that Danny (played by George Clooney of course) and the boys took a big haul, over 150 million from three casinos in Vegas from one multi-billionaire owner Terry Bennett (played by Andy Garcia). But old Terry did not get where he was in the world by being beaten up six ways to Sunday by a bunch of unconnected independent street hoods. And thus Terry must seek revenge (not to mention that he lost his girlfriend, Dannys ex , played by Julia Roberts, back into Dannys arms) and so strong-arms the guys into paying every cent taken plus interest.

Of course street guys naturally have already spent a good portion of the dough one way or another and so under a two week time limit set by Terry to get each and every dollar back (plus interest) the boyos must go back to work.

You can tell that the actors just really like working together.  I have a couple of questions though, even though I have seen the film several times, there are things I apparently miss, and thought maybe someone could help me out. First, in regard to Linus' mother being the head of whatever international security organization she was with, how could she know that Linus was part of Ocean's gang, and not only not do anything about it but get them all out of jail? How could she aid and abet her son? Was she lying about being the Section Chief?  The other question is similar, in regard to Isabel. She forged the arrest warrant for all of them, and got caught, yet there were no legal repercussions for her.

Since I haven't seen ""Lost in Translation,"" what did Matsui do to Linus?

How in the world did Yen breathe in that bag for two days, and didn't he ever have to relieve himself? I also missed the reason he had to be sent in the bag in the first place. I really have seen the film, but I miss this stuff.  The look on Danny's face when he walks into the hotel room and Yen is literally bouncing off the walls in his freedom, food everywhere, and Danny can't say anything, is a great moment.",1376352000,,1368,4.246153846153846

Amsterdam and Rome aren't fancy enough for you? Wondering why Catherine Zeta-Jones is even in the movie -- are you kidding? The addition of that character is a major plot point, and if you don't know how she ended up in the movie, you must have been off getting your popcorn during the first several minutes of the film.

This is a nice follow-up to Ocean's Eleven, following the characters several years later as their Bellagio heist catches up with them. The addition of some complicating personal factors (a detective girlfriend, a competitive thief) twist the plot a little more. I'll admit I watched this movie more than once to untangle all the myriad plot points, but then I'm easily distracted and enjoy watching movies repeatedly anyway.

The acting and writing is stellar, featuring the same kind of rapid, talk-over dialogue as the first film, with priceless banter especially between the George Clooney and Brad Pitt characters. You feel like you're in the room with these guys as they concoct their elaborate schemes.

Ocean's Twelve is every bad sequel you ever saw, rolled into one. The basic problem is that there isn't really much of a plot, nothing is ever explained, and it's all just a vague bunch of nonsense. The camera work is annoyingly and gratuitously artsy at entirely inappropriate moments, and the whole thing feels like an overly long TV sitcom.

Matt Damon's character becomes even more milquetoast like. Clooney's character becomes even stupider in love with Roberts' character, who becomes even more entitled. It's really maddening.

It was interesting to see the various parts of Europe included in the script. The story was a total failure, however. It was overly long long and confusing. Boring is a good word that comes to mind. What were they thinking? The follow-up to ""Oceans 11"" was a dud! It just didn't match up. There's no use in wasting any more electrons on this subject. If you're interested in the Oceans series of films, The ""Oceans 12"" is a dud. Save your money.

Ocean's Twelve is a totally different beast. You spend the entire movie waiting for it to start making sense, and you never really care about any of the characters or relationships. There's never a feeling of danger, and therefore, never any excitement. Once you think you know who the villain is and what needs to be done, the villain becomes absent for most of the movie, and they don't end up doing what you thought they were supposed to do.

By the time the credits role, you feel like you've gained nothing from the movie, and just watched a shadow of the original. It leaves you feeling like no one who worked on the original was involved in the sequel and begs the question ""why didn't anyone raise their hand and object to this?""

2225427,1,B0007P0XBO,"Quick Summary:

Imagine if the Ocean's crew were dropped, without explanation, into a non-comedic version of the old Pink Panther movies, while the director tried to pretend that it hadn't happened.

Full version:

After the success of the excellent Ocean's Eleven, the studio was under pressure to quickly capitalize on it. They needed a sequel, and they needed one NOW. Unfortunately, writing a good screenplay takes time, so they decided to adapt an existing one. Someone tracked down a decent script involving an ensemble cast of thieves, and a team of writers hastily swapped the Ocean's crew in instead and added some ties to the first film.

The result? A film that feels like what it is -- a patchwork, overdone monstrosity. The plot makes no real sense -- the action is easy enough to follow but the characters' motivations don't make any sense. The ending has two ""big reveals"", one of which you see coming from a mile away. The other... is one of those twists that you don't see coming only because there was never once a hint of foreshadowing. One that has to ""cheat"" by being completely hidden, because if they had even hinted at it (like with a good twist), you would've seen THAT one coming as well.

All in all, a clunky mish-mash of attempted action, attempted suspense, attempted comedy, and bad plot twists. Save your money and skip right from Ocean's Eleven to Ocean's Thirteen. You won't regret it, and you don't need to know a thing about this movie to understand it. (Well, okay, ONE thing -- the stereotypical French burglar makes a cameo in 13 near the end. Now that you know that, you won't be wondering, ""Who is that guy?"" Now please, skip this movie.)",1259452800,2,1679,4.697278911564626

2225429,1,B0007P0XBO,"I still have nightmares about it: I was in the theater. It was around late January, and the options were few, so my brother and I picked ""Ocean's 12."" My therapist tells me I will get over my condition one day but it will take a lot of work.

Here's what Hollywood did: ""We have some money and we need something to fill the post-holiday gap. Any unnecessary sequels need making? Ocean's 12? Let's do it. Come on, this is a sequel. We don't even need a script. Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Roberts will just wander around Amsterdam until a plot gels somehow.""

And the deus-ex-machina ending was so bad I couldn't believe the actors and writers ever agreed to it. It proves my point that no one involved cared about this movie from the start.

All the characters were interesting and there is still enough development in all of them that allowed us to learn more about each one of them, well maybe not the Chinese guy or Frank.

The soundtrack is amazing and the part where Toulour uses his skills to steal the egg was excellent.

I had to watch it twice before I can really appreciate the one liners, subtle plot twists, etc.

I am surprised by the negativity from most of the reviewers, but I think this movie can only really be appreciated by fans of the TV shows 24 or Lost.",1241395200,5,642,4.378151260504202
2225432,4,B0007P0XBO,"I saw Ocean's Eleven, reluctantly, and fell in love.  It opened the door for me to be able to tolerate George Clooney and Brad Pitt (although 12 Monkeys and Fight Club continue to be his best work).  That being said, Twelve was NOT Eleven.

This does not make it bad, just different.  The difference though being a rather large one.  Instead of one tremendously clever caper, we have three blase ones with alot of down time in between.  And herein is where I think alot of people torched this film.  They wanted to see the exact same genius of the first script and instead got Ocean and crew palling around Europe.  This film is by no means a mind buster, but it IS an enjoyable film with some rather entertaining times and the same type of story one would expect the writers to come up with for this crew.

All in all, not the best one out of the group, but I challenge anyone who bashed this film for not being as good as the first one to give me a series of films that consistently IMPROVED upon itself.  There have been A LOT of letdown sequels out there, I would not go so far as saying this one was a letdown.  Eleven was 5 stars........this one is four, for simply being a fun film as long as you can sit back and not start making Ocean's Eleven comparisons.  Sure it bears the namesake, but it is NOT the same film.  And honestly, it does a great job showing just how clever Terry Benedict can be as the villain.  One of Andy Garcia's best roles, albeit short lived.

I got to apologize for reviewing the film itself instead of the product, but I honestly felt this was being unfairly represented by alot of the reviews.  Hope this helps give some counterpoint.  And FYI, the disk is great I simply wish it had a little more meat.  Not alot in the way of extras",1231632000,31,1769,4.261261261261262
2225433,3,B0007P0XBO,"The Bottom Line:

Though the caper aspects of Ocean's Twelve are rather dissapointing, the amusing character interaction, several hilarious scenes, and an inspired gag involving Julia Roberts make this film worthy of a tepid recommendation.",1229472000,,240,5.857142857142857
2225434,2,B0007P0XBO,"The thing is, I should have known this was going to happen, and in a way I did.  I mean, I've been vocal about not getting into `Ocean's Eleven' and I just had this horrible feeling that this movie was going to be just as bad.  I never imagined that it would be worse, but `just as bad', yes.

The whole concept behind the original film was taking a bunch of highly recognizable stars and throw them into a fast paced (albeit brainless) caper of a film where they got to be funny (sort of) and interact on a very personal level with one another, hopefully to engage the audience and make a lot of money.  The problem was that not one of the actors could live up to their own hype.  George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts...all actors who are genuinely charming and interesting and engaging, yet together at this magnitude they were lukewarm at best.  The problem with `Ocean's Twelve' is that they repeat the same ineffective formula, adding only layers of confusion and stupidity to spice things up.

I can't even really begin to explain to you what they are trying to pull off here, but I'll attempt it.  The gang is all back, except this time they are stealing money to save their lives since Terry Benedict (the guy they robbed in the first film) has found them all and tells them if they don't pay back what they stole with interest then they are dead men.  They flee to Amsterdam to try their hand and getting back the money but there is a thief called the Nightfox who is one step ahead of them the entire way.  Seems that he sit he one who tipped off Benedict as to their whereabouts because he felt threatened by Ocean's success and wanted to prove once and for all that he was the better thief.

Add to the mix Rusty's (that's Pitt) former flame Isabel Lahiri, who has an agenda all her own, and you have a slightly confusing, rather bland and boring answer to the mess they handed us in 2001.

I really wanted this to be so much better than it was.  I thought that maybe the spark they were missing in `Ocean's Eleven' would be found after these years went by and they might bring something fresh and exciting to the table, but this atrocity if far worse than the original.  Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, Garcia, Zeta-Jones, Caan, Affleck, Cheadle (who fares better than anyone else) and especially Damon are all just boring.  There is no natural charm in these actors.

Honestly, aside from one hilarious scene where Tess pretends to be Julia Roberts in order to complete a heist and is accosted by Bruce Willis, the film almost put me to sleep.  That one scene saved the film a bit.

I have yet to attempt the third film (it's been sitting on my DVR for months now) but I will soon.  I'm not looking forward to it, but I would feel incomplete if I didn't at least give it a try.  I want to give this movie an F because I was so furious with its lack of real effort, but I'm going to settle for a D, maybe D-.  The film is dreadful in scenes, but Roberts elevates the whole film with three minutes of pure unadulterated charisma, and for that I am grateful.",1223596800,,3065,4.342105263157895
2225435,3,B0007P0XBO,"A lack of pretension can cover a multitude of sins- even the lack of a plausible script. Such is the premise that Ocean's Twelve, the sequel to Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven remake of the Rat pack classic 1960s caper film, must have been pitched at studio executives with. Simply put, never has a film about less, with less characterization and more smug mugging for the camera ever worked better. There were a plethora of such films in the 1960s, both American and European, and even Japanese, but none with the star power this film has. Style, on very rare occasions, can trump substance, and this film is that exceptional one that proves that substance usually is king.
  Ok, what of the plot? In the first film Danny Ocean (George Clooney)and his crew stole $160 million from the casino of a big time casino owning mobster named Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). This film opens three years later, with all eleven thrives hunted down and given a deadline with which to pay back the money with interest, or die. Of course, there are plot holes galore. The whole set up is untenable, and the fact that such smooth operators would so easily expose themselves is ridiculous. Still, there are some really funny scenes of Bernie Mac in a massage, Rusty (Matt Damon) as a lap dog, and assorted other funny scenes. Only Ocean manages to escape such a threat- but not for long, as he re-teams with the others to make things right....What I find amazing is how many reviewers panned this film. It reminded me of the roasting the 1998 Hollywood version of Godzilla got; as if a film about a big lizard stomping on New York would or should have been Oscar caliber? This is why I started off talking about pretense, and its ability to salvage potentially bad films. In this case, it works, and so does the film. Now, if Ocean's Thirteen were smart it would just focus all on Ms. Jones. Sometimes pretense has its charms!",1221436800,,1912,4.6371681415929205

Lots of talent in the cast, with the exception of Brad Pitt of course, who continues to embarrass himself, and us, with his impersonation of an actor.  Having so much recognizable talent on screen is very distracting from the story, which is unfortunate, since there is no story worthy of the name.  The script, if one may use such a lofty term to describe it, is simply wretched - some scenes contain dialog that is truly cringe-worthy.  The producers of this bloated catastrophe have attempted to cover its sheer vacuousness with lavish production value, lots of dressy location photography in swish European hot spots, and Hollywood ""in jokes"" like Julia Roberts doing a bad impression of Julia Roberts - which when you think about it - is all she ever does.

The director shows not a grain of respect for the intelligence of a common viewer and just keeps parading actors on the screen talking nonsense, doing improbable and in the end achieving impossible.

If all this would have been infused with some self-deprecating wit and humor *maybe* it could have been viewable (just maybe). But being soaked with actors' love of themselves and disregard for the character they are supposed to embody, it is painful to look at. There is more good acting and dialog when these stars walk the red carpet on Oscar nights and talk to Joan Rivers than in this movie.

2225448,3,B0007P0XBO,"I know there are a lot of negative reviews out there of Ocean's Twelve. While I think it's the weakest movie of the trilogy, I don't think it's terrible. There are things about it that I don't like, but there are also things about it that I like, and these positive things make the movie watchable and enjoyable, at least for me.

First, the negative aspects of the film. There are three major problems that I see. First, the plot is unnecessarily complex. One of the many positive traits about Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Thirteen is that they're both straightforward heist movies, with plots that are easy to follow. The plot of Ocean's Twelve is too smart for its own good. The ""twist"" in the movie is kind of silly and not very believable. Second, in Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Thirteen, every member of the gang is given a significant role and screen time, both of which highlight their individual personalities and acting talents. In Ocean's Twelve, the characters of Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) and Frank Catton (Bernie Mac) are given minor roles and are missing from large portions of the film. The movie does suffer from the absence of Reiner and Bernie Mac. Third, the acting by most of the members of the gang is not up to the high standards set in both the first and third films. It seemed like a lot of the guys just stood around a lot and phoned in their performances. Only the acting of Catherine Zeta-Jones had any kind of weight to it.

Now for the positive aspects of the movie. David Holmes composed the music for all three movies, and his soundtrack for this movie is just as good as the other two films. The European locations were beautifully shot. I loved the sequence near the end of the movie of the Night Fox twisting and contorting his way through the lasers in the museum. The movie does have its funny moments, especially the long sequence after the opening when Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) confronts each member of the gang. And, I got the sense that the members of Ocean's gang respected one another, as evidenced by the ending sequence, and enjoyed working together.

So, all in all, I wouldn't call this a great movie, but I wouldn't call it terrible, either. I'd call it just good enough.",1206489600,3,2219,4.584382871536524
2225449,4,B0007P0XBO,"Am I the only one who, when compelled to reach for an Ocean's flick, goes for 12 more than the others?

I think it's because 12 is the least straight forward.  Perhaps the base audience for Ocean's like their caper flicks straight forward.  I don't know.  For me, it sets itself up for repeat viewings, to try to figure it out knowing how it turns out.  I would say the first 3/4s holds my attention better than any other part of the series (except that verbal restaurant duel between Tess and Danny in 11).  I love the Isabelle character and that dynamic.  On the downside, the big Julia Roberts payoff left me ho hum.  It was a little too kitchy for my blood.  I also can't fathom why Bernie Mac, with all his talent and charisma, would be so callously shuffled aside.

No, I'm not making this up, the character played by Julia Roberts is recognized in the movie as a Julia Roberts look alike. I assume this is supposed to somehow be clever, but it hits you in the wall like a sledgehammer of stupid. Completely destroys the willing suspension of disbelief, and makes you realize that the real theives in this caper are the writer and director, and the real victim is YOUR wallet.

It hearkens back to those classic old movies where the scenery and the actors are attractive, and the dialogue is quick and witty. Catherine Zeta-Jones character and acting really makes the movie, and I have not usually been a fan of hers. The way the actors play off each other, and the natural dialogue make it fun to watch- you really care about what happens to these people. They are fun.

2225489,4,B0007P0XBO,"Ocean's Eleven set a very high standard, one of its strengths was that all the characters got their moments to shine. In Twelve, unfortunately, most of the cast is absent for most of the film. Saying that, this film was great because these characters looked human and vulnerable. I mean they full off this spectacular heist in the first movie and in this movie they are trying to stay alive by making another amazing score, but, there is the ever present danger of Andy Garcia's character threatening to kill each of them.

This film had very large shoes to fill. It's the same with every sequel that follows an amazing first movie. Some folks have been very harsh with their comments of this movie. I say the same thing every time I view a movie. You have to keep an open mind and try not to compare the sequels with the first movie. On its own  this movie has lots of charm, its filmed in Europe in three of the most exciting cities on the continent. Its kinda sad because they seem to bungle everything (have you seen anything so sad as those guys being arrested and hauled off to jail?) before it comes together.  Yes it has a lot of star power, but no not everyone is enamored with the faces of ""A"" list celebrities. Sometimes we are enamored with their acting ability. Oh, yes.

2225491,2,B0007P0XBO,"""Ocean's Eleven"" was a caper of the grandest kind: compelling mission with high stakes, satisfying execution and enough twists to keep you engaged and rooting for them to win.  It even had a love story to boot.  It was everything you wanted in a big Hollywood movie, with class and style in spades.  It also had a cliff-hanging ending that seemed to have a lot of promise.  So needless to say, I had high hopes (with caution) for the sequel.

I was disappointed. (WARNING:Major spoilers ahead)

THE GOOD:
First, the movie wasn't a complete wash.  The wit remained.  There was loads of entertaining one-liners and cheeky banter.  Brad Pitt's acting was wonderful, and I think his character seemed to be the only one that remembered what they were the first time around: cool crooks.  Even Clooney lost some of his edge, with the whole ""Do I look 50"" banter.  But I digress.  OK, the good.  Lots of beautiful people.  Nice locations.  Matt Damon delivered his role well.  I dunno.  Nice cinematography.

THE BAD:
Terrible pacing.  Twenty minutes in I still had no clue what I was watching.  To add insult to injury, Benedict was about as menacing as a grandmother yelling ""Get me my switch.""  This is the super-duper bad guy? Someone who thinks poking someone with a cane is supposed to make him ditch his HONEYMOON?!  And it got worse from there.  So many false starts for no apparent reason.  Sitting in the cafe with that guy who was totally incomprehensible did not add one shred of anything to the plot, characterization or enjoyment of the film.  And I could rattle off about 5 other pointless or too long scenes that were more suited to skits on a (bad) episode of SNL that in a movie with a forward moving plot. I've read complaints that this movie was just a vanity project to get ""the boys"" back together, and scenes like this seem to confirm that. Also, how predictable was it that the master thief was CZJ's father.  YAAAAWWWNNN! I saw that like an hour before they showed it, and, worse the reveal was cheesy and maudlin.

THE UGLY:
Everyone got arrested?!?!?!?! Huh?  What happened to our intelligent, always-one-step-ahead-of-the cops, master crooks?  Even if the arrests were staged, where's the fun in seeing everyone in jail?  Also, in the first film, the twins bickered and were dim, but were ultimately buddies. I LOVED them.  But in 12, their characterization totally changed,  and their petty, infantile bickering turned into snarky hatred - considerably less charming.  And the Julia Roberts thing was indefensible.  It totally broke the suspension of belief and again, contributed nothing.  The actors seemed to enjoy it, though.  I'm happy for them.  But, honestly I could have forgiven (almost) everything if the payoff of the heist would have been worth it.  That is why it is with infinite sadness that I must report (I cannot emphasize this point enough) the heist SUCKED!  To watch an entire movie with a disastrous, convoluted and banal heist plan (although that hologram thing was cool) only to find out that they had actually robbed some guy on a train (in a pickpocket job that Matt Damon's character probably could have pulled by himself) days earlier made me want to sue for two hours of my life back.

I really hope the Ocean's 13 redeems this tragic film.",1176854400,6,3291,4.755752212389381
2225492,2,B0007P0XBO,"I'll admit that when I saw this film for the first time, I was a bit underwhelmed.  But I simply don't understand all the bitterness, anger and vitriol being directed at it in these reviews.  I have gone back and watched the film again and I have to say that it actually grows on you. I simply don't believe that it is the stinking pile of poo that most of the reviewers claim it is.  ""Ocean's 12"" is patently inferior to ""Ocean's 11"", that is true.  But what I think is really going on here is: people came with high expectations that could never be fulfilled; the tone of the film is darker and more desperate than the first; the subplots and the twists are confusing compared with the rather linear mission of the first film and the offscreen publicity surrounding the shoot lends people to believe that the stars were having too much fun at everyone else's expense.  The anger is that of people who have been left out of an in-joke or a party they don't get to attend.

The Julia as Julia subplot was rather gutsy - but it takes you out of the picture.  I give them points for trying something ballsy that ultimately didn't serve the interests of the film (even though it gave Matt Damon some of his funniest moments).  It seems like a ""Hail Mary"" pass conjured up at the last minue to salvage a script with problems.  Furthermore, it focuses you on Julia Roberts, the celebrity, and the effect of her real-life pregnancy on her appearance (and let's be frank - she's looked a lot better in other films).

The Night Fox subplot complicated things a lot - even though Vincent Cassel did a good job with his role.  But, it felt overly contrived and reeked of the ""Pink Panther"" movies of the 60s. Certain characters were left out almost entirely - especially Bernie Mac.  The end still doesn't add up.  Was the plan improvised at the last minute or was the entire thing as intricately thought out as the Belagio heist?  To work as well as it did, it would have to have been, but you're left thinking that it was screwed up.  And if that's the case, what was the original plan? Even after a couple viewings it is still confusing.  The plot of the entire last two thirds of the film is as contorted and convoluted as the gyrations of the Night Fox trying to elude the laser beams in the museum.

On the plus side, I still found it enjoyable for what it was.  I don't come to a film like this and expect to see great art.  It was entertaining, the performances were good for the most part and even if it didn't attain the level of the first film it doesn't deserve that rancor that has been directed at it.  I still have hopes for ""Ocean's 13"" and from what I've read, the cast and director are looking to redeem themselves after this one. I just happen to disagree on the level of atonement that is required.",1175472000,3,2808,4.3531669865642995

I had no idea what half the cast was up to. Why did they put the little guy in the duffle bag? What do they plan on doing with that egg? They could never sell it. The Night Fox wiggling through the lasers was a laugh. I rarely watch a movie for the stars, and they sure weren't a plus in this movie. There were a few nice location shots and not much else. I really enjoyed Ocean's Eleven , but this movie was just a mish-mash of through together scenes.",1167523200,7,627,4.105691056910569
2225495,3,B0007P0XBO,"OCEAN'S ELEVEN was a great heist movie.  It was far more entertaining than the original Brat Pack film and included a more upbeat ending.  The movie worked on a lot of different levels and though the cast including a huge list of stars, each character had just enough screen time to make the audience care for everyone involved on Danny Ocean's team.  The plot of the film was tight and the payoff for the audience was in learning how the heist was pulled off.  OCEAN'S ELEVEN was only expected to be a moderate success, but ended up doing quite well.  So well, in fact, that they quickly put together plans for a sequel.

Thus came OCEAN'S TWELVE.  Beginning three years after OCEAN'S ELEVEN ended, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the casino owner the gang ripped off in the OCEAN'S ELEVEN has uncovered the identities of everyone that was involved and wants his money back plus interest,  close to $190 million.  They've got two weeks to pay up or they're all good as dead men walking.  Apparently there isn't a gig with a big enough pay off in the U.S. (or perhaps the filmmakers just wanted to spend some time in Europe) so the crew travels overseas:  Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris.  Meanwhile, the group is being hunted by an Europol agent, Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is connected to Rusty's (Brad Pitt) past and they are also being out conned everywhere they go by a Frenchman known only as the ""Night Fox.""

All of the members of OCEAN'S ELEVEN are back in this movie (that was one of the film's tag lines--something like ""They're back, all of them"") but unfortunately most of them have much smaller roles to play.  Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, et al are basically regulated to roles as props and set pieces.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is added as part of the cast (thus the ""twelve"" of the title) and is a nice addition, but she's the only new element added that adds any flavor to this facsimile of the first movie.  Also, instead of trying to think of something original, the general plot of the movie falls into the land of the absurd so much than when the final revelations are revealed the whole film comes off as being a disappointment and a cop-out.

I was disappointed by OCEAN'S TWELVE.  It could have been a great follow-up to an excellent heist picture.  Instead Soderburgh, Clooney, and crew must have decided that they would rather have fun than focus on making a movie.  Thus, what is left is a film full of stars and fluff, but one that has no substance or style.  It has some small moments, but those are drowned out by the lack of intention and purpose.  Stay tuned for OCEAN'S THIRTEEN to see if Soderburgh and Clooney end up redeeming themselves for the failure to pull-off the coup in OCEAN'S TWELVE.",1158624000,6,2742,4.598765432098766
2225496,1,B0007P0XBO,The first movie worked because it highlighted how the thieves planned and executed the amazing heist. This one fails because 95% of the movie has nothing to do with showing us a theft. It's like they figured 'we showed a theft last time - so let's focus on the story this time'. That's all well and good except for this movie - the heist IS the story. So in other words they forgot to show us the very movie we went to see. So instead of seeing how these guys work - we get to see lots of junk. Not for a second does the audience believe the Oceans crew is in danger because the story has no substance to it. On the plus side Catherine Zeta Jones is ridiculously hot - so that's great to see. On the down side - Julia Roberts looks terrible (as per usual) but this time she plays the character Tess who plays the actress Julia Roberts!!!??? This whole scene with Bruce Willis is awful and ridiculous. I cant believe they filmed it - let alone wrote it. I half expected the scene to turn into a blooper reel and the director apologizing for trying out this bad idea. Anyway - overall this movie was boring and garbage. I expected to see a heist film that showcased how professional thieves work their trade. Instead I saw a movie that had nothing going for it other than beautiful talent.

Sesame Street is having an aneurysm over this movie's slogan: ""Twelve is the new Eleven"". Having nailed the formula down pat with ""Ocean's Eleven"" - ridiculously implausible action and pulp coincidences, snide and smarmy rock soundtrack (evoking a Guy Ritchie-ish lan), smash-cuts and wobbling Steadicams, overlapping, smart-ass dialog, and A-List megastars glutting all 70 millimeters of the widescreen - director Steven Soderbergh now hurls ""Ocean's Twelve"" at us like an elitist Upper Class Molotov cocktail and hopes we don't run screaming into the sallow beigeness of our mundane, everyday lives. Filled as it is with man-toys (from Clooney's too-hip instigator, Danny Ocean, to Damon's stuttering novice, Linus, to Pitt's glib Tyler Durden franchise, here named Rusty Ryan) and toy women (the stunningly rapturous Catherine Zeta-Jones as Rusty's ex-sex, Detective Isabel, and the stunningly bland Julia Roberts playing Tess, Ocean's spouse), we find the camera righteously slewing all over creation trying to cram them all in, making for a movie so self-aware of its megastar cheese-wattage that it can't quite get over its own smugness.

2004's ""Ocean's Twelve"" picks up where 2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"" left off. When we last saw them, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his hand-picked gang of professional thieves had successfully heisted multi-million dollar fortunes from three Las Vegas casinos, then headed their separate ways to start life anew as upstanding members of their respective communities; however, they've since learned that the past has a way of catching up with a person no matter how much he may try to hide from it, when Tony Benedict (Andy Garcia), the Bellagio owner, still stewing over the money that was stolen from him three years earlier, shows up on Ocean's doorstep demanding restitution. He gives Ocean and his gang two weeks to come up with the $97 million they owe him or face the consequences. Thus, Danny gathers up the gang once again and heads off to Europe, hoping to lift a few priceless art pieces to stave off certain death (though it's never made entirely clear just how Benedict is proposing to carry out this rather grandiose threat). What Danny doesn't count on is that he will be going up against two worthy adversaries, one a detective (Zeta-Jones) and the other a rival thief (Vincent Cassel), who will give him more trouble than he ever bargained for.

With the remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"", things seemed to move so quickly with such flair and style that substance didn't matter that much and it managed to pull off the trick and come across as fluffy fun. The sequel clearly tries to pull off the same trick but it cannot manage it and, although it has some fun moments, it ends up being pretty messy, lacking slick pace and failing to really please the audience in the way that its predecessor did.  ""Ocean's Twelve"" is a disappointment for a whole host of reasons, most of them rooted in the format and structure of the film. For this second outing, writer George Nolfi and returning director Steven Soderbergh (""Out of Sight"") have come up with a ha'penny storyline that lacks the intricacy and elegance of the tale in ""Ocean's Eleven."" Not only does this caper seem haphazardly planned from beginning to end, but the resolution of it falls miserably flat, providing neither the amazement nor the amusement we expect to find in these kinds of stories. Perhaps the idea of stealing a priceless Faberge Egg just doesn't rank up there in either chutzpah or style with knocking over a whole Las Vegas casino, and so the enterprise is more or less doomed to failure from the start. Or perhaps the filmmakers simply failed to find enough for all these characters to do while they're roaming the streets of Amsterdam, Paris and Rome on what appears to be little more than an extended European vacation for some talented but woefully underused actors.  In this type of film, plotting is everything, and the sad truth is that the plotting in ""Ocean's Twelve"" is pretty damn awful any way you slice it, whether its eleven or twelve pieces.",1138406400,2,4378,5.049861495844875

For one, this movie felt more like Ocean's 5 instead of 12 as one reviewer put it. The character development from the first movie is missing in this one as this movie focuses more on star power versus a well in-depth story. Don't get me wrong, the actors did good considering the script they had to work with but even after viewing this a second time, I felt that more should have been done with the story. Speaking of the story, it is somewhat hard to understand what is going on at times. Now I usually compliment movies that keep the audience guessing as to what is going on but Ocean's 12 seemed to do so for the sake of trying to cover plot holes. I won't give out spoilers but if you liked Ocean's 11 than you should watch this just to see what I'm talking about. Overall, Ocean's 12 is not a bad movie but more should have been done with it in accordance to the first. As for the DVD, there are no bonus features to speak of which I might add is typical for a second rate sequel. Rumor has it there will be a director's cut release of Ocean's 12.

2225569,3,B0007P0XBO,"Ocean's Twelve, was a bit of a disappointment considering how wonderful Ocean's Eleven had been.  The film picks up about three years after the successful heist in Las Vegas with Terry Benedict having tracked down the members of the team, and demanding his money back.  Subsequently, Ocean's Twelve fly to Europe in search of ""jobs"" to do and get themselves involved in more than they bargained for...

George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, do a very good job considering that the plot is not that great.

There are quite a few unnecessary flaws with the movie, such as Matt Damon's unexpected and unexplained political correctness as well as the plot jumping around all over the place, to mention a few.

In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it.  3 Stars",1132704000,,927,4.7625
2225570,3,B0007P0XBO,"It's an okay film with little to no great reason to watch unless you are fans of the last movie. Lots of bad things going on that suck - storywise, but tons of cool things that don't - cool-wise. Literally, every scene that the whhole gang is in together is a great scene. They have so much good chemistry, it's unreal. But you have to acknowledge the plot points and fiascoes. Like, if these guys could prosper in Amsterdam, why didn't they just stay there and live off their money? Instead, they get scared because the guy from the last film wants his money back, has found them in America, and has people in place to kill every one of them. So they scramble to get the money they once stole and spent so that they can get it back to him in one piece. I could trash this thing with all kinds of plot holes, but I'd rather not because I like it.

I need you guys to know that there is a very excellent sountrack to this movie. If not entirely, it is at least to the music played during the French thief's dance. Without a doubt, this is the coolest part of the movie. One of the coolest things I've ever seen in a film. And the actor did his own dance stunts.

Ocean's Eleven have made a terrible mistake. They never expected retaliation. That is a lousy idea for a movie, in my opinion.

The stealth aspect is really lousy and that's why we always wanted to see this film. To make sure that it was better than the last. Their latest idea of who the twelve will be is a mix of ideas between Catherine Zeta Jones and Julia Roberts. Bad film with a great cast put together by a lousy script and a worse director. Often, the handheld camera shakes and takes the weirdest angles. This thing could have been incredible if they'd kept the Brad Pitt stuff, realized who they wanted as the lead ( Pitt or Clooney) and made sure that the important stuff was in the forefront.

When I say ""average wonder"" we are talking about people who could be there or not. There are perfectly good reasons to not keep them and even less reasons to keep them. This movie had one reason, and everyone involved was thinking too broadly, but not too intelligently.

But, it is very funny in that it makes fun of the things it deems cool. When one informant-type tells Catherine Zeta Jones that Brad Pitt dresses like a gigolo, you immediately know why he said it and you question your own appreciation of his clothes when minutes ago you know you loved his style. Really, Brad Pitt is so ridiculously cool in this thing that you want to be him for a few minutes.

Matt Damon's is easily the best role in the film. He seems to have reinvented his character for the better. He really is great. And no matter how cool the French guy is, what he does later is impossible according to what the Ocean's thief says about the layout. Plot hole.

The thing about this film is that no one cares about being plausible. They wanted to make a movie with lots of cool guys doing cool things and they succeeded. That's the only reason I don't give it two stars. They did what they wanted to do. All the way down to a great idea thrown in about Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Very cool.

2225573,3,B0007P0XBO,"The main problem with Ocean's 12 is that Ocean's 11 was so good. Ocean's 11 had the classic romance of Danny Ocean and Tess; it had the classic villain, Terry Benedict; it had Las Vegas looming so large that the city and its casinos were themselves a ""character"" in the film. The entire film worked so well, and many of its elements couldn't be duplicated in this one. After Danny and Tess get back together, that tension was lost. After Saul, Carl reiner's character, pulls one last big job, an element was lost. Terry Benedict, superbly played by Andy Garcia is no longer such a huge element. And there's no place else like Las Vegas.

All this colors your perceptions of Ocean's 12, and it suffers by comparison. But on its own merits, it's a pretty good film. Lots of star power, an interesting and engaging plot with plenty of twists, witty dialogue, interesting locations. Compared to most other crime capers, this one stands up pretty well.

Were I running the project, I would have done a prequel, not a sequel. That would have allowed the film to pick up and use many of the larger elements of Ocean's 11, such as the Danny-Tess romance and split, Saul's earlier career, etc. And who knows, maybe we'll see one eventually.",1130889600,,1231,4.616438356164384

Granted, the back story between Zeta-Jones and Pitt add a new dimension, and the comic use of Julia Roberts' character Tess pretending to be the film star 'Julia Roberts' provides some great, and much needed relief, from the complicated plot and strange script.

There are perhaps too many twists and turns - Ocean get away with too much and somehow manage to know all the secret contacts they need, despite being on foreign soil. While you can suspend reality for fiction, this film does perhaps ask for too much of that.

For those watching outside the US, beware the anti-French 'vibe', which gets a little tiresome and is somewhat sickening. Does the writer have some issues with the Iraq? An angry Republican? Who knows.

2225600,3,B0007P0XBO,"Ocean's Twelve is not as good as Ocean's Eleven.  This was a great disappointment to me, because I loved Ocean's Eleven.  Ocean's Twelve doesn't have the elegant and simple wrap-up to the plot that Eleven did - I had to watch this three times to fully understand what happened, and even now I'm not sure that I totally have it.  Twelve does not spend as much time on the characters and doesn't have the same amount of action as Eleven.  In other words, it just isn't as cool.

This is not to say that Twelve doesn't have its moments.  I thought that the opening sequence of Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) tracking down our intrepid heros was well done, particularly as it shows a bit about how each person spent their money and reacts to the news that Benedict wants it all back.  The problem is that this is the end of the character story with the exception of Catherine Zeta Jones and Brad Pitt, which is a sort-of love story.

There are certainly some funny moments in the film, such as when Yen gets stuck in a bag and when Ruben asks his palm-reader why she couldn't see Benedict coming.  The end with Julia Roberts is hysterical.  Overall, the acting is excellent and the score, again, is fantastic.  The film is shot in a 70s sort of style, and the music reflects this; sadly, I think that the music is more effective than the camera angles and lighting.

Regarding the DVD, there were very few special features.  This is basically the film in a couple of languages and the trailer; I suspect that something with commentary will eventually come out, but I'm not sure.

If this had been the first film in the series instead of the second, I probably would not have gone to see a sequel.

Except for the neo-rat-pack having fun, and maybe encouraging the viewer to believe he/she is a member and in on all the sly inside wit, it is a bit hard to see the attraction of this film.

Yes, some reviewers gave Twelve three stars--am it is unclear why.  It is long, disorganized, pandering, narcissistic, and without much coherence to the plot.

Basically, the gang from the last film has been caught by the obnoxious casino owner.  He will kill them all if they don't repay what they stole from the casino vault--with interest.  For no clear reason, they head off to Europe to pull an even bigger heist.  Along the way, they fall into rivalry with a master thief reminiscent of 'the Fox' in the Peter Sellers classic ""After the Fox.""

2225605,1,B0007P0XBO,"Ocean's 11 was a fun caper movie, as long as you didn't think too hard about it and enjoyed the ride.  That the cast was populated with some of Hollywood's finest - Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, and the best actor in Hollywood at the moment, Brad Pitt - made the film worthwhile.  The amount of money that it made pretty much guaranteed a sequel.  I thought to myself, ""It probably won't be as good, but if the same cast comes back, it'll have to be fun!""

I was dead wrong.  The entire cast looks like they just mailed in their performances (with the exception of Damon, who has some truly inspired lines and situations - berating his partners for using disparaging language, being rescued by his mother, telling Ocean he's ready for ""a more central role,"" etc.).  Not only that, but the lackadaisical effort extends to the editors, the director, the scriptwriters, etc.  As far as sequels go, this one was pointless to start with because everything that could be done was done in the first film.  But the action within this movie itself is also pointless!  For example, instead of lowering himself 2 feet over a wall to make a shot with a harpoon, the conspirators instead choose to raise an entire house (one with 3 high-tech security systems) 2 feet so the shot can be made from an adjoining roof.  Surely one of those secturity systems would notice the entire house being raised, and if not, the people living in it surely would!

In a good movie, I wouldn't question such absurdity (and Roger Ebert seems to think the absurdity is the point).  But this is not a good movie, and everything in it is so needlessly complex you can't stand it because the payoff isn't worth the effort.  I was reminded of the Gene Siskel test: a good film is one that is more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch.  This movie isn't even more interesting than a documentary of the empty restaurant where the actors will have their lunch later that day.

To add insult to injury, the DVD is bad.  The sound (at least on my system) is terrible - the music track is at a level about twice as loud as the dialogue track.  Were the producers trying to hide the inanity of the film?  In addition, it is literally the most featureless DVD I have ever seen.  The ""extras"" consist of 1 theatrical trailer.

2225631,2,B0007P0XBO,"2004`s ""Ocean's Twelve"" picks up where 2001`s ""Ocean's Eleven"" left off.  When we last saw them, Danny Ocean and his hand-picked gang of professional thieves had successfully heisted multi-million dollar fortunes from three Las Vegas casinos, then headed their separate ways to start life anew as upstanding members of their respective communities.  However, they've since learned that the past has a way of catching up with a person no matter how much he may try to hide from it, when Tony Benedict, the Bellagio owner, still stewing over the money that was stolen from him three years earlier, shows up on Ocean`s doorstep demanding restitution.  He gives Ocean and his gang two weeks to come up with the $97 million they owe him or face the consequences.  Thus, Danny gathers up the gang once again and heads off to Europe, hoping to lift a few priceless art pieces to stave off certain death (though it`s never made entirely clear just how Benedict is proposing to carry out this rather grandiose threat).  What Danny doesn't count on is that he will be going up against two worthy adversaries - one a detective and the other a rival thief - who will give him more trouble than he ever bargained for.

""Ocean's Twelve"" is a disappointment for a whole host of reasons, most of them rooted in the format and structure of the film.  For this second outing, writer George Nolfi and returning director Steven Soderbergh have come up with a ha`penny storyline that lacks the intricacy and elegance of the tale in ""Ocean's Eleven.""  Not only does this caper seem haphazardly planned from beginning to end, but the resolution of it falls miserably flat, providing neither the amazement nor the amusement we expect to find in these kinds of stories.  Perhaps the idea of stealing a priceless Faberge Egg just doesn't rank up there in either chutzpah or style with knocking over a whole Las Vegas casino, and so the enterprise is more or less doomed to failure from the start.  Or perhaps the filmmakers simply failed to find enough for all these characters to do while they're roaming the streets of Amsterdam, Paris and Rome on what appears to be little more than an extended European vacation for some talented but woefully underused actors.  Moreover, there is a side foray involving Julia Roberts trying to pass herself off as Julia Roberts that is inane, incredible, preposterous and embarrassing.  The sequence is indicative of the lazy, half-hearted approach the filmmakers have taken towards both their material and their audience.

It's also unpleasant watching the one character with even a smidgen of a moral code crossing over to the dark side at the end of the story - and asking us to get all misty-eyed and choked-up when it happens (at least when Anakin does it, we aren't expected to cheer him on from the sidelines).

The high-priced, big-name actors - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon and Albert Finney - go through the motions, but they seem hopelessly cut adrift by the meandering, substandard screenplay.  Actually, only Catherine Zeta-Jones, as the detective and former girlfriend of Brad Pitt, is given anything of genuine substance to work with here.  All the rest are just picking up paychecks.

In this type of film, plotting is everything, and the sad truth is that the plotting in ""Ocean's Twelve"" is pretty damn awful any way you slice it.  We`ve already had it sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?",1121385600,3,3510,4.850921273031826
2225632,3,B0007P0XBO,"This is one for the books.  I often comment that all Julia Roberts can do is play variations of herself in movies- or to put it another way, no matter what she does in a movie, it's Julia Roberts all over again.  The joke this time is on me.  Amidst the plethora (gotta use the word once in a while)of stars, some of whom simply walk through their parts, is Julia- who is doing herself. I mean it. She plays herself. That's not a bad device-especially since it's what she does best.
That aside (or even likewise), there's not too much to this flick.  It either confuses or leaves much of the mystery out (which is why it all has to be explained in the last scene), and there's hardly any attention devoted to how they pull off their capers. A lot of technical stuff is minimized- which is fine with me- but in its place the film merely chugs along as the gang meanders from one mistake to another, more like the Pink Panther than a Topkopi.  The cast does appear to enjoy themselves, which is probably true, but there's not much acting going on. It's the Oceans 11 gang just  reprising for a laugh. In some instances, it gets downright embarassing as when, in an obvious satirical effort, Matt Damon over-does his naive role. Most often, these stars simply throw digs at each other and use their moronic lines to poke fun- all giggles but no substance.  The European locations for many of the scenes are invitingly filmed: Amsterdam and Rome look splendid and provide wonderful backdrops- especially if you've seen enough of Vegas, and who hasn't?! Otherwise, the script is not too deep, the scheme is far too superficial and most humor has to rely on slapstick.  All in all- it's a romp, but one that's not very daring.  If there's a plus it's Catherine Zeta Jones getting more screen time than Julia- always  a positive- but don't take this film too seriously and don't expect much. It's light entertainment and a feast for the stargazer -more for the voyeur than the viewer- and that's about it.",1121212800,,1998,4.525

There's a whole lot of starpower in this movie.  Massive powders kegs of it.  Stars left and right.  As if the first movie didn't have enough, this one throws Albert Finney, John Travolta, and Catherine Zeta-Jones into the mix just to entice you even more.

And I love most of the actors/actresses in this movie.  And with the exception of Julia Roberts, the cast does a pretty good job.  Those who reprise their roles from the first film show that they haven't gotten ""out of shape"" and those who are newcomers fit their roles nicely.

But the script and the story both leave a lot to be desired.  The dialogue thinks it's a lot cooler than it really is---there's not much wit or snap or sass in this movie.  It's a straightforward, lame action-movie script that feels very boring to hear.  The director tries to compensate for this with stylistic cuts and camera angles, or by having the actors speak with flair.  Flair they've got, but the material they're delivering still sounds dead and passionless no matter how great their acting is.

The story is no better.  There's no focus---you have this sublot with Linus trying to get promoted to Shift Leader and then there's a subplot about Danny and Tess and then there's this whole romantic plot between Rusty and Lahiri.  All of that would be fine if the movie could take one storyline at a time and develop it more strongly.  Instead, the movie rapidly cuts between them so that you never get a chance to get hooked into it.  None of the subplots seem all that interesting and so you end up with a case of quantity over quality (a flaw of many big-budget pictures).

And when you realize what the main plot-line is, it's actually pretty dull and has none of the sparkle or charm of the first movie.  In the first movie, there was a gang of likeable underdog thieves who are going to steal a bunch of money from an unlikeable casino owner.  In this movie, there's a bunch of idiots who have to steal the Faberge egg because they're in a thievery competition with a petty Super Thief.  That's just dumb.  Surely, somebody could've found a more interesting and more believable reason for the Ocean's Eleven gang to come together again and pull another heist.  This is the sort of plot you find in crappy family movies.  ""Oh, no, the rich kids at Camp Hawkfish want to buy out our camp and turn it into a golf course.  The only way we can stop them is to enter an archery competition and win!""

The movie isn't all bad.  It has style and the acting is mostly good and you get to see a whole bunch of celebs hanging out.  But rather than waste money on that, you could always just go to the supermarket and read the tabloid headlines to get a more intellectually stimulating experience.",1121212800,10,3161,4.458188153310105
2225634,3,B0007P0XBO,"I think they tried for something a little different in the sequel. Seemed confusing at first but a second viewing proved to be beneficial. Interaction between characters (all) was very well written, although the plot seemed to suffer throughout. It is definitely not an 11 but it has its moments and is a totally different movie. I think if you enjoyed the characters in the first, you will enjoy this one, although most of the characters do not all have a central role as before. But the movie still proved to be a lot of fun to watch.",1121126400,,536,4.479591836734694
2225635,3,B0007P0XBO,"I loved Ocean's 11. While the cast is still as talented as they were, the magic seems to be gone. There's no focus to the movie. instead of one big heist, there are several mini-heists. It's too difficult to keep up with.

 There are a few really good jokes and one-liners. There's a great Hollywood in-joke scene that make it worth watching. But I would rent or get it from your local library.",1121040000,,394,4.383561643835616
2225655,2,B0007P0XBO,"OCEAN'S ELEVEN has several things going for it.  An attractive cast of well-known actors allowed to be as charming and rascally as possible, creating a sense of fun that carried right out to the audience.  We felt we were picking up on a little of the vibe that the actors themselves had when making the film...""we're slumming and we love it.""  It also had an actual heist to be involved in, which when finally executed, was taut, amusing and generated real suspense and surprise.

OCEAN'S TWELVE loses almost all of that.  The actor's seem more pleased with themselves than actually having fun.  No doubt folks like George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones pulled own nice paychecks, spent most of their time in luxury hotels in beautiful European cities and probably never really looked at their scripts until they showed up on set.  It feels that way to the viewer at least.

The premise is that they are forced to return the money they stole in the first movie (with interest), and naturally they have spent it all already.  So they have to concoct a bigger heist.  There's also some side-stuff dealing with another thief who may or may not be helping/thwarting them in their efforts.  To be quite honest, when the movie was done, I had to really wonder just what exactly had happened.  The implication was that they hadn't really pulled off a heist at all.  Who knows?  And more importanly...who cares!

The movie kind of rambles.  And it makes huge mistakes in the use of its cast.  In the first, the ""stars"" (Clooney, Pitt, Julia Roberts) received quite a bit of support from their lesser stars (Matt Damon...really funny, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould (big laughs), Carl Reiner, etc.).  In OCEAN'S TWELVE, these guys are relegated to background roles, imprisoned early on, etc.  They are sorely missed.  It was the mixed-up chemistry of the group that added so much spark to the first.  Now we have to look mostly at Clooney & Pitt.  Unless you're huge fans of them at their most smug and self-satisfied, they ain't easy to watch.

The only clever part was when the character played by Julia Roberts is forced to impersonate Julia Roberts.  That's pretty funny, and Roberts gamely pokes fun at herself.  However, Roberts (pregnant during the shoot, I think) looks wan and frankly skews from uninterested to unhealthy looking.  She brings very little joy to the proceedings.

Everyone involved should feel a little ashamed of themselves, because they're usually quality folks, from the stars to the director.  So it really feels almost palpable that they did it mostly for the money.  I don't recommend this film to anyone except the most ardent Pitt or Clooney fans.",1120867200,,2679,4.826373626373626
2225656,3,B0007P0XBO,"Some movies should never have sequels; such as, Mortal Kombat, The Fast and the Furious, Lion King, xXx, just to name a few.  ""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of these films that should not have a sequel made, at least not one as bad as ""Ocean's Twelve"".  ""Ocean's Eleven"" did what so many other remakes have tried and failed to do, which is top the original, however just because a film is good and does well at the box office does not mean a sequel should be thrown together to cash in.  This is exactly how ""Ocean's Twelve"" feels to me, it comes off as if director Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney were talking and said, ""Hey wouldn't it be cool to get the entire gang back from the original and do another one?"".  But instead of taking the time to either write a proper story to follow up the original or at least have one written that does the original justice, we get this heaping pile of crap that is ""Ocean's Twelve"".

""Ocean's Twelve"" picks up quite some time after ""Ocean's Eleven"".  Danny Ocean and his wife, Tess (George Clooney and Julia Roberts respectively), and the rest of the eleven are enjoying their retirement from criminal life and reaping the rewards from their last heist (seen in the original film).  However, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) has not forgotten what Danny Ocean and his crew stole from him and someone has supplied him with all the information he needs to find Ocean's Eleven and make them pay with interest.  This leads Danny to reunite his crew to attempt several jobs to try to repay the debt before they all wind up dead, but now there is competition from rival thieves, not to mention one of Danny's crew is dating a law enforcement agent.

""Ocean's Twelve"" I'm sure sounded good to the executives and I know they saw dollar signs at the prospect of getting the entire original cast back plus the addition of Catherine Zeta-Jones, but the un-original plotline, and boring script caused this movie and this possible franchise to come to a halt in my opinion.  Studios need to learn that just because you have a stellar cast, and a talented director does not always equal an excellent movie.  ""Ocean's Twelve"", like so many sequels to come before it, simply could not touch the greatness of the first film, leaving audiences feeling that the previews had lied to them and that ""Twelve Is Not the New Eleven"".

""Ocean's Twelve"" is rated PG-13 for language.",1120608000,,2390,4.610849056603773

The plot was so thick with ""twists"" and devices that the film quickly became hard to watch and quite boring. The film drags in more than a few places and many of the scenes seem out of place. That being said, this was an all star cast and there were a few memorable moments that salvages this movie from 2 stars. But by the time the big climatic reveal of how they did it rolls around, I was having trouble not falling asleep.",1120521600,,602,4.383928571428571
2225658,5,B0007P0XBO,"Ocean's 12 is truly a great sequal.  Those who did not like this film are only casual fans of Ocean's 11 and of cinema in general.  I can understand they may have trouble with this film because their lack of film knowledge and their attention to the original may be lacking.  This was so intelligent and funny, and the continuity of Ocean's 11 is carried through so well (things refered to in the first film are brought to fruition in this sequal...Linus's parents, Rule #1, etc...)  There are so many inside jokes and references for film lovers as well (esp. the Miller's Crossing discussion and a certian actor revealed at the end, and the Bruce Willis/Hudson Hawk connection, plus others).  Sure sometimes one has to suspend disbelief, but hell, this is a fictional movie, not a biopic!  Also the style and music of the film is that of a great european 60's - 70's heist flick (to fit in with the theme).  I also love that each character has an idiosynchrasy of thier own (most carried over from the last film, some comedic cliches).  The idea of a rival thief is also quite novel, funny, and adds a good twist.  It is sad that people see this as a poor sequal, obviously they just do not pay attention to the little details, those things that make films truly great.  If you really allow yourself to think of all the meta-references and continuities, then you may actually see how rich this film really is!

  For the young people that do not understand, Dean Martin , Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr were very popular singers in the 1950's and 1960's and their tunes are still a favorite today.  Not only did these entertainers have much in common, they were also wonderful actors.  They teamed for the original ""Ocean's 11"" motion picture in 1960.  Actually filmed in Las Vegas, Nevada at many of the popular casinos in town (sadly, many of the older landmarks are now gone).

It's a film you can watch over and over again.
  They also reteamed in Sergeants 3 (1962) and Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964). They also did concerts together.
 Sammy Davis Jr. died in 1990, Dean Martin died on Christmas 1995 and Frank Sinatra passed in 1998.
  In 2000, George Clooney decided he would make a remake of ""Ocean's 11"" for 2001.

It became a curious hit because some people liked it, but it was quite different than the original 1960 version and it did not have the suspense, mystic or twist ending of the original.
  Well, George Clooney agreed to make a sequel, ""Ocean's Tweleve.  The first time i saw this movie, after 50 minutes, I just did not care about this film.  Where is the juicy heist?  The only character that held my interest was ""Yen"" played again by Shaobo Qin.  Bruce Willis comes in to play himself just in time to try and save the picture.
  If they make a third film, ""Ocean's Thirteen"", I hope they go back to Las Vegas for the biggest heist ever.

2225660,1,B0007P0XBO,"Just like Dumb and Dumberer and The Matrix sequels this is a fine example of when the idiosyncracies of characters in the first movie are blown completely out of proportion. Don Cheadle is more argumentative, Matt Damon more timid, and Brad Pitt portrays Rusty Ryan as so easy going that he seems less like the character from the first movie and more like (believe it or not) his character in Fight Club: Tyler Durden.

Also, some of the Eleven, like Bernie Mac and Shaobo Qin, are virtually nonexistent, being on screen for maybe less than thirty seconds every twenty or thirty minutes. Perhaps a better title for the movie would be The George And Brad Show. On the other hand, it skipped around so much that it became very hard to follow and contained several subplots that could easily have been removed.

I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater, but if I still haven't dissuaded you enough to not see it at all, at least save yourself some money and rent it.",1119225600,2,962,4.522988505747127

So what's this got to do with Ocean's 12 you ask? Well, not much, except to point out that Hollywood has to stop making these movies. Don't get me wrong, I loved the original, it's sitting on my bookshelf and I watch it every now and then. But reuniting a quality cast won't work unless you have a great script and this does NOT. And i'm not one of those guys who swoons over Julia Roberts. There are a couple of laughs that earn it a star or two, but I declare: WHERE IS THE LOVE? The first one got it all right! This is banther fodder.

Where's the humor of Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac and the Mormon Twins? Locked up for half the movie!

The story theme is great: Benedict knows who ripped him off, and the insurance payment isn't enough to soothe his wounded ego; he wants it back from the thieves. Another master thief issues a challenge to the team: steal a Faberge egg before I do, and I'll pay your debt for you. The director and screenwriters lose it from there, though, by separating everyone.

Still, the movie has its moments, with Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts, and a witty cameo by Bruce Willis. The ending leaves an opening for Ocean's 13, and let's hope they get a bit better script next time around.",1118707200,2,925,4.739130434782608

I was proud of being one of (apparently few) people who understood the entire plot of Mission: Impossible the first time through.  But alas, this one escaped me completely.  Either I'm not as smart as I think I am (very probable) or else the editing was so choppy, the plot so thin and the script so contrived that there was simply not much there for me to ""get.""  Guess which possibility gets my vote?

It must be nice to be a rich Hollywood actor!  To have movie studios give you millions of dollars so that you can go party in Europe for several months AND get paid top dollar for it in additon to having most of your major expenses covered has GOT to be the life.  No wonder so many people want to go to Hollywood and become actors!  Acting has nothing to do with it anymore.

This is just a party, and for $9 (or $20 for the DVD), you're invited to it!  The actors are wasted because no acting is required of them; they just get to be themselves.  Inside jokes abound as do plot holes and it's so poorly edited I feel like they should take Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" Oscar back.

Julia Roberts is pregnant and so is her ""character"" Tess Ocean -- who just happens to look like Julia Roberts!  Gee, I wonder why!

I don't understand how it wasn't obvious to the director how this looked so cheesy that ii came across as just plain dumb...If they're going to put that much talent together and spend so much on production, then you'd think they'd make sure there was a damn good script to use all that talent.

This was a good follow-up to the first movie, although it did not even get close to matching the thrill of it. The story was MUCH weaker in this one, most of it contrived so confusingly that when you find out the outcome you are mad at how they took such an easy way out. You either like the tricks they do in this movie or you feel cheated. Or you feel a little of both, as I did.

I can't say much about the plot because there are so many spoilers, but I will say there is a big surprise with one of the characters from the first movie that is quite funny. Some people hated it (one of the ""cheap"" moments) but I thought it was great. There are many plot holes but director Soderbourgh keeps you so interested in the characters and flashy style of the movie that you might not even notice them. No other director could get away with it, that's for sure.

There is mild controversy over who, exactly, is Ocean's twelfth member. I honestly can't say 100% for sure because there are three people who could be considered as such. But there is one person who seems a little more likely to be that person because of a certain...event?

Brad Pitt's on camera eating habits in the first movie were something to smile at, in this one, it's simply annoying. Julia Roberts pretending to be Julia Roberts - what a stretch for the writers!

2225711,4,B0007P0XBO,"Quite a few people I know told me the movie wasn't good so I didn't go see it on big screen. Now that I've watched in on DVD, surprisingly I quite like it and actually think it's as good as its prequel [in a different way though].

I like the combination of light action, romance, comedy, and a bit of suspense here. The strongest point of the movie must be a medley of huge stars [Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Garcia, Zeta Jones,  Roberts]. Even supporting actors are all first-class! All of them play their parts really really well and even the supporting cast could hold their own against the big actors. It is amazing that you can feel a burst of energy and charms from these people in almost every scence. I actually felt like watching a celebrity party in a way, LOL.

Another thing I like in the movie is the sizzling romance. They didn't even have to use cheap sex scenes to tell the story. The chemistry between Clooney and Roberts is okay and the Pitt-Jones pairing is just incredible.

More good things: neat script with lots of funny quirky lines, good editing and delicious outfitting [but well we all know that Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Zeta Jones, and Roberts would look good even if they wore paperbags!]

Okay, now the weak points: The plot is kinda weak and not very believable. The movie could be confusing at times. I had to watch it twice to pick up some of the details. Also, those who go in expecting series of action would surely be disappointed. There is not a single violent scene in the movie if I remember correctly. The suspense element is not too good either. What else, there is not a whole lot of high tech gadgets for this Ocean's 12. Maybe these are why some people don't like this sequel as much as Ocean's 11.

So to sum it up, I think it's a fun movie if you watch it as a romantic comedy. The movie can't quite boast its action and suspense elements though.

Recommendation: Rent it and you'll get good two hours of entertainment. I bought the DVD just because I like many many funny scenes in the movie and wouldn't mind watching them over and over again.",1116115200,,2083,4.422976501305483

First off, this is NOT a caper movie, as there really isn't a caper that is pulled off, it is instead an excuse to get big name actors together for a party in Europe. Every actor mails it in including Brad Pitt and George Clooney, who I ususally think are great actors. The plot is ludicrous, comparable to the absurd nonsense of Basic. In the end, I didn't even understand what happened in the movie, though I doubt Steven Soderbergh did either. His attempts at quick frame camera work are annoying and insulting to the audience. The character of The Night Fox was one of the worst conceived characters in cinematic history. Who cares if he is rich and bored and someone said Ocean was a better thief??? dumb, dumb, DUMB!!!

The whole movie looks like they originally shot 4 hour movie, and then squezed it into two hours. Result is a mess of pieces that just don't add up.

It is generally fun for me to watch a creative criminal mind at work. However in this movie criminals have access to apparently unlimited resources, which makes it totally unnecessary for them to be creative. They just operate in a made up world, which is boring. Nothing in this movie makes any sense.  The movie is completely unrealistic.

In that context Watching REAL stories about REAL criminals on Discovery Channel (""Mastermid"") is by far more entertaining.",1115856000,3,715,4.650793650793651
2225753,2,B0007P0XBO,"Well, I guess I shall have to add my name to the unhappy guest book of those who expected so much from this film only to be sadly disappointed.  But I would like to add that it is more than just a matter of spoiled expectations.  Had OCEAN'S TWELVE been released in a world without its explosive prequel, it would have suffered from the same attacks that are being levied against it.  I was worried from the opening ten minutes of the film when Terry Benedict goes on his ""rounds"" tracking down each member of the original crew.  These ten minutes felt like a newborn colt trying to find its balance.  Moreover, tracking down all of the members was excessive and we could have been spared the tedium.

After a while, the film finds its pace and settles into a standard, ""enjoyable"" caper film.  One thing pointed out by others that I have to second is the lack of screen time for all of our main characters.  Part of the fun of OCEAN'S ELEVEN was the fact that the job required eleven experts to pull it off.  Of course, it is hard to recreate these conditions in a sequel, but this film seems to require only a couple of crooks while the rest are along for the ride.  We hardly get to see any of our beloved characters, with the exception of Matt Damon (whose character is extremely fun to watch).  The question is: Why bring all of these stars along if you're not going to use them?  Secondly, why add more?  When Catherine Zeta-Jones came on the scene, everything went up in smoke.  Not only is her character a cheap copy of Rene Russo and Esther Canadas in the remake of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (the smart & sassy investigator combined with a great criminal's daughter), she is boring to watch in comparison to the other actors in the film who get far less screen time.  Moreover, I will not give it away, but bringing in Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis to play the parts that they do seems simply a contrived way to get more stars on the screen and disrupts the flow of the story.

Of course, OCEAN'S TWELVE is not without its good moments.  In particular, the flashback sequence when the audience finally learns how the squad pulls off the first robbery is dynamite and Matt Damon brings a real sense of humor to every scene that he is in.  I'd say that, overall, it is an average caper film right up until its closing minutes.  The final ""twist"" is not a twist at all, but rather a ""deus ex machina "" in order to have a nice and snazzy ending where our heroes end up on top.  The only problem: much of the footage we see in the closing sequence is absolutely new and does not merely expand what has gone before, it completely rewrites it.  One knows that they wanted to have a great ending to this film, but this ending is simply too crazy to pull off.  And that's saying a lot for an action film that has already required me to give up my grip on reality.  I would recommend OCEAN'S TWELVE as an average, Hollywood action film with plenty of unused star power.  Just don't expect to be wowed.",1115769600,,2999,4.333333333333333
2225754,1,B0007P0XBO,"Perfect proof that it takes more than just a bunch of ""stars"" to make a good movie, this piece of ""cinema"" lurches and drags from pointless to inexplicable to random to lame and back again.

Every supposed plot point is either a bald-face contrivance or a set piece apparantly intended to allow one of the many bit parts a chance to mug and/or gnaw on the scenery. The movie just kind of spins out of control in a disjointed and frenetic way from one major problem to the next, but faster than you can say Deus Ex Machina, some new character sweeps in from the sidelines to spin the film in yet another random direction.

Further, the editing is choppy and the film lacks any kind of strong narrative thread.

Screen time is also another issue for this film. With 12 title characters plus a small horde of supporting character actors to split time amongst, plus some gratuitous (and unnecessary) cameos, some terseness in coverage is understandable. However, the choices for focus in O12 defies explanation. Several of the characters are barely in the movie at all, several scenes have more time allocated to pregnant silences than is really necessary, and other scenes are cut short or rushed just as they're getting interesting, for no apparant reason.

Most of the putative 12 barely get any time at all, and in fact might as well not have been in the movie. Others were acted out more like cariacatures or cliches. Even major headliners Mac and Clooney are barely in the film, and Don Cheadle's fantastic talent is wasted. Brad Pitt had some screen time allocated to him, but he mostly sat or stood around smiling like a cheshire cat rather than actually contributing to the plot, and at times when he did speak he came off more like Tyler Durden than Rusty Ryan. Matt Damon comes away looking like the best of the set in as much as he seemed to be playing an actual character rather than just being himself, and was very watchable in his scenes, despite the fact that one of the movies most ridiculous and lame contrivances centers around his character's mother. Julia Roberts looked wan, and true to form her acting failed to impress me; though her staple ""fetchingly flustered and confused"" bit fits this role better than some others she's done.

As far as players outside of the 12, CZJ gets a huge amount of screen time, and her subplot is really the basic thread that the film is hung around, but its both predictable and irrelevant. Further her character comes equipped with either amazing precognitive powers or a copy of the script, because she always seems to instantly ken exactly whats going on -- and a good thing too because the audience sure is left in the dark a lot. An honorable mention goes out to Andy Garcia, who pulls Benedict off well; but really if Andy Garcia can't do a good mafioso type at this point in his career he must of been sleeping thru most of his filmography. Finally, the dastardly (invisible) mustache-twirling Nightfox is actually, for me, the most amusing character in the film despite being such a complete and total cliche. However he gets considerably less screen time than CZJ despite being both more central to the heist aspect of the plot and more interesting to boot.

Also, a good deal of the movie is given over to a series of running gag and inside jokes, only some of which work. The most annoying and oft-repeated running gag revolves around the Chinese member of the group droning on in Chinese, and the rest of the team understanding him. Once is funny, twice is cute, thrice is annoying. A more workable gag, which wasn't mined as much as it could have been, was the more experienced ""master"" thiefs and hooligans playing newbie jokes on Damon's ""apprentice"". The inside jokes took more of a breaking-the-4th-wall angle, including a really stupid bit involving Tess, played by Julia Roberts, masquerading as Julia Roberts. Yeah -- it's that bad. On the up side Bruce Willis has a funny (though pointless) cameo, with a good running gag about the 6th Sense spliced into it.

Finally, the movie is essentially a heist flick (well, in reality its actually a showcase for headliners masquerading as a heist flick), but the ""heist"", so-called, is both uninteresting and poorly related.  In fact, when the movie is over and you reflect back on it, the chain of events towards the end leading to a daisy chain of contrivances required to fuel the de riguer ""big twist"" is completely unnecessary within the context of the film, save has a plot fixer to enable the twist in the first place.

Anyway, in summary, this movie stinks on ice, and some decent acting here and there, lots of star power, and the fact that the stars are clearly having a good time doesnt change the fact that this movie could have been -- should have been -- a much better film.",1115596800,2,4804,4.662337662337662

Ocean's 12 is nothing like this. The film is in desperate need of a better editor, as it is so bloated and ponderous that towards the middle of the film, if you've even managed to keep track of who's stealing what from whom and why they're doing it, you won't even care any more. You'll just be begging for the ending.  The film is filled with bizarre camera angles, such as a shot of an incoming airplane that for some inconceivable reason is filmed sideways. There are also some very bizarre scenes, such as a scene where Julia Robert's character has to pretend to be Julia Roberts, and a thief break-dances through lasers.

However, the biggest flaw of the movie is the absence of a good heist scene. The heist in Ocean's 11 was masterful, and there is nothing in this film that even comes close. I didn't go to see this movie to watch a cop get reunited with her father who happens to be a master thief, I went to see a team of funny people go up against the odds to steal a lot of money.

For all the originality of the first, the storyline here seems incredibly forced.  It's like the writers were sitting around, looking for an excuse to make this film, and couldn't come up with anything beyond a vague echo of the first film.

The acting is fine, although the characters played by Clooney and Julia Roberts come off as annoying, more than anything else.

Clooney and Pitt also seem to have the jovial spirit going, and quite a few scenes with them together are bent on just reviving the old Ocean's eleven feel of comraderie. Such as when Clooney asks if anyone can guess how old he is, and when told he looks fifty, goes off in a huff and consiquently must pester everyone around to see if he really does look that old.

Catherine Zeta-Jones gets rather old and stale quickly though. Its irritating how she always seems one step ahead of Danny, and even though she hasn't known the group long.

The resulting mess is somewhat redeemed by the sheer star power, but even the sudden appearance of Bruce Willis cannot quite save a pivotal scene that plays on the fame of one of the stars.

Ocean's Twelve has a weak plot, bad writing, poor soft-focus photography, washed out colors, bad editing, weak direction and is a waste of mega-watt talent. It seems that the writers painted themselves into a corner and then decided to simply paint a door on the wall to escape a bad plot by using a non-existent technological solution that lacks imagination and is very disappointing. The film is generally incoherent with numerous time-sequence jumps that are difficult to follow.

Here is a message to all movie directors and reviewers: It is possible to be too eccentric.  Just like everyone else I found the first movie great, so much that I actually put it on my ""favorite movies of all time"" list.  The problem with Ocean's 12 does not solely lie in its copious eccentrics, but also with its weak storyline and inadequate ending.  I do applaud the makers of this movie for successfully getting all of the main characters back and a few new stars.

2225833,4,B0007P0XBO,"This is a fun caper film.  The movie works because of the way it uses the cast with attitude, style, and a lot of wisecracking humor.  Since there are so many in the cast, it is a real feat to make them all memorable, give them a reasonable amount of screen time and make sure that everyone has some good lines.

The trick in this kind of movie is to keep it similar enough to the first movie to keep the audience of the first one signing on to the new film, but different enough to not bore them.  Ocean's 12 has enough twists and turns to make it fun and enough self-knowledge to add some spice.  For example, a delicious part of the movie is using the similarity in appearance between Tess Ocean (played by Julia Roberts) and Julia Roberts to some effect in the film, even though her ears and nose and accent make it obvious she is NOT Julia Roberts.

This is not a great film, not even a great caper film.  But it is stylish, quick moving, doesn't resort to raunch, and gives its big cast some individual moments to act.  Carl Riener's scene sitting in front of the TV when his wife asks him what's wrong comes to mind immediately.  Watch his face during that scene.  Good work.

2225879,4,B0007P0XBO,"The Belagio heist left everyone wondering, did they really get away with it? Is that it? In fact they did, until a showoff thief from Amsterdam decided to try to prove his ability and ratted Ocean's eleven out to Mr. Benedict. This thief known only as the night fox told Mr. Benedict the location of the group of eleven who stole his money, on the condition of holding restraint as Mr. Benedict agreed.

  This was the beginning of the plot, but was it good enough? Oceans eleven was a hit a great movie loved by all, the ideas, the action and the creativity captured every audience member in attendance. So there was no doubt that the expectations for its sequel would by high, especially since it had all the returning stars like Brad Pitt and George Clooney.

  It was the night fox, thought of as the worlds greatest thief, against Ocean's eleven, and at first it seemed like they were on top as the were able to get into the well guarded house to steal the first stock paper, but that's when they hit a snag. That plan fell through and now they had no money and one week to get almost 200 million dollars. This was one of the highlights of this movie it provided a bigger conflict, which brought about more drama and action.

  It seems like that in this golden age of movie heaven that every sequel that comes out has higher expectations then what the director could create, especially if the movie had all the returning cast members. So maybe our expectations are too high. Although this was a great movie, and a hit at the box office, it just wasn't as entertaining and involved as it's original.

  The glamour and special attributes that were created in Ocean's Eleven made its sequel out to have higher expectations then it would if it wasn't a sequel, since, if this wasn't a sequel then it would have been a hit like Oceans Eleven was, but this was definitely a great movie that gave every movie watcher the continuation, of those involved in the great Belagio heist, that they had been waiting for, for a along time.",1113955200,,2030,4.486413043478261

Each character had a specific role to fill. You got to see every stage of the planning and execution, and it was just-plausible enough to work. The sequel, on the other hand:

PROs:

+ Starts out promising--good premise, and the first heist was fairly clever

+ Good chemistry between the actors, particularly between George Clooney and Brad Pitt

CONs:

- Many of the original Ocean's eleven weren't even used in this film--it mostly concentrated on Clooney's, Pitt's, and to a lesser extent Matt Damon's characters

- They play around with the timeline too often--everything's done as flashbacks or flashbacks within flashbacks. This gets confusing.

- The ""big heist"" they're supposed to pull off isn't nearly as cool as the first one. You don't witness too much of the planning, and the execution is completely boggled. Most of it is improvisation on the characters' part; they seem less ""in control"" of the situation as they did in the first movie.

- A few REALLY cheesy scenes--*SPOILER ALERT* Like the scene where Julia Roberts's character pretends to be Julia Roberts *END SPOILER*

- Qute a few unnecessary scenes and sub-plots--*SPOILERS* For example, the Bruce Willis cameo and the search for Isabel's father *END SPOILERS*

And George just has so much charisma and outlandish humor that it's almost enough to make you forget that this story just stinks. I very much wanted to love this film.

The DVD includes exactly one feature, the theatrical trailer.  I assume a more loaded DVD will be released in the future.  I enjoyed Ocean's 11 so much because of the interaction of the characters and the complicated stealing of the money from the Bellagio.  Ocean's 12 includes all the characters and the great interaction, but the heists are more of an afterthought.

Terry Benedict wants his money back from the first movie and evidently he is pretty convincing as a ruthless killer because all 11 guys decide they have to steal the money back.  They head to Europe where some thug supposedly has some jobs for them.  Once there, they intereact with new master criminals ""The Mark"" and the ""NightFox.""  The plot shifts to the background once again as the characters take over.  The amusing dialogue and slick cinematogrophy make this an enjoyable movie.

The one negative of this movie is Julia Roberts.

When this point comes into play, the movie comes to a standstill and I was left waiting for this painful interlude to conclude.

I don't think an excess of stars is what did this film in, though.  The actors continue to work well together - its a misguided script that is the biggest culprit.

Things take a turn for the worst right from the beginning, as we find that this time around they will be pulling off their heists in order to repay Benedict, the same man they defied against impossible odds in the first film.  This might have seemed like a good idea at the time, a way to defy the conventions of this kind of film, but its not carried out in a convincing way.  Even worse, the fact that Ocean's gang are reuniting out of fear this time puts a big damper on things.  There's an air of desperation about the gang this time, and it tends to undermine their sense of fun.  Not to mention it raises the question of how they ever got up the nerve to pull off that last big heist in the first place.  They owned Mr. Benedict in the last film, completely, yet this time around they are so afraid of him that they'll do just about anything to pay him back.

I could forgive all the careless storytelling if the sense of comraderie or the snappy banter that really carried the first film was still there.  Most of the time, it isn't, unfortunately.",1113523200,2,1393,4.2988505747126435
2225911,3,B0007P0XBO,"This sequel to 2001's hit movie ""Ocean's Eleven"" reunites director Stephen Soderbergh with its all-star cast, and even adds a couple of stars. Three years after they knocked over Las Vegas' Bellagio Casino, heist mastermind Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is living the straight and narrow with Tess (Julia Roberts), while the rest of the gang has scattered around the world. The Bellagio's vindictive manager Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) vowed to make the thieves pay, and now he has found them all. Benedict gives Ocean's Eleven two weeks to pay back the money they stole, with interest, or take their chances with his assassins. The guys don't have the money, so it's off to Europe to steal the necessary funds. A heist in Amsterdam puts an ambitious EuroPol agent, Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), on their trail. And Ocean's crew have unwittingly gotten themselves into a competition between thieves, but it's not clear who is challenging them or why.

The trouble with ""Ocean's Twelve"" is that director Stephen Soderbergh was apparently so preoccupied with his own cleverness that he forgot about the audience. I get the impression that everyone involved with the film participated for his or her own enjoyment, but the viewer is left in the cold. Audiences want to see an ingenious heist in a heist flick, but there is none here. Soderbergh has filled this film with A-list movie stars: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Julia Roberts. Yet he undermines their strengths by shooting indoor scenes in dim, orange, incandescent light, partially out-of-focus. We can't see the guys' faces, and Julia Roberts looks absolutely homely. At least Catherine Zeta-Jones looks good, if ridiculous, in leather power suits. The script is more nonsensical than is reasonable even in a cheesy heist flick. It consists mainly of disjointed meaningless conversations that are supposed to be funny. There are some awkward cameos by movie stars playing themselves. So we don't have a story, attractive stars, or a heist.

We do have style, for better or worse. Where ""Ocean's Eleven"" took inspiration from the story in the original 1960 film that starred Hollywood's Rat Pack, ""Ocean's Twelve"" embraces the style of the Swingin' Sixties. Shots flipped on their side, quick cutting, and mugging at the camera recall television of that era  ""Ocean's Twelve"" isn't bad light entertainment if you're looking for something that doesn't demand -or benefit from- your full attention. But constant reminders that the folks on the screen are having more fun that you are is off-putting.

2225912,3,B0007P0XBO,"I was sick while watching this film, I think it would've went over my head either way though. It's overly stylish with way too much camera movement. If you thought Bourne Supremcy had too much camera movement then you saw nothing until you see this. The plot makes no sense also. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) brings Ocean's 11 back together because he wants them to pay him back the money they stole. Someone here wrote that it would've saved a lot trouble if they just killed him. They're not killers though..they're thieves. Anyway the movie jumps all over place so much that it's impossible to keep up with it.

  I only recommend it because the cast is so good. They're so good that it's a shame that the script isn't better. Matt Damon and Brad Pitt shine the most. Surprisngly this is more of Pitt and Cathrin Zita Jones' film than it is George Clooney's. Hell Matt Damon even has more to do than him. The film spends too much time with Jones' cop character who's on the trail of them. I think it even spends more time showing her trying to catch them than it does explaining what it is they actually plan on doing. Plus why is it even called Ocean's 12 ? There is still only 11 of them. I guess it is called that due to the addition of Jones' to the cast but she's trying to catch them through most the movie. She's not part of their team.

  The scene that probably is the most entertaining is the one where Tess (Julia Roberts) poses as....Julia Roberts. I don't know how doing that is supposed to help get George Clooney and the others out of jail though. It's just meant to be funny I guess and it is. Most of the scenes in the movie you don't know what they are doing or why. The first one was much more involving. It's  disapointing how Steven Soderbergh approuched making this sequel.

The first installment was (though not the greatest movie of all time . . . . not even close)fun to watch if you didn't dig too deep, but the sequel flutters like an expiring balloon.  Andy Garcia hunts down all the evil-doers who ganked $160 million dollars from his Las Vegas casino in the first movie and gives them two weeks to pay all the money back, plus interest.  Which they all get together to do.  Now... am I missing the point here or could they just have had him whacked out and be done with it.  Short movie then, but at least more plausable.  Hell, he got the money back through his insurance.  And the fact that we're supposed to look at them as good little criminals who would never dream of killing anyone . . . where's Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro?  F*ck that!  All in all, it's pretty stupid and pretty pointless and the fact that it all boils down to a rivialry between the master of all French thieves and Ocean's Twelve really makes it hard to swallow.  Julia Roberts plays Tess pretending to be Julia Roberts and that's probably the most entertaining part of this whole movie.  That and Bruce Willis' cameo.  Far more movies out there to make this one look like what it was: a sad sequel to a mediocre movie with so much star-power that it detracts from everything else.

Besides the obvious actors such as Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Julie Roberts the film has great depth of supporting actors with minor parts.  Several of these small parts have actors that already have established themselves with major parts in other prestigious films.  For example, Johan Wideberg, a Swedish actor known from Oscar nominated All Things Fair (1995), Eddie Izzard and Robbie Coltrane all appear at some point in the film.  Next to these actors, the audience will of course also recognize Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould, Casey Affleck, and Vincent Cassel among many others.  Despite this enormous talent pool Ocean's Twelve does not succeed in creating a sublime cinematic experience, which will awestruck the audience.  Instead, the viewers get to experience a half-empty drama with good chemistry while the actors carry out an overtly planned design.

The story begins within Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his group ripped of in the predecessor, Ocean's Eleven.  Benedict demands that Ocean and his cohorts return all the money that was stolen from him with interest.  Initially, this idea for the sequel provides an interesting angle, but the interest quickly eradicates itself by trying to do too much on the screen without detail or feeling for the atmosphere.  In a hurried number of sequences the audience gets to follow Benedict's quick visits to all of Ocean's buddies, as he presents the idea that he will kill them unless they return the money.

Unfortunately, the film continues with lack of appealing intrigue, as no complex scheme will get them out of the mess with Benedict.  As an alternative, the film takes the audience to Europe where Ocean and his partners intend to find a way to steal the money that Benedict wants in less than two weeks.  Amusingly, the story brings them to plan the theft of a very valuable document from an eccentric loner who never leaves his highly secure mansion.  However, the document will not give them more than a couple of million, which is just a drop in the bucket of what they need.  This is a little absurd, as Ocean and his associates are aware of the feeble sum while they go on with an elaborated and most likely very time and monetary consuming plan to get the document.  Nonetheless, this is necessary, as it will lead the story to its next phase.

Fortunately, Ocean and his friends succeed in the break in, but someone has beaten them to it, as the thief before them was aware of them trying to steal the document.  However, this provides a connection for Ocean to who ratted on them to Benedict.  One name appears, the Night Fox, and now Ocean and his buddies are on the warpath to find this Night Fox.  Simultaneously, as they try to find the Night Fox, the Europol has placed them under surveillance. This is due to their recent breaking and entering into the loner's house.

Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) leads the unit that keeps the surveillance of Ocean and his friends' movement. To make things a lot more complicated, she used to be Rusty Ryan's (Brad Pitt) old girlfriend.  This seems to be both a problem and an advantage, as she has inside knowledge of how Rusty operates, but he knows how she thinks. In due time Isabel follows the group of skilled thieves to Rome, Italy.  In Rome, the audience gets to see the beginning of the big showdown, which brings some entertaining and amusing moments.

Steven Soderbergh directs a visual journey that moves rapidly from one scene to another in a manner, which feels constructed.  Nonetheless, the cinematography is brilliant where the audience gets to experience first-class visuals, which truly enhance the story.  The chemistry between the characters seems very authentic, maybe even a little too authentic at times, as it really feels as if they are good buddies.  The downside of the story is also the friendship, as it produces a feeling as if these guys are having a good time in Europe while shooting this film.  The audience never experiences any kind of anxiety or fear of death, as they know that they only have another two weeks to live if they do not raise the money, which seems very important to them.",1113436800,2,4359,4.846153846153846

The only thing is that you just can't go into this movie expecting more excitement than ocean's eleven. This is greatly due to the fact that ocean's eleven was in vegas and dealt with casino's which all in all is more exciting than any other plot.

2225952,2,B0007P0XBO,"All the superstar gang is back plus another one (Catherine Zeta-Jones,) and cameos from two others are thrown into the mix as well. You would think with all that star power the movie would be fairly good, but it is not. The movie seemed to try too hard to be better than the last. The film didn't portray the same magic and chemistry that was felt when these superstars got together last time. In fact it felt at times like they were faking it.

In the last film the chemistry felt natural and the script flowed well through the actors abilities. In Ocean's 12 there are scenes where the chemistry seemed to be forced upon you. For instance, when the gang is plotting their first heist of the film, the scene and script forced you to remember that all of these stars are in the same room. The scene involved a lot of cutting, which is okay, but it also involved a lot of arguing and lines spoken off camera. It is rather annoying.

In fact, a lot of the movie is filmed with all of Ocean's gang in the same room, talking and/or arguing instead of splitting camera time, showing each member, working on, or prepping for their part in the heist. This was an element of story telling that worked so well in the last film and it was forgotten in this film.

Much of the other part of the film focuses on introducing Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, her past and how her current status as a Europol (interpol?) agent fits into the story. And while building her character is important to the plot, it takes away too much time from Ocean's gang who are supposed to be the focus of the movie. This is what people who enjoyed the last  film no doubt came back to see and were ultimately denied seeing.

The plot itself is also forced. After all of Ocean and gang's meticulous planning in the first film, you would think that they would have also planned for the possibility that Terry Benedict {Andy Garcia) would want his money back and some revenge. Yet Ocean's 12 finds the gang in not so secret and others in extremely not so secret places. Benedict of course finds them with help from a secret source which if he was as evil as he was made out to be, should not have been needed. And now out of fear for their lives, Ocean and gang must pay back the money. To have this as the driving force of the movie is weak.

The only good thing is the humor is still there. And there is a lot of subtle humor that some people might not pick up on. It is in these humorous scenes where some of the magic from the first film comes through.

If you are a fan of the last film (I am), you will desperately want to find ways to like this film (I did). But ultimately you will be disappointed (I was). This is a same day rental only.",1113350400,4,2712,4.264591439688716
2225953,3,B0007P0XBO,"Remember the chuckle you got during the end credits of ""Ocean's Twelve"" when it said ""Introducing Julia Roberts as Tess""?  Keep that in mind when you watch ""Ocean's Twelve"" because it is playing off of that joke that this Steven Soderbergh's sequel has its best moments.  There have been films whose greatest crime was substituting style for substance, but in this 2004 film it is star power that makes up for the last of substance.  If came back to gawk at the stars then you will enjoy this movie a lot more than if you are back to watch the gang pull off another complicated heist.  They have to do that this time because Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) has tracked down all eleven of the gang members and told them he wants his money back (with interest).  So Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) are putting the gang together and looking for a big job they can pull off before their deadline.

If there is one lesson we learned from watching ""Ocean's Eleven"" it was to assume that EVERYTHING that happens is part of the master plan.  Of course, the goal in the first film was to fake the viewer out as much as Terry Benedict.  Soderbergh knows that and knows that we know that and hopes that we do not know that he knows that we know that so that he can play with our minds once again.  That is indeed the goal, but this film stops short of even making it to the red zone.  It is just that everybody is having such a good time they never really notice that this movie is barely a pale imitation of the original (remake), which is underscored when the cast is once again going through all those made up names for players and capers.  Inviting such comparisons to ""Ocean's Eleven"" is not always a good thing in this movie, because it always loses out.

That is not to say that the cast is not engaging.  They throw Catherine Zeta-Jones into the mix so that she can fulfill the same role with Brad Pitt that Julia Roberts played for George Clooney in ""Ocean's Eleven.""  But compare the characters in the two films and you will find that Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac and the rest having absolutely nothing in this film like the set pieces they had the first time around.  Everybody had their moment to shine in the first film, but in the second they are more likely to be sitting around in a jail cell.  If there was one thing they would have wanted to duplicate here it was those set pieces.  But instead of Bernie Mac persuading somebody to sell him some vans we get him being miffed about the gang being called Ocean's Eleven.  At least he gets that moment because some of the others get a lot less than that little bit and that is a big shame.

The other problems are that when we get to the big revelation at the end we have two reactions, each of which is rather fatal to our enjoyment of the film.  The first is that the payoff was not worth the confusion.  Certainly it is not half as interesting as the caper in the original (remake).  The second is that the final revelation is essentially a cheat, offering a radical interpretation of the prior events to show how they done did it this time around.  In trying to do the same thing but in a different way to try and get away with it the second time the end product is a film where the best say you can say for the production is the cast got to spend time shooting in Europe.",1113350400,46,3359,4.3052464228934815

2225978,4,B0007P0XBO,"With big budget, star-studded casts like the one in Ocean's Twelve, there is always the danger of having them look too smug and self-indulgent instead of having fun along with the audience. Ocean's Eleven managed to straddle this line quite well, resulting in an entertaining popcorn movie. Director Steven Soderbergh kept his cast in check, never letting them go too far over-the-top and shooting it with a style that was always interesting to watch. The big question for the sequel is if he could pull of the same feat without repeating himself too much.

If the first film was about Danny's redemption by reconciling with Tess, then Ocean's Twelve is about Rusty's (Pitt) redemption by reconciling with his past love, Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones), a determined Interpol agent. It elevates the movie ever so slightly above the standard heist story by giving everything that happens a somewhat poignant spin.

Once again Soderbergh keeps the pace brisk and breezy, making the two-hour running time fly by. Like its predecessor, Ocean's Twelve is beautifully shot with atmospheric lighting, an eclectically groovy soundtrack from British DJ David Holmes (that evokes a `60s Euro-lounge vibe) and tight editing that makes it stylistically consistent with the first movie. Soderbergh is an excellent visual storyteller and this is evident in several scenes that he depicts without any dialogue, instead resorting to music married to visuals that conveys exactly what's going on. He understands the kind of movie he's making and doesn't try to be too cute or wink knowingly at the audience, instead focusing at the task at hand: making a confident, entertaining movie. Granted, Ocean's Twelve is no Traffic (2000) but you could do a lot worse with two hours of your time.",1113177600,2,1766,5.149825783972125

Zeta-Jones plays her part to perfection and the interplay between the characters was just as good as the two films I've already mentioned.

2226002,3,B0007P0XBO,"There is a common maxim in Hollywood that a sequel will probably make 50 - 70% of the money the original made. This is why a huge hit is almost always guaranteed to spawn a sequel.

`Ocean's 11' was a fun, glittery romp through Vegas featuring a huge list of stars. The film made a lot of money and all of the A-List celebrities had a great time making the film with director Steven Soderbergh. A sequel was inevitable.

`Ocean's 12' is about 50 - 70% as good as the original. If this is good enough for you, please purchase your DVD through Amazon or rent through Netflix. It isn't good enough for me.

All of the stars are back and Catherine Zeta-Jones has joined the crew for their new romp, this time, through Europe. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the mark in `11', wants his money back. He searches out each of the people in Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) troupe and threatens them into returning his money, with interest. Rusty (Brad Pitt) and Danny gather the gang to figure out who or what they can rob. Everyone is back, because everyone owes money to Benedict. Linus (Matt Damon) remarks that they are too hot to pull any jobs in the US and the kind of money they need means a big job. They head to Europe. Amsterdam. Rusty has his eye on a reclusive mark who owns the original stock certificate of the Dutch Trading Company. The mark is extremely paranoid of being robbed, so his house is safe. Or is it... Oh, let's face it, with the A-List stars assembled for `12', you probably aren't there to see a great story. Unfortunately, the filmmakers seem to have realized this as well.

Let's set aside the implausibilities in the screenplay for a moment. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould and all of the rest are back. They are pretty much the same characters they were in the previous film. They like each other. They don't take anything too seriously. They are ready to have some fun and they know they will win. This isn't really a film about performances either. Julia Roberts' character, Tess Ocean, actually impersonates a pregnant Julia Roberts in one scene. It's this kind of wink, wink fun that made the first film such fun. It also captured the spirit of the original starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. perfectly. While making the original, the Rat Pack performed concerts at nightclubs, gambled and then shot the film, in that order.

Unfortunately, because the caper stuff is practically non-existent and we know that nothing will ever truly affect any of the stars of `12', we have to like the Wink Wink Nudge Nudge stuff they concoct in order for the film to be a success. The previously mentioned bit about Julia Roberts playing herself is amusing, for a few moments, but it wears thin very quickly. Clooney is very cool and aloof. Nothing, I repeat nothing, ever seems to be giving him the upper hand or causing him to lose any sleep. Pitt is a mirror image of Clooney. They did add a little wrinkle for his character. He has had a relationship with Zeta-Jone's international cop. This seems to be the central relationship in the film and it work's ok, but it also highlights the fact that nothing else is going on with the rest of the cast.

Let's address the screenplay for a moment. The film is filled with the most ridiculous implausibilities. Naturally, the first thing you should do if you are trying to keep a low profile is to purchase a well-known hotel, on the Sunset Strip, in West Hollywood, which is frequented by television and movie stars. Pitt's character, Rusty. does this. It also leads to one of the funniest lines in the entire film.

The story is convoluted and filled with some of the most ludicrous plans I have ever seen. This would be completely acceptable if there were anything new going on as well. Instead, we get to watch the pretty actors on their European holiday.

For long periods of time, many of the b-level characters simply disappear. Conveniently, they are locked up, allowing the few who are free to bring Robert's character into the action.

Also, there is a rather pathetic attempt to make Zeta-Jones' character more dramatic. The subplot is so wane that it appears to have been tacked on, at the last minute. The only good thing about this aspect of the story is to watch one of the actors involved, but it doesn't come until the very end.

""Ocean's 12"" is barely acceptable because everyone is clearly enjoying themselves. Would I rather watch a bad film in which everyone is enjoying themselves or a bad film in which everyone appears miserable? I'll take the former.

Much like ""11"", the sequel uses a lot of locations and this adds a bit to the polished look of the film. First in Amsterdam, then Rome, the film moves around with a wild abandon, again, paying little attention to the story.

Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of ""12"" is that the director, Soderbergh, displays very little of the cinematic flair he is known for. In his earliest films, he presented the story in an almost Cubist way. Little bits of the narrative would be jumbled up, or there would be small shifts between the dialogue and the actual scene we were watching. For instance, in ""Out of Sight"", Clooney's character is talking to someone on the phone, off screen, as we watch he and Jennifer Lopez share dinner on screen. It is an interesting and effective way to speed up the action and enrich the story. As Soderbergh has gained more and more acclaim, and made films with bigger and bigger budgets, he seems to be slowly abandoning this style. There was a little of it in ""Erin Brockovich"" and in ""Ocean's 11"". There is almost none of it in ""12"". Instead, ""12"" is a fairly standard-looking big budget Hollywood film.

You find out that the bet was won at the beginning of the movie, but then they did this massive plot to fool the guy, and you think, ""huh?""

2226019,4,B0007P0XBO,"2001's Ocean's Eleven was a witty and clever remake of the 1960s Frank Sinatra classic. It featured a classy and glamorous cast of popular Hollywood icons including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, Matt Damon and the lovely Julia Roberts. Directed by the talented Steven Soderbergh(Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich), it became a worldwide hit crime caper movie recognized for its sharp dialogue and flairing style. Three years later, in 2004, nearly the entire wonderful cast of the first installment return along with exuberant director Steven Soderbergh, who this time travel all through Europe in search of riches. Professional thief Danny Ocean(Clooney), and his filthy-rich team of brilliant experts, which includes Rusty Ryan played by a cool Brad Pitt, and Tess Ocean, Danny's wife who would rather stay in the shadows about the con business, here played by the gorgeous megastar Julia Roberts. This time,though, they' re not stealing for their own sake, as the slick thieves have been threatened by casino master Terry Benedict, who gives them a limited amount of time to recooperate the money they originally stole from him in the first film or he promises to take care of the team in a grisly and unpleasing manner. The stakes are set higher this time around, as the gang travels through Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris looking for a way to steal millions of dollars so they can live, and also encounter a rival and increasingly jealous sly con artist(Vincent Cassel) who is making their alreday skillful jobs a little more difficult. The backdrops and scenery are lush, fresh, and vibrant bringing life to an already colorful film. The performances are magnificent, thanks to undeniable star power that blends flavorful character opera with rich and detailed situations their characters are placed in, and there are some intriguing cameos to spice things up. There are some brisk although tense chase and action scenes to keep the pace lively. Overall a worthy sequel to a savvy and thrilling predecessor. An entertaining and juicy heist dramedy that features Catherine Zeta-Jones who is absolutely fabulous in her role as a cunning and beautiful international detective hot on the criminal mastermind's trail. Steven Soderbergh has a keen eye for kinetic direction, with eye-catching shots of European city streets, pitch-perfect editing, and an outrageously interesting screenplay that will keep you experiencing loads of fun. All these elements are combined to create a glorious caper movie that will satisfy artistic moviegoers, and has sheer quality and entertainment value that is utterly enjoyable. The only bonus feature on the DVD version will be the film's original theatrical trailer that sparked anticipation for a movie that deserved attention. The DVD edition will be available in seperate Fullscreen and Anamorpic Widescreen formats.

Words can not describe how shockingly bad this movie is.  The movie itself is not a sequel and does not in any way attempt to provide a seamless follow-up to Oceans 11.

First up we have a bunch of overpaid posers (Clooney, Pitt etc ) standing around and cracking jokes yet trying to look ""important"".  There is NO script, NO plotline and no attempt by any of the ""actors"" to make their roles the slightest bit believable. Secondly, the movie is an INCOHERENT MESS with such poor direction one can't help wondering if this movie was produced by a five year old - it is THAT BAD.

To make matters worse, the movie looks like it was shot by an epileptic with a $20 Sony Handycam - it was painfully bad and looked cheap.

I'm sorry to say this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  It was so sickeningly bad that I walked out of the cinema half way.  The ironic thing though is the fact that the ""actors"" were having the last laugh at the audience - since the heist was on them for being so damn stupid for paying money to see this colossal piece of garbage.

Don't waste your money or time on the DVD no matter how much crap is stuffed on it.  I'd rather use is as a frisbee or drink coaster.",1110844800,5,1221,4.113924050632911
2226022,2,B0007P0XBO,"'Ocean's Twelve' has committed many typical mistakes when Hollywood studios fail to come up any new ideas, but still want to make a movie quickly.  OK, let me tell you one by one:

A) THE DISJOINTED PLOT (or making an unnecessary sequel).  Right, we don't need this.  We already have slick, stylish 'Ocean's Eleven' so why make this one?  Add to this question, what's the point of this new '12' anyway?  George Clooney and other guys came back.  Right, and Andy Garcia's (last time) humiliated casino owner came back, who wants his money back.  So Ocean and his pals have to pull off another heist in Holland, in order to pay the cash quickly.  So far, OK.

BUT. hey, anyone, can you summerize this?  The film next introduces another (French) crook Vincent Cassel, and another retired crook, and Catherine Zata Jones's female investigator (from 'Europole', and she happens to know Brad Pitt's character ... how convenient), and many cameos from Hollywood, including Bruce Willis as himself.  And Julia Roberts flies to the place when Ocean's men are in trouble, all the way from America.  To prove what?  I still do not know.

B) EUROPEAN LOCATIONS.  And they went out of USA, to travel to such places as Rome and Amsterdam.  That means there is no gorgeous, glittering feeling of Las Vegas, the town which no doubt helped create the stylish mood of the original.  But anyway, the entire cast must have had fun.

C) SO MANY CAMEOS and references to other films.  If you don't have good idea, get cameos.  It's easy, you pay just a little (by the standard of Hollywood), the stars work only a day or two, and the audiences will be amused.  That's what some people are thinking.  So, besides the star of 'Pulp Fiction' you see Eddie Izzard, Robbie Coltrane, Jared Harris, Albert Finney, Jeroen Krabbe, Topher Grace ... should I continue?  Plus, there are many film references, none of which are as amusing or intelligent as Tarantino.

Am I too harsh?  Maybe or maybe not.  But I am sure that what was good in '11' is all missing in '12.'  Maybe you still call it a 'dream team' with Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac.  But they forgot one thing, and that's imagination.  Perhap, just perhap, but Steven Soderbergh lost it, and something else got into his head instead.",1110844800,13,2296,4.681704260651629

2226025,3,B0007P0XBO,"Cool, funny tagline.

Then the reality of the movie sets in.  It isn't as sharp and cool as the first one.  The script for ""Twelve"" was written as a separate film, but it was adapted for the ""Eleven"" characters to make it ""Eleven""'s sequel.

The heists aren't as clever or fun, and there are bigger and looser story element loose ends.  For example, Ocean's crew didn't want to try to steal a mask (or whatever it was) because the museum's random-movement laser beam security made even attempting it futile.  But the competing thief had no qualms about it.  His goofy-looking yoga exercises we saw here and there paid off in his choreographed movement through the laser beams.  But it was a cheat.  It didn't look like he was in any kind of danger - it looked too smooth (not unlike in ""Attack of the Clones"" when Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are shooting at the evil robot army.  They were filmed on a green-screen stage shooting at nothing, and the baddies were added months later.  So, you don't see any degree of tension on their faces or sense of palpable danger -- the baddies were positioned in front of their laser fire, so it just looked like Portman and Christensen were playing a video game).

Same in ""Twelve"" -- the limber thief just looked like he was casually moving through.  Too casually.  And then there would have been the problem with him doing it again, carrying the mask, to get out.

It was too conveniently resolved in the film.  No tension.

But this movie was meant to be a light-hearted romp, not a serious caper film, right?  It looked mostly like a travelogue film for Amsterdam.

At least the in-jokes were reasonably funny.

This movie only gets 3 stars, and I don't care what the DVD has on it.  It was a disappointing sequel, worth watching out of curiosity and that's about all.

I will say this, though --- Catherine Zeta-Jones has NEVER looked better on film than she did here.  No lie.",1110585600,,1932,4.568513119533527

The plot wasn't great, I didn't see why they had to pay him back in the first place; why didn't they just trick/decieve/evade him just like they did in the first one?  There was way too much emphasis on paying Benedict back.  In addition, there was no main heist as in the first one, so I found myself scratching my head as to what they were doing and why.  The ending was really twisty, as well as total bull, but I'm not gonna spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.  All in all, it lacked a lot of the smoothness that the first one had.

The bloodlines of this franchise have been diluted more than European royalty.

Take Ocean's Twelve for what it is: an entertaining heist movie with a fairly porous plot that nevertheless yields some good moments. High art it is not, but I found myself enjoying the ride while it lasted.

Watching Oceans 12 - you get the feeling the actors are holding a mirror arm length to see themself in view instead of any unfolding of a meaningful character attachment. (Actors with a brain and not for the $paycheck should have stayed far away from this project)

Is this the producers idea? Lets make sequals that are fast on production, get the swelled ego gang together (the public will buy it, they buy anything) and lets spend that time showing to the celebrity junkies our crew - so wonderful to look at any real story line will go without notice (give me a break - not interesting)... And of course the Math -> Ocean's 12 - will make money with high expense - 'as long as it makes money'.

The public will only buy into these charades so many times.  In this case a re-manufactured presentation to put a film out - without regard to quality.

2226031,4,B0007P0XBO,"After thoroughly enjoying Ocean's Eleven, my expectations were pretty high for this film.  In spite of all the negative reviews, I really enjoyed the sequel as well, and I felt it did justice to its predecessor.

This film (and the first, for that matter) are all about suspension of disbelief.  An all-star cast makes it even harder for this to happen.  But anyone who judges this film by the standard of believability will certainly be disappointed.  The plot is clever and fun, if a bit far-fetched, and the shooting locations make the film enjoyable  and add a lot of interest.  (I loved the heist in Amsterdam!)  The witty script, the beautiful scenery, and the clever plot made this film very fun and entertaining.  I believe, however, that it has more merit in regard to entertainment than it does as a piece of art; it's all about having fun -- not a work of cinematic profundity.  And if you don't like the stars, and your stomach churns at the idea of Hollywood doing a parody of itself, then this movie is definitely not for you.  Tess does indeed impersonate Julia Roberts, which I found amusing, but if you're not prepared to laugh at things like this, I'd advising picking out another film.

One of my favorite things about both Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve is the fact that they never use violence to accomplish a heist.  The use of creativity over violence really made both movies stand out against most similar films that Hollywood puts out these days, and actually made the characters more endearing.  I loved the 'reveal' section in the end, too, especially the part where they show how the 'Night Fox' accomplished his part -- it was very funny and I am not going to spoil it, but in my opinion, it made it worth sitting through the film.  The 'surprise' at the end was a true testament to the cleverness of the plot.

So, if you are looking for an entertaining, clever film with a sense of humor, with fun locations and a bit of mystery, check out Ocean's Twelve.",1109376000,,1989,4.592067988668555
2226032,2,B0007P0XBO,"Ever seen a film with 86 endings? No? Well should the urge ever overcome you, Oceans's Twelve is the only film that refuses to just wrap up the 'plot' for good. There are about a zillion climaxes that are all anti-climatic. Steven Soderbergh couldn't even get one of them right?

Andy Garcia comes back and demands that Ocean's 11 give him back the money they stole, plus extra. So they go off to Europe to steal things by not stealing them and not really planning anything at all. The whole film is made up of narcissistic filler. Ooooohh it's all so sophisticated and cool isn't it? Puh-lease.

This movie shouldn't have been made. Ocean's Eleven may have worked well but Twelve was taken from a non-related script called 'Honor Among Thieves' and adapted into a sequel, that no one asked for. So how do you go about cramming in 12 main characters into a story that did not have 12 main characters? You can't.

As a result Ocean's 12 never interact all at once. Several characters are left with nothing to do, forgotten about, stand about like idiots, fight for even a couple of lines of dialogue (all sarcastic, self-aware, nausiatingly 'cool' dialogue btw), disappear, reappear, wonder what the hell they're doing, forget who they are etc...

It's just plain horrible and too convoluted and contrived for its own good. The whole film seems out of order and you are frequently left wondering what on earth is going on. This elitist, condescending attitude makes us feel like the movie was made for the cast instead of us.

Plus Julia Roberts looks dreadful in this. She's very pale and thin and gaunt-looking. I thought I was looking at Skeletor to begin with. And if you don't believe how sickeningly 'clever' the film thinks it is, a certain plot development has Julia Roberts play Tess Ocean playing Julia Roberts (oh stop, that's too ingenious for my feeble, average movie-goer mind). Somehow Catherine Zeta Jones comes off a prettier, if not a better actress (I do NOT like Catherine Zeta Jones-but she was an exception here when compared to the Plain Jane Julia Roberts) as her accent is still all over the place.

The only good bit about the film is Vincent Cassell in a small supporting role as a master thief (like everyone else in the film). Funny how his one character is more interesting than a dozen others combined. Plus, we actually get to see him do stuff other than stand around. Which helps.

Don't waste your time with this film. Life is too short and there are other, better, shorter movies than this out at the moment. Ocean's Twelve is a dirty dozen.",1109376000,15,2575,4.671081677704194

The meta-narrative about Tess being a Julia Roberts look-alike is undeniably funny. What is not funny is Bruce Willis following her around, reminding her what good friends they are. Like the rest of the story, it would have been funny and effective enough on its own, but Soderberg just had to push that much further.

I agree with another reviewer here that it's also too long. But the indulgence is what sank it for me. It really is a flashy, extravagant party that you are pointedly not invited to. At least the first, for all its silliness, was accessible. This one's a train that left the station an hour before you got there.

It seems and tries to be a very polished movie but somehow I didn't like anything about it except the time when the credits roll. Its a big banner film and features some of the biggest names in Hollywood.

My point : So What? THere's absolutely no story in this movie. The ones of you frowning while reading this please note that its nothing but a plot to prove how clever some film makers can be. All in all it falls flat on its face.
The ever so gorgerous,Catherine Zeta Jones in this film looks like she doesnt even belong to it. The time she's playing Miss Clever Detective made me sink in my seat in the theater.

Brad Pitt , sadly in this movie is all about expressions, running around beautiful cities and getting arrested. He eats a few chocolates and snacks here and there. Tries to do his jiggs, wears an awesome suit that fits him like second skin. He hits on girls and tries to play Mr. Cute. He's still tolerable.

Moving on , Geroge Clooney's got older and his cute boy image just won't work as far as this film goes. He bores with his silence cause he has nothing better to do in the film. I expected a lot from this film. Its one of those ""Oh look everyone's going for it. It has to be a good film"" Sadly this bored me.

I liked the short Asian guy not because he's shorter than me but he wasn't as drowing in pretence as the other characters in this movie were.
Julia Roberts and her acting in this film was anything but consequential. She should have sat out the entire film than introduce us to her new boring self. I absolutely can't stand how fake she is the scene on the swing with Clooney towards the end of the film.
Matt Damon is a saving face. He seems like someone who managed to pull this from a One Starrer to a Two Starrer. Sadly there's not much of the neat guy. I thought the one scene where he quotes the lyrics of the mesmering ""Kashmir"" was actually quite funny. I noticed how the film maker tries to create the impression that a lot is happening throughout the length of the film. It amuses me how accurate it is in its monotony.

In any case , opinions come and opinions go. I might try to sound like I'm saving my @$$ when Im saying this but a lot of fools and wanna be's all over the cities liked the film. So did the intellects and the outstanding unachieving achievers. Even my girl friend who saw this along with me,liked it. So would you render my opinion as useless? Gimme a Break!

On the other hand, you could say that this is like a case of ""Kill Bill 1"" and ""Kill Bill 2"" where the idea is the same, the characters are the same, but you have two films that are quite different from one to the next.  Tarantino, however, more than succeeded in his Kill Bill vision because no one can deny the seamlessness from the first film to the second film.  Between ""Ocean's Eleven"" to ""Twelve"" however is a certain span of time where certain things transpire.  And while the film takes a good run at bringing us all up to speed, we can sense in the opening minutes that the group has kind of lost its initial magic.

However, this is nitpicking in my opinion.  What I think happened here is that director Soderbergh wanted to make his own original ""Ocean's Eleven"" movie (remember the first was based off an old rat-pack flick starring Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis jr, and Peter Lawford).  The plot makes sense; Terry Benedict, the hammerhead shark who owns everything that Danny and his bunch robbed in the last flick, recovers from his losses and goes practically door-to-door to all the members of the eleven and demands his money back, with interest.  Of course, the fact that they pulled a fast one on him doesn't make him less intimidating, in fact he's scary as hell now.  They regroup and decide that America is totally red-flagged for them right now, so they move their entire operation to Europe to pull off one huge job to pay back everything Benedict wants.  The only problem is that Rusty's old girlfriend happens to be a detective now, and she's right on their trail.  Soderbergh does a great job of bringing us up to speed, and reigniting the spark between the members of Danny's elite group.

When they pull the heist though, things don't exactly go as planned.  Someone called the ""Night Fox"" (if I remember correctly) has beaten them to the punch.  This is Europe's version of the ultimate cat-burglar, played by Vincent Cassel, who taunts Danny at first, and then decides to go head-to-head with him to see who is the ultimate thief.  The only thing greater than Toulour's chances of winning is Danny's unflinching confidence, and Soderbergh goes through the script with his man always at #1.

His script, though, is a bit more worldly than his first, and incorporates a few scenes that would have no place in the first film.  Take for example the scene where Vincent Cassel, as Toulour, does a Capoeira dance in the patio of his mansion situated on a beautiful European landscape.  It's very intersting to watch, and Cassel does a wonderful job, but it's not ""Cool, baby"" like the first film.  I'd imagine a scene like this would have hit the cutting room floor in editing on the first film.  Also, what about the scene at the end where (spoiler coming) Rusty takes Isabel to see her long-lost father at the end, and we have this touching, quiet moment in a old Mediterranean setting, where the ocean waves (Ocean, get it?) lap gently against the beach.  Yeah fine, touching, but why?  It doesn't belong if you're trying to make a cool film.  Ah ha!  Maybe Soderbergh wanted to take this film franchise a step further, into what he thinks might be more sophisticated cinema, and incorporated scenes like this, that are a bit more dramatic?

I'm going to have to disagree with you on that...  They may be dramatic and perhaps more ""arthouse"" to a certain extent, but I'm not convinced they belong in a film about a bunch of cats who pull off heists, steal expensive stuff, and get away clean, which in the history of cool may well be one of the coolest things to ever exist, besides rock n' roll.

Granted, there are some great moments in this film, like how about when Linus (who has spent the greater portion of the film trying to prove he's ready to work on his own terms) discovers that the person who bailed he and his friends out of jail was his mother?  Classic.  Damon is actually quite crucial to the proceedings here.  He tries, he stumbles, he acts ambitious and confident, but seething below is an unprepared, very green young kid, who is still a bit bleary eyed at the big, bright world around him.  There's another scene in a cafe where Rusty, Danny and Matsui (Robby Coltrane) are speaking in ""code"" about a heist they plan to pull.  Of course the stuff is ludicrous, it's just a ruse to throw off Linus who tries like crazy to decipher what they're saying.  When it comes time for him to talk; he looks at Danny and Rusty hopefully, then turns to Matsui and recites lyrics from ""Stairway to Heaven.""

By the way, Bruce Willis shows up, and can you believe nobody asks him when he is going to retire?  What a wasted opportunity.

It leaves the franchise in a strange place.  The ending indicates that they all went back to Vegas, scot free this time, and have the time of their lives.  Maybe if there's an ""Ocean's Thirteen"" it'll be in Vegas, maybe this time with a bit less dram-uh, and a bit more of that sweet, swingin' stuff baby.",1108684800,3,5407,4.576323987538941

2226052,4,B0007P0XBO,"Anyone who doesn't like having to think when they see a heist movie (the horror) should skip Ocean's 12.  God forbid you should have to fill in a few of the blanks yourself, right?  Well, that's what Soderbergh and co. have done with this sequel to Ocean's 11.  Be warned:  it *does* make you think, and you probably won't understand all the disparate pieces of the plot on your first viewing.  But I thoroughly enjoyed having to add it all up - and being that I actually do have two brain cells to rub together, it wasn't that hard to figure out in the end.

Brace yourself:  Ocean's 12 is NOT the same film as Ocean's 11 (go figure).  The heist itself is secondary, the focus being on Rusty Ryan and ex-flame Isabele Lahiri, but everything really does make sense at the end if you have a little patience and pay attention.  It took me three viewings to get all the pieces in place; but then, I *enjoy* watching movies more than once, especially when they're brain-teasers.

Contrary to a lot of negative reviews, I loved the script.  It was witty, snarky, fast-paced and definitely equal to Eleven.  With such a large cast the division of screen time isn't equal, but remember that it was by and large the CAST'S decision to make this movie at all, so they obviously have no complaints.  It's an ensemble, with the bigger names admittedly getting more of the limelight, but I believe there is enough screen time shared around for everyone to shine.  Which they all do; nobody misses a beat, including new additions Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel.  Even Julia Roberts is great, and I don't even *like* her.

As for all the complaints about the smug self-congratulation and supposedly unfathomable in-jokes - sorry, I didn't see any of that.  What I saw was a large group of people obviously having a fantastic time on screen together, poking fun wherever possible and turning out a pretty clever and entertaining movie in the process.  It pulled the wool over my eyes, and it was great fun.

I'm not saying the movie doesn't have flaws; every movie has flaws.  Thinking quickly, some of the camerawork is choppy and yes, a single viewing probably won't be enough time to get all the storyline in place.

2226053,4,B0007P0XBO,"""Ocean's 12"" is nearly as much fun as Steven Soderbergh's 2002 film ""Ocean's 11"". This is, of course the sequel to ""Ocean's 11"". The main problem with this movie is that it goes on a bit too long. Clockin in at 135 minutes, there are too many things going on and the last act is completely confounding. In a way, this movie reminded me of the recent ""Ladykillers"" remake, in that it has comically inept criminals doing things that they rally can not do. But ""Ocean's 12"" is less of a caper comedy like its predesecsor was, and more of an action caper. There are no amazing shootouts or daring car chases/races/or crashes, but there is a large amount of heists, some that are involved in mechanics or outrageous stunts. So, that said, I think that ""Ocean's 12"", while funny and quite entertaining, could have been shortened by 15 or 20 minutes. I thought that Catherine Zeta Jones' character was not that well established, and the writers (perhaps purposefully) left it to the audience to figure out why she was even there!",1106438400,8,1022,4.6208791208791204

2226076,1,B0007P0XBO,"Ocean's 11, both the 1960 and 2001 version, are entertaining, star-studded vehicles that have an interesting and engaging plot in addition to the stellar cast. Ocean's 12 also resembles one of the old Rat Pack films. Unfortunately, it resembles the Rat Pack films Sargeant's Three, Four for Texas and Robin and the Seven Hoods. Namely, it's a film with which the producers figured they had enough star wattage to overcome a terrible screenplay. But all the king's horses (or the chairman of the board's, for that matter) can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.

The ""plot"" is that Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is back, he's mad and he wants the money back that Ocean's Eleven stole from him in the first film. In addition to the crew from the first film, we have the stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones, who hopefully had the sense to at least realize that she was attached to a dud before filming wrapped. The cast goofs its way around the screen for two hours, figuring that since they had such a ball filming this 120 minute cast party, the audience will have a ball as well even though the script is trash. However, all the film has to offer is some location footage in Europe, a bunch of warmed-over, unexciting capers and a lame new adversary (Vincent Cassel). All this is made even more surprising by the presence in the director's chair of Steven Soderbergh. It's shocking to realize that the force behind Sex, Lies and Videotape, Erin Brockovich and Traffic would allow himself to be attached to this aimless, formless, boring romp.

Perhaps the low point in the film comes when Julia Roberts, as Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) wife, Tess, impersonates ... you guessed it ... Julia Roberts. The audience is treated to fifteen minutes of the most painfully self-congratulatory in-jokes about Roberts and her tics. Bruce Willis shows up in a painful cameo to make sure that even more star power is slapped on the script's cheesy situation. I guess, in Ocean's 13, Brad Pitt, as his character Rusty Ryan, is going to impersonate Brad Pitt and run into Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston at the same time as hilarity ensues.(NOT!)

I really wish this stinker hadn't done as well at the box office as it has. Had this film been a flop, the producers would have (1) stopped the series at two films or (2) if they had decided to continue, would have been forced to invest as much time and effort into the script as they did cramming as many stars into the cast roster as possible. It's a lazy, sluggish, uninspired exercise from a lot of people who have the talent to do much, much, much better -- just like the later Rat Pack films. I liked the original and bought it on DVD and was looking forward to the sequel.

2226079,3,B0007P0XBO,"This film is top class entertainment, but not in the same style as Ocean's 11. The former was stylish and slick with George Clooney leading the pack, losing none of the sexiness he had in his ER days. However, this time around, Zeta Jones is at the forefront as she spars with Brad Pitt. Because of this, the dynamic has to change. It does work to a certain extent though but this feature doesn't seem to have the spark of the first one.

Brad Pitt is just gorgeous and plays his part of Rusty Ryan well but I cannot help feeling he didn't get as good of a deal as Clooney did in the first one. The relationship between him and Zeta Jones feels forced in this story and Pitt deserves better than that.

The jokes are funny and pack the right punches - undoubtedly an integral part of the film but I do think that the only problem is that some members of Ocean's 12 are left out such as Don Cheadle's character, Bernie Mac's and Scott Caan/Casey Affleck's characters, who in the first film were funnier than this one. Also, what about Andy Garcia. It feels as if he is on the periphery when he should be at the forefront? In order for the film to be really tight, all the characters should have had equal share of the action and the jokes and it just didn't happen in this film, Bernie Mac in prison for half of it? - what was that about?

Zeta Jones is successful physically as the sexy detective but in spirit, she's too wooden. Clooney taking a back seat in this in film is sorely felt. It isn't Rusty Ryan's 12 or Lahiri's 12, it is his pack so it kind of feels out of place that he's just lurking in the shadows.

However, the great factor of this film is Vincent Cassel. He is wicked as the smooth talking and sleek Francois Toulour and commands each scene that he is in, ESPECIALLY one awesome capoeira style scene. Just like he did in 'La Haine', he is cool and effective. Matt Damon is jokes in his part of the insecure Linus Caldwell, desperately trying to prove himself, also showing how versatile he is as an actor.

This means they have to plot new heists, and fast. However, they find their efforts at thievery thwarted at every turn by a mysterious figure known as the Black Fox (Vincent Cassel). Also complicating their efforts is Isabel (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the ex-girlfriend of Rusty (Pitt), who also inconveniently happens to be an Interpol agent.

Some hilarious moments, but at times they get too wacky. Also, I loved the way the movie was shot, the cinematography really added to the whole experience. But, I have one complaint. Some shots are done with a steadicam, the others are camcorder style very much the same way Soderburg shot Traffic. Both ways are fine, but why mix them? Having those two different techniques mixed in didn't go well with me. Anyway, you'll enjoy the cameos, and the one hilarious but over the top scene where they basically make fun of Julia's pregnancy because it was during this shoot that she found out she was pregnant.

There are some funny moments in Ocean's 12 but unfortunately not enough to save the movie from falling flat on its face. The scene where Tess, played by Roberts, has to pose as Julia Roberts to get them into the museum to steal a valuable picture, this scene, although intended to be funny, doesn't quite break it. Even the cameo by Bruce Willis doesn't help. It seems that the actors had fun together making 12, but as I was watching them, I didn't feel a part of their jokes. The camera work, mostly handheld, gets quite annoying after a while, especially the quick panning across the room where the 12 are plotting the heist. Catherine Zeta Jones joins the cast this time around. I don't know whether it was her accent or just her that wasn't right in the picture.

I realize that I've been negative with the review so far. But honestly, that's the only impression I got from the 2 hours or so that I spent in my seat waiting for this movie to be over.

Very disappointing sequel. Hope they don't kill it further with Ocean's 13.

2226101,4,B0007P0XBO,"An action film but without any action. The action on the screen is some type of anti-action. It is there to lure you into not seeing nor looking for details and logical connections. And it works. The main action is in the editing of the film. Very short sequences jumping from one place to another across the world and from one time to another back and fro, even in fake black and white. You are so busy trying to follow the line, to recognize the characters and place them where they are supposed to be that you don't see that nothing happens and what does happen is not shown nor explained. Ah the beautiful coronation egg : what happened to it ? Where was it stolen ? By whom ? The only thing we are about sure is that the egg in Rome was a fake and everyone was fooled, except maybe the gang itself who was, we learn that later, playing the game of the real thief who seemed to have been setting up all that hullabaloo just to recuperate his daughter. Sentimental ending and a big check for the real thief who was burglarised, covered by his insurance and yet wanted his money back with interests. That one was not a casino manager for nothing : stealing people is his job after all, and quite respected at that. But remember Julia Roberts only has the nose of Julia Roberts, certainly not the ears, nor the way she should walk, nor the way she should dress, etc. In other words she is a real fake. Bruce Willis seems to be more like himself, though maybe he should lose a few pounds.

evening to see (for the third time) ""The Incredibles"".

 Yes (you ask) it ""is"" that good!  Unfortunately, our

local theatre dropped this flick from its run starting

today and we were put in the position of selecting

from the Christmas ""leftovers"".  We opted for ""Ocean's

12"".

Let me be abrupt and to the point.  On a scale of 12

oceans (12 being the highest), this one sinks to the

depths of Atlantis...a solid 2.

This ""bomb"" is filled with corny dialogue...a script

so weak and ""slow"", Speedy Gonzalez would get an Oscar

nomination before George Clooney or Brad Pitt...and

the action is so subtle and lame, you wonder if this

wasn't a Fall TV flop that never hit the ""little""

screen.

One of my neighbors walked out of the cinema saying

""what beautiful scenery"".  I said, ""Catherine

Zeta-Jones"" was the real scenery in this one (what a

heart throb).

In comparison to the original (Ocean's 11), which, by

the way, is a remake of the true original starring the

Rat Pack, this one totally sucks.  Even a star-studded

cast couldn't save this loser.  It reminded me of a

cross between liver pate' and frozen hot wings (???).

I will be circulating a petition beginning tomorrow

for  all 12 Oceans to surrender their actor/actress

badges.  Incredibly, the theatre was full (most likely

because all of the other flicks were sold out).

One person actually applauded at the end of the movie.

 At first I thought she enjoyed it.  But in further

review, she was relieved that the film had finally

ended.

If you take the best of ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Ocean's

12"", you come up with ""Spider-Ocean 14"".  It premieres

in 2067 (don't hold your breath).

2226112,2,B0007P0XBO,"I am a huge fan of Steven Soderbergh's 2001 ""Ocean's Eleven"".  It was funny, fast-paced, slick, and a pure joy to watch some of the world's biggest movie stars joke around with each other.  What amazing chemistry George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, etc. had together!  I came into ""Ocean's Twelve"" with high expectations.  It seemed impossible to me that the sequel could be any less wonderful.  As I left the theater, dispirited, I complained to my family, ""How could Soderbergh mess things up so bad?""  All he had to do was provide us with a reasonable script and his stars would do the rest.  Unfortunately, the script was very weak and therefore, the movie simply collapsed.

The film's key structural problem is evident at the outset. After a promising opening, during which Garcia locates George Clooney and Julia Roberts, we then have to watch him confront Brad Pitt. Then Matt Damon ... then Carl Reiner ... then Bernie Mac ... then Elliott Gould ... then Don Cheadle ... and so on and so forth until the entire first reel is finished. At this point you may come to the same startling realization that I did; the movie still hasn't started.

In this overplotted, overpopulated, and overscripted mess of a heist film, I soon found myself inexplicably frustrated with it.  The entertaining banter between the eleven thieves that made the first film so enjoyable is now stale and painfully unoriginal as are the individual identities of each thief.  In ""Ocean's Eleven"", each character was indispensable and played a crucial role in the big heist as opposed to ""Ocean's Twelve"", where all of the characters stand about joking around with each other; and not much else.

The reason for this, I discovered after doing a bit of reading upon returning from the theater, is that the script was originally written by George Nolfi and intended to be a completely different, unrelated film.  Soderbergh simply took the script and tweaked it until he could fit in all of his characters.  THERE is the problem.  The script was not originally developed for this cast of characters or their personalities and therefore never flows properly.  Soderbergh merely altered some low-quality, preexisting material, packed in his stars like sardines and called it a film.

I'm sure many will leave the theater as puzzled as I was as to why they disliked ""Ocean's Twelve"" so greatly.  Well, it's simply because scripts are not interchangeable and cannot be shuffled about from one film to the next.  Soderbergh made this film in order to earn a quick buck and didn't even have enough investment in the film's quality as to take the time to write an actual script!",1103932800,2,2678,4.859030837004405

I anxiously waited for Ocean's Twelve to come out but it was really a big disappointment compared to the first. Taking the example of other sequels, the whole action is moved to Europe, as if Europe is a distant and fantastically foreign land. This lead me to believe this movie is strictly made for Americans. Secondly, the plot is more complicated than in the first movie, but not necessarily in a good way. The heist is not shown in such full detail and the ending just doesn't have the same effect as seeing a remote controlled dummy driving a decoy van (the fact that LeMarc already had the egg and gave it to them didn't actually help the mood much). The music was nice and, despite other films' soundtracks, it's pretty underground. The laser dance song seems to have captured the attention of everybody here (check the soundtrack reviews). This film focuses more on Brad Pitt this time, surely contributing to his general image of a sex symbol, and also on Caterine Zeta-Jones (She's beautiful but I'm sick of seeing her, this is getting old... Get some new women actresses). There are some funny moments in this film, such as the whole Julia Roberts issue with Bruce Willis the playboy, and also some insignificant jokes scattered here and there. In conclusion I'd have to say this movie wasn't what I expected but it's worth seeing if you're a Brad Pitt fan or if you just have to stay true to the cult of seeing every sequel.",1103760000,,1539,4.519713261648746
2226115,3,B0007P0XBO,"""That guy doing Potsie is incredible."" - Danny Ocean has seen happier days in ""Ocean's Twelve""

Feather lightweight sequel to ""Ocean's Eleven"" that is an easy enough timepasser that harkens back to the all-star cast films of the 60's.

Danny Ocean and his team of eleven thieves seem to be doing all right for themselves living off the money they stole from the first film, but, when the casino owner from ""Eleven"" discovers the whereabouts of all the thieves, things turn for the worst.

The casino owner demands back all the money he lost in the casino heist plus interest, or else dirtnaps for everyone.

Since they're pretty reknowned in certain circles in the States, Danny & his eleven co-conspirators decide to take there talents abroad, to Europe and plan to get back the money, by stealing from the rich to save their necks.

The game is afoot when Ocean finds out that an alusive master thief has been setting up Ocean's Eleven all along. Its up to Danny to get four steps ahead of him and stop him.

Steven Soderburgh's direction of ""Ocean's Twelve"" is very retro-sixties, ice blue cool (at times I felt like I was watching a live action version of ""GQ"" magazine).

The cast is great. Clooney and Pitt are hangout cool as the leaders of the gang, but some of the cast gets the shaft. Bernie Mac shows up in the film only to get arrested & spend half the movie in a jail cell. Carl Reiner shows up just enough to get a paycheck. Elliot Gould, it seemed, had less than ten minutes of total filmtime. The Julia Roberts gag went on a little bit too long & isn't very funny. The cameos from popular film stars are pretty good.

2226118,2,B0007P0XBO,"First of all, I have neither seen the previous Ocean's Eleven nor the original Ocean's Eleven. And with that out of the way...

This story takes the 11 thieves across the world to repay for their crimes.  However, all is not so simple for the group as a competitor trained by the best starts to compete with them.  In addition, with the team's safety already on the rocks a detective, played by Catherine Zeta Jones, gets ever closer to catching them.

My opinion of this movie is low for two reasons.  First of all this frankly isn't my type of movie.  What is the difference between thieves and robbers really?  Well, there is apparently enough to make the thieves the good guys (although this is a very thief vs. thief movie.)

Second of all, the movie has a twist, a big one.  Now I am not going to give it away, but pretty much it makes a large chunk of the movie unnecessary and really quite pointless.  Not to mention the twelfth member's lack of involvement.  Really no point in being twelve except maybe it makes the name a little more interesting.

The only saving grace was the limited amount of humor in the character's interactions.  Yet that even failed with an overplayed, boring, and at first way over your head, spoof about Julia Robert's character having a resemblance to, guess what, Julia Roberts!

In summary, I cannot compare it to any previous Ocean movie so I am just going to say the movie was not worth it.  It was not worth the price of the ticket nor my time.  If you like crime movies then that will help, but the humor is lacking and the crimes aren't even interesting.  Well star power is not everything, and neither is this movie.",1103500800,,1662,4.46843853820598
2226119,1,B0007P0XBO,"How could a movie with such great names as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Julia Roberts have failed so miserably?  That's what I asked myself as I watched those A-list stars not pulling this potentially great movie together.  I went to the theatres to see a terrific heist movie, such as Ocean's Eleven, but, unfortunately, this movie followed the almost inevitable gloomy path of sequels.

Before I start degrading this movie, I will admit that the scenes of dialogue between Pitt and Damon worked very well.  Also, this movie did have some opportunities to get back on its feet and really be good, but all of them flopped.  One such instance is when the crooks were going over a model of the building that they were going to rob.  I was really looking forward to see their plan in action, but they ended up going to jail, again. (surprise!)

Now, onto Ocean's Twelve's long list of failures.  First and most importantly of all, Ocean's gang didn't steal anything (until the last five minutes)!  They came close in the beginning of the movie when they tried to steal the first stock certificate ever issued, but Nightfox, the rival thief in the movie, beats them to it.  The rest of the movie was spent weaving in and out of needless and pointless plot extensions with no great caper like the Bellagio heist in Ocean's Eleven.  Overall, the movie just dragged on and on.  In fact, a couple got up and left in the middle of the movie.

In the beginning, Saul (the older man) left the group, which put them down to ten members.  Maybe I just missed the point of the title, but wasn't there supposed to be twelve members of Ocean's crew?  I guess you could count Julia Roberts as a new member, but her absence throughout the middle of the movie made it very unclear that this was her new role.  Another terrible part was when they attempted to throw in some humor by letting Julia Roberts act as the real Julia Roberts in the movie.

Lastly, this movie seemed to focus on the big four actors-Clooney, Pitt, Damon, and Zeta-Jones.  The movie threw the others on and off the screen, hoping that the audience would remember them.

So, if you like Ocean's Eleven, do yourself a favor and keep that opinion- don't see Twelve.  I guarantee you that Ocean's Thirteen won't be getting my money.",1103500800,,2318,4.593673965936739
2226120,4,B0007P0XBO,"Ocean's 12 starts where Ocean's 11 leaves off, 3 years earlier.  Brad Pitt introduces us to the new character, Isabel (Catherine Zeta Jones), who just happens to be federal agent with a great lead on the heist pulled by the 11.  Pitt's character, Rusty, flees the scene and we fast forward to the present.

We now catch up with the various members and current situations.  Danny (George Clooney) and Tess (Julia Roberts) are now married and doing well.  That is, until Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) tracks them down.  From here, he confronts every person that was involved in the heist and tells them he wants all of it back including interest over three years.  So, the gang has to come up with a plan.  Since they are too hot to work in the states, they head overseas to Amsterdam.

Here, they take a small job just to get started and learn that Benedict had help from another thief known as the Night Fox (Vincent Cassell).  Danny and the Night Fox meet and make a bet as to who can steal an egg first.  That will prove who the better thief is. Thus, the scheme begins.

Like Ocean'11, the movie takes us on a ride that keeps the audience guessing what is going to happen next, as well as racking the brain to try to pick up clues and hints along the way.  Steven Soderbergh does another fantastic job directing the great looking cast.

Matt Damon's character, Linus, gets to use his wits a little bit more in this film.  Yet, he still gets a little mixed up.  This just continues the training that he received from Danny and Rusty in the first film.  The film also includes a few cameos by people like Bruce Willis and...Julia Roberts???

Other members of the crew that gets laughs includes the Chinese ""grease man"" played by Shaobo Qin, Basher (Don Cheadle), and Frank (Bernie Mac).  Like the trailers show, they are all back.  This includes classic comedy actor Elliott Gould, Scott Caan, Casey Afleck, Carl Reiner, and Livingston Dell.  Zeta Jones is a great addition to the already stunning looking cast.  We later learn that she plays a crucial part in the film, even if she may not know it.

Soderbergh knew on the git-go that O12 was not going to be ""The Italian Job"" much less ""Rififi,"" so he should have allowed it to be: fun, spare, witty and less that one hour and forty minutes. But at two hours it just drags.

All the Dudes (Pitt, Clooney, Damon, Cheadle, Mac, etc.) seem to be having a great time joking each other, making fun of Catherine Zeta Jones and eating and drinking the finest that Europe has to offer.

2226133,2,B0007P0XBO,"Buckle up, kids, it's gonna be a long one.

It's important to say that this movie set the world record for how many times I've rolled my eyes at a single viewing of a movie.

Okay, yes, let's be honest. 95% of the people going to see this movie aren't looking for a character-driven, deep and rich plot, that showcases enormous landscapes of human emotion. They're looking for an action movie with attractive mainstream movie stars. Do they get it? Yes. Are there some jokes? Yes. Is it better than the original? Good God no.

You have to believe that most of the actors that signed on did so because it'd make a great vacation to Europe with some old friends, from which they would get royalties from for years to come. Yes, as others have said, it truly is a movie that was clearly much more enjoyable to make than to sit through.

I should say now that, no, I don't generally enjoy mainstream shoot-em-up/heist movies. And, no, I don't get all Coo-Coo-For-Cocoa Puffs at the sight of big name box office drawing movie stars. I don't read tabloids, nor do I care who anyone is dating or married to, or what they like to do on their vacations. So, of course, I'm not hardly the targeted audience for this movie.

However, Ocean's Eleven was truly a fantastic movie. Yes, I mean the remake. It WASN'T just an excuse for a bunch of big-name actors to get together and get paid. It had un-seen depths. The characters were warm and enjoyable. It was incredibly witty, and not in the ""look at these bunch of stars crack real life jokes about being a bunch of stars"" kind of way. It had fantastic humor, a good love story, a good cast, good acting, a convincing plot, suspense, and a magical air about it.

Naturally, Ocean's Twelve is lacking in most of those things. There is humor, but most of it is wink wink (with the exception of most of Matt Damon's humor, which was dead on). The love story is annoying and confusing. The acting was good, of course. But most of the faults of this movie lie on the screenplay. Why convert a potential ""Jon Woo-vehicled"" script into Ocean's Eleven sequel? Why not write something brand new? Yes, it really does seem like the producers were actively trying to sabotage this movie from the beginning.

The actual heist was left a mystery until the end, which it was clear they wanted badly for it to be a clever reveal, but it ended up being a disappointing ending to a disappointing movie. One who thinks the movie couldn't have been made without all of the returning actors, need look no further than the actual heist. Which, without giving anything away, TOOK THREE PEOPLE.
Yes, the movie could've been called ""Ocean's Three"". Not even the ""core"" three, either. It wasn't the brilliantly clever, unsuspected plan like in the first movie. Instead, it was a heist that could've easily been pulled off by a few 12 year olds.

One scene that leaves an incredibly bad taste in mine and others' mouthes is the ""Julia Roberts"" scene. I wouldn't bring this up in fear of revealing what it was, but everyone else reviewing this movie has already revealed it, so I might as well.

I saw on an IMDb board, a point was brought up that I didn't realize. If Tess really did look STRIKINGLY like Julia Roberts, how was it that in the first movie she worked at an art gallery, interacting with people every day? Wouldn't every single person that approached her say ""GASP! IT'S JULIA ROBERTS!"" Simply said, it broke the fourth wall, and it was just incredibly unimaginative. What's to stop Bruce Willis from saying ""GASP! IT'S MATT DAMON! GASP! IT'S CARL REINER!""?

Also, in the first movie, we heard Benedict tell Brad Pitt over the phone that he better ""duck and cover"", because if he ever found out who or where they were, they would be beyond dead. But now, he conveniently finds out where they are, and he says ""Okay, I won't hurt you. I just want my money back."" And the team, which in the first movie would've laughed in his face and made a sleek getaway, now says ""My God, Benedict. PLEASE don't hurt us! We'll do anything you say.""

Just disappointing, that's how to best describe this movie. A movie that should've never been made, and that severly lacked the magic of it's predecessor. Congrats, though, to Soderbergh, Clooney, Pitt, Damon and company. They managed to pull a giant heist right under our noses: Getting us to pay to see this movie.

It is merely a handful of gorgeous superstars with sharp tongues traveling aimlessly in a plot vacuum.  It appears that the whole experience is going to hinge on the film makers revealing the jaw dropping twist that will tie the whole mess together in a way that will make sense and make the whole convoluted wait worth it.  It's been 12 hours and I'm still waiting for it to make sense.",1103068800,,1077,4.666666666666667
2226139,4,B0007P0XBO,"This movie is a bull's-eye at the heart of its target audience. Be serious with yourself: you aren't going to see this for anything other than escaping regular life and the holiday hassle. This is mainstream Hollywood entertainment, not an indepent, experimental film. Do you like George Cloony? Think Brad Pitt is cool? Enjoy caper movies in exotic locations? Then this is your movie!

This struck me as similar to the recent remake of ""The Italian Job"" or even the first ""Mission Impossible"" in that the plot is complicated and convoluted, but where those were trying to be fairly serious thriller/dramas, Ocean's 12 is all about coolness and fun. The crew looks good, they have unlimited ideas and funds and all the right contacts. They never stay in Motel 6's, that's for sure. Yes, the plot is a little confusing but let that go and just watch. It unfolds and circles back and eventually resolves itself, sort of. There may be plot holes, but c'mon, this is entertainment.

There are also some fun film tricks like freeze frames, interesting point of view shots, slow-mo zooms and so on. Catherine Z is great and looks better. The new villain is pretty cool. This will make a ton of dough.

All in all, crime pays and man, is it fun!",1103068800,,1238,4.669724770642202
2226140,4,B0007P0XBO,"If you love ""Ocean's 11"" as much as I do, you're bound to be a bit disappointed by ""Ocean's 12.""  This isn't a BAD movie at all...it's actually quite good.  However, it just isn't as slick as the first one, and it doesn't have the whole ""super-cool heist"" element of the first movie, and that's what made ""Ocean's 11"" so damn good.

The premise of ""Ocean's 12"" is that Terry Benedict (played by Andy Garcia) has received an anonymous tip about the crew that robbed his casino a few years ago.  He personally visits each member of the crew and delivers an ultimatum: repay all the money that was stolen from him, with interest, in two weeks, or he'll kill them.  Everyone is forced to band together again in search of a new scam so they can repay Benedict and save their own skins.

Like the first movie, there are a lot of twists and turns in ""Ocean's 12"" that keep the story moving and the audience entertained.  There's another mastermind feeding Benedict information, and his motives are quite surprising (and comical).  The addition of Catherine Zeta-Jones to the cast is one of the best things about the film: her character works for the government and she is trying to bring down her former flame Rusty (Brad Pitt) and the rest of the gang before they can pull off another job.

There is a bit involving Julia Roberts that is by far the best part of the movie.  I'm not going to spoil it by going into detail, but you'll be laughing hysterically when you see it.  (It was kind of a predictable twist, since they started hinting at it right at the start of the film, but it's still really funny.)  Also, there are a lot of celebrity cameos in this movie, so keep your eyes open: you'll be very surprised when you see who pops up on screen!

Overall, this is a good movie: funny, smart, and very entertaining.  I think my expectations were too high because I enjoyed the first movie so much, and there was no way ""Ocean's 12"" could possibly have lived up to my standards.  It really is good, though, and it's one of the few sequels that's actually worth seeing.",1102982400,5,2065,4.440318302387268
2226141,1,B0007P0XBO,"I guess I'll give out the minority report here and say it outright this is rather a disappointing movie with a script that defied the intelligence of the movie audience. Unlike the first movie which I thought was a masterpiece caper movie, where we see the guys go against all odds to do their thing, in the second movie, we actually see nothing at all. All the major elements of the story was done as a conclusion so all the ""heroes"" can looked smug at the end. Its only at the conclusion of the movie that we understand what went on because only at the conclusion of the film, does it showed up everything about the story. So in essence, why bother watching any of the movie at all and just pay your $7.50 and jumped in at the end.

After you watched the movie, you realized that all the ""dangerous"" and ""intense"" scenes were nothing but red herrings because the caper is done with already. How can anyone buy or rent this movie on DVD again, knowing what they know about the movie??

It was pretty sad that such a great cast was wasted but in reality, they were wasted. Only Julia Roberts had some fun when she had to pretend that she is ""Julia Roberts"" with Bruce Willis making a cameo appearance here. Catherine Zeta-Jones make a pretty decent showing here but as Brad Pitts' love interest, she is reduced to a cardboard prop, pretty but unrealistic character. Poor Bernie Mac - totally meaningless role here.

Having wrote all this, I can only say this much more....save your money!! If you must see it...rental seem to be a good idea...just hit the last chapter and you got the story already!",1102896000,6,1599,4.469178082191781

2226164,2,B0007P0XBO,"Oceans 12 isn't Ocean's 11. Now that may not seem like much, because the first film was really more fluff than substance.  However, the first film was clever, intriguing and fresh! Ocean's Twelve isn't.  It wants to be by giving us just the reverse in its set-up.

Yes, we've got the whole gang back again. However, this time out, there seems to be no real reason for each and every person. The writers have not created a piece specifically for this crew of 11 plus one. (The screenplay, in fact, is cobbled together from a unique screenplay never intended to be used for Ocean's 12, but rather a movie all on its own with far fewer players).

Instead of each person having a unique job to perform, the writers decide to drop all the dead wood into a jail cell for the majority of the time. This provides the remaining actors (sic - the major box office stars: Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, Damon, and Zeta Jones) far more ""face"" time on the screen.

What we get is a love interest for Pitt with Zeta Jones (which is really the reason to see this film - because it clicks and Zeta Jones is dynamite in her scenes). We get a very very convoluted premise for the dynamic of the film...and we get an ending that wants to roll everything up nice and neat, although it has little believability.

The ""French Connection"" in this film is a well known and admired French actor who delivers very well on his star potential. However, to propose that this character, physically lithe as he may be, could ""dance"" his way through multiple random laser beams...well, it's just downright laughable. Then there's the whole ""Mommy comes and save me..."" bit.  I won't elaborate on these fronts because I don't want to give away the movie.

It's not a bad film - it's just not really good as a film of intrigue goes. NOW, that said...it's tons of fun watching these actors have fun with each other and poking fun at each other. It's rare indeed that we should see this many actors of this caliber all in the same film - think about it! - it's like an acting all stars team! They may not be the heavist weight ""high brow"" actors, but these are some of the hottest actors out there.

Go see the film and judge for yourself.  You'll like it for sure, but it's just not as satisfying as the first.",1102896000,7,2268,4.41726618705036
2226165,3,B0007P0XBO,"I really wanted to like OCEAN'S TWELVE. Really, really, really. It was going for that same great, hip vibe as its 2001 predecessor. It had the original cast, and it added in some new, gorgeous movie stars like Catherine Zeta-Jones and French star Vincent Cassel to look at. And, most importantly, it had director Steven Soderbergh at the helm once again.

But, I hate to say it, the movie just doesn't work. The plot is overly complicated nonsense that relies too heavily upon title cards to tell us what day it is. Scenes seem contrived so that every cast member can be featured. George Clooney, the lead in the first film, is basically an afterthought here. Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Andy Garcia appear in glorified cameo roles, for I think even Elliott Gould gets more screen-time.

The star who carries the majority of the narrative this time is Brad Pitt, and, boy, does he look fantastic. His clothes are great, and he's charming and is still reaping the benefits from that TROY fitness routine. I mean, since OCEAN'S TWELVE works best as an opportunity to ogle pretty movie stars, it satisfies that most often when Brad Pitt is onscreen.

But it's not as funny as the first one. The caper's not as interesting as the first one. Too many jokes fall flat, and there are way too many in-jokes, only one of which is kinda funny. The direction is stylized and slick, but it feels more like Soderbergh is showing off than presenting a coherent narrative.

The actors do look like they're having a ton of fun running around Europe together, making this movie. But it's not nearly as fun to watch.",1102896000,7,1598,4.636042402826855

2226167,4,B0007P0XBO,"After grossing nearly one-hundred and eighty-five million dollars domestically and well over four-hundred and fifty million dollars world-wide, Warner Brother executives were eager to jump on the bandwagon while the property was still hot and pump out a sequel as quickly, and cheaply, as possible. Steven Soderbergh insisted that the production budget be kept around the same as that of the original film - eight-five million dollars respectively - and asked all his actors, specifically George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts, to take significant pay cuts from their usual twenty-million dollar-per-picture salary. And with the WB studio in a tight market race, currently tied for second place with The Walt Disney Company, they need a hit more then ever, especially if they want to come close to recovering profits lost on the multi-million dollar disaster, Alexander. Perhaps the executives of the studio could learn a thing or two from these con-artists.

The story picks up some time after the original film ended and takes audiences across such glamorous European locations as Amsterdam, Paris and Rome in another crime-capping adventure. It has been three years since Danny Ocean and the rest of the gang of thieves and con artists broke into the ""impenetrable"" vault of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas casino and ripped a cool one-hundred and sixty million dollars right under his nose. After splitting the money amongst the eleven members of the Ocean's team, each went their separate ways, with the exception for Danny and Tess of course, and attempted to lie low and live an easy going life with their newly acquired fortune. Unfortunately for them, a fellow con-artist with a grudge against the group breaks Rule Number One by ratting them out to Terry Benedict, thus causing the ruthless casino owner to pay a visit to each and every one of the team members demanding a return of his one-hundred and ninety-eight million dollars - that's the amount of money they stole plus interest over three years - within two weeks. Considering they are too hot to find suitable work in the United States after their last stunt, they travel to Europe to steal an antique item only to run into complications with their criminal rival, ""The Night Fox"", who just happened to be the man who broke Rule Number One. On top of that, the gang has to deal with Isabel Lahiri, an intrepid female Europol agent with extensive links with Rusty Ryan, who is vividly determined to catch them in the act. When it comes to the story treatment for Ocean's Twelve, one must learn not to take these sorts of genres, specifically the caper-comedy, seriously. They are for mere entertainment purposes only and not to be destined, or taken as such, for Oscar-caliber quality or serious thought. On another note, the script is not as original as it may seem. In fact, it was originally designed as John Woo action-flick vehicle but when it came to developing the highly-anticipated sequel to Ocean's Eleven, Warner Brothers decided to rewrite the script to specifically fit with each of the characters of the series. Though some may feel cheated by this piece of trivia, this turns out ten times better then anything John Woo could have slapped together, so look on the bright side of things here.

The complication Ocean's Twelve faces, the exact same predicament the original feature ran into three years ago, is that with so many cast members, specifically ones with marquee names, increases the likelihood of each person receiving limited screen time which inevitably causes complaints of certain characters being underused. Quite surprisingly, the whole Brad Pitt/Catherine Zeta-Jones romance angle worked amazingly well and added yet another intriguing twist to the already complicated storyline. Unfortunately, what does not work out quite as well as it should have was the ""family"" element to Catherine Zeta-Jones' Isabel Lahiri, if it can be properly described as such. There is hardly any mention of her family other then in limited moments of the film and the scene near the end where she reunites with her father seemed senselessly tacked onto the end without a second thought as to what it should have meant but was not. Perhaps it is due to all these separate story elements - the romance between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones and the wager with ""The Night Fox"" - that George Clooney's Danny Ocean seems quite left out of the picture compared to the last go-around where it was completely and entirely his film. Not that this was a significant problem but this is just yet another demonstration of the sometimes unequal shifting of story involvement amongst the numerous characters of the film series. Without giving too much information away, let us simply say that the way Tess is used in order to help the Ocean's gang pilfer a specific item from an Italian art museum was hilarious. Sure, it does wear a little thin as more time is spent on but, in the end, it works invariably. The only one that can truly be said as being underused in this picture is Andy Garcia reprising his role as the menacing Terry Benedict, the victim of Ocean's Eleven's casino heist from the first film. His appearance in the film, in the beginning and near the end, is really nothing more then a mere cameo, possibly to fulfill the contractual obligation he signed to appear in the sequel with the rest of the cast. This, on the other hand, can not be said of Matt Damon's Linus Caldwell who seems to have had a significant increase in the amount of screen time from the last film, playing a more central role in the story, specifically near the end.

Overall, Ocean's Twelve, in spite of its failure to surpass the magnificence of the original which essentially set the precedent for all modern crime capers to follow, does indeed match it based on pure entertainment value and would certainly be a feature Frank Sinatra and the rest of the crooning Rat Pack would be proud of. All in all, the film itself has very few problems to raise complaint about - A drawback that was apparent with Ocean's Eleven as well was that the first thirty minutes of the picture start off quite laboriously and nothing exactly interesting happens or no real action occurs. Granted, this is to set up the situation and the characters but considering this is a sequel and most audience members are aware of the original film, this should not have taken as long as it did. And was it absolutely necessary to bring back every single member of the original Ocean's Eleven cast for this film? Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner barely appear at all - you could count on both hands, possibly only one, the number of lines each one of them has in this feature - and should have been written out entirely based on what they contribute - nothing. Middling complaints aside, Steven Soderbergh's skillful editing, mixing and cinematography style works wonders, except for the occasional still-picture shots, near the beginning and the end of the film, but are not so off-putting as to be entirely noticeable or discomforting. Though not holding quite the level of prestige as some notable sequels that have managed to surpass the expectations set upon by the first film might have, the series still able to maintain its suave composure, intricate white, and stylized flare to make more then worthwhile viewing over the holiday season this year.",1102723200,,7401,4.890923566878981

2226171,4,B0007P0XBO,"I was drawn to ""Oceans Eleven"" by my love of Las Vegas, only with Vegas now too hot for Daniel Ocean to do a sequel, I had to settle for subsidiary motivation on being something of a minor George Clooney fan.  As the advance material on TV says, the victim Mr. Benedict wants back his 0.16 billion with interest, giving the gang 2 weeks to get it before he takes it out of their hides (apparently, when you're that rich, murder for hire is but a trivial expense account item).  Clooney and his crew are forced to become expatriates to do any real stealing, so they're off to Amsterdam and a romp over the European Union in general.  They soon discover, however, that Europe is not big enough for TWO such bella donnas, so Ocean begins his competition and cooperation with ""Night Fox"", revered by the European authorities as as much of a master in robbery as Rembrandt is to painting, on account of his mentoring and his own accomplishments.  I'm thinking that his presence is what makes the Eleven into Twelve.  The plot moves to Italy, with the focus being on the Romanoffs' Coronation Faberg egg, a target that would give N.F. the compassion to pay off Ocean et al.'s debts from his endless bank accounts, should they get it.  But after this, the plot begins to splinter into many shattered parts, and I couldn't keep up with it.  Benedict has some sort of hand in the whole thing, in combination with Night Fox, and before long, you feel you're in the middle of something like Dickens' ""Great Expectations"".  The camera work and the action are quite good though, on what looks like an anamorphic 2.35:1 presentation, and just letting the scenes flow over you is not a bad experience.  The compulsion towards plot and ultimate meaning were lacking, however, so I'm handing it 4.1 stars.",1102636800,3,1788,4.615141955835962
