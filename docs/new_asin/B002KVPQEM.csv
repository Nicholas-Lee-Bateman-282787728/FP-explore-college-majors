3945093,2,B002KVPQEM,"The Ancient Gogoo Girl is played by Yazawa Erika, whose size J-cup breasts are well displayed by her bikini-like costume.  The stories are silly - in fact at the beginning one of the Japanese titles identifies this as ""Junk Drama"" - and the main purpose seems to be showing Yazawa-san's breasts jiggle, which they do impressively.  It's tongue-in-cheek all the way, and provides good laughs.  Unfortunately, as is so often the case with Chinese releases of Japanese dramas, the subtitles are unintelligible.  First, the Japanese are given as Chinese names, for example ""Makoto"" becomes ""Cheng"" and ""Dogu-chan"" becomes ""Little Soil"".",1266796800,3,632,5.29
3945094,3,B002KVPQEM,"This Japanese TV series, very much MTV-style with its fast edits, revolves around a young man with aspirations to become the biggest operator of cabaret clubs in Tokyo.  He encounters all sorts of obstacles but, with the help of his friends, he overcomes them.

The series itself is interesting and the characters are attractive.  But this seems to be the Readers Digest version of a longer series and, therefore, suffers from some unexplained jumps in the story on the second disc.  Likewise, the translation changes at the same time from adequate to incomprehensible.  And the names become translated, inexplicably, into Chinese rather than the Japanese names used all through the first disc.

The boy on the cover is, however, very pretty.",1264032000,,742,5.090909090909091

If you a fan of live action girls running around in a bikini type outfit then this one is for you. It come in a box with 2 dvd's It does have Very poor English subtitles (that half the time don't make sense) but who's watching it for that!! With a plastic sword in hand & a little robot partner who identify all the monsters who they are & where they come from. She fights all Monster & demons to save the world.  Worth a pick up if you can find it I recommend starting off with season 1 & if you like it get season II

3945107,1,B002KVPQEM,"I love this series and I was so excited when I found it here on amazon but . . . this is something that should be sold on ebay NOT on amazon.  It is a cheap chinese made DVD.  The first few episodes were stolen from a fansub group!! They didn't even try to hide the fact that they stole it!  The episodes still had the subbing groups name and their disclaimer ""This is a free fansub and is not for sale!""  (Although the subbing group that they stole the subs from is AWESOME!)  The last few episodes in the series the distributor tried to translate and sub the episodes but it was an epic fail, I don't think their subbers really knew how understand, much less sub a drama series in English.  If they were going to steal some episodes, they should've just stole them all.  At least then all the subtitles would've been awesome.  If the DVD is a fake rip off then say that in the description!  Selling fake DVDs is a crime and this series IS licensed in the US.  Do not waste your money on this, watch it for free online with awesome subs.

I ended up fast-forwarding through to the end just to see what happened to the characters, but couldn't understand any of the nuances of the department store merger or the familial relationships between the main characters.  Even 'English to English' translation was wrong! Hard to screw that up, but it was managed.",1321228800,,462,5.052631578947368

3945110,1,B002KVPQEM,"This J-Drama has been close to my heart for years. I was so glad what I finally got to own it. It wasn't until after it arrived that I realized it was pirated. It's a good work, the cover is solid and set up pretty well, but no copyright info gave it right away. I gave it a shot anyway, several months after the fact, and now I'm editing this review to include that part.

The subtitles are a joke. If I hadn't seen the show before, I would have no idea what they were doing. It's ridiculous. Spelling errors, grammar issues, and just... awful. It ruined my absolutely favorite J-Drama, and

In the first fifteen minutes before I turned it off all these gems showed up:
""I accuse you of sexualized harrassment!""
""Let me be here... better die!""
""Not bad voice... how taste?""
And my favorite: ""Also mean... once the distore Matropolys Tokyo power system... Acity... the photo. Concave edition. Always take photo for female body.""

And I don't mean once in awhile. These sorts of issues are in every single translated sentence. Nothing is right. Do not buy this product. As a fan of the show, I'm telling you; it's not worth it. The happiness you feel holding it in your hands will be completely DESTROYED when you press play.",1318636800,2,1224,4.504504504504505

the finale has a translation problem, it seems whoever did the translation was NOT translating japanese > english, but seemed to be translating japanese > chinese > english, so that many things were phrased oddly and i found myself reading the subtitles twice as hard.

this doesn't get a 5* because of the last episode's translation issue.",1313625600,,688,4.973913043478261
3945143,4,B002KVPQEM,"(review by user's son... who was the actual customer)

First, I have to say, reviews should NOT be based on trailers! (What was the other user thinking?) Seriously, how is that a fair assessment of a movie or TV show?

After receiving this DVD set and having watched ALL 12 episodes I have to say, I loved it! But you have to be a fan of over-the-top Japanese TV/cinema otherwise your reaction will simply be... ""what?""

A lot of people online are confusing this for a children's show. That is our (American) culture at work... if we see animation or goofy costumes and foam-rubber monsters we assume ""kid's show."" Definitely not true in this case. If this were and American TV show, it would probably be rated TV-14.

The only reason THIS DVD set doesn't get 5 stars is because while the English subtitles on episodes 1-5 were excellent, the subtitles on episodes 6-12 were apparently Japanese translated into Chinese then translated into English. They are horrible and nonsensical. I had to search online for fan-subtitles. Other than that, it's a good buy. To be honest, you could watch this show without the subtitles and still understand what is going on.

Well... that is if Koi fish-people who employ mind-control on their worshipers and are stopped by a cute Japanese schoolgirl in a battle-bikini is easily understandable for you. ^_^",1311465600,2,1343,4.821739130434783

It really is a great show and I am happy none the less that I bout it, but I sugest watching it online first and then decied for yourself wether its worth buying and dealing with the subtitles.",1310688000,,577,4.476190476190476
3945145,4,B002KVPQEM,"4 stars for the story, the characters, and the actors.  My one complaint would be the poor translation of the last episode. I knew this in advance because other reviewers commented on it as well, so after experiencing it myself, I have to say I agree ---it was pretty bad---CHI CHI in Japanese can mean ""father"" or ""breast"".  The story line was about treating breast cancer, but the translator used ""father"" for the whole episode.  It was kind of hilarious actually. Fortunately, I speak Japanese, so I was explaining it to my friends while we watched.",1309910400,,552,4.729166666666667

internet connection this time.  The picture quality is great and
watched some episodes with a friend of mine who speaks and reads
Japanese well.

While I wasn`t paying attention to subtitles, she started asking me
if I noticed some weird translations.  There are a couple of (sometimes more) mistranslations in each episode, but my jaw literally dropped when I started
watching the last one.  Obviously it must have been translated
from Chinese into Japanese by someone who had no idea what he/she was doing.

We had to turn off subtitles and I explained to her whenever she had
a hard time to understand.

seen such horrible translations on DVDs on the market in my entire life.",1304208000,,818,4.75886524822695

They would have been better off to use the Menu form McDonalds to translate it. It is a shame, because the story is a great story.

However from episode 5 onwards, they are atrocious. It seems these are translations of the Chinese subtitles. Names are totally different (for example ""Haruna"" becomes ""Chunnai""). Grammar and spelling mistakes are everywhere. When a close-up of a document is shown, there is no translation.

I have had to turn off the subs and try to follow the story with what little Japanese I know. There are even times where no subs are in place when people are talking.
The series is basically about a high school boy and how his samurai ancestor comes to him when he K.O.'ed and helps him out. It makes for a interesting story",1294272000,2,472,4.197802197802198

It was at first amusing but became quite annoying after a while. I am sure Japanese speakers will enjoy this drama series (sub-titles off). The picture quality of the last few episodes on Disc 2 is also very bad. The actors, scenery, props, special effects etc, were all excellent and authentic. The dvd keep-case is an improvement from the normal plastic one, This dvd series probably deserves five stars but those terrible sub-titles spoilt everything, I should ask for a refund!!!",1293494400,5,746,4.746153846153846
3945166,4,B002KVPQEM,"I bought this pretty blind on a whim.  I actually thought it was a movie and was surprised to find that it was a tv show aimed at teens.

So far I've only watched the first episode but it reminds me of the 80s kids shows I watched that were shot on video.  The whole thing seems tied to a Japanese version of ""Seventeen"" fashion magazine.  At the end of the episode, we get to find out how to dress like the stars.

English subtitles are hit and miss but I was able to get the gist of everything.  Menus are not translated though so there's a bit of guesswork.

Played fine on my Region one (US) PS3.

Packaging is very odd.  It feels more expensive than a normal dual dvd box but somehow less secure.  Hard to describe.",1292630400,,720,4.115107913669065
3945167,3,B002KVPQEM,"The show itself probably isn't bad, but with horrible subtitles, most of the meaning behind the movie is lost.  Not only is the context of the movie made confusing through the translation, but the third person references are absolutely horrible.  Almost everyone is referred to as ""he"" and ""him"" even when they're talking about a female or to each other.  Most of the time I have no idea who they're talking about unless they mention names.  I'm going to have to watch this movie again later with the Chinese subtitles to see if that's any better, but I'm not just not motivated right now.  I had trouble getting into the movie since I had so much trouble deciphering what they're really saying.  I know some sayings and jokes will be lost through translation, but this show's subtitles are just ridiculous.",1289779200,,807,4.728571428571429

Then we got started on disc 4 and the first episode would not play...so we skipped it. I had previously seen that particular episode on TV while in Hawaii.  But then, when we got to the last disc and arguably most climactic one, the English dubbing was absolutely terrible.  It seemed to be Chinese-English dubbing.  The characters were being called by Chinese names and the grammar was what you'd expect from someone whose first language is not English.  It was incoherent, shes were referred to as hes.  Ugh.  I wish I would have known that there was trouble with the dubbing before I bought it.

3945176,5,B002KVPQEM,"A new TV series, this is a great deal like Dr. Quinn medicine woman. A brain surgeon finds himself transported back into the past and must deal with cultural superstitions and folk medicine in his quest to heal. It's absolutely amazing how many times he finds himself in situations where he needs to open up someone's brain.
The doctor is also suffering from hero martyr complex, having accidentally permanently injured his fiance in a surgery meant to save her life. In the present he can't operate any more, but in the past he is forced to cope and thrive as a doctor once again. Fate and/or perhaps the spirit of his near dead GF have forced him into a situation where he needs to get his life back. Why he is there is never explained, but he meets his Fiance's ancestor and struggles to not have an affair with her and spends all his time fretting he is somehow harming her future with his meddling.
This is an extremely engaging show. The one and only complaint I have is the production company COMPLETELY dropped the ball on the English translations. All of the episodes are beautifully fan subbed except for the last episode. The free fan sub obviously wasn't ready, so the production company who can't speak a word of English translated the dialog through google or something. The translation on the last episode is laughable. It is COMPLETE gibberish. Not one word of understandable dialog. It's so bad it should win an award. All the names are changed and you would get more information about the episode by picking up any book off your coffee table and reading it along as you watched. This is BAD, since the final episode is so marvelous and moving. Luckily, you can find the fan subbed last episode on [...]

Buy the DVD, and watch the final episode on the internet first so you know what is happening. It's worth the aggravation, it's a wonderful show!",1278028800,3,1866,4.603603603603603

While the video quality is decent, and the show itself is good, the english subtitles are laughable at best and perplexing at worst. It seems like they were translated from the chinese translation, rather than the japanese itself, and even the names are in chinese. Although the first two episodes were actually properly translated, I'm not sure why this happened with the rest. I bought two other drama DVDs, and it seems the quality of the subtitles are completely random, even between episodes.

3945179,3,B002KVPQEM,"Minakata Jin is a compassionate, yet arrogant brain surgeon who performs surgery on his girlfriend's brain tumor, and she is left in a vegetative state.  He then loses confidence in his surgical skills and trades, with other doctors, operations for his patients with graveyard emergency room duties. One night, a man with severe head trauma is admitted, and Jin must do the brain surgery since no other surgeon is on duty that night.  He finds an embryo grwoing inside the patient's brain. Later, the patient tries to escape with the fetus (which had been placed in a specimen bottle in the lab). Jin chases him, falls, and when he wakes up, he is in 1860's Japan.

This is an 11 episode drama, where a 21st century physician is placed in a 19th century environment.  He needs to follow the following questions: why was he placed there? how much history can he alter with his actions? how proactive should he be when dealing with his patients? Giving away how he responds to these questions would be a spoiler, so I won't answer these questions.

During the course of these episodes, he encounters famous people from Japanese history, and Takao Osawa, who plays Jin, does a good job of being in awe when he encounters people or events he has read about in history books. It is also interesting to see how he deals with 19th century afflictions without 21st century tools.

Time travel is always a difficult one to get right, and this one doesn't quite get all questions the standard time travel plots need to answer, like altered history.  The last episode also left a few other things unanswered, so I don't know if they were thinking of doing a season two for this program.  If I knew there was or is going to be a season two, I would give it four stars instead of three. The last item worth mentioning is the sub-titling.  I was happy with it until the very last episode, when I encountered the same problem as wit the Rookies dvd. The names of the characters all changed, and the translations were way way off at times. But they weren't so off that I couldn't get the jist of what was happening. But the improper translations could have affected my understanding, thus missing in on some questions I might have had at the conclusion.

I had seen another version to compare it with and its like watching a different story line, when you can understand some phrases but lots of it just does not make any sense....Very sad, love the show and don't know how else to watch it with English captions. Wasted a lot of money....",1408924800,,373,4.5

8372255,5,B002KVPQEM,"OK, this ain't no Kurasawa epic or even a Takashi Miike shocker... it is what it is.....a very cute and sexy girl wielding a sword against some very bizarre Japanese monsters. It is what it is.... and it is a hoot! It is funny, bad, silly and hard to resist since our Dogoo Girl is such a delight to look at!

Yes, it may dumb down the ol' brain a tad, but it is well worth it if you love beautiful Japanese women.",1376697600,,414,3.9879518072289155
