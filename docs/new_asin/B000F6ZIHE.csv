2553555,5,B000F6ZIHE,"I am a 60 year old with some osteo-arthritis and not an elite athlete. I have done aerobic exercise for about 20 years. I enjoy the intensity level and duration of this workout--I do only 1 segment on busy days and full workout every other day. It is challenging, but attainable; the steps aren't easy, but they aren't too difficult and I'm NOT a dancer! My only complaint is that you need a good size area to do the workout which I don't always have available to me.",1258934400,3,467,4.318181818181818
2553556,4,B000F6ZIHE,"Timesaver is my favorite Kathy video.  In fact, I'm finally buying it on DVD because I wore it out on tape.  I am not coordinated in the least, and I was able to follow the steps quite easily.  Kathy builds the sequences and thus you do v steps, then boxes, then v steps and boxes, then v steps, boxes and Charlestons...through the whole video, and then you do the complete sequence twice.  She and the other people on the video are high energy, for sure, but hey, that's Kathy.  The yelling on this is not nearly as bad as on Timesaver Lift Weights To Lose Weight.  There's actually 2 workouts on this video.  The first one, my favorite, is the low impact sequence routine.  The second gives you the option to do high impact or low impact, and unlike lots of videos that offer a high/low sequence, you can actually *see the low impact person throughout.  It's only about 20 minutes per workout, you can do one or combine them for a longer day if you need to.  The end offers a nice cooldown stretch routine.  I first did this workout while getting in shape for my wedding 7 years ago, and boy did it work, I lost a ton of weight and got toned just doing workout one 5 days a week.  I still come back to it because it's fast, and it works.  Plus, you can squeeze it into your day quite easily.  Kathy does transition fast, but she does call out the move, and after doing the building sequence a few times it's a no brainer.  Love.  I found this way easier to do step wise than, say, my Firm videos, which I had to watch more than once just to familiarize myself with the steps, and even after doing the workout 4 or 5 times I still had trouble.  I'm the type of person who falls over cracks in the sidewalk, so for me to say this is easy to follow?  Believe me, it is.",1247702400,18,1768,4.165191740412979
2553557,1,B000F6ZIHE,"This DVD was disappointing and hard to follow. If you're not the most coordinated and have a hard time changing movements suddenly, this one is not for you. This is definitely my least favorite of all my fitness DVDs and my least favorite of Kathy's.",1210204800,2,250,4.5777777777777775
2553558,3,B000F6ZIHE,"I have owned so many Kathy Smith videos over the years. I LOVE her functionally fit peak fat burning work out and the cardio kick, but do get bored with these.  I checked this one out from a local library before I spent the money and am glad that I did.  I'm not the most coordinated person and this work out just confused me.  I felt out of step for most of it.  The moves don't seem to flow intuitively like I want in an aerobic workout. I did the full 40 minutes as I didn't feel 20 minutes was enough.  The second work out was better than the 1st, but still not one of her better work outs.",1201046400,6,594,3.957983193277311
2553559,5,B000F6ZIHE,"kathy Smith has been around for years , but she looks amazing. she is a great instructor ,is very clear in directions, creates challenging and effective routines. This DVD has 3 sections 2 20 minute workouts plus a wonderful say goodbye to stress stretch program. It runs 60 minutes so you can do one, two or three depending on time. She has helped me change my workout habits with her great calorie burning workouts!",1200441600,4,417,4.648648648648648
2553560,3,B000F6ZIHE,"The Kathy Smith Timesaver- Cardio Fat Burner is a DVD with 2 20 minute cardio segments that you can use indivisually or all together. There is also a 7 minute stretch you can do at the end if you choose.

The first workout is set at a moderate pace it starts off as one small rountine that you add on to and by the end of the 20 minutes you have established a good sized rountine. The only problem is that the people exercising in the backround constantly cheer in a way that annoys rather than motivates. Also Kathy Smith will let one of the backround exercisers take over for a couple of minutes. The backround people are constantly changing positions so everyone can be up front and it creates confusion and fustration.

The second workout has several different moderatly paced rountines. At the end of each rountine you will have a choice to keep at the pace you're at or take it to a higher intensity for 30 seconds- 1 minute. The ""cheering"" had died down a bit and it is less annoying but every once in a while the camera will show a view of someone doing the workout and they will speed it up so that the picture is a blur making it a pain since sometimes they are in the middle of showing you a new move. I like this workout better but it is very exhausting.

Overall I thought that this DVD was a good workout despite the few things I've mentioned above and I would recommend it unless you are someone who gets aggrivated very easily in that case I'd suggest something else.",1157587200,13,1483,4.308243727598566
2553561,3,B000F6ZIHE,"This video is broken into 2, 20 minute cardio workouts, each can be do alone or when time allows, back to back for a longer workout.  The exercises are a bit more playful than a standard cardio routine but still keep you working hard.  But be prepared...it will also give your mind a challenge while you struggle not to laugh at how cheesy it is.

First of all, at best the music is reminiscent of something SNL would use for creating a bad clubbing' scene and Kathy's rather large group of back up exercisers are all wearing head sets (no really).  With very unnatural perma-grins plastered on their faces, Kathy's entourage add their own track of overly enthusiastic whoops, hoots and oh yeahs ad nauseam.  Is there such thing as a Stepford aerobiciser?

Although the video seems to offer effective and challenging routines, the informal, dance party USA, approach ultimately overshadows Kathy's focus of providing an adequate amount of instruction for my taste.  This was disappointing since some of her other videos provide such thoughtful guidance.  Overall, you can get a good workout, but her approach seems a bit unprofessional.",1155254400,12,1136,4.942105263157894
2553562,2,B000F6ZIHE,"This video is rated as a Beginner/Intermediate cardio workout.  It includes an approximate 20 minute ""Beginner"" cardio session and a ""bonus"" second 20 minute cardio session to be done with the first session to really burn the calories.

As a beginner, I found the so-called ""beginner"" session to be very hard to keep up with.  I have done aerobics before and am not completely out of shape and I could hardly keep up!  She literally shows you the move once and then kicks into high gear.  It was ridiculously fast without enough explanation of the moves. I was very disappointed.

If you're an ""Intermediate"" aerobics person this ones probably ok for you, if you're a beginner, save your money.",1155254400,18,694,4.7899159663865545
8118374,4,B000F6ZIHE,"This workout is a great TIMESAVER workout.  2 - 20min. sections.  Low impact, good on joints.  Tone up, loose some weight and start feeling strong.  Great to get back into the workout routine with or great if you have busy schedule. Its from the 80's -  so like most workouts from years ago, the video is less quality, and the music is basic.  I turn down the video's music and put my own on.  Love this workout routine.",1511049600,,420,4.3076923076923075
8118375,4,B000F6ZIHE,"Both of the routines in this DVD are OK for me, and I have painful osteoarthritis in both of my knees.  The second routine has options for people who want a more high-impact workout during the cardio bursts.  I wore out my old VHS tape of this and was relieved that DVD copies were still available for purchase.",1484006400,,311,4.344827586206897
8118376,3,B000F6ZIHE,"This dvd was just ok,  I think i needed one a little more advanced.",1456099200,,67,3.7857142857142856
8118377,5,B000F6ZIHE,"This DVD seems super dated - the filmmaking style, the outfits, etc - but I just love it. Kathy can be arrogant in other videos, but in this one she seems more approachable and human. I like that she focuses on explaining the moves rather than cheerleading and screaming at you about your tight buns a la Denise Austin. The DVD is divided into 2 twenty-minute workouts. You can do one or both depending on your time available that day.",1401840000,,435,4.45
8118378,1,B000F6ZIHE,"Unclear instruction, confusing presentation of moves, and a lot of unpleasant ""sound effects"" (squeals etc) by KS and crew.  Could cause confusion and injury.  Some of KS' videos are good, this one is to avoided.",1387411200,2,212,5.0285714285714285
8118379,4,B000F6ZIHE,I had checked this item out at the library and liked it so I ordered a copy for myself.  It is great to have a 20 minute cardio routine for the days when I have limited time to workout.,1364083200,,185,3.7435897435897436
8118380,3,B000F6ZIHE,"This was actually a really great video with a major flaw - the strange camera/picture work.  There is the normal picture of people doing the steps, but then it suddenly switches to this blurry video.  Great for actions in movies, I guess, but not good if you're trying to follow steps.  The first workout became very annoying fast with a million and one different instructors trying to yell out directions.
Otherwise, these workouts are great.  The second workout is especially good since it gives a high impact option.
Just that blurry picture they insert in the video every so often really gave me a headache!",1309305600,3,611,4.79047619047619
8118381,5,B000F6ZIHE,"Kathy Smith may not have the most complex choreography but she does a great workout.  This is one of the best if it's raining outside and you don't have much time.  The music is up-beat, the cueing is good and you do break a bit of a sweat.  Good for frequent and returning exercisers.",1283731200,,285,4.2407407407407405
8118382,3,B000F6ZIHE,"Don't like having to watch the Introduction (5 minutes) every time I play the dvd.  I'm usually short on time, so it is really irritating and a waste of time.  When I try to go to menu, it won't let me.  Other than that, you get a good workout and it is easy to follow.",1278979200,3,269,3.8545454545454545
8118383,2,B000F6ZIHE,"I don't consider myself a beginner in that my fitness level is around the average range, I am a little on the uncoordinated side and I couldn't keep up with this.  Kathy doesn't slowly walk you through the steps and neither are they simple steps, so if you are looking for something for that is for uncoordinated people like myself, this would not be the video for you.",1261785600,7,369,4.426470588235294
