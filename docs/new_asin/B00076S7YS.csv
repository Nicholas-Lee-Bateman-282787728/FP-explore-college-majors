  It is a story where good and evil is portrayed by some convincing actors e.g., the evil Prime Minister and the strong, loving and faithful wife of the Army's Commander in Chief, and where good and bad choices have their consequences. The enfolding of the characters through conflict, romance, jealousy, revenge, filial piety, gallantry, patriotism, justice and honor, deception and manipulation, humor, tears and tenderness, fighting and strateging, and many other human and godly traits are all found in this complex and intriguing story.  The screen director mentally and emotionally gets you involved with the characters and their stories through the end.  The costumes are elegant and the sceneries are appropriate.
  On a lesser note, part of the movie footage lacks clarity and the faces of the characters and/or scenes are shadowed. Some of the actors' roles are neither strong nor convincing, and some of the scenes were a bit too drawn out. Like some of the other Chinese series I have seen, the director takes the time to build and elaborate on the charancters and the story line over 7 1/2 discs, but then drops the story with swift ending.  I was disappointed as it did not give me sufficient time to elevate my tears into joy or at most acceptance of the ending. Nevertheless, I still think this Chinese DVD Series is worthwhile seeing!",1215475200,,1555,4.819548872180451

8045047,3,B00076S7YS,"A young woman was raped. Her brother organizes a group of vigilante students decide to take matter into their own hands by hunting down the murderers in this low-budget 80's film known either as The Graduates Of Malibu High or The Young Warriors. The stars include Ernest Borgnine,Lynda Day George,James Van Patten,Anne Lockhart and Tom Reilly.

While this film had the inclusion of a talented cast like Borgnine and Day George,it was definitely an unrealistic film and in the process becomes a funny film when the group of vigilantes takes matter into their own hands to avenge the harm done to the woman who was raped. In the end,we get to see all of them get killed with the brother committing suicide after realizing negative consequences of his actions after killing the rapists.

This movie basically tried to justify the existence of gangs and violence but regretted it at the end. It a so bad BUT was SO GOOD that considering it to be a low-budget film from the 80's made it worth watching.",1440547200,,998,4.7298850574712645

8045053,5,B00076S7YS,"This drama is good. Although the show starts off slow, it picks up. It is interesting enough to make me watch the whole thing to see how everything will end.

The story is about the Yang family. The dad is the best general. Everyone love and respect the Yang family because the Yang army protects the border from the enemy. And of course, like almost all other drama, there just have to be a evil person in the court who despise and hate the good guys. In this case, the bad guy is the prime minister. He wil be the one who sabtoage the Yang family.

There is also the other country, who wants thier land. The other country is the enemy. The enemy's general is pratically a nice guy. You can not really hate him, well I can't. The enemy Empress and the general respects the Yang Gernal (the dad) and his army. But because they want their land, they will fight against them.

There are seven brothers and one younger sister. The other older three brothers just seem to blend into the background. The younger sister only play a important role in the beginning of the drama. The story mainly focuses on the last four brothers and the dad for the most part. It shows how the four brothers find love and how their relationship with others influence them.

The fourth brother (Peter Ho) has a tragic history. When he was younger, he was lost in battle. The parents never gave up the hope that he is not dead, but alive somewhere. He eventually came back but he holds a grudge against his parents for leaving him behind. So he struggle with his conflicting emotions of hate and love for his family. His lover is a doctor or someone who knows medicine. The rivalry for his love interest is the son of the prime minister (the bad guy from the court). I think they make a very cute couple. ^__^ She understands how he is feeling. She helped him emotionally and phisically; she is the balm to his weary soul. BUT, i hate the ending for this couple. I do not understand why it ended the way it did. It makes no logical sense as to why that would happen to him. Their ending just wants you to smash the director for doing that to them. Seriously. -__- It just left you hanging high and dry. WHY DID THAT HAPPEN????!!! WHY???!!!!! I would understand why that happen if the producer are trying for a second drama as follow up. But somehow i doubt that would happen. T__T  So again WHY must this happen to them??? Haven't the fourth brother suffer enough already??? So if anyone wants to tell me the reason why, please do so.

The fifth brother and the enemy general, they both love the same girl. Sometime I think the girl have some feelings for the enemy general. It seems as if she could love the enemy general more than she could love the fifth brother. But because the general is the enemy, she won't love him back. Although I could be wrong on my assumption. It just seems like that to me. This couple ending was sad but i understood why it happen. And i feel that she kind of deserve it. Poor guy. I can feel his pain and frustration. I feel that she shouldn't have done what she did. He is her husband but he is still a man and a solider first. Sad ending for them. T__T

The sixth brother (Hu Ge) is probably the main hero out of the brothers. In the beginning, he was a playful guy, never too serious. But as the story progress, he changes. He likes to invent things. His love interest is the princess, the neice of the Emperor. The both like to argue with each other. In this love triangle, we have a girl in love with the brother. This girl is the daughter of the prime minister (again the evil dude from the court -__-). So she is the mean girl here. Yep, she is totally evil just like her father. She was the one who brings trouble to the sixth brother and the princess. Their ending is the only happy ending for any of the couple in here. So yeah for them!

The seventh brother (Eddie Pang) has a cute love story. Although I must say, I perfer him with the friend he made in the beginning than the girl he ended up with. His friend girl was a sweet and nice person. She was with the enemy general. She had a sad and lonely life. So when she made friend with the seventh brother, she was very happy. His love interest is the opposite of the firend girl. She is loud but navie and easy to decieve. And he took advantage of her naviety. They definetly have cute and heartmelting moment, espcially when he confess his love to her. ^__^ The time they spent together was short. But they truly love each other. Again another sad ending. Gosh, I cried. It was just oh so heartwrenching. T__T So be warn.

Not the whole drama focuses on romance. I like romance so I write it in the reveiw. This drama has more to it than the romance I wrote. It has battle, fighting scene, and action. So don't miss out on this if you don't like the romances.

There are at least two intense battle that got me on the edge of my seat. And i must warn you that the major battle will rock your world and not in a good way. T__T And i advise that you have a box of tissue because you will cry. I swear there were at lest two epsisodes were I was crying like there is no tomorrow. The tragedy and sad moments just kept on hitting me over the head. One moment, i thought i am done crying, but the next scene, fresh tears came pouring out. T__T I will be shock if no one cry at all. Because it was intense and so freaking sad. And I must say that you will want to throttle the Emperor. I totally blame the Emperor for being so stupid! If the Emperor did not fall to the lies then everything would have turned out well. But because he did, tragedy befall on the Yang army. It was too late. T__T

I must say that the last fighting scene between the sixth brother and the enemy general was a dissapointment. It ended without a bang but it was still touching to see the war end. ^__^

so overall, it is a good drama. Very good. ^__^",1280707200,4,5895,4.216312056737588
8045054,5,B00076S7YS,"THE YOUNG WARRIORS......DVD Series (Dec 2008 release date)

An exciting series emcompassing wonderful long knife martial arts, family values, the deceit for power and the king's throne, romance, and the general respect for family and elders ( or the lack of it for some characters in the series).  The acting is very good, the customs depict the way it was hundreds of years ago.  It is a series that will grip your attention and will get you addicted to keep you longing to continue on to the next episode and then the next and then.....  Speaking of which, when I reached the very last episode,  the story seems to hang in midair, unfinished.  ****  Is there or will there be a part 2 to this series?? *****  If the series is continuing on the air (I don't if it is or not at this time Jan  2010) it will be great, if it is,  it is even better  when it comes out on DVD... and I will wait for it.  If this is the type of action you like, then I highly recommend it.  A note,  it is in only cantonese and mandarin.  English is only in the subtitles.  Still, not much is lost via the subtitles although you will get the best flavor if you can understand the verbal chinese.  LTC DCC",1263772800,7,1182,4.228699551569507
8045055,5,B00076S7YS,"To me, this drama is the best production from China in recent years. It tells the story of the Yang brothers fighting for their country during the Song Dynasty. Costumes are superb and the acting is good. Amy Chan really stands out as the caring and courageous mother. Yang Ye is a charismatic and absolutely patriotic father.
Production is impressive: war scenes are convincing, and there is no over-use of CGI. The story is really moving, and the ending got me to shed tears, which is not usual.
I strongly recommend this excellent series, which allows both to learn about history, all while getting a good share of entertainment.",1238025600,,632,4.807339449541284
