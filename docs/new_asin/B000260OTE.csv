2063294,3,B000260OTE,Raunchy. Just what I was looking for. Same old WIP story line. Awful acting and unbelievable plot. Lots of T/A&P shots. The ending is also bit unusual but it works.,1469059200,3,164,4.5

2063296,4,B000260OTE,"First, I have not seen this version. I saw the VHS version years ago. pretty much what you would expect in women in prison movie. I would say that it fell somewhere between a Hard ""R"" and Hard Core. Didn't quite get to the hard core aspect, but that is pretty much the way all of his movies are. He had once said that he saw no point in showing the actual sex, to be erotic and sexy.

Anyway, the story isn't much. Girl is abused by father, reaches her limit and kills father. Goes to court and is convicted and sent to a womans prison. The place is brutal, and being the new girl in town, she is singled out for all sorts of stuff. Lina Romay, plays the Lady Warden, with her own sadistic issues, and loves to wear a monocle. This movie could have been just another tedious exercise, but was watchable. As I said, I saw it years ago on VHS and the transfer wasn't all that great. I haven't seen this DVD version so can't speak to that.",1456185600,2,936,4.114754098360656
2063297,3,B000260OTE,"""Barbed Wire Dolls""(1976) is directed by Jess Franco. This 81 minute long film is a small budget movie about a woman's prison and the inmates. Lina Romay (The Female Vampire) appears in this film with more or less equal billing with the other actors. This movie comes across as a soft core film but with the artistic merit that Franco often brings to his films. There seems to be an even balance between the rather simple story and the titillating scenes. The women are hardly wearing anything, of course, and this is not your typical woman's prison as it appears to be located on a deserted island in an old abandoned castle. The location shots are gorgeous and this adds to the film's unreal, dream like quality. Jess Franco even appears briefly in one dream scene as the father of Lina Romay's character as she remembers one unsavory moment. It might have been interesting if Franco had just taken the story one step further and made it all one big dream as he does in his film ""Eugenie, the Story of Her Journey into Perversion"". All in all Franco fans will likely enjoy this simple, but intimate  film, which seems to be the hallmark of some of Franco's more interesting efforts.

This high quality dvd looks excellent as it was evidently remastered and cleaned up. At times I almost felt I was watching a blu-ray given that the image was so good for the most part. There is one special feature that is about 24 minutes long, and it is an audio recording of an interview with director Peter Strickland who is discussing his appreciation of Franco's films.",1454716800,7,1560,4.607913669064748

2063300,3,B000260OTE,"A descent representative of the so called ""Women in Prison"" subgenre of Exploitation, B cinema. The story is rather simple, and has to do with a woman convicted to jail accused of murdering her father, who by the way, attempted to force to her to have sex with him. Here we go as Maria faces a sadistic Warden, inclined to the sex with other women. Cinematographically, this one does not go far, as you imagine. However, this one has to be judged as being a B-movie. Thus, I liked the setting for the jail, which took adavantage of an old castle in southern France, I believe. As you might expect, you have lots of women nudity, almost no male nudity, and some erotic situations that do not even approach soft P. The movie is brief enough (77 minutes) so that it can be watched without major pain. Extras are really a plus here, as you have several trailers of other Jess Franco's recently restored movies. The extras also include interviews to Producer Erwin Dietrich, Director Jess Franco, and her muss actress Lina Romay. On top of that, there is a technically very interesting documentary that shows all the steps it took Jack the Ripper (starred by Klaus Kinski) to be restored and digitalized from original 35 mm negatives. I really enjoyed this documentary and convinced me that the price asked for this DVD could be deserved. Technically, the movie has been nicely restored, it comes in its original Widescreen presentation. The audio comes in English (dubbed), and no subtitles are provided (except for the interviews). At the end, this is not among the best of WIP movies (if one can find the best!!), but it will be worth the money to Franco fans who wish to have a good to very transfer of this one.",1330128000,24,1711,4.613114754098361
