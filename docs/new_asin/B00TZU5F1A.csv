7026741,5,B00TZU5F1A,This is one of my favorite movies because of its humor and ciritical  look at who and how we worship.  The DVD set has the movie as well as a second DVD with extra scenes that did not make it into the movie.,1429920000,,207,3.7906976744186047
7026742,5,B00TZU5F1A,"Excellent Bollywood movie with my all time favorite actor, Aamir Khan. Deluxe edition is excellent with extra features on second  disc but would have loved more footage of the shooting of the nude scene with Aamir Khan, a very sexy well built actor/star. The entire packaging is a work of art...very impressive.",1429747200,,311,4.980769230769231

7026745,5,B00TZU5F1A,"Raj Kumar Hirani is easily among the best directors India has ever seen, one of the reasons that his movies succeed is because the man conveys positive vibes through his films. It is hard not to come out of the theatres smiling at the memories a Hirani film creates. My favorite is Lage Raho Munnabhai. I must have seen this film a few times. This movie had so many magical moments that I deeply regret I was not able to see it at the movies. Most of his movies are about quirky individuals who manage to change societal mindsets, right from Munnabhai to Rancho in Three Idiots, his heroes tackled problems with ease and finesse. In PK, the protagonist played by Aamir Khan does the same and goes against the facade of idol worship and religious farce. While PK is a good film, it cannot became a great film because we have seen Oh My God, starring Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. This was a better film IMHO. According to the trade buzz, the director apparently offered a huge sum to the makers of Oh My God to shelve the film, but we know what happened. However PK is also good and sometimes very good and a worthy companion to the man versus God men genre. C an one really have substandard films when two of the greatest minds in the history of Indian cinema come together?
I can't tell you much about PK but it is about the Aamir Khan, who simply is amazing, whether he is finding out that Hanuman stickers can be used to protect your face, using unusual logic to protect his shoes from temple thieves, or peeing on a wall to finding housing for the night, realizing that the pictures of Gandhi do not carry the same worth as when they are printed on currency, he is in every frame and you don't mind, however you feel no connection wit him as you did with Rancho or with Munna. There is no story explaining the intentions of the character, and in the end you don't seem to care what will happen to him.
Although Saurabh Shukla does a great job as the negative character, I feel Boman Irani would have done a much better job and is wasted as a media man. So was the side kick of PK - Anushka Sharma as Jaggu Sahni, she just does not cut it as Circuit did in the Munnabhai films. Sanjay Dutt is clearly wasted - understandably so because of his legal troubles his role could have been reduced. The movie focuses on Aamir Khan and his acts through the run time, the other actors all have important parts but it is Aamir Khan dominating every frame all the way.
Music as usual is the weak link and not a point here...but Hirani more than makes it up with fantastic and witty story telling. PK makes fun of our blind faith. However the final scene where the fake God man and the main lead arguing about the existence of God falls flat because it turns out to be a call which unites two lovers.
Throughout the movie, Hirani and his writer Joshi make fun of our craze for religion through sarcasm and wit, Most of it is funny but some situations are forced and the movie becomes a bit too didactic at times. Sadly, the final scene does not pack a punch as it was in the film Oh My God.
However PK is a great film and is not to be missed. I was lucky to watch it on the first day itself and by the time this review is posted it might as well have broken all box office records and become the biggest grosser of all time in the history of Indian cinema. 19th December 2014",1429056000,,3367,4.246105919003115
7026746,5,B00TZU5F1A,"First off, this movie was not at all what I was expecting. It was so much more!! I loved Aamir Khan in Dhoom3 and as usual he is excellent as ""Tipsy"" - his facial expressions are priceless. The entire theme of the movie was so insightful and thought-provoking. I'm still thinking about all the ""wrong"" and ""right"" numbers that were brought out in this movie. I think anyone who believes that their God is the ""one and only true God"" should watch this movie. I'll be watching it again for sure.",1428624000,,493,4.428571428571429

7026758,5,B00TZU5F1A,"Now this is what you call a movie...  OMG! I have never laughed so hard in my entire life!!!

***Spoiler Alert***

The movie starts off with an alien spaceship landing and a man exiting it. He is wearing an amulet. A passerby sees the amulet and steals it.

Then we see Jaggu and Sarfaraz. They fall in love by Jaggu's father does not want this because Sarfaraz is Muslim. He makes their priest have a talk with her and he predicts that Sarfaraz will betray her. She decides to marry Sarfaraz in any event. On their wedding day, Sarfaraz does not show up to the church. Instead, a boy gives Jaggu a letter and it states that he does not want to marry her. Heartbroken, Jaggu returns to India.

She becomes a news reporter and she follows the story of the alien. She calls him PK because everyone assumes that he is tipsy / drunk. He tells her his story and she is taken aback. She wants to help him find his amulet because without it, he cannot go back home. They find out that the priest has the amulet, he says that it is from the Almighty. Jaggu and PK try to prove him to be a ""wrong number"" and his predictions are fake.

In a standoff between the priest and PK, they make a call to Sarfaraz. Jaggu is not happy about this but she agrees to help PK. Sarfaraz has told the Pakistan Embassy in London to let them know as soon as Jaggu calls. He did not leave her standing at the altar. The letter that Jaggu got was not meant for her, it was meant for another bride there - the one holding the cat.

I watched this a gazillion times...so worth my time and money   I love Aamir Khan's performance in this movie! Such an original story and Aamir Khan really delivered in this one. I would never have it any other way! You have to watch it because if you didn't, you are really missing out on a great LOL!!",1473897600,,1806,4.181556195965418

7026763,5,B00TZU5F1A,"Perfect movie for anyone seeking to teach religion or to educate people about the vices or misconceptions about what happens to the people turning a blind eye or not questioning their beliefs. I think it's a great, comedic way to interpret the misrepresentation of various religions and how people use religion to their advantage. The story of PK and his journey in this film is something that everyone should watch with an open mind as he experiences many adventures while scrutinizing radical and nonradical belief systems.",1469491200,,525,5.116279069767442

Friends were saying I should see this. Loved the recent '3 Idiots' and this one also had a message, Aamir Khan is a superb actor, that droll face he uses can express so much, and his eyes. I found it strange, actually. It's a comedy with a message, but not at all your normal movie nor your normal Bollywood movie. I'll leave it up to you without giving any spoiler alerts.",1465603200,,527,4.387755102040816

7026779,5,B00TZU5F1A,"Its easy to understand the popularity of this movie. Made in a country that embraces so many religions so enthusiastically, I understand the reactions could be very polarized and powerful as well. Packaging such an inflammatory message in such a truly uplifting movie, you laugh, you cry, your really care about the characters and is what many of us look for in a film. This movie does all that and while you are transported by all this emotion you are taken on a journey through how society has evolved with regard to religion and it is done so that it is the truly unsettling experience that it needs to be. Having our hero be an alien allows a look at ourselves through the eyes of a child in many ways and children are different than adults. A child with a healthy home life and parents that welcome a child's questioning nature, will ask innocent ans disturbing questions and he does, with hilariously inescapable logic. Rather than discarding the morality that religion embraces, that professed morality is dissected and examined. Those results are what makes this such an entertaining cut above other social comedies.",1454457600,2,1124,4.829015544041451

7026791,5,B00TZU5F1A,"This movie deserves all the raves posted here
But there's one aspect that gives too little attention--the acting of Aamir Khan.  Aamir Khan is my new favorite actor of any genre, any culture.  His concept of PK, the alien is beautifully developed.
I've seen several of his films over the last year, and his characters range from straightforward romance to passionate social comment (I'm not interested in the Dhoom action movies yet).  In PK he had to be non-human and is always PK and completely lovable.  Nothing like the pseudo-humans Alf and Mork!
For anyone new to his movies, I recommend PK, 3 Idiots, and Like Stars On Earth--for starters.",1446768000,,646,4.845454545454546

It was EXCELLENT, and I rate it one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I like foreign films, the way they package subject matter and emotion, which is rare in American made films (which are also excellent!).  I don't mind subtitles.  This movie starts off as a whimsical farce, complete with Bollywood song and dance numbers (which are great!), then takes a hard right turn and becomes deep and dark, culminating with a fascinating religious show down.  It was refreshing and different with the religious subject matter perfectly packaged.  Not to overstate the case, but in my late 50's, I am working to make sense of religious belief systems.

7026815,5,B00TZU5F1A,"This absolutely charming Indian film focuses on an alien, PK, sent to study Earth.  He soon runs into problems as the remote for his ship is stolen and he's left wandering the desert naked, alone and unable to speak a word of our languages.  He soon learns however that Earthlings have someone who takes care of those in need, God.  And if you go to one of God's offices, see one of his managers and pay the fee he'll take care of you.  But even after paying God his fee, PK's problems continue, leading him to wonder if God is really there.

The film was very controversial in India, raising questions about faith, religion and fraud.  Some religious groups even called for it to be banned.

But it's an incredible film with humor and heart and a just incredible performance by Aamir Khan whose facial expressions and body language manage to convey PK's alien nature without any make up.

Like many Indian films music is an important part but other than one song and dance number it's not really a Bollywood musical.

The second disk has some interesting behind the scenes stuff but is a mix of Hindi and English with no subtitles and alas, nothing really about the controversy.
