7894725,5,6305791015,"The most disappointing things about this series is that this is only volume we could find.  My son, my wife and myself enjoyed it very much.  Kids end up in an alternate world inhabited by all kinds of animals and monsters.  Some friendly, some not very scary, some fierce, some bad.  A great cross section of society in monster for.  It's typical for anime in that there is a lot of bleak areas with towns here an there.  But their adventures and personalities are very entertaining.",1478736000,,484,4.569767441860465
7894726,5,6305791015,"Between Monster Rancher, Digimon, and Pokemon, I believe that this show is  the best of the three.  Monster Rancher is the most believable of all  three.  The stories are action packed, but fun too.  I'll admit, the  dialouge is corny, but it is for the other shows, as the dialouge is with  most kids shows.  The animation and colors are excellent, and the  characters are very well developed.  This video is rad, and I think anyone  who likes fun and adventure will love this show more than anything.  Really.",962582400,,511,4.617977528089888
