3883777,5,B002ACKBTQ,"I watched this show as a kid and loved it.  This is one of the series I have been waiting to come out on DVD since the format came out.

To date, the creature effects on this series produce one of the best werewolves ever.

I have old beat up VHS tapes of some of the series and have been catching up with the episodes on the Chiller network, but cannot wait wait to own this set.",1246838400,4,380,3.909090909090909
3883778,5,B002ACKBTQ,"Finally! 22 years ago, you couldn't get me to leave the house on sat nites if it was burning down! Finally you can throw out those so worn out tapes youve kept for 20 years.

This show, while campy to most, was ahead of its time. Nowadays, computers and such would take over the effects, but back then, alot of work went into the effects and costumes. The stories were superb, the setting marvelous.

The only drawback is the eventual loss of Chuck Connors. He made that show what it was! Its a pity hes still not with us in order to give what would be a hell of a bonus interview. Surely though, Eric Cord himself will be included in the extra features.

I highly recommend this series to newcomers as well as those original fans.",1246406400,2,731,4.321167883211679
3883779,5,B002ACKBTQ,I've waited for this to come out on DVD for years. I will finally be able to show friends just how good Werewolf the TV series is!!!,1245888000,6,132,3.925925925925926
3883780,5,B002ACKBTQ,"This show left a lasting impression on me since I was a young boy in the late 1980's.  Although the series was short-lived, the special effects and plot were very captivating.  Rick Baker of ""An American Werewolf in London"" special effects fame was involved in the werewolf transformation effects and makeup for this pilot FOX series.  The effects are not cheesy and more realistic to some of the digital effects we see in today's shows.  Eric Cord is on the run looking to cure himself of his werewolf curse (similar to that of David Banner in The Incredible Hulk).  The music soundtrack is particularly good - a rock guitar background style.  John J. York (who plays Eric Cord) would go on to star in the ABC soap General Hospital after this series ended, but this is the role he should be best remembered for.",1244246400,3,812,4.604166666666667
3883781,5,B002ACKBTQ,"I first saw this series or rather a clip from the series about 6 years ago. I'm sucker for movies or series which involve human transformations into different kind of animals or beings, thus my liking for series such as Hulk, Manimal, and now Werewolf etc.

The surprising bit was that the series had really good production value with emotionally moving stories. It wasn't cheesy at all, it contained real people with real problems. Even Incredible Hulk from 70s wasn't cheesy, only the young audience of today deem to see it that way for foolish reasons. It was a good balance of supernatural and reality, face it, too much reality in modern shows hasn't really been entertaining at all. If you want to see reality, you only need to look around you.

The reason I brought up Incredible Hulk is because this show heavily follows that series' pattern. Eric, the main protagonist, would turn into a wolf and take care of the bad guys and than move on to another city, and hot on his trail was a bounty hunter named Logan, who alone knew Eric's secret along with his girl friend who we only see in the first episode. Aside from that, each episode would give us an emotionally driven story, all of this in a 20 minute episode.

Add to that, the series' music was composed by Sylvester Levay, most prominently known for his incredible score on Airwolf tv series. Here he gives a great rendition of synthesized music which perfectly suits the mood of each scene.

I wish along with DVD they would also release a soundtrack cd, the score was that impressive.

Overall an 8 out of 10. Great Series.",1244073600,20,1590,4.584507042253521
3883782,4,B002ACKBTQ,i've been waiting for a dvd release of this show for quite a while now...chuck conners was great as the head werewolf...janos skorzeny.....great fun show....,1243209600,4,157,5.32
3883783,5,B002ACKBTQ,"I gotta say, it's about time!  I absolutely loved Werewolf growing up and it's amazing to see it's finally gonna get an official release on DVD.  Not to mention I certainly hope there is a TON of extras to watch like interviews, video commentary, audio commentary, behind the scene stuff, bloopers perhaps Rick Baker the costume designer showing off the four different Werewolf outfits and what they must have been like for the guys wearing them.

Getting to see all 29 episodes again too will also be an incredible treat.  Seriously if you are a lover of Werewolves......you better get this as next to the original Howling....you won't find more awesome looking beasts!",1243123200,16,670,4.902654867256637
3883784,5,B002ACKBTQ,"Premiering in July of 1987 with a 90-minute pilot movie, the 'Werewolf' TV series represented an early foray into original programming for the newly launched FOX network.  This imaginative series told the story of college student Eric Cord (John J. York) and his efforts to end the werewolf's curse that now haunts him by killing the source of the bloodline, Janos Skorzeny (Chuck Connors).  Similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fugitive/dp/B000Q6GUSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fugitive</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Hulk/dp/B001ECDVH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Hulk</a>&nbsp;TV shows, Eric is constantly on the run while being pursued by the bounty hunter Alamo Joe Rogan (Lance LeGault), who knows that Eric is a werewolf.  This series also featured fantastic gory effects and a werewolf costume designed by the legendary Rick Baker, who also did the same for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-Werewolf-in-London/dp/B0024FADD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American Werewolf in London</a>.  But the werewolves in this half-hour episodic series were large bipedal creatures with long arms that could be used for running on all fours as well as two.  This show also strayed from accepted lore by having Eric's transformations occur mostly at random, with the only forewarning coming in the form of a pentagram scar on his hand that would start to bleed.  While this series offers a healthy dose of 80s fashion and music, the timeless quality of of the scripts keep it from looking too dated.  Newcomer John J. York was able convey the earnestness necessary to convince viewers to follow his quest for a cure, despite being somewhat wooden in the role.  Fortunately, veteran actors Chuck Connors (in one of his final screen roles) and Lance LeGault brought much needed credibility to a series that featured a revolving cast of relatively unknown actors.  Although airing for only one season, this show went through some notable changes.  Creative differences between the producers and Chuck Connors led to his early departure.  Body doubles and stock footage were used for several episodes until a new villain was introduced in the form of Nicholas Remy (Brian Thomson), who was revealed to be the true source of the werewolf bloodline.  Despite losing such a vital character early on, the strength of the stories and the appeal of the leads helped maintain the core motivation of the series.  Here is the complete list of episodes;

1. WEREWOLF MOVIE- Eric sets out to kill the head werewolf, Skorzeny, while being pursued by Alamo Joe Rogan.
2.  NIGHTWATCH- Eric, in possession of a gun and custom made silver bullets, lies in wait aboard Skorzeny's boat.
3.  THE BOY WHO CRIED WEREWOLF- A young boy, whose mother has an abusive boyfriend, aids a wounded Eric.
4.  THE BLACK SHIP- Eric is double-crossed by a slick talking man who now holds him as bait for Skorzeny.
5.  SPECTRE OF THE WOLF- Eric solicits the aid of a werewolf expert by trying to convince him that he really is one.
6.  THE WOLF WHO THOUGHT HE WAS A MAN- Eric's job at a hunting lodge gets him into the middle of a deadly feud.
7.  NOTHING EVIL IN THESE WOODS- A witch trying to help Eric is hounded by a man blaming her for his son's death.
8.  RUNNING WITH THE PACK- Eric's quiet caf job is threatened by the arrival of Alamo Joe and a rowdy biker gang.
9.  FRIENDLY HAVEN- Eric seeks shelter in a mysterious old lady's house after being hurt in a fight with Skorzeny.
10.  LET US PREY- Eric stays at a monastery where he believes Skorzeny is responsible for several bizarre killings.
11.  A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE (1)- A confrontation leaves Alamo Joe in the hospital and Eric apparently dead.
12.  A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE (2)- Joe fears he may now be a werewolf while the police question him about Eric.
13.  THE UNICORN- Eric befriends a young woman whose fellow prostitutes appear to have been slain by Skorzeny.
14.  ALL HALLOW'S EVE- On Halloween, Eric meets a disfigured man who hides himself in an allegedly haunted house.
15.  BLOOD ON THE TRACKS- A former boxer who was once Eric's boyhood idol is now wanted by the mob.
16.  NIGHTMARE AT THE BRAINE HOTEL- Eric goes to a run down hotel with unusual happenings and residents.
17.  WOLFHUNT- A rancher comes after Eric when he befriends a she-wolf who earlier had attacked the rancher.
18.  BLOOD TIES- Members of a wealthy quarreling family try to incriminate Eric for the murder of a relative.
19.  BIG DADDY- Eric is kidnapped by a dying politician who wants immortality by becoming a werewolf.
20.  EYE OF THE STORM- Eric is stranded by a storm in a house with six people who are being murdered individually.
21.  NIGHTMARE IN BLUE- Alamo Joe is Eric's only hope of stopping a cold blooded murderer disguised as a cop.
22.  SKINWALKER- A Shaman might lift Eric's curse but several mysterious deaths threaten to prevent that.
23.  KING OF THE ROAD- Skorzeny might be preying on a band of homeless people who Eric meets aboard a train.
24.  A MATERIAL GIRL- Eric discovers that a werewolf is killing teenage runaways living in an abandoned building.
25.  TO DREAM OF WEREWOLVES (1)- Eric discovers that Skorzeny is not the true source of the bloodline.
26.  TO DREAM OF WEREWOLVES (2)- Eric learns that the mysterious Nicholas Remy must die to lift the curse.
27.  BLIND LUCK- Eric comes to the aid of a blind woman when he learns that her fianc has sinister motives.
28.  GRAY WOLF- Eric teams up with a homeless man who is also a werewolf in an effort to lift both of their curses.
29.  AMAZING GRACE- Eric feels liable for an old lady who is institutionalized after witnessing Eric's transformation.

Announced bonus features included 'The Man Who Was Alamo Joe' featurette with Lance LeGault, and a look at the special effects entitled 'To Build A Better Werewolf'.  Shout Factory had scheduled this 5-disc set for release in the fall of 2009 but was forced to cancel it indefinitely due to music clearance issues.  The high price of licensing original music has caused many DVD releases to be issued in edited form, but Shout Factory was hoping to resolve this matter without having to do so.  Sadly, an agreement could not be reached but one can only hope that this great series gets released in its original form in the not too distant future.  While it is somewhat of a clich to state that something was ahead of its time, there simply is no other way to encapsulate the impact of this great series.  It offered frights and character-driven stories that has yet to be eclipsed.  In Eric, the audience was introduced an all-American boy who would transform into a bloodthirsty monster with no qualms about killing those who posed a threat.  The viewer and Eric were left to wrestle with the moral ambiguity of the monster's actions.  Hopefully, with an eventual DVD release of the complete series, this show's legacy will continue to grow as new generations fall prey to the power of the wolf.",1243123200,89,7127,5.0487179487179485

One season it's all us kids could talk about and then it just vanished? Grown up I have to admit from what I can remember it was basically a rip off of the Incredible Hulk where every time werewolf guy would flip out turning into his werewolf form and saving innocent people from villains but still as a kid it was the (censored by amazon).

However, it is with great sadness that I must deliver the devastating news that the Werewolf TV Series will NOT be released to DVD. Shout Factory has had to abandon the project and give the series back to Sony. This information comes directly from Lonewolf on the Yahoo Werewolf forum. Someone who made an elaborate website on this series and had a hand in the making of this DVD set.

Shout Factory had to cancel the release because of two artists (which will remain unnamed) that would not play ball. Sony does not have the individual audio tracks, so they were unable to replace the songs, as the audio was mixed together. The two songs were featured over dialogue scenes that could not be cut. Shout Factory's only option, even after spending a lot of time and money on it, was to cancel it and give the title back to Sony. If Sony had the audio tracks, it would have been easy to replace the two songs.

Shout Factory and Sony are not at fault. This has happened due to the greediness of the music industry.

So, twenty two years after the Werewolf series hit the airwaves, the fan made copies of the original run and reruns that I watch on a regular basis will be the only testament of this great series along with the terrific website at [...].

3883814,4,B002ACKBTQ,"I was barely seven years old when I first watched this show on the then virgin Fox network.  It was only 28 episodes and a tv movie pilot, that ran two hours, and was cancelled after just one season.  When I was younger, and to this day, I was obsessed with werewolves.  They were my favorite classic mythic monster.  At that age the only werewolf flicks I'd seen were the orginal WOLFMAN and, somehow, THE HOWLING.  The show WEREWOLF seemed like it was sent to me from my own id.  Plus, it didn't hurt that the great make-up effects artist Rick Baker(Greystoke, American Werewolf In London, remake of The Nutty Professor) did the werewolves.

This box set, according Horror Hound magazine, will be the entire show on five discs with special features.  The features are still tentative right now, but I really hope they get an on camera interview with Rick Baker and some of his own set or in shop footage of creating the wolves. I'll be back in a few months to review this set proper once I've purchased it, but I just couldn't contain myself when I got this news.

For those who will be whining about how stupid it is to review something that one hasn't seen or purchased yet, I have one word for you, ""WAH!""",1247011200,3,1210,4.4389140271493215
8359247,5,B002ACKBTQ,"When I was a kid, I would watch this show religiously. What really made it worth watching was the main plot, the character development, the intensity of each episode and most definitely the transformations. It was actually this show that not only sparked my interest in the supernatural but, also my deep love for werewolves. Sadly, there was one episode I never got to see. I really wish that this show was on DVD. Id never stop watching it.",1514764800,,442,4.6075949367088604

8359254,5,B002ACKBTQ,"An 80s horror TV classic! This series needs to be immediately released on DVD if not for the fans, then at least for digital posterity. This was a genuinely scary series for its time that didn't overstay its welcome. It had a suspenseful and tense plot, great makeup special effects, and a commendable turn by Chuck Connors as werewolf villain, Janos Skorzeny. Werewolf, the TV series DVD may never be released, but the cult of the Werewolf will live on through fan copies.",1462147200,3,473,4.710843373493976
8359255,5,B002ACKBTQ,"this was the most amazing TV series. I watched it religiously back in the 80's. was just gutted when it was cancelled. Why is it all the good series are cancelled. Chuck Connors gave an exemplary performance as Janos Skorzeny.

This series was supposed to go to dvd quite a while ago already, except that a few egotistical musicians wouldn't approve use of their music. I have one thing to say to them; you aren't gods. get over it. sign the release so many more can enjoy this wonderful series.",1455494400,2,495,4.5
8359256,5,B002ACKBTQ,"Terrific tv show, so sad that it won't be released on dvd.  Series was very similar to the bill bixby incredible hulk show. Several great 80s actresses appear on werewolf, such as traci lin (fright night 2), cami cooper (shocker), michelle johnson (waxwork), and lisanne falk (heathers).  We lost the chance to see werewolf on dvd due to greedy musicians, shame on them.",1453852800,5,370,4.857142857142857
