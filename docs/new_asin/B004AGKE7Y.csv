The only complaints I have are that I wish it was longer (especially toward the end), and that a couple of the actor's in the opening classroom scene weren't up to par with the rest.",1416787200,,319,4.818181818181818

Amazon has stopped allowing one to view the trailer which would have nipped this dog in the bud.  Come on Amazon, we want previews!

4309000,4,B004AGKE7Y,"Surprisingly Good, I first thought"" here we go again, another feel good movie"". But I was wrong, this movie had a very good plot and yes a very happy ending. I thought that the actors did a marvelous job at being connected to each other thru telekinetic powers. Not cheesy but a powerful display of what real love can produce, happiness. Don't look at it as a ho hum hour or so, just look at it and wonder ""what if ??",1416182400,9,417,4.160493827160494
4309001,5,B004AGKE7Y,"I took a chance this afternoon, looking for something that was both mysterious in a supernatural kind-of-way and heartfelt all rolled into one.
This was surprisingly touching! I thought it would take a while to get over the impossibility of their connection and/or them actually being together but it wasn't long before I was sucked in and wanting to know what happens next.
There are a few loose ends that could be tied up but this is true for any story. It leaves you wanting more which is the point!
On the downside, the husband's character could have been filled out a little more, we don't get to know much about him and for the storyline it seems important to dislike him.",1416096000,24,678,4.565573770491803
4309002,4,B004AGKE7Y,"Loved it despite the many obvious low budget flaws, the typical male BS attitude about female characterizations coming out of an immature male world view...she's weak, she's neurotic, she needs a hero...blah blah blah...that blew what could have been great film down to some sad tawdry tripe...and many will hate this film for it and some of the other missteps that often has it feeling like a soap opera, however, despite that....great premise, and very original story line.  Life IS stranger than fiction.  Coming from a family that has it's history of psychic phenomenon events this is totally believable.  Great unique love story.  Coulda Shoulda Woulda been a great film.  Let's hope for a remake that does the story justice.",1415923200,4,730,5.05
4309003,5,B004AGKE7Y,Good copy of DVD. Found storyline very sad especially for the older sister. I think her story was sad even to the end...Life is tough. Doesn't result in what we want. Sacrifice is always hard however it is true to do what is right in all things. Think younger sister was immature.,1388275200,,280,4.403846153846154

4309040,5,B004AGKE7Y,Five star all the way - the 1 star ratings are from folks who never saw the movie or are exes of the actors and they are fricken jealous that they finally made it big time and someone got left behind. Such a good movie.  I was very surprised and thought it was a perfect.  As a matter of fact there's videos on you tube about hidden movie GEMS and this flick made the list.  It's a GEM alright!  A must see.,1495584000,,407,3.926829268292683

The acting was well done.",1492646400,,327,4.491525423728813

4309051,4,B004AGKE7Y,"Cute movie about two strangers with an unusual, supernatural connection.  Rebecca is the wife of a physician in New England and is in an unsatisfying marriage; Dylan is a ex-con who is trying to rebuild his life.  The two share a longstanding telepathic connection which is unraveled in the film.  The lead actors are excellent in their roles, but I felt the film struggled from too many storylines - Dylan's efforts to stay on the straight and narrow path, Rebecca's marriage, a lot of car chase/action scenes, and the interplay between the two lead characters.  One thing I disliked was that the role of Rebecca's husband seemed stereotypical and underdeveloped - he is portrayed from the beginning as a cold, image-obsessed spouse who later is outright gas lighting Rebecca. It felt forced that the audience was supposed to dislike the character of the husband, but also made it less believable.  Still a very entertaining, quirky film but would have been better if it didn't try to interweave so many storylines.",1482969600,,1016,4.952941176470588

4309064,2,B004AGKE7Y,"In light of all the glowing reviews, I felt I had to say something for those of us who expect a bit more in a film. There will be spoilers, so be warned. The premise was not bad, and it could have been executed well (I love Dr. Who, and it is certainly no more ""believable"" than this), but in the end the viewer is left simply frustrated. The leading characters have a telepathic relationship for their entire lives that manifests in brief moments of insight - years apart. But suddenly and inexplicably when they enter their 20s they can speak to each other freely and see each other clearly. There is no attempt (by the writer) at an explanation. The woman responds to this realization by freely talking (seemingly to herself), out loud, anywhere and everywhere. And, incredibly, the people around her simply pretend not to hear or see (the man, at least, is alone most of the time, although his behavior does eventually get him fired from a job). When someone FINALLY steps up to the plate and intervenes, the woman (whom we learn has had a psychotic breakdown in the past - unrelated to the telepathy - and again, unexplained) is institutionalized by her husband, a physician (well, technically, it was his colleague that admitted her, but one is expected to get the point). She is convinced (and convinces her telepathic friend) that she was locked away because her husband suspected she was having an affair. And this is where the movie takes a dive. First, does she REALLY believe that her apparently psychotic behavior of the past several months has gone unnoticed? Not limited to simply talking out loud to her invisible friend, there were several incidences where she fell to the ground, jumped up screaming, fainted, and otherwise made a highly public spectacle of herself - for which she offered incredibly lame excuses (""I must have dozed off"", ""I had a muscle spasm""). And in the end, we are asked to believe that her husband, who seems somewhat controlling (but the more one finds out about the woman, the more one can see that perhaps he feels he
needs to be) but never unkind, locked her up for having an affair. So, with the villain firmly established, the telepathic friend comes to the rescue. He violates his parole, leaves the state, steals several cars and (telepathically) teaches the woman to pick a lock with a fork. Upon breaking out of her room, she walks out of the hospital (after knocking her husband out cold with one well-placed punch) and runs faster than a train, hops in an empty boxcar (all of this after describing herself as a frail, weak person) where she is reunited with her secret childhood friend (who, I should add, is  now on the run after having committed several fresh felonies). One is supposed to believe that the train is conveniently headed to Canada where they will live happily ever after - in the dead of winter - with no home, no money, no papers, no ID, and no skills between them. Ah, but they have their love to keep them warm.",1480982400,,2986,4.633962264150943

4309086,4,B004AGKE7Y,"This is an interesting movie, don't be put off that it's marketed as a romantic movie, because it's not really.  In fact I wouldn't be surprised if we'd been able to follow the events in the movie a bit longer that we found out the two were related to each other, or even had some sort of twins separated at birth thing going on.  That's the only downside of the movie, the phenomena where two people have been feeling pain, going unconscious when the other receives a blow to the head, getting cold or hot when the other is in that climate and ultimately now be able to see through each other's eyes, with the female of the two being able to seemingly call up like a phone call, they guy and hear and words each other say out loud, is never even delved into why or how this is possible, let alone explained it.

The film is good though, both Dylan (Michael Stahl-David)  the ex con male character, and Rebecca (Zoe Kazan) the female character who is married to a medical doctor who is embarrassed by the symptoms such as falling over, passing out and so forth that come from something happening to Dlyan at times, and tells her off and puts her down for it, are all well played by the actors.  Basically the film is sort of about Dylan treating her properly and she can come out of the shell her husband has reduced her to, and is therefore happy for possibly the first time in her life.  On Dylan's side of things we see him becoming a better moral person, but having to deal with the pressures of the crime friends he had asked to include him in anything illegal that came up.  Obviously the pressures from both the criminals for Dylan and the husband not liking the fact Rebecca is becoming happier, stronger and less of something he can control grow to become obstacles they have to overcome.

I did think the film was lacking some things.  With this hidden someone else is in your ear so to speak and can see whatever your seeing, there were many opportunities besides a mechanic trying to rip off a vulnerable woman that the film could have explored.  Also the two never seemed to comprehend the high likelihood if one of them is killed, the other will likely drop dead too.  This could added something, in a sort of paranoia type of way to the film.  I also found it odd that Dylan's parole officer would be waiting inside his home for him.  Would a parole officer really do this, seems like a good way to get killed to me?",1470355200,,2431,4.351769911504425
4309087,5,B004AGKE7Y,"I love this movie. For those who believe in ""the one"" and in psychic abilities, this is a great movie to watch.

Additionally, the two main characters never show enough chemistry for their long-distance relationship to be believable.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!
They sacrifice everything to be together, but I never understood why. They still felt like such strangers to me. I also felt that the ending of the movie was a bit of a cop out. They just ran away to another country without ever dealing with any of their lives' problems.

4309125,5,B004AGKE7Y,"There's not much I can say here that others haven't already. I didn't know what to expect going into this, but Netflix kept pushing it on me and when I saw Joss Whedon's name attached to it, I decided to give it a shot. It required an almost immediate second viewing.

I don't know what I like best about this movie.

The premise is one I hadn't encountered previously. It's a different take on soul mates that involves (selective) telepathy. The main characters, Rebecca (Kazan) and Dylan (Stahl-David), grew up in separate lives on different sides of the country. Even though they weren't able to cognitively recognize it until they're 30-ish, they've been able to see, hear, and feel what the other experiences for most of their lives. When she crashed her sled and knocked herself out, he fell out of his desk at school and blacked out. When he went to prison, she had unexplained anxiety and bad dreams. When they finally realize what is happening, they become (mentally) inseparable. They are both people who feel as though they have no worth and it isn't until they connect that they're able to see themselves through another's eyes (metaphorically).

Zoe Kazan and Michael Stahl-David are pretty incredible. For 95% of the movie they don't share a single scene together but they have to act together. Their conversations together happen on different sides of the country from one another and you know the each side of the conversation had to be shot separately. It flows so seamlessly that at first you don't realize how difficult this must have been for them as actors. So, for me, the acting is ace.

4309131,4,B004AGKE7Y,"The screen for this film was written by Joss Wedon.  Its first version was  was in constant rewrites  while Wedon's _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ was made into a C- film and then became a hit TV show. The problem is the plot hole at the end. Even if the con and the fragile girl make it over the pre--9/11 border to stay in Canada, the plot will require some fancy twists.

Think, papers to change their identities, money to buy such excellent paper, and probably work visas. Maybe she is as he says a natural born criminal, but remember he's a convict whose violated parole and committed crimes, and she has been held in a mental hospital. Her husband has her committed because he's told she is ""having an affair."" There is no official paper involved in locking her up. And he and his buddy doctor can generate documents showing she's a danger to herself and others (she does use violence to get out of lock up punching the control freak doctor/husband).

  Wedon has written the start of a series, unless he conceives of Canada as a magical place of safety.  So, after an almost perfect beginning, the plot seems to fall apart. In some ways a  a great wish fulfillment fantasy that remains open ended.",1449273600,,1200,4.518518518518518

Then this movie will confirm your hopelessness, since it seems so normal to find a telepathic connection, if some god of love wants you to.
Two stars for wonderful writing, directing, acting, but the premise is nauseating.  The premise is that two people randomly selected from the population, one in Arizona and the other in New Hampshire (who are a perfect romantic match) suddenly find that they can communicate, as if in the same room --  no, as if in the same body.  If you don't have this kind of love, maybe there is something wrong with you!  There is not even a hint that something is missing in a relationship like this.  There is no learning curve, no hidden dark side of the force manipulating things.  Even Kate Hepburn and Spencer Tracy had a few cross words -- crossed a few swords -- sometimes.

Only a true romantic could have created these two characters and only Zoe Kazan & Michael Stahl-David could bring them to life. My favorite scenes are when Dylan gets that smile in his eyes that tells you he knows Becca is with him, you can almost feel those happy butterflies in his stomach, and when Becca lights up like a firefly, her smile a million miles wide when she can sense how Dylan feels about her. And the way Dylan calls her ""darlin"", it makes your heart flutter. This is a date-night movie for sure. I can't stop watching it!",1438300800,4,726,4.345588235294118

I was not expecting much from this flick, especially since their telepathic connection is never really explained. It starts off a little weird and kinda slow but when they start getting to know each other as friends it is really beautiful to watch them fall in love, especially since they cannot touch each other or stare into each other's eyes (unless they are before a mirror). It is a really original and very moving, sweet love story. It is on my top ten all time favorite romance movies ever!

I won't bore you with more descriptions, especially since I don't want to spoil the experience. Just trust me. Go watch it. Right now. You won't be disappointed!

P.S. I really wanted to buy this on DVD or blu-ray but that isn't possible right now. Film makers, PLEASE MAKE THIS AVAILABLE ON A TANGIBLE DVD RELEASE!

4309216,5,B004AGKE7Y,"This movie is beautiful. From the way it's shot to the story itself, it's beautiful. I found it on Netflix scrolling through the movies trying to find something to watch. I found the synopsis appealing, and settled in for a lighthearted romance. What I got was so much more than that. The two main characters are so different but still connected. They've been seeing through the other's eyes, seeing, feeling, and hearing their lives, off and on since childhood. They've gotten each other through hard times, and this connection helps them to appreciate each other despite being from two different worlds. She's the wife of a wealthy east coast doctor and he's an ex-con trying to put his life back together in New Mexico. As their worlds fall apart around them, the one thing that remains the same is their connection. They need each other. I won't spoil the movie for you, but if you have yet to watch it you absolutely should. It made me smile, drew me in, and made me care about the characters. Very few movies can actually do that for me. It's an emotional movie, and despite their supernatural connection, the main characters' connection feels very real. As others have said, I do wish that they had used bluetooth headsets so they didn't look so crazy talking to each other, but then the movie may have moved in a different direction, so I understand why they weren't used. I also think the ending was a bit rushed, but that also could have been because I did not want the movie to end. I wish there was more, because I love the world they created, and I would spend more time there.",1422230400,3,1590,4.562937062937063

I could feel them liking each other as friends and then falling in love.  There were funny moments, sad moments, touching moments, and sexy moments.  The ending was a bit over the top but it still worked.  Imagine my surprise when I saw that it was written by Joss Whedon.  Buffy was my favorite show back in the day.

4309227,5,B004AGKE7Y,"Tonight I put on a movie while the kids were on Facetime with a friend. I was looking for a chick flick that wasn't too chicky.

In Your Eyes written and produced by Joss Whedon is about two people who for some reason find themselves emotionally connected even though they have never met.

Rebecca Porter (Zoe Kazan) is a timid doctor's wife whose life appears to be fundraisers in New Hampshire. Dylan Kershaw (Michael Stahl-David) lives in New Mexico trying to straighten his life out after a short prison sentence.

They didn't just connect one day but have been connected for 20 years although they both thought it was just a thing. Apparently their first contact was right before Rebecca has a sledding accident as a child.

What I loved is how the movie didn't seem to rush things. I felt it was a quiet, sweet movie about two adorable people who find each other. The universe has a strange way of connecting us and this was the only way these two would have met. Not conventional but hey life is weird

Unfortunately for these two their telepathic connection causes them to make others look at them like they are crazy. They talk out loud to what appears to be no one and can see what the other is looking at. So if there is a fire near one, the other jumps up in the middle of a quiet dinner fanning flames screaming hot, and put it in the sink. There were a few times that I thought, put a bluetooth ear piece in and be done with it.  However, I loved how they got to know each other sharing and talking through the craziness of life. My favorite part was the friendship they created as they got to know each other.

The actors are adorable and likeable. I had trouble with the concept of Rebecca and her doctor husband and wondered how these two complete opposites could have even got together in the first place. As for the husband played by Max Feuerstein I wasn't sure if he was an angry, distant husband as he appeared in the beginning, a jealous husband or a concerned husband. He appeared to be all of these.

I thought this movie was different and completely fell in love with these two main actors.

Oh before I forget, Jennifer Grey is also in the movie and looks amazing!",1420502400,,2191,4.403465346534653

There is a point in the movie where I thought why didn't the producer make her wear a blue tooth as to not be so conspicuous when she spoke with the gentleman?

The acting here is pretty great, considering that the idea behind this is about 5 steps beyond 'soulmate'. I love that the two main characters aren't well known - this brings reality to it, and also allows more latitude when dealing with the psychic connection.

4309260,2,B004AGKE7Y,"*Contains spoilers*

I'm a sucker for a good love story, which is what drew me to the movie in the first place.  This wasn't that great of a love story, but the concept was very interesting to me.  I think where it falls short is the fact that there are a lot of unexplained things that are never made clear.  I was actually hoping that this was written as a novel before a movie, then maybe then I could make sense of a lot of things, such as how and why do these two strangers have this magic ability to communicate and see through the each other's eyes.  The movie never explains this, and the two characters never bother to explore it, but just accept it.

There's nothing really believable about the movie.  The two main characters are having conversations with themselves out in public where they look schizophrenic to anyone around them.  If they didn't want to look insane, they should have just called each other on the phone.  It was also kind of unclear what role her husband really played.  Was he just a concerned husband of a wife with past mental problems or was he a control freak who was pissed because he thought his wife was having an affair?  That is never explained either.

The ending was probably the most unbelievable.  She breaks out of a mental hospital and meets him at the train tracks... and they are supposed to go to Canada with no I.D. or money, and he's wanted by the police.  Not a well thought-out conclusion to a movie at all, but you get the ""happy ending"" you want.

4309267,5,B004AGKE7Y,"Tonight I thought I might like to see an easy and light romantic comedy, so I watched the movie, ""In Your Eyes"". I did so mainly because it starred the adorable Zoe Kazan. What I ended up viewing was much deeper, more intense and totally engaging so I watched it twice. Directed by Brin Hill along with finesse and giving her characters three dimensions, and of all people, this was written by Joss Whedon (""The Avengers"", ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""). I don't look into much information, or to anything previous to viewing a movie so I will be surprised. Nor will I view a trailer that may ruin it for me, so I had no idea what a pleasurable and original movie concept I was in for. The part that was the most fascinating for me was the portion of telepathy working through the communication between the leads that made this extremely intriguing, and I am not usually a fan of this science fiction effect, but here I adored its originality for the plot.

Rebecca Porter (Zoe Kazan) lives a staid and bored doctor's wife's life of fundraisers and 'ladies who lunch' in New Hampshire. Dylan Kershaw (Michael Stahl-David) lives in the arid state of New Mexico and is trying to straighten his life out after a stint in prison.  These two are on opposite sides of the world and opposite sides of life it seems, but they have an intrinsic link to each other. It takes some great timing and physical comedy on their parts to pull this off believably and the two of them certainly did for me. It made for many light and funny moments and also some scary reality while talking to 'themselves' as they pulled it off beautifully. This caused his friends, Parole Officer, and then her husband and family to begin to question their individual sanity. They don't question what is real to them and in a short time, it is their second nature.

As things begin to degenerate in their separate realities their own relationship grows even deeper, they know that they now truly need each other, are infinitely connected and cannot break up their bond. They feel as if they have always been an integral part of each other since a very young age.  With such strong forces holding them separate presently, the focuses begin to change radically for the two to find and reach one another. What drastically comes to the surface is... can they?

A great find for a movie viewing and a definite purchase for me. I surely hope that you will enjoy this altogether different and interesting movie experience ...",1418601600,33,2479,4.599547511312217

4309272,1,B004AGKE7Y,"When this aired at Tribeca and then was subsequently released online by the films writer/producer Joss Whedon, I was excited.  The film looked, in stills at least, to be a beautiful film, and the concept was quite intriguing.  About ten minutes in, I knew that this was not a film for me and it had me questioning whether or not I even wanted to commit the entire hour and forty minutes to it.  I did, ultimately, watch the whole thing.

Maybe I just don't get Wedon.  Hes been raved by so many who have been loyal followers of his television work for years, but I don't watch TV and I have never seen the shows he raved about for.  Nope, never seen Buffy or Firefly and I honestly don't care to.  I have seen his recent output theatrically though (whether directing or writing) and I haven't been blown away.  The Avengers was nice, but Cabin in the Woods was so oversaturated and absurd and his take on Shakespeare was littered with actors who just dropped a thousand balls.  This cult following he has for churning out made-for-TV movies baffles me.

Less than ten minutes in and I was reminded why I never watch those ridiculous teen soap operas on The CW.

Yes, it isn't in the concept but the execution that this film fails horribly.  The story is rather intriguing.  You have a troubled young man named Dylan who has a strange connection to another troubled young person, Rebecca.  Rebecca thinks shes crazy, and so does everyone else in her life, including her doctor husband, Phillip, who is always looking for ways to protect her from herself.  Dylan is fresh out of prison and hanging around the wrong people.  Then one day they hear each other and realize that they can talk to one another and see one another.  So, they start telepathically dating, pretty much, having ridiculous conversations in plain sight while other people point and laugh.  They get involved in each others lives.  Rebecca tries to set Dylan up with Donna, but then starts judging her.  Dylan judges Phillip and soon the two of them are racing towards one another (literally), intent on sharing their lives with each other.

Yes, you saw how that paragraph started interesting and then blew off the rails.  That is how the movie is.

You have this concept that is utterly eviscerated by AWFUL dialog and painful performances.  Kazan and Stahl-David are attractive enough, but they are so unconvincing in their roles and try their hardest to make their sitcom dialog work, but it all feels so corny and rough.  They though, are the best thing about this film, which is sad.  The supporting cast is just terrible, especially Steve Howey.  The execution of this concept is cringe-worthy, to be honest.  Nothing makes any sense.  Their connection is never really explored, and the complete disregard for the way they look in front of others is just dumb.  They come across as complete idiots to the point where I really wanted the film to end with them in mental hospitals.  The overbearing nature of the framing is also distracting.  Yes, lets have Rebecca twist her wedding ring over and over and over again so that we get the point that she is not happy in her marriage.  Yes, lets have Phillip act so nervous when he sees his wife looking through boxes, literally jumping in front of her to distract her.  Lets just beat everything down to a pulp so that you get it.

Its glossy, and at times visually impressive, but this was a mess.

At least the love scene was cool.",1418169600,7,3454,4.614121510673235
4309273,4,B004AGKE7Y,"A different movie for me. If it's been done before I've missed it. Good acting, nice pace, some suspense and you need to see it for yourself instead of me giving a spoiler. I recommend this movie as a romance with a science fiction frame.",1418083200,,238,4.311111111111111
4309284,5,B004AGKE7Y,What would it be like to be truly connected to another human being? To be completely open because it's impossible to be anything else? Mind to mind. Soul to soul.

4309290,5,B004AGKE7Y,I was super happy that I watched this movieI was a little nervous because sometimes these types of films don't always have a great ending or a least one that makes you feel satisfied. I love Zoe Kazan she is my new favorite actress and I really like this new actor(or at least I have never seen him in anything before) I give this movie an A+ for letting them get together in the end. I was unsure we would see that or that they would just end it or end it with one of them getting caught but it was a happy one.,1417824000,,512,3.9326923076923075

4309293,5,B004AGKE7Y,"I'm a huge Joss Whedon fan and this movie didn't disappoint. It's not what most of his fans are used to from him, but his fingerprints are all over this from the humor to the unexplained.

The one-star reviewer who claimed that the heroine was portrayed as ""weak"" and ""in need of rescue"" was clearly not paying attention. Joss doesn't write weak women roles. The point was that she was strong, but she didn't see herself that way until he did.

I will admit it bothered me at first when Rebecca and Dillon didn't use a cell phone or bluetooth headset to make them look less crazy, but I realized two things: (1) The point is that they are so into each other that they lose track of where they are--it's the same, necessary part of the characters that allows them to do what they do at the end. (2) It wouldn't have made a difference (except by distracting the audience less), because it still would have made Rebecca look like she was having an affair and because, well, haven't you ever seen the looks that people on cell phones get in public? People think they're crazy anyway!

In conclusion, if you like Buffy, Angel, Firefly, and all other things related to Joss Whedon, you will ""get"" this movie. If you have no idea who Joss Whedon is, there is hope for you yet! Google him and watch all his stuff. He's a genius. If you don't care who Joss Whedon is, well, then you probably wouldn't still be reading this, so I feel comfortable saying ""you're a poopyhead!""",1417651200,25,1465,4.438661710037175

4309305,3,B004AGKE7Y,Interesting concept. I'm a Joss Whedon fan. The film was not your typical romantic comedy/drama. It's worth watching if you like science fiction.,1417305600,,145,5.3478260869565215
4309306,4,B004AGKE7Y,Well-written and nice story telling.  Interesting Sci-Fi-ish concept and not overdone.  Nice Whedonesque humor and just the right touch on the dramatic elements.

4309307,5,B004AGKE7Y,"Loved this movie. It reinforces that love is so much better when you are friends first, they truly loved and liked each other just the way they were.  I know that feeling of being one person with someone, you don't care about things, you mostly care about making the other person happy.
Worth watching for sure.",1417305600,,311,4.553571428571429
