8417765,5,B00008G8DR,"My kids love ""doggie tails!"" They watch it over and over again,
which is good and not so good for me.
it's good b/c they are completely mesmerized by it, so i get some time and peace for myself. The not so good thing is that the music gets stuck in my head, and i find myself singing it all the time! The music is very catchy, and 1 song sounds like the B52s, who i love. The kids love the music, too, and the very cute dogs in the movie. I would recommend this to all parents!",1241481600,,477,3.877551020408163
