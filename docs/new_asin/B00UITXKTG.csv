7045567,5,B00UITXKTG,Love the story line and the actors are superb.,1431648000,,46,4.222222222222222
7045568,5,B00UITXKTG,"Season 2 of Ray Donovan gets decidedly uncomfortable at times. You keep rooting for Ray because he's the star of the show, but you can't stop from noticing that he's just an awful person most of the time. The show does a great job of using that premise to draw the viewer into the show as if you have moral input to offer into each situation.

Don't worry, there are no spoilers below. I'll keep my comments as generic as possible so I don't ruin anything for you.

Jon Voigt plays a more substantial role in Season 2 at Ray's father Mickey Donovan. His character is incredibly unlikable in every possible way. Even though Ray is a fairly bad dude who's got a host of moral issues, the contrast against the sleazy Mickey makes Ray look like the likable hero of the show. It's quite a brilliant way of making the audience support a guy like Ray Donovan who does some really bad stuff, half the time for the wrong reasons. Even when Ray is doing something for a good reason, it's usually still a bad thing. Because of that, the show really needs Mickey Donovan to be worse to let the viewer see that Ray isn't as bad.

There ends up being a brilliant duality to the Ray character where when he does something horrible to somebody who might not be a bad guy but just happened to get caught up in the wrong thing and you feel bad for liking the character. Then in the next scene he's doing something horrible to someone hurting/threatening his daughter and you stand up and cheer ""THAT IS HOW IT'S DONE!!!"" (I'm a father of a little girl. Those scenes spoke to me.)

The storyline gets much more complex and dark in Season 2. A lot more is going on and it involves more of the characters, but most of it all ties together, which makes for a very compelling story. Season 2 sets up a lot of potential for Season 3, without sacrificing Season 2 as 'just exposition'.

I can't say enough good things about Abby Donovan the character or Paula Malcomson the actress who plays her. Abby is supposed to be Ray's moral compass that keeps him grounded. She is Ray's reason to do the awful things he does so he can support his family, but she focuses him so that he's doing all these bad things for the right reasons. Without getting into details, Abby has her own moral issues in Season 2. When she loses her moral footing, Ray looses his moral compass and....well lets' just say Ray Donovan gets more 'interesting'.

As for Paula Macomson, what a tremendous job! She is the best actor on the show. She puts forth so much emotion in such a believable fashion that you completely buy her in the role. She completely sells her character as being a poor Southie girl from Boston's rough side who's trying (ineffectively) to blend into the social fabric of the posh Los Angeles upper crust scene.

If you liked Season 1, it's well worth watching Season 2. If you didn't like Season 1, you aren't going to like Season 2.

I don't find this to be a great show for binge watching because the series pulls you into the story, which wears you out with the darker theme. It's highly entertaining, but I'm only good for 1 episode a night of this show. You need a break between episodes to process everything because of how raw the show is. But that's okay as it makes the season last longer.

It's a 12 episode season. So even by spacing out the episodes you can complete it fairly quickly.",1428364800,44,3366,4.398713826366559

7045587,5,B00UITXKTG,"I am HOOKED ! I have never seen such good writing and acting in a show since ""Homeland"". I find myself rooting for Ray and hoping everything works out. Ray Donovan puts James Bond to shame. I watched season 1 then started season 2 only to find it just keeps getting better and better. Liev Schreiber is just outstanding as well as Paula Malcomson. Jon Voight...well this is his all time BEST performance. Jon Voight's character (Mickey Donovan) is the keystone of all the family secrets as well as their root problem.""Mickey"" is an Old Boston Irish Gangster, the kind of man the viewer can see through the first minute you watch him but seems to be able to win most people over. The cast is filled with some of the best actors to hit the screen and the story line is exciting...gripping in fact as well as believable. What sets this show apart from all the others is the depth it takes you to with each episode. I am happy to break away from mindless, instant gratification Television. This show treats the viewer as if they have a mind and know a little about the world we live in. Good things happen to bad people and good people suffer as a result. Do yourself a favor and watch and then never go back to watching shows that ""Talk Down"" to you.",1493337600,2,1247,4.379310344827586

7045625,5,B00UITXKTG,"Captivating characters and compelling plot twists make this series binge worthy. You can't take your eyes off Liev Schreiber, who cooly and cleverly navigates as a ""fixer"" for every sticky situation his super-rich and morally bankrupt clients find themselves in. Meanwhile, his devotion to his work leads to neglect of personal relationships and cripples his ability to deal with his own emotional upheavals, generated by an excruciatingly painful past. Jon Voigt, as Ray's father Mickey, plays to perfection the part of a small-time hustler with dreams of hitting the big time, and gives Frank Gallagher a run for the money as the worst father ever. Other recurring guest spots by a long series of superb stars and character actors, coupled with a strong supporting cast, combine to make this the best action drama since The Sopranos. We are hooked on this under-rated series!",1484006400,2,877,5.13986013986014

7045786,5,B00UITXKTG,"Ray Donovan, is simply one of the best shows on Television. Created and produced by Ann Biderman, who also wrote Primal Fear and Public Enemies and, like Ray Donovan was the producer on Southland, which is currently showing on Itunes and Hulu. Biderman, in keeping with the Paul Schrader tradition of making excellent entertainment out of the seedier side of life brings this idea to cable television.

Completing its fourth season, it stars Liev Schreiber, Paula Malcomson, Eddie Marsan and Jon Voight. The cast also includes some notables in guest appearances as seasonal and recurring characters, Eliot Gould, Lisa Bonet, Frank Walley, James Woods, Hank Azaria, Ian McShane, and a short visit from Ann-Margaret in about two episodes round out a journeyman cast to bring this compelling drama to the small screen.

The show was shot mostly in and around Los Angeles and covers some very familiar sites if you live in that city. Calabasas, North Hollywood, Skid Row downtown, LAX, and Ocean Ave., up on the cliff looking out over the ocean in Santa Monica. Famous landmarks are also used, Sony Studios, Pinks hot dogs, Musso Franks etc. For authenticity, the interiors appear to be shot from inside the locales of these famous exteriors, not on a prefabricated studio lot. I could be wrong about some of that but as someone who does live in L.A. it sure looks like it.

Liev Schreiber, who plays the title role is what is known on the street as a fixer among the rich and famous of L.As elite. Sometimes, but not always they require some muscled violence. He is originally an Irish, Boston south side, hard fighting, hard drinkin tough guy and he brings this skill set to his work.

Shaped by a rather serious and long time molestation of himself and his younger brother by his parish priest growing up , and a criminal father who was never there for him, Rays deep seated issues with his childhood combine with his toughness to form a rather complicated moral code in which he balances his ying and yang in doing the right or wrong thing. This all adds up to a complex character, someone we wish we could be but on the other hand wouldnt want his world for a second.

This continuing paradox in his personality has the viewer testing their own sense of morality. They continually find themselves in support of Rays dalliances with getting it done, even when his vigilantism drives him to the ultimate committing murder. Granted most of the guys he wastes readily deserve it, but if the world were filled with Ray Donovans chaos would ensue, which is why we have laws against this kind of activity in the first place.

As fascinating as Rays character is, his father, Mickey Donovan played by Jon Voight might be even more so. Mickey is a career criminal and although let out after twenty years in prison for murder he continues his low life ways, planning, scheming and thieving, doing just about anything so he doesnt have to work. And, his actions put him and his family, sons, daughter in law and grandchildren in danger, sometimes with their very lives.

Voight is Brilliant in the role from the way he moves, purses his lips and animates his speech with his dialogue. He is gregarious in a scary sort of way, emulating a past generation Irish thug in the Whitey Bolger vain. A perfect counter to Rays stoicism their relationship acts as a push pull quandary for an underlying tension that exists between the two that is only revealed in small pieces as you move through the four seasons, further complicating Rays already obfuscated life.

He hates his father stemming from something that happened back in Boston. We are only given bits and pieces of the reason, but it has something to do with Rays only sister committing suicide in a drug induce stupor jumping off a building.

An underlying motivation for Rays personality is his secretive nature and total unwillingness to reveal to those close to him his activities, especially his wife who takes a personal offense to it. But, the audience gets the feeling it is not subterfuge or deceit that drives this unwillingness reveal his work, but solely to protect his family from the degenerate condition of the world he travels in.

Each season Ray seems to fall deeper and more careless in his dealings getting himself into predicaments that only his cunning, raw courage, cool head and sense of purpose ride him to victory each time. Of course, this is the tv show talking. A real life Ray Donovan probably would have died long ago, in a shootout, knifed or had his car wired to explode, but since he is central to the story this obviously is a scenario the producers wouldnt like to happen, at least not at this time.

Ray has two extremely competent operatives. One, is Lena Barnum, the token gay on the show, an obvious nod to Hollywoods unwritten law that if you want to be supported by the industry make sure you include gay characters. On other productions this quiet edict is usually overbearing ridiculousness, but what politically correct nonsense isnt? The agenda hurts other productions, but not Ray Donovan.

I would credit the actress, Katherine Moennig, playing the part for the realism she portrays. She is lesbian in real life not some Hollywood do-gooder saying to the public, look at me, Im playing a gay person. Shes had multiple Lesbian roles before Ray Donovan, Shane McCutcheon on The L Word Jake Pratt on The Young Americans, Jilly in Everybodys Fine to name a few. She walks and talks like a man and the directors make the most of that showing her in long shots walking in and out of buildings and down halls. She is pretty enough not to be in that mannish lesbian role but clearly she is very comfortable in her own skin. That might be why she comes off so believable.

Lena is fearless and is indispensible to Ray in a number of areas especially for her internet excellence which appears to be a specialty. She is believable as a female bad ass where others try but just cant seem to pull it off.

Rays other operative is Avi Rudin, former IDF soldier and ex-Mossad agent and brings his prowess, courage and sense of duty to his job with Ray. He acts as the voice of reason with the operational and tactical, constantly trying to challenge Ray on decisions Avi thinks are not in their best interests. . Avis loyalty sometimes carries him too far dispensing Rays justice whether he calls for it or not. He protects Rays code even if Ray doesnt.

Avi is a tough, smart, extremely knowledgeable operative on that gray side of street life. He counters the other Jewish whiny, self-absorbed very rich lawyers who Ray does a lot of his work for. But, Avi, is not so simple either. His soft side is that he lives with his mother which gives him a more human quality, a real mamas boy like most Jewish sons. But, unlike most Jewish mamas boys he has no hesitance to commit murder if it falls within the parameters of Rays code.

Along with the very familiar locales that signify the Los Angeles universe both Avi and Lena are an addition on a human level. Where Rays Irish roots, dominate certain other geographical areas of the country he remains somewhat of an anomaly in the L.A. setting. Lena and Avi are a microcosm of the Jewish and gay influence that make up this city and counterbalance Rays existence in the L.A world.

What is pretty cool about the story lines is that at the end of each season you are given a completionno cliffhangers here. Unlike Game of Thrones and some other block busting cable shows, Ray Donovan is content and confident enough that you will return for the following season without leaving the audience wondering.

Ray Donovan is TV at its best. The complexity of the story contains so many derivatives, angles and sidebars of the characters, situations and the time frame, its impossible to cover them all in this review. In a world where network television is constantly trying to shove Hollywoods left wing politically correct agenda down the English speaking worlds throat, Ray Donovan is an island of refuge on that politically charged sea. It has been renewed for a fifth season which will go into production early in 2017.",1476230400,,8141,4.697054698457223

I could watch him for hours - and listentening him for 24 probably;) Never understood how he doesn't get leading roles - I mean in movies -. In Ray's character he's so powerful and vulnerable at the same time; sensitive in one minute and ruthless in the next. He doesn't talk much but it's a pleasure to watch his facial expressions and body language. They couldn't find a better Ray!
If you haven't watched the show yet, you should start... like now. I guarantee that you'll be up all night, cause you won't be able to stop:)

Ordered season 3 because have to see if a) Mikey actually robs the marijuana store; b) Do the Donovans make up or does it get worse; and c) would love the see the LAPD cop and the FBI guy get theirs.",1472860800,3,435,3.898876404494382

7046069,5,B00UITXKTG,"I could watch Liev Schreiber all day; however, I digress. I've just started Season 2 and it doesn't disappoint.  Much of this family's issues are a result of the sins of the father--Mickey Donovan, played by Jon Voight, and a certain Catholic priest from Boston. This series deals with so many issues, which keep things interesting and leave me wanting for more. Jon Voight matches Schreiber's excellence in this sordid Irish mob storyline, but Paula Malcomson, as Ray's often lonely wife, does a stellar job of demonstrating her torn emotions over Ray's frequent absences due to ""business.""  The supporting characters are interesting in their own right and add further depth to this dysfunctional family's drama-filled life--played out mostly in Los Angeles but Season 2 takes a little trip to Mexico.",1466899200,2,802,5.161538461538462

7046285,2,B00UITXKTG,"Oh, brother, where do I start? having gone through Season One I was looking forward to Season Two but was sadly underwhelmed. (MANY SPOILER ALERTS ahead.) Anyway, I'm finding almost all of the characters totally unlikable and the whole Southie mentality and accent are beginning to grate. Is it just me or do any of you find Ray's wife shrill and just too much to take?

Look, the acting is first-rate and it's the only thing that helps this series which for me is hanging on a thread in my interest level. Here're the big problems I have with the series:
1. Ray Donovan is not actually good at his job so what is the point of this whole exercise. I get he can't control his family from his dad to his kids but he can't even solve the simplest problems let alone the bigger issues involving his boss Ezra and the LA FBI head honcho played by Hank Azaria. So how is he able to even keep being employed.
Even the weirdo motivational speaker who is paying him $100,000 a month gets shafted by Ray and sent to jail because he gets all moralistic all of a sudden.  Honestly, Ray is incompetent in Season Two.
2. Having said that the last episode is hilarious in trying to wrap up all loose ends. I won't spoil it but I'd like to know how the $20,000 Mickey bet at 8-to-1 odds on a horse that wins at Santa Anita ends up becoming a million dollars. Sorry, by my math makes that a $180,000 they walk away with not close to six times that.
3. What is up with the casting producers obsession with flat-chested females they seem to want to showcase in topless scenes? I don't get that at all. Even the porn star who appears in one episode is not exactly well-endowed. It's just bizarre given the whole sales point of this series being the glitz and glam (and therefore the obvious plastic surgery disasters) meeting the ""authenticity"" of South Boston crew.
4. I still have zero interest in the extended Donovan family issues. The series, for my money, only really clicks on all cylinders when we have bigger stories like the FBI vs. the Donovans.

Lastly, does Twin Peaks' Agent Cooper realize Audrey is a swinger who likes young sweet guys and is married to Chief Wiggim . . . uh, Hank Azaria?

The extras on the fourth disc contains two episodes each of a couple of other Showtime TV series (""The Affair"" and ""Penny Dreadful""), a short feature on the cinematography, actors Liev Schreiber and Jon Voight interviews and on-screen small-print readable biographies of the main actors. There's also some online bonus material but I popped that DVD into the computer and nothing happened when I clicked on the link. Kind of sums up Season Two--much about nothing.",1446508800,,2650,4.514583333333333

Too serious this year!

7046335,3,B00UITXKTG,"I'm watching this as part of a satellite plan and didn't purchase the series.  I'll admit I like the storyline and the series is certainly well executed.  The problem I had was none of the characters are very likable.  I'm not saying they have character flaws that make them vulnerable.  I'm saying they are just unlikable in almost every respect.  I had the same problem with Six Feet Under
A peculiarity of this series is the constant use of the cell phone as a device to change the scenes or move the story along.  Once you start watching notice how many times the action is driven by a phone call.  Ray must put a hundred thousand miles on his car each year.  Every time he's in the car, he gets a phone call and immediately whips a U-turn to run to the caller's aid.  It quickly becomes a tired device, much like a sit-com that uses a character coming through a doorway to open a scene.  That went out with I Love Lucy but is apparently being replaced by the cell phone.  Lastly, Liev Schrieber, with his unshaven chipmunk cheeks, somehow manages to pull off the hard guy routine.  His wife manages to pull of the harpy to a 'T' but she's just as irritating as she was in Deadwood.",1442275200,5,1186,4.340909090909091

7046378,4,B00UITXKTG,"I just saw Ray Donovan Season 2 this past weekend and while I generally like the show, there were some things this season that just didn't sit well.

Generally speaking, Ray, played greatly by Liev Shrieber, is a Hollywood fixer. He works for Ezra (Elliot Gould), has a wife Abby, and two kids, a teenage boy and a teenage girl. Normally Ray fixes everything for everyone else, but struggles when it comes to his family and his home life. He is not a nice guy. The lead of the show, while somehow likeable, is mainly doing a lot of bad things.  His family is a mess. He has a brother with Parkinson's who runs a boxing gym and has a strange relationship with his nurse. He has another brother who is socially awkward due to his childhood abuse (no spoiler as this was a theme in season 1). He has a half-brother who is a boxer and is easily influenced by the biggest train wreck of this family, their father Mickey (also played greatly by Jon Voight). His wife is never satisfied and always striving to be more than she currently is. Their kids are semi-normal but are easily influenced by others. The girl by her boyfriend and the boy by his grandfather. None of this is new and it was all shown in the first season.

Season 2 goes further into their lives and as mentioned by other reviewers, it is a much darker season. There are some new central characters this season. Hank Azaria is added as a slimey Fed looking to make moves, his wife (what happened to you Sherilyn Fenn? seriously), there is a reporter who harasses and annoys everyone she meets BUT Ray, a new cop that is connected to Abby, a friend for Mick, and a parole officer for Mick. The brothers cope with their issues more in this season and Mick is up to his no good tricks again. Ray's team is also back, Avi and Lena.

Here are the problems I had with Season 2. For starters, his wife Abby, has got to be one of the most annoying characters in a show. All this woman does is sit home, drink, smoke and strive to be in a higher lifestyle. She does not seem to be a good mom (Ray is not the best dad) and always seems to be barking Rayyyyy! (in the over-the-top Boston accent). She harps on Ray over everything and in reality, she should just divorce Ray. If she is that unhappy with everything, then move on! In each episode of her storylines, I just grew to hate this character more and more, to the point that I just wished Ray would shoot her. She has some really dopey lines and acts ridiculous at times, especially what she asks some people to do certain things. Ray is not a nice guy, not a great dad and a pretty crappy husband, but he wants to keep his family together (for what reason, I have no clue). They shouldn't be together anymore and this season really hammers that point across.

My second issue is about Ray and the reporter. Ray, through both seasons, cheats on his wife. He does not seem to care, yet for some odd reason, this season he cares. That is wrong. Ray Donovan would not care. Plus the reporter, as are most reporters, is grating and non-stop in your face, needing her questions answered for her important story, which her own editor doesn't even think there is a story. This woman should have been taken care of instantly, but Ray toys with her and then has to cover his rear more and more as the season goes on. His interactions with her are too wishy washy. The conclusion of this storyline was satisfying on one aspect but disappointing in how Ray reacts, because this is not the character we have known for almost 2 full seasons.

My third issue is how quickly emotions change on this show. One second Mick is hated by some family members, the next, they are all buddy-buddy again. I know Mick is a con-man but after what he puts this family through, I doubt he would be forgiven so easily. Ray's brother Terry's relationship with his nurse/girlfriend is also ridiculous. One minute, she doesn't want to talk to him and the next, she is back in his arms. Ray and the reporter's relationship is also ridiculous. One minute she is cursing him out, the next she wants to meet up. In one particularly dumb sequence, (without spoiling too much), she goes from crying and running away, scared for her life, to calling Ray and asking him to meet her, like nothing happened. What?

My fourth issue is that there are some very hokey elements in this season. Mick talks to certain things that aren't really there, but the scenes kind of look stupid. Secondary characters are given some storylines yet are dispatched of rather suddenly. This is not Game of Thrones or Walking Dead, so there could have been better ways. A lot of characters do some dumb things that just wouldn't happen. I know this is a show, but still. People are not THAT dumb...well, mostly.

While the last four paragraphs have been me griping about the problems I saw, mostly, I DO like the show. The acting is good, there are some very intense and surprising scenes. It is very addicting to watch. You rout for Ray, even though he is a jerk and a bully. He uses and abuses but somehow you want him to get out of every jam he is in.  I cannot wait to watch Season 3, although there were some turning points in season 2, that there seems to be no coming back from. Hopefully some of the issues above aren't there in Season 3, but I know some will be (annoying Abby for one). Ray Donovan is a dark show but you are hoping there is some light at the end. Ray needs to get back to being Ray and I think the show will be as good as ever.",1440374400,5,5500,4.347614410905551

7046388,5,B00UITXKTG,"Most of the time you have to feel a bit sorry for poor Ray as he tries to keep his increasingly dysfunctional family together while trying to do his day job as well juggling the consequences of his fathers irresponsibility and increasing interest from the FBI. It is not easy being Ray and it certainly doesnt look it, but there is also almost nothing likeable about him either; he is a very disturbing and alarmingly plausible character.

Season one was a cracking introduction to the characters and their motivations and season two builds upon that solid foundation. No time is wasted on deliberate character development; it just happens organically as the season progresses so there is nothing to interrupt the pace of the various narrative threads. The season opens with Rays life looking pretty normal  his father is missing, his marriage is falling apart and his brothers are doing the best they can while the FBI are looking into Sullys death and Rays boss behaviour is becoming increasingly erratic. Everything is set for the anticipated spiral into chaos and, of course, it does.  To say too much more would definitely constitute a spoiler, but suffice to say a lot happens and along the way we have some splendid new characters (it is great to see Bunk from The Wire as Mickys  nope, I won't say), the new FBI chief Ed Cochran (who just happens to play in a band) and a Boston Globe reporter following her own leads into Sullys death.

Much as in Season one, Ray lurches from one catastrophe to the next, but season two is much more coherent with very strong plot lines underlying each episode and this season is, darker, deeper and far more unsettling than the first. An easy, light and fluffy show it is not but it is utterly engrossing and the twelve episodes are over far too quickly. Ray Donovan is an astonishingly clever, well written, casted and directed bit of TV which, somehow, only the Americans can do this well. Season three is currently airing in the US so hopefully we will not have to wait too long for the Blu-Ray release (which will give us an excuse to watch the first two seasons again in preparation).  Were still hoping, too, for the cross-over episode where Bluebloods Regan family meets the Donovans  the writers have just got to find a way to get Ray and Micky to New York!",1439683200,2,2309,4.658476658476658

The range of dimension in this series is fascinating, each character in the ensemble a complement to the whole cast, the whole story.  The second season took us deeper into the horrific self-destruction of this family, but made it impossible to look away.  Again, Terry stood out for me, and Eddie Marsan's portrayal was original, convincing, and hugely appealing. Leiv Schrieber embodies the conflicted passion and morality that becomes clear in the moments of decision when ruthless action seems to be his only recourse - he's scary and magnetic. Jon Voight is sensational as Mickey Donovan, handsome, charming, and a sleaze through and through. The women in the cast are also fantastic - Abby, Bridget, Lena, Claudette, each of them strong and yet tied to the mayhem through the men who promise them love, but deliver tragedy and grief.  Will there be a third season?  I eagerly await.",1435363200,7,979,4.975460122699387

Since buying the season is no cheaper than buying each episode (whats UP with THA-A-T?), I just kept ordering the individual episodes until there were none leftit's so good, that you will be compelled to watch every single episode. Be warnedonce you start, you will be in for the long haul (which actually goes rather quickly). I was disappointed after Episode 12. Not because it was bad, but because it meant that the season was over. If you want to watch a show (or series, to be more precise) that is never boring, Ray Donovan should be your 'Go-To'.",1434499200,12,735,4.661538461538462

7046525,4,B00UITXKTG,"Ray Donovan: Season Two contains all 12 episodes of the second season of the SHOWTIME drama. The show is set in Los Angeles and follows LAs best professional fixer, Ray Donovan (Liev Schreiber), the guy called in to make the citys celebrities, superstar athletes, and business moguls most complicated and sticky situations so away.

The attraction of the show is the fact that Donovan is not a nice person. Hell resort to underhanded methods, coercion, bullying, and often unlawful methods to make other peoples problems disappear all for a price. Jon Voight, as Rays father, plays a bigger role in Season 2 than in the first season. Though he, too, is not a decent, moral individual, compared with other characters on the show, hes the one we root for. This technique worked in The Godfather films. Though the central characters were reprehensible, they were fascinating and we went along for the ride. The fact that Ray is extremely protective of his family is his chief redeeming quality and keeps us in his corner.

The writing is strong in most of the episodes, primarily because the writers don't face the same restrictions as writers for network TV. Language is often strong. Theres a lot of violence  much of it graphic  and the show isn't overly concerned with appealing to the widest range of viewers.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include audio commentaries on selected episodes by Live Schreiber, Jon Voight, and Pooch Hall.",1432598400,10,1447,4.938271604938271
