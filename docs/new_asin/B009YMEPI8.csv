5372572,3,B009YMEPI8,"This is a funky,comedic yarn about a hapless geek named ED who becomes a Zombie...Get it ZOMBIE ED....You probably thought National Lampoon had gone nuts and did a Zombie College riff,Oh no ...My fiend,Someone else -BRAIN DAMAGE released this one,So Ha ! At You.

There are hilarious set-ups to somewhat unusual situations for A ZOMBIE,Green issues-Salads with VEGGIES( not humans)-Groupies for the more handsome zombies-and protests FOR the equal treatment of zombies.

Drinking or smoke would probably inhance the viwing of this silly movie,But-It will get the job done on your funny-bone sober .",1358294400,,598,5.351063829787234

5372574,3,B009YMEPI8,There really isn't much to say. It looks as if someone was making a home video movie. The script was awful and the acting was passable. If their intention was to make a bad zombie movie then they have succeeded.  I'd compare it to the movie Rubber. Something just wouldn't let me turn it off no matter how bad it was.  3 stars not because it was good but for doing just enough to not make me turn it off which I would do for a 1 or 2 star movie.,1400371200,2,445,3.879120879120879
5372575,3,B009YMEPI8,This movie was so dumb but I loved it! I really like cheesy zombie flicks. This off the wall and funny! If you like twisted humor see this movie!,1399766400,,145,4.0344827586206895
5372576,1,B009YMEPI8,Stopped watching after 10 minutes.  Very bad quality. Can't believe I managed to watch it for as long as I did!,1394582400,,111,4.285714285714286
5372577,1,B009YMEPI8,I stopped watching after about 20 mins. Perhaps I will give it another shot in the future but it just was not showing any promise.,1392163200,,130,4.24
5372578,5,B009YMEPI8,"This is a fun, kinda optimistic look into the zombie world. Ed is a loser until he becomes a zombie and it starts him on a new life he never would have imagined! It's got laughs, it's got a little gore, it's got romance. What more could you want? The writing and acting are great. It's not done on a Hollywood budget but when I watch a movie, I care more about the story than high priced effects, and this has a great story. I'd say it's good for kids over 11, some sexy stuff and bloody stuff.",1378166400,,494,4.051020408163265
5372579,2,B009YMEPI8,"Ed was a loser all of his life. When his genetic make-up coupled with the fluoride in the water makes him into a zombie, Ed (William Cutting) wants to kill himself. Although Ed was a nobody in life, as a zombie, woman find him attractive as well as being athletic.

The film is very low budget. It is wrong on so many levels. I couldn't help think about gay rights, Special Olympics, and green movement while I watched this film. The humor is a miss as the jokes are immature and simply not funny. It was almost as if they ad lib the dialouge as an improv. The make-up was low budget as was the prop.

It is an off beat zombie movie for a change of pace. It is a story about how a loser can suddenly become somebody without really trying, not be be confused with ""Twilight.""

Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Implied off screen sex. Sex talk. Male rear nudity.",1378080000,2,855,4.265432098765432
5372580,2,B009YMEPI8,I could not even watch this. It is so poorly done. It put me to sleep it was so boring.,1370476800,,87,3.4
5372581,1,B009YMEPI8,This movie had to have pretty low production cost since it looked like it was filmed and acted by the Audio/Video geeks in HS. Sad since it was based on a kinda amusing comic with a funny twist on the zombie 'apocalypse.',1369872000,,221,4.285714285714286
5372582,1,B009YMEPI8,"I rented this video product on 27 March 2013. I downloaded it to my PC and it had no audio.

I was informed by the digital customer support representatives that they could not view the product to determine if it had audio or not, that had to be done by their development team. I may be missing something here, but it would seem to me that this would be a natural obligation of the customer support folks. They simply do not have a means of doing this!

I was informed that their development people would eventually look at it, and I would be notified when it was corrected. In the meantime, it is still on the website for rental and purchase download! There is apparently no quality control at Amazon for their digital products. This is ridiculous!

I have rented/purchased and downloaded other products which are just fine when played on my desktop. The problem lies with the digital product in this and three other cases which I will be documenting. Hopefully, this will provide the apparently necessary catharsis to Amazon to fix its digital download problems!

The film looked interesting and I would really like to watch it. Maybe Amazon will eventually fix it and I will be able to do so.",1364515200,,1194,4.591549295774648

I enjoy the occasional cheesy movie, but this? This is Cheez Wiz, brought up from the fallout shelter your grandfather built in 1963.",1410825600,,271,4.913043478260869
8545306,5,B009YMEPI8,Great movie when you take it for what it is. This is a great low budget spoof on the whole zombie genre. Ed is the perfect zombie...not too bright. I enjoy a good low budget movie and this is one of the best!,1407196800,,208,3.86046511627907
