8043643,4,B0006VXLJU,"Hello Kitty is one of the most well known cartoon characters worldwide, along with her friends that are part of the the popular Sanrio merchandise line featuring Hello Kitty (a white cat with a red bow on her head), Pochacco (a white dog), Badtz-Maru (a badboy penguin), Hangyodon (a sea creature), My Melody (a bunny) and many, many  more.

  I have always wondered if there was any story about these characters, so it was a blast for me to review this DVD.

  Along with my little toddler, we kicked back and watch the first volume of ""Hello Kitty's Animation Theater 1"" which features 8 complete episodes.

  Many of the episodes based on popular childhood stories: ""Hello Kitty in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", ""Hello Kitty and Mimmy in King Midas' Donkey Ears"", ""Hello Kitty and Dear Daniel in Hansel & Gretel"", ""Hello Kitty in the Bamboo Princess"", ""Bad Badtz-Maru in The Boy Who Cried Wolf"", ""Pochacco in Jack and the Beanstalk"", ""My Melody in Little Red Riding Hood"" and ""Hangyodon in the Emperor's New Clothes"".

  Each episode is around 15 minutes long and after watching the first volume, I can say that I definitely recommend this children's animation series to your kids.

  There are a few episodes on this DVD that I have to give a word of caution to protective parents.

  A good example is ""Hello Kitty in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" which features an evil step mother who wants to kill Snow White (Hello Kitty) and asks the hunter to kill her and bring back the arrow with Snow White's blood.

  For parents familiar with these children stories,  I'll let you know right now that none of the characters get killed.

  For example, in ""Little Red Riding Hood"", My Melody and grandmother get eaten by the wolf, but fortunately help arrives and with a pair of scissors, the wolf's stomach was opened and the two were rescued.  Of course, the wolf didn't suffer.

  Nevertheless, these type of instances made me pause a bit but all-in-all, all episodes are happy endings that teach a valuable lesson.

  As for the animation, the target is children and I'm not sure how old the actual animation is (I am guessing it's from the late 80's thru the 90's)  but I think it's cute and children will not mind.  The aspect ratio is 4:3.

  As for the audio, I will be the first to say that ADV Kids did a great job on the English dubbing of this animation.

  I usually watch Japanese animation in Japanese but I was very impressed by the English vocal talent for this children series, especially the singing vocals in English are very well done.  Excellent!

  As for special features, included are the the clean opening and closing animations.

  ""Hello Kitty"" is a good children's animated series that I do recommend for children.

  Knowing the details of older children's tales, parents should know that although it does follow those tales but manages to keep things happy and fun.  But again, although the series features cute Sanrio characters, if you are very protective of what your young children are watching, there are segments that you may or may not want your children to see or hear.

  ""Hello Kitty's Animation Theater"" is a cute and joyful animation with positive outcomes and kids will learn a lesson or two from the Sanrio characters.

  Definitely a fun series that Sanrio fans should pick up!",1218585600,2,3328,4.688695652173913
8043644,5,B0006VXLJU,"I am seriously sick and tired of seeing these reviews about the ADV line of HK DVDs. ""Too scary"". ""Not appropriate"". Did you know that Hello Kitty is not just for kids? Do you know anything about Hello Kitty? Her origin? I doubt you do. Hello Kitty is a wide-spread phenomenon, adored by people of all ages, not just some cutesy licensed childrens character. Did you look into who the dristributer of these DVDs are?

I have read so many reviews on Amazon that the HK DVDs are not appropriate for small children. I have seen many references to scary scenes in which fairytales come into play. How many of you let your kids watch Disney's ""Snow White""? ""Bambi""? ""Cinderella""? ""Beauty and the Beast""? All of those movies are rated G, as well. Death, evil and violence is a common topic in all of those lame Disney movies. In Disney's ""Tarzan"", the last fight scene, if you will, shows the shadow of a man's body, dangling in the back, strangled to death by a vine. And yet you allow your kids watch that with no problem at all.

I think it is unfair to give the ADV line of HK DVDs ""2 stars"" because it is inappropriate for YOUR child. I have 2 children, one which was 4 when we began watching the DVDs together. That being said, here's a hint: All of the Hello Kitty DVDs distributed by ADV Films are too funny and too witty for your bed-wetting, crybaby 2 year-old. If you want some boring kiddie fodder, buy the terrible 1980s American knock-off versions, also available to you from Amazon.",1131580800,10,1491,4.457875457875458
8043645,1,B0006VXLJU,"I thought I was pretty safe with Hello Kitty, but I guess not. To quote the Snow White story, ""Take this arrow and kill Snow White. Bring it back to me with her blood on it so that I know she's dead."" Not much of a kids movie. Stay away from this one.",1116892800,,251,3.7547169811320753
8043646,5,B0006VXLJU,"Most importantly, this is the first Hello Kitty DVD I've seen that actually features Japanese with English subtitles along with the English dub.  This of course makes it the first Hello Kitty DVD I've bought as well.  Amazon isn't listing this detail on their website...

The fairy tales are pretty true to their source considering how sanitized they are, I think.  Also there is at least a taste of Eastern legends in the form of the Bamboo Princess.  And of course high levels of Hello Kitty style cuteness.",1110844800,6,509,4.738636363636363
