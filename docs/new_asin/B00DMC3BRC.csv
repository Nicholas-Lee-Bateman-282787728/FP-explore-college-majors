8594442,5,B00DMC3BRC,"This series is bitter sweet, hilarious and heartwarming all at the same time.  Makes your emotions go back and forth over who deserves the female lead.  Just when you've decided who she belongs with it suddenly changes your mind.  In the midst of all the delightful comedy it also makes you think of what the difference between puppy, or young, love is and what true love is.",1405296000,,375,4.567164179104478
8594443,3,B00DMC3BRC,"The premise of PRINCESS' STAND-IN is the always compelling theme that changing one's outer appearance may lead to an equivalent change in one's character. Despite this intriguing possibility there are far too many elements working at cross purposes to warrant a rating higher than three stars. The essential plot driver is the ugly duckling Jin Da Hua (Nikki Hsieh) who has lived most of her life hoping to marry Guang Jun (James Wen), a wastrel who was informally adopted by her family years earlier. Guang Jun often treats her coldly and occasionally insensitively. The plot complicates as Nikki Hsieh in a double role also stars as Liang Yan, who is engaged to marry Terry (Chris Wu). Terry takes Liang Yan on a dangerous mountain climbing trip where she falls off a cliff and dies. Terry offers Jin Da Hua huge sums of money to undergo plastic surgery to allow her to take the place of the late Liang Yan. Now this by itself had considerable potential to create a tight drama but the primary problem was in the ongoing indecisiveness of Liang Yan/Jin Da Hua to choose either Guang Jun or Terry. Initially I was able to accept her vacillating between the two, but I began to begrudge the director's incessant hinting that first one than the other would be favored. Surely by the twenty-first and final episode, Liang Yan/Jin Da Hua would choose. No such luck. Each time she drifted in and out of the arms of either lover, I wanted to shout at the screen for her to be definitive.

As usual in Tawainese love dramas, the director included variously predictable plot devices, one of which is the pairing of a trio of lovers as in a festive Shakespearean comedy. These parallel pairings were annoying rather than entertaining. Further, there were other potential pairings that were briefly introduced but were permitted to fizzle out. In this category, was a rival for the affections of Terry, his gorgeous secretary who soliloquized of her desire to marry him but the scriptwriters apparently forgot about her and she wound up as little more than attractive eye candy slinking from one scene to another. A second annoying pairing was the contentious non-bonding of Jin Da Hua's goofy brother with her best friend, who persisted in uttering each line of dialogue in a whiny irritating voice that made me question why Jin Da Hua's brother could tolerate her frequent verbal berating of him. The biggest issue I had was the colossal effrontery of Terry who decided to continue with the deception even after the death of Liang Yan. What emerges after the final episode was a lack of interest on my part about whom Jin Da Hua would select. I was screaming for decisiveness. What I got was a disagreeable mushiness. Not recommended.",1405036800,,2727,4.802127659574468
