8122013,1,B000FFZPZA,"This is just plain out horrible, here's a list for ya:
Horrible sound quality (sound was off track)
Terrible lighting
Unbearable acting, by far some of the worst i've ever seen
Terrible directing

So, horribly dissapointed, do not, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!",1318291200,,342,4.60655737704918
