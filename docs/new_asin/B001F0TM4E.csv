3559159,1,B001F0TM4E,"Because everyone was just clamoring for another sequel to Pulse, Pulse 3 is here, and suffers from all the problems that made Pulse 2 practically unwatchable.  Picking up years after Pulse 2, Pulse 3 finds the grown up Justine (Brittany Finamore) traversing back to the haunted city in search of the mysterious Adam (Rider Strong).  In terms of plot, that's about it in a nutshell, as Pulse 3 features more spectacularly awful green-screen effects work, an incoherent and non-sensical story, and one of the most annoying and unlikable ""heroines"" you'll see today.  With an uber-confusing ending, hopefully this is indeed the end of the Pulse series, and perhaps Joel Soisson can move on and craft more films that are pretty well close to being an insult to the horror genre.  Avoid.",1236556800,4,782,4.9465648854961835
3559160,4,B001F0TM4E,"I liked Pulse 3 better than Pulse 2. But there is no way Pulse 2 and 3 beat Pulse 1. I have mixed feelings about how they shouldve handled the pulse movies. Part of me says they just should have made the 1st Pulse and stopped because that was the best one (had no/less green screen, ghosts looked better, etc.) Yet the other part of me liked this Pulse alot too. Even though they changed some stuff up in it and used some green screen, but the green screen actually fit the mood of the film if you think about it that way. As for the phantoms, I think they did a better job at putting some guy phantoms in the pulse movies for once. Rider strong looked cool as a phantom, but i liked the other dude with the long hair as a phantom better. He was more freaky and the story to this movie was better than Pulse 2. The only thing i didn't really like about the movie was the fact that the climax wasn't as strong and epic as it could have been and that the movie was somewhat calm/slow at times. I think they should've had more of he phantoms sucking out peoples life n all instead of saving all of it towards the end of the movie. But all in all, i did like the movie alot!",1236556800,3,1170,4.0257510729613735
3559161,1,B001F0TM4E,"Pulse 3 closes out the horrific experiment that were sequels to Pulse, a tolerable horror movie about a frequency that the dead can operate on. Justine, a mentally handicapped holdover from Pulse 2, recieves a message from Adam, who claims to be living in Houston, rather than her runt refugee camp. Following her pants and managing to either alienate or kill everyone she encounters, Justine unfortunately does not die the screaming, agonized death you pray she suffers.

This isn't so much a horror as it is a loose compilation of scenes that a kind person may consider horror-based. There aren't even startle scares, and the whole plot, including twists, are so blatant you can't hope to be surprised. The only character that deserves to live, despite being a jerk, dies thanks to Justine's incompetence. I began fast forwarding at regular intervals to pass the long camera-motion scenes that make up the bulk of the film, which consists of Justine gazing off into the distance while the camera rotates around and fades in and out. Homer Simpson could've done better using nothing but star wipes. Only get for MST3K related purposes, for for an excuse to fly into a psychotic rage",1230940800,12,1183,4.915
3559162,3,B001F0TM4E,"I'm one of those types who enjoys a good post-apocalyptic flick every now and then so this movie appealed t me on that level at least. It's far superior than the second, by leaps and bounds really and I enjoyed the plot more than the previous two. The movie had many flaws and it won't appeal to everyone but it does make up a bit for how bad the second one is. It's your typical B Horror movie with a touch of sci-fi for added effect. If you're bored and want to watch something mindless and somewhat entertaining then you could do worse. While the second installment of the Pulse trilogy earned a solid one star or perhaps no stars if that was an option this one at least qualified for two or three.",1230422400,8,701,4.2388059701492535

3559188,4,B001F0TM4E,"I really liked the original 'Pulse' or rather the Japanese version, but was left with many questions afterwards and watched the American version hoping for more clarity as to what the hell was going on. It does explain much more of the story, but in some ways it makes one appreciate the Japanese version even more. It's the mystery that keeps us interested, I think.
Don't get me wrong. The American version is also very good. Creepy and dark, with good visuals and a haunting vision of an end of the world scenario (pun intended if you've seen the movie). If a message came up on your computer monitor asking if you want to see a ghost, what would you do? Well, after watching this movie, I think you'd probably jump into your car and drive to the country very fast.
Apparently, people trapped in a dark afterlife between the dead and the living, find a way back into our world through a computer program. And they come back to take from us what they don't have anymore... life! I won't say any more than that for those who haven't seen the movie, The one way to escape a grim fate is to get away from technological centers, cities, cell phone towers, etc.
I bought this three pack mainly because it was only a few dollars more than the single DVD of 'Pulse'. I was warned by other reviewers that the two sequels weren't that great and they were pretty much correct. The storyline seems to become really trite and unconvincing right away in the second film and also in the third. On the upside, all three DVD's come in their own full-sized clamshell case! So what are you waiting for?
Order now, while you still have a pulse. (...sorry. bad pun).",1428796800,4,1648,4.460264900662252

3559246,1,B001F0TM4E,"Oh good grief.

The most amazing thing about this film is that a girl isolated from technology instantly knew how to type.

Poor Texas, designated as a dead zone for this movie.

As for the plot this time out, a dreary girl takes a long dreary trek to get to Houston to save some guy named Adam.  She gets chained along the way, runs into the red guy from film 2, and finds out the hard way what it's liked to be duped (goodness knows, I felt the same way after snorkeling my way through this final entry in the Pulse franchise).

I'm just so grateful that it is over and I don't ever have to watch these three films again, ever (as in never!).",1351382400,,644,4.12
3559247,3,B001F0TM4E,"Pulse is a pretty good movie. I've seen it more then once, and would say it's worth buying. Pulse 2 is a little like a divorce. Just when you think it can't get worse it does. It's really bad in every way. Pulse 3 is better then 2, but that's not saying alot. 3 starts out good but ends up a wast of time. If I could do it over, id just buy pulse unrated and forget the 3 pack. The unrated is not a lot different but enought to checkout.",1331596800,8,437,3.8131868131868134
3559248,5,B001F0TM4E,More Frightening Than Ever. Pluse 3 Is An Intense And Shocking Conclusion To The Pluse Trilogy,1276905600,,94,4.9375
3559249,2,B001F0TM4E,"Pulse 3?  Ok, I know you're probably saying that you didn't even know there was a Pulse 2!  Well the fact is that the second and third installments of the series were released direct to DVD.  Pulse was a moderately successful film although one would be hard pressed to suggest it was good enough to warrant two sequels.  Ten years have passed since the events in Pulse 2.  Little Justine was the only surviving member of her family as both of her parents have succumbed to the terrifying cyber virus.  Justine was rescued by a group of survivalists and is now living as a young teenager in a refugee camp, far from any of the deadly technology which releases the life-hating ghosts.

Justine discovers and old lap top in an auto graveyard and plugs it in...somehow, all the world's networks are continuing to operate even though 80% of the world's population has been killed.  Oh yes, Pulse 3 definitely stretches the limits of plausibility!  But that's not the most amazing thing.  Even more startling is that she is no sooner online when she gets an instant message from another user name Adam!  Ok, but that will actually be explained later in the film.  Adam implores Justine to come find him in Houston where she had lived previously.  Justine sets off on an impossible quest to find the mystery man, going into the heart of the city where the spirits have massed.  Evidently Justine must have had a GPS considering she was only a little girl the last time she was in the city but has not trouble finding her way there.

A stop at a rundown farmhouse provides the film's most terrifying imagery as a man wants to be reunited with the spirit of his wife yet she merely takes out a shotgun and blows her head off repeatedly in a sickening loop.  The film does resolve the mystery of the ""man in red"" seen in Pulse 2 and claiming to know a way to kill the spirits.

Pulse 3 isn't a good movie but it is better than its predecessor.  There's a certain unsettling tone about this young girl going off by herself to a place that has driven away all human life.  And if nothing else, it does tie up everything in one nice, neat package at the end so I don't expect a Pulse 4.

Brittany Finamore as Justine is the best part of the film.  For a young actress to carry most of the film by herself is a remarkable achievement.  If you've watched the first two films then you do owe it to yourself to ride out the conclusion.",1258588800,,2418,4.398648648648648
