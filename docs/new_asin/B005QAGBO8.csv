8483003,5,B005QAGBO8,"The Virginian first saw the light of day as a bestselling 1902 novel by Owen Wister.  Readers fell in love with Wister's ability to portray life in the West without the usual thick overcoat of myth and sentimentality.  And it wasn't long before this groundbreaking book caught the attention of the emerging motion picture industry.

Through the years The Virginian has been made into six full-length motion pictures (1914, 1923, 1929, 1946, 2000, 2014), not to mention a much beloved television seres (1962-1971) starring James Drury as The Virginian.

This Grapevine Video blu-ray release focues on the somewhat obscure 1923 version of The Virginian.  Having watched hundreds of silent and sound Westerns through the years, I can say that this version of The Virginian is an exceptional example of a silent film as an art form.

The story of The Virginian, a ranch foreman, portrayed by Kenneth Harlan and his true love Molly Wood, a schoolteacher, portrayed by Florence Vidor remains faithful to the book.

Kenneth Harlan may not be a well known name in the annals of motion picture history, but he was a true star of the silent era. He apparently was also quite popular with the ladies, and was married nine times. Following the end of the sound era, Harlan's star began to fade and he drifted into retirement.

Florence Vidor (the real life wife of legendary film director King Vidor) portrays Molly, a schoolteacher who ventures West from her home in Vermont with the hope of providing an education to the children of Medicine Bow, Wyoming in 1874.

It isn't long before Molly crosses paths with the stalwart Virginian and soon falls in love with him.
Molly does her best to adjust to the ways of the West, but the constant steam of lawlessness in the territory met with the cattlemen association's form of frontier justice soon takes it's toll on Molly.

While this version of The Virginian is in blu-ray, don't expect much in the way of film restoration. There is very little high definition, the focus is somewhat soft, and there are plenty of scratches, specks, and splices. However, the picture for the most part is bright and very watchable. Just don't set expectations too high and expect TCM picture quality.

The background organ music provided by David Knudtson is well done and fits in nicely with the action taking place on the screen.

The cinematography is fantastic with beautiful, rugged Western landscapes. There are plenty of unusual rock formations, dense forests, and rolling plains with large herds of cattle. The film may have had a limited budget, but it has a big budget look throughout. And be prepared to read quite a bit of spoken dialogue which really helps clarify what's going on.

Overall, this 1923 version of The Virginian is well worth watching and adding to any Western film collection. It is 79 minutes long without an ounce of padding. The plot moves along swiftly and smoothly, and there are some outstanding performances by not only the stars, but by the entire cast.

Watch for a very young Raymond Hatton who portrays Shorty, a lovable cowpoke who dreams of saving enough money to buy an accordion from a mail order catalog. And as he said as the film progresses, ""For an extra two dollars I can get my name put on the side.""  Hatton went on to have a very long film career and appeared in countless Westerns.

So, saddle your pony and ride the cinematic range with this 1923 silent version of The Virginian. Believe it or not, you will be able to hear the galloping hoof beats of the horses and the blazing six guns, but they will be in your imagination. That's the beauty of silent films.",1509840000,,3636,4.765923566878981
8483004,2,B005QAGBO8,"I love the Owen Wister book; it is one of my favorite westerns.  This movie is well acted and the actor portraying the Virginian is attractive.  At least this follows the book in which Trampas is the bad guy; in the later TV show the Virginian and Trampas were buddies.

However, the action sequences are slow & uninteresting and the dance party with all of the infants was too emphasized.",1499990400,,389,4.5285714285714285
