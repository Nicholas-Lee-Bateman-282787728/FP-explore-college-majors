8441685,3,B000XQAS62,"This is really odd - it states it's stormin norman and the abrams tank - the film is actually about the apache and barely talks about the tank battles. I'm willing to bet this film got hacked somehow as General Franks and General Scharwzkopf never came to terms with the ground action aimed against the Republican Guard.  The 3AD was primarily responsible for the destruction of the Tawakawna but will never get credit having been pulled from 5th corp and reassinged to 7 corp for the war.  When the SHTF it was 3AD they sent to the front but all you ever hear about is 73 easting - that was minor skirmish and was a tactically a disaster in which an overzealous commander charge headlong into the enemy - a breech of the corps order of fire and something that they are very lucky worked out.  Later in the day and night the 3AD hit and destroyer the Tawakalna and went on a romping rampage to tapline road.  Had Stormin Norman assumed some semblance of tactical awareness on the ground he would NEVER have ended the war at 100hrs.  Given 48 more hours the Iraqi Army and ALL republican guard units could have been destroyed.  The fallacy of gulf war 1 - the combat leaders at the highest echelons ran the war without ever seeing first hand the situation on the ground.
