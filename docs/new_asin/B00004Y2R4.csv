1369570,1,B00004Y2R4,"After all the hype about this movie, it was such a major letdown to see.  Oliver Stone may be the most overrated director of our generation.  The  scenes are not realistic at all, instead while watching the movie you feel  like you're inside a video game. And Cameron Diaz is absolute horrible as  the chick owner.  Don't waste your money.",966124800,4,339,4.566666666666666
1369571,4,B00004Y2R4,"An Oliver Stone film about american football...mmm what a good film that would make. Being an Australian and not fully understanding your game this  film was more about the power and pressure that falls onto these young  athletes stars, also goes behind the scenes to see the glamour and the  cover up that only the americans could do to their stars. Any way Pacino is  in one of his best performances yet and personally I could not fault with  wonderfully crafted masterpeice",965692800,,476,4.7560975609756095
1369572,5,B00004Y2R4,This movie Any Given Sunday is a great movie it has full contact in it and  all the football scenes are hard hitting combat,965001600,,123,4.125
1369573,5,B00004Y2R4,"This was truly a great movie.  I have had a great deal of trouble finding it to finaly purchase it on DVD, Amazon was the only site that I found to have it.  A must for any DVD collecting sports fan...",964483200,3,201,3.8780487804878048
1369574,5,B00004Y2R4,"Oliver Stone's look at the world of professional football is a masterpiece. The film serves as a vision of contemporary Americans, our ""gridiron"" gladiators, their family life, their money-hungry  owners, their coaches and the media. The franitic camera movement and music  gives the film the tone and pace of a real professional football game.
The film features great performances by Al Pacino as the coach (without  the usual ""WHOO HAA!"" lines), Cameron Diaz as the team owner and  Dennis Quaid as the former star now trying recapture his lost glory. And  up-and-comer Jamie Foxx gives a suprisingly brilliant performance as the  young quarterback who wants to be a star. Oh, and be on the look out for  guest appearances from former NFL stars and Oliver Stone himself in the  broadcast booth.",964396800,2,795,5.015267175572519
1369575,4,B00004Y2R4,"Few sports films show everything that goes on off the field. Any Given Sunday shows the hardships and struggles our heros have to over come. The All-Star cast headed by Cameron Diaz (Owner), Jamie Fox (Quaterback), and  Al Pacino (Head Coach). Director, Oliver Stone does a great job of showing  you the eye-popping hits on the field and the tense rivalry off. A  quaterback controversy, a disgruntled running back, a lose cannon  linebacker, and an again coach are just a few of the problems the team has  to deal with to make it into the post season. Oliver Stone does a terrific  job of devolping characters and creating a common bond between the many  obstacles the team has to overcome.",964396800,,691,4.708333333333333
1369576,4,B00004Y2R4,"""Any Given Sunday"" had all the potential to be the best football action flick to date.  A stellar cast, great script, and capable director.  While the movie was still very enjoyable, it still came up short in the  realized potential catagory.
The cast is the true strength of this movie.  Obviously Pacino is excellent as the ""coach on the bubble"" who  is struggling to hold his team and his life together at the same time.  Cameron Diaz is given her first opportunity to show that she can ACT in  this movie, and she plays the role perfectly.  Even Jamie Foxx comes  through as the ""new style"" athlete who rules through hype and  personality more than anything else.  Dennis Quaid is his usual reliable  self as a ""Marino/Young"" who is nearing the end of a fantastic  career.
The downside to the film is the artsy-fartsy filming techniques  used during the action scenes.  If you love football and hate headaches  both as much as I do, then you will probably be irritated too.  You can't  make out anything in the blurry, fast-moving style that Stone chose to film  in, and big headaches are the only result.  Now I'm not Stone bashing, but  I just think it really took away form the potential of the  movie.
Otherwise, it's an engaging script with a cleaver ending.  Probably will appeal to sports fans more than anyone else, but it's still a  good football movie.",964310400,12,1366,4.619246861924686

I am not into football but this movie had so much more than football to it.  It showed that through the hardships this  team stuck together, it was a real team spirit kinda movie.  It was about  love, friendship, and of course football.  For the people that do not enjoy  football and for people who do enjoy football either way you will like  this.  It has its moments also where it is also funny.",950227200,,503,4.103092783505154

I grew up in Texas and football is more integral than milk so this hit home. Can't believe I'm seeing it for the first time in 2016!

Also, LOVED that with Pacino and Diaz, little miss Cameron was the ""bad guy"" essentially. It could have been amped up even more, but give the era (1999?) this was well played. I loved her character. Cast, production all good. I will watch this again.

Fair warning, there's actual - maybe fabricated - nudity in the locker room. Um, some big nudity. So, you know.... cover those eyes kids.",1479859200,,608,4.45945945945946

The football scenes were very upclose so you could not see much, just blurred action, similar to a camera inside a hudle with quick movements- I turned it off.

1369683,5,B00004Y2R4,This is a very intense movie with Al Pacino and all the other actors.  I thought the dialogue was awesome in telling the story of how professional football is today. The part where the one player wanted to get his stats up to get his bonus without concern to the teams record for the season and put the reality of greed into the game. I am betting that this is probably pretty accurate where personal gain has become the most important aspect for many players as the sport is a very is a short career for most and very cut throat in trades and cuts.,1476316800,,549,4.228571428571429

Among this discord and wholesale competition, where morality often takes the backseat to performance, Oliver Stone delivers the insight of what bonds these errant knights to one another, questing not only for victory but also solidarity, in this slightly dated but still honest and reverent tale, chock full of narrative arcs, both on the rise and the decline--where its win or lose, life or death--week in and week out, Any Given Sunday.",1475539200,,658,5.036697247706422

The cast is superb, the soundtrack is awesome, and the film is shot perfectly. Oliver Stone is a master of his craft and this movie proves why he is so highly regarded as a director. Al Pacino excels as always, and even Cameron Diaz, whom I am not a fan of ordinarily, puts on a stellar performance. James Woods is amazing as the douchebag team doctor. Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J turn it up as football players and LT is great as well adding NFL credibility to the cast which is excellent.

For example, the drastic change in the character of Beamen, the quarterback, (Jamie Foxx) to the point of following the Sharks coach (Al Pacino) to some second rate team in New Mexico.

So now it's up to 4 hours of my life wasted watching this movie. There is not a single believable character in this. Everything seems over indulgent and pushed. Every character interaction leads to long drawn out preachy sermons that seem to be written out of pure football cliches. I love many of these actors/actresses outside of this film but even Al Pacino is at best a laughable football coach. If this was meant to be a comedy I think I could at least forgive the horrible plot lines and acting and maybe enjoy laughing while watching but it's not.

It's a fun movie to try and pick out all the different players and coaches who have cameos.  The movie itself is okay.  It takes itself too serious.  It came out about the same time as The Replacements. which I think is better.  As a matter of fact among football movies this probably wouldn't be in my top ten.

From Ron Jaworski & Randall Cunningham, to Tony Romo and Dak Prescott, some teams transition to an athletic quarterback which is still in pro football not the dominant style. This film was wonderfully cast from Al Pacino, LL Cool J, Jamie Foxx, Jim Brown, Terrell Owens, Bill Bellamy, Elizabeth Berkley, Aaron Eckhart, James Woods, Lawrence Taylor playing a linebacker past his prime, Lela Rochon and Dennis Quaid. This is a movie for adults or mature teens but definitely a must watch especially with the remake crap that keeps coming out. I watch it every once in a while to remind myself why football is the best team sport. If you want to watch a film that is American storytelling at his best.

The all-star cast which includes Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, James Woods, Jamie Foxx, and a sundry of 90s sports stars. A film about an aging quarterback trying to stay relevant and a young hot shot QB ready to take the spotlight. Cameron Diaz is amazing in this film and holds her own with Al Pacino without skipping a beat. Film has great lessons of the tawdriness of fame, the power of perseverance and the toughness it takes to make it the sports world. I was glad to see it on Prime, as have lost the copy that I used to own. Great film 5/5 stars! Definitely in my Top 10 films of all time.",1473379200,2,679,4.271317829457364

1369969,3,B00004Y2R4,"it's hard to tell most of the time if co-writer/director Oliver Stone was making a serious sports movie here or a parody of a sports movie.  You be the judge.

Stone, forever bent on telling us everything we didn't already know about everything--like what really happened in Vietnam and who really killed John F. Kennedy and what the real stories are behind Wall Street financiers, rock stars, serial killers, U.S. Presidents, and ancient world conquerors --this time packs every stereotype and every clich he can think of about football into one long, loud, hard-hitting, fast-paced, action-packed epic.  I mean, if you don't like football, you're going to hate this film.  If you do enjoy the game (and I count myself as one who does, having never missed a 49ers game in over four decades), you may still find the movie too noisy and drawn-out for your taste.  Like its main character, coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino, who rants and rages better than anyone in the business), ""Any Given Sunday"" tries hard to cover all the ground, damning the game and glorifying it at the same time.  Oliver Stone never thinks small.

The movie begins by putting viewers into the very heart of the game.  For the first twenty minutes we see, hear, and feel the plays, the tackles, and the hits.  More realistically than in any football movie before it, ""Any Given Sunday"" captures the physical essence of the game in all its fierce, bone-crushing ferocity.  Forget about any grace, beauty, or polish the sport may sometimes exhibit; here it's all brute strength and muscle.  This is no mere contest between high-paid, athletic entertainers; it's a war of titans.  With a couple of more games in the middle of the film and a lengthy game sequence at the end, well over half the movie is devoted to hard-hitting game-play action.  By the time this two-hour-and-twenty-seven-minute Director's Cut is through, it has left the audience dizzy and not a little exhausted.

Interestingly, Stone patterns the whole movie after a football game.  On the field or off, it's a story about rivalries.  If a character shows his or her face on the screen, you can be sure the character will be in conflict with somebody else before it's over.  In fact, you can bet on it.  The central character is D'Amato (Pacino), coach of the fictional Miami Sharks.  He's in conflict with everyone--his quarterbacks, his team doctor, his team's owner, and himself.  The first word out of his mouth when the film begins is a four-letter expletive.  His second, third, and fourth words are like unto his first.  He's a man for whom football is not just a passion, it's a life.  He has no other.  He's been the hard-drinking, pep-talking coach of the Sharks for thirty years; he appears to have no close friends; he lives in a huge, elaborate, very empty house; and he pays for his female companionship.  He is loyal to his oldest players, loyal to the game, and loyal to the old-fashioned virtues of honor, tradition, teamwork, and the brotherhood of the sport.

The new owner wants to fire him.

Cameron Diaz plays the new team owner, a young woman named Christina Pagniacci.  She is cold blooded and calculating, wanting only to make money by winning a championship.  She has inherited the team from her father, for whom the sport was more than a moneymaking proposition.  But to her, a winning season is all that counts, and Tony has lost four games in a row.  She thinks he's a dinosaur.  Not even her ditzy mother, played by Ann-Margaret, seems to like her, and the Commissioner of Football goes so far as to suggest that Christina would eat her young.

The starting quarterback is an old veteran, Jack ""Cap"" Rooney (Randy Quaid), who has taken too many hits to the head and is starting to feel the effects of too many concussions.  He ought to step down, but like many athletes, he's too proud.  He wants to retire a winner and is sure he has another couple of seasons in him.  When he's knocked out of a game for good, he's forced to reconsider his position, even though his ambitious wife, Cindy (Lauren Holly), throws a tizzy fit at the suggestion of his quitting.  Like almost everyone else in the story, she thinks only of the money and celebrity status they'll lose.  San Francisco Bay Area football fans will see similarities between one of their own teams and the cinematic team's new female owner and its aging star quarterback with head injuries.  The differences lie in the film's exaggerated, over-the-top, soap-opera melodrama.

As sometimes happens, the first and second-string quarterbacks get hurt, and the number-three man, Willie Beamer (Jamie Foxx) has to take over.  He wins two games and everyone suddenly sees him as the future of the franchise.  He gets his picture on the cover of magazines, and he makes a music video.  Naturally, stardom goes to his head and he instantly becomes a cocky, arrogant know-it-all who refuses to follow the plays D'Amato calls.  He loses his girlfriend, antagonizes his coaches, alienates his teammates, and pukes during every game.

Among the supporting actors, football hero Jim Brown stands out as an assistant coach.  Unlike most of the one-dimensional personalities in the film, Brown combines raw strength and toughness with sensitivity and common sense.  I'd liked to have seen more of him.  James Woods appears as the obligatory unscrupulous team doctor who will do anything to keep his players going.  We expect Woods typecast in these kind of slimy roles.  His assistant is a noble, idealistic young physician played by clean-cut Matthew Modine.  You foresee early on the friction developing there.  LL Cool J plays the star running back, pissed off at the new quarterback for not letting him carry the ball enough.  His stats are hurting and his endorsements are running out.  Football great Lawrence Taylor plays ""Shark,"" a linebacker who needs one more sack to reach a million-dollar incentive in his contract and is willing to risk his life to get it.  Aaron Eckhart plays Nick Crozier, the new, whiz-kid offensive coordinator.  John C. McGinley plays Jack Rose, an annoyingly obsequious sports reporter.  And Oliver Stone and former Dallas Cowboys coach Barry Switzer play broadcast-booth announcers.  Then, the late Charlton Heston shows up in two parts.  In one of the film's metaphoric references to ancient gladiatorial contests, we see him on TV in the chariot race from ""Ben Hur,"" and  after that he shows up as the Commissioner of Football.  Appropriately, Heston many years ago played an aging quarterback being pressured by a young up-and-comer in the 1969 film ""Number One.""

Because this is an Oliver Stone film, it tries to do more than show us the excitement of the game.  It must expose the game as well.  The only trouble is, there is nothing much to expose that we don't already know from reading the newspapers.  I mean, football is all about money and endorsements and winning at all costs, right?  It's filled with spoiled, overpriced athletes, inflated egos, implicit racism, violence, wild parties, drugs, women, alcohol, fast cars, and the assistant tackling dummy's stainless-steel kitchen sink.  ""There are no atheists in foxholes,"" says the team chaplain with a straight face, emphasizing the game's presumed resemblance to war.  It's a game of ""intensity"" says Christina.
Yeah, right.  What else is new?

Like all sports pictures, the coach in ""Any Given Sunday"" gives several inspirational locker room speeches worthy of Knute Rockne (or Pat O'Brien), and the movie ends in the mandatory final, deciding play-off game.  This may be the crusading Oliver Stone directing, but it's still just the movies.

Video:
The film's plot and characters may be hackneyed, but there's nothing wrong with the Blu-ray image or sound.  They're championship caliber, starting with the screen's generous 2.40:1 ratio, transferred at 1080p to a dual-layer BD50 disc using a VC-1 encode.  The picture quality is extremely vivid, fine grained, and well defined, with colors bright and exacting.  There is reasonably sharp definition throughout and solid black levels to set off the hues, with only a few overly dark facial tones to detract from the lifelike imagery.

Audio:
The English audio comes in regular Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  Choose TrueHD if you can.  The sound is quite precise and especially well distributed throughout all the channels during game play, putting the viewer in the very middle of the action.  With a strong dynamic thrust, you'll hear crowd noises, tackles, crunches, grunts, groans, even rain as though you were actually at the games.  In terms of TrueHD vs. Dolby Digital, the lossless track is slightly smoother, rounding off some of the rougher edges of the Dolby Digital.

Parting Shots:
The best parts about ""Any Given Sunday"" are the hits.  The second-best parts are the hits.  Stone keeps his camera in motion at all times.  But even this becomes excessive; after all, real games at least take commercial breaks.  At one point we can't be sure if Stone is pulling our leg or not when one of his players loses an eye, literally.  It's torn out and lies on the field until someone with an ice chest carts it away.  If Stone had done the whole movie as a dark comedy, titled, say, ""Natural Born Killer Footballers,"" it would have improved it.  Take away the gritty warfare on the field, though, and you don't have much left.

On any given Sunday, a good, professional football team has the potential to win or lose.  I'm sure that Oliver Stone, as a good, professional movie director, knows this feeling all too well.  In any case, whether he was being serious or satiric, he probably won't have football to kick around any more.",1432857600,,9712,4.885015290519878

Adding to the pressure on D'Amato to win at any cost is the aggressive young President/Co-owner of the team, Christina Pagniacci, now coming into her own after her father's death.

1370018,3,B00004Y2R4,"This movie becomes more predictable and formulaic as it goes on, but the direction is so hyperactive that you might not notice that until you think about it in retrospect . . . although I'm not sure that it's the kind of movie that invites reflection.  Basically, it's about a cocky young quarterback (Jamie Foxx) having to learn that (as the cliche goes) there's no ""i"" in ""team.""  I'm going to assume, though, that that familiar plot is used only as a pretext on which Oliver Stone can hang a critique of the culture of football.  No one comes off well here.  Miami Head Coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) and his defensive co-ordinator Montezuma Monroe (Jim Brown) talk of the lost ""purity"" of football, but their actions belie their words.  They're manipulative and driven -- and although Tony talks about being out-of-touch with the modern game, he resigns his job only to take another with an expansion team.  The team owner, played by Cameron Diaz, seems to be concerned about the team's performance mainly because it is likely to affect the price she can get for it if she can find a West Coast buyer -- and her efforts to do that put her in hot water with the commissioner (a nice cameo by Charlton Heston, seen earlier in the movie on Tony's TV in the ""Ben-Hur"" chariot scene).  Heston looks a little fragile -- it's touching to see a fading star in a movie in which the fading of stars (and their fading earning power) is something the movie dwells on.  The veteran quarterback Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid) and an aging linebacker Shark Lavay (Lawrence Taylor) both play with the risk of life-changing injuries, one under bullying from this wife and the other because he needs a sack or two more to earn a bonus specified in his contract.  There's a powerful scene in which Lavay schools the cocky young quarterback, and it all sounds quite high-minded -- except that Lavay himself is hanging on more for money than for anything else.  Off the field, it's all drinking, drugging, prostitutes (high-end), and a general lack of impulse control.  There's a funny scene in which Tony starts to talk to the high end girl who's servicing him about starting an ongoing relationship with him.  She assumes that he means a ""business"" relationship -- when it appears that he doesn't, it's (as they say) awkward, though arguably the girl comes out of it with more dignity than Tony.

The Jerry Maguire mantra ""Show me the money"" is very much part of this movie too, then.  What messes one's responses up a bit, however, is the frantic camerawork in the on-field scenes.  I think this is a serious flaw, because it doesn't seem to represent anything real.  Professional players don't perceive the game this way -- in reality the game is violent and stressful, but it isn't chaotic: these guys know their jobs.  And fans don't perceive the game this way -- they're at a distance, in the seats, where they can see the developing patterns of the plays.  So what point of view does the camera represent?  I think it's Stone's view of how an ordinary fan might experience the battle ""in the trenches,"" and that's a fake viewpoint that generates excitement and interest dishonestly or cheaply.  It also involves the watcher pseudo-vicariously in something that other parts of the movie offer up as requiring criticism, even condemnation  -- James Woods as the team doctor, along with Diaz as the owner being the ones for whom condemnation seems appropriate, but the rot is really everywhere, as I suggested above.

The acting is all that the plot and themes require. I'm not convinced that it required all that, say, Pacino or Foxx is capable of.  Diaz and Woods are given one-dimensional characters.  It was nice to see Ann-Margaret, aging very gracefully, as Diaz's alcoholic mother, but her part is one-dimensional too (""This game took my husband . . .""!!!)  Aaron Eckhart as Tony's replacement-in-waiting and Matthew Modine as a young doctor struggling not to become like James Woods are fine in small roles, as is LL CoolJ as a running back with an eye on making his bonus.  Most involving performance?  I would say Dennis Quaid as the aging and infirm QB -- he conveys his pride, his fear, his loyalty, and his courage, and the scene where his wife upbraids him when he talks about retirement is the most humanly involving in the movie.  Good work, Dennis.",1400198400,,4348,4.715608465608466

1370033,4,B00004Y2R4,"I'm going to start with the bad on this one, since there are legitimate flaws that should be addressed.  This will contain spoilers throughout.

Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) is reached a little too quickly and easily in Tony D'Amato's (Al Pacino) pre-game speech.  From the very first time the camera pans to him, he is already wide-eyed, latching on to every word.  I don't buy it.  This is a character consistent for not caring about anyone's opinion on football.  I feel like his inspiration should have slowly built throughout the speech, beginning with his usual dismissal at the beginning of it and not fully taking hold until Jack Rooney's (Dennis Quaid) touchdown at the end of the half.  In my opinion, this was the only flaw in Jamie Foxx's performance, which I will talk more about later.

In Christina Pagniacci's (Cameron Diaz) final confrontation with Tony, she lets drop the shocker of why her father left her the team and not Tony.  It's an important scene.  Unfortunately, the delivery of the follow-up line feels insincere as she tries to softly break the full explanation to him.  Given how vicious she is in general, how aggressive every interaction between them appears, and the adrenaline of the moment, the sudden shift in tone just didn't convince me.

That's it, as far as I am concerned.  Two mistakes.  Both are significant due to their having fallen in really vital scenes.  There are other things various fans and critics mention, and I will address some of those as well, but the rest can be labeled as directorial decisions.  Those two moments were, to me, the only mistakes in execution.

Now for the good stuff, which there is a lot more of.  I'd like to start with the scene I just referenced between Christina and Tony.  As I said then, it's an important scene, not only because it might be the only thing she says in the entire movie that causes Tony to actually reevaluate himself, but because it may also be false.  It is later revealed that her father just wanted a son, and tried to make Christina fill that role, which seems to be the greater motivation for the decision.  What I like about the scene is that it is an example of what might be my favorite aspect of this movie: no one is ever 100% right (or, you could argue, 100% wrong).  All characters in this movie have flawed/biased viewpoints.  Some other examples:

-In the argument between Tony and Willie (over nasty jambalaya, a nice humanizing touch for the coach), Tony lectures Willy about taking responsibility for failures, something he shows himself unable to do.  In return, Willy argues about not being given a real chance to prove his worth on any of his teams, yet his behavior shows that, as a result of bitterness from earlier years, he never gives his teammates or coaches a chance either.  That one short back and forth between he and Tony painted a clear picture of a cyclical problem, with both sides responsible for self-fulfilling prophecies.  It is some wonderful character development done very efficiently.

-When there is an argument in the locker room about Willie changing the plays and again when things fall about in the final season game, Rooney is quick to point out important (and somewhat accurate) flaws about Willie.  However, his tone and approach show he is more interested in making his competition look bad than addressing the issue constructively.

-Everything about the breakup fight between Willie and his girlfriend.  It was a wonderful scene, and possibly the best camera work in the movie.

A major complaint about the movie was the amount of ""fluff"" or filler scenes that had nothing to do with football and seemingly little to do with the plot.  An example of this would be Willie's commercial/rap single being watched by the coaches, or a rather large portion of the interview between Willie and Jack Rose (John C. McGinley).  While smaller portions of these scenes would have served plot purposes and had negligible effect on character development (by this point, Willie's character is fairly well understood, or should be), I feel that what felt like the ""extended versions"" of these scenes were forced on us to illustrate some of the points being made in the movie (some referenced by Tony directly), about how the game was being taken over by analysts and greed, and how Tony doesn't really love the sport any more, or at least what he feels it has become.  This theory is supported by the fact that he has to watch the music video and interview despite not wanting to.  We're supposed to be irritated by these diversions, and based on a number of reviews, I'd say it was successful, if not successfully interpreted.

Two other complaints kinda rolled into one.  1) There isn't a character I really sympathize with and 2) this movie doesn't seem to have an underlying message or point.  I agree completely, and I think this is intentional.  I feel the purpose of the film was to show some of the darker aspects of football and the fact that none of the characters come off looking admirable is one of the ways that is accomplished.

There are, of course, other things to like.  Lawrence Taylor was wonderful, even if he was pretty much playing Lawrence Taylor.  He added a lot of humor and real flavor.  James Woods, Cameron Diaz and Lauren Holly (especially Lauren Holly) did a great job of portraying horrible people without seeming inhuman.  Again, Diaz could have been better, but for the most part I enjoyed her performance, and she sold the character perfectly in her reaction to Charleton Heston's accusation.

All in all, this may not be an excellent sports movie, but it features an impressive number of interestingly flawed, believable characters and doesn't end where most sports movies would, which I appreciate.  I hope this review helps you see something more in this movie and I am hoping to hear any comments you might have, as this is my first significant review.",1383177600,,5927,4.777013752455796

1370047,4,B00004Y2R4,"Any Given Sunday (Oliver Stone, 1999)
[originally posted 27Dec1999]

Forget the well-written script, forget the acting, forget Oliver Stone's best direction work in years, forget an almost-perfect ensemble cast, forget gorgeous (if overdone) cinematography, forget perfect sound. Well, don't forget it, I guess, because we'll come back to it, but put it in the back of your head for a while. The true star of Any Given Sunday is the incredible choreography. A good deal of this movie takes place on the gridiron itself as twenty-two men pound each other into submission every Sunday. Bones strain and crack, blood flows, muscles and ligaments tear, and it's all captured oh so lovingly on film. It's difficult to watch for a non-football fan like myself (don't know any football fans who have seen it yet, so can't comment), but even while flinching at the sound of a body hitting the ground after being battered by two even bigger bodies in midair, it's still visually stunning. Just the football scenes alone would be enough to lift this movie to above-average status.

That said, Any Given Sunday just plain rocks. It's the story of a whole lot of seemingly morally bankrupt people whose lives have been negatively affected by football. Coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) has been with the Miami Sharks since their beginnings, and quarterback Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid) has been there with him for well over half the team's existence. But Rooney is thirty-eight, well beyond the normal end of career for a football quarterback, and as should be expected, he goes down one too many times and screws something up in his chest. String 2 QB goes down after one play with a knee injury. That leaves D'Amato's third and last hope, a benchwarmer named Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). Beamen ignores the playbook, calls his own plays, and turns the team around. Of course, in favoring one receiver and trash-talking (deservedly, it should be noted) the team's defensive line, he makes a whole lot of enemies inside the club, with the expected results. Add to this shortlist the team founder's widow (Ann-Margaret), an alcoholic whose sole desire is to get away form the game, and daughter (Cameron Diaz), the team's present GM, who also wants to get away from the game, but with as much money as she can get for selling the team.

Despite the fact that every one of these folks gives an excellent performance (save the woefully miscast Diaz, who does the best she can with her role), the one person in this film who truly shines in the role of ""person whose personality has been completely warped by football"" is Cap Rooney's trophy wife, Cindy (Lauren Holly). The woman is a flaming, gold-plated, iron-balled, moneygrubbing psycho bitch from hell, and Holly plays the role to the hilt. This leads me to believe that switching Diaz and Holly would have been in the best interests of the film; Holly would have made a great shady GM. But you play with what you got.

Another person to single out is Jamie Foxx, who's always been relegated to minor comedic roles before this. Stone threw him in with the big boys here, and many of them (Pacino, Quaid, James Woods and Matt Modine as the team's orthopedists, etc.). Foxx holds his own. It's not an Oscar-caliber performance, but Foxx shows he's more than capable of playing a dramatic role and playing it well. Hopefully this will be the breakout role for Foxx. He's helped by a minor cast and a bunch of football-related cameos who obviously love being here. None of them looked familiar to me, save James Brown (yes, the guy from The World's Funniest) as the defensive coach for the Sharks and football great Lawrence ""L.T."" Taylor as a rival coach who spends more time taunting Pacino than he does coaching his own team.

As for Stone, what's he doing here? Maybe he finally realized what the rest of the world did, that he went way off the deep end after Platoon. If this is his attempt at atonement, he bought himself a few centuries' worth of indulgence. The politics here are the politics of teamwork, aside from a minor subplot with Cameron Diaz soaking Miami's mayor for money for a new stadium. There are no ludicrous conspiracies, no embittered war veterans, no high-profile politicians to be ridiculed, only a bunch of people who have been pushed to the limit by a sport. It's The Godfather without the Mafia, and Stone handles it as capably as he's handled anything. The style is the same-- lots of darkness, gloom, and somewhat glorified violence-- but it's nice to see it applied to something nonpolitical for the first time since his highly-underrated horror classic The Hand.

So having praised it to the high heavens, what's wrong with the movie? Why isn't it the greatest film of all time? A few minor things, mostly. I've already mentioned Diaz. And some of the cinematography-- if you cut out all of the slow-motion long bomb passes except for the first one, the movie might have been fifteen minutes shorter (and it runs well over two and a half hours). The soundtrack, while oddly effective, gets annoying after a while; you hear a lot of songs, and it's a great mix of stuff spanning the sixties to Kid Rock's most recent single, but you never hear more than a few seconds of any song. Even the now-banned ""Rock and Roll Part Two"" gets a few bars early on.

Excellent filmmaking, especially when held up against the last seventeen years of Oliver Stone's career. ****",1375142400,,5424,4.7699680511182105

I thought this movie was really fun to watch at the moment, because Colin Kaepernick is somewhat similar to Willie Beamen in terms of how he has kind of randomly and quickly ascended to football stardom.

1370082,3,B00004Y2R4,"I enjoy this movie and have had the standard DVD in my collection for a long time.  Just got the BluRay version and must say that I am greatly disappointed in the transfer.  I won't get into the ad nausium summaries of the plot that so many here insist on writing about, just the quality of the disc.  Here is a movie filled with crowd scenes, party scenes and, of course, multiple football scenes full of crashes, body blows and a conundrum of other audio ambiences and yet the quality of the audio mixing is downright lousy.  The surround channels are rarely used and for a movie of this nature, that is downright criminal.  A movie like this should have perfect audio mixing to the point of being a demo disc yet, other than the center and front left and rights(and not very much of those even) there really is no surround mixing.  In addition, the dialogue channels is very poorly leveled with the other channels.  This made it difficult to hear the dialogue at times as it was fighting the soundtrack which was mixed too high and hot.  The video transfer was a B at best.  Colors were nicely presented with no bleeding or stair stepping but there was considerable video noise in some scenes while almost none in others.  The sauna scene towards the end of the film had a great deal of video noise which you might not see due to the steam but it was most definitely there.
On a positive note, the blu ray dvd has a literal ton of extras included deleted scenes, extended scenes, even audition scenes.  The weird thing is that once a extra was finished, the DVD did not go back to the Extras menu but went straight to the movie again making you have to go back to the menu and navigate to the extras and pick another. The worst interactive menu I have ever come across.
This is a fine movie, have always liked it and still do, but the Blu Ray provides little, if any, improvement over the original release.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

1370086,1,B00004Y2R4,"... because I found the characters and the life style depicted in this film profoundly disgusting. I won't waste your time with details; there are plenty of other reviews. Let's just say that I hope Oliver Stone was ""exaggerating"" for commercial purposes that have nothing to do with reality. I'm a once-a-year football fan at most, but if the world of professional football is as lurid and vile as Stone portrays it, I'd regret even a single hour staring at the Tube or a single ticket's price. Actually one of the sour egomaniacs in the film laments the state of things in pro ball post TV and preaches that the sport itself is ""pure"". Or was ""pure"". Or may still be ""pure"" in some high school environment in Arcadia. If ""purity"" grows up to be this sort of swinishness, there's a case to be made for purging ""our"" schools of sports.

Aside from socio-moralistic matters, this is a lousy film on its own terms. There's way too much ""cinerrhea"" -- too many flittery fuzzy gimmicks and film editor's flummeries. The action moments are simply spat out without any build-up, and then repeated ad nauseam. How many times does it work to show a passed football in slooow motion soaring thirty yards over the hunkered hulks of the linemen for a stop-action touchdown? And the acting is lousy, with the exception of Charlton Heston's 20-second coup as the commissioner and Cameron Diaz's warp-speed performance as a 3!T$X from H&99. Even that loathly masterpiece of actressing is spoiled in the last minutes of the film by Diaz's utterly unconvincing repentance, but that's not Diaz's fault; it's Stone's and John Logan's, for scribbling such an awful script. Diaz's instantaneous reformation isn't alone; the showboating quarterback played by Jamie Foxx has a ""Road to Damascus"" conversion also, that's laughably implausible. And if I were poor Dennis Quaid, I'd sue to have my name removed from the titles; Quaid's no Lawrence Olivier, to be sure, but he deserved at least half a chance to earn his outrageous salary by being given a role that didn't doom him to looking like a meatball.",1328140800,4,2083,4.834733893557423
1370087,1,B00004Y2R4,"This is a complete waste of a great cast. I'm midway through the film and all I can think is that Stone's liberal politics (the belief that failure is what to strive for and losers should be emulated and rewarded) has been made into the worst football film ever. Filled with caricatures and stereo-types, class warfare and ridiculous plotline (or lack thereof) all for the purpose of saying has-beens and failures is what lifes all about. It's all summed up with Pacino's assinine ""my life sucks"" speech right before the playoff game... seriously, Ollie, stick to movies about hollywood and music.

I thought it couldn't get worse, until the 'money grubbing, non-team player', after actually getting the team to the playoffs in the first place, isn't allow to start. Then when the has-been folds mid-game and he's allowed back on the field, Oh! What a surprise! He's learned the errors of his ways (and it only took 2 quarters of the final game) and he's now a team player... and guess what, all is forgiven and his team mates love him. What a load of crap.

Finally, Cameron Diaz, after being busted DURING the final game for attempting to move to a more profitable location, sees the error of her evil capitalist ways in the closing credits and gives a speech that is so contrived and inpausable that all it accomplishes is making me want to throw up.

I only wish I'd bought it for the $0.01 it's going for now, so I'd feel better when I throw it in the trash.",1327017600,2,1463,4.576335877862595

Any Given Sunday, Oliver Stone's vision of football as populated by he-men (and Cameron Diaz), doesn't win any points for subtlety but it's an entertaining 150 minute film that scurries along and seldom slows down; I don't think it's terribly memorable, but its entertainment value cannot be denied.

Having ridden the bench for years because of a string of bad luck stories and perhaps insufficient character, Willie Beaman seizes what may be his last chance, and lights up the field with a raw display of athletic prowess. His stunning performance over several games is so outstanding and fresh it seems to augur a new era in the history of this Miami franchise, and forces aging coach Tony D'Amato to reevaluate his time-tested values and strategies and begin to confront the fact that the game, as well as post-modern life may be passing him by. Wild and outrageous, Any Given Sunday gives you a glimpses into an athletic world not too far from the real thing.

1370101,5,B00004Y2R4,"I really enjoyed this film even though I am not a football fan and have only watched a few games in my whole life, it is obvious Stone is a real fan and made this as his love letter to the sport.  It is fun trying to pick out all the real football stars who have cameos in this film, and even Charlton Heston!!!.  Pacino's speech about the tradition of football to the young Jamie Foxx is quite inspiring.  Foxx really sells his role and convinces me he deserves his star on the hollywood sidewalk.  Lawrence Taylor is a lot of fun to watch.  The film really covers all the bases and you get to feel what it is like to be in the huddle under stress and trying to spot the receiver through the chaos.  My only criticism is that the shaky cam thing was a bit overdone, and I would have liked to have seen fewer jump cuts in the middle of the action, and Cameron Diaz was a bit hard to take.  I think it is a 5 star film on balance for what it acheives as a memorial to the sport in all its facets good bad and ugly.",1259366400,,1013,3.960591133004926

Blu-Ray makes the fooball scenes almost as good as the Dallas mega screen [especially on my 120"" projection screen] and anyone following today's NFL scene is reminded that the more it changes the more it stays the same--just more so.

1370104,4,B00004Y2R4,"Like the players in American football, Oliver Stone's had his ups and downs.  Any Given Sunday is actually one of the director's most accessible works and resonates more with Stone's earlier and mid period work like Wall Street than it does with his work on US presidents.  Any Give Sunday works because it's coherent, not left field like the Doors, or rambling like the stylish but disjointed Alexander.

As with most of his best tales, Any Given Sunday presents a battlefield of morality.  Every single person in the film - the Coach, the Quarterback, the Hotshot Team owner, etc have to decide what it is they have to do to survive, but also to honour their own integrity.  With a star cast that's easy on the eye - Diaz, Quaid, Foxx, and Pacino returning to form, Any Given Sunday may have received mixed reviews but that's because Stone refuses to make a film that's easily classifiable (it's not your typical American football movie nor a serious drama).

The film itself is one of my favorite sports films. The film is unapologetic and the characters are raw and fearless. The film is edgy, and hot, visually. Cameron Diaz, Al Pacino and the rest are perfect for this fast-paced film, and their performances are believable and as well cast.

1370108,5,B00004Y2R4,"Among Oliver Stone's work includes ""Any Given Sunday"" (1999), as good and realistic a sports movie as has ever been made. It features an over-the-top performance by Al Pacino as a veteran pro football coach who can still motivate his over-paid, over-sexed, over-drugged, slightly thuggish, mostly black (except for a few White Aryan Brotherhood linemen) mercenaries with a speech that sends Knute Rockne to the bench.
He reportedly is working on the story of the 1934 Republican industrialists who recruited Marine hero Smedley Butler to overthrow Franklin Roosevelt, which was the genesis of ""Seven Days in May"". We are still waiting for Tinsel Town to take on Kennedy stealing the 1960 election. It could be a long wait.

1370109,3,B00004Y2R4,"The game of American Football is, in many ways, a perfect movie sport. First of all, the game progresses in fits and starts, giving plenty of opportunity for dramatic buildup and suspense. Second, the offence and the defense take turns on the playing field, allowing the filmmakers to cut away to active players on the sidelines. Third, and probably most important, football is a sport that closely resembles an ancient battlefield; tight formations of armored men violently advancing and retrieving. This has been the stock and trade of action cinema from Birth Of A Nation to Braveheart.

Oliver Stone's ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is certainly an action film. It throws you right on the field in the very first sequence and keeps you there for a good forty minutes of it's near 3 hours. Yet somehow, you get very little feeling for how the game is actually played. Sure, there's the controlled chaos, the violent hits, and the occasionally acrobatic intensity of the running game... but the game is somehow lost. Too bad because all the elements seem to be there.

Al Pacino plays Tony D'Amato, a legendary head coach of the Miami Sharks. James Woods sinks his sharp little teeth into the team's sleazbag doctor. And Cameron Diaz, somewhat against type, is the bitch-on-wheels team owner. On top of that there's quarterbacks Jamie Foxx and Dennis Quade, Jim Brown, L.L. Cool J, Matthew Modine, and Ann-Margaret in a wonderful cameo. Oliver Stone is the ringmaster, and who could be a better choice? Someone who's both played the game (in college) as well as seen the battlefield (in Viet Nam). ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, unfortunately, is somewhat less than the sum of its parts; failing to live up to its promise as the ""ultimate football film"".

Now, don't get me wrong, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is full of fun touches. The performances are uniformly terrific and the action is often spectacular. But the film gets so caught up in clich that it gets difficult to take by the time it's over. Of course, all sports films rely on a certain amount of clich; it's really just a part of the package. But do we need to see all of the sports film cliches packed into one film? There's the over-the-hill quarterback looking for one more shot, the young star learning how to be a team player, the evil money-grubbing owner who doesn't give a damn about the players or the integrity of the game, and the idealistic coach trying to hold the team together and to take them to the playoffs, etc, etc, etc.. All this, as always, culminates in the ""big game"" finale that miraculously solves all dilemmas and resolves all conflicts. The film's biggest surprise (such as it is) comes over the closing credits, by which time I couldn't care less.

Here's a couple more small gripes. One: all through the film everyone is referring to Coach D'Amato as an ""old dinosaur"". Huh? Who are they talking about? Pacino looks great, not a day over fifty! Compared to some of the geriatric geezers coaching in the NFL now, he's a youngster. Two: not a single field goal is kicked in the entire three hours. Come on! Show one field goal! Just one.

1370122,4,B00004Y2R4,"I am not a football fan however I did find this film entertaining. As you'll read here this film draws mixed emotions from many here who have seen it. Being an Oliver Stone production I guess other felt this film should have had more depth due to him being the Director however my opinion was that maybe Stone for once didn't want to push the whole ""message"" thing he normally does and instead focused more on entertainment with the flamboyant actors who did fit with what I believe this film tried to project.

On the negative side however I wish they did add to the backstory of Cameron Diaz' character as I feel her role left questions unanswered and more about her character was needed to make sense of her actions. If you pay attention to the subtle background conversations and chatter you'll discover Cameron's character was making some bad calls like losing 3 draft picks for unknown reasons and her secret deal to move the franchise as well as the financial issues of needing a new stadium. Had these things been more thoroughly explained, Cameron Diaz would not have been outshined by LL and LT as an actor as she was in this film. LT for example had a simpler role in this film but outshined Cameron Diaz solely because his character fit him better.

Overall this was a very entertaining film and could be enjoyed provided you accept these weaknesses in the plot and instead enjoy the film for what I believe it's intention was; to be a fast paced action movie with subtle life lessons mixed in. Also, I wouldn't suggest this film for young children as some of the adult content may be disturbing. If not taken seriously, it's a fun film.",1212969600,,1649,4.5675675675675675

1370128,1,B00004Y2R4,"It's hard to know where to start with this movie.  Should one begin by saying, ""Poor Al Pacino""?  Or ""Poor Oliver Stone""? ... Two talents, notably wasted.

Let's start with Al, a paisan. ...

Where have you gone, Al Pacino?  A nation turns its lonely eyes to your lonely eyes.  Was it in ""And Justice For All"" that you started *lecturing* us?  There you are, holding forth on this, that or the other.  But this isn't acting, Al baby, it's pontificating.

That might not be so bad if ""Any Given Sunday"" has something to say.  It doesn't.  It's an empty, cynical, mean-spirited film.

Stone, as director, co-writer and bit actor in the movie, wants it both ways.  On one hand, he hauls out every clich, every truism, every shallow intellectually-impoverished ""insight"" about football -- that it uses up bodies and spirits -- that it represent corporatism-gone-wild
-- that it's no longer anything near a ""game"" but instead a ruthless, soulless business.  All of which Stone, as director/writer pontificates about via his actors.

At the same time, he wants it the *other* way, too.  That is to say, he takes every opportunity to show us the blood-lust of professional football -- the spectacular hits, the macho strutting, the caveman sexuality.  In short, all the worst aspects of human nature.

Come on, Ollie, make-up-yer-mind!  You can't have it both ways, boychick.

It's not that there aren't talented people involved in this movie.  Like so many other pieces of Hollywood crap, there is a great deal of talent in front of and behind the camera.  But to what end?  To say what?

Here's Oliver Stone making ""JFK"" in which he postulates that JFK was bumped off by, among others, the military-industrial complex.  Ok, fine, that being the case, then why doesn't he offer us in ""On Any Given Sunday,"" any meaningful, insightful, first-order connection between football and the brutality of American militarism; football and the corporatization of America; football and ""The American way of life.""  Any attempts to do this in the movie are embarrassingly weak and sophomoric.

Consider Oliver Stone's ""take"" on 9-11; the ridiculous movie he made about the heroes of 9-11.  Say, Oliver, think there might be just a *tad* of evidence that 9-1l was perhaps ""allowed to happen"" -- or worse?  That there is, in fact, a truckload of information, evidence and ""background context"" that's been systematically ignored by the Establishment, and that maybe a talented filmmaker such as yourself can shed some light on. ... But wait a second, there I go mistaking you for someone other than a status quo-defending Establishment mainstay.

Getting back to ""On Any Given Sunmday,"" the funniest part of the movie, albeit completley unintentional, is the quick-cut, still-photo reference to Al Pacino's character as a quarterback star in days-gone-by.  Oh, please, Lord have mercy!  (And, please note: I'm an agnostic.)  Al Pacino as a quarterback?!

I'm old enough to remember when some quarterbacks were short, e.g., Eddie LaBaron and Bobby Layne in the 1950s, but please: Al Pacino as a quarterback?  He'd have to bring a ladder to the line of scrimmage every time he threw a pass.

As previously noted, the movie is packed with talented craftsman, Stone and Pacino included among them.  But what are they toiling at?  Answer: A pretentious piece of violent, frenzied, cynical, intellectually-addled nonsense.  (And those are the *good* parts of the movie!  Ba-da-bing-bing!)

Cameron Diaz is talented enough to be in quality movies.  An occurence that's yet to happen.

Even if all the movie aspires to be is ""entertaining,"" it's a flop.  It's totally ridiculous on the face of it.  The only entertainment value it can have is for the audience to laugh out loud at its shallowness and pomposity.

Enough, Oliver, with these nanosecond, wink-of-an-eye, hyperactive montage cuts.  You're a grown man, now, Oliver; rapid eye movement syndrome is not for you.  (Or us.)

Question: You went so fast with all the nanosecond quick-cuts, Oliver, I couldn't keep up -- was that Lee Harvey Oswald on the sidelines schtupping Caeron Diaz?  (Oh, the humanity!)

Sports movies are always difficult to pull off, especially football movies.  In fact, maybe the only quality football movie ever released was ""North Dallas Forty,"" starring Nick Nolte.  Better yet, know what,"" read the book by the same name.  Although after you watch ""On Any Given Sunday"" you may want to give your eyeballs six months to calm down and return to normal.

In short, next time let the camera *linger* a bit, Oliver.  Breath deeply, take a tranquilizer, study the way Vittorio DeSica used his camera.  Just calm down, Oliver, just calm down.

And, Al.  Poor Al Pacino, my paisan, my cumpare.  How did it comes to this?  I want all inquiries made.  I want no acts of vengeance.  These goofy, nonsensical movies you're making, one after another after another, ALL THIS MUST END!  Kabish?

And don't say: ""Can't do it, Sally,"" because we all know you can.  You're just a little confused now.  Take a lap ... and lose the Joe Namath posters.",1192492800,2,5088,4.950236966824645
1370129,2,B00004Y2R4,"This movie has all the right pieces - memorable characters, hard-hitting action, a bit of philosophy and wisdom. But unfortunately, the bits just don't add up.

For some reason, it seems like the movie should've been able to thrive on just a few of these elements alone: Al Pacino and Camron Diaz play very memorable characters. Al Pacino is an old rugged loud-mouthed football coach, while Camron Diaz, the new team-owner, is a young and stylish, forward-looking businesswoman. The two actors are great, and when they're both on-screen, they have a sort of dissonance that has the potential to drive a great film. Their characters are further mirrored in the football team's old-timer and rookie stars. The old and the new are contrasted throughout the film, constantly shifting as the characters develop and the plot thickens. Add some intense football action, and how could you possibly go wrong?

Well, apparently you can go wrong. The film's pace is clunky and inconsistent. The football scenes are shot and edited with the sort of intensity that you might see in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan when they're invading the beach. However, these scenes just never end, it's as if Stone is simply trying to top previous sports films by pushing the envelope just a bit more - more sound, crunching, blood, yelling, aching, quick cuts, claustrophobic close-ups. He even goes so far as to use tiger growls for the athletes' grunts, and to make the injuries just all the more gory. After a while it's simply a mess - like listening to heavy metal for hours, it might be heavy stuff, but eventually it all starts sounding the same.

In the end, the movie doesn't even really capture the excitement of football. I mean, he has animal noises coming out of players' mouths for godsake. Every now and then, a scene will address the strategy of the game. But overall, you never really see what makes Al Pacino such a great coach.

And this is why the movie never quite holds together. It's more concerned with the hyper-realism of its football games than with its character development. Ultimately, the style is innovative, but movies don't thrive on just style alone - it has to serve a larger purpose. The pacing is simply lousy; it's as if the speed of plot development in Any Given Sunday is inversely proportional to the speed of the camera-shots on the football field.

Overall the film simply has no vibe. Between the hyper-realism of the football scenes and the slow and pensive pace, the movie takes itself so seriously that you'd think you were watching a war-movie. But this is not from the characters being too devoted to the game; it's a result of poor choices when it came to screenwriting and editing.",1189814400,2,2715,4.817596566523605

1370142,5,B00004Y2R4,"Any Given Sunday is about the Miami Sharks football team and their struggle to make it to the top. The team is owned by Cameron Diaz, in quite possibly her fiercest role, as she takes no prisoners and is just as willing to hit her players as hire them. The coach is Al Pacino in a stereotypical Pacino role complete with scratchy voice, alcoholic tendencies, and volatile temper. Dennis Quaid plays the first-string quarterback who has spearheaded the team through so many good seasons that, even though he's injury plagued like Humpty Dumpty the team just keeps putting him back together again. When he's injured at the beginning of the season, the Sharks call out their second-string quarterback who is immediately injured too, and then they go to the bench for Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). Beamen is so used to warming the bench that he barely knows the plays they're calling and he gets nauseated the first time he steps on the field. Still, after a few games he finds his stride and becomes the team's golden boy--nausea or no. Eventually he gets a bit big for his britches and starts talking down the defense, putting more powder up his nose than on it, and thinking that he doesn't have to listen to the coach, which Pacino hates of course.

Any Given Sunday is fast-paced, hectic, and dramatic in the way that only Oliver Stone could make it. Cameron Diaz is my favorite character because she's so incredibly fierce that I can't believe she gets away with treating the people she does without any consequences. Jamie Foxx is perfect as the arrogant, cocky quarterback who of course can't be bothered to remember his humble days as a benchwarmer. One of the most hilarious moments of the film involves a commercial he films for MetRx complete with his own song, ""My name is Willie (Beamen),"" make sure to look out for it. Some of the supporting players include Lawrence Taylor as a defensive player who's been hit a few too many times, Ann-Margret as Diaz's liquored-up mother, and Lauren Holly as the first string quarterback's trophy wife who refuses to let her husband go down as a has-been. Overall, the cast is stellar and the direction is superb.

Not only on the field it's extreme but off it as well which Oiver Stone touches upon quite realistically.

There is also a second disc which has deleted scenes which were sadly left out of the movie,but luckily recovered and unedited a good addition.

  ANY GIVEN SUNDAY

One of my favorite scenes ever,and a speech that moves me every time I hear it. Oliver Stone's big,loud and undeniably flawed football epic may be dismissed as a shallow celebration of masculinity. However,look closer at an ambitious exploration of pride,greed and passion. Oliver Stone may require an aquired taste,and he certainly doesnt seem to let some moments speak for themselves,but like he said himself
  ""they say im unsubtle,
  but above all we  need theatre that wakes us up,
  nerves and heart""
Backed up by incredible photographic imagery,cinematography,and a thumping soundtrack accompanying the chaotic and war-like football scenes,Any Given Sunday certainly makes an impression,nomatter what way you look at it.
Defiently a must for Al Pacino and Oliver Stone fans,whose similiarly over the top and manic ways of expressing themselves blend like a fiery dream. Jamie Foxx also stars in his first great performance as a 'serious' actor.",1130284800,,1395,5.123893805309734
1370146,4,B00004Y2R4,"As my title indicates, I'm not the biggest football fan; however, I found Oliver Stone's film to be totally engrossing, due mostly to the outstanding performances from all involved. That, along with the movie's entertaining musical soundtrack, makes this film a must-see for all.

In regards to the acting, ""Any Given Sunday"" shows a variety of talent, experience, along with stars-in-the-making. Jamie Foxx is an example of the latter. His performance as brash, young, third-string-quarterback ""Willie Beaman"", brought into the limelight after injuries sustained by veteran Dennis Quaid, is the perfect showcase for the actor's emerging skills. It is no wonder that Foxx won an Oscar this year and he deserved a nomination for AGS.

Cameron Diaz, as the general manager of the fictional Miami Sharks, is quite good as a woman in charge of a male-dominated position. She holds her own with the more seasoned performers that populate this dynamic film.

Quaid gives another underrated performance as the washed-up quarterback with one more good game to play. James Woods, one of the best character actors today, delivers another flawless job as the seedy team doctor. Matthew Modine, L.L. Cool J, and Aaron Eckhart match him in other supporting roles.

Though her role is small, Lauren Holly gets some points for her performance as Quaid's supportive and determined wife.

Actor/songwriter Clifton Davis (one of the stars of the 80's sitcom ""Amen"" and composer of The Jackson Five's ""Never Can Say Goodbye"") has a moment in the sun as the mayor of Miami.

Football legends Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor are effective in their roles of assistant coach and veteran linesman, respectively.

Smaller roles are assayed by legends Ann-Margret (cast as Diaz's mother and widow of the team's former owner) and Charlton Heston as the football commissioner. As a tribute to the actor, as well as providing a fitting comparison between football's modern-day gladiators to those of ancient times, a montage of scenes from ""Ben-Hur"" are intertwined between events unfolding in the film's story.

But the movie belongs to Al Pacino, an actor of unparalleled talent that immerses himself in the role of the ""old school"" coach that must make deal with a changing sports world and the traditions that he holds so dearly. When his ""Tony D'Amato"" cries, so does the audience. When he is frustrated at the team's loss, the audience feels that frustration. When he experiences joy, that feeling is shared by all.

If Stone hadn't had such a mixed track record of hits and misses, an Oscar might be on Pacino's shelf, for he surely deserved one for this film.",1126396800,3,2636,5.069284064665127

You didn't really see him as a coach character, but as ""Al Pacino.""

1370149,3,B00004Y2R4,"This is a story about wannabe champions, who lose more than they win.  There is constant conflict on the field and in the locker room.  The quarterback, Willie Beaman, played by a comedian was non-descript at first, hardly legible as he did not know how to play a straight role.  He was told that the quarterback is always the star, but he wanted to make his own plays in the huddle instead of what the coach ordered.  Willie is constantly feuding with his coach and just about everyone else.

Shakespeare wrote in his play, 'Julius Caesar,' ""Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once.""  Now, that he has a taste of the good life (he'd been hurt emotionally in college and dropped out), he argued with Vanessa, his live-in 'baby girl' of seven years telling her that he felt inferior to her education.  Actually, he'd been 'taken' with a Nicole-type character and decided he might as well be O.J.  He asked Christina out for a date.

She was more interested in the power plays and conflict with the coach she did not like, Tony (played by Al Pacino).  She felt that this Miami team had belonged to her dead father, and she should call the plays.  ""He wasn't a genius, just thought he was"" she was told.

There is a player (#19) who resembled Frank Gifford and has his own interpersonal problems; guess that was before he hooked up with Cathy Lee.  Blonde Christina in her backless black evening frock looked like dark-haired Belinda at KAT, and sounded as false.

Here I am watching football, and I don't like football!  In high school, I saw maybe two of those Cecil played as the extra-point kicker/left end. And I had a big crush on Jim Darling, a member of that team at Central High. Then Zach (#13 like Willie) played in junior high and one year in high school and was a minor star.  Justin was the quarterback for his non-league team.  So, there are sports in my family.  Jeff's 'sport' was as a lifesaver at the local public swimming pool.

Willie progressed, even though he still had low self-esteem, onto the covers of 'Sports Illustrated' and 'ESPN' magazines.  The touchdown by #89 was spectacular. and the red flag on the field added interest. The cheerleaders were par for the course.  At the swimming pool party, the ""Poster Boy"" was called to his task for his attitude.  He was told he was not a team player and ""you must sacrifice"" so they could heal as a team.  He was told he had intercranial bleeding in the head.  Wish mine was there instead of the liver and maybe I would have a chance to live longer.

At the press conference, Coach Tony admitted he had over reacted.  ""When you get old in life, margin or error is so small; every second counts.  It makes all the difference between winning and losing, living and dying.""  At the big dance affair, the music was well chosen: 'That's The Way I Like It' and 'Dancing Cheek to Cheek.'  This was a good movie for its time and well-directed by Oliver Stone.",1123977600,,2968,4.5159474671669795
1370150,5,B00004Y2R4,"Once more Apollo and Dionysus face one each other. Apollo is the supreme master of the rules, the establishment, a fervent follower of the pre established codes. Dionysus is an outlaw, he simply fights for its aim and no matter how he will follow his instincts.

Apollo means the experience the hidden wisdom beyond the scares and wrinkles. Dionysus is the youth who in its own rapture thinks to itself it is eternal, it is the innocence captivated by its goals, no reflection just action. The heroes are essentially sculpted by Dionysian. And that explains his presence in the Earth is so brief. They don't know the fear and his life is just a play.  The prudence doesn't exist in his particular dictionary and even in his thinking.  Think in Siegfried ` s the hero per excellence in Wagner's Ring.

The real confrontation is exhibited out of the battle field when the Sharks ` team has lost four games in a row, and Cap, one of the artifice player is seriously wounded in the Third game.

""In this game you have got to be about some more than win"", says Tony D' Amato to the raising young promise of the Sharks, Beahme. And the insights about this hard sport are treated with that vertiginous rhythm so typical of Stone. The medical ethic is carved in relief between a brief but intense dialogue between Mathew Modine and James Woods.

The film is a real punch who goes far beyond the simple entertainment for teenagers, surpassing the anecdote to become in a real cult movie of recent times.

The mesmerizing performance of Jammie Fox proved his recent Award was not a mere product of the coincidence. Dennis Quaid is perfect as Cap and Cameron Diaz is simply arresting as the one sight heiress and widow of this team, legacy of her father.

1370162,3,B00004Y2R4,"Are you suffering from the annual bout of post-Super Bowl depression (PSBD)?  Is this Sunday, the first since the end of the NFL season, leaving you feeling lost, already looking ahead to September so you can resume watching a collection of pumped-up, tattoed freaks of nature perform astounding feats of physical prowess?  Are you terrified at the thought of having to spend Sundays reading, going outside, or spending quality time with loved ones?  Well, if you are, you could do a lot worse than to postpone the onset of PSBD by reclining in your favorite easy chair and watching Any Given Sunday.

Any Given Sunday has a lot to recommend it.  It's got a sweet Hollywood budget, a cast loaded to the brim with talent (and no sign of Keanu Reeves, thankfully; I'm still having nightmares from the time I watched the Replacements), and the direction of the one and only Oliver Stone.  In following the turbulent last quarter of a season in the life of the (fictional) Miami Sharks of the (fictional) AFFA, the movie combines an operatic scope with an almost fanatical attention to detail and loads of heavy philosophy for a film whose best moments (whether on the field or not) are as hard-hitting as anything you'll see in a real game.  Sure, the movie trots out an endless series of hackneyed plot devices and stock characters, but Stone manages to breathe life into all of them.

A no-holds-barred if sensationalistic examination of professional football both on and off the field, Any Given Sunday is both believable and completely ridiculous at the same time, a monument to excess that is in itself wildly excessive.  It starts punishing your senses right away, with two quarterbacks suffering catastrophic injuries and a third throwing up before taking his first snap, and it doesn't relax much from there on out, either in its torrid pace or in its commitment to full sensory assault.  Indeed, this may be the fastest two-and-a-half-hour movie ever made.  Like an all-out blitz up the middle, it comes at you relentlessly, and also like an all-out blitz, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  At times it seems as though Stone just tried to take the themes and conflicts that made Platoon such an artistic triumph and graft them onto a football movie.  The movie goes for an outsized, epic feel at almost all times, with varying degrees of success.

At turns frenetic and painfully slow, Stone's camerawork makes for perhaps the best cinematic representation yet of the intensity and ferocity of pro football, and the movie's grasp of the game's strategical minutiae is a sign of a director who's done his homework.  Regrettably, Stone's emphasis on brutal hits and flashy shots also takes something away from the inherent sophistication of the pro game, making it look like little more than the product of excessive testosterone levels.  Of course, what happens on the field is only part of the story, as Stone makes sure to present the viewer with look at all the sordid goings-on that occur behind the scenes.  It's here that the movie really throws everything but the kitchen sink at you, politely ensuring that boredom doesn't set in between game scenes.  You've got fights; rampant substance abuse; players fornicating left and right; a mammoth SUV getting sawed in half; scads of gratuitous nudity; guys playing when they shouldn't even be trying to walk and chew gum and the same time; and lots of hot women acting extremely catty.  And that's just a short list.

Alright, I've somehow managed to fill up four paragraphs with this review, so it's time to cut things off here.

Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz all very good and fitting in their roles, I didn't foster a big attachment to Dennis Quaid's character, but he was still good. The speach Al Pacino makes in the locker room ""inch by inch"" was very moving and adds tremendous feeling that the characters individually are all feeling at that time. I recommend this movie.

""Any Given Sunday"", dollar for dollar, however, should really take first place, everything else equal.  Until this production, there had never been a movie with more cliches than actual words of dialogue. Having covered the NFL for more than two decades, I can assure you and Oliver Stone that Al Pacino's conflicted coach would not have had that ""need a dozen fewer prunes at lunch"" look if he were indeed leading a team into the playoffs.  His next stop, after the heartless, greedy owner got through with him, would have been to another team offering more money.

  Jamie Foxx, with his primadonna quarterback antics, might look compelling on celluloid, but in a real NFL locker room, he would have wound up with a large foreign object stuffed in his ""gem protector"".  Mr. Stone placed himself on-screen in the announcing booth and was shown actually rooting for Big Al's squad.  This might play in high school, but it's unrealistic and unprofessional in the big-time.

  Finally, grunting and groaning actually does occur during a game.  But the linemen don't lose two quarts of bodily fluid on every pass-blocking episode, and, quite frankly, nobody ever  needs to see Gatorade residue that up close again  Oliver Stone shot these sequences so tightly that we lost perspective.  Even the television networks, known to hype and grind anything remotely interesting into the dust, understand that slo-motion is best used sparingly.  Three or four instances of this cinema technique would have been sufficient.  But to turn a fast-paced sport into a gladiator movie with valium-induced choreography helped made this film only slightly preferable to a visit to the dentist.

1370167,4,B00004Y2R4,"I think this may actually be my favorite Oliver Stone movie. Other movies he's done have greater scattered moments throughout, but I always wind up feeling that his pounding/bigger-than-life/quick-cut/Oliver Stone-y way of making movies is so ham-fisted that he ends up diminishing the impact of what he's trying to say. In ""JFK"" or ""Nixon"" or ""Natural Born Killers,"" every single moment is so HUGE and POWERFUL and SIGNIFICANT that, after a while, it becomes ridiculous.

""Any Given Sunday,"" however, is a football movie. The constant POUNDING and EPIC MUSIC and SLOW MOTION and INTENSITY actually makes sense, here. He's not talking about things that require subtlety. He's talking about football.

Not a ""brilliant"" movie, it's true, but certainly a good one. Lots of great performances, pounding rain, grunting, growling, smashing into each other... with a fair bit of thematic content tossed in as well.

Good stuff.",1102118400,,921,5.294520547945205
1370168,4,B00004Y2R4,"At first, I didn't know what to think.  ""Oliver Stone doing a football movie?""  It's been so long since he did anything that WASN'T affiliated to a political line that I don't know if he did one.  Stone had to base the togetherness of the football team characters with something in his own past, and I'm betting the time he spent in the military helped: the military teaches a large amount of togetherness and teamwork I never knew until I entered into it myself.

The movie applies the Stone Technique, meaning hyperactive, music video camerawork and plot grit.  This movie would appear the most honest in comment about the American NFL sport and the people who play it.  This film actually has a plot, and it's carried out in detail.  This film is actually about something.  The characters are as large as Roman titans, and very sexy.  If you like pro football, you probably already saw this movie, as all of my Army buddies that like football have.  Myself, I really don't watch sports, but I thought this was a good movie and worth the money.  As I said, I don't know of a more honest football film.  This is definitely not a kids movie!  It follows a general line of past football films, but the Stone Treatment of the issue makes each player on the football field a titan, like Spartacus or Maximus from ""Gladiator"".  This film is the Mount Everest of ""teamwork movies"".

The camerawork is really good.  Watching the movie, you'd think you're looking at ""Sports Illustrated"" magazine photos in motion.  I also enjoyed the montages, reminding me of John Frankenheimer's ""Grand Prix"" Cinerama spectacle.

The cast is superb!  Jamie Foxx obliterates this role, as he did in his supporting role for ""Ali"", and one can see where he's going as an actor leading up to his recent roles in ""Collateral"" and ""Ray"", the Ray Charles movie; Oscar quality.  Al Pacino is another phenomenon in this movie, and he has one of the best climactic speeches I've seen in some time.  Dennis Quaid is good as a Dan Marino-type famous and aged quarterback, and James Woods and Cameron Diaz are really good.  I didn't expect Diaz to do as good a job.  Even LL Cool J was good.  Stone, of course, plays a cameo role as a sportscaster.",1101168000,,2214,4.603580562659847
1370169,4,B00004Y2R4,"""Any Given Sunday, you can win or you can lose - but can you lose like a man?"" - Oliver Stone didn't exactly win with this one, but in my mind, its a solid movie. most of the complaints against this movie are that it is too long (partially true) and that it has NO plot (totally untrue).

the movie is about team-play, ambition, ego-struggles and competition in general. Oliver Stone has penned a brilliant script and woven a tight and subtle story here for the discerning audience. the viewer will have to carefully observe the subtle interplay between various people to really appreciate what is going on in their minds and how each person changes as the movie progresses. this is what the whole plot is about and since its not exactly very obvious, the movie is lost on many.

however, the acting is still brilliant (even cameron diaz). the editing is just top-rate, the quick cuts and sharp angles to capture the excitement on the field is just terrific, but it might be a bit of an eye-sore for people who prefer the safe soft, long & slow shots. another outstanding highlight is the music, very very apt and and adding to the mood in each scene.

But why make a point once when you can make it forty seven times? It only takes three hours, plus you can toss in liberal drones of waffling yet verbose dialogue. Why, we may even shoot the plays from so up, close and personal that the audience cannot for the life of it figure out the dozen time warps between scoreboards.

Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J  do the occasional serious turn, Dennis Quaid grimaces like only he can (in natural agony, an emotion the audience effortlessly echoes) and Cameron Diaz bursts a windpipe to be the shrieking pseudo-toughguy. Pacino follows a similar routine to deliver the famous speech towards the tail-end, by when most of us are comfortably asleep.

Perhaps a tolerable watch for diehard fans of the game, but the only football that gets bobbed about in this blur of color is the audience.",1094774400,4,1046,4.6378378378378375
1370181,4,B00004Y2R4,"It's too easy to take pot shots at Oliver Stone, his filmmaking style, his excessive use of . . . well, pretty much everything. Criticisms of Stone's clich's pretty much have become the realm of clich themselves.

 I've read a number of reviews by ""sports fans"" who hate this movie because they are ""sports fans."" I'm not buying it. I'm a sports fan (a fairly rabid one at that) and I loved this film, warts and all. Complaints of perceived non-linear storytelling don't matter to me in this type of movie. It's ALL about the Crash Boom! Anyone who's played professional sports (most of all NFL) will tell you the game today does closely resemble a video war game. From the initial drafting to the big business, high expectations, marketing frenzy and ownership/management chaos to player conceits, familial expectations, and tribulations both marital and extra marital, Stone's movie doesn't flinch. Climb on board, and you find yourself on an unrelenting, entertaining, frustrating, and ultimately exhilarating roller coaster ride that you'll disembark from with a wink and a smile.

 I'm not always (or often) a fan of Oliver Stone - but here, his chaotic, frenzied style, slamming camera angles, use of loud, percussive music and rap feel like life itself: fast, dangerous, sometimes predictable but often off kilter. His style serves a vision of the All American game as few others before him have. He here captures the feeling of the ""business"" of football with ferocious artistic integrity and vision, if not necessarily with the accuracy some fan's may wish. Frankly, I don't care for accuracy either historical or technical in film, my only demand is ""entertain me.""

 Any Given Sunday entertains and that's what I expect most from a movie.",1091750400,3,1749,5.0137931034482754
1370182,3,B00004Y2R4,"In Oliver Stone's 1999 release, Any Given Sunday, the audience attempts to follow the fumbles and follies of the fictitious Miami Sharks Pro-football team. Cameron Diaz acts as the owner of the dilapidated Shark franchise, a graduate of Cornell University, and daughter of the original owner of the Sharks. Her father, played by actor Charlton Heston, had a relationship with the head coach D'Amato, played by Al Pacino, where they negotiated contracts by ""having a beer and shaking hands"". Heston's influential cameos in the film led Stone to compare the game of football with Greek gladiators by inserting clips of Ben Hur into the film. Within the first ten minutes you see the fumbling Sharks go through their first and second string quarterbacks, leaving third string quarterback, Jamie Foxx, fumbling for his helmet while trying to remove himself from the bench. At this time the audience sees the beginning of the athletic trainer's true colors, played by James Woods, as he instructs his associates not to touch any of the injured athletes until he gets to the training room. It is there where you understand that he, along with Diaz, and Foxx, will somehow try to manage to throw the remainder of the Shark's season out of bounds.

 Although much of the film is injected, much like a chicken on a poultry farm, with booming Rap music, clips of LL Cool J, and fictitious commercials to break up the monotony of the nearly three hour movie, the film somehow manages to have a flow. It flows right into the major theme of what to do with an aging star quarterback, plagued with multiple injuries, played by Dennis Quaid and accompanied by his wife played by Lauren Holly, and an up and coming hot rod that needs to get his licks before he tears the remaining pieces of the franchise apart. If Stone were to remove some of the unnecessary footage of a vomiting, arrogant, up and coming quarterback, played by Foxx, the movie could be cut almost in half, therefor helping the film to achieve some sort of theatrical award or nomination.

 All in all, if the viewer can overlook some unessential nudity, graphic language, vial drug use, and violence that is not usually associated even with the game of football, the viewer might enjoy this film. Along with the thought that they manage to stay with the film between all the out takes and multiple conflicts between characters. This film is definitely for a more masculine audience, as women seem to take the back seat and are viewed only as ""trophies"".",1091059200,2,2506,4.793981481481482
1370183,4,B00004Y2R4,"I'm not a football fan. In fact all I know about the game is that there is a ball that must be moved from one end of a rectangular field to the other. Stone decided to draw parallels between this modern game and the gladiators in Ancient Rome. The suggestions were anything but subtle, what with the grunting, clashing sounds, the numerous shots of Ben Hur and the actual references in the film you couldn't help but notice.
Although this movie is ostensibly about football, I came away from it learning a bit more about life. The movie is about an old coach (Al Pacino) whose love of the game has blinded him to life's real pleasures, an injured QB (Quaid) who is easily manipulated by others to continue playing even if it is detrimental to his health. The daughter (Diaz) of a dead football `baron', who seeks to fulfill her father's lost hope for a son, and a rising star (Foxx) who is blind to everything but his own gratification. From these cast of characters Stone creates drama.
This movie is exciting even for those, like me, who aren't too interested in football. The game scenes seem more like gladiatorial battles than actual football games, and you are left wondering if we have really changed from those Romans thousands of years ago, the way `we' love these slugfests.
As some earlier reviewers mentioned, Stone appears to be slightly biased in his portrayal of the management of these teams. They are definitely out to make money, but I doubt they are as ruthless as they were made out to be. He should have had some perspective in this movie so as not to make it seem like the management were the `baddies' and the players hapless pawns.
Overall, this was a great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes drama. For those with kids, you might want to watch it beforehand as it has some sexual scenes, nudity and quite a lot of obscene language.",1089072000,2,1865,4.553571428571429
1370184,5,B00004Y2R4,"Among Oliver Stone's work includes ""Any Given Sunday"" (1999), as good and realistic a sports movie as has ever been made. It features an over-the-top performance by Al Pacino as a veteran pro football coach who can still motivate his over-paid, over-sexed, over-drugged, slightly thuggish, mostly black (except for a few White Aryan Brotherhood linemen) mercenaries with a speech that sends Knute Rockne to the bench.
He reportedly is working on the story of the 1934 Republican industrialists who recruited Marine hero Smedley Butler to overthrow Franklin Roosevelt, which was the genesis of ""Seven Days in May"". We are still waiting for Tinsel Town to take on Kennedy stealing the 1960 election. It could be a long wait.

1370185,2,B00004Y2R4,"Maybe after coming off the Super bowl high of watching Tom Brady and the Patriots win for the second time in three years I was expecting more from ""Any Given Sunday."" Everything seemed to line up - the cast, with Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid and James Woods; the director and writer Oliver Stone; the concept, a behind the scenes look at the NFL under the fictional guise of the American Football Association. Unfortunately, all these promising pieces added up to a nothing more than every sports clich in the past thirty years of filmmaking crammed into one movie.
The story is really Pacino's, as the aging Coach of the Miami Sharks (clever twist in the Dolphins, huh?) facing the challenges of a changing league. His owner has recently died, leaving the unbelievably obnoxious Diaz as the current Owner, always breathing down his neck and forcing her uninformed will upon him. Owner is concerned with television ratings, possibly moving the franchise - tons of other motives other than winning games. Coach is also trying to manage Foxx as the Young Hot Shot. Young Hot Shot has recently come on the scene when the Old Star (Quaid) was injured. Coach and Old Star are of course very close and belong to the same philosophy, but Young Hot Shot is taking over the game with every play, ignoring Coach's plays and doing his own play-calling - but succeeding. So Coach has a dilemma - when the playoffs start does he go with Young Hot Shot, who the cameras (and Owner) love, or with the tried and true methods of Old Star?
Well, Young Hot Shot has isolated himself from the rest of the team with his brash comments and rise to a household name (in all of about three games). So Coach goes with the unconfident Old Star in the first game of the playoffs. But all the while Young Hot Shot has been learning his lesson, quietly nodding in understanding during Coach's rousing halftime speeches. So when the time comes and Old Star is again injured, Young Hot Shot is ready to step in. By this time, though, Coach has accepted Young Hot Shot's unruly methods and allows him to just go for it, and they of course, win the game.
Sound familiar? It should. It's the plot of about every sports film ever made. We don't even need actual names to describe it. I expected so much more from Stone. In an attempt to show what pro sports is  ""really"" like, he apparently thought the story wouldn't matter. We focus on almost everything but football - the egos of the characters, the ulterior motives of the owner, the inaccurate news reporting - but not football. The games are reduced to darkened, rainy war scenes, with people loosing eyes (literally), front flips over defenders, and someone getting injured on almost every play.
Whether or not football is actually the way Stone depicts it, he did not paint a convincing picture whatsoever. Essentially, the owner cares *nothing* for the players, the coaches clear players to play when they are one hit away from having an aneurism, and the players intentionally don't block on the front line because they don't like their quarterback. Sorry. I don't buy it. Stone paints the league as a dark, depressing, unforgiving torture chamber, with games no more sophisticated than a fourth-grade scramble in the park. Football is the most complex game on the planet - why not show even a little bit of that? Instead of the Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots - who chose to have themselves introduced as a team rather than individuals - we get the tough to swallow Miami Sharks, who all *hate* each other. A team like this would never make the playoffs - never. And then, to make it even worse, all of this is thrown together in a horrendous MTV-style montage. The movie is edited like a commercial - it just feels like a collection of scenes, not a movie.
I do not recommend this film, especially if you love football and are hoping for a good sports movie. It's a war film in the costume of a sports film, and apparently Stone doesn't think the audience is intelligent enough to understand this for themselves, because he includes scene after scene of gladiators fighting in the coliseum, ramming the analogy down the viewer's throat. He should stick to the war/crime movies, and stop trying to impose the genre on innocent films.",1076198400,2,4291,4.683443708609271

I thought the action was amazing...I'm a football fan and I enjoyed the hits, the sounds, the views from the players....I enjoyed it all.
I hear lots of people complaining about how long the film was...well I guess that shows how much I enjoyed it because I never noticed that it was any longer than any other film because I was into it from beginning to end.
I thought that Jamie Foxx gave a wonderful and believable performance in his role as Willie Beamon. Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz and Lauren Holly (as usual) did not disappoint. LL Cool J looked like he fit right in with the rest of the cast and I enjoyed the antics of so many of the other characters. LT Taylors performance was great and I had no clue Bill Bellamy had any athletic skills. As a sports fan I especially enjoyed trying to pick out current and former NFL athletes and coaches throughout the film.
Needless to say...I found every aspect of the film enjoyable and I have watched it over and over again.

How do you rate a movie based on its length? How does that affect the acting and the intense screenplay and perfectly written script. Despite the length, I have watched this movie nearly 20 times and not once did I have a second thought on how much I loved it. The plot is a prefect example of the struggles that the modern day NFL goes through. Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J, James Woods, Cameron Diaz, and the legendary Al Pacino all star in this movie and do an excellent job. I think Oliver Stone is one of the best Directors/Producers out there, I mean first Scarface now this? I can't wait to see what's next!
The football Scenes in this movie are breathtaking. It's damn crazy when you see how far into the play they really go. Watch the movie and you will see what Im talking about. Just watch how real these hits are. It's 100% real.
In general, with the huge cast of stars, the great filming style, and the feeling you get of being inside the plays after watching one of the awesome games, this movie gets a 5 stars. In fact I give it 6. And to add on to that, the special features in this film are awesome. Buy this DVD, you will not regret it, no matter how long the movie is.",1073088000,2,1314,4.1568627450980395

""Any Given Sunday"" was a fair football movie that could have been a great sports film if skillfully edited to a more reasonable 2 hour length. Aside from its bladder busting 157 minute endurance, it was a fairly entertaining study of modern day football not too far removed in attitude and tone from ""North Dallas Forty"". But times as they say are a changing and Stone addressed the new economic realities of creative stadium financing, a new breed of athlete acutely aware of lucrative endorsement possibilities that go hand in hand with success on the gridiron, and Stone played the ""race card"" to some clever advantage. Comedian Jamie Foxx was wonderful in his dramatic turn as a third string quarterback who suddenly finds himself the object of media and public attention as surprise replacement to ""Cap"" Rooney, the injured, aging star of the Miami Sharks, nicely defined by Dennis Quaid. As veteran head coach Tony D'Amato, Al Pacino was given carte blanche to let fly with his signature fiery bombast at times directed to players individually or collectively, the franchise ownership (Cameron Diaz), the team doctor (James Woods) or anyone else who crossed his purposes. The remaining cast was rounded out superbly with a host of wonderful performances including but certainly not limited to Jim Brown, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Charlton Heston as the Commissioner, and Clifton Davis as a shrewd big city mayor.

His tale of a civil war within another male institution is explored here much as it was in PLATOON.
  The DVD quality is one of the best I have seen. The opening half-hour football sequence is bone-crunching, pulse-pounding, and unfolds much like scenes in JFK, DOORS, and NATURAL BORN KILLERS. Try to spot all of the real-life football hereos such as Johnny Unitas, Jim Brown, LT, and Barry Switzer. (THOSE ARE PRETTY EASY TO SPOT SINCE THEY GET A LOT OF SCREEN TIME BUT THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHERS THAT IF YOU BLINKED YOU WOULD MISS THEM).

The sound editing is particularly first rate, enhancing the on screen action immeasurably. The DVD edition is crisp and has many special features.
Essentially this film is a story of a failing football team with an aging coach (Pacino) and an arrogant young quarterback (Foxx, who really has a terrific throwing arm) who struggle to work together, at first failing miserably. Ultimately, they complete the evolution to a true team and find victory in teamwork. The plot is intricate, yet never boring as Pacino struggles for personal redemption and a new start while reigning in Foxx, and Foxx struggles with all authority, most particularly the coaching staff.
An excellent supporting cast rounds out the production, notably Dennis Quaid as an aging quarterback, a one time nemesis of Foxx, and James Woods as a slimy team doctor in a role that only he could execute this flawlessly.
I would have given this film five stars except for some unsightly (full frontal male) nudity, bad language that fails to enhance the plot and a disgusting, dislodged eyeball scene that did nothing to help the movie other than crank up the gore.

The only bright spot is Jamie Foxx, in a role that lets him run around as an egotistical football player.  Even Pacino looks forced, like he's phoning in his lines from Hawaii while CGI artists create a polygon Al for the screen.

Cameron Diaz is horribly miscast...she gets to cuss and act mean, but to what purpose other than to be the character that represents ""young, money-hungry, tradition-despising business people of today."" Lauren Holly...what the heck was that character?!?! And Pacino, who can be good, is allowed to indulge in all his mannerisms, but to no purpose. I kept expecting a line like ""I try to get out of football...but they always pull me back.""
I enjoyed some of the more minor characters a bit more...some of the young football players were really well done. And Dennis Quaid is properly seedy, kinda the ""anti-Rookie."" James Wood was wasted, though.
The scenes of football are noisy and violent, but shot in such close-up that you don't get much sense of the game itself.  It's just not a great sports movie and it's not a great ""statement"" movie.  It's just an average (and overlong) diversion.",1042934400,,1231,5.059113300492611

""North Dallas Forty"" is still the best football movie made to date, but I have to admit I am somewhat surprised that this film was not more impressive.  I would have thought that Oliver Stone filming football plays would be awesome.  But while he does try to give us a sense of how FAST the games in the NFL are played I found myself cringing every time there was a slow motion shot of a pass hanging forever in the air.  The drama of a pass play is seeing it develop, but if all you see is the ball you have no idea of who the ball is being thrown to, how well he is covered, or anything that makes the play exciting.  Stone pulls this gambit several times and it never works once.  The touchdown routines after the scores are choreographed better.  And do not even get me started about the bit with the eye...
Off the playing field every character has their own clich&eacute;.  The whole subplot with Cameron Diaz as the team owner is painful (but no one is wasted more in this film than Ann-Margaret as her mom) and Lawrence Taylor's performance as a toned down version of himself nicknamed the ""Shark"" is negated by the melodramatic waiting question of what will happen if he is hit wrong.  Dennis Quaid tries to bring some poignancy to the final days of a once great quarterback, but unfortunately he has Lauren Holly as a psychotic wife.  The Dallas Knights have the ugliest football uniforms in the history of the known universe, but, hey, isn't that Johnny U. roaming the sidelines as their coach?  That sure is Jim Brown preaching the gospel of defense to his troops.  Then again, I liked Willie Beamon's game ritual (and the way it becomes taken as a sure sign of good things to come); Jamie Fox, ironically enough, ends up being one of the most realistic characters in the film.  Still, when the best scene in the film is coach Al Pacino's pep talk before the big game or the punch line that caps off the end credits, that is not really a great selling point for a football movie.  But at least that scene makes up for all the scenery chewing and maudlin reflections Pacino has to do throughout the rest of the movie.
Oh, and did I mention that the clips from ""Ben-Hur"" keep going out of sequence?  Apparently Charlton Heston did not point that out when he did his cameo as the Commissioner.  But like most of the problems in this film, Oliver Stone covers it by distracting us with music or simply pumping the volume up on the soundtrack.  ""Any Given Sunday"" is disappointing because you look at the talent on both sides of the camera and you really expected just so much more.",1041465600,,2808,4.463796477495108
1370194,3,B00004Y2R4,"There is a thin line between 'great movie' and 'terrible waste of money', and Any Given Sunday manages to walk right on that line.  I could use just about any adjective in the english vocabulary to describe this film, good or bad, and it would probably fit.  It seems like for everything that's good in this film, there's also something that's bad, so it cancels itself out.  For those who've seen the film, what was the deal with the Ann Margaret character?  Was she drunk, or dilusional, or what?  On the other hand, Steamin' Willie Beamen (played perfectly by Jamie Foxx) is one of the better characters ever in a sports flick.  Without Willie Beamen, this film is probably a dud, which is a shame, because it should have been so much better.  Pacino over-acts quite a bit (he's been doing that a lot lately), but it's balanced out by great supporting performances and a stellar soundtrack.  Anyway, being a huge football fan, I liked the movie, but I can't say that it was any better than average.  I can't shake the feeling that this movie would have been better if I had more input.  Being that I'm basically an average joe, that's definitely not a good sign for a Hollywood production.",1040860800,5,1192,4.580188679245283

1370196,5,B00004Y2R4,"Yes, action movie.  Sure, the movie is set in the world of pro football, but it comes off as more of an action flick than a sports show.  It's very hard hitting with a very loud pulse.  Loud, thumping music fills your ears throughout, and the story is full of hard-hitting (pun intended) characters.  A very in your face type of movie.
I love the idea of a football movie taking the role of more of an action movie, as opposed to a football movie.  I think everyone needs a bit of pure action fun every once in a while, and that's what this movie provides.
Of course, that doesn't mean you don't gain some slight care for what happens to the characters as they battle on and off the field.  The aging quarterback trying to hold on to his career and family.  The young quarterback fighting for his newly gained position and with his newly gained fame.  The aging linebacker fighting through injury for that one last paycheck to set his family for life.  The coach, on the downside of his career, fighting tooth and nail with a demanding owner.
What it all boils down to is a very fun movie that I find myself watching time and time again.",1039651200,,1137,4.350710900473934
1370197,3,B00004Y2R4,"Sports movies are tough to make. Creating the essence of the actual event is the toughest. Most films fall short in the editing process of the event or through sheer carelessness and lack of knowledge. ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is somewhat of an exception. It is hard-hitting and bloody like NORTH DALLAS FORTY. It is actually conventional when you think about it, like a warped RUDY. It is a hell of a lot more realistic than say, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS. These are all football films with varying degrees of success (except ROUGHNESS), but Oliver Stone, in his usual over the top way, throws a dizzying, mind-splitting film at us, much like the sport itself. This is why I liked it.
Oliver Stone began a wicked spell of filmmaking with JFK, evident in its editing style. Fast-paced, black and white mixed with color, documentary-like methods ensued in NATURAL BORN KILLERS, NIXON, and the ghastly U-TURN. Nothing is new here with ANY GIVEN SUNDAY. Football is a battlefield Stone chooses to depict and depict it he does. Even the most ardent fans of the sport do not really know what it is like for a quarterback to drop back and get rid of a piece of pigskin before 11 players maul him. You certainly get the idea watching this.
Al Pacino is the dried up head coach of the fictional Miami Sharks and he barks out the usual coaching cliches you hear in press conferences after real games. Pacino also seems to be sleep-walking through the picture. At times, he appears drunk even when he is not supposed to be. Cameron Diaz's character, a young chick owner, (yeah right) destroys any credibility the film may have had going in (Even the NFL would have nothing to do with this movie). Her constant bickering is so over-done, you almost feel like hurling much the way Jamie Foxx does every time he enters a game as the team's 3rd string quarterback. Realisticly speaking, this is not a very sane film about football. It is a maniacal celebration of the game. The scenes on the field are the ones I cherished. Beware of the locker room or domestic sequences.
No one has ever put such energy into football scenes in a film before. He definitely had some good consultants. There are some comical cameos - Johnny Unitas and Dick Butkus play opposing coaches. Lawrence Taylor can actually act a teeny bit and Jim Brown shares the film's best off the field scene with Pacino in a bar. Stone tries to show us how the game has changed. He resonates past glory with quotes from Lombardi, dissolves showing Red ""the Galloping Ghost"" Grange, and even Unitas handing off to Ameche. TV has changed everything, says the coach, and he is right. It seems to be all about the money nowadays.
That is the message, but you'll find yourself losing that idea in the lunacy of ANY GIVEN SUNDAY and the bone-crushing, ear-damaging football scenes. They are filmed and cut with such raw intensity, you feel like playing afterwards. This is definitely a film for football fans only unless you like big, sweaty men. Is there a big game at the end that needs to be won? Yes, and this surprised me considering how unconventional Stone usually is. Basically, surrender your senses and thought process to Stone's most entertaining film in quite some time.",1032912000,,3212,4.686725663716814
1370198,4,B00004Y2R4,"I am not a football fan.  I am not an Oliver Stone fan.  Cameron Diez was woefully miscast.  And still...I really loved this film!
Al Pacino was the original attraction in this film for me.  Suffering through the down-side for the up-side of watching this great actor, who seems at home in any role, seemed do-able.  Pacino didn't disappoint in this film.  He was the personna of his character in all respects.  Nary a mis-step in his performance.
However, I was then pleasantly surprised to enjoy the entire film.  I don't understand why this movie did not do better at the box office, particularly if it was viewed on the big screen, and considering how many football fans there are in the US and how many should have been drawn to this film.  Even to a non-football fan, the game footage was awesome in it's visuals.  The plot, panned apparently by most critics as tired and trite proved interesting.  It presented all facets of the world of Professional Football, which really don't interest me in my real life, but which were fascinating within the story.  The ideas of team-effort, loyalty, old versus new ideas, and reflections on life's choices in the retrospection of middle-age were thought-provoking, but not stodgy or over-dramatized.  The acting of Jamie Foxx was a pleasant surprise, indeed all the actors kept the movie moving and interesting, or perhaps that was the direction of Oliver Stone.  Perhaps in making not his BEST film, he finally made one that even his nonfans could enjoy.
Enjoy it I did!  It deserves a chance in your DVD player if you just want to view a good film with exciting music, great actors, and a complex message presented in a straightforward storyline.",1030924800,,1695,4.776632302405498

I have watched it many times and affirm that it really gets one ""ready for some football"". The story is a collection of mini-stories, all woven into the tapestry of professional football. You will see the good and bad in people, and you will see a team forged from all levels of physical, psychological and emotional combat. Don't be ""drawn offsides"", either. This is not a predictible, sappy sports film - though it has seemingly all the formula for it. Oliver Stone orchestrates a music-video-like, surreal production in which the football action is explosive, crystal clear and totally believable. The ""talking scenes"" are not like the typical film, scenes that you casually wait through to get to the next action sequence. You are drawn into each of the evolving tales, seeing new things every time you watch this movie. Any Given Sunday gets my vote for just the DVD to watch - on any given evening!

1370200,5,B00004Y2R4,"This movie deals about the affairs rounding football. The well-known director Oliver Stone analyses here the activities of Miami Sharks, a fictional American football team. For one reason or another, they are no lucky and get several losses in a row. The situation is so tense inside for everyone: the coach (Al Pacino) who often has to face the actual owner's team (Cameron Diaz). She is angry because of the crisis. There are also the leader of the team (Dennis Quaid) and another ambitious quarterback that tries to get his place (Jamie Foxx). He is Willie Beamen, the star who now appears in front page of all sport magazines.
I enjoyed it so much because of everything: the exceptional cast, the plot, the marvellous direction... and is really spectacular. Stone presents us an amazing work on the camera movements in order to make the games real, and you can see this in the many special features this DVD has. In addition, I liked so the performance by the actors. This goes beyond any movie about sport has ever made.

I`ve seen lots of football movies but I have never seen another movie that shows football and the football players`  life conditions,the way they live,their fears and their wills so truely and pure. So that`s why I think this movie is awesome but still there are little short falls. For example when Jamie Foxx goes to Al Pacino`s house for lunch,they had an argument. While the argument was going on there comes lots of images from gladiator stuff and Al Pacino`s football memories. In a minute you see like hundreds of images that makes you sick. Oliver Stone tried to show the point sharp but while he was doing that he a little bit exaggreatted.

1370226,4,B00004Y2R4,"Loud, raucous, and at times indecipherable, Any Given Sunday is director Oliver Stone's best movie in years. After all, all of Stone's pictures are loud, raucous and at times indecipherable. Off hand, I can think of three kinds of movies that are supposed to be this way - action movies, war movies and football movies. This incisive look at a pro football team undergoing a make or break period is, in my opinion, the best picture about the game ever made.
The movie opens in the middle of a game that is going badly for the Miami Sharks. The team is on a losing streak and really need a win. To make matters worse, star quarterback Jack Rooney [Dennis Quaid] suffers a major back injury. Coach Tony D'Amato [Al Pacino] has no choice but to send in third string quarterback, Willie Beaman [Jamie Foxx], who blows enough plays to cause the team to lose. Up in a posh sky box, owner and general manager Christina Pagniacci [Cameron Diaz] is furious. Christina's deceased father founded the team, and D'Amato has led it to many victorious seasons in his thirty years as coach. This means little to Christina, a ruthless businessperson, whose goal is to sell the franchise. She can't get top dollar for a losing team. There is not an ounce of sentimentality, much less sympathy, in this woman. By the next game, D'Amato has worked his magic on Beaman, who turns out to be a great football player after all. Success soon goes to his head, however, and he becomes an egotistical nightmare for the coach and the team. Rooney is trying to get well enough to return for the playoffs, but in his heart, he knows he's getting too old for the game. Another back injury could land him in a wheelchair permanently.
There is much more to Any Given Sunday's story, but it is the movie's drive and the great acting that make it so good. Nobody can play a man in the twilight of his glory better than Al Pacino. Cameron Diaz is so good as the heartless Christina that she's almost scary. Jamie Foxx gives a career making performance as Willie Beaman, while LL Cool J is first-rate as Julian Washington, a star player who's had one concussion too many.
The film has been criticized for the fast, jumpy edits involving the action on the field, though I really liked them. The idea is not to sit and watch football plays. The idea is to put the viewer on the field with the players, and Oliver Stone achieved this. These scenes are so intense that I came away feeling a bit bruised myself. There have also been complaints that the movie's producers couldn't get the NFL to cooperate. If the NFL had done so, the result would have been as squeak clean as the war movies the Department of Defense used to approved of. What Stone does is to portray the players as modern day gladiators. He also pulls no punches in dealing with the issues of money, fame and the abuse of power and of privilege. His Miami Sharks may not be representative of pro football on the whole, but the team does have problems and issues which often do occur in real life.",1016409600,,3022,4.5063752276867035

James Woods steals the scenes he's in - I hated to see him leave. LT was amazing, especially in the Steamroom scene - almost as good as John Matuszak's outburst at the end of North Dallas Forty. Al Pacino is Al Pacino - I believed him.

1370229,5,B00004Y2R4,"Oliver Stone is a maniac, his movies are stylistic funhouses which showcase just how far one can push film as a stylistic medium.  Any Given Sunday is a fairly mainstream football movie, you have the aging mentor to the arrogant youngster, the coach on his last year and the big game at the end, although it really isn't a big game.  Somehow, it doesn't feel formulaic because Stone and his case invest and bring so much energy to the preceedings.  The NFL scenes are relentlessly outlandish, most say they are unrealistic; So what, if they were realistic you would be watching a regular football game, why would you want to do that.  The cast is uniformly excellent, Al Pacino isn't disappointing as he rarely if ever is.  Cameron Diaz is amazing as the team owner who can more than act head on with Pacino.  Jamie Foxx is very convincing as an arrogant player who begins to reform as the season winds on.  All in all, if you have seen this movie, odds are you knew it was directed by Oliver Stone.  What did you expect, Rudy.  It is stylistic overkill, but it fits the material so it's successful, the only time style overcomes a story is when the story doesn't warrant the style.

1370231,5,B00004Y2R4,"""Any Given Sunday"" keeps the unmistakable style of Oliver Stone, especially seen in Natural Born Killers, transporting it this time in the new, agitated, full of events world of american football.
Al Pacino is the coach of a football team, owned by the greedy Cameron Diaz, team that passes through difficult times, after 4 consecutive defeats and the injury of the best 2 quarterbacks. In this moment enters Beaman (Foxx), the ""always substitute"", and he doesn't miss the unexpected chance awarded by the coach. By his style of play, spectacular, but not caring about the tactics and the schemes, he wins the heart of the fans, but enters in the disgrace of the coach.
The world of football is an eternal source of stories or problems that can be used in a movie. After he showed us wars, from many points of view, the murder of JFK, the agitated history of The Doors, or the satire against the media in Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone enters on an unused territory so far. And he does it in style, with an exceptional movie.
One thing must be clear: this is not a movie only for football fans, but for everybody. Because it's not a movie necessarily about football, but about team spirit, about friendships, joys or troubles, a film with strong characters played by really special actors. A film that will keep your interest at high levels, despite its long runtime, by the fabulous style of Stone, but also by the story, full of events dictated by interests or the rush for money, that many times dims freindships or any bit of morality.
During the movie, you are taken through the backstage of american football. You will discover a dirty world, full of interests and passions, far of the beauty observed from outside. Al Pacino is a character caught between the desire of winning every match no matter what and the friendship that ties him with ""old"" Rooney, who injures himself at the beginning. Beaman is a young football player, selfish, insensitive, but with an extraordinary talent. Many times, the sudden pass from anonymity in the spotlights can bring with it major changes in the character's personality, changes that can only be bad. That's what happends to Beaman. The selfishness, the interest only for himself, bring major misunderstandings between him and his teammates or his coach. Al Pacino has the tough mission of bringing the team to the desired levels, calming down the spirits and also making the difficult decision concerning the quarterback: Beaman or Rooney. New or old. Talent or team player.
Although the script is very good, the film wouldn't have had the same value without Oliver Stone on board. He shows us again, one more time, his great talent. By his awesome way of filming, that reminds us of NBK, the fast paced, incredibly real dialogues, or last, but not least, the full of significance ""inserts"" with what he feasted our eyes and mind also in NBK, you actually feel that you are a part of this world, that you are really inside it. You can't even blink without being sorry. Again, the camera moves very quickly, this agressive style, of fast filming, ""short"" editing, strange angles or permenent camera movement, being a characteristic of many Stone movies. And the ""inserts"" have a special meaning again, especially in the scene of the dialogue between Foxx and Pacino, maybe the best and most significant of the whole movie.
All in all, another success for Oliver Stone. A movie added to his impressive collection of masterpieces, of the most varied and original director of our times.",1006387200,,3533,4.8316831683168315
1370232,3,B00004Y2R4,"You can always count on Oliver Stone to have something interesting to say. In ""Any Given Sunday"", he focuses his lens on the world of pro football and treats us to a dizzying vision of million dollar egos, cortisone shots, and concussions.
The story centers on Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), a battle weary coach whose old school mentality is behind the times. Pacino is at his best as a mess of a drunk, his sunken expression hanging off his face from the weight of his burden throughout. When his starting quarterback gets hurt (Quaid), Pacino looks to Willy Beaman, played by a surprisingly good Jaime Foxx. Foxx is the future of football, a cocky gunslinger who has speed to burn (Stone foresaw the new NFL QB: McNabb, Vick). At the movie's center is the conflict between old vs. new, the player vs. the team, and the cutthroat deals made behind the scenes.
This is a film about excess. From the all-star cast (Pacino, Foxx, Diaz, Quaid, Woods, LL Cool J, Margaret, Lancaster, L.T. and Jim Brown), to its indulgent criss-cut editing (brilliant during game scenes, excessive in others), to its run time (two and a half plus hours), this modern day gladiator movie balloons with bigness.
Kinetic and stylized, the film suffers from a familiar story and characters that are simply too unsympathetic to root for. And by the movie's end, redemption comes all too neatly during the final game (In mythic fashion, the team visits the dragon's lair to battle the Dallas ""Knights.""). If you're a fan of Oliver Stone or a fan of football, ""Any Given Sunday"" is worth a look.

So naturally when the DVD came out, i snapped it up.. along with every other cool movie i've seen lately. There's a trend building in the DVD world, and its double and even triple releases of a single movie.  Now to me i find that unfair.  I love all the extras that DVD has to offer, but if you go and buy the movie the minute it comes out, like you naturally want to do, your not necessarily getting everything you had hoped for.  This is a prime example, the DVD when it was origionally released had a bunch of extra stuff on it, but they obviously found more to put in it cause here they are with yet another release.  So me, as a buyer of many DVD's feels cheated, because now, if I want to see all the new features, I have to go out and buy the DVD all over again.  I thik its unfair to assume that people will buy this movie AGAIN, and i hope this trend doesn't continue, because thats one of the main resons i buy DVD's, there's so much more than VHS.

Oliver Stone has done a masterful job capturing football in it raw essence, while still appealing to the modern ""pop-hip-hop"" culture. A great cast is obviously a plus, but the main plus of the film is how Stone shows intertwining backgrounds and beliefs from many different characters (the aged coach questioning his position, the uexperienced rookie looking out for hiself, the grizzled veteran examining his past, the money-hungry team owner...). Any Given Sunday tops all other sports movies by telling a great story with jsut enough punch to keep auiences interested for the entire 2 1/2 hours. The rich cinema images and bone-crunching sounds are as necessary as they are exciting. Non-football fans should steer clear of this one, but for the rest, Stone has created an brilliant, very exciting cliche.",996796800,,936,5.124183006535947
1370239,5,B00004Y2R4,"This is not Oliver Stone's best movie, it is full of cliches, it is totally macho and often stereotypic, it is often pretentious in the way it is filmed.
But if you ever poured your heart out into anything, if you ever fought for something through pain, disillusion and disappointment, if you ever put on cleats, or skates or basketball shoes or anything to go out with a bunch of guys and win a game this movie will touch you deeply.
I guess you can always see the movie through the relatively simple plot but try instead to loose the perspective of a spectator and imagine yourself as one of those characters: the disillusioned coach who somehow fights through the emotional pain while it seems that there's nothing there left to keep him going, the ambitious, hotheaded and cynical thirdstring quarterback who wants to take on anybody and anything, the beleagured owner in the shadow of her father. If you can do that the film will be a rewarding emotional experience - if you can't it will be a somewhat old sports flick starring Pacino.
It is easiest to understand the movie if you were ever involved in competitive sports but trust Pacino when he says that the game of football is just like life - or rather what life was supposed to be about. Try exploring the parallels between football and life - think of your job, your company, etc.

1370251,3,B00004Y2R4,"You know, I like Al Pacino, I really do, but I am sick of him playing almost the same role over and over. It does not matter if he is a Mafia man, a football coach or a 60 Minutes producer... I think in each of the films (Donnie Brasco, Any Given Sunday, and The Insider, respectively), he has been someone's protector, insisting almost verbatim, ""I fought for you..."" In Donnie Brasco he takes Donnie (Johnny Depp) under his wing and mentors him and feels about him as though he were a son. In the Insider, he is a passionate 60 Minutes producer who convinces Jeffrey Wigand to be a whistlerblower on tobacco companies. When 60 Minutes will not air the piece, Pacino is livid and when confronted by Russell Crowe (as Wigand) he yells, ""I fought for you..."" In this film, Any Given Sunday, he feels paternal about his aging quarterback, Dennis Quaid, and tells him how he will fight for him and how he feels about him like a son. How many times do we need to see the same performance? I know, I might be stomping on hallowed ground. Pacino has paid his dues and I should not criticise, but has this thought occurred to anyone? That he has been playing and replaying the same roles? Of course, he is a prolific actor and there are many roles he has played which have no resemblance to these, but I am just picking out a pattern. Cannot be ignored. And he is superb in all these performances, so I am not complaining. I liked this film. It was an interesting look at football and its place in American society. I think, personally, that it is taken far too seriously, and I don't care about it. But to see that it warrants this kind of attention is a fascinating thought. It is interesting to see Pacino as a coach who appears to be in the twilight of his coaching career. He is being driven out by his traditional views, by the rich, young and aggressive woman who is in charge of the team (Cameron Diaz in a spectacularly bitchy role). Ageism is at work. She wants to push Pacino out to make room for Aaron Eckhart as coach. This has an interesting directorial style, probably because it was directed by Oliver Stone... you can always count on him for something at least a little out of the ordinary. A good, solid film, but by far not the best film Pacino has done nor is it the best film about football.",992131200,,2305,4.3503480278422275

I was never really a fan of American Football anbd still I wouldn't stay up during the night to see a game.....but this is just sensational. The movie puts you in the hotseat not only in the game itself but in all aspects from locker room tension to that felt in the characters. The script is well crafted, the acting very genuine and the action is vibrant. Having first watched this movie on board an aeroplane, I was anxious to see it again with the full ensemble of home cinema magic and it really paid off. Apart from the movie being excellent, there's enough extra stuff amongst special features to keep you entertained even more. (I recommend the special edition region 1 or region w disc).

He Holds his own in scenes with Al Pacino and Dennis Quaid; he even steals the show from them at some points.
This was quite a Shock to me, as Al Pacino and James Woods are two of my Favourite Actors. I Expected more from them, and I expected more from the film.
For the first Two hours of the films Three hour running time, Oliver Stone shows us something we haven't seen before, Behind the Scenes of the NFL. We see the Crooked Doctors, filling the injured players up with drugs to keep them playing. We see a lot more drug taking by the players Off the field. We see the In-fighting, the Politics of it all; we see everything they don't show us at Game time, Sunday morning.
But then, in the last hour, everyone in the film Matures, learns the Errors of their ways. It all becomes totally Cliqued and Silly. In a matter of minutes it turns from an Honest Expos into a Silly, Run-of-the-mill Football movie. It turns into ""The Replacements"" without the humour or any sense of fun.
Still, if you can forgive these fairly Large Misgivings, there are Great Performances to enjoy... Well, actually, Great Actors to enjoy. Al Pacino, James Woods, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz and Matthew Modine give performances that vary from Brilliant to Bad. Diaz at least tries to do a different role, and it comes off Ok, a little Annoying at times. Al and James do what is required of them, they Yell a lot and look Fierce. Dennis Quaid gives one of the Better performances, he looks Young and Tough enough to be playing the game, but also Old and Weathered enough to be wanting Out of it all. Matthew Modine looks like he signed on for the paycheque, he puts no effort into his dialogue and every time he opens his mouth, he Angered me. (What happened to him after ""Full Metal Jacket"") Charlton Heston's Cameo is a great moment, he proves why he is such a legend with about 2 minutes of Screen time. (Oliver Stone's cameo as a Commentator is pretty good to)
Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J steal the rug from under the Big named stars and both give Star-making Performances. I cannot complement them enough, I saw the movie so I could see Pacino and Woods, and I come out Raving about Foxx and Cool J. The Mere fact that they act opposite Al and Yell more than him, are more Passionate than he is should easily convince those Unbelievers out there.

Perhaps the worst part about this movie is the direction.  The film simply takes itself way, way too seriously.  This one goes off the scale of Oliver Stone's ""experimental film-making.""  One begins to think that they first had in mind a cinnematic version of Leo Tolstoy's ""War And Peace"" and only after the fact settled for making a football movie.  That's how overdone & stilted this film is.  At its best, the direction is strange & at its worse....well, it's downright silly.
The movie contains some former football players, such as Lawrence Taylor, but their inclusion does little to either help or hamper the film.  Al Pacino delivers a splendid performance of a driven, obsessed football coach (aren't they all driven & obsessed?) but even he can't save this theatrical Edsel.
The best sports movies end up not being about sports at all, but life.  This one attempts to transcend football, but ends up making the viewer feel as tho he has been repeatedly hit over the head with his own helmet.  There are far better sports movies out there, and a handful that are worse.  This one is nothing more than an overblown, overdone attempt of athletic dramaturgy.",984960000,,1423,4.818930041152264
1370256,3,B00004Y2R4,"Any Given Sunday
Score: 56/100
What a great looking film: Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid and Oliver Stone, together. It's simply remarkable that this turned out to be a below-average film. Such a good cast, such a good director and such a good trailer. What could've gone wrong?
An ageing football coach named Tony (Pacino) finds himself struggling with his personal and professional life while trying to hold his team together. A star quarterback has been knocked out of the game and a naive football player replaces him only to become exposed to the world of sports and become a danger to himself and to his players. Meanwhile, the coach finds himself constantly at battle with the team owner's money and power hungry daughter Christine (Cameron Diaz) intent on moving the team out.
Any Given Sunday made a decent amount of money at the box office and movie-reviewers enjoyed it. However, if you look at it from a different perspective, Any Given Sunday is too flawed to be enjoyed and has a touch of decency which makes it a film that doesn't deserved to be universally panned. Luckily for the team on-screen and off-screen, this film got hardly any bad ratings, most people rated it as the average mediocre movie. I was one of them, but I found a lot of flaws in the script and timing. The characters weren't developed enough before they started screeching at each other, it's simply too long and I left the cinema with the headache. However, Any Given Sunday is sometimes quite exciting and the cast make it bearable enough for the lazy running time.
Since the film is based on American football, it is mainly aimed at an American audience, which is unfortunate for eager New Zealander's. Oliver Stone's decision to go completely technical is sometimes acceptable, but to be honest, he needs to desperately measure up his game some time soon.",984787200,,1854,4.796875

And don't stone me but Al Pacino is not the image of football coach.  They have a certain personna and presence that Pacino just didn't embody in this film.  Nor did any of the great NFL legends who appeared.  Come on... Johnny Unitas as a coach.  Please.  He, Jim Brown, LT (who actually was perfect for this film), and Dick Butkus just didn't fit the mold.  Are they all worthy of adoration certainly but from the film's perspective they were out of place.
The characters aren't sufficiently developed and the intensity is lacking not to mention the fact that the pace of the film and particular scenes moved entirely to rapidly.  Too many images in too short of a period of time.

With an incredibly dull plot (if you can figure one out, I'd like to know), this movie lasts about an hour-and-a-half too long. The only way it escaped a 1-star rating is the very violent and unrealistically entertaining football game sequences. If this movie had a better plot, and all the off-game sequences were cut shorter, this movie could possibly get a four.
Oliver Stone should've definitely passed on this movie. He is one of the greatest movie veterans of our time, and I would be less assertive if someone else had directed this. This remark is not however, an insult to anyone in the cast and crew. But if someone else had directed it and other people acted in it, I wouldn't be badmouthing it as much, for I would not have expected much.

1370270,4,B00004Y2R4,"Any Given Sunday starts out as an insightful look into the world of professional football.  The movie begins very well by dropping us right into the middle of a game.  The camera work here is excellent (as it is in most of the movie) and we are able to both follow the action of the game and feel the intensity of the players.  But the aspect of most interest is the ""behind the scenes"" look it gives us.  For example, right off the bat the quarterback (Dennis Quaid) goes down.  The coach (Al Pacino) and the other players aren't to worried until the TV Coverage cuts to commercial and Quaid still can't get up.  Meanwhile the manager (Cameron Diaz) is upstairs haggling over the line-coaching staff and how soon Quaid will be back.
Unfortunately as the movie goes on it stops giving the viewer a new take on football and settles for the standard ESPN-style glorification of the ""gladiators"" who sacrifice so much to play the game.  By the end, it is a movie we have all seen before: the old ""root for the good-guys"" sports flick.  That said, the movie is an exciting ride and well worth watching.

1370271,5,B00004Y2R4,"Any Given Sunday has all the elements of a riveting ensemble- the cast is terrific with many good actors. Al Pacino plays the head coach of the mediocre Miami Sharks, Tony D'Amato, an underdog team that has just lost it's first string quarterback, played by Dennis Quaid, and it's second string quarterback in back-to-back plays. Pacino has no choice but to send in the inexperienced Willie Beaman. My biggest suprise was that Jamie Fox from the WB network, who plays Beaman, was fantastic. He was so good he should have been nominated for best supporting actor that year. Other performances are played by Hames Woods, LL Cool J, and Cameron Diaz, as the owner of team and the niece of Pacino.
Willie Beaman starts off horribly, but gradually improves and becomes the team's star player. But the success goes to his head, and gets under Pacino's skin. Beaman changes the plays in the huddles without the coach's or offensive coordinator's consent, and runs off at the mouth with teammates and to Pacino. But he is winning the games, and (almost) everyone watching likes Beaman, forcing Al Pacino to reevaluate the way he coaches, if winning is more important than teamwork and playing hard.
When it comes to the football sequences, the cinemtography is wonderful, this is where Oliver Stone shows his true talent. You feel like you are on the field, especially with the digital sound and great picture that accompanies this disc. There are also a few never before seen scenes in this DVD release, nothing major, but still a good feature.

Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid and Cameron Diaz all were excellent in this movie as well. Cameron plays the woman everyone loves to hate and she does a good job of it too in this movie ~~ unlike ""There's Something About Mary."" Jamie Foxx plays his character with depth ~~ you can actually see him grow into his role by the end of the movie. He comes off so angry that you can actually feel it emitting from the TV screen. I think he's an actor Hollywood needs to keep an eye on. If he continues to act like he did in this movie, he'll go far.
This is more than a football movie. It talks about the future and about going after your dreams. It shows the depth and range of human emotions tied to a dream.

Oliver Stone is a fine movie director although his recent offerings have been paltry, including this one. The violent and break-neck on-field action is captured perfectly. The problem lies within the movie's insipid two-dimensional characters. Al Pacino brings a wearied cynicism to his role as Coach D'Amato and is excellent as usual. The only other credible characters are a cocky halfback played by professional rapper LL Cool J, and Matthew Modine as a conscienious team doctor.
The second disc of this 2-disc set features screen tests, including a home video of Jamie Foxx tossing a football in a park. It also features a 'making of' plus there are deleted scenes with commentary by Oliver Stone. If you enjoyed the movie, I definitely recommend this movie for purchase for it's superb extras.
Many will find this movie slow-moving despite the football action, though. It's standard fare as far as football films go. There is nothing here that hasn't been done already which leads one to re-think the whole football film genre.

The blood, guts, girls, drugs, injuries...blah, blah, blah.  Any Given Sunday is just that...blah!  This mostly impart because of the acting and writing.  Al Pacino does a brilliant job of portraying head coach, Tony D'Amato and John C. McGinley, a great character actor, as his biggest critic.  Other than that there really isn't anything to right home about.  Cameron Diaz, the owner of the Sharks cannot pull off the ""She would eat her own children"" remark whispered by a colleague, simply because she is all over the board with her emotions.  One moment she is screaming at Al, the next sympathetic, so she didn't come off as bad as I think was planned.

Sadly these performances are the result of the writing.  I got a little tired of the ""this is your last season"" hints and the same old arguments over and over again.  Where is the variety?!?!  Then you have Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Joe Montana...oh, I mean Jack ""Cap"" Rooney.  Puhleez!  Just to round up the rest of the review, there was the predictable outcome, unresolved allegations and several bad rap videos.

This is of course the ""Director's Cut"" but unfortunately it is only of the movie.  I would have hoped for some special features.  Interactive menus, Notes on the Stars and Director, Theatrical Trailers, Scene Access and subtitles are NOT special features.  So really all you get out of this movie is a rap video and a documentary.  Where is the commentary?

It is painfully obvious that Oliver Stone directed.  In some of his other works, such as Natual Born Killers, the cutaway scenes randomly inserted MTV-style seem to work.  Then again, Any Given Sunday is not an exploration of the minds of serial killers, it's a football movie.  Thus, when dialogue is happening and the camera cuts away to clouds, gladiator movies, old football clips, and time-lapse garbage, it is simply annoying.
Pacino is Pacino - the agitated coach you expect.  Diaz does a good job at being the snotty brat - almost too good a job.  No one expects much from LL Cool J or Jamie Foxx, so we should not be disappointed there.  Luckily for them, acting takes a back seat here to camera angles, music and flash.
Altogether, it gets old quickly.  The already-too-thin plot snaps in half, and the various threads of ending are readily predictable.  Long before the end, I was ready for baseball season.",980726400,,1103,4.703125

I also consider myslef a knowledgeable football fan, who has played the game at a competitive level. Any Given Sunday can be described in an old Hollywood adage, ""Over the top"". North Dallas Forty was an exceptional picture that finally exposed the horrors of pro football. The ""win at all costs"" mentality was always perceived as ""boyish competion"" and for many years the behind the door cruelty of the game was hushed. God Forbid, we disrupt the sanctity of the NFL and it's millions of fans perched high upon their lazy-boys with Budweiser's in tow. ""Any Given"" gives us an upclose and personal look at those horrors. Be it medical malpractice, contract disputes or genuine bad behavior the state of the Miami Sharks is in shambles. Coach Dematto, played with a contrived enthusiasm by Pacino, is short on energy and considered a dinasour in today's fast paced game. Cameron Diaz plays the megaowner who's lost in her late daddy's shadow, with intentions to sell the team and undermine Dematto. With the multitude of characters Pacino has played with consumate authentication; I just cannot perceive him as a head football coach. His halftime speech is awful and seems less spontaneous and more rehearsed. The action scenes are too difficult to follow at times ,including a scene where an eyeball pops onto the artificial turf after a bone jarring hit. Jaime  Foxx, steals the show as quaterback Willie Beamon, an unambitous third stringer who steps into the starter role and has to deal with the fame of being a starting quaterback",980208000,,1668,4.957142857142857

His JFK and Natural Born Killers were Supurb!!  That being said, I didn't expect less from Any Given Sunday.  Sure, it's controversial and filled with violence, drugs, sex, and money.  Tell us something we DON'T know!  Football is full of ""prep talks"" and ""big money.""  Sure it's nice to see and hear, but after that game, it means nothing.  The athletes played for years and yet their attention is ONLY focused on the big prep talk, that 15 minutes of energy filled tongue whipping and bam, the next morning they're doing what they're doing, irrelevant to what just happened and forgetting what they heard. So is true for this film.  Not only did I enjoyed the 3 hour experience, but I left the theatre psyched up.  The next morning, I can't remember what the hell I just saw. I rented and then bought this movie because of Mr. Stone.  I love his works and I can't leave out this one.  But I can't help feeling empty and slighted by this movie.  So much of it was MTV-type production: big and loud music, pretty sexy girls, drugs, and football.  The football scenes were second to the private introspective fight of the coach.  The coach: Brilliant performance.  Seen that, done it twice, go on.  That sums up Al Pacino's performance and character.  Go on to Cameron Diaz's tough owner character and performance.  A total non-believable yawner.  Ho-hum.  Major Leagues (the movie) was tons better.  At least THAT owner showed some nastiness and hate. The players are aren't acting, they are being themselves.  I can't see one iota of growth or change.  No sympathy given to any of those players.  And believe me, I want to feel something for them.  So what can we expect from this movie?  Big noise, yes.  Big football scenes, sure.  MTV-ish movie, definately.  A movie with heart, no.  A movie worth owning, no.  An Oliver Stone achievement, not worth mentioning.",980121600,,2028,4.752161383285302

If you're looking forward to the football playing scenes, be prepared to be vexed and disoriented. Stone obviously tried to stage the football scenes in a unique way, and there's nothing wrong with that, but his method just didn't work, at many times giving you just very bad views of the action on the field. Not all that is different is good. The plot was nothing too interesting or original either. There are many better football films out there.",979516800,2,607,4.682242990654205

1370293,2,B00004Y2R4,"Oliver Stone likes beating up the people who decide to watchhis movies.
He does it here not to show us El Salvador, or a famousrock band or politics , or how the media assaults us,or even theVietnam War,-- he does it because of football.
FOOTBALL?
And he has nothing more to say than was already very well stated in a much better film, North Dallas Forty.
There aren't just  five or six multiple quick cut establishing shots to begin nearly every scene in this film, there are a dozens.  There are strange shots which make no sense whatsoever but merely serve as something that was shot to stick between two other shots.  There are triple and quadruple angles on charging football players, shots from inside football helmets, crane shots, steadicam shots, and lots of tracking and hand held shots.  You don't get any sense of what play is being run however. You're not ever shown a complete play from start to finish.  We just get chaos.
There are huge booming bangs and mini-explosions as football player tackle each other and then suddenly, the sound disappears completely.  There's slow-mo, there's some digitally altered work with motion and speed.  It's all here.
Why?
To excite, titilate, entertain, overwhelm and bulldoze an audience into thinking it's watching an important Oliver Stone movie of course.
Because of the flash and over-kill it takes Stone a full 45 minutes to set up the film. It could have been done in ten.  Lots of characters to introduce us to.  None of them are original and none of them will have any depth.  Oh sure there's an impressive list of actors on view, and I almost expected Bruce Dern as a terrorist and the Goodyear blimp to show up.  The plot?  Not a lot to that either. The Miami Sharks have lost 4 games straight and the once great team may not make the play-offs.  It's star quarterback is getting old and yikes... gets badly injured.  Out of nowhere the third string quarterback shows promise, but he's not a team player.  The coach has lost his fire for the game.  The new team owner is a young overly ambitious woman who wants to prove she can more ruthless and heartless than anyone.. even Steinbrenner!!!  She wants to win and doesn't care who she has to threaten, fire, or manipulate to do it.  Sound familiar?
Of course it does.
All of the characters we meet in Any Given Sunday are familiar and you the viewer can color them in.  In fact, you better have a lot crayons  because as these characters are written there isn't much offered in terms of depth or nuance.  Nuance?  Who's got time for such things in a 2 and a half hour Oliver Stone movie.  Now pardon me while I add some elements to this shot... I'll have some music playing, I'll have a sports guy on the television talking quite negatively about the coach of the Sharks (Al Pacino) while he sits in the crowded bar getting very drunk (what a man!) and is propositioned by a young high priced hooker, Elizabeth Berkley.  They'll seem like there are five or six things  going on at once.  Of course none of it is very important, or original, but  the audience will be just over-whelmed with all this stuff, all this detail.  Well unimportant, details... but lots of them.  Movement, noise, lots of cuts.
There are some great shots in this movie.  But when you throw this much at the wall, some of it has to stick.
Occasionally, when you senses aren't being over-loaded and assaulted by a chaotic cacophony of sound, camera movement and weird quick cuts and camera angles, you realize there are some really awful bits of dialogue being spouted in this film. In fact there are several scenes which really needed a zinger, a clever line, a nice bit of business, a special moment, to make the scene work or even have any purpose whatsoever-and  we get nothing.  It lies there.  Well it doesn't lie there exactly because we are always cutting, the camera is always moving.
There might be some people who are fooled by this technique, but most will get very tired of it after the films first half hour.  It doesn't build, it has no where to go, it's already started at a manic over-the top level.  Where is it going to go?
What's really annoying is how repetitive the film.  You have all these camera angles, all these tricks, all this coverage of every conceivable angle. . . from a puppet master director who doesn't trust his audience, his script or even his actors.  He manipulates every single aspect of what we are watching.  Rarely is a shot held for move than a few seconds.  He keeps moving but it's over the same territory over and over and over again.
It wides up not being exhilarating, not being revealing, just head-ache inducing.
Over and over and over again we are shown bits of pieces of the game in almost the same way. Once, twice, three and four times we see similar types of shots of crowds, fans, coaches, players, refs, cheerleaders, people in the press box...(.  Eeek.. There's Oliver Stone doing play by play announcing) not just introducing the big game... but as a prelude to every game we see, even to one of the practices.  Look look...  We got a big budget to spend and we can hire lots of extras... I can shoot lots and lots of film.  Looky Looky...!!!!
It gets really ridiculous at times if you're not too numb and utterly desensitized to pay attention. Like when we hear an announcer on t.v.  talking about `a swirl of events', and the camera is on a team graphic and begins to swirl slightly as it cuts to another shot, probably one of a team flag, there's lots of shots of team flags.  What clever, brilliant, film-making.
There's nothing new here, just flash and more flash on a subject that's been written about and filmed many times and more effectively than Stone manages to do. Go see North Dallas Forty, or Hoop Dreams again before bothering with this time-waster that will wind up making aspirin manufacturers some extra profits.
I can just imagine Oliver Stone someday doing a commentary track for this film (he doesn't on DVD out now) and talking about how shortened  attention spans ,challenged him to create the ultimate modern football/gladiator movie.  A movie where the game is more than a game.  And of course when a game becomes more important than just a game it means the participants must sacrifice everything real--marriages, morals, even ethics and so his movie sacrifices everything in presenting the GAME.  Uh-huh.  Even if Stone were to actually say something like this, it would be far more interesting than anything he has presented to us in this chaotic, numbing, repetitive, headache inducing, everything but the kitchen sink two and a half hour update of  ESPN's best of Sport Center: The  Football edition  he has the temerity to call a film.

1370294,2,B00004Y2R4,"It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play the game.  Football as a metaphor for life; you have to fight for every inch, on the field, as in life.  Or perhaps on the ""playing"" field that ""is"" life.  Take your pick, you get the idea; whatever you choose you can bet it's a concept director Oliver Stone apparently seems to think he originated in his over-long, self-indulgent miasma ""Any Given Sunday,"" starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz and Dennis Quaid.  A decent movie?  Yes.  Original?  No.  Stone pulls out every cliche in the book, twists it all like so much play dough to put his own spin on it and serves it up like so many hot dogs you can buy at the stadium while you watch his fictitious Miami Sharks play.  The recipe for this particular potpourri includes the quarterback willing to play-through-the-pain-for-the-team; the third-stringer whose success goes to his head; discrimination; locker room scene after locker room scene that play like, well, locker room scenes; players with names like ""Madman,"" ""Beastman,"" ""J-Man,"" ""Shark"" and ""Cap;"" a ruthless, young General Manager/owner who inherited the position from her father; the unethical team physician whose diagnoses of injured players coincide with the needs of the team; the young, ethical assistant team physician; and the legendary coach who just wants to inspire his team and win one more.  The title of this film could have been ""Any Given Sports Film.""  All of which may seem contradictory after stating that this is a ""decent"" film.  Perhaps.  But understand that by decent I mean that this movie was, if nothing else, a professional endeavor that was packaged and delivered in a way you would expect from the star-studded cast Stone assembled here.  The problem lies with Stone, whose work on this project fairly rings of arrogance and self aggrandizement.  All of the aforementioned ""potpourri"" ingredients, for instance, are actually legitimate aspects of this story; but in Stone's hands the legitimate comes across as cliche, while any attempt at profundity seems merely pretentious.  His endless use of slow motion photography during the game sequences ultimately has a nullifying effect on the drama it is, I assume, meant to enhance; and it's a perfect example of the excesses he allowed himself that give this movie the sense of pretending to be something it is not.  It's a case of the artist who is too close to his work being given too much freedom, or in this case, enough rope with which to hang himself.  Pacino is a star, always larger than life, with an incomparable screen presence from whom we've come to expect a certain quality of performance.  And here, as Coach Tony D'Amato, he certainly does not disappoint.  That his character lacks originality is not his fault; it's the part he was given and he makes the most of it.  To his credit he keeps him interesting, even though this is a guy you've seen a number of times in just as many movies.  Cameron Diaz does not fare as well; she simply was not given the time necessary to develop her character, Christina Pagniacci (The time was available, but Stone chose to use it for yet nine or ten more slow-mo close-ups of a hand reaching, reaching, reaching for a football prominently featuring the ""Wilson"" brand), and Dennis Quaid fell victim as well with his portrayal of Cap Rooney.  Jamie Foxx fared as well as anyone involved as third-string quarterback Willie Beamen, and there are some notable supporting performances from Lawrence Taylor (Shark), LL Cool J (J-Man) James Woods (Dr. Mandrake), Matthew Modine (Dr. Powers) and Ann-Margret (Margaret Pagniacci).  Charlton Heston, however, is wasted in a cameo as the Commissioner of the League.  Some would say you do not necessarily have to like football to like this movie; that may be true.  Subjectively, I would say that to like this movie at all, you must approach it with very low expectations (and it certainly wouldn't hurt if you did like football).  As I see it, with ""Any Given Sunday"" Oliver Stone lowered the bar and allowed himself to step over the line, which is especially disappointing in light of the fact that this is the director who gave us such excellent, thought-provoking films as ""Platoon,"" ""JFK,"" and ""Born On The Fourth Of July.""  And in the future, I'm sure he'll add more titles to that list; unfortunately, this film will not be one of them.",978566400,2,4374,4.850605652759085
1370295,4,B00004Y2R4,"""Any Given Sunday"" is the only football-based movie in modern-day entertainment that doesn't hold back on anything at all. It shows the true events of a common professional football team. Their ups and downs are both included; this movie isn't just football; it dives into the lives of professional athletes and is very descriptive in that it shows how they(players) often get wrapped up in greed, hate and envy. It shows of how friends can turn against each other in the case of greed and it shows things such as the players and coaches opinions of the mass media. The players and management study their sports on and off the gridiron. When the movie shows the game going on, it feels like you're playing. It is right there with the play and every sound made and movement is right with you and it shows everyone what it is really like. Contrary to other football movies like ""The Replacements"", it doesn't say that the good guys always win. BELIEVABLE STORY.  Pacino does another very convincing and emotional role and Jamie Foxx does fairly decent in one of his non-comedy roles.  If you look at this in the eyes that ""it's just a football movie"" then it will seem far too long. But, if you understand it's depth and truancy of the sports world, you'll enjoy this.

The only extras are a documentary, a trailer, and a music video.  There is also some extra footage thrown in.  Although lacking features, sound makes up for the lack of extras.

1370323,5,B00004Y2R4,"When this movie first came out to its slate of tepid reviews, I decided not to go see it.  When the DVD came out, I decided not to buy it.  When I recently received the DVD as a gift, I was surprised to find that I honestly couldn't wait to watch it.  Admittedly, I have always found Oliver Stone's films to be entertaining.  I am also a life-long Cowboys fan.  And, truth be known, I was curious to see what Stone thought about the state of professional football, albeit via his mythical Miami Sharks.  The best thing that I ever did was to quit reading reviews, and sat down with a bowl of popcorn to give this film its shot.
The verdict is that I really liked this film.  Call it a guilty pleasure if you must, but I really enjoyed this movie.  The screenplay is structured around some interesting and engaging characters, providing good insights into their individual experiences with the team. The cast is first rate and there are plenty of good performances.  From the owner's box, to the training room, at home with the wife and kids, and off the field with all of its complications, this movie does a memorable job of showing all sides of the world of professional football.  I even liked the movie soundtrack with its catchy tunes.  No offense to the other reviewers, but Heston is perfect as the power-mongering league commissioner.  James Woods is great as the veteran team physician who has seen too much.  Jim Brown and LT give accurate and believable performances in their respective roles.  I also found the parallels between the film's plot line and the present day soap opera going on with my beloved Cowboys to be kind of spooky.  True, there are times when the plot to this movie looks a little too clich.  I find it to be a point to the film's level of authenticity, however, that the current highest paid player in the NFL is perhaps living out an eerily similar experience with his family, doctors, coaches and owner.
This movie is not a classic but there is a lot about it that holds up in repeated viewings.  The dog-eat-dog world of the professional athletics is portrayed in some admittedly predictable scenes, but there are some nice surprises as well.  The ending to this movie is, for me, its truest moment.  I think that the best thing about this movie is that while it deals competently with the intensity and pathos of professional football, it never forgets to keep its sense of humor.  If you can do the same thing, my guess is that you will really enjoy this movie.  There is a lot more about it that works than most of these reviews would lead you to believe.",973641600,14,2595,4.5139186295503215
1370324,3,B00004Y2R4,"Oliver Stone's cinematic obsession with portrayting American culture as a Vietnam battleground continues with this exhausting study of their national sport.
Once again abandoning the traditional story-telling conventions in favour of flashy cutting, trippy camerawork and a barrage of electic musical snippets, this is a game of two halves. Although the hour or so of in-your-face American football footage is hypnotic, thrilling, scary and technically astounding, the off-field conflicts offer the same old tired sports cliches, albeit with big names and Stone's eccentric camerawork.
The first half hour of the film is almost a mini masterpiece. Sticking the audience smack in the middle of a ferocious game of American footbal, he brilliantly orchestrates frenetic, muddy, bloody, bone-crunching MTV visuals in a Natural Born Killers vein, and introduces the stressed protagonists. There's explosive coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), cynical owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz), dedicated star player 'Cap' Rooney (Dennis Quaid) and self-important star player to-be Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx).  When Rooney receives a major injury, Beaman is thrust into the spotlight and begins to show his potential. As his quarterback skills improve and the team seems destined for a play-off place, his arrogant disregard for the rest of the team causes majoy ructions. Meanwhile, Tony and Christina's major hate-hate relationship worsens.
There's a handful of other subplots too, which you could probably write yourself and the fine supporting cast - James Woods, Matthew Modine and Aaron Eckhart - are criminally underused. The behind-the-scenes drama is decently performed, but it seems so flat and pedestrian compared to the explosive games, that you find yourself willing on the next touchdown. Pacino is energetic as usual, even if he is in shouty auto-pilot, Foxx is almost Oscar-worthy in a memorable performance, and Diaz is pretty amazing, it is good to see the actress playing different roles, as her character, Christina Pagniacci is a cold-hearted bitchy business woman, and Diaz usally plays blonde sweet-hearts.
It would seem that the character-and-plot driven days of Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July are long gone for Oliver Stone. Pushing the technical envelope is an alright decision, but it is about time Stone varied his game a little.",973382400,,2355,5.505524861878453

The editing is perfect and the cinematography puts us in the game itself! We sense the bone crunching reality of each play. It is sort of a mock documentary in a way. Al Pacino and Jamie Foxx give stellar performances, as do the rest of the wonderful cast. It shows that these actors have a lot of range in their work. I was surprised to see Elizabeth Berkley in the cast. Many actual NFL players also had signifigant parts in this film. Randy Quaid gives one of his best performances here as the teams number one player who is suffering from and injury and is homebound.

1370329,5,B00004Y2R4,"This Oliver Stone film goes behind the scenes of big time football and delves into it all -- the aging coach, the rich-girl team owner, the players who push themselves through injuries, the rising young star and the living-large seductive lifestyle of big money.
I'm surprised that this film did not win one Academy Award nomination because it certainly deserved to be considered.  Not only did the story keep me glued to the screen for its full 157 minutes, but all the performances were excellent.
Al Pacino, as the coach, was outstanding.  At 60 years old his face has the creases which add expression and depth to his performance, making me feel his every emotion.  Jamie Fox, cast as the new young overnight sensation has a role that demands he first be unsure and vulnerable, then cocky and insufferable, then political and, finally, repentant.  That's a tall order for a actor and he does it masterfully.
The rest of the cast is full of star power.  Cameron Diaz is the young woman who has inherited the team from her father.  Ann Margaret is her alcoholic mother.  Dennis Quaid is an injured quarterback, LJ Cool is a football player, James Woods is the unscrupulous doctor, and even Charlton Heston plays a cameo role as the Commissioner.  And, of course, there are some real players who round out this cast.
One of the criticisms of the film is that the sports action was difficult to follow because of the cinematographic effects using slow motion spinning of the football or the silhouettes of the men postured as if on a battlefield. But this not a football game to watch on TV.  This is a larger-than-life mythic tale of modern-day gladiators who push themselves past the line of good sense for fame, fortune, money and glory and the corporate interests and media hype that keep it all together.

I had trouble finding a storyline because of the frenzied editing and vibrant soundtrack. Not everyone will be ready to see such scenes that take place in the locker room where the players unleash their pent-up frustration with no shame.

Along with a great soundtrack, the movie really shines as one of the best football flicks to date. Pacino's ""before the big game speech"" in this is also incredibly well written, and he sells it with the perfect amount of emotion.

1370346,3,B00004Y2R4,"Oliver Stone takes another sharp turn! This time, with a fictional football movie titled Any Given Sunday. The movie packs more stars than a Cannonball Run movie! Al Pacino stars as Tony D'Amato, experienced head coach of the professional football team, the Miami Sharks. Having to deal with the loss of his 39 year old, 3 time MVP Quarterback played by Dennis Quaid (think of a has-been like Steve Young!), he's forced to start a young and upcoming  3rd string QB, Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). As the movie progresses, Beamen gets the taste of the real football world; such as, women, money, cars and the fast life. Losing his extremely beautiful girlfriend in the process, played by Lela Rochon. As Beamen's ego keeps building and building, so are the anger towards him from fellow team mates, played by LL Cool J and Lawrence Taylor. At the same time, you find Coach D'Amato fighting his own personal battles with Beamen and the Sharks owner, played by Cameron Diaz.
The movie also stars James Woods, Charlton Heston, Matthew Modine, Bill Bellamy, Lauren Holly, Jim Brown, Ann Margret and Oliver Stone himself. What I didn't like about the movie was the camera angles and shots that Oliver Stone took. He also over did it on the slow motion shots. If he would've cut down on that, it would've put the movie right under 2 hours. What I liked about it was the little humor that was in it every once in a while. Also, Jamie Foxx played a less comical role and more of a serious role. Overall, I would give the movie 3 1/2 stars. I was very disappointed with the ending. Surprisingly, what I thought was the end of the movie actually wasn't.

1370370,3,B00004Y2R4,"Oliver Stone's movies usually tackle issues that main stream society tends to ignore.  From anti-war to anti-government to anti-media, he exposes the overlooked consequences of what makes us 'proud to be an American.'  In this movie, however, he seems to have lost something. 'Any Given Sunday' begins to reveal the violence and life threatening effects football can have on its players, but a Hollywood ending defeats any point.  Dennis Quaid plays an aging QB, whose body has been through so much his body can hardly function properly.  He doubts his ability to still perform, but thanks to his wife, who is more concerned with her own prestige than her husband's heath, he gives it one more go.  Is it worth risking your health and wellbeing after you've already accomplished so much?  But the really terrible part takes place between the coach, the team doctor, and an injured player.  After the coach fires the doc for not telling an injured player he's unfit to play, he tells the player, with a straight face, he can still play.  The coach has everything to gain (money, victory, prestige...) and only to lose a player's health.  Kind of sick how they think.  It's too bad the player doesn't get paralyzed.  At least then it would show that there are limitations that not even money can patch up.  Look at Muhammad Ali, one of the revolutionary thinkers of the 20th century whose full potential as a leader was cut short, or any retired pro-football player over 60- if you can find any seeing as that exceeds their life expectancy.  I was very disappointed the only director who could deal with the realistic issues didn't.  It's still an entertaining movie that I recommend, but it could have been historic.",970012800,,1715,4.808873720136519
1370371,1,B00004Y2R4,"""Any Given Sunday"" is a rare study in just how inept a film can be.  For those who truly haven't seen a lousy film lately, this is a must rent.  It takes the oft-scorned, ""No Editor Necessary"" approach that so many films these days succumb to.  We get everything with this film.  Every incoherant plot twist, every useless sub-plot, every poorly acted scene, every badly cut exchange between two actors talking to different cameras, every badly written dramatic exchange...it's all there.  Indeed it is good that Oliver Stone in his graciousness allowed us to see that this is indeed one of the worst films of all time and there was nothing left on the editing room floor to redeem it.
Punctuating the oppressive boredom in two places, is, to no surprise, Al Pacino, who first pins Fox's ears back in a wonderful scene where he lectures about what it in fact means to be a quarterback.  The movie's best scene, (I'll admit, my hair stood up on the back of my neck) is Pacino's pep talk right before they take the field in the last game.  The words and tone that Pacino uses are wonderful, though wasted in this sea of in your face filmmaking.",970012800,12,1142,4.541463414634146
1370372,3,B00004Y2R4,"I am a passing football viewer (go Jets!) and I was interested in this movie, not because of the football, not because of Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz or Oliver Stone, because I love NFL films.  They makes some of the best recordings and could give all other sports filmworks a run for their money.  They take the gridiron and change it into the stuff of legends.  When I saw my first NFL tape, I didn't know Football could be so dramatic.
The movie is based on several characters of the fake Miami Sharks.  The first is the aging coach, who is losing control of his team to an owner who thinks she knows more about the game than the old grizzled 30 year veteran.  The coach is a worn out Al Pacino, who shines in the role of Tony D'Amato.  Al would make a great coach, because all he does is give grandiose speeches in his movies and yell real loud.  The owner is Cameron Diaz, who took over the team when her father died.  She has real veins of steel in this movie and goes toe to toe with Pacino and gives as well as she gets.  Their relationship is very stormy and a delight to watch them both.
Another story is about Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx).  He is the the (Kurt) Warneresque third string QB given a chance to shine when the aging star Cap Rooney is injured.  He is so nervous that he pukes on the fifty yard line (Right on the Team Logo!), but he begins to shine and nearly wins his first game for them.  He is humble and awestruck in the early stages of the movie, but once his career gets going, he becomes this arrogant jerk who suddenly begins to think he's god gift to football.  His arrogance nearly upends the team, as he disregards plays the coach tell him to run, he disses their star player Julian Washington (LL Cool J) and ...... of the Defensive Captain Luther Lavoy (A mean Lawrence Taylor).  Jamie Foxx's performance steals this movie away from all the other high profile actors.  He has this intensity that I never saw on his stupid Jamie Foxx show and he has the tools to become a great actor.  Just look at his fire at a dinner meeting he has with Pacino.
Cap Rooney is a sub-story and his is about the aging superstar (read: Dan Marino).  He is still good, but age is getting to him and he becomes paranoid about slipping into oblivion when Beaman is discovered.  The relationship with Beaman is all politically driven and the pressures on Rooney are intense (especially from his wife, played with icyness by Lauren Holly).
The final sub-story is with Lawrence Taylor, Cap Rooney and the two doctors Dr. Mandrake (James Woods) and Allie Powers (Matthew Modine).  Stone takes a stab at the back-end politics of Football, how the owners and doctors really only see these people as pieces of meat money-makers.  One chilling scene is between Diaz and Woods, where she applies the non too subtle pressure to play Lavoy for the final, even if it will cost him his life.  Mandrake, apart of the system and paid handsomely for it, is more than happy to oblige.
The story also takes other issues such as racism in the Football league, owners plotting to get new stadiums, the immoralities of being a ball player, people giving up everything (including family) for the game as well as players playing for performance bonuses, rather than for the team.
The DVD has excellent picture and the sound is fantastic.  The mixture of hip-hop and Metallica really intensifies the adrenaline in the picture.  The extras are pretty slim though, with only a trailer, video by LL Cool J (......) and the making.
While the performances all stand out (including non-actor Lawrence Taylor), the directing is mixed.  There are some excellent scenes and the hit on Beaman in the rain (where his helmet goes flying) had some slow motion scenes, the ones involving the shaky cam (for realistic effect) were annoying, even nauseating to watch.  Stone is an advocate for quick cuts, but at times it's so fast that all I get is a headache.  If only we could get that director who did all those NFL films, then I would have given this movie a much higher rating....Rating: B-",969840000,8,4065,4.5040871934604905

There are some interesting camera angles, innovative football shots and a good performance by Al Pacino, but that's about it. The story is all over the place and the dialog is not particularly well written; the movie is about 40 minutes too long; characters suddenly change their outlook near the end of the film, with no apparent motivation; Stone's trademark incredible cynicism about women is in full form (the wife of an incredibly banged-up 39-year-old quarterback HITS HIM IN THE FACE when he says he won't play next year, and Cameron Diaz just yells constantly); there is male full frontal nudity; a player loses a BODY PART on the field (was this supposed to be funny?); at one point we're suddenly asked to start caring about these people when all of the previous movie had been a biting, over-the-top (way over) indictment of pro sports; and just too much bouncy, quick-cut editing, an announcement of BIG MEANING, when there's no story there.

1370375,3,B00004Y2R4,"I love sports and sports flicks.  That is the very reason I didn't care for this film.  This film is not a film about football; it is a film about  Oliver Stone.  With ""Any Given Sunday"", Stone has created his most  ambitious tribute to his own megalomania.  This film is a classic example  of excessive style negating substance.  Stone was so intent on showing us  the sizzle, that he cooked all of the flavor out of the steak.  A good  director uses innovative technique to enhance the telling of the story.  An  egomaniac uses the story as an excuse to show off his talent and  creativity.  The result of such self-indulgence is almost always a  diminishment of the final product.
Here Stone tries to out-hip the hip  generation of directors by providing a staccato progression of weird  angles, extreme close-ups and disjointed perspective shots with so many  jump cuts that it makes ""The Limey"" look like it is on tranquilizers.  I  have never seen so much dialogue delivered by actors with half their heads  cut off.  The hand held football sequences were dreadful; as cameras were  pounded into the turf without regard to the action that we were supposed to  be following.  The entire movie was like a three-hour music video, with  images flitting willy-nilly as if they were being shot by a drunken  mosquito.  Ironically, Stone failed to learn the lesson learned by Willie  Beaman (Jamie Foxx) in the story; that is that the good of the whole is  more important than the glory of the individual.
It is a pity, because  buried beneath all this decadent directorial tripe, there was a good sports  story and some terrific acting.  We saw how money and greed adulterates the  sport and how athletes too often become selfish and conceited as they bask  in the limelight.  There was also the drama of the comeback in the critical  game, which was dissipated by Stone's erratic camera work and editing.
Al  Pacino gave a great performance as the legendary coach past his prime, who  let his pride stand in the way of the team's success.  Cameron Diaz rose  above her accustomed quirky lightweight roles to deliver a stunning  performance as the hard-as-nails club owner trying to move out of her dead  father's shadow.  Jamie Foxx was electric as the third string quarterback  who explodes into the public eye and begins taking himself far too  seriously, evoking the ire of his teammates.
This film had a great cast  and a solid story that was marred by a narcissistic director who rendered  it annoying to watch.  I rated it a 5/10.  It's a shame, because I love  sports stories and I never got a chance to enjoy this one.",969321600,3,2627,4.686534216335541
1370376,2,B00004Y2R4,"If you plan on watching this movie as a fan of the sport of football like I was, you will most likely be disappointed.  The shaky filming of the  action sequences made these scenes more annoying than exciting.  Another  annoyance was that the game sequences didn't seem to be complete.  One  moment it would be all tied up, and then the next moment it's halftime and  you've missed two or three scores with no idea how they went down.  This  prevented any kind of 'flow' for the game you were watching from  developing.  As a football fan, I would have much preferred the shots to be  from a wider angle rather than the extremely close views that were mostly  presented.  I see a guys leg flash by on the screen in closeup, how am I  supposed to tell what's happening from that?
I also never really actually  grew to LIKE any of the football playing characters in the film.  I saw  them all presented as immature and frankly so full of themselves I almost  wanted them all to lose.  I suppose that's probably an accurate  presentation of todays professional athelete however.
On the plus side,  the locker room pep talk speeches were well written and inspiring.  Al  Pacino as always was fantastic as a Vince Lombardi type of coach.",969321600,6,1232,4.52054794520548

Meanwhile, the coach finds himself  constantly at battle with the team owner's money and power hungry daughter  intent on moving the team out.
Any Given Sunday is definitely not a  terrible film, but it is not a great one. When, I came out from the cinema  I was thinking it WAS a terrible waste of time, but now, with more thought,  Any Given Sunday has become slightly more likeable. I realised Jamie Foxx  gave an almost Oscar-worthy performance, Al Pacino was awesome as the  coach, Cameron Diaz was daringly pleasing and LL Cool J was hip-ly  entertaining as the American-football star.
Still, Any Given Sunday is  not a flawless movie. It begins to be tiresome watching Pacino and Diaz  scream at each other for 2 hours and 50 minutes, which is also far too long  for an American sports flick.

As bad, it also  featured one of my favorite actors, Al Pacino.  Finally, when it came out  on DVD, I had to give it a try.  Stone and Pacino came through strongly  once again, I must admit.  Similar to Stone's taking us into the Vietnam  War at ""grunt"" level, in this film he lets us experience football  right out on the field with the players.  He spares us nothing.  It is  incredibly violent and you hear, see and feel all of that violence.  Actually, I found it more violent than ""Platoon.""  I'm glad I saw  it on DVD because I don't think I could have stood the level of violence in  a movie theater.  Stone's one consistent flaw is usually weak roles for  women but not in this movie.  Cameron Diaz is the very vital yet ruthless  team owner.  She inherited the team from her father and is going to make it  work come hell or high water.  This woman lets nothing and no one stand in  her way.  I even liked Ann-Margret as her mother, who has always taken 3rd  place to football in the family.

I literally had to turn away from the  violence in chunks of the film though and I've never had to do that  watching a Stone film before, even for ""Natural Born Killers.""  Maybe because I believe football is so stupid, I just can't stomach that  anyone would do this to himself for the money alone, whereas psychopaths  enjoying killing people in ""Natural Born Killers"", makes some  sick sense, sad to say.  One example of senseless mayhem is the quarterback  played by Dennis Quaid.  He is virtually losing his vision by the end of  the movie and the rest of his body is falling apart--still in his 30s, no  less.  His wife slaps him in the face when he says he better leave football  for his health. As usual,  Stone makes the movie a multimedia event and it  is cleverly intercut throughout with every medium of expression known in  the arts, in absolutely seamless fashion.  My husband is not a football  watcher either but he adored this movie and would give it a 5, I'm sure.  If you are a big football fan, you will probably give it a 5 too.  This may  have been literally my last football game so Mr. Stone should feel  flattered.  My second last was in 1967.

You do not have to be a football fan  to enjoy this flick or the incredible acting performances of Al Pacino and  Jamie Foxx, but it will help to understand the locker room jargon if you  are. But here, Stone delivers a stimulating account of inside the NFL, and  the boys that play the game. I was very impressed with the photographic  clips of the game action, and the scintillating sound effects of the  ""noise""of the game. It told us that the violence is real, and  that boys never stop being boys when playing the game. The relationship  that grows between Pacino, the tired old coach, and Foxx, the third string  quarterback thrown into action, is brought out beautifully by Stone, who  never seems to get much credit for his work.

And it's not just about hikes  and huddles and ""big, sweaty mens"" tackling each other.  It's  also about race, age, American culture, the stuff of life in general.  Great action.  Great music.  Pacino's ""Inches"" speech is the best  macho film speech since the opening scene of Patton.  (Play it to get  yourself going Monday morning.)

The opening sequence takes us to the field  during a late-season football game which starts out ok, but after about 30  minutes of jagged film mixed with grunts and crunch sounds I found myself  thinking ""get to the point Ollie."" This movie spends WAY too much  time on style. We are presented with montage after montage of football  images past and present during important expositional scenes which are few  and far between. There are more of these excruciating collages during  character introspection which occurs way too often.

Dennis Quaid is injured within five minutes  and, I guess, we want him to return to his dominant form-though we are only  going on what they tell us.  Enter the 3rd string guy-and he starts to  shine.  His character is unlikeable and that never changes.  So when Quaid  comes back-you don't want either of them to play.

The many subplots could have been  better represented. In contrast to one of the previous reviewers, I  actually am interested in the plight of older players lied to and abused at  the risk of their very lives. It's a very intriguing idea. The problem is  that this movie didn't portray it well.
Despite all those problems I  still give this movie three stars. Why? Because it's pretty exciting,  that's why. At no point in the film was I bored and even looked at the  clock. It's a highly kinetic film based on a highly kinetic topic. I just  wish someone else had been at the helm. Perhaps someone with a bit more  football knowledge than Oliver Stone obviously has.",968803200,,1147,4.549019607843137

Oliver Stone is  a great story teller. Either with a satirical film about excessive violence  with ""Natural Born Killers"", or with one of the best movies about  The Vietnm War with ""Platoon"".  This film is about athletes, not  just football players.
The film starts out with a Steve Young kind of  character played by Dennis Quaid that gets injured, and struggles  throughout the rest of the movie to get better or retire.  Al Pacino plays  the coach that drinks to much, spends money on hookers (Elizabeth Berkley),  and distances himself from anyone that care for him.  He is the workaholic,  and old-school coach that doesn't take ""junk"" from anyone.  There  is Cameron Diaz that is the General Manager of the team.  Not a very nice  person.  Last, is Jaimie Foxx:  he does an outstanding job of playing the  rising star.  He takes the game to his head, and makes enemies.  He does a  good job playing the emotions of his character.  He was a great casting  contribution to this all-star cast.
There are a lot of quick roles  played by big time actors.
The DVD has some extra footage, most of it is  just extra nudity. Locker room scenes.  Not to graphic.  The movie contains  very explicit language.  What Stone Film doesn't.  The man can do a movie  on Elementry teachers, and every other word would be profanity. The  language is not insulting or really even unnecessary.  I mean, it's  footfall.

Although Al Pacino was very good (when is he not?) and Jamie  Foxx and Cameron Diaz were also good, the movie itself sucked.  Oliver  Stone has lost it.  Besides making one of the most mediocre movies I've  seen in a long time, he also gratuitously forced himself into several  scenes, and he even put himself on the wall of a restaurant as a  caricature, next to Al Pacino's.  Oliver gives ""ego"" a new  meaning!  He needs to take a leaf from Alfred Hitchcock's notebook on how  to maintain greatness.  Not to mention that this movie was WAYYYYYY too  long! Cut about half of the movie out (including ALL scenes with Mr. Stone)  and a watchable movie could be there though that is also questionable.",968457600,,787,4.586956521739131
1370413,2,B00004Y2R4,"Unlike ""Jerry Maguire,"" which found a way to appeal to a broad segment of  the movie going public, Oliver Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"" pretty much  requires that one be a hardcore aficionado of professional football to  really appreciate it.  Stone and co-writer John Logan deserve credit for  attempting to create a comprehensive panoramic view of the sport, warts and  all.  For example, they don't shy away from portraying the drug abuse and  shady medical practices that run rampant both in the locker room and out.  Nor do they minimize the detrimental effect that has come about as  professional football has become more and more about obscenely huge  salaries, product endorsements and individual stardom and less and less  about the values of winning and sticking together as a  team.
Unfortunately, the canvas becomes simply too broad to keep all this  profundity in focus.  For every sharp psychological insight into the people  and values that comprise this sport/industry, the film provides half a  dozen hoary clichs, stock characters and predictable plot turns that  consistently undercut those quality elements.  Al Pacino plays the typical  aging coach who, as his losing team begins to become the laughingstock of  the league, must decide whether to bow to corporate pressure and remove the  injured, aging quarterback (Dennis Quaid) or stay true to his ideals and  demonstrate loyalty to his players.  Cameron Diaz plays Pacino's major foil  as the hard-driven team owner whose only motivating factor seems to be the  Almighty Buck.  By making this character a beautiful woman, the authors get  to play it both ways:  they satisfy the feminists by showing that a woman  can be just as ruthless and cutthroat as any man in a position of  decision-making power, yet, by making her so evil, they also placate all  those men who have been smugly assuring us for years that ""professional  football is no place for a woman.""  (The filmmakers even have her cry in a  few places).  Around these two main antagonists swirl a dozen or so equally  stereotypical characters including the nefarious team doctor (James Wood,  in yet another of his one-dimensional villain roles), whose shameless  disregard for the health of the players is set in obvious counterpoint to  the righteous young intern (Matthew Modine) who is frankly shocked at this  senior doctor's cavalier indifference to the Hippocratic Oath.  LL Cool J  has a minimal and undeveloped role as a cocaine-sniffing rival to the  upstart young quarterback (Jamie Foxx) whose lack of understanding about  the role team spirit plays in a winning strategy provides much of the  driving force of the plot.  Not only does Foxx give by far and away the  finest, most intensely dramatic performance of the film, but also his  character provides the few moments of really solid insightful drama in the  entire movie.  However, so intent are Logan and Stone in providing an  upbeat ending to the film that they completely abandon the truths of this  character and send him through a 180-degree conversion that is never  adequately dramatized in the screenplay.  He simply awakens one morning a  new man, all ready to take his rightful place as a rah-rah team player.  In  fact, the neat way in which all the characters and loose plot ends somehow  resolve themselves into the happiest possible outcome contradicts the tone  of thoughtful seriousness the filmmakers have been trying to establish all  throughout the film.
This soft final section of the film is not the only  element that undercuts the verisimilitude of the story.  For some reason,  in a day and age in which Brand X has long since passed from the scene in  the world of advertising and the most minor of sports films routinely use  real life teams as focuses for their stories, Stone has opted to create not  only a fictional franchise but a fictional league as well.  Moreover,  because the team allegedly hails from Florida, the entire season seems to  be played under the glowing auspices of blazing sunshine and balmy tropical  breezes.  For a sport one associates with crisp fall weather and  bone-chilling blizzards, this entire summer-like atmosphere seems a bit  disconcerting.
As a director, Stone buries the drama under a flurry of  MTV-like stylistic flourishes.  Too cute by half, this pretentious  directorial method merely serves as a device to distance us from the  characters whose plights should be drawing us deeper into the film.  In the  middle of quietly dramatic scenes, Stone intercuts, in rapid succession,  utterly irrelevant shots of lightning storms, roiling clouds and even  snippets from the ""Ben-Hur"" chariot race (as a possible sop to Charlton  Heston who makes a cameo appearance herein?).  Similarly, the never-ending  cacophony of blaring rap tunes cluttering up the soundtrack cannot cover up  the essential emptiness of the film's characters and message.  Stone has  rarely seemed so transparent in his facile slickness.  Even the football  scenes are pumped-up beyond necessity.  Part of the beauty of the sport  lies in seeing the players' movements as all of a piece.  In the visually  fractured view that Stone accords us, he does not heighten our excitement  and involvement, but rather diminishes them.
""Any Given Sunday"" is  definitely a long haul and it does offer a few moments of effective drama  scattered along the way.  But if you are going to devote 157 minutes to the  subject of professional football, you might find that time better spent  watching the real thing.",968457600,6,5541,5.060133630289532
1370414,3,B00004Y2R4,"This movie does to football what ""Saving Private Ryan"" did to war.  ""Any Given Sunday"" puts you on field of battle and makes  you see the violence and the pain from the perspective of the participant.  The cast on paper is first rate but, other than Pacino, the acting is  mediocre.  Jim Brown is embarrassing as Pacino's defensive coordinator.  I  found the violence in the movie a bit excessive.  I watched and played  numerous games and understand the brutality of the game, but some of this  stuff reminds me of the ""Friday the 13th"" series.  The characters  are predictable and learn profound life lessons too easily.  Oliver Stone  does offer an effective ending, using a press conference during the credits  as an epilogue.
""North Dallas Forty"" still reigns as most  entertaining, realistic, and well-done movie about professional football.  ""Any Given Sunday"" steals a lot from that movie but falls far  short in its effectiveness.

Oliver Stone tries so  hard to be cutting edge and avoid playing to the  mainstream, that he fails  to realize that he IS the mainstream.  This film is a mess, with a plot  that even a six year old could have written, filled with every cliche in  the book like the aging quarterback who wants one more season, and the  brash rookie looking to take his spot.  The theme of commercialism reoccurs  throughout Any Given Sunday and just fits in perfectly with another  pointless Stone observation (i.e. Violence in the Media from Natural Born  Killers).  Yes, every modern day football fan knows that the NFL is all  about money, TV contracts, and endorsements, SO WHAT!  This movie is not a  glimpse behind the scenes into what its really like to be a football  player, its more like an old episode of HBO's 1st and Ten.  Don't even get  me started on Cameron Diaz because her casting in the film as the owner was  just plain atrocious.  Jamie Foxx is the only good thing about this film,  as he proves he can do more than just comedy.

I remember one scene with Lauren Holly and Denis Quaid that  started off promising, but then shot to a smaller screen so that some crap  could be shown, too. It hacked me off.

Stone's  goal here, is to show the audience life in the world of pro football, since  he already tackled wall street, the media, war and governmental conspiracy  (all far more successfully than here), it seems only natural that Stone  turn his cameras to the playing field. The NFL declined involvment in the  making of this film and ten minutes into it, it's not hard to understand  why.  When the team's quarterback (Dennis Quaid-underused in this film)  goes down he is screamed at and treated like a fool by the medics-any pro  football fan knows that this, right off the bat, is Stone taking liberties  in this ""real"" football story.  From here on in, this garbage  crumbles into on HUGE cliched mess.  Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz and James  Woods come off the best here, however, these great actors can't even  salvage Any Given Sunday as it turns into an R rated movie of the week with  everything AND the kitchen sink tossed in for good measure.  Between the  grinding rap music, the self indulgent and laughably inane symbolism (the  chariot racing intercut between Pacino and Jamie Foxx during an arguemnt is  absurd) we get subplot after subplot. We get Cameron Diaz's estranged  releationship with her mother, Dennis Quaid's abusive wife hits him and  tells him HE WILL NOT QUIT FOOTBALL!!!  James Woods is a snake of a medic  using a very unorthodox method of medicine on the players and so on and so  on. Stone would like to think all this interesting for the viewer, but  beyond hardcore football fans and teenagers, this movie is junk plain and  simple.  Any Given Sunday doesn't surprise the viewer once in its  proceedings, the ending is crystal clear and hour before it happens, Stone  even cops out here and throws a happy ending on the preceeding dismal 2  hours and 40 minutes. Aside from James Woods and a few funny qutotes from  his mouth, and one great shouting match between Diaz and Pacino, there is  nothing to enjoy here.

Perhaps I am just getting old and carry the burden of remembering  too many films... the bulk of this film is rehash... countless football  movies have done it better and this Oliver Stone film steals from them  all.
Just take ""North Dallas Forty"" and destroy any attempt at  forming a serious piece by punctuating each sceen with hip-hop and rap  overlays... I am sorry but I have seen several movies attempt to look fresh  or sound hip by adding rap to the score and for my money it just does not  work.
The characters in the story are one-dimensional offspring of 1000  other roles... Al Pacino is taking his overacting to new heights and gave  far better ""Win one for the Gipper"" speaches in ""Scent of a  Woman"".
Hollywood loves football but it seems that the scripts are  wearing thin... There has to be someone in a film the viewer to pull for  and in the case of this film that is not an easy task...
Oliver Stone  finally jumped on something too late... just read the papers, sports is  about money... thank's for the tip.

1370440,5,B00004Y2R4,"Undoubtedly, many will make comparisons between this motion picture and ""North Dallas Forty"".  For the most part, those comparisons will  be invalid.  The question of which of the two movies is the greatest  football team of all time would be like comparing the Green Bay Packers  teams of the 1960's to the San Francisco 49'ers teams of the 80's.  Both  pictures are great, but they provide the viewer with a snapshot of  pro-football in different eras.
""Any Given Sunday"", at almost  three hours running time, is easily Oliver Stone's best picture since  ""Born on the 4th of July"".  It stars Al Pacino as a beleagered  football coach of a losing franchise and Cameron Diaz as the MBA owner who  has inherited the team from her late father.  They both turn in fine  performances, but it is the performance of comedian Jamie Foxx as an  egotistical young quarterback that makes this all work.  Dennis Quaid is  quite effective as an aging quarterback whose injury paves the way for  Foxx's character to show his stuff.  Jim Brown is excellent as of the  team's assistant coaches and Pacino's old friend.  In addition, there are a  number of fine performances from L. L. Cool J., Lawrence Taylor, James  Woods, Matthew Modine, Clifton Davis, Ann-Margaret, and even Oliver Stone  himself.  Look for former Oklahoma and Dallas Cowboy coach Barry Switzer in  a cameo role as well as one of my favorite character actors, John C.  McGinley, as a full-of-himself football analyst.  Charlton (NRA) Heston  also briefly appears as the league commissioner.
The action in this movie  is good, and juxtaposed against the rap music background really makes it  seem almost frenetic at times, even the slo-mo shots.  Anyone thinking of  viewing this picture would do well to ignore the scathing remarks of both  Amazon.com's reviewer and of Leonard Maltin, who apparently disliked it for  reasons I can't quite figure out.

As my husband said  reflectively, about two thirds of the way through, lying next to me on our  bed, totally engrossed by this solidly directed, well acted, well written  diorama of our all american pastime, ""I could watch this all  night.""  I agreed.
There are some weak spots to this movie, without  a doubt.  Matthew Modine, for example, had most of his part end up on the  cutting room floor, I would bet.  Dennis Quaid probably did, too. I have  seen Dennis Quaid look better, by the way, in about any other  movie you  can name.  He is beginning to look more and more like his brother Randy. Oh  dear.
This imbalance in their parts in this ensemble piece is more than  made up for by another stellar performance by the incredible Al Pacino, who  just keeps getting better and better as he gets older and older.  He will  blow you away as the coach of this uneven crew of messed up players at a  critical impasse in their career as a team.  And Jamie Foxx more than meets  his challenge, playing with incredible class and finesse the young,  up(chuck) and coming athlete of the day who needs to learn the big lesson  that we stand united, or we lose.  There is a reason it's called a  ""team"". Cameron Diaz is as wicked as ""the wicked witch""  in ""Snow White"" and you just have to love her for the gusto with  which she plays this one dimensional part.
This movie is a love letter to  football, the great American pastime.  As directed by Oliver Stone, it has  a lot going for it.

This is Stone's best film since  ""Nixon."" He's usually known for political, provocative and  satirical masterpieces like ""JFK,"" ""Natural Born  Killers,"" ""Nixon"" and ""Talk Radio,"" but here he  examines the sports industry and perfectly exploits how football has become  some sort of religion in our society. He also examines the elements of the  athlete and what an athlete goes through in life. This isn't some boring  chicken job where the director is afraid to explore real issues about the  sports world and show some of it's less-popular or glamorous realities.  Stone is a director not afraid to take chances, and that's why I admire  him. In ""Any Given Sunday"" he also pumps up the volume with a  rock/rap soundtrack and bone-crunching sports sequences. He doesn't just  show us a game, he takes us INTO a game. The performances are superb as  well, especially Al Pacino who burns the screen with a fury.

Anyone who has ever been touched out at the wall, beat by the buzzer or stopped at goal knows that the margins for success can be an inch deep but a mile wide. ""Any Given Sunday"" came out in 1999, but still feels fresh thanks to both the ahead-of-its-time documentary-style camera work, and the timeless message that winning big takes big hearts, big plays, and big risks.

Oliver Stones jerky game-time camera makes you feel like you're in the huddle and running the play, and the multiple back-and-forth shots on other scenes gives the film a crazy, relentless momentum. Stone captures the ramped-up energy of the players lives  both on and off the field. Corralling that wild spirit for game day is a coachs job, though, and Al Pacino's D'Amato calls his warriors to battle for each inch in the game of football and in life.

Theres no subtle message to this film, and no heavy symbolism. The only take away: Go big or go home. Winners win. Losers lose. Inch by inch.",1519689600,3,1074,4.6421052631578945

But besides the actual movie plot, the audio is mixed horrendously! I has to ride my tv volume all 2 hours long! Too loud at half, and too soft at 100%! Ridiculous!",1518739200,,255,4.3125
