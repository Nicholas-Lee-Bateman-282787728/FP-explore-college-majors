4215132,5,B003X3BYHY,"I'm writing this before having read the other reviews. I see their 5-star ratings, an opinion I share, but know I won't be able to come close, verbally or musically, to matching their knowledgeable reviews.

That out of the way, let me say only that this fascinating, entertaining documentary should be watched by all of us who do something for the love of it, by all of us who have day jobs that pay the rent but who have dreams that pay the soul.

It doesn't matter if you don't much like the piano or classical music. This delightful documentary is about people.

The pianists are wonderful, both as musicians and as people. The director, editor and cameramen are to be applauded for bringing us a masterpiece. The Van Cliburn folks are due our inadequate gratitude for making all of this possible.

This DVD is being added to my Deserted Island list. Not sure yet whether in the movie or the music list, but no doubt it's being added.",1322870400,2,938,4.5325443786982245
4215133,5,B003X3BYHY,"If you love classical piano music this one is a must see. It has great music, exciting piano playing, features fascinating and diverse personalities, and has an excellent picture with very gratifying reproduction of the sound of a Steinway concert grand piano.

I was unaware this competition was even taking place but am very happy to see such talented musicians from all over the world given the opportunity to compete and perform. The production and direction of this documentary is beautifully done and involves the viewer in the excitement and growing tension as the competitors prepare and play. What was interesting to me was the diversity of the backgrounds and experiences exhibited by the various competitors.

The story was focused on several different pianists who would eventually move on in the competition to the semi-finals and some to the final round. They were so different it was easy to find one you liked the best; there was something for everyone. It was exciting for us when the one we picked as our favorite won the competition.

They Came to Play is fun, entertaining, and captivating; it makes for a great evening's entertainment. I recommend it highly.",1313107200,6,1179,5.005102040816326
4215134,5,B003X3BYHY,"The piano music was beautiful and the individual stories were riveting.  The suspense as to whom would be the winner made for a great story. I wish that I could give it more stars.

My big regret was that it was not longer.",1310947200,3,223,4.162790697674419
4215135,5,B003X3BYHY,"This is a very artful and yet entertaining documentary. I loved it for both the human interest stories (such a fascinating cast of characters, many of whom had gone through some real trauma in their lives), and the passionate and mostly excellent playing. It also inspired me to start practicing piano seriously again, after neglecting it for years (as many of the participants in the video also had, but they learned it's not too late to resume). The editing is really good, because sometimes interviews in documentaries can be boring, but not here. I really enjoyed also how they involved families and friends, not just the performers, because that really enriched the humanity of the film. And the bonus features (several complete pieces by the semifinalists and finalists) are also very good. Hats off the Lori Miller for this labor of love.",1307404800,9,845,4.957746478873239
4215136,5,B003X3BYHY,"Ten non-professional pianists over 35, compete in the Van Cliburn Piano Competition at Texas Christian University.  Expertly filmed,  the movie is about these amateurs who gave up music to pursue careers in business and medicine,  only to return for this intense competition. As entertaining as the piano playing is, the intimate portraits of the competitors is equally so; a Haitian American doctor, a Russian refugee, an Alabama ophthalmologist, a graduate of the Air Force Academy, an Aids sufferer, a French woman tennis instructor, an engaging and funny Moldavian woman, a jeweler with rings on his fingers,  and more.
And the winner is....",1306972800,14,645,5.294117647058823
4215137,5,B003X3BYHY,"My husband and I, both piano players, watched this documentary and loved it. So interesting to see how these performers have a full-time job and still make time to practice piano playing. Also bought this for my mom to send as a Mother's Day gift, she is a music teacher and loved it too. If you like to play the piano, this will inspire you to practice again.",1305331200,6,360,4.3088235294117645
4215138,5,B003X3BYHY,"I watched this originally on Netflix and then bought the DVD for a family member because I knew they'd love it. If you enjoy piano music, and know how hard it is to become good at it, you shoud really enjoy this.

It is amazing to see just how outstanding these amateur pianists are and how they take on this competition. I also found it very hard to discern who I would have chosen as the winner, since so many of the competitors were so good.

I highly recommend this to piano lovers.",1297555200,12,486,4.21505376344086
4215139,5,B003X3BYHY,"Brought too you by the folks who made Note by Note the building of a Steinway piano.. This DVD is just wonderful, any classical piano lover will want this in their collection, so much more so if you are learning to play.. I hope they will produce one of these each year Van Cliburn holds the competition.. well worth the purchase price...",1293321600,9,338,4.467741935483871
4215140,5,B003X3BYHY,"I have been playing piano for 35 years and I had never heard of Amateur piano competitions.  Competitions were the participants are over 35 years of age.  I saw this wonderful documentary about three months ago in Chicago and its was thrilling to see people from all walks of life playing at such a high level although piano was not their livelihood. All the participants share such a profound love and practice 4 hours a day for years in preparation.  It has now served to get me to think along the same fashion.  May 2011 is the next competition, thats too little time for this preparation but the following competition I hope to be a participant.  Thanks you for this marvelous motivating documentary.  Many will be inspired to follow their dream and challenge there talents.",1287878400,21,778,4.725925925925926

4215160,5,B003X3BYHY,"This film chronicles the Fifth International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs which is hosted by The Van Cliburn Foundation.  Players from all over the world, ranging from self-taught to classically-trained, aged thirty-five to almost eighty, convened in Fort Worth, Texas in 2007 for a week of intense competition, music and camaraderie. The film follows the contestants as they prepare for and go through the competition.  They include doctors, a dental assistant, a jeweler, a tennis coach, a physicist, all balancing their work and family with their love of music.  It is difficult to believe that these folks are amateur musicians.  I was stunned at the quality of their performances.  A fine documentary.",1436745600,,720,5.392857142857143

Some really great pianists that have been hidden from view.
All of them entertaining, some astonishing, some jaw-dropping.
I'm going to order some more for gifts.

4215166,5,B003X3BYHY,"This is a documentary of the 2007 Van Cliburn amateur piano competition in Texas.  If you love music, especially piano, you will love this DVD.  It is extremely well done, well edited, well presented.  You have a chance to get to know many of the contestants and learn about their lives outside of music.  Some are good enough to play professionally, but keep their day jobs because it is so hard to make a living playing a musical instrument.  Their stories are sometimes funny, poignant, and always interesting.  I donated my DVD to the assisted living facility where I reside, so it can be shown to the residents in our on-site theater.  The quality of the audio was absolutely wonderful in this theater; it simply blew me away.  I'm going to order another one for myself, now that I've given mine away!  Highly recommended.",1396569600,,827,4.6875
4215177,5,B003X3BYHY,"They say that amateurs make sometimes the best musicians. I am not sure this blanket statement applies to all who are portrayed in this documentary,but certainly to some. They are in it for the true love of music. I personally loved it and shed a few tears of joy! Highly recommended!",1392249600,,284,4.588235294117647
4215178,5,B003X3BYHY,Great documentary. Edited very well to bring out thrill of the event and the hearts of the participance without drowning on.,1364083200,,124,4.9523809523809526
4215179,5,B003X3BYHY,"This video makes you want to clap for joy.  Music is magic and these so called amateurs demonstrate that magic in spades as they play for joy of it.  Ordinary people, their lives, their hardships and their true love - music.  Pure delight to watch and don't miss the bonus performances !",1361923200,,287,4.480769230769231
4215180,4,B003X3BYHY,Loved seeing adults following a passion.  Loved the variety of people focused on.  Loved that I became fond of people I initially didn't care for.,1359244800,,146,4.8
4215181,5,B003X3BYHY,"I would have preferred more playing and less chit chat but I thoroughly enjoyed the process.

The movie does a good job of showing how much dedication, hard work, and sweat it takes to perform at this level.

Can't say I agree with committee's choices for winners, though. The Russian guy was technically the best player and also had great sensitivity and he didn't make top three. And no women--what's up with that?

They seemed to be going for crowd pleasers more than anything else.",1358726400,,485,4.682352941176471
4215182,5,B003X3BYHY,"It amazes me that these people all have ""day jobs"" and families, and still manage to reach such a high level of competence and artistry. Wonderful documentary. A great venue to keep music alive.",1354924800,,194,4.735294117647059
4215183,4,B003X3BYHY,"An entertaining documentary with naturally humorous characters though by the end, there is a hint that despite the opening suggestion that the competition is accessible to all amateurs, only the reputably trained can win, and that the movie is really more of a ""moc-umentary.""",1353628800,,276,5.295454545454546
4215184,5,B003X3BYHY,"This is a fascinating look into not only the Cliburn amateur piano competition but into the lives of some of the talented amateurs themselves.  Unless you have been exposed to very talented amateur pianists before, you might be surprised at how gifted and skilled the best of them really are.  A strength of this film is that you get a detailed look into the lives and background of several of the participants in the competition.  Seeing the artists in their own homes, and in many cases with their families gives this documentary a very intimate and personal feel.  The participants span a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures, and for this reason themselves make interesting subjects.  They range from true amateurs to those with extensive formal training and public performance experience, but who qualify as amateur since they don't currently make a living from performing.  As an amateur pianist myself, I was surprised that even some artists with very technically and musically advanced performances did not even make the first cut of 25!!  I also agree with another reviewer that it is difficult to see how the judges determine the prize winners.  For example, how do you decide on who is 'better', the one who pulled off an extremely difficult and long Alkan piece, or the one who gave a commanding and musically satisfying interpretation of a difficult Beethoven sonata?  Subjectivism has to enter into the judgements, it seems.  Anyway, if you are a serious amateur pianist, this is a can't miss film, and due to the human interest angle it will appeal to a much wider audience as well.",1351296000,,1601,4.896296296296296
4215185,2,B003X3BYHY,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I did not find this film entertaining or interesting. I love playing/studying piano and I enjoy watching DVD's of great masters play. I also like anyone who can play half-way decent as all of these folks can. Unfortunately, the focus is mostly on the stories behind the playing and not the actual piano playing itself. I did not find the stories that spectacular. For instance, we see people getting on planes, saying how much they wan to really win, seeing their houses and dogs (!) et al.

Most of the clips of the pieces played are only 10-30 seconds and the pieces are often not identified clearly. Just when you see their musical talent emerging, were off packing the bags! This is not to say anything against the great folks in the film, just that the premise of the amateur drive to compete in a piano competition didn't work for me.",1326067200,9,873,4.525316455696203
4215186,5,B003X3BYHY,"I realize that the title of this review might be seen by many as over the top.  Maybe I'm a 99.5% outlier.  All I can say is that when my wife and I saw this film in a community theatre, the emotion that rose up in me was overwhelming.  These are real people, not actors, that probably had something to do with it.  Not only were all of the competitors excellent musicians, but they were giving everything they had, almost every spare moment, to trying to create the most evocative performances of so many varied pieces.

The camera angles add a lot: we see the faces of several of the best performers, very closely, as their emotions change second by second, with the changes in the pieces they play.  I learned many new pieces.  For many of the performers, we get a few minutes to know their stories, before their performances.  People from all over the world, e.g. a former top tennis player in France, a retired physicist in Germany, you get to know some pivotal parts of their lives, enough to make you want to root for all of them in the competition.  I'm still in awe that I can feel so much for people who get so little time on screen.

My wife and I bought 8 DVDs that night, given to friends in Holiday season, and I arranged for 2 showings in local venues as well.

If there is any chance in the world that you might be held in awe by exceptional piano pieces played wonderfully, by people whose love for the music is obvious, this must be the next DVD you see.",1324252800,4,1472,4.277978339350181

8407674,4,B003X3BYHY,"The movie documents the amateur piano competition. It has interviews with some of the competitors and segments on the performances. The players (all amateurs above the age of 35 with day jobs to pay the bills) had compelling stories. I wish there had been a bit more about what the judges paid attention to, why the musicians picked this or that piece, whether attending the competition changed them in some ways, but the movie is full of excellent excerpts of solo piano pieces played by extremely talented pianists.",1498089600,,517,4.886363636363637

8407678,5,B003X3BYHY,"If you are an amateur pianist, this DVD is a must have.  There is hope if you secretly wanted to be a concert pianist.  The stories of everyday people following their dream is one that resonates with almost all of us.  The problem is that most of us never pursue our dreams.  Van Cliburn has made it possible for some to pursue what it would feel like to be an actual concert pianist.  The personal stories that are interwoven with the actual playing and the competition is captivating.  Never a dull moment.  I highly recommend this vide!",1470700800,,539,4.494845360824742
