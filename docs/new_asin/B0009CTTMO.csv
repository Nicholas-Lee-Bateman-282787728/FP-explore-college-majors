2276746,4,B0009CTTMO,"hey people i remember this show from when i was a kid and loved it but missed the last episodes. now that its on DVD i really want to buy it but i hate  cancelled shows so i ask, is this show complete or was it cut off on a cliffhanger? if this series is complete then im definetly buying. i might add, i started to collect the comics after watching the show but like someone said earlier, after they changed all the characters it just lost the spark to me.",1122508800,,457,4.021978021978022
2276747,5,B0009CTTMO,"So, are there obvious similarities to the X-Men?  Sure!  Was the animation sometimes suspect?  Yes!  Was there cheesy dialogue and humorous rallying cries (My favorite: Grifter's ""Full nitro!  Let's make toast!"")?  Absolutely!  But is it an animated series worth the price?  You bet!

WildC.A.T.s was different in that it had a continuing story that kept you hooked from week to week.  Only small details of ""the orb"" were revealed in each episode, so you had to keep tuning in to get the whole picture.

Also, I have to say that the romantic storyline between Grifter and Zealot had me tuning in too (Hey.  Every superhero cartoon has to have one.).  And as much as I love Cyclops and Jean, their cartoon storyline had nothing on this one (the comic is another story).  Grifter and Zealot's big moment in ""M.V.P."" is, in my opinion, one of the most romantic moments I've ever seen on television (Hope that doesn't scare the guys away from buying this.).

If you like superhero cartoons, you'll want to check this one out.",1122249600,13,1022,4.7272727272727275
2276748,2,B0009CTTMO,Be careful...i ordered this received it and it only has the 2nd disc in it.........but i enjoyed the episodes that i did watch,1121904000,,126,4.521739130434782
2276749,5,B0009CTTMO,"Holy cow this is so exciting!  I remember this cartoon from when it came on and it rocks.  At first, I did not know that it was based off of Jim Lee's ultracool Wildstorm comic book by the same name, but upon seeing how much fun this cartoon was I quickly fell in love with the comics.  Jim Lee has been arguably the most important comic artist of the last 20 years, and this TV show demonstrates why: an amazing ability to craft fun, inventive story lines with cool, original characters.  Yes, there are resemblences to Jim's early work on the X-Men, but that similarity is largely due to the fact that almost every modern superhero team owes some due to the X-Men.

This cartoon is a load of fun as are the comics and I'm so excited that they are releasing it on DVD.  Thanks!!!",1120780800,4,780,4.308219178082192
2276750,5,B0009CTTMO,It doesn't list it here.  But this DVD set has an interview with Jim Lee on it that I've heard is pretty good.  I'd picking it up just for that.  WildC.A.T.S was a great show.  I'm glad its coming out on DVD.,1120262400,,208,3.880952380952381
2276751,5,B0009CTTMO,"I remember this show from when I was a teen and I LOVED it!  These characters are NOT clones of any X-men characters.

I have issue with the concept that now that X-men exists any character who happens to be psychic is a Jean Gray clone, or any character with an attitude is therefore a Logan clone.

X-men does not have a monopoly on these types of characteristics.  If so, then every red head ever created in the future would be compared, even if she were completely different in every other way!

It's been a decade since I've seen this show, but as memory serves me they were mostly an alien race that has been here for a long time after thier craft crashed here along with another craft they were battling with.  The other race is kinda ugly and very evil and they fight them to protect man kind because they've not assimilated into our life style.  I remember that there are two couples on the show.  One of them is the big guy with the petite blue haired girl who is telekenetic.  The white haired chick and the human guy with the bandana over his face are also a semi-couple.  They were the ""will they or won't they"" couple.  They had a leader who was as I remember it a big corporate giant and who ran them as an underground group.  There is a computer/AI character who reminded me of Synergie from Jem, concept wise, but character wise compeletely different.

Ok, so those are my vague memories!  I can't wait for the DVD, it'll be great!",1119916800,,1448,4.354477611940299
2276752,5,B0009CTTMO,"First, please ignore inane comparisons of the WildCATS team to Xmen characters. The character development is actually in-and-of-itself, and is not just a cheap Xmen ripoff. I say this with conviction because I actually bought the comics from Image, and followed the series until major changes were made. (All original characters left the story, and I didn't like the new team, nor the new writing.) The original comis, and the WildCATS/Spawn crossover comics were OUTSTANDING. The TV Series stayed true to the original vision of the comic, and is definetly worth the buy!",1115078400,2,571,5.150537634408602
2276753,5,B0009CTTMO,"If you don't remember, WildC.A.T.S. was a short-lived 13-episode cartoon based on an IMAGE Comic by Jim Lee that aired between October '94 and June '95.  This franchise tried to give X-Men a run for its money, but failed to catch on.  From the few episodes I remember watching, it was a cool concept.  It even had a toy figure line as well as other merchandise.  Now that I have researched the series more, I remembered that I had a collector's card set of this comic.  Great set of cards, IIRC.

There were seven main good guy characters.  Spartan, the leader, who is kind of a clone of Cyclops.  Grifter, who is a clone of Gambit.  Zealot, who's a clone of Elektra.  Maul, who's a cross between Beast and Colossus.  Warblade, who's a clone of Shatterstar from X-Force.  Voodoo, who's a cross between Psylocke and Rogue.  And Void, who's a clone of Storm.
(My characterizations may be off, as I'm just going off of pictures of the characters and not of any memory from the show itself.)

Shame this series didn't last longer than it did, because it had great animation for the time and the heroes were probably more dynamic than some of the X-Men.

I'll be picking this set up for sure.

2276816,5,B0009CTTMO,"I used to LOVE WildC.A.T.S. when I was a kid in the 90's.  This show, based on the successful Image Comic, was about a team of beings with special abilities descended from an ancient alien race called the Kerabim.  They've been locked in battle for centuries against the evil Hellspont and his Daemonite minions.  Hellspont has his own team of mercenaries, the Troika, who are bent on destroying the WildC.A.T.S. while searching for ancient orb Hellspont is desperate to find and wield it's cosmic power.

If you like 90's X-Men, you'll LOVE WildC.A.T.S. because it's edgier and at times darker.  With the brilliance of Jim Lee at the helm, this 13 episode WildC.A.T.S. saga is one for every comic lover.  It's no wonder that Jim Lee eventually join the team at Marvel.",1470787200,,769,4.787878787878788

2276894,4,B0009CTTMO,Wildcats is one of those throwback series like Thunder Cats (though not quite as good).  Right on the edge of the fare we are now seeing with Marvel's Avengers and Justice League...this is one I can see resurrected - as long as they don't fall into the mistakes that were made with the new Thunder Cats (which started out with so much promise - but became a soap drama with no clear direction),1413849600,,393,4.383561643835616
2276895,2,B0009CTTMO,A huge disapointment. Being a fan of Jim Lee since Batman run I expected better. The art was substandard...The story line sounded like something from the 60s. Waste of money. If you want true Wild CATS ck out Lees comics.,1387670400,,221,4.55
2276896,5,B0009CTTMO,"I love Jim Lee's work and can't decide if the Wild Storm imprint merging in to the DCU was good or bad. It's nice to see Grifter in the new Justice League animated movie, but it's much better watching the whole team in action here!

This needs an HD upgrade though. The resolution is 640x480 which is low.even for 1992. Small issues like that aside,it's a great little cheesy show. Must see for fans of the comic. I have to say that I'm glad it was available at all. Thanks!",1375056000,2,474,4.266666666666667

2276899,1,B0009CTTMO,"American cartoons were kingdoms and boxes of wonderful imagination worlds for children in the 80s and the early 90s.  Pirates of Dark Water, M.A.S.K, Thundercats, Gargoyles, X-Men, Muppet Babies, and the list goes on and on.

Then in the late 90s, the quality of American cartoons all of a sudden became greatly diminished.  With the exception of a few shows (Mechwarrior, Battletech) the American animation took a turn for the worst.  It became about money over quality.  Saturday morning cartoons were killed.

Sadly, Jim Lee's Wild C.A.T.S was a perfect perpetrator of this fad.  The animation is jerky and diluted (And falls short of Jim Lee's comic book art), the storyline was horrendous, and the characterization was cardboard.

This is easily the worst cartoon series that I have seen.  Like a previous reviewer stated, I barely made it past two episodes.

I purchased this DVD in 2005 at a Suncoast Video for 8.00.  It was a cheap and an entire series.  I remembered this cartoon very vaguely as a child.  Upon watching the first video, and even the introduction (Terrible, I was very put off by the cartoon.

Image comics in the late 90s died a horrible death because of bad storytelling, plot, and characterization.  Wild Cats is a perfect example of this.",1292112000,,1267,4.882629107981221

Where are all the good shows that used to be on USA cartoons in the 90's?  Sure, if you like 90's cartoons this is a good one, but not nearly as good as Phantom 2040 or even the American Street Fighter cartoon.",1238284800,,315,4.233333333333333

2276902,1,B0009CTTMO,"Wow, I didn't even make it through two episodes. Worse than that, I wasted about $40 on the thing. Oh well, live and learn.

XMen may have been a better comic book cartoon but Wild C.A.T.S. had the better theme song.  Spartan, Grifter and Zealot were incredible but I didn't like how they family-ized Voodoo's stripper background.  Would have loved to see an appearance from Stormwatch or Gen 13 but hey, to get a full complement of episodes was wonderful to me.

This DVD release is good. Menus are not animated at all, your standard still frames but that is not a bad thing. Quality-Wise its like high-quality VHS copies were put onto the discs, Very nice, but still lacks the vibrate,Spiffy DVD-quality treatment.

2276944,2,B0009CTTMO,"Jim Lee is undoubtadly one of the most influential and revered comic artists of his time, making a name for himself with Marvel's smash X-Men titles in the late 80's/early 90's, and he continues to pencil hits today with his more recent runs on DC's Batman and Superman titles.  Wild C.A.T.S. (standing for ""Covert Action Teams"") was Lee's attempt to strike his own way with his then new imprint Wild Storm and Image (Wild Storm would be bought out by DC a few years later), and Wild C.A.T.S. attempted to be the line's flagship title.  The comic itself was average, sausage-fest, militant team action, and it tried way too hard to be edgy.  This animated series, which didn't last very long, attempted to steal Fox's hit animated X-Men series' thunder by having a cast of X-Men clones (the stalwart leader, the berserker badass, etc.) and some lame action sequences.  Not to mention, but the dialogue is attrocious and the storylines themselves are pretty incoherent.  There are a few, brief, shining moments to be found in this Wild C.A.T.S. DVD set, but very few, and the list price is unbelievably high for what all is here.  All in all, if you were a fan of the comic and/or series, check this out, but for the rest of us, let's just hope and wait for Fox's X-Men series to get season releases.",1129593600,8,1299,4.626086956521739

The characters were so textbook old school comics, like the Hellspont cackling HA HA HA after revealing his eeeeevil plan. The dialogue was so bad, i could not engage in the stories.

It really is cool for fans like me to see a more personal side of Jim Lee, not knowing his in-person personality, voice, etc when seeing his art displayed in the comics I read, I had a kick out of the interview.

If you ever get a chance to check out some of Jim Lee's comics, give it a try.  WildC.A.T.S. is just one of the great comics Lee was responsible for. No one draws as entertaining as Lee does.
