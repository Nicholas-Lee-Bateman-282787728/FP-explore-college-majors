I've gotten most of what is available in video by Fahey and this is probably my favorite performance. He was really up on his game in this period of his too short life.",1415318400,,322,4.209677419354839
8483828,5,B005QVVV0Q,"I knew John Fahey as did other friends. Some of the people in the book had been close friends like Tony Lee, whom we called the Flea. He is a composer of church music. Lost contact as John took on that California lifestyle of drugs etc. I have some of his original records and now know the musical source of his unusual sound. Always loved his guitar playing and compositions. This CD is worth buying.",1415232000,,401,4.36
8483829,4,B005QVVV0Q,"I love Fahey's music, but was distracted as were others by the 'comb over'. After a while I quit watching and just listened to the music. Didn't get the abruptly truncated interview at the end.",1409097600,,193,4.542857142857143
8483830,5,B005QVVV0Q,"This is probably the best performance video of the late great John Fahey, despite one tune being misnamed (That definitely isn't ""Take a Look at That Baby""). He was clearly at the top of his game at the time he did this concert. Well worth the money, if you are a fan of Fahey.",1395964800,,277,4.148148148148148
8483831,5,B005QVVV0Q,"Fahey is a force to be reckoned with.  Equal parts Americana Traditionalist and Avant Garde minimalist, he really is in a category of his own.  Just buy this, you will be in awe.

There are no chapter titles so just watch the whole thing everytime!  (Not a Hardship)

Here is a Haiku:

nasty combover
a genius composer
utterly spellbound",1356307200,,337,4.627118644067797
8483832,5,B005QVVV0Q,"There is nothing more to add to the previous comments, but if i have to ; he is in his best(except the hair :),  excellent sound quality as well as the video",1331683200,,157,3.90625
8483833,5,B005QVVV0Q,"This was from a time when I first began seeing John live around LA and therefore it represents a strong memory for me of his brilliance!  I thank goodness for all the video archive we have of this truly pioneering GIANT in music and while most of it comes from a couple decades after this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guitar-Artistry-of-John-Fahey/dp/B004NYYDVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guitar Artistry of John Fahey</a>&nbsp;, with rare exceptions being the tv program from even earlier, this represents truly a golden period for Fahey and this set list is top notch!  He is playing on a show in Germany Rockpalast , which is usually reserved for Rock stars which indicates his level at the time.  The film is in really good shape and his performance is very very strong!
On the sunny Side of the Ocean, Hawaiian Two step, Lion , Wine and Roses, Poor Boy Long Ways From Home, Steamboat Gwine Round the Bend, How Green was my Valley, Candy Man , Brendas blues, Take a Look at that Baby, Beverly a medley which includes I'll See You In My Dreams!  and an interview...WOW

the only negative is that there are NO chapter stops... but I dare you to stop watching anyway!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to fans and those curious!!",1322265600,9,1262,5.101941747572815
8483834,5,B005QVVV0Q,"In my opinion this is the best available John Fahey DVD released so far. He's at the height of his chops and passion on these tracks. I believe this was recorded on the same tour as the On Air CD which is also a must have. If you've seen the Rockpalast videos on YouTube then you already know. The picture and sound quality quite superior to the YouTube clips. The interview is excellent as well.
Yes there is the occasional mic feedback and its tracks are not separated.  However there are many more tunes performed than listed on the DVD. Any Fahey fan will be more than pleased. Ignore his atrocious combover and dig the well filmed work of his hands. The camera man gets lots of his fretwork and picking which certainly helps me to figure how to play the tunes. Great lap guitar work as well.
I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",1320883200,11,829,4.314102564102564
8483835,5,B005QVVV0Q,"My heart jumped when, in casual browsing over 'Fahey' I found this title. I've watched the clips from this concert -on youtube- many times. IF this new DVD does the man justice, this will be a dream come true for all lovers of Fahey and his music. [There has been just one other DVD of him 'in concert' available.] In THIS concert, at Rockpalast I believe, his playing is stunning,and his technique is precise and masterful- probably as technically perfect as he ever became. But I find his approach on several pieces to be a little too fast and technical, less nuanced than he often played. For me, Fahey reaches the emotions through the intellect, a different route from the heart-on-sleeve of much popular music. There are many gems. The youtube clips give a fine idea of what to expect, though a few are somewhat mistitled, which may be due to the source mistitling the pieces. On the youtube clips, titles appear on the screen, sometimes wrong titles. On this DVD you can expect to hear: a)his concert medley of Candyman/ Brenda's Blues/ Spanish Dance, b)his now highly evolved Approaching the Disco Void (which  began its life as Wine and Roses, got retitled The Red Pony, and finally- stark and scary, having lost the melodic sweetness of the earlier versions and become a technical tour de force- the 'void' title. c) Beverly/ Indian Pacific Railroad Blues (another retitling), d) a medley containing On The Sunny Side Of The Ocean /Spanish Two-Step. An incredible release I hope it to be!!! Also, except for perhaps one goof in having camera show his hands in sync with the music, most of the camera work is very good. Much clear viewing of his hands, from which guitarists can pick up a LOT of his fingerings and fretboard work, as I have done. The music is uninterrupted when the camera part doesn't sync properly- no worries. Also,the guitar is played into a microphone-well worth noting in this age when acoustic guitars in concert typically rely on inboard pickups which seem to make them all sound like rubber-band strung plastic. As Fahey always proved in concerts and in recording, the microphone is THE way to present the guitar sound authentically.",1319846400,5,2167,4.794117647058823
