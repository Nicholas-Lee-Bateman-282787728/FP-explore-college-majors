8081547,5,B000B5IOI4,"This is an unbelievable DVD of performances by one of the most talented singer/dancers/actresses of our time.  Yes she created the role of Maria in West Side Story, which by itself gives her legendary status. But, these television performances allowed her to stretch out and display her breath of repertory and pinpoint musical discipline during her prime dancing years. Her passion and presence in these performances is infectious.  I fell in love with this woman who as a kid I previously only remembered seeing on TV pitching General Foods International Coffee in the 1970's (is this stuff still available?).  Ms Lawrence is quite the professional and this compilation of performances will only leave you wanting to see more, as you catch your breath and utter, ""wow, what a doll.""",1275955200,2,784,5.062015503875969
