7899347,5,630587140X,Saw this years ago on HBO and it stuck in my head all these years.  The acting and action sequences were only topped by the script.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.,1348444800,,170,3.9705882352941178

7899349,3,630587140X,"It's nice to get a break from the Hollywood Blockbusters once and a while.  I read about this film in the Hollywood Reporter; this film was shot for less than a quarter of a million dollars.  That's an inde!
The film isn't  extremely unique, nor does it have the best acting of all time.  What it  does have is a group of talented people who took an idea that has been done  a million times and did it better than most in recent memory.  I stongly  believe it's under-rated.
The Director, Milloy, is definately going  somewhere--he's got talent!",963878400,3,545,4.479591836734694
