959663,2,6305015058,What's got into Stone Cold? What's the cameraman got to do with him? Matches are OK. But the presentation is yucky.,1295740800,,115,4.523809523809524
959664,5,6305015058,"This Dvd is so fun and a good laugh. Austin narrates it and makes it 10 times better. Its a quick watch about an hour but worth it! Check it out it contains language, blood and hell-raising! Thats the SOB we want. So not much else to say. This dvd is great do you know why? 'Cause stone cold said so!",1293321600,2,300,3.9344262295081966
959665,5,6305015058,"Stone Cold narrates this documentary over the years 96-97 and is much better then Hell Yeah: Stone Cold's Saga Continues, which covers the years 98-99. This is the set I was looking for and shows why I liked Austin in the first place. The only problem with the dvd is you gotta sit thru 3:02 of previews you cannot skip over. Other then that, it's a pretty good one hour overview of Austin in 96-97.",1265414400,,399,4.333333333333333

959667,5,6305015058,"This movie is awesome.. shows Mr. Austin starting out in the WWF as a heel hell-raiser, before all the injuries and politics caught up with him. He's hilarious to watch as he basically overcomes everyone with his fists and trash-talking. You can see an energy and real ""rawness"" that is not present in today's WWE. This was when they let wrestlers develop their own characters, instead of just handing them a script, and I can really tell the difference.",1173657600,,454,4.7594936708860756
959668,5,6305015058,"This video is hilarious. Especially when Austin yells at the guy for counting him down...""Don't do this...don't count me down this is my video, and if ya keep countin me down i'm gonna open up a can of whoop-ass!"" ""I aint leavin yet, and you can stop countin me down i already told youi once and i think we got a damm problem cause i aint gonna take this sh*t no more!"" and then when he yells at the security guard ""You did this didn't ya? You did this didn't ya!"" and then when he yells at the cops ""tie my shoe...TIE MY SHOE RIGHT NOW!"" and some other funny stuff like when he's beating up those random people in a swimming pool. Oh yeah and when he immitated Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan...funny stuff haha i'm laughing",1085875200,,722,4.239130434782608
959699,3,6305015058,"Contrary to what most people assume, this is not a brand-new release by the WWE. Rather, it's a 2003 re-release (on DVD) of a 1998 VHS tape of the same name. On this disc, hosted by ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin himself, you'll find highlights of his first two years in the WWE. It includes his King of the Ring 1996 transformation to the bada$$ he is today. It also highlights some of his greatest disses, ""a$$-whoopins"", and matches before late 1997. Also, it makes note of some of his greatest feuds, with the likes of Brian Pillman, Vader and Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart. If you own this original release, I don't suggest you pick it up. It is absolutely no different than the original version. If you don't have it, however, you might as well get it. It's a very good buy for the Amazon price of $9.98.",1084492800,6,798,4.398648648648648
959700,4,6305015058,"In my opinion, this is the best Stone Cold movie ever to be released. It shows a time when the Stone Cold character was just getting started. Its also comical to watch Stone Cold arguing with the police and beating up the production staff. No other movie was as good as this first one. Not Hell Yeah, Not Lord of the Ring, Not What? and Not The Stone Cold Truth. Another comical part is when u read the credits and see thats everything is done by Stone Cold. The best one is

I would recommend this movie to any fan of stone cold that never watched RAW before the Austin/McMahon saga. The only flaw is that theres no extras",1082851200,,645,4.252032520325203
959701,5,6305015058,"This is one of the best wrestling DVDs out there. If you're a Stone Cold fan, you absolutely need to own this. The Stone Cold persona featured here is the foul-mouthed, authority flippin', ""I'm gonna whoop you just for lookin' at me!"" Austin of 1996-1997. The DVD contains his rise to fame, starting from the 1996 King of the Ring, and ending at the aftermaths of his WrestleMania 13 match with Bret Hart -- all of which is narrated with a hilarious commentary by the man himself. If you enjoy Stone Cold Steve Austin even a little bit, then you need to get this disc, no questions asked. Oh, and remember to watch for the credits...!",1082073600,,634,4.474137931034483

959704,2,6305015058,"First of all, if you're thinking that this is a new release, think again. This is a re-release of Austin's first video release that first went on the market in late '97. While this is a really good package that looks at Stone Cold's first year in the WWF, it's nothing new.
But at least there's extras, right? Wrong again!
All they did was take the origional video and throw it on DVD. Nothing has changed.
So if you haven't seen it, then go ahead, you'll likely enjoy it. But if you were looking for something new, I would recomend checking out Austin's previous release ""What?"", it's more current.",1077148800,,599,4.504587155963303
959705,3,6305015058,"Compared to its sister release this month along with the horrible rushed put whatever Undertaker : He Buries them Alive its Cause' Stone Cold Said So. I really found this sixty minute video quite entertaining actually. Pretty great stuff before Owen broke his neck, so he is capable to work an awesome match plus he was really determined in his promos rising to the top. The problem I have is that there is no extra features which does not really make any sense since it is a Digital Video Disc. Nonetheless it's a quite entertaining watch. By the way Hell Yeah and What? or some good Austin videos as well.",1075939200,,607,4.527272727272727

959707,5,6305015058,"This video is definitely my favorite of all WWF videos, and with the Austin interviews and explanations, fans can really understand what 3:16 is all about. Having seen Austin 3:16 the video, I thought this might have  repeated a bit but the I Quit match with the Hitman really showed me that  Austin is The Best There Is...etc.",944870400,,327,4.620689655172414
959718,5,6305015058,"I believe that this is the best video of an wrestling superstar such as Steve Austin. The way he explained why he had to whip people and what his legendary sentiment,""Austin 3:16""means. This video will  blow Stone Cold fans away!!",928108800,,230,4.75

7882058,5,6305015058,"I only watched a few minutes so far of this DVD, as it just arrived in the mail. But so far I'm laughing and I am impressed with this DVD. Stone Cold Steve Austin hosts his own DVD in this, and there are a variety of chapters, like ""can of whoop a**"" that shows him beating the crap out of various people. There's one where he throws a guy into a kiddie pool. I laughed so hard! He even yelled at the camera guy for ""counting me out!"" and then grabbed him and threw him.

He's in full-on character mode as Stone Cold, sounding so tough and angry while hosting that I'm convinced if I were to walk in during this taping I would've gotten a can of whoop a** opened on me!

This is the Stone Cold Steve Austin that I grew to love in the late 90s (this video was made in 1998) and this is why I became a fan. The man was never afraid to stand up to his boss.

If you're a Stone Cold fan, this is a must have. I bought mine used and it arrived in excellent condition. If you can find a used DVD in ""very good"" condition go for it. Also the price was decent too, and I got a DVD I will enjoy for years to come!

Just one warning to those with children though, none of the profanity is bleeped out. There's no censorship at all.

Overall: Definitely worth purchasing. Five stars for my beloved wrestler!",1312934400,,1296,4.027237354085603
7882059,5,6305015058,"WWE claims that he's the highest grossing & biggest superstar in the history of their company but he had to start somewhere & that's what this tape is about.  This is the first tape WWE released on Stone Cold Steve Austin & it was history in itself as this tape showcased the beginning of WWE focusing towards the ""Attitude Era"" with it being the first ever tape WWE released that had a TV-M rating which meant that this was completely uncensored when it came to language & some of the footage as Austin personally hosted the video himself.

The video begins with the story behind how ""Austin 3:16"" was born with highlights from both of his matches from the King Of The Ring tournament in 1996 & the infamous speech afterwords.  Footage of the various verbal & physical confrontations he's had with various talents were shown before we see footage of Austin from his days in the original ECW promotion with his impressions & comments towards the then-champions of Sandman & Mikey Whipwreck.  His issues with Brian Pillman are shown next from breaking his ankle to the controversial home invasion followed by highlights of what Austin himself describes as ""opening a can of whoop-ass!"" & highlights of his participation in the 1997 Royal Rumble.  The biggest highlight of the tape comes here as Austin goes into his feud with Bret Hart starting from the various times he called him out to footage, their first encounter at Survivor Series '96, and Austin injuring Bret Hart on RAW with a special treat of getting the complete submission match from WrestleMania 13.  Footage from his title match against Undertaker at ""Cold Day In Hell"", feud with the Hart Foundation, and how that evolved into his tag team championship partnership & King Of The King with Shawn Michaels close out the documentary with the closing credits further pushing the idea that this was HIS video.

Matches Include:
Submission Match w/Ken Shamrock as the referee vs. Bret Hart - Just knowing how physical & intense this feud was for the previous months, you got exactly what you expected here in that this was just an all out brawl that went from in the ring to ringside & through the crowd with these men using anything they can get their hands on (ringpost & guardrail & steel steps & ringbell & cables) to just beat the living hell out of each other to the point where Austin was heavily bleeding. Bret Hart did try to focus on Austin's knee with moves like the figure four on the post while other submissions were tried like a combination of a arm bar & head scissors, and boston crab. This match is a classic & memorable for so many things such as it launched Austin that launched Austin from a superstar to a main event talent, the beginning of the most unique heel turn in wrestling history with Bret Hart, and the highlight image of Austin fighting out of the Sharpshooter with the blood just pouring down from his face. It should be noted that the entrances from Bret & Shamrock along with their confrontation after the match wasn't shown.

This definitely was a good showcase of Austin's breakout year.  WWE has since released this again onto DVD & I haven't seen that version but if it's anything like what WWE did to with the DVD release of the original D-Generation X tape then it was heavily toned down & censored so you don't really get the full impact that this tape originally had so for those reasons, I would recommend the VHS tape over the DVD.",1302134400,2,3437,4.639802631578948
