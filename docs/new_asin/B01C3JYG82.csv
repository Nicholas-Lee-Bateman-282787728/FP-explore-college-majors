8752123,5,B01C3JYG82,"Come on...who doesn't love Underdog. ...great, short TV series that every kid likes and gets sucked into. Used this to entertain the kids on portable dvd player while on road trip and was a big hit. Replayed it 3 times on one road trip alone. Good investment for kids entertainment.",1516924800,,282,4.66
