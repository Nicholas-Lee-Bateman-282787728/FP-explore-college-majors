Someone knows that this is a problem, you think? Ron Fleming",1328745600,,246,5.024390243902439
3867795,3,B0027ISJ1U,"I am not convinced that this is region free.  The description states that it is actually region B for Great Britain, the USA is region A.

I was able to play Movie 3, which is on a separate disk, no problem.  Movies 1 and 2, were more difficult.  The menu will not load each time.  If I reload it enough times, or hit stop and play for roughly a half hour while I do other things, it will start.

You can then play Movie 1.  Movie 2 will not play for me.  You can hear the sound, but it is blank.  Since I bought this, in particular, to try to get Movie 2 on Blu-ray, this is a little disturbing.  Off I go to buy Movie 1 and 2 for region A.",1316044800,2,641,3.787878787878788
3867796,5,B0027ISJ1U,"As described in the title, this item IS what you are looking for. I have read other reviews for ""The Butterfly Effect"" blu ray and noticed the one major flaw in this release, the original theatrical ending was not in the film. Personnally, I think that's a complete rip off. But ""The Butterfly Effect Trilogy"" on blu ray does have the original endings in all three of the films (I didn't say theatrical because 2 & 3 were not released to theaters).

A little side note, I own a PS3 and a laptop with a blu ray player. When I tried to play the discs on the PS3, it would NOT play, but the discs WOULD play on the laptop. I don't know the reason why it wouldn't play on the PS3. I have not tried any other blu ray players because I only own those two.

Yes it is true, Region Free means Region Free.

If you did enjoy ""The Butterfly Effect"" and are looking to expand your collection, or convert from DVD to blu ray like me. This is the item you WILL NOT regret to purchase.",1309046400,10,971,4.126984126984127

8354823,4,B0027ISJ1U,"Loving the trilogy, I immediately bought this trilogy set because...why not?! My only warning is to beware of what device you try to play the discs on. I watch all of my blu-rays on my PS 3 but the first disc that contains movies 1 & 2 will not get to the title screen. But on a regular Blu Ray player it does, and for that reason I am happy that I made this purchase.",1378252800,,368,3.92

8354825,5,B0027ISJ1U,I could't be happier with these discs they work great for me. Maybe I have one of the special blu ray players that play PAL discs. BTW the first movie is incredibly awesome! The other 2 are ok.,1349827200,,193,4.105263157894737

8354827,2,B0027ISJ1U,Make sure you read the reviews before buying and it's not about the region the first disc does not show the main menu which contains the first two movies the second disc works perfect. This ain't no trilogy to me lol,1345507200,,216,4.2926829268292686
8354828,4,B0027ISJ1U,"The Butterfly Effect trilogy is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I'm grateful to own this collection, but there are some technical details that I think everyone (especially US customers) ought to know before buying...

It's true: these discs are region-free!  That being said, it is important to note that the film select menu on the first disc is 1080i50 (PAL), which means blu-ray players that do not support the PAL format will probably not play the disc menu properly.  But have no fear!  If your blu-ray player or TV does not support the PAL format and you hear audio only when you insert the disc, you can bypass the menu by pressing ENTER or PLAY on your remote, and the first film should begin playing without issue.

The first film is encoded at the proper frame rate of 23.976fps in 1080p HD [1.85:1], and it is the theatrical cut (which is the superior version, in my opinion).  Inexplicably, however, the audio for the first film is slightly ""pitched-up"".  Typically, pitched-up audio is the result of the PAL speedup process (which is what occurs when a 24fps film is converted to 25fps), but since this movie plays at 23.976fps, one can only assume that the movie was once converted to PAL and then back to NTSC without the proper pitch adjustment.  Whatever the cause, the music and dialogue may sound slightly ""higher"" to some alert viewers, but most people probably won't notice.

The second film is encoded in 1080i HD @25fps [1.85:1], which (just like the film select menu) may not play on blu-ray players that lack PAL support.  Also, because this film is in PAL format, it suffers from PAL speedup, which affects both the audio and video, in this case.  Again, most viewers may not notice, but some might.

Finally, the third film is properly encoded with a 23.976fps frame rate in 1080p HD [1.85:1*].  And thankfully, the menu screen should not cause problems for non-PAL players, since (unlike the other disc) is was encoded at 23.976fps.  Also, the audio track does not suffer from PAL speedup, making this the only film in the collection with the correct audio pitch.  This film, however, has a different technical flaw - the aspect ratio of the film has been changed from 2.40:1 to 1.85:1.  Comparing frames from both the DVD version and the blu-ray version from this set, I can confirm that this version shows MORE on the top and bottom of the frame, and LESS on the sides of the frame than the DVD.

Overall, I believe that this is a very good set for anyone who wishes to own The Butterfly Effect Trilogy on blu-ray... particularly because the third film is not currently available for individual sale on blu-ray in the US, and this set of all three films costs little more than one would pay for just one of the films on blu-ray alone.  As long as you've got a blu-ray player that supports the frame rate (and you're okay with the technical flaws), this set is a great value.",1342137600,2,2903,4.625730994152047
