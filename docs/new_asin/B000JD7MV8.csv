This is titled ""Classic President Harry S Truman Films DVD: 1945 - 1965 Harry S. Truman Films & Newsreels During WWI"" but it doesn't even come close to living up to it's name.  Film clips of dogs walking up stairs, children at the beach, 2 commercials to elect IKE in 1956 and even a cartoon about how our government works somewhat akin to the old chestnut ""How a bill becomes a law"" that we watched in the third grade.  If you are a Harry Truman fan and want to see and here Newsreel footage of his public service this is NOT the film. These are the clips that a quality film house threw in the garbage dumpster and these guys found it.",1330300800,,743,4.2785714285714285
