8377230,5,B002PQ7JRY,"This is the definitive Mayhem documentary. Fortunately for me, I watched this video for free, it's
on YouTube.com. Great interviews, just an awesome piece of the masters of the second wave of Blackmetal.",1392508800,,203,5.181818181818182
8377231,5,B002PQ7JRY,"Loved it to bits, esp. Atilla's interview bits. Pity the live clips are incomplete one-angle camcorder affairs but the interviews are priceless. However this dvd is very expensive considering you usually don't watch documentaries as often as misc dvds and I could have used subtitles. But for those of you who are heavily into Mayhem this is a mandatory buy.",1356307200,2,358,4.983333333333333
8377232,1,B002PQ7JRY,"Music is not Mayhem, video is the same one that is on youtube with mostly former members (besides Necrobutcher) commenting on the bands origin and past. A lot of money for nothing. Not recommended.",1322611200,5,197,4.823529411764706
8377233,5,B002PQ7JRY,I've been a huge Mayhem fan for years. This dvd is how you would want to hear the story...from the band. Awesome pictures and an evil feel fills this dvd. A must for a true Mayhem fan!,1268524800,5,184,4.0
