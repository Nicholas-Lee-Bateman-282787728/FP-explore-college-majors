1068920,5,6305668205,"This movie was great. In the first of the three episodes Goku throw the Spirit Bomb, his most powerful attack. It's fun to see that. In the next episode in the video, you get to see Goku go Super Saiyan! This is really  cool, and fun to watch. Lastly, the final episode of the video you get to  see Super Saiyan Goku in action (well, a little), but it's still awesome.

1069237,5,6305668205,The transformation of Goku into a Super Saiyan is my favorite part in the whole series.  I don't know how to describe the feeling.  You really have to see the whole saga because it leads up to this very moment and you'll appreciate it a lot more.  There's lots of extras and a pretty good menu.  I really don't reccomend this unless you've already seen these episodes or you've seen the episodes leading up to it.,1006387200,,413,4.394736842105263
1069238,5,6305668205,"This DBZ DVD contains the transformation of Goku into a Super Saiya-jin to defeat the conqueror of worlds, Frieza.  Spoiler ahead:  Frieza has survived Goku's Genki-dama and takes out Piccolo and kills Krillin.  The loss of Goku's life-long friend is the final thread to give him desperation enough to make the transformation into a Super Saiya-jin.  This scene is one of the best in the entire anime.  His power level shoots from 2 million to 20 million in an instant.  He warns Gohan to leave the planet, and take the injured Piccolo with him, for he now has so much power that he does not yet have full control.  While Frieza is at only 12 million, he has experience with such power, and still holds an advantage.  And so begins the final battle between Frieza and Goku.",996710400,13,773,4.591240875912408

This is the first time in the series anyone has ever become a Super Saiyan.  Though it would have been better to include this special moment in a DBZ movie, it is still THE BEST Dragonball Z episode collection ever!  Even if you're not a DBZ fan, buy this!  You won't regret it!  (I only wish they had this episode on DVD...  Sadly, it hasn't been released on DVD.)",974937600,4,517,4.494623655913978

Viewers get to see the true power of Goku's spirit bomb, aswell as a short  but cool fight between Frieza and Piccolo. The action intensifies when  Frieza reappears and finishes off Piccolo and destroys Krillin! Then,  suddenly, in a wild and very awesome surge of anger our hero, Goku,  transforms into a Super Saiyan!  The fight between the stunned Frieza and  the golden-haired Goku is truly awesome, with some must-see action in the  last episode on the video.

I ordered it on here and it came on time and was obviously brand new when it was shipped. BUT... the postal service dropped it in delivery and broke the corner off of it and it will not longer open the head and play.

This was due entirely to the incompetence of the US Post Office and I won't hold you responsible so I will be reordering rather than getting a refund for you and instead those morons at the USPS will be paying me the difference.",1388880000,,555,4.186915887850467
