7481474,5,B016ZGYFE4,Whoaaa...this was MIND BLOWING! It is based on a true story about a girl who was relentlessly bullied at school and couldn't take it any more. She and her friend filmed the bullying before she tried to take her own life. THIS SHOULD BE COMPULSORY in every school without preaching. I DARE you to not be floored!!!,1453420800,3,313,4.508771929824562
7481475,5,B016ZGYFE4,"Will no one ever hold the spineless followers of the bully accountable??  I'm just saying, every movie portrays them as either victims or in the background as indifferent characters but they are the fuel of which a bully's fire feeds from.  If you ignore them, then you open the position in their clique to a new bully, never ending the cycle and in fact feeding it to be passed on to another.",1453334400,11,393,4.444444444444445
7481476,5,B016ZGYFE4,"Okay, although I'm a bonafide movie buyer and buff - I never write reviews as I've learned over the years that just because a movie gets 3 or 4 stars (or even 5 in some cases), it doesn't necessarily make them good.  I couldn't help but leave a review for this movie.  It just ended and I literally have tears in my eyes.  This movie makes any adult feel like yanking every child aside and personally tying them to a chair making them watch this movie while hoping it has the same impact on them that it had on you. I must admit, I had a difficult time feeling sorry for the student that was actually doing the bullying. I'd really like to know what kind of legal consequences come with a situation like this (whether the victim lives or not) - if there aren't any, there most certainly should be.  This movie was real, it was sad, it was powerful and made you love and want to strangle at the same time.  Please watch it, teenagers should watch it.....it all starts with the parents.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.",1453161600,75,1031,4.288659793814433
7481477,5,B016ZGYFE4,"One of the most powerful films about the subject I've ever seen. Gut wrenching and truthful.  The three main characters, Avery,  Jessica and Brian (Hunter King, Lexi Ainsworth and Jimmy Bennett) bring such reality to the film.  An emotional roller-coaster from start to finish.",1451865600,2,277,5.25
7481478,5,B016ZGYFE4,"You'll need a strong stomach for this movie.
Oh, there's no violence or gore in writer-director Amy S. Weber's exploration of the world of girl-on-girl victimization -- unless you count the intense emotional wounds that the heroine, high school sophomore Jessica Burns (Lexi Ainsworth) suffers at the claws of her tormentor, Avery Keller (Hunter King), and her posse of popular girls.
A Girl Like Her is genuinely harrowing by virtue of its realistic portrayal of the social pressures that weigh on teens and of the herd mentality that impels them to become passive accomplices in bullying. Weber's second feature is a revelatory study of the psychology of victim and perpetrator alike.
Think of it as Mean Girls, but with brains. And heart. And true social conscience.
Weber (Annabelle & Bear) makes smart choices here, not least of which is to frame A Girl Like Her as a faux documentary, injecting a much-needed ironic distance between the action and the viewer. We get to experience the full emotional weight of the story without being enveloped in the warm comforts of sentiment alone. A fine piece of social critique, A Girl Like Her leaves us disturbed, irritated, angry. It motivates.
The story opens with news that Jessica and Avery's public high school has been ranked 10th best in the country, piquing the interest of documentary filmmaker Amy Gallagher (director Weber in a most unobtrusive cameo). Given full access to the school, Amy and her crew arrive to find one of the sophomores is in critical condition after a suicide attempt.
Through a nicely edited series of on-camera interviews with students and staff, Amy pieces together Jessica's story: For six months, the 16-year-old has been the target of an intense campaign of terror devised by Avery.
Ainsworth, 22 (Chosen, General Hospital), is wonderful as Jessica, a bright, friendly, fully engaged girl who comes across as anything but a typical victim.
Once a close friend, Avery is rich, beautiful, and immensely popular, and she brushes off mounting rumors that she's to blame for Jessica's plunge into depression. That is, until Jessica's best friend, Brian (Jimmy Bennett), gives the film crew hundreds of hours of spy-cam footage that captured the bullying.
The footage is heartbreaking.
A Girl Like Her takes another smart and surprising turn not only by engaging with Jessica's story, but also by exploring deeply and effectively Avery's circumstances and her inner life.
Unlike so much of what passes for social commentary, Weber's film is an honest reflection of a social ill, not a fantasy that lets us off the hook by offering easy, fanciful solutions.
It won't let you walk away unscathed.",1450742400,21,2673,5.077272727272727
7481479,5,B016ZGYFE4,One of the better lifetime movies,1503446400,,33,4.666666666666667
7481480,5,B016ZGYFE4,Well done. Views as a real documentary. A must for any one trying to convey the consequences of bullying.,1501545600,,105,4.578947368421052
7481481,5,B016ZGYFE4,"I hate to give this movie an ""I love it"" rating because I didn't LOVE this movie, but I would give it 5 stars.

I watched this movie, and I had to take a bit to process the message, and the affect. It's a hard movie to watch, but I highly recommend it for any parent--especially if your kids are entering junior high and high school. (I would even recommend that they watch it with you.)

There is a dialogue that all parents need to have with their children and feel safe about it. Especially in this day-in-age, and this movie really touches on it. It's a docu-drama. The actors are portraying a situation, but not a situation that is uncommon.

I do not have children of my own, but I think that we can all relate to this movie on some level. I reflected on how I treated some people through primary school and high school, and I am not proud, and profoundly apologetic. I also reflected on times that I was on the receiving end, and how I dealt with that.

This is really an important film. Watch it through the credits.",1499644800,,1024,4.262886597938144
7481482,5,B016ZGYFE4,I think this movie/documentary really explores the topic of bullying and the effects it has on people. I cried during the movie.,1499558400,,128,4.863636363636363
7481483,5,B016ZGYFE4,"It's hard to watch and sounds like so many generic bullying documentaries but IT IS NOT! They actually took the time to capture the point of view of the bully, without judgment which is crucial in identifying just how easy kids can become a bully or a victim. It is very sad but there is much to be learned from watching this, including when to protect your friends and when to speak up.",1499385600,,387,4.315068493150685
7481484,3,B016ZGYFE4,It was an okay movie. Seemed a little extreme but teaches a good lesson about how you need to act towards other people.,1494288000,,119,4.217391304347826

7481486,5,B016ZGYFE4,You have to get passed the beginning. It is set up like a documentary but such a good movie. Great product from the library but hey I am not complaining. I can actually say it works without any issues and I am very pleased.,1493164800,,223,4.090909090909091
7481487,5,B016ZGYFE4,"This movie could not be more accurate on how any high school is. I see this kind of stuff in school everyday, people bullying other people. The schools do not do absolutely anything about this. All schools care about is getting kids in and out of there in a certain amount of time. They do not take time to help kids in need who are being bullied. Someone has to kill their self or attempt to kill their self before anybody in the school listens. I think any parent, high school student, teacher, and school staff needs to see this movie. This movie is about as truthful as it gets with how High school is and how constantly bullying someone can cause them to end it all.",1490400000,,671,4.291338582677166
7481488,4,B016ZGYFE4,Good film about bullying and harassment and a must-see for anyone in school. I recommend this film for its performances and message. The extras on the DVD were also good. You will love the ending.,1488758400,,196,4.628571428571429
7481489,5,B016ZGYFE4,"I just watched this film thinking that it was a documentary; I seriously had no idea it was a film with script and actors until the end. Knowing now that it was a fictional pic I can see how I was manipulated and how the format was intended to set up an unlikely view of both sides of the bullying dynamic. And yet I come away blown away. Blown away by the realism of the topic (I know girls who have experienced both sides) and by the acting and amazing videography and editing. Yes, Ms. Weber is trying to make a powerful point, but the point is, She did! Bullying happens. It's brutal. It can be dehumanizing and soul-sucking and the bully is probably as damaged psychologically as the victim. This was an incredibly powerful film. A film that I applaud, laud, and recommend to everyone that calls themselves civilized and human. We don't need to be this way.",1487635200,,862,4.427672955974843

7481492,5,B016ZGYFE4,"This is definitely a must see. I watched it one day when I was bored and let me tell you, I cried (more than once). And then a few weeks ago my 10 year old daughter was telling me about some of the things that her friends say to other girls at school so I made her watch it. She was crying as bad as I was before the end of it. I used it as a way to start a conversation about bullying and what bullying can lead to.",1484179200,,416,3.6333333333333333
7481493,4,B016ZGYFE4,a great story about bullying told from different view points. The antagonist definitely makes you want to jump on screen and knock the mess out of her.  Overall good movie.

7481496,5,B016ZGYFE4,"I've recommended this video to many people.  It shows in specific and emotional detail how girls -- and adult women, too - operate to bully and mob others. There is a serious bullying and mobbing problem, mostly by women, in apartment buildings for senior people, and this movie is an eye opener.  Missouri and another state have recently passed strictly enforced laws to protect seniors in apartment buildings.",1482019200,,411,5.029411764705882

My husband was bored to death and got on his phone to play motorcycle racing games, but I guess I didn't really expect him to watch it with me anyways. I was bullied in school bad, so could really relate to this movie.",1480032000,,259,4.098039215686274
7481498,4,B016ZGYFE4,"Have to agree with other reviewers. Almost documentary style, well acted, protagonists well cast, very impotent topic of school bullying among girls. Two important factors which the filmmaker addressed...the life from the perspective of the popular abuser and the taboo among most kids against being a ""snitch"". Another epiphany is that it can happen in a well reputed school and the parents clueless to more subtle signs.
It's been promoted and used in schools because of the pervasiveness of this phenomena. I would have given it 5 stars but
there were some less than realistic moments.
Still, a surprisingly important film.",1479254400,,626,5.207920792079208

7481507,3,B016ZGYFE4,"This is an extremely important story that should be shown to all pre-teens and teens -- and followed by a discussion about what their options are if they are bullied.

But it bothered me that the bully was depicted at the end in such a sympathetic light.  Poor thing: Her parents argue a lot and her mother is pushy and obnoxious, so of course she had no other way to cope with the pain!  But see, she really is a good person and is so heartsick over what she did!

Sorry, I just don't buy it. The understanding that bullies become bullies because they've been bullied - and that they need help to deal with their own pain - matches the profile of bullies I've had the misfortune to encounter.  But the belief that they aren't really mean at heart - and that they feel regret for their actions - does not.  The scene in the principal's office in which the bully's brushes off the seriousness of her actions and blames the outcome on her victim is a much more realistic profile than the scene in which she's heartsick over how she's behaved.

Furthermore, it's a shame that no consequences for the bully  - other than losing friends - were written into the script.  But probably in real life even that much doesn't usually occur, so I guess the story is realistic in that way.

Finally, I wish some focus has been placed on the bully's friends, who consistently cheered her on as she bullied her victim, but then sided against the bully to save themselves when the heat was on.",1473033600,,1476,4.413284132841328
7481508,5,B016ZGYFE4,Amazing film about bullying and its consequences for both the victim and bully. Made me cry. It should be shown every year to every grade in every school in the US.,1472860800,,164,4.32258064516129

Bullying is getting out of control, there are more young people committing suicide when it is not their time to go. This movie must be watched by MIDDLE SCHOOLERS and some high schoolers.

7481545,1,B016ZGYFE4,"****SPOILER ALERT****

In a nutshell, this is a movie made to look like a documentary about a girl who tries to commit suicide after months of being severely bullied by a former friend.

While the premise for this movie - which is to show both sides of the story, namely both from the bully and her victim's perspective - is a laudable one, the movie fails in its execution on so, so many levels. Leaving aside the fact that, personally, I think it's stupid to make a movie in a documentary style - replete with constant camera shaking - this project leaves much to be desired for whatever impact it might or should have.

First of all, the fact that the movie - for all its attempted emotional turmoil - still concludes with a ""happy"" ending and the bully not only showing remorse but seeing the error of her ways is, quite frankly, ridiculous. This is a completely unlikely outcome in the very real, very much ongoing problem with bullying in not just high schools but middle schools all across the country. The fact that the bullied girl ends up in a coma, then crashes, then wakes up the same day? It would be laughable if it wasn't such an affront to any rational human being for downplaying the seriousness and severity of the consequences of attempted suicide.

Secondly, it also fails to give a true measure of just how little is being done to actually instate AND enforce a zero tolerance policy when it comes to bullying. The teachers portrayed in this movie are borderline apathetic and indifferent, yet then attend a vigil that flies in the face of the fact that NO ONE did anything for the fictional victim while the bullying was actually happening. And this is really, truly, the problem with bullying in the first place.

Lastly, and this was for me perhaps even more aggravating than the entire movie itself - which is saying something - I was, frankly, nothing short of appalled that, at the very end of the movie, the idiots who produced it didn't think to include a statement about how, while this movie was fiction, it's something that actually happens; didn't include links to suicide prevention, teen hotlines, anti-bullying websites and other social media that could actually help someone. No, the self-righteous people who made this epic fail of a faux-documentary provided only a link to a website for anyone who wants to know what happens next to the FAKE, fictional people in the story. Which is absolutely ZERO help for a kid who might watch this and identify with it.

In sum, while the concept for this movie is well worth revisiting, I feel that the approach taken here makes a mockery of the reality of bullying. It fails to truly capture the reality of bullying, tries to tie everything up in a neat little bow at the end of it so you don't feel too bad or hopeless - the perfect recipe to make people think ""see, things aren't THAT bad"" - when they really are that bad. FAIL!",1464220800,4,2909,4.584615384615384
7481546,1,B016ZGYFE4,"I didn't even finished watching it for the clichs were way too obvious; like the typical popular, blonde bully wearing her pink clothes and hanging out with her bitchy squad. I think it's an emotional manipulative ""documentary"", intended to look like a real life situation and I mean, if people want to make helpful movies and create awareness, well then get to the real places where the real situation is taking place and expose how pathetically some schools and legislation can handle a problem like bullying. It's absurd how unprotected can children and their families be. These days the victims might go to jail while the stupid party thinks we should be tolerant to the poor bully who might just have some sort of Asperger disorder...",1464134400,,739,4.873015873015873

7481548,5,B016ZGYFE4,"I don't usually review movies. I just think that reviewing movies is always based on people's experiences and that the stars that you put up for a movie don't always show how the movie actually is from one person to the next.
However, with this particular movie, I had to review it because it hits so close to home for me. I was bullied in high school, and I got to points in which I came close to taking my own life because of the bullying. This movie displays exactly what I felt during that time and the why's and the how's of it all. This movie is so incredibly powerful and moving, and not watching it would be a shame. Kids in high school and in middle school, heck even kids in elementary school should be sat down and have to watch this. Maybe it would hit close to the hearts of bullies everywhere, maybe some bullying would stop. It is so real, that you can't help but feel like you were in that high school with Jessica, and you can't help yourself and you want to scream at the bully to stop, or if you're like me, to finally fight back for someone else.
I do have some criticisms. Like how long it takes to hear from the bully. By the time they actually got to her side, I didn't really care what she had to say anymore. I just didn't care about her, because all of my heart was to her being such a terrible human being. However, when you do hear from her you kind of see that she's not a monster, she's just a teenage girl that is being bullied herself and is the classic type of person who bullies, that the people who are hurting hurt others.
All in all, this movie was perfect. Yes, there were some things here and there, but mostly it was a great movie. One that should be watched by a lot of people, to help end bullying.",1463788800,3,1740,4.135693215339233

7481550,5,B016ZGYFE4,"I watched this movie on my Apple TV.  It is set up like a documentary and does a wonderful job of making it realistic.  Without giving away too much of the movie, it is about bullying. What I really liked about this movie is that it gives a perspective from both sides.  After the bully sees what she looks like when tormenting the victim, she cries.  I work with a lot of teenagers and I ordered this movie to share it with them. Bullying is so rampant in all of our schools that anything to prevent It is worth the effort. While many schools have a zero tolerance policy, many of these incidents are not reported due to fear on the victim side.  What would the bully or do to them if they were reported.  Many times teachers know what's going on but are afraid to intervene for the same reason. They are afraid of what would be done to the victim. We have got to stop letting these children run the schools.  Well zero tolerance is a novel idea, maybe a one warning would be more realistic.  Of course the bully is pretty and popular and has several friends surrounding her at all times. Whereas the victim, has one friend.  Another realistic spin on this is that the bully and the victim were friends for many years before the drama of high school started.

I highly recommend it to any parent (especially of kids in Middle School and up) and I think it is a good one to watch WITH your child to help open up a dialog on the topic as I think it is one EVERY PARENT should discuss with their children and address if we are ever going to make things better for kids in this area.

7481621,3,B016ZGYFE4,"There are some very scary, and poignant moments in this film. Any one that has ever experienced being bullied can certainly recognize a lot of the behavior on both sides of this story. What I would have liked to have seen *potential spoilers!!!* would be consequences for the actions of these girls. Both for the bullying and the suicide attempt so that viewers could truly understand the seriousness of their choices. I thought the end was too easy, honestly. What consequences does the bully face? What consequence does the girl face as a result of her suicide attempt? Perhaps that would be an additional deterrent for both of these things and a more complete story.",1454025600,4,669,4.826086956521739
7481622,5,B016ZGYFE4,"I have wanted to watch this movie for about a year and a half now. This movie at the beginning didn't appeal to me because of the documentary type showing, but it turned out to be amazing. It really hits home for me because I was bullied when I was in sixth grade. I went to a Catholic school where my parents thought that id get a great education and meet some friends that were just like me. But that wasn't really the case. At the end of sixth grade it got really bad. I had everyone in my class turn on me. I remember one day I had enough and left school. To this day I remember sitting in the car crying with my mom. She told me I never had to go back there and that I would be switching to Public School for my seventh grade year. Around this time I had watched the American Girl movie ""Chrissa"". In the movie she was bullied and left school one day and her mom told her she could homeschool and not have to go back. Well she went back and said to her mom "" If I don't go back to school that will just let the bullies win and I don't want that"". I said the same thing to my mom. I had maybe four days left and all four days I sucked it up and went to school just to show the bullies that they weren't going to win. And that no matter how awful they could be I was still going to come to school whether I wanted to or not. To this day I thank each and everyone of those girls for the way the treated me. If I didn't go through that then I would never be where I am in life right now. THIS MOVIE IS SOOOOO AMAZING.",1453939200,5,1518,3.8222222222222224

7481624,5,B016ZGYFE4,"Powerful movie. It's the story of a bully and her victim. You get both sides. Although it is just a fictional movie filmed in documentary style it definitely feels real to life. Anyone who has been bullied or witnessed it can relate to the movie. There are a few parts that waver a bit but in all it's a perfect movie for a parent or teacher to watch and maybe even for middle or high schoolers to watch as well (maybe during a class). This isn't an after school special. It's not some cheesy/glossed over lightly done take on the issue. That is not to say that it has anything R-rated, gruesome or grotesque or large violent scene in it. Not at all. At least not visually. It's all emotionally, the little by little, the very real harassment and gradual decline of a bullying situation. It's probably the best movie to be made on bullying (as of yet) and so I highly recommend it for those who want to understand a bit better what teens go through (and what drives some of them to suicide). You will feel the emotion of it by the end of the movie.",1453766400,14,1048,4.297979797979798

7481629,3,B016ZGYFE4,"The sentiment is fine, but the dialogue and acting were so fake, I could only observe the story, but not feel it.  Will there be a film on this topic that is so well done that the emotions felt by the viewer spur the public into taking more decisive and effective action?  I don't know what form that would take, but for an art work to effect real social change, it needs to be profound.  Instead, it felt like the characters were saying words to show us that bullying is bad.",1453593600,2,476,4.208791208791209

There is so much bullying going on right now in schools and even out of schools. MORE TEENAGERS NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE.

This may qualify for an after school special with sugary syrup sprinkled on top.  Acting was lousy too.",1453593600,2,349,4.8

8737663,5,B016ZGYFE4,"I'm according this five stars on the grounds that it's well-scripted, immensely well-acted, and highlights a truly pernicious and ubiquitous problem of our society that receives (albeit some) still *very insufficient* attention.  Else I'd have given it four, simply because I think, in an effort either to maximize poignancy or to provide a redemptive ending, it has the perpetrator behaving and reacting in a way that it is not merely implausible, but nearly inconceivable, and wholly incompatible with everything we know about the empathy-bereft nature of sociopaths.  Perhaps the girl isn't meant to be one, but the entirety of her behavior for a whole year bespoke nothing but meanness and Schadenfreude, and the problem the film is trying to address *is* one almost universally attributable to the behavior of sociopaths (if not psychopaths), and the atavistic deference that non-sociopathic members of our society, from middle school onward, afford to the truly psychopathic and predatory, entitlement-flaunting, power-seeking predators among us.
