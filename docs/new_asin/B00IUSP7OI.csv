6297391,5,B00IUSP7OI,"This is the long awaited ""Theatrical Version"" of the film. It does not contain the ""Directors Cuts"" - You should already have them!
It is not 2 separate movies, its one long 3 hour movie.......as originally seen in theatres.

""The Machete trailer that everyone is stating isn't included""....... FACT! Machete plays before Planet Terror as it was supposed to.
It never screened alongside the other ""fake"" trailers during the intermission.

This version has only been available as an import from Japan and an enormous mark up, so pre order now!",1284854400,28,542,5.011111111111111

""We've been doing some digging, and have learned from official studio sources that the Machete trailer IS on the forthcoming Grindhouse: 2-Disc Collector's Edition Blu-ray set. As was the case with the previous DVD and Blu-ray, the trailer is actually PART of Planet Terror so it's there but just not listed in the special features. We've also confirmed that the films are the theatrical versions only.""",1281744000,46,430,5.323529411764706

6297395,4,B00IUSP7OI,"I saw this movie in theaters and was kind of pissed when Miramax split it into two movies because it wasn't doing so well as one.  Planet Terror was pretty good, Death Proof was OK, but the TRAILERS WERE AWESOME!!!  I refused to buy the individual films because I knew they would eventually release it as a whole.  They even showed the theatrical release on cable to hold me over.  Unfortunately I heard they are omitting the ""Machete"" trailer from the beginning because the real movie is coming out soon or some hooey. I think that's crap.  They should edit in the new trailer, or even better, LEAVE IT ALONE.  I'll buy this version anyway, but I'll be mad if they fix it a year down the line.",1281398400,2,694,4.3828125
6297396,4,B00IUSP7OI,"(*very minor plot details ahead*) I had the pleasure of actually seeing this movie in an actual drive-in? Grindhouse was the perfect movie for these circumstances, reminiscent of the days of old, when people watched B-grade movies at the drive-in. The fake trailers (including one that is fake no longer - Machete, which is due out in theaters in September) are excellent and all look believable. There were even old-style drive-in commercials in between the two films (although I'm not 100% they were in the regular theatrical movie-house release). That's what made this so fun!!
The first film is Planet Terror. This is your standard B-grade horror film, with insane amounts of blood, violence, and comedy as well. Rose McGowan plays the main character, a dancer, who long story short, after a mutated virus smoke thing turns everyone to zombies, Rose gets a machine-gun leg when hers needs to be amputated due to a zombie infection. Also along for the ride are Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, Naveen Andrews (Lost), and long-time underrated actor Michael Biehn (Terminator). If you enjoy Dawn of the Dead-type movies you'll enjoy this one.
The second film is Death Proof. I'm not sure how to characterize this film. This movie comes from the always sick mind of Quentin Tarantino. Death Proof stars Kurt Russel as Stuntman Mike who enjoys driving his stunt car that essentially ""death proof"". He enjoys getting in car crashes and loves to kill beautiful women along with it. This movie also stars Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell, and Rose McGowan (again). Stuntman Mike picks on these girls, but soon may regret it as the girls try to pull a 180 on him. You have to see it to really enjoy the suspense.
So, that sums up the 2 movies and I give the following ratings: All the fake trailers and drive-in stuff: 5 stars, Planet Terror: 4 stars (I liked it but it was a bit corny here and there), and Death Proof: 3.5 stars (very action-packed but just felt real long). Total grade: 4 stars (not an avg.)",1280966400,6,1991,4.757225433526012
6297397,3,B00IUSP7OI,"I saw the Grindhouse experience in the theater.  Loved the trailers, not as much of a fan of Death Proof as Planet Terror.

I've already got the extended Blu-rays of both films on Blu-ray.  But was happy to place my pre-order this given the inclusion of the trailers not offered on either of the individual releases.  However, I found out that both of the films in this set are the theatrical versions.  Each films a good 10 minutes or more shorter than the extended editions.  and since I'm much more fond of the uncensored extended editions, this put me in a pickle.  Do I own both simply to have the trailers?  As much of a fan as I am, I just couldn't do it, so I canceled my order.  a pretty big bummer.",1280880000,6,708,4.2631578947368425

Wouldn't have bought if I had known it wasn't the full version. Looking more closely at the description, it does say in it's theatrical version, so I suppose that is where I was suppose to assume things were missing but I didn't even think to look that closely.

6297426,4,B00IUSP7OI,"A good friend of mine, and myself, went to see Grindhouse on opening night at a fantastic old theater just fifteen miles down the road from our hometown. It's a great little theater that still has the classic seating, no stadium seating here. Of course we've got theaters with stadium seating, there's actually about five to choose from within a twenty-five-mile radius, but this theater just has this wonderful classic feel. You walk in through the double doors and the red carpet flows straight down the middle of the room towards the silver screen with a row of soft lights that line both sides of the carpet. There is seating on both sides of the carpet with rows that are about twelve seats wide. What's great about this theater is that along with all the new and current films that they show, they also show old films on Wednesday nights. And they often show an array of films like Pulp Fiction, Shaun of the Dead, Young Frankenstein, Beetlejuice, The Shining, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Who Framed Roger Rabbit. They never cease to surprise. And what's even greater about this theater is that it only costs two dollars to see these old films. And they also don't charge an arm and three legs for some candy and popcorn and a drink. Anyway...my good friend and I saw Grindhouse in this theater and the experience was perfect in every way. There was actually even a fifteen minute intermission between the two films, which was just delightful. Now, I saw that Grindhouse was finally released on blu-ray...so why not? This is a very nice addition to my movie collection...especially for ten bucks...but I must say that I do enjoy the extended and uncut version of Death Proof much more than this version.",1475884800,,1717,4.707641196013289

6297446,3,B00IUSP7OI,"I was one of the folks lucky enough to catch ""Grindhouse"" in the theaters back in 2007, and never really wanted to re-visit the individual films separately, so I'm glad they finally released the original ""Grindhouse"" double feature as seen on the big screen. I see other reviews stating that this disc is missing parts of each film, and I can only guess that those reviews have only seen the fleshed out, individual films. This Blu-Ray is exactly what I saw in theater, it's not ""missing"" anything (except where intentional).

I loved the experience of see this film, it's a wonderful package of coming attractions, restaurant ads, and ratings info, the presentation transports me right back to the glorious days of my local drive-in double features. The idea, and the packaging of these films is greater than either of the films in the double feature.

With that said I thoroughly enjoyed ""Planet Terror"". It's loud, gory, sexy, funny and truly a great homage to those bloody splatterfest films of the 1970's and 1980's. After chemical leak near an old army base, a small town is Texas is overrun by flesh eating mutants. A small band of survivors use any and all weapons at hand to survive. Great cast, lots of fun, and plenty of fantastic visuals that create on hell of a ride.

Next up we get a few phony coming attractions, and each is so over-the-top and fun, you can't help but enjoy this 10-15 minute segment.

""Death Proof"" is I guess the main attraction, with Kurt Russell playing Stuntman Mike. A serial killer that enjoys using his fortified muscle car as his weapon of choice. This is where ""Grindhouse"" kind of comes off the rails, because after the non-stop thrills of the first 90 minutes, we are thrown into a talky, slow paced film, that seems designed more to showcase Tarantino's foot fetish more than any thrills or chills. We get 40 minutes of babbling, followed by 5 minutes of excitement, followed by another 40 minutes of babbling, all leading to a tepid climax.

I often wonder if the lackluster performance of this film is due to the fact that ""Death Proof"" is so damn boring? I almost think it would make a better viewing experience to watch Tarantino's film first, followed by the non-stop ""Planet Terror"". I still think this film as a whole is greater than it's parts, and it's one I'll re-visit down the road, but really wish ""Death Proof"" were a better movie.",1455667200,10,2391,4.6968973747016705

6297452,5,B00IUSP7OI,"I review the fist part of grind house before but wanted to review this re release of both films on one blue ray and all the fake movie commercials before and after the movie, well except for machete they ended up making that into a movie. And I heard Eli Roth was going to make thanksgiving day eventually. But on to the review. If you don't know what it is about or have not heard anything about it. It's a throw back to the early eighties or late seventies exploitation films. Back then you could go to a theater and sometimes see a grind house film and sometimes their would be a couple of really cheesy and cheap horror movies back to back. This is a throw back to those days with two horror movies made with two different directors. The first Planet Terror directed by Robert Rodriguez (Desperodo, Sin City) and the second film Death Proof Qunantin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Django Unchained, Hateful Eight) . Before the first movie even starts out there's the fake commercials of upcoming movies which awesome to and very humorous. The first film is Planet Terror which is my favorite. It's also the most over the top. A quick run down with minor spoilers. A small town gets polluted by a green gas that's causes people to turn into zombies cause by a army experiment gone wrong led by a army colonel (Bruce Willis). Now it's up to a Go Go dancer (Rose McGowen) and her boyfriend (Freddy Rodriguez) to say the day. As the town gets over run by zombies. Very over too gore and not to be taken very serious with one legged machine gun go go dancers. A lot of surprise cameos from Josh Brolin, Quentin Tarantino, Micheal Bien Ect. If you like over the top gore, and practical gore effects you well love this film. Off to the second film after some more humorous coming attractions previews. Their Death Proof by Quentin Tarantino. Staring stunt car Mike. A sadistic serial killer who kills women by means of his stunt car. Still a very entertaining movie just slow in certain parts, doesn't have the same fast place as planet terror but still a solid film in its own rights. Like any Quentin Tarantino film there's a lot of dialogue which is good or bad but here just seems to really drag in certain areas but somehow in the end adds to the story. But his film is more down to earth and more realistic than planet terror. Still both films are a blast! Such a cool and fun experience. A must have for any horror fan.

Planet Terror - love the zombies and reason for the zombies. Interactions among the characters was strong as well. Take note of small things that refer to other things in the movie. I've watched it several times so now watching for the small references.

""Trailers"" - As you know Machete was made into a full-length movie with Danny Trejo. Others are awesome: Don't; Thanksgiving; and the obligatory WWII/Nazi film.

If you don't know what ""grindhouse"" movies are or are expecting anything remotely above MST3K-level content, don't bother.

I wasn't disappointed in the movies themselves, as they were what I expected. However, this DVD is just a DVD-R made from a low-quality VHS transfer. Obviously the original film-print wasn't going to be that great, but you'll actually see modest tracking issues from the VHS transfer that was made.

6297497,5,B00IUSP7OI,"Grindhouse was a film that was misunderstood from the moment it debuted in theaters and reading many of the reviews here I see that it's still suffering from the same fate.  The Blu-ray version of Grindhouse in its original chopped up, missing reels, fake trailer glory is what I was eagerly anticipating since first seeing it in the cineplex.

The transfer is gorgeous as is the sound.  I can't fault the quality in any way.  Yes there are blemishes, scratches, burn outs, and other assorted film artifacts, but this is EXACTLY as the filmmakers wanted it.  They were going for the 70's double feature exploitation vibe transporting you to a time when these battered canisters of film played nonstop for months on end.

For those who think the extended versions should have been included in this release please recognize two things.  First, the extended releases were only created to make up for the lack of box office numbers due to the confusion average movie goers experienced.  Second, the runtime of the extended editions combined would be insane (excluding the trailers).  Grindhouse in its theatrical version ran for 191 minutes (3.18 hours) which pushed the limits of even die-hard movie fans.  The two extended versions (Planet Terror 105 + Death Proof 113) would run for a whopping 218 minutes (3.63 hours) and doesn't even include the trailers.

If audiences couldn't stomach the original version then what makes you think they could handle even more material with less charm?  Seriously, those fake trailers hit many people's joy buttons hard enough to green light 2 films based on the 1st one alone.

(tl;dr) If you loved the theatrical version of Grindhouse then snag this Blu-ray ASAP.  If you didn't understand the film's goals when it first came out then please stop complaining about this incredible release and go watch something else.",1413244800,4,1855,4.98051948051948
6297498,5,B00IUSP7OI,"It seems you can never make people happy. When these movies were first released, consumers were upset that the movies were too long, had too much talking, etc. They were extended releases.

The release is great. The extras are great. The movies are great. Stop complaining; if you want extended cuts, look for another version. If you want the original movies as they were shown in the theater, in their original cuts, buy this!",1412380800,,554,4.821052631578947

While Part 1 (""Planet Terror"") is a good horror show it is Part 2 (""Death Proof"") that gets the blood really pumping as girls in cars get chased down by a crazed vehicular-homicidal maniac (played to the hilt by a brilliant, and smirking, Kurt Russell).

Don't waste a lot of time or money on the ""extended"" cuts of these two films separately.  ""Grindhouse"", as the ""twofer"" here (in this original theatrical-release format, and it looks on disc just like it did in theaters) is more than enough bang for your buck (plus, Rose McGowan appears in both segments!!).

6297520,5,B00IUSP7OI,"First of all, I think some people need to realize that both of these films are going for the midnight matinee/drive-in movie vibe from the 70's/80's. So, the films are going to appear as if they were shot on a low budget and they're going to seem cheesy at some points. If you're looking for some The Hobbit Super HD then you don't get what these films are representing or the vibe they are trying to capture. Sucks to be you if you just can't wrap your mind around that. Both films are very good, lean towards Deathproof as I do enjoy tarantino's typical film banter but he also brought to big screen a food old fashion car chase a la Bullit, Dirty mary Crazy Larry and Vanishing Point. Classic stunt work with classic cars revitalized. Listen, just sit back and enjoy the ride and enjoy the trailers, these films weren't aiming for the Best Movie Oscar but they are definitely fun and entertaining.",1386892800,,900,4.4939024390243905

I know they already made the extended versions and I have them both on dvd but I just thought that they would include the extra scenes since it is the collectors edition. The special features are also a great edition, there are extended cuts of the fake trailers (except thanksgiving) and also making of the trailers as well. The werewolf women of the ss got expanded nicely with a much longer trailer as well as commentary from Rob Zombie and Death Proof got a nice amount of special features as well. Bottom line if you enjoyed the entire grindhouse experience or are just a Rodriguez/Tarantino fan then this is a great buy. But if you want the most out of the individual movies then you would have to buy them separately which kind of blows in my opinion.",1383955200,,908,4.5426829268292686
6297523,5,B00IUSP7OI,"I totall dig this movie, it gives you the feel of an old classic horror double feature with a modern twist.  I prefer Death Proof over Planet Horror, but for a double feature horror night around Halloween; this is the way to go.",1383436800,,228,4.3023255813953485
6297524,3,B00IUSP7OI,"I will start by saying that I am a big fan of the classic grindhouse features. Those 1970's-80's films that were so bad that they were good. Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino attempt to recreate the grindhouse experience for the multiplex crowd in their double feature Grindhouse.

First up is Rodriguez's Planet Terror an evocation of the monster/zombie film that brings to mind the zombie films of Roger Corman. Following a coup at a Texas military base the population of a small town becomes body eating ""sickos"". The horde of zombie like creatures comes up against El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) and Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan)a go-go dancer whose leg is replaced with a large caliber gun. The story is nothing entirely new but it features lots of blood and gore. This is not intellectual entertainment but is pure popcorn munching excitement. The film opens with what was then a trailer for a fake film called Machete.

Following Planet Terror we get three more trailers: Rob Zombie's Werewolf Women of the SS, Edgar Wright's Dont and Eli Roth's Thanksgiving. All three trailers recall the various styles of 1970's exploitation cinema.

The second film is Tarantino's homage to the slasher flick: Death Proof. The twist here is that the killer uses a car to kill his victims. Death Proof is a slower film that boasts some of the better dialogue of the experience. Tarantino shows his great knowledge of both cinema and car culture. Tarantino says in one of the featureetes that he wanted to make one of the great car chase films and it is very possible that he has achieved his goal with this film.

I saw Grindhouse on the two disc blu ray collector's edition. While i enjoyed the films and the numerous special features, I will admit that I was a little underwhelmed by the discs themselves. The dics took what seemed like forever to load and the quirky menu configuration made finding what you were looking for somewhat of a chore. It took forever to get to Rodriguez's commentary track on Planet Terror and I had to switch players to get to the Roth commentary on Thanksgiving.

The non user friendly discs are the reason that one star was removed from this review. The films are extremely well done and quite fun to watch. There is a ton of bonus material that covers just about all aspects of the project. There are even audience reaction tracks and a featurette on Texas BBQ. With all this material this should be a no brainer to highly recommend but sadly because of the problems with the disc authoring it sometimes becomes a chore.

The blu ray discs contain both features and trailers on disc one. The menu for the films and the commentaries are somewhat hard to navigate if you choose not to watch both features in one sitting. The second disc which loaded very slowly contains the bulk of the bonus features on the films and the trailers. Thre is an hour long interview with the directors conducted by the New York Times that is well worth checking out. Unfortunately I could never find the BD live feature.

Check it out for the films and features  but good luck getting througn the the discs.",1382313600,2,3115,4.702752293577982

6297553,5,B00IUSP7OI,"Wow, i cant believe what ive just seen.. im literally writing this review right after watching this. the credits are rolling as im typing! i need to tell my fellow amazonians about this great blu-ray. ok so its 2 movies in one basically. Planet Terror and Death Proof. planet Terror is about a virus that spreads and turns a bunch of people into ""zombies"".. pretty much a standard zombie flick story line as in its just about survival.. but its better because its by Robert Rodriguez which means it has some crazy action in it. not to mention that the main character in the movie, loses her leg, but its later replaced by a freakin rifle and she goes around kicking a$$ like that lolol! but as good as that movie was, Death Proof was slightly better. This one is about a stunt driver, who for some reason, enjoys killing innocent women with his car, but later he tries to kill this group of girls that prove to be a bit more that he can handle.. in other words, he messed with the wrong group of chicks and pays quite the price.. the best part of Death Proof was the ending. thats was what left me speechless and led to me reviewing this immediately.. another thing that i enjoyed was the old school sort of feel to these movies. and what i mean by that is that they look like those old black and white films that have been made into color films and they have those movie projector lines showing up on the screen every now and then.. it makes it seem as though your watching it a drive in movie theater. in my opinion $18.00 for two movies is wayy worth it. and besides all this, you also get a whole separate disc full of bonus content and extras.

disclaimer: these movies are not for the faint of heart.. if your familiar with Dimension Extreme, Quentin Tarantino, Rob Zombie, or Robert Rodriguez, then you know what im talking about. but if not then i recommend you google them before buying this blu-ray..",1336694400,,1910,4.395480225988701
6297554,4,B00IUSP7OI,"Come on the whole movie is awesome the gore and bloody scenes, everything in there is good. It's like  the early 70's cult films but better.

Both films are included on disc one and some nice extras are on disc two.  But the extended uncut versions of each film are so much better than what is offered here.  Buy these films individually in their extended uncut versions.  The same extras offered in this double disc package are also offered on the single film versions.,1325030400,5,639,4.660714285714286
6297556,5,B00IUSP7OI,"The last movie I saw in the theater was Grindhouse. Not even kidding. I saw it on Good Friday, Easter weekend... opening night. I have not wanted to ""go to the movies"" since, because this film was everything I always wanted movies to be, since I started watching them when I was little. I saw Grindhouse when I was 31. It just knocked me over, with how entertaining it was... it never dragged or anything. The audience reaction on opening night was great. Everyone applauded as soon as Planet Terror ended. We were all like ""wft?"" during ""Werewolf Women"".... we were on the edge of our seats in fear and bliss during ""Don't"". We laughed and cringed (especially during the trampoline scene) during the ""Thanksgiving"" trailer. And then Death Proof started... we didn't know what to expect, until ""but to get the benefits, you REALLY need to be sitting in my seat."" Then it was full-on, insane entertainment. EXACTLY HOW MOVIES SHOULD BE.

So, I've not gone to the movies since. I just rent them through the mail or buy them these days.

Grindhouse, this version especially, is the reason I went out and bought a Bluray player! Seriously. This is the only Bluray I own.

Everyone who is a fan of this film knows that when the DVDs came out separately (WITHOUT THE FAKE TRAILERS or ANY of the good stuff)... and.... EXTENDED? (I personally HATE versions that were not theatrical ones), that was the WORST move for us diehard Grindhouse/PT/DP fans. A huge mistake on the part of Tarantino, Rodriguez, and particularly the distributors and production companies who put together the DVDs that way... thinking we'd dig them and buy them. Um, no.

I purposely avoided buying those extended/non-theatrical versions. I was hoping, with all that was in me, that Grindhouse would in fact, see a proper release (full theatrical with fake trailers, fake commercials, the ""get more out of life, go OUT to a movie.."" etc. etc. etc.... sometime later on. And it FINALLY did. Here it is!

What are you waiting for? Buy it, and revel in its complete, fresh, and nostalgic brilliance.

And I didn't even mention the special features.... they're there, and they are plentiful.

WORTH IT and then some. Again, this is the ONLY Bluray I own. I'm a projector/home theater guy and not so much an HD TV guy... I'm not interested in ""bursting colors"" and ""sharp, HD detail""... I want the movie experience in my house: surround sound, subwoofer rumbling, and 80 to 100"" of widescreen bliss. So essentially, I'm getting the Grindhouse experience fully, with this edition.

I realize I'm rambling now, but my point is--- since theaters aren't ""HD"" yet, I don't think this movie should be watched on a small (42"") HD TV. It should be experienced as intended in the theater.

One final note: I am a huge film buff, but these kinds of movies are probably my least favorite (I'm a drama/real story kind of guy... Woody Allen, indie films, heavy on the dialogue and please, no explosions and car chases).... but despite that fact, I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. Grindhouse is a movie experience to be cherished and treasured. Again, this movie is what I always wanted the ""going out to the movies"" experience to be, and it is exactly that and more.

Do yourself a favor.... get a projector, get a decent surround sound system, and dedicate a room in your home to the movie experience. Watching this movie in that environment will make you love movies again.",1324684800,5,3417,4.727731092436975
6297557,4,B00IUSP7OI,"GRINDHOUSE is a film that belongs on a list of a genre that I call the Kick-Ass Film. These kind of films are usually not intended to be great masterpieces. They are intended to be a lot of fun and can be easily dismissed as guilty pleasures. They also have a level of violence, blood, gore, and explosions carried to an unbelievable extreme. John Woo really got this genre off to a big start with his Hong Kong shoot-em-up films. Oliver Stone put his own style with the screenplay for SCARFACE, and his directing of NATURAL BORN KILLERS. Rob Zombie has done it with THE DEVIL'S REJECTS and his interpretation of HALLOWEEN. And in GRINDHOUSE, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino get into the act.

To be fair, Rodriguez has always been making Kick Ass Films. He demonstrated that with DESPERADO and FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. Tarantino did the same thing with his KILL BILL films and with PULP FICTION. But with GRINDHOUSE they take the Kick Ass Film genre, throw in some very big laughs, and create one hell of a movie ride. When you finish watching a Kick-Ass genre you may really despise the film, but you will certainly be completely worn out by the experience.

GRINDHOUSE gets off to a start with the first of the 4 fake trailers: MACHETE by Rodriguez. This trailer is so incredibly bloody and violent, not to mention foul mouthed, that one would think, ""no way would it ever get played as a real trailer."" It's ironic that it later became a full length movie, and I saw the real trailer for the actual film before it came out. As a fake trailer Rodriguez can get away with it. Plus there are parts of it that made me laugh really loud. I know Danny Trejo had done roles as a lead actor, but they were mostly direct to video releases. MACHETE is the kind of film that can turn an actor's career completely around. (Rodriguez calls Trejo a Mexican Charles Bronson. After seeing this trailer and the movie I can see what he was talking about.)

Next comes Rodriguez's PLANET TERROR. This is the director's personal spin on the old Zombie movie. George Romero and Tom Savini did their own Kick Ass Film in 1979 with DAWN OF THE DEAD, but PLANET TERROR takes the blood and gore to an even higher extreme. There is not much of a plot to speak of. A group of Texas people must fight for their lives when a Zombie plague is unleashed due to a toxic gas leak at a military base. I liked the casting choices that Rodriguez uses, including Freddy Rodriguez and Rose McGowan. But I was really delighted to see three men I had not seen in the movies in a long time: Michael Biehn from THE TERMINATOR, F/X makeup legend Tom Savini, and Carlos Gallardo: the original EL MARIACHI. Like he did in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, Savini creates a really funny performance, giving you the sense that he was just plain having fun. That was probably true among most of the other cast members. At the same time this film shows some amazingly creative makeup work. I know it was done with a combination of CGI and old-school puppet/appliances on the actors, but it's done so seemlessly that I couldn't help but be amazed. And with Rose McGowan Rodriguez uses a very clever way for her to fight against the zombies with a combination leg and assault rifle. (I'm not giving it away; the trailers for GRINDHOUSE and the posters already did that.)

After PLANET TERROR we get an intermission with fake trailers by three big name directors in Horror today: Rob Zombie, Edgar Wright (SHAUN OF THE DEAD), and Tarantino's friend Eli Roth (HOSTEL). Zombie starts off with WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE SS. That name alone was enough to get a big laugh out of me. He doesn't fill the trailer with the level of blood and gore you expect in one of his films, but this is one of the funniest trailers I have ever seen at the movies. All I can say about this is that I hope Zombie decides to make it into a full length movie, and brings in all the actors featured in the trailer. (The last actor got a surprise laugh out of me and no way am I revealing who he is here.) Wright comes next with DON'T. The only thing I can say about this trailer is that it is meant to look like a Haunted House film. It's really silly and fun at the same time. The final trailer in this intermission is THANKSGIVING by Roth. Roth is a director who has talent, but I wish would be making better movies than HOSTEL; they are definitely Torture Porn, no matter what he says to counteract the argument. With THANKSGIVING, he takes on the Mad Slasher/Holiday splatter film. Some of the scenes in the movie kind of create really bad laughs, but I think it would be interesting what he could do if it were made into a feature length movie. (He has said he really wishes to do that one day.)

Quentin Tarantino's film is the final act in the experience: DEATH PROOF. The director takes on the mad slasher genre and adds a unique twist to it. The killer uses a ""Death Proof"" car as a murder weapon, and when we first meet him you don't expect him to be a killer at all. He is played by Kurt Russell, an actor I have really liked ever since I was a kid. (I grew up on the teen/Disney films he did in the 70's, and I'm a huge fan of his Snake Plissken character). It is a delight to see him in this movie and when he reveals his character's homicidal zeal he really goes over the top in the performance. Tarantino splits the movie into two acts. In the first one a group of pot smoking girls go out for a night on the town, visiting two Austin bars where they hook up with a couple of friends. They engage in very long conversations, and Tarantino let's the dialogue run along. That's typical of Tarantino movies, and I really don't mind. The dialogue he creates has always been interesting to hear. Russell's character, Stuntman Mike, observes and listens to them. He offers a ride to a stereotyped character sitting next to him: the Dumb Blond Cheerleader. This leads up Stuntman Mike using his car to murder the Dumb Blond and the four girls driving down an empty road. It's a combination of a bloody mutilation and incredible car crash.

After killing these five girls and apparently getting away with it thanks to a talk by Michael Parks to his son, we move to the second half of the film. Stuntman Mike sets his sights on four ladies. They are actors, judging from the dialogue between them. Two of them are apparently stunt women; one of them is Zoe Bell, who is a real life stunt lady. (She was Uma Thurman's double in the KILL BILL movies). They have a long talk over breakfast about what they are working on, and Bell says she wants to test drive a Dodge Challenger like the one in the action film VANISHING POINT. They go to a remote location where they talk the owner of a Challenger into letting them test-drive it by themselves. When they do, Zoe does a very dangerous trick with the car, which leads to them being attacked by Stuntman Mike. Once he comes along, DEATH PROOF goes into absolute overdrive in one of the most incredible car chases I've seen in any film. Tarantino doesn't use any CGI in this chase; it is real cars crashing into each other, driven by real stunt drivers. One of them I consider the best stunt driver in the movies: Buddy Joe Hooker. When the chase started I thought that Stuntman Mike would get away again, but he clearly picks the wrong victims when he goes after these ladies.

That's the experience of GRINDHOUSE: a double feature over three hours in length. You'll probably love it or probably hate it. You know who you are.

(note) The Blu-Ray of GRINDHOUSE includes another fake trailer that became a feature length movie in 2011: HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN. Rodriguez sponsored a contest inviting filmmakers to come up with their own GRINDHOUSE style trailers. This one was the winner. It is another incredibly funny one with the level of violence, blood, and gore to qualify as a Kick-Ass Film. It makes no apologies for what it is or what it is about. I discovered it on You Tube. When I get the chance to see it I will write a review for it.",1320796800,,8007,4.412719891745602
6297558,5,B00IUSP7OI,"Damn you Weinstein bros! I bought these 2 movies seperately then eventually bought this version, which is what I remember from the movie theater. If you don't like Grindhouse, I think it's because you just don't get it. I like the older flicks like Maniac, Zombie, House by the Cemetary, etc, you get the jist. The fake trailers, finally, they had been included in the packaging. This was just all around fun.
At first, you might be put off at DeathProof but the more you watch it, it will grow on you. You'll pick up on the little nuances before it turns gonzo in the last reel. Before he gets to the last victims, it was actually fun to watch Stuntman Mike interact with his victims.
Planet Terror, what really needs to be said about this, really? It's an awesome zombie/apocolypse flick and Fergie is looking as delish as always, Damn you Josh Duhamel!!!! And let us not forget, Cherry cuz she's just Cherry.

6297561,5,B00IUSP7OI,"The first movie story is ""Planet Terror"" which tells the story of a deadly military experiment gone wrong when a gas is unleashed turning soldiers into mutant zombie-like creatures that begin to attack a town to spread their virus through their bites. Sexy former stripper Cherry Darling (Rose Mcgowen) who got her leg severed by creatures joins with a maverick (Freddy Rodriguez), a female smuggler (Naveen Andrews), a restraunt owner (Jeff Fahr) and a doctor (Mary Shelton) as they battle to survive and try to battle every one of those abominations and find out the secret to all this madness.

Next we have ""Death Proof"" which tells a tale of revenge for it's about an Austin stunt driver named Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) who has a taste for sexy women who stalks, kidnaps them and kills them with his vehicle and is also a secret hit-and-run driver. Four women Zoe (Zoe Bell), Aberanthy (Rosaio Dawson), Pam (Rose Mcgowen) and Butterfly (Venessa Ferlito) are seeking revenge on those that killed their friends.

An outstanding cinematic experiment from directors and producers Robert Rodridguez and Quentin Tarantino is one of 2007's most acclaimed movies. This 3 hour anthology tells 2 quality tales of horror, thrills and suspense interluded with 4 very cool fake trailers with one for ""Machete"" by Robert Rodriguez before ""Planet Terror"" starts then after that we see trailers to ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" directed by Rob Zombie, Edgar Wright's ""Don't"" and Eli Roth's ""Thanksgiven"" which all should be movies soon. Each film replicates the haydays of 70's and early 80's grindhouse cinema where things are un-PC and this movie is no holds bar. ""Planet Terror"" is easily the best and most exciting movie of the 2 stories for it's non-stop gore and action with great performances by everyone including Rose Mcgowen who is one of horror cinema's most reasonably great female chracters who weilds a machine gun for a peg leg that she uses to kick butt. ""Death Proof"" is the weakest of the 2 movies mainly for it's slow pace and some talky stuff but the second half of that movie makes up for it as it gives a ""Hitcher"" style highway chase that goes for the pulse. The films both have intermission interludes plus grainy looking film at times with a couple of missing reels to make it feel like it's a grindhouse movie and co-stars Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth, Nicolas Cage, Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Michael Biehn, Tom Savini, Danny Trejo, and Cheech Marin.

This 2 disc Blu-Ray offers awesome sound and picture quality with terrific extras like audio commentary for planet terror plus audience reaction, Makeup effects of Planet Terror, 10 minute cooking school of Robert Rodriguez, From texas to Tenessee: Production Design of Death Proof, Hot Rods of Death Proof, Extended cuts of the fake trailers with audio commentaries plus the making of the fake trailers, storyboard trailer comparision to ""Don't"" by Edgar Wright, Still and poster galleries, Comic con 2006 with the cast and directors of Grindhouse, New York Times interview, Hobo with a Shotgun fake trailer, Robert Rodriguez's 10 minute filmschool, Casting reel, the Babes and Guys of Planet Terror featurette, 3 PT featurettes and 4 DP featurettes plus the uncut version of Baby it's You.",1307923200,,3258,4.985294117647059

It's great that the producers finally got around to releasing Grindhouse the only way it should be seen, in its original theatrical version -- but a travesty that it was only made available in blu-ray. Those of you who don't own a blu-ray player and aren't too keen on spending $100-plus just so you can buy this DVD can get ahold of the theatrical DVD by visiting amazon.ca (Amazon Canada). The format is NTSC and can be played on USA DVD players. I got mine for just over $30 (even with expedited shipping).

NOTE: It appears the blu-ray has tons more extra features. But if you don't mind sacrificing watching those to be able to stay blu-ray free, this is the way to go.

I'm glad I waited for the special edition because not only did it have both films but also the fake movie trailers that played with the movie in theaters and more bonus features than I know what to do with (including a 10 minute very informative how to cook BBQ the Robert Rodriguez way).

6297569,4,B00IUSP7OI,"What I meant by nonsensical title was that *I* ran out and got the Blu-Ray the day ""Grindhouse"" hit stores. Ran home, watched all of the previews, the movies, and all of the extras. It was great! HOWEVER, you'd have love the hell out of this movie to watch it. I mean, for the 2 weeks (give or take) that ""Grindhouse"" was in theatres, I saw it once; then, once the movie got ""split into 2 parts"" I refused to go near it; however, I still a) bought the Director's Cuts of both of these films when they debuted on DVD; b) obtained a rip from satellite [including both of the movies AND the ""fake trailers"", but no extra material besides that], and c) our local, small town ""repertory theatre"" had 2 ""Quentin Tarantino"" months [one shortly after the Weinsteins cut the movie in half, leading to theatres to drop ""Death Proof"" and/or ""Planet Terror"" like a bad habit; and one more time after ""Inglorious Basterds"" finished it's run at theatres.]

Point is, people like *me*, the ""twisted die-hard 'Grindhouse' fans"", is exactly whom this Blu-Ray was released for. I know some people who have REFUSED to watch ""Kill Bill 1&2"" on DVD, because Tarantino has said that he will be releasing the uncut, sequentially re-ordered ""KB 1&2"". I don't have that patience, but if this sounds like something *YOU* would do (i.e. - you don't care HOW many times you've purchased the separate ""Grindhouse"" movies), then buy it!

And for those that have never seen Grindhouse (or if you've never bought this particular item), I *insist* that you run out and buy it now!

That said, I have big technical problems with this disc --- it could just be my Sony BluRay player but I have no such problems with any other BluRay discs or streaming video services.

First of all, all the extra BD Live-type features are virtually unwatchable. They buffer literally every 5 seconds. I even tried to hard connect the Network connection over my standard wireless config with no improvement.

Almost worse, many of the special features start playing with remnants of the menu selection cards blocking a quarter of the screen. This happens sometimes, and then it doesn't. Nice.

Obviously whatever process the producers of this disc are following is NOT standard to most BluRays. Maybe it looked like a cool idea but the bottom line is that you wind up with a disc full of screwed up content.

The dynamic duo of Tarantino (Kill Bill films) and Rodriquez (Sin City) have created a terrific masterpiece of horror, smart writing and sick humor.  Not for the faint of heart, Tarantino's ""Deathproof"" features Kurt Russell as a serial killer with a unique way of hunting his victims.  Rodriguez's contribution ""Planet Terror"" is a zombie film with a twist.  Rodriquez always seems to find the most beautiful actresses to play his characters.

6297575,3,B00IUSP7OI,"When it comes to originality in the last 15 years film, Quentin Tarentino and Robert Rodriguez are two of the major names that come to mind. Each of these directors does their best to make their movies stand out with a little awkwardness and an appeal to the traditional film fan boy. `Grind house' is probably their most unique effort for many reasons. This was a film that was actually two 90 minute films for the price of one admission. This was not a film festival event nor was it a limited time offer for the movie going public. What you have to love about these two directors is they make movies for the sake of making movies and more importantly, they make them based on the influences that got them where they are today.
Grindhouse is a tribute to 1970s-1980s low budgets `B' cinema. Normally shown in the theaters that no one would go to on a Saturday night, a back to back admission would show an under budget over acted slasher/action film in all of its cheesy glory.  So, Tarentino & Rodriguez pay that tribute with a film from each of them.
`Planet Terror' is your classic monster film. A disease has gripped a small town turning the populace into brain eating zombies and it's up to an outlaw and a one legged starlet to put an end to the madness. The cast is filled with a ton of well known names and of course a few surprises. Rodriguez captures the horrible acting and extreme fantasy gore in this picture as well as some extremely horrible jokes. You can definitely tell that these big named actors are having so much fun playing over the top horrible. Some of the lines are so terrible, but you laugh because that's the goal of the film. Also, you see Rodriguez's signature work in him always using the outlandish and completely insane, like a girl with a machine gun for a leg. The next film is `Death Proof', the story of a mysterious ex-stuntman played by the awesome Kurt Russell and how he has become the classic murdering drifter in an unstoppable muscle car. Tarentino gets probably his most charismatic cast since Jackie Brown and of course gives us his classic dialogue scenes. I liked this one the best because not only is it signature Tarentino, but he also throws in a bunch of references from his past films. If you are a fan of his you will no doubt catch the references.
My take on `Grind house' is somewhere in the middle. While I love both of these directors, these two films really were not my cup of tea. They were fun to watch and I loved the homage to the `B' movies especially the camera work with the scratch patters on the film and bad editing cuts. However, I never really was a big fan of the typical cheesy grind house film, so that is probably why they don't appeal to me as much as a film like Sin City or Pulp Fiction. I do give a ton of respect to the casts of both films. Everyone from Rosario Dawson to Josh Brolin just took time out of their `serious' acting schedule to just make a crazy over the top fun fest. I also wish that Mary Elizabeth Weinstead got some more screen time. Though I have only seen her in `Scott Pilgrim' I just love her acting and the fact that she played such a girly girl really impressed me. Then again Tarentino always knows how to take any actor out of their usual element and turn them into something awesome. I recommend that you see these movies, but whether or not they are worthy of your collection is up to you.",1290470400,,3400,4.371248025276461

Here's where you need to make a choice: do you want the two extended releases with TrueHD audio, or the theatrical releases with only Dolby Digital sound, and the fake trailers?  It's a tough choice but I chose the separate releases.  To me, both stories seem more fleshed out when given their director's cuts, and the trailers, while entertaining, don't warrant a purchase, especially a double dip.  There are several bonus features and behind the scenes for said trailers, but again not worth my money.

Reason's to buy this set, even if you already have the individual earlier releases:

2. New bonus feature ""Comic-Con 2006"" featuring a videotaped panel discussion, involving both directors and most of the female leads.  It was brief, but listening to Quentin & Robert made me wish so badly, that I could spend a day hanging out with them.
3. ""Hobo With A Shotgun"" trailer. Apparently this was created by a contest winner and it certainly deserved it.
4. There is also a ""New York Times Talk"" that is audio only and over 1 hour of discussion with the directors.  I haven't listened to it yet, but have heard it's fun and informative.

As far as the PQ goes, this looks as good as a film that is deliberately made to look battered and worn can look.  Much has been made about the lack of a lossless audio track but again, the audio track is full of pops and hisses added to make the film seem worn out so I think the standard 5.1 is fine.

I was so surprised by the freshness of the film, and the raw nature of everything presented. I have waited patiently for this movie to be released in it's proper theatrical form.

They're a bit softer than the Miramax editions, and I suspect that's due to the 2 movies being on one disc, and having an audience reaction track on PT.  We had one on the previous release, we don't need another one (I haven't played it on the new one, but fairly sure it's different since it's not the Extended version).  That would have given more room for a higher bitrate, and possibly a lossless soundtrack.  Colors and saturation are great otherwise.  Rate it for what it is and not what you want.

Now the sound...is it me or am I the only one who would prefer to view these films in MONO. Yes, I said mono. Remember fans of grindhouse cinema, this is suppose to transport us back to the '70s! Back then we didn't have BIG surround sound and HEAVY bass. These soundtracks should have cracks, distortion, the works. Even with 'plain' Dolby Digital, the sound is too BIG! It seems I was watching a movie in 2010 (or 1997 for DVDs Dolby Digital). I wanted the 'true' grindhouse experience!! The extended cuts of these two movies were way too BIG on the surround sound, so maybe trimming back a bit on the sound could be a good thing.
I can already see the posts and comments flying from the fans of this movie who are complaining about the compression scheme of the soundtracks...bring it on. This my opinion and I too have the right to give my two cents.

The video quality is terrific and there is no shortage of extras, clocking in around 3 hours of interviews, commentary and making-of specials. With the exception of the decision to not include two extra discs with the extended versions of both films, this is a nearly perfect package. For the Amazon price, thats a damn fine deal.

And the films themselves are super fun in their own right. Planet Terror is a breakneck melding of Day of the Dead with John Carpenter's mood and sensibilities. Death Proof is like Black Christmas or Sleepaway Camp mixed with Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!. It's the ultimate party movie - good when mixed with a lot of friends and a lot of beer. I just love the world that Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez create here, it feels like an expansion of what they were trying to do with ""From Dusk Till Dawn"".

The movies play just as they did in theaters, which to me is the best way to see them and it is packed with special features, a good amount of them exclusive to this set. If you liked the Grindhouse films, but didn't get to see them in theaters, or if your like me and wanted to recreate that experience, then I highly recommend this set. If you want the extended cuts, well then go buy those.",1286236800,321,1205,4.383928571428571
6297600,1,B00IUSP7OI,"This blu-ray release has very low quality dvd audio. No HD audio. Barely better than mp3 quality. The separate releases DO have excellent lossless audio. This is absurd. I will not buy this. High Definition is about picture AND sound, & while some may say it's supposed to be bad,it's really not. The separate releases sound phenomenal.",1286064000,19,336,4.912280701754386
6297601,5,B00IUSP7OI,"Seeing GRINDHOUSE in the theaters was one of the best cinematic experiences of my life.  It was a raw, funny, gritty, gory good time.  For those of you (and there were far too many) who missed out, my apologies; unless you're lucky enough to have a small cinema that actually shows stuff other than the current hits, you'll probably never have that experience.

This is as close as you will get.  It's different on a small screen, but you do what you can.  Included in this Blu-ray are both films in their theatrical versions (the ""missing reel"" in DEATH PROOF is still missing), all the trailers (including MACHETE; it's not listed on the packaging, but it's there), all the advertisements, all the static, all the fun--and all on one disc (which is why it isn't available on DVD).  The second disc contains your bonus features, and there are a ton: the ones from the separate DVDs, as well as a whole bunch of new features, including extended versions of most of the trailers (and respective makings-of; MACHETE is exempt, but let's face it, we now have an actual MACHETE film).  Even the packaging features fake movie posters and stills.

A warning, though: GRINDHOUSE isn't for everyone.  If you don't like campy horror artfully made, don't watch.  Neither PLANET TERROR nor DEATH PROOF is Rodriguez and Tarantino's best; they aren't supposed to be.  It's a package deal, which was why the two-disc DVD releases were a bit of a rip-off.  GRINDHOUSE is meant to be seen in one long stretch; devote an evening to it, have some friends over, eat some popcorn.  It's a cinematic experience, plain and simple.",1286064000,2,1608,4.741007194244604
6297602,5,B00IUSP7OI,"FINALLY!  After three and a half years the complete Grindhouse experience is coming out (and in Blu Ray no less).  I haven't seen this since the theaters because it's not TWO movies, it's one great EXPERIENCE!",1286064000,4,209,4.777777777777778
6297603,1,B00IUSP7OI,"While the quality of the films is debatable and opinions will vary based on individual preferences, the quality of the audio on this relase is not up for debate.  Blu ray touts high definition video AND audio, and for a manufacturer to not take advantage of the medias technical capabilities this far along in blu rays acceptance by the public is ridiculous.  I personally enjoyed the movies, but cancelled my order when I found out that this was being released with substandard compressed audio.  Send a message to Vivendi and boycott this release and demand a rerelease with uncompressed audio!",1285804800,11,596,4.94
6297604,1,B00IUSP7OI,"dvd sound on blu ray is not acceptable in 2010.  I understand sound is intentionally bad in this movie, but
give us the bad sound UNCOMPRESSED.  The single releases of these movies on blu ray had uncompressed sound
which added punch to the pops and hissing during the film, became more alive.  Older films that are done
in MONO are all uncompressed on blu ray, there is no reason why this release shouldn't be.  Shame on

6297607,5,B00IUSP7OI,"As you can tell, this is Grindhouse, the full release of the films as they were shown in theatres. The reason why you guys aren't getting the extended versions is because that's not how the film was shown theatrically, nor was it meant to be shown. The extended versions represent the films as standalone films. Whereas together, they represent the project that is Grindhouse. I own the extended versions on DVD and they're nice but the unrated material is not essential nor does it move the plot forward (mind you PT is still features the ""missing reel"" title), plus, as nice as it is to own them separate, nothing sets the guy flick mood like a friday night with your mates, some beers and snacks and three hours of pure gory fun. I saw Grindhouse in the theatre and it was the most fun time at the cinema, so I'm glad to get this together in HD.

Secondly, lots of people are bitching about Machete trailer being excluded. It was excluded since 20th Century Fox owns all the rights, as they have just released the full length feature film (which I personally thought was garbage. It can be a lonely road hating something big D:). That said since Dimension is distributing this (or here in Canada, Alliance), it makes sense.

And one more thing. You may or may not have noticed me referring to the extended versions. Although they got released as ""Unrated"" here in Canada, we call them extended versions because they're still with their Canadian ratings intact, therefore making it pointless for us Canucks to call it ""unrated"".",1285200000,3,1530,4.662962962962963
