8223497,1,B000WHXGLG,"So bad this movie may be worse than the worse movie - Plan 9 from Outerspace!!
Imagine the 1970s and you decide to piece together a ""movie"" using footage from another movie (all the prison women scenes). Pad the beginning and end of the movie with scenes shot with an actor walking around and looking at laser discs from World War II.
Hire some twins who are supposed to be clones and wrap a white towel around their necks (why?).

Yes, I did watch the whole movie because it was so bad I kept thinking I could make a better flick!! Someone must have made these DVDs from on old VHS copy, the quality is grainy and there's streaking along the bottom.
One star for the bellydancer and the tank! Robert Vaughn's name is even misspelled on the cover.",1442188800,,747,4.374100719424461
8223498,3,B000WHXGLG,"Robert Vaughn known mostly for playing Napoleon Solo in Man from Uncle was a
great actor too bad he didn't get better material after the hit show. He made some
great movies like Magnificent Seven and The Venetian Affair and played some
great roles on TV shows like Columbo but he made some really bad movies which
I'm sure he did to keep working. I have bought many of his movies on vhs and dvd
now that you can get them cheap as stores are getting away from those formats
and most are not good. This one I remember watching on late night TV and it's not
that bad except for the quality which would make it better. The script isn't so bad
it had a good plot just not written or directed or acted very good but Vaughn keeps
it together and it has veteran actor Keenan Wynn who's always a hoot. The plot
about Nazis coming back with a 4th Reich and making zombies was a good idea
but again this is one of those 70's movies that could've been good but isn't. If
your a fan of Vaughn or cheesy 70 TV movies this one isn't that bad except the quality.",1397952000,,1046,4.132352941176471
8223499,1,B000WHXGLG,"""The Lucifer Complex"" could not possibly be one of the 100 best; where on earth could that notion have come from?  My wife and I watched it all the way through because of its ""star power,"" and I can say without hesitation that it has no redeeming features whatsoever, not even the star power. It gives the impression of having been made by a high school movie class, and is surely one of the worst pictures ever made, if not THE worst.  The only reason for watching it is out of curiosity to see how truly dreadful a movie can be, kind of like a freak show.",1245024000,,557,4.196261682242991
