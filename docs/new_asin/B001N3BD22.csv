3709606,5,B001N3BD22,"My three-year-old absolutely loves these Word World videos and out of our entire collection, these are the movies he usually chooses to watch.

3709611,5,B001N3BD22,"My 9 month old daughter loves this show! She claps and dances to the music and is just fascinated with it. Especially when the characters ""Build A Word""!

We have collected all of the characters for her - she loves to pull them apart and then stick them back together. They are great learning tools ... we use them to point out letters, the sounds they make, the sounds they make when they come together and then the word itself!

A great association tool. I hope to have many more DVDs to come!",1237507200,,495,4.311827956989247

8323084,5,B001N3BD22,"I work in a class room with autistic children grades K-3 and everyone of them love the WordWorld movies.  After watching so many of them grow with these movies I decided to buy them for my two-year old brother (he does not have autism) to help him get an early start in learning.  He wasn't very interested in the movie the first time  he watched (probably his age) it but it is slowly growing on him.  I gave the movie 5 stars because WordWorld movies really do help kids how to spell, they are entertaining, and price is great.",1399766400,,529,4.313131313131313
