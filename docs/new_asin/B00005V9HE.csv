The animation in this is wonderful.  It's so great to see the flying sequences and all the shots with water - it's fantastic.  The music is just as good, capturing the mood of each scene wonderfully.  If you like CCS, there's no way you can miss this movie. Keep your eyes open for the release of the second movie as well!  Happy viewing!",1012262400,,517,4.171717171717172

When she gets to Hong Kong she finds that Syaoran and Meiling where in Hong Kong too.(Visiting their family)Sakura meets Syaoran's family, but there is a strange force that is after Sakura. I'm not going to tell you all about it because I don't want to give away the ending... But it's a happy one :)",1012003200,,385,4.287671232876712
1673006,4,B00005V9HE,"This movie is adorable! Not only does it contain excellent animation, superior to the already high quality animation of the tv seris under the same name; but the music and the quality of the feelings evoked while watching this film are enough to make the excellent (aka. extremely low) price of this DVD the best bargain you will ever find.
Sakura and Co. (Kero-chan, Tomoyo, Touya, and Yukito) take a trip to Hong Kong! A trip to Syaoran-kun and Meiling's home town?! How fun! Little do they know that the mysterious way that Sakura happened to aquire this trip means that they will all be caught up in one of Sakura's most dangerous trials to date! Told subtly, unfolding one revelation at a time, this movie is a story of love, loneliness, and the life of the sorcerer, Clow Reed.
This dvd is sure to be a hit among CCS fans here in the US as it was in Japan! + It is presented in widescreen ratio in the original (uncut) Japanese version w/ english subtitles! (ick, and there is a dub version)... Fans of CCS will love to follow Sakura on her winter break trip to Hong Kong between the 4th and 5th grades.
This movie is a nice break from the on-going card collecting of the series. And if you need a nice break, and some pretty Chinese style music to boot, then this is DEFINITELY the movie for you.",1011052800,21,1303,4.3884297520661155
1673007,5,B00005V9HE,"This is the Uncut version of the first Cardcaptor Sakura movie. This movie contains both the English and Japanese tracks (that's right, the dub is included).
The story takes place at the end of the first season. Sakura is busy capturing cards as the end of fourth grade approaches. As summer begins, she wins a trip to Hong Kong, China. So she, Tomoyo (with her video camera, or course), Toya and Yukito head off to Hong Kong. Once there she discovers some magical being is causing trouble, and being the one-and-only Cardcaptor she sets out to stop it (with some adventure along the way).
I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie if you like either the English version of Cardcaptors or the uncut CCS. It's a Shoujo, or a girl's show, and you'll find a lot of ""girly themes"" involved, but don't let that stop you.
I highly recommend this movie.",1010966400,11,837,4.586666666666667
1673008,5,B00005V9HE,"Sakura wins a Trip to Hong Kong! She, Tomoyo, Touya, and of course Yukito begin what was suppose to be a normal vacation. No Clow Card catching, just fun time with friends and Yukito-san! She even gets to meet Shaoran's beautiful mother and crazy sisters. Unfortunately, evil forces are drawing near, and a woman from Clow Reed's past brings relaxation to a halt, by invading Sakura's dreams, and ultimately present China. She seeks out the Clow Cards, but when she demands to know why Sakura has them, something more may be the problem. Will she save the day, as well as her Friends?
This is an absolute must for any Cardcaptor Sakura fan. It takes place after volume 9 (while Sakura is on Winter Break)
This Volume contains BOTH! the Japanese and American uncut Dub.
This also comes out a week after volume 8, so it's ok to watch without worrying whether or not you're missing anything. The movie has nothing to do with the overall plot, but it's great!",1010880000,23,955,4.623529411764705

As other anime fans will say again its best to watch the japanese version... the english is well... poorly dubbed to say the least also.. well...you don't get the same feel... the same tension and emotion in the voices it seems more real in japanese.

I liked cardcaptors when I was on tv but when i saw my first episode of Cardcaptor sakura, thanks to the advice of fellow anime fans, I fell in love with it! hehe I am not that taken by the dub... infact i crindge at it now... though I not against it and find myself watching the ones I taped now and again..

1673041,4,B00005V9HE,"I recommend this for any anime fan, Cardcaptor Sakura is a brillant anime, full of magic and action brought to you from CLAMP who have also created Chobits, Magic Knight RayEarth and Angelic Layer. But don't get Cardcaptor Sakura mixed up with Cardcaptors as Cardcaptors is for a younger audience which was cut and dubbed.

  It can be viewed in both Japanese and English, though I think it sounds so much better in Japanese as it is the way it was made, and I think it works better, but if you're not into subtitles then the English version is always an option.

  I very much enjoyed (though the second film is much better) it so give it a go, and remember......

1673042,5,B00005V9HE,"The Japanese actress/actors gives the character in this new movie a great voice!
What I like about this movie is that it has both languages, and lets you decide which you want to watch it in. I bought the Cardcaptor Sakura version simply because the Cardcaptor Version is outrageously terrible. I mean, the voice actress/actor sounds like adults trying to be kids. Although we all know that they are kids being kids. The voices don't see to match ANY of the characters!
But what made this movie special is that the Japanese actress/actors actually acted like the age of the character, but we all know that Sakura Tange is not a 4th graders. I really liked this.
Sakura wins a trip to Hong Kong, but when she leaves Japan and arrives in Hong Kong. Hong Kong gave her more than what she bargained for...",1089244800,3,801,4.569444444444445
1673043,5,B00005V9HE,"Facts:
  A movie of great success. I was pretty suprised with English Dub, they didn't do that bad on acting, the music may be a little off, and the dialouge as well but it was an entertaining movie. But on japanese dialouge, somehow you people think its dumb because they talk way different then us but, I thought it was KAWAII! Their music shows a relaxing way, forming type of way. Well, if there were no subtitle with Japanese then I probably wouldn't buy it but atleast there is. Anyways!

  Story:
  ""I've got the gold one, probably just the constilation prize."" says Sakura smiling with the golden ball in her hand. The lady at Twin Bells shop looks at the list of prize winners. ""Grand..."" Tomoyo looks confused as well with Sakura...it was probably it.
Sakura wins a trip to Hong Kong for about 3-4 days! But when Sakura gets there, she has these strange dreams. Of a woman, and a set of birds, mysteriously but weird. The presence lingers into her, finding this is no Clow Card, but something else. Her friends are trapped in a dimension, but Sakura must find a way to bring them back, Soo Young won't let her.
  Overall:
  This movie is about 85 minutes long, extras such as trailers, and dolby digital surround sound! So, if you like CCS, CC, or both then get this movie! Its not a waste of the money you have.",1084492800,4,1322,4.443983402489627

Of course they meet up with with the entire Li clan whose home is Hong Kong.  While there they learn a valuable lesson: magic lasts, its effects last.  The animation is quality and the soundtrack is better than the series.  Even Kero is less annoying.  I think it moves the plot along quite nicely and sets things up well for the third season of the series.  Very empowering for girls, too.",1076630400,2,498,4.417582417582418
1673045,5,B00005V9HE,"I reviewed this before, but somehow said reveiw never got put up, so I'll just do it again.  Here we have the first silver screen outing of our favorite ten year old magic girl and friends!
  First I need to partially retract a comment I made in my review of disc 11. We kick off this film with the capture of the Arrow card, which comes into useful play later on in the film, but is otherwise little more than a line item.(I still feel cheated - I REALLY wanna know what Libra does!)
  As school lets out for winter break, Sakura tries her luck at a ball pulling contest and, wouldn't you know it!, she wins the grand prize!(Actually, though she never knows it, she had a little ""help"".) The prize: a trip for four to Hong Kong! And since her father can't make it, she goes with Toya, Yukito, and, of course, Tomoyo-Chan.  But a voice is haunting her dreams, and trying to lure her into danger greater than any she's encoutered before! Even with the help of Syoaron and Meilin, home for the holidays, and Syoaron's powerful mother, Yelan, at her side, does she have any hope of victory?!
  Okay, a few points. The name of Li's mother comes from the insert that came with the DVD - at no point in either the dub OR the orignal Japanese is she ever referred to by name in the film, she is only called ""Li's Mother/Okaasan"".  Second, despite what others have said, the dub is just as good as the Japanese, and is probably the only CCS piece(at least until the other movie arrives in Nov. '03.) that is almost translated word for word. The only real differences aside of a few minor dialogue alterations for lip movement is the back story on the Sorceress/Madoushi. Other than that, nothing critical.  I especially love when Kero first looks at modern day Hong Kong and is stunned at the changes to his old home. It's a hoot in either language!
  Until I type again! Ja' nae!

CCS is such a kawaii show and the anime is awesome. I swear, CLAMP should be working for Disney because then Disney could have some good movies. Kero-chan is so naturally kawaii in the Japanese series. I love the series SO much but not in English. The English version is [bad] and the name changes stink.

1673057,5,B00005V9HE,"Sakura & Company are off on another adventure, this time to the beautiful city of Hong Kong, with Kero wise-cracking almost the entire time.  I purchased this DVD having very high expectations of what I wanted to see.  And Card Captor Sakura: The Movie rocketed above anything else.
I'm not including any summaries, as you can read them above, so I'll skip right to the comments and criticism.  This DVD contains both the Japanese and English Uncut Dub, both which I found entertaining.  But I will say this.  I think that the Nelvana version is not that bad.  COME ON PEOPLE!!  GIVE NELVANA A LITTLE CREDIT HERE!!!  I personally find the dub job very satisfying indeed.  It closely matches the original Japanese version, and the only big major difference is the ending (though I will say that I think Nelvana should have kept the original ending.  It makes much more sense).
And I will not give any points to the Japanese music or voices, because it severely sucked...in my opinion that is. The Japanese music is very girly, goody two shoes and extremely ANNOYING!  The English music is so much better because it has more of a realistic feel to it.
I also like how Nelvana made the character voices seem more mature.  Any other squeaky girl voice would have nagged the hell out of me.  Carly McKillip did a great job, as did the other english voice talents.
This DVD has a lot of extras, including trailers and clips, and widescreen options.
Overall, fantastic DVD in either Japanese or English.  People should really love this one.",1054425600,,1533,4.692883895131086
1673058,4,B00005V9HE,"Sakura Kinomoto has won a trip to Hong Kong, but was it really fate that brought her there?
The first movie of Cardcaptor Sakura has finally been released on DVD in america, and it couldn't have gotten any better! The DVD contains both English and Japanese audio tracks, but obviously the Japanese one is much better. The English 'Nelvana' version is pretty much a hack job, with them totally rewritting the main POINT of this film, changing the dialogue, and sending the music through the shredder. It'd be wise if you didn't watch it in this version, because this could easily be one of the worst dubs EVER.
Anyway, the DVD is also anamorphic, so it can fit the screens of those lucky dogs who have widescreen televisions. There's also some trailers and clips here and there. As for the actual movie, its not actually filled to the brim with action; its more of a mystery type thing, with some weird stuff happening to our dear Sakura as she stumbles into a supernatural mess of things. The movie isn't bland though, its got its' moments(Like Shaoran getting jealous over Yukito buying Sakura a gift.). The music is mostly different than what you're used to if you've seen the TV series. Most of it is Chinese-styled music, although there are some points where the traditional CCS march will kick in.
The animation is superb, even better than the TV shows', but don't expect much 3D CGI stuff here.
If you're a fan of the series, you should check this out. But if you aren't that familiar with Cardcaptor Sakura, trying to figure out the relationships of the characters may turn out to be a chore, making this movie less enjoyable.",1052611200,2,1633,4.653979238754325

1673061,4,B00005V9HE,"I had only seen a few ""Cardcaptors"" dubbed episodes on TV quite a while ago but I liked it, so when I heard the Cardcaptor Sakura movie was released on DVD I bought it just so I could get to know the story better.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't exactly explain the origin of Sakura becoming a cardcaptor so unless you've watched the anime show you'll probably be at a loss on what the Clow Cards are and much of the characters' relevencies.  This might be a spoiler but the ending just didn't satisfy me.  It just wasn't climactic.  Also, Sakura doesn't do all that much in this movie, just a lot of flying and every now and then using a Clow Card.  On a plus side, this movie is very nicely animated with beautiful scenery and interesting characters.  I was just hoping for a little more fighting action.  All in all, Cardcaptor Sakura The Movie will be fun for kids and true CCS fans to watch.

Apparently, ""adult entertainment"" was too hard, and extreme violence would have taken too much work, so this one struck strictly with the corny kiddy slop.

yet adventure always seems to seek Sakura out, even when
she's on vacation.
The animation in this film is a step up from the TV series,
but that's to be expected for a theatrical release.  Several
moments in the film leap off the screen, notably the city
scenes of Hong Kong itself.
The plot plays less as an extended episode (also known as
Card-of-the-Day) than as a tale of mystery and intrigue,
as not only does Sakura learn more about Li's family, but
also Clow Reed's history as well.  Sakura's dreams (which
can show her the future, just as in the TV series) are
haunted by a vengeful spirit intent on finding Clow Reed
by any means necessary.  Since Sakura is now the Captor
of the Clow Cards that Clow Reed created, the spirit
reasons that Sakura MUST know where Clow Reed is hiding...
even though Clow Reed's been dead for over a hundred years.
One word of warning--UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
should you even think of listening to the dub track.
Not only are the voices completely and totally WRONG for
every single character, but the dub script utterly destroys
the truly bittersweet ending of this film (and the moral).

When I found out they were releasing the original uncut Japanese version, I thought to myself, ""I have to get it!""

Sakura wins an all expense paid trip to Hong Kong and takes Tomoyo, Yukito and Touya with her. They run into Li and his family, along with Meiling. This movie introduces for the first time, Li Syoaran's mother and sisters, characters never seen in the anime. Both Li and Sakura must put aside their differences to battle an powerful old adversary of Clow Reed. The animation is smooth and beautiful and you can't help fall in love with these characters.

I accidently bought both the dub and undub, and I was surprized to also see it wasn't chopped up and there were no phantom chalk board writings (if you get my meaning... heheh that was very bad of nelvana ^^;) it's not as good as the tenth volume of the episodes (YEEK!) but it's still pretty good.
Take a break from Tenchi Muyo maybe and rent this, even buy it! The art and Li family are reason enough for that! But you want real cute CCS go ahead and buy volume 10: School Dayz or Volume 6 ... ^.^ Still five stars, how could I rate CCS anything under!",1029715200,,948,4.129729729729729

Basically, the plot of the movie is that Sakura has won a raffle contest to Hong Kong for her winter vacation, and there, finds her dreams to be inhabited by an evil but beautiful woman.
The film is quite enjoyable, but I don't know if one would enjoy it if they weren't Cardcaptor Sakura fans.
Warning! If you would only watch the film dubbed, don't see it. This is probably the worst dub ever, even worse than Sailor Moon. Many of the peaceful, orchestrated tracks of the original have been changed to horrible pop songs by wannabe bands, Sakura, who is meant to be cute and sweet, sounds like a full-grown woman, all of Tomoyo's (ahem 'Madison') statements of love for Sakura are changed to shopping comments, Yukito (ahem 'Julian') no longer seems weak, kind, and gentle and instead sounds like every other teenage guy in dubed anime for kids ever. Also, instead of a fortuneteller threatened by Clow Reed's effective fortunes who secretly loved him, the woman (Madoushi?) is instead a crazy, evil woman sealed by the now-super-righteous Clow Reed who wishes to rule the world (??), and the ornament he gave her for her birthday is instead some special talisman that opens a portal to another world.

1673103,4,B00005V9HE,"I've never actually seen the TV series for Card Captor Sakura.  It appeals to me, but frankly, it's a long series and quite expensive.  My friend bought this movie on a whim, though, and I borrowed it from him for my first exposure to the sugary cuteness known as Sakura.  *grin*  Loved it!
The movie itself has been summarized in several reviews, so I don't see a need for me to repeat what's been said.  Overall, the plot wasn't anything particularly special.  Cute, sweet, pretty typical shoujo (girls' anime).  That's not necessarily a bad thing, though; I thought it was rather touching.  It's made by CLAMP, anyway, and they are incapable of producing a mediocre show.  The designs are appealing, the animation is gorgeous, and there are plenty of interesting characters.  I especially loved Shaoran's sisters - it's so funny to watch them fawning over Sakura-tachi!  The only particular flaw I can name is that the movie does move rather slowly at times.  Perhaps it's simply that I'm not familiar with Sakura's style, but it seemed to drag just a bit.
In the end, watch this movie if you want something that's cute, pretty, and doesn't require much thought.  It helps to be at least a little familiar with Sakura (I had read about the characters before watching and understood it slightly better than my friend who knew nothing about the Japanese version), but the television show isn't really required.  I suggest renting it before buying, if possible; I'm not certain how it would stand up to repeated viewing.
As a side note, I shudder to think what the ""Cardcaptors: The Movie"" disc must be like.  The dub on this DVD is hailed as ""uncensored,"" but IT IS NOT.  The ending of the dub version has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese version.  It's fun to watch the movie dubbed in English with the subtitles on the screen; my friend and I were rolling on the floor in hysterics.  It's not that it's censored, exactly, because aside from a quick scene of Shaoran being jealous when Yukito buys Sakura a hair ornament, there wasn't anything *to* censor.  The dub script writers apparently took one look at the Japanese script, said ""Too mushy!"", and chucked it out the window.  It's a real pity, too, because the dub ending doesn't make that much sense and is significantly less moving.  Definitely watch it subtitled if at all possible, even if you generally prefer dubs.  You'd be surprised.",1025395200,2,2408,4.751807228915663
1673104,4,B00005V9HE,"I won't bore everyone with yet another synopsis, but I will say that this is Cardcaptor Sakura at it's best! While not action-packed, there's just enough to keep everyone interested. However the real reason to watch this is for the stunning animation of Hong Kong. The artists went all out on this one!
 My only dissapointment is that apart from meeting Li's family (in one of the films best moments), and a quick, tantalizing glimpse of Clow Reed, there really aren't any grand revelations.
 Also, this is basically nothing more than a simple childrens adventure story, so it's probably not suitable for non-Sakura fans. But for those who've fallen under the shows spell, this is pure gold.
  I've collected all of the original Japanese disks, so this is my first exposure to the english dub. With all due respect to the actors, I can see why the engish dub has such a bad reputation. Ouch! The original Japanese has so much more depth that the dub is lacking.
  Add to all that a lovely reversible cover, a special plastic pencil board of the english cover art, and a wonderful 5.1 stereo mix, and you have a must-have package for the true Sakura fan.
 Let's hope Pioneer will enentually bring us the second movie as well.
 *Note* For the sharp-eyed viewers, watch the freeway during the inclined train to Li's house scene for a fun little joke by the animators.",1024185600,3,1364,4.677824267782427

I feel sorry for those who did not like this movie and I hope that they change their minds.  Though not as action-packed as other animation movies this one is still great.  I am a bigfan of japanese animation and CardCaptors is one of my favorites.  A new japanese cartoon called Hamtaro is good so you better see that one. ...

1673106,5,B00005V9HE,"The first movie kicks off with Sakura facing off against the Arrow card, which she captures with the help of Li. Arrow plays a role in the end of the movie, and the battle also serves as a nice opening. The ball is set rolling in class as Sakura, Tomoyo, Li and Meilin await their report cards. Sakura is releived to see that she wen't well in maths, Tomoyo's is perfect as we would expect, Li  is packing himself in fear of bad marks, but is pleasantly surprised to find his marks are good enough to show his mother, Meilin is very confident that her marks will be great... however she get's a bit of a shock when she sees them, as her marks aren't to great, seeing as her Japanese isn't to great... Sakura takes part in a lottery, in whish the main prize is a trip to Hong Kong, which, by either luck or fate, Sakura wins!
While in Hong Kong they do the usual touristy things, Touya does the usual big brother things to Sakura, and Kero-chan is in shock to see what has happened to Hong Kong since he was last there (which was a very long time ago). However, Sakura's dreams continue, and while visiting a place called Bird street (a street filled with cages containing birds, strangely enough) she is led to a well by two birds who carry a stange presence, where she goes into a daze...
While its nothing groundbreaking as far as Shoujo anime goes, its Cardcaptor Sakura, so it oozes appeal and is smacking of style. The animation is wonderful and the story is quite good, and in the end, everything comes together nicely, and we get a great movie that will no doubt put a smile on your face...
Aside from the dub, I can't recommend this DVD highly enough. The quality is excellent, and the movie is great. I suggest you all do yourself a favour. Buy it. It's pure gold!",1021766400,,1773,4.324324324324325

This may seem like a 90 minute episode, but it keeps the spirit of the show alive even if it is a movie version. There are small qualities that make this movie memorable For instance, the voices of Sakura, Meilin, and Tomoyo all sound like children.
For the English version, they redid the entire audio track. There is different music and background sounds as the movie goes along. The music here comes mainly from the Cardcaptors CD. The music changes the mood of the movie. In the Japanese version the background music, provides a mysterious and sometimes cute atmosphere. For the English version the music provides a spooky and sometimes funny atmosphere. Watching the English version it made me feel like I was watching another X-Files movie with a ghost in it. Even so, the English cast did an excellent job in imitating the spirit of the character they were playing. It was still an entertaining movie.
The extras were interesting to see as there were trailers for this movie on the disk. There should have been more extras. I would rate this disk at 4.75 stars. This disk is still highly recommended.",1019692800,,1249,4.73394495412844

And I have to say, despite the fact of how much the American version of the TV series got butchered to hell and back, Nelvana did a better than average job on the english dub of this feature.  They also didn't hesitate to promote the American soundtrack CD a little by throwing in a few of the songs in the dubbed version.
The original japanese version is the highlight of course, capturing the true emotions as they are meant to be.
And finally, they put some decent extras on their CCS dvds.  After getting nothing but art galleries for the past five or so CCS dvds, we get pretty much every single promotional piece used for this movie from movie trailers to TV spots.  You can also watch this movie in standard FULL SCREEN or letter-boxed widescreen, which I always enjoy seeing on a dvd.

Both movies are 86 minutes running time and 2.0 Dolby Surround Audio.

But was this trip meerly a coincidence? Or are there other forces at work here in Hong Kong? On the first day of the trip, Sakura and Kero can feel something while walking through the Bird Street, and it seems to be coming from two birds above. Sakura runs off, to the surprise of Yukito and Touya, while Tomoyo follows her, making excuses for Sakura.
Sakura finds herself at a well after winding through the back alleys of Hong Kong. Something is calling to her, and just as she is about to give in, Syaoran appears. He and Mei-Ling are also in Hong Kon for break.
I won't spoil the rest for you, but this is a great piece. You get to see some wonderful Touya/Sakura interactions, and you get to meet Li's four older sisters. And they're nearly as bad as Mei-Ling!!!
Get this. That's all I can say. And Pioneer has gone a step further and included a pencil board of the cover of the DVD for our enjoyment. :) Ja!",1017360000,,1242,4.2893617021276595

The music went wonderful to the movie. The story was very good. I loved how we get to meet the Li family, the mother is truely wonderful and mysterious. I love the situtation of it all, Sakura being ""summoned"" to Hong Kong, when Clow Reed was really called, and meeting the lady from Sakura's dream, she is very tragic in my opinion and we could all learn something from her. I know I may not be very clear on all that I am saying, but I really don't want to give the plot away.

1673136,4,B00005V9HE,"even when she is in Hong Kong!  The movie takes place sometime near the end of the first series of Cardcaptor Sakura (episode 46).  The movie itself does not have a very compelling story but is still good in its own right.  There's not a lot of action in this movie.
Sakura wins a trip to Hong Kong so she decides to go with Tomoyo, Touya, and Yukito.  Because it's break, Li and Meiling are in Hong Kong because that is where they originally live anyway.  Sakura and Tomoyo meet up with Li and Meiling by chance and notice that they feel a strong force similar to that of a clow card.  With the help of Li's mother, they are able to uncover the source of the power which deals with a person (voiced by Megumi Hayashibara) from Clow Reed's past.  Uncover the mystery yourself as you by this DVD.
The DVD comes with an amazing reversible cover provided by Pioneer Animation.  The front cover is the English version with a close up of Sakura holding her key in nice Chinese clothes in front of the beautiful Hong Kong night depicting its bright lights and beautiful harbor.  The reversed cover is what seems to be the original Japanese DVD cover.  It shows Sakura in a battle costume made my Tomoyo with cute Kero-chan on her hat.  There are pictures of the whole cast of the movie (Tomoyo, Li, Meiling, Touya & Yukito, Li's four sisters, Li's mother) in outines of Sakura/Cherry Blossoms surrounding her.  This is a great addition to the DVD packaging and something that is becoming more common among DVD publishers.  Pioneer has done so with Gatekeepers and ADV with the Rurouni Kenshin OAVs.
This DVD does come with 5.1 and 2.0 Dolby Mix for BOTH English and Japanese voice tracks.  This movie is also unedited, which is targeted for the anime fans.  Pioneer promises to include as extras the following: Japanese promotional theatrical trailers, commercials, alterate angle footage, and more.
Final Note:  This movie has amazing detail of the Hong Kong environment.  While no Cantonese is ever spoken in the movie, the essense of Hong Kong is brought about in this movie.  I praise Hong Kong just as Jackie Chan did in the extras for the Rush Hour 2 DVD.",1013299200,25,2155,4.582245430809399

7956188,1,B00005V9HE,"Though there have been several anime series that have had some form of success in America, the show that should have been the biggest thing for girls since Barbie should have been ""Cardcaptor Sakura."" An adorable show about a girl trying to reclaim powers that have been (accidently) let loose, the show came to America as ""Cardcaptors,"" and the poor quality of the dubbing, re-writes, and changed music resulted in the American public giving the show a collected shrug of indifference. ""Cardcaptor Sakura's"" future in America was ruined, but not before the movies came out. The first movie arrived as ""Cardcaptors: The Movie,"" and it was just as quickly dismissed for it's poor quality. Thankfully, the uncut version found it's way to America as ""Cardcaptor Sakura: The Movie,"" and the world would get one more chance to discover why Hollywood retired the title ""The Movie"" many years ago.

Taking place somewhere between episodes 34 and 35, ""Cardcaptor Sakura: The Movie"" revolves around Sakura as she and her friend Tomoyo win a trip to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong they run into rival/love interest Li Syaoran and his bratty fianc Meiling. This sets up an hour of Sakura meeting Li's sisters, mother, and butler. The longer running time for the movie also provides viewers with a chance to watch the characters shop more then they normally would. Throughout the first hour of the film there is some question whether or not Sakura's winning the trip was really ""by chance,"" as some evil power looms over them throughout the movie. But enough with the power, did you know that in Japan movie watchers are okay with watching a reoccurring dream five times in a single movie?

See, the issue with ""Cardcaptor Sakura: The Movie"" is a simple one, and it's none of the reasons a viewer would typically have with a movie like this. Yes, I suppose some caution could be thrown out that this is a movie ""for the fans,"" and that non-fans are not welcome, but I think this movie fails because it's trying NOT to be for the fans! The movie spends a stupid amount of time setting everything up for people who are not familiar with the material, that it all falls flat. The villain gets the rare privilege to be both the strongest AND weakest link in the film! The strongest because her scenes are the only time the movie justifies it's bigger budget, and weakest because her motivations and history amount to a big amount of nothingness. Note to aspiring screen writers: If a movie needs an hour of padding before anything significant happens then you don't have a movie.

I know many reviews of this nature state that a movie like this is an overlong TV episode, and I'm going to agree with one exception: This could have, and should have, BEEN a TV episode! Seriously, with some editing of the script, not relocating the characters to Hong Kong (which stills looks like Japan strangely enough), and eliminating the first card capture of the film, then this story could have been told on TV instead of on the big screen. Though ""Cardcaptor Sakura: The Movie"" is not a movie you're likely to hate, you are likely to be very bored with it. The more familiar you are with the material, the more likely your chances to be bored.

P.S. As a side note, drop one and a half stars if you plan to watch the English only, pan-and-scan ""Cardcaptors: The Movie."" Trust me on this folks: It's eevvviiiiillllll.
