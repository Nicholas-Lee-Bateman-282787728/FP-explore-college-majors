8308497,5,B001HBUTAC,"This is Carol Butler's son writing this review.  I found this video at Thriftko (which, as you can guess is a thrift store), the other day and just had to buy it.  I was very surprised at how good the quality was considering that that shows were from 1952 and the video itself was from 1985.  I would've thought that it would be very bad seeing as how the tape is 24 years old now.  But,  I love it.  I have the episodes that are included on this tape on DVD, but I like them on VHS too.

Episodes:
1) Jack Benny and Humphrey Bogart.
2) Jack Benny and Bob Hope.  (Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis make a cameo at the end.)",1254787200,,617,4.0
