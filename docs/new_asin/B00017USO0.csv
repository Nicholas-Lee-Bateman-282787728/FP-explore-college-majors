1975988,5,B00017USO0,If you plan on buying a class A RV this is for sure one of the DVD's you MUST have. He goes through each and every area of space on the Class A. Sure the RV might not be just like yours but if you have a Class A all the major stuff in yours will be on this video.

It's well made good information for new people on RV.

Video and comments are good and easy to understand.

Good general opration video for RV.",1359763200,,147,4.576923076923077
1975990,3,B00017USO0,"As videos go, this might not have the production quality required for airing on ""PBS"" or ""Discovery Channel,"" but if you want to learn the basics of what makes a Class A Recreational Vehicle (RV) tick, you'll find this video quite helpful.

Host Mark Polk does a very good job of walking the viewer through the various key components and systems of an RV.  RV's are pretty complex machines, and Polk breaks it down with easy to follow explanations supported by good closeup shots of the particular component under discussion.  I found the sections on the electrical and wastewater systems to be particularly helpful.",1332633600,3,616,4.903846153846154
8007592,3,B00017USO0,This dvd is totally identical to the 'RV Education 101: The RV Orientation' dvd but without the gas efficiency bonus feature at the end. I'd recommend the RV Educ. 101 vs this dvd that's why only 3 stars.,1492560000,,204,4.394736842105263

8007595,4,B00017USO0,It was very informative on how a RV works. The only thing I disliked was the video quality. It was over exposed and grainy.  The copyright was 2006 so it maybe not very high quality.,1461110400,,182,4.2

8007597,3,B00017USO0,Even though I was new to motorhomes I found this was too basic.  But for someone completely new to any type of hands on repair this might be useful initially.,1411948800,,158,4.266666666666667

8007600,5,B00017USO0,"After my husband's death I knew I would like to continue with my FMCA chapter (The Lincoln Lander's) and now needed to know how to hook-up & disconnect my motor home. I had to learn all the things my husband did if I was going to continue RV traveling with my two little Maltese dogs who also enjoy RVing! This DVD has helped me so much! I keep referring back to it at times just so I'm not forgetting anything and it always travels with me.
Thank you so much for taking the time to put this together. Anyone just starting out will be greatly helped by this DVD.",1390780800,2,562,4.165137614678899
