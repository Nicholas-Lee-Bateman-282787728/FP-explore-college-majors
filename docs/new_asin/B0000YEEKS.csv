8004394,3,B0000YEEKS,"It was ok, it was a VHS recording and not a modern version of Children Stories From Africa.  Not really what I was expecting in regards to quality.",1429488000,,147,4.25
8004395,5,B0000YEEKS,"Nandi Nyembe is a story-teller.  She knows how to draw you into the story and get excited about it. Although this DVD is Nyembe telling children's stories (How the Baboon Got a Kink in His Tail, etc.) she is so good at it that you want to hear more of the stories. The DVD also highlights preschool children singing and dancing at the end of each story.  Like Aesop's Fables, the Children's Stories From Africa all have a moral or lesson to learn about greed, friendship, kindness, etc.  I plan to use this in my history classes when we study Africa. My middle school and high school students were not too keen on watching something geared for preschoolers. However, after watching volume one, they voted to also watch volume two.",1362182400,2,730,4.6
8004396,5,B0000YEEKS,"Coming from Johannesburg, I was delighted to come across this collection. Fabulous. There are wonderful stories, expertly told and will delight young and old.",1358985600,,158,5.625
8004397,4,B0000YEEKS,"My daughter is just over 3 yrs. and I wanted some story-telling with an African flavour.

I discovered this DVD online and  so I purchased it.  Both I and my daughter really enjoyed the stories.  The story teller was quite animated and interesting to listen to.  I like the fact that every story has a moral message and at the end of every story there is a song.  I think the songs really help to reinforce the learning and help the children to remember the messages easily.",1355702400,,474,4.390804597701149
8004398,5,B0000YEEKS,"My husband is Rwandan/Somali, and my daughter is often asking about Africa. I thought this would be a good help on that front, and bought it for her 4th birthday. In the two days since we've received it, she's probably watched about 10 times. She absolutely loves it, and the stories are entertaining. I definitely recommend this purchase.",1338768000,2,339,4.862068965517241
8004399,5,B0000YEEKS,"My 2-year old son absolutely, positively loves these tapes. When he wakes up in the morning he stretches and asks for the ""dancing lady."" He tries to say some of the African worlds. And boy does he try to dance along. He can't twist his hips like the little children in the tape but he shakes his head in time to the music. My care provider enjoys the stories and music also. I love them too. This video series is a must for any child, regardless of ethnicity. It is a must for any parent who realizes that his/her child will grow up the ""global village."" Thank you, Nandi",1052265600,4,572,4.256880733944954
