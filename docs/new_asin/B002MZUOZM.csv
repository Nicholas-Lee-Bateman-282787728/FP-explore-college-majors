These measly reviews are fake...the movie has been out for nearly a year and only 3 reviews? That should tell you something!",1296777600,2,263,4.739130434782608

Considering the pittance that this really entertaining and inventive film took to make, it is very much a minor miracle of a film. Everything from the direction and stylized shots to the soundtrack, score and overall quality is amazing. Apparently the budget was around 25k!!! Well for that I would have expected a b-list feature length soap with wooden acting and poorly lit sets. I was very surprised to be totally engrossed in the film and had no 'niggles' in my mind like 'that looked cheap', 'that sound was dodgy' and so on. In fact it was the opposite. The shots were excellent and interesting, the rock soundtrack was superb, the script flowed extremely well and the plot was intelligent. It reminded me a little of a really good quality, contemporary, feature length version of 'Tales Of The Unexpected' mixed with a Hammer House Of Horror film and it felt like 'something a bit different' from horror movies that have been released recently which I have found boring with little imagination.
The performances from every member of the cast were excellent with a lot of variation in characters. Mike Instone came across very well indeed as the cheeky Brummie with a heart ( a heart of gold or a cut out of the chest beating heart with a knife in it??? Go see it and find out!).Also Katrin Riedel-Kelly did a great job of a very spooky and quirky loon.but overall the acting performances were spotless.
I thought that the effects in the film were very good and not too 'over the top' and the guts and gore were very convincing.
The mainly rock soundtrack suited the movie perfectly and drove the plot along with gusto and the score was very well done indeed and created the right tense atmosphere.
Overall, I think this movie has got the chance to become a real cult hit.
25k for this!! Miracles do happen.",1258416000,2,1892,4.698795180722891

8374333,4,B002MZUOZM,The acting wasn't bad at all. The script was pretty good with only a few holes that could have easily been filled with a bigger budget.  It kept me interested throughout the entire movie.,1456704000,,187,4.5
8374334,2,B002MZUOZM,"I couldn't get through this movie. Usually I'll find something redeeming to get it a three star rating, but not this one. It's just boring. The story would be great with some special effects. The setting is nice but there are too many close shots, it becomes a bunch of ""talking heads"" with no talent but to memorize script. The acting is stilted with some of the actors reading their lines from cue cards. If your going to do so many close shots, then get the make up artist to at least trim some eyebrows.",1456531200,,507,4.347368421052631

8374337,3,B002MZUOZM,"Not a bad horror movie based on the idea of ""Folk horror."" It is British and a little scary with some fairly gruesome scenes. Herne the Hunter is portrayed as being ""something"" supernatural; and he is. Not the deity I'd expected to see. Some fun scenes are in here and some of the actors were pretty good.",1454630400,,305,4.368421052631579

8374340,3,B002MZUOZM,"I actually watched the film to the end.  The film is very low budget and it was entertaining.  It's not that the acting was bad, because it was not. It's not the story is bad either, I just kept getting the feeling that the cast were members of a community playhouse or something. It would have been better suited to stage than film.  Not everyone who really watches it will even rate it a three.  I didn't read any of the reviews before hand, and I am a Prime Member so there was no charge to watch the film.  However, for those of you who have to pay to see this film, you have been warned.  You  may not like it at all.",1453507200,,622,4.008130081300813
8374341,2,B002MZUOZM,"Ralph (Don McCorkindale) leads a documentary crew in search of a legendary character known as Herne the Hunter. Ralph is an expert on the subject, and wishes to continue the research begun by his sister Caroline, who was brutally murdered during her attempt. The group stays at an old manor house, owned by Caroline's life-partner, Gabriella (Angelique Fernandez). At first, everything goes swimmingly. Ralph entertains and educates everyone w/ ghostly stories of he and Caroline's personal encounters w/ Herne. However, events take a bizarre turn, as mysterious, supernatural encounters occur. Hideous deaths soon follow. CALL OF THE HUNTER is a micro-budget ($25 thousand!) horror film from the UK. Even after economic constraints are taken into account, the overall movie is rather silly, causing scenes of ""terror"" to bring giggles instead of shivers. For example, when the title character is finally revealed, his horned-hoody look makes him more hilarious than haunting! Another annoyance is the ""heavy metal"" soundtrack. The blaring music fits none of the scenes in which it's used! This adds a great deal to the movie's cheeeze-factor. While not a complete abomination, I can't imagine watching it again...",1423267200,4,1214,5.428571428571429
