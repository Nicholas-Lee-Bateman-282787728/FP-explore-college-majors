8472431,3,B00005BAIV,"Is this movie really so rare?  I can't believe that one of my favorite early Sunday morning ""creature feature"" classics is now so hard to find!  Haven't found a copy to evaluate, hence only ""3"" stars, but would like to. For those who may not remember, a great circa 1950's Sci-Fi flick, with space-travelers stranded on a space station that becomes host to an invasive species.  Kind of like ""Alien,"" only this alien is an infectious moss brought on board by a traveler who succumbs, then the entire space station crew must fight for survival as the moss grows and grows . . .  For special effects and horrific scenes, this one certainly rates higher than many of the B-grade dogs (like the original ""Thing,"" or ""It"" for instance) that have been re-released.  Would love to see a nice re-issue come out someday.",1255824000,4,811,4.643356643356643
8472432,5,B00005BAIV,"William Leslie (the star) is my Grandfather.  Since he just passed away in December, I am trying to gather together as many of his old movies as I can.  This one has been impossible to find.  If anyone could help me out I would really appreciate it.  Also, I am looking for a movie called,""The Couch"" and another called, ""The Night the World Exploded"". PLEASE HELP!",1147132800,4,365,4.484848484848484
