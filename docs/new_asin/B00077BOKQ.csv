8045593,3,B00077BOKQ,"Storyline should have been great and it needed a stronger director to see the promise in the making of this show.  This is an amazing movie with so much going for it but it is missing that special touch. The actors didn't seem interested, so they rolled along making it an B grade movie when it could have been an A grade. I sit and watch so that is my own opinion. Pro's are targeted by a serial killer and there seems to be that punch to keep the ball rolling, trying to keep you amused. There is a bit of action and I liked Tom's part the best with a bit of comedy thrown in.  They seem to try and put everything into it and it wasn't needed. You are not getting a fabulous movie like Independence Day but it's watchable when nothing better on, so pick up the popcorn relax to the chair placing your feet up and judge for yourself. Enjoy!",1393891200,2,841,4.121951219512195
8045594,2,B00077BOKQ,"How could a movie w/ this cast be so bloody boring? Action legend, Fred Williamson (FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) is a private detective out to catch a mysterious murderer. At first, all is well, as a serial-killer begins dispatching victims. Unfortunately, this story gets bogged down in several dull side / sub-plots, winding up a meandering wreck. Gary Busey (SILVER BULLET, PREDATOR 2) has little to do as Williamson's partner. Robert Forster (ALLIGATOR, JACKIE BROWN) pops in occasionally as a cop. Peter Fonda (EASY RIDER, RACE WITH THE DEVIL) couldn't be more wooden if he were a log cabin. Stella Stevens (POSEIDON ADVENTURE, MONSTER IN THE CLOSET) though as beautiful as ever, has no real reason to be in this movie. Henry Silva (ALLIGATOR, THIRST) is actually convincing in his role as a crimelord. Too bad he's only in the movie for 30 seconds! The breath-takingly stunning Vanity (52 PICK UP) plays Williamson's ex-wife w/ all the enthusiasm of a door-stop. NIGHT CALLER is an action / thriller without much action and absolutely no thrills. Blecch!...",1261612800,2,1055,5.0
8045595,5,B00077BOKQ,"Two ex-football players concentrate on living the good life in Miami. In their spare time, they're private eyes, but their partying lifestyles are thrown for a loop when they accept a mysterious challenge from an exotic beauty... Fred Williamson features the action star as a cigar-smoking detective named Mac Derringer. He is enlisted by his ex-wife (Vanity), a phone-sex operator, to catch the masked psychopath who murdered her co-worker. With the aid of partner Gary Busey and friend Peter Fonda, Derringer closes in on the maniac, but is soon framed for murder. Williamson has an interracial love scene, there's a stoolie who raps, and a subplot involves blackmail and pornography. The Jeffersons' Isabel Sanford appears as Derringer's mother, and the familiar genre cast features Stella Stevens, Robert Forster, and Henry Silva.
