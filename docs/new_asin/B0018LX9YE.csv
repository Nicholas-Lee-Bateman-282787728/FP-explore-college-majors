3417635,5,B0018LX9YE,"I have been doing Tae bo for over 3 years .I love the new Taebo t3 pure power,it is an excellent workout for advanced as well as for beginners. I do not enjoy the Ignition,acceleration and transformation because it takes too long just to teach the moves. But I think it is good for beginners. I do taebo3-4 times and a week. There is no other workouts like taebo. I agree with the earlier reviewer about the time spent for instructions at the beginning of each workout,I just skip it and go straight to the workout. I have lost 5 pounds in 4 weeks. Go Taebo .Thank you Billy,Shelly and the taebo team.",1227657600,6,601,4.327433628318584
3417636,5,B0018LX9YE,"This DVD set is the best.  It is a little advance but once you get the moves right you can do their advance calendar training.
I disagree with the review that says the first DVD ""Ignition"" is just instructional.  I still do it because it allows me to focus on the moves and the best thing about it is that even 60 minutes of going over the moves I still sweat a lot.
Also Billy adds a 10 minutes of move review at the beginning of each workout DVD this way you don't have to view the first one to understand how a move is done.
I do taebo 6 times a week with a strict nutrition plan.  I've lost 72lbs in 10 monhts.  Taebo was the only thing that gave me my body back after a pregnancy where I gained 50lbs.",1225238400,26,706,3.9507042253521125
3417637,1,B0018LX9YE,"I really disappointed today's shopping .
I do not recommend this item beause of wrong discription this item.
I recheked svmproduct web site and find big fault.
Main problem is as follwing.

1. You mentioned product discription throug your web site,
  each part of the workout discs are 63min. 53min. and 58min.

2. You mentioned workout called ignition,acceleration,transformation are
  separately on each discs or complete version.

3. On your product, it is not a ignition, just for ignition express.

4. Also each workout or discs with word or phases of express.

5.with express means just a information or introduction partly and around 20min. length.

5. I guess this product is not a big different between  yours and
  sell by billy blanks.com

6. I guess this product is a same as other one sold by amazon.com

I will request this shop for refund due to any fault of svmproduct.
I do not want further trouble with any customer.",1224288000,,934,4.859872611464968
3417638,4,B0018LX9YE,"I have been using Tae Bo T3 for 90 days, and this is definitely a great workout. Advanced users may not like it, it is more like the earlier Tae Bo videos in it's execution. Some of the differences between this and earlier Tae Bo workouts is the addition of a 1lb hand weight, and the focus on staying in your core for certain moves. Both of these changes really ramp up the workout. The only negative I have about the set is the first DVD, Ignition, is just a long ""how to"" video which explains all of the moves in detail for 40 minutes, followed by a 15 minute workout. This is fine except that this routine is cool to do a couple of times, but it is then incorporated into the schedule, which was unnecessary. The other drawback is that every DVD starts with a 10 minute recap of all of the moves before you get into the workout, after a while I found myself just fast forwarding through this to get to the workout. All in all though this is an excellent set and a great addition to my Tae bo collection. I will definitely be working out with these DVD as part of my daily routine and would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a good solid workout.",1220745600,44,1160,4.20627802690583
3417639,3,B0018LX9YE,"I am trying to get back into shape. And the way this is advertised is that it starts slow and works its way up. If that first workout is slow, forget it! I can't keep up, and I just quit trying. What I can keep up with is fun though. If it wasn't so humiliating trying to keep up with this thing I would keep going. I hear the original Tae Bo is more oriented to beginners / those like me that are out of shape...

I don't want to discourage anyone from trying this. It IS fun, and it really does help. I just want a slower start / workup to the speed they are going so folks like me can catch up without the rude reminder that we got fat and not so limber / fast....",1270944000,,667,3.8333333333333335
3417640,3,B0018LX9YE,I'm a big fan of Billy's Teabo training. I've been working out with is different workouts  for the past 10 years. Taebo 3T is like the old Taebo with 1pound weights. I was expecting upgraded workouts. This is more for beginner.,1260144000,2,227,4.536585365853658
3417641,5,B0018LX9YE,Tha DVD was in great shape and I receved faster than I thouth I would.,1260057600,,70,3.7333333333333334
3417642,1,B0018LX9YE,"I have done taebo in the past, such as taebo amped.  I thought that this one was a step up, but I was sadly mistaken.  he constantly talked and talked. I barely broke a sweat.  He paused way too long between each exercise.  Also, each dvd starts off with a demo of how to do the moves.  I fast forward that part.  It may be good for someone who has never done taebo before, not for me though.",1259193600,3,392,3.9615384615384617
3417643,5,B0018LX9YE,"This product was exactly as advertised on Amazon. Delivery was fast, so overall purchase experience was great. The video, I just started exercising to the video this week. I think it is an amazing product. I am in poor physical condition hence I bought this video. The first invigorate video I'm watching is challenging, but at the same time I am able to accomplish feeling very good. The funny thing is the third time watching the workout seems to be even more intense as my body begins the transformation.",1258156800,,507,4.707865168539326
3417644,5,B0018LX9YE,"Billy is just awesome.  This is the only workout I do.  I have several of his other DVDs and believe me, you will be breathless again...and sweating! Great workout!",1257206400,,164,4.620689655172414
3417645,3,B0018LX9YE,"So I just got this set in the mail and I tried the first two DVDs:  The Ignition one with all that other stuff on it and the Dedication one.  There is just way too much talking I was so annoyed throughout the video.  I understand that he wants you to get the form right but he doesn't need to tell you to stop so many times.  It just drops your heart rate down, and a lot of the time you're just standing there listening to him spouting his annoying workout philosophy to you.  I wish he would just do it, we're not idiots we can mirror what he's doing.  Yes I did sweat, but I didn't get as much of a cardio workout as I would have wanted in these first two DVDs.  I fastforwarded a lot of it and by the time I finished, two hours had gone by and I still felt I didn't get a good workout.  I don't have the time to listen to him rant; less talking and more doing.  I hope the other two DVDs are more intense with more movement rather than Billy telling you to stop so we can listen to his verbose explanations.  On a side note, there's a girl who is always yelling and screaming in the video (I think it's his daughter).  It's another annoying thing that I have to put up with  while working out.

I am editing this review after doing the empowerment and commitment DVDs for a month and I have to say his workouts are really good.  They definitely make you sweat and you are tired, but it is doable and attainable.  I think that the first 2 DVDs are a waste for me, but they are very informative for someone that is completely new to taebo or any form of a defense workout.  If you can stand listening through his explanations in the first two DVDs you will learn a lot.  If you just want to skip to the workout, fastforward the first ten minutes of the empowerment and commitment DVDs because they are just reviews of the moves.  Overall, great cardio workout and it doesn't bulk me up like the ""The Firm Bootcamp"" DVD. The hand weights help tone your arms while doing cardio.  And his daughter yelling all the time?  I turn down the TV, tune her out, and put on my own music. :)",1243468800,6,2081,4.103960396039604
3417646,3,B0018LX9YE,"I really love Billy Blanks and think he is an inspiration to those wanting to be fit. I've had this DVD set for a few weeks and haven't really gotten past the first one yet. It seems like a good workout once you know the moves, but I have a hard time following since I'm not familiar with Tae Bo. Even in the first workout, the moves are very fast paced, and I notice I tend to get sloppy and not do the movement correctly trying to keep up. It's also hard to try to mimic the movement because facing the screen you are doing everything on the opposite side, and I find myself trying to move in the same direction as the people on the TV. I was hoping that this set would be a good introduction to Tae Bo, but feel it would be better if the first workout was slower and focused more on correct form rather than speed.",1242777600,,817,4.049382716049383
3417647,4,B0018LX9YE,"I have done several Tae Bo series and enjoy them very much. I'm not in shape (my fault for lack of consistency) but I keep coming back to Tae Bo because it's so convenient and so much fun.

The main differences in this series compared to the others is the weights - which are very well designed - and the focus on what Billy calls the 'core' workout. It basically means taking a deep horse stance or cat stance while doing the upper body moves. This effectively combines strength training and cardio simultaneously and is great for glute and thigh muscle development. However, if you are subject to knee twinges (like me) you will have to be careful or you may get some knee pains that will last a couple of days (like I did).

Be aware of your limitations and avoid injury.",1242259200,4,774,4.405594405594406
3417648,5,B0018LX9YE,Billy does it again! This dvd will surely work your legs! It is a very intense workout and I would suggest that those new to Tae Bo try other workouts before they use this dvd. A great workout for weight loss but extremely intense and mostly working your legs and core area!,1240099200,,274,4.288461538461538
3417649,5,B0018LX9YE,"If you are a Tae Bo fan, then you will really enjoy this DVD. There are different tapes that get harder as you progress to the next one. The hand weights are a great addition, and he has come up with some new moves to challenge you.  The only down side is that the DVD starts with the intro and once you have seen it, you have to fast forward to get to the workout each time.  I wish that they had a separate DVD then you wouldn't have to do that, otherwise I really like it.  It is also nice to see the old faces that we have grown to love, like his daughter Shelly, the trainers and some new ones.  Billy is as energetic as he has always been.  I Love the workout.",1239580800,,666,3.903703703703704
3417650,4,B0018LX9YE,"I think Billy Blanks' TaeBo is the best exercise program out there. I have had many of his videos. Frankly, I do not stick with the program consistently and go for stretches without exercising, but I blame that on me not the program. I always get back with it. It DOES work IF you stick with it.

Billy Blanks has a great way of encouraging you. It is as if he is talking right to you, and you don't like to let him down! A reviewer below does not like all the talking. I do. He talks more than he does in his early videos, and I get inspiration and motivation from it.

Thank you Billy Blanks!",1238284800,3,594,4.068376068376068
3417651,5,B0018LX9YE,"I absolutely love this DVD set.  Billy Blanks is awesome. My husband and I have doing the workout 5 times a week and I see the results. I recommend this set. You will see the transformation, also listen to the words that Billy speaks, refreshing.",1237507200,,246,4.466666666666667
3417652,3,B0018LX9YE,I love Billy Blanks but I found all the starting and stopping very distracting. He actually tells you to stop and listen to him. I would have liked it better if it was just a solid workout.,1236211200,2,189,4.135135135135135
3417653,3,B0018LX9YE,"MY ORIGINAL RATING FOR THESE WORKOUTS WAS ONLY A 3, BUT I WOULD NOW LIKE TO CHANGE IT TO A FIVE.
I have many TaeBo videos and I love the fact that they start off with a warmup, then workout, then cool down. Billy's new videos do not do this immediately. He introduces the moves and the form on the first disk and then each of the other 3 workout disks start out with lengthy reviews of the moves and talking. At first I didn't realize you could skip through all the talking and review of the moves and go straight to the workout portion. I thought that the ""Express"" workout was the entire workout, but it turns out this is similar to previous TaeBo 8 minute workouts. There is a good full 35 minutes of each workout.

What I really like about these videos is the use of weights (even though they are way too big for my little hands and when you sweat even a little they get very slippery), and the fact that it is not impossible to do these workouts. Previous Billy Blank's videos have made my hips and knees pop and crunch - some of the moves I have never been able to do! These videos are more friendly for my nearing-40 joints. But there are still some moves that it is difficult to do properly when he speeds them up.

Unlike previous TaeBo videos, there is not one workout of these 3 that leaves me completely out of breath. BUT I am always sore the next day, and I think that the cardio keep my heart rate up in the target range most of the time. Even after only doing the workouts for 2 weeks, I see some changes in my deltoids, triceps, and glutes. I think that these are the best Taebo workouts yet.",1235865600,31,1609,4.170418006430868
3417654,4,B0018LX9YE,I love these dvds unfortunately i hate the 15 minute warmup. I wish all of the dvds included the full workout. But worth the money.,1235260800,,131,4.28
3417655,5,B0018LX9YE,"T3 for me has been a wonderful turn around.  I used Billy Blanks back in 98 it took 6 months of workouts to drop 45 pounds.  I looked okay. But NOW WOW I have been lazy and this T3 workout after one month of watching what I eat, still snacking but smarter. I have managed to drop 13 pounds in one month. No special pills or really counting calories, just getting up in the mornings and working out two days on and one day off. I am still just on the Ignition express and first cd but the difference is amazing. My mind, my spirit and my weight have changed.  If you are not sure what to do, try it. He does explain every move prior to each workout and for me that is just fine. Do the moves correctly and just pay attention to what you eat, don't starve yourself and you too can see a difference in a short time.  Good Luck, I love it....40 pounds to go still that is my goal. Whats yours? :)",1234483200,4,892,3.99438202247191
3417656,1,B0018LX9YE,The workout is great for someone who is already in shape and is under 30. I am well over 30 and I though that I could do this. No way! I got 20 min. into the routine and had to stop. Mr. Blank is a good motivator. I wish he would do a routine geared for the rest of us who may not be in rock hard condition but want to be toned and healthy.,1234137600,,340,3.546666666666667
3417657,5,B0018LX9YE,"It's a powerful, super fat-blasting workout.  Be sure to go through each dvd so that you will build your strength for the next level.  I love it!  I worked up a good sweat.  Although, Billy makes you wanna kick in the TV while he's ""motivating"" you during the exercise, you will feel so rewarded when the results begin to show.  I recommend it to any and everyone!",1231804800,3,364,4.373134328358209
3417658,5,B0018LX9YE,"Awesome.  Really.  You do have to fast forward past the instruction part, but if you have a ""next"" button on your dvd player, you should be able to skip that part entirely and go right to the workout.  Second the workout itself is really good.  He teaches you good form, so that you don't flail your arms around mindlessly.  You may have to modify (ie: shorten the range of motion), but if you at least try to keep up, you'll get the benefit.  He has better cuing and is not as ""dyslexic"" as in previous taebo's.  You really feel like he is talking to you!  Third, the weights feel good in your hands.  They don't ""cook"" your palms like gloved-weights, and they are designed perfectly for these excercises.  Fourth, I like this series better than Get Ripped because here Billy concentrates on form and function.  Fifth, Jillian who appeared in get ripped looks great, and Shelley his daughter is radiant as always.",1231459200,7,914,4.580246913580247
8269972,4,B0018LX9YE,"This is a great workout, though I would prefer somewhat less of the choreography. The main pluspoint of this series of workout is the focus on the core. This also contains a weakness - for those of us plagued by weak knees. Go slow during the first five times you do the workout, and don't bother about the double speed. Take it easy.
The weights - not available in Europe - are not really essential and can be easily replaced by two small taiji balls -",1513555200,,453,4.27906976744186
8269973,5,B0018LX9YE,Great workouts at a great price! Would recommend to anyone looking for variety in their workouts! Gives a great cardio workout!,1492732800,,127,5.095238095238095
8269974,5,B0018LX9YE,This is my second set of Billy Blanks DVDs. You simply can't go wrong. It is a good workout- I mean a good workout. It is worth the money. I have never been disappointed with my purchase from this exercise guru. Thanks!,1430697600,,219,4.238095238095238
8269975,4,B0018LX9YE,"I dig it. The moves are relatively easy to comprehend, but sometimes you have to double take to really understand how they're doing something in a specific way, but mostly it's okay because they go over the moves a lot. I love how they incorporate some people that aren't TOTALLY RIPPED but maybe have some chub, because they can do it so then I can do it. Billy Blanks is so likeable, and sometimes when all he's saying is ""Ya, come one, you can do it, good job, keep going"", you can't help but laugh which helps you through it. It doesn't feel like you're totally exhausting your body like other programs, and you can keep going throughout the entire video and still be sweating buckets. Only worry I have is that when doing the kicks and punches, there's no guidance on how you shouldn't bang your joints, but have resistance to keep that from happening, which they do in P90X. Overall, really good, I like it more than the gym, and I will keep doing it.",1408579200,,957,4.4124293785310735
8269976,2,B0018LX9YE,"I liked the workouts but the constant talking, and stopping the exercise to talk about it, got to be too aggravating. It's fine the first time or 2 but after you know the moves, it's just downright annoying. And all of the workouts are like this. I'm moving on to something more fast paced.",1402012800,,290,4.388888888888889

8269978,5,B0018LX9YE,I forget how much cardio is involved with TaeBo... Great workout.  Recommend to anyone who needs 45 minutes of cardio,1362787200,,117,4.85
8269979,5,B0018LX9YE,"This is a mid intense kind of workout which focus a lot in toning your arms and mid section since most of the time you are in doing your moves in core not standing totally straight up but vending your knees to focus in your legs and mid section.
I personally enjoy it but I do combine it with other Tae-bo programs.
Most of people all they do is complain about these DVD's but you need to give some to get some and change your body and attitude.",1338854400,,445,4.068181818181818
8269980,5,B0018LX9YE,"I love this great workout set. But the only bad thing is that the Power Within workouts are to short and to easy form me!! But great for beginners and people who want's to get back in shape. The other people should do the Pure Power workouts. These workouts are realy great. During the Pure Power workouts, you use the T3-weights. These weights are wonderfull. Every workout has at the begining a technical review.
You get six workouts on for DVDs plus Billy's Sensei learn the moves. You also get a booklet with to workout rotation calendar's and something else.
A other great workout set from Billy Blanks.
I also give five stars for this set.",1317427200,,645,4.568965517241379
8269981,4,B0018LX9YE,Bought this product used. First cd has 3 series of short workouts which are not my style but other 3 cds are really good. I'm getting in shape already. Would recommend cause Billy Blanks really knows what he is doing.,1314403200,,217,4.45
