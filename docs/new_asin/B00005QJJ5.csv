I rushed home to watch Holiday In The Sun which I found to be amazing. Fun, outgoing and closer to their age. I happen to be two weeks older than Mary-Kate & Ashley so I love how their movies relate to our age. The location was beautiful, the plot was fun and the guys were HOT! This video is a must and #1 on my Christmas list!",1006819200,13,485,3.909090909090909

1649362,3,B00005QJJ5,"I watched this movie once or twice and loved it when I was younger, so I decided to buy this movie for my 7 year old daughter. Well watching this as an adult. I saw a lot of problems wrong with this movie and my daughter could point out flaws too. Still we both love it in its corny and cheesy way. Although I have to point out the ending plot could have been introduced a little earlier into the film and it could have ended better. This movie could have done without Scott, the ditzy surf dude, also it would have been better if they had more of an incounter with the rich brat Brianna Wallace to make the plot more interesting. A guy named Griffin a childhood friend of theirs spent his whole vaction watching Maddison (Mary-Kate) the girl he has a crush on kind of creepy. The parents of Griffin (his mother) acting was terrible and non believable. One point in the film, they left their younger daughter in the hotel alone to watch a telletubby marathon while all of them are out eating. There are plenty more mistakes, but we still love this movie.

1649384,1,B00005QJJ5,"The way this movie fell into my lap is definitely not the norm. I am not a pre-teen girl, and, in fact I generally detest precocious teens. Please understand this caveat prior to reading the review.

Let me explain.

I was at a store that sells discounted books and movies, to purchase an entirely different item altogether (""Designing Production Safety Systems"" by William G. Boyle, if you must know) when I began chatting with the clerk about a hobby of mine: I like bad movies, and have a friend who does as well. I went on to reveal that we had an ever-escalating challenge to top the previous entry in our contest for sheer badness. She said ""Well I have the movie for you; I've seen this actually, and can highly recommend it to you,"" as she slipped a copy of ""Holiday in the Sun"" across the counter. Not being a fan of the Olsen twins I asked ""How bad is it?"" She replied ""Really bad. You'll win the contest...but I wonder what you'll get in return."" As I paid my $3.18 for it, she said ""That's money well spent...enjoy."" Since I had just watched David Hasselhoff wrestle CGI snakes in ""Anaconda 3"" I thought I was in pretty good shape for this one. Wrong! I am used to B-movies from around the world (Sci-fi movies about mutant worms, chickens, and turkeys? Check. Wrestling movies from Turkey? Check.) Nothing prepared me for the horror of the teenage comedic-romance-drama-resort promotion genre, however.

Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are two cute girls who have no real acting ability, and appeal mainly to pre-teens (especially girls) who envy children even more spoiled then themselves. In this film, Mary-Kate and Ashley finish a term in school and are whisked by their parents to the Atlantis Resort in Nassau, Bahamas. You will probably grasp pretty quickly that this is really a convergence of two equally heinous concepts right away: a teenage romantic adventure, and a cross-promotional advertisement for the Atlantis (you can't miss the blatant advertisement at the beginning, or the fact that they conveniently make it to about every activity the Atlantis provides to tourists.) Because their life is so hard (the girls are being flown to Nassau in their own private Gulfstream jet, and chauffeured in stretch limousines) they pout that they aren't going to Hawaii with their friends because they have, after all, worked hard in school and deserve this. (I taste bile.) Of course, once in Nassau they immediately declare it's even better than Hawaii (no it's not,) and proceed to chase boys and get embroiled in trouble. They even get their own suite at the hotel.

The reign of terror expands to include even more bratty kids, and I positively guarantee that you will scream for mercy when the girls engage in a very long rhetorical debate about having your cake and eating it too. A screenwriting variant is the debate about whether it's OK to sleep in a bed that's just been made (""you made your bed, now you have to sleep in it,"" in other words.) You will also be astounded by the (mercifully short) argument about whether Antares is the largest red giant star in the galaxy, or merely the second largest! See, it's like they're totally smart and all! When they were very young and on television, the Olsen girls pretty much just had to be adorable and that was it. It's a good thing too, because their natural acting abilities are bordering on nil, and what could have been merely annoying here becomes enormously grating by their very presence.

If you read the box, you know that ""amid the yachts, private jets, waverunners, scuba diving, motor scooters, horseback riding, and moonlit strolls, Mary-Kate and Ashley stumble across an antiquities smuggling ring,"" and sadly, this is all true. Not only do they highlight pretty much every activity you can do at the Atlantis Resort, they break into a yacht and discover illegal importing and exporting activities, they get arrested, go to jail, and their new boytoy Jordan gets framed. Of course they have to clear his name, donning their Columbo hats and becoming super-sleuths to discover the real smugglers. This basically means that they break into the yacht again and run around opening cabinets for what seems like hours. Good work, girls! (Groan.)

The tacked-on ending with the cast coming out of character is probably the most painful single element of the film (especially their screen mother's irate phone call to her agent about how she was upstaged by the girls.) In this segment there is a discussion of how Mary-Kate and Ashley produced and hired the writers on ""Holiday in the Sun,"" and boy does it ever show. The movie starts out as a glorified advertisement for the Atlantis, mixed with scenes showing that the girls are beautiful geniuses, but when the whole smuggling angle is introduced it devolves into a stupefying incomprehensible mess. You'll doubtlessly be pleased to know that at the end of the film they throw a dart at a map of the world to decide where their next vacation film will be. They show the dart hurling toward the map, and just before it hits the credits roll.

I don't know about you, but I'm hoping for Yemen.",1275696000,3,5126,4.778781038374718
1649385,1,B00005QJJ5,"I'm a male in his 20s who used to watch Olsen Twins movies back in the day because I had a huge crush on them.  I nonetheless tried to observe some semblance of plot and direction none of which this movie has got going for it.

Unless you're a teenage girl or a guy who loves looking at the Olsen twins, you will not be able to tolerate this movie.  I thought this movie was so terrible back in the day, I had to share my disgust about it years later.

First of all, there is nothing redeeming about it in 2009 other than the fact that it features European girl group Play, and Megan Fox (Transformers).  Even when it came out it was ridiculous for the Olsen twins.  There is no plot within the first hour of the movie.  ZERO plot.  What eventually turns into a movie is a very poor unimaginable story about one of their friends being involved in a some kind of illegal scheme.  It's that first hour of the movie that is God-awful terrible.  What you can expect in that first hour is random nonsense, the girls shopping, goofing around in a pool, whining and complaining about not getting what they want, and generally doing little too redeem Upper-class American teenager girls.

Do not, I reiterate, DO NOT waste your money purchasing this movie or waste valuable brain cells seeing it no matter who you are.",1231804800,,1310,4.394190871369295

The girls go the the Bahamas and there is adventure, romance, and just plain fun. Every since I've watched this I have wanted to go visit The Atlantis. The movie starts out with 2 girls and their parents doing vacation at the Bahamas. Of course they are heart broken because all their other friends got to go to Hawaii. They meet with the family friends and the adventure begins. The scrawny young friend they used to have is now a VERY cute, not so scrawny young man. There is also an employee at the resort that turns a couple of heads himself. They catch crooks, swim with dolphins, shop in some cool locations, and fall for the best guys, lol.

Between desperate Griffin trying to help clueless Scott get Madison to think he's ""smart"" and Jordan being Mr. Cool over Alex...what's the difference between Madison and Alex??? This movie truly stinks.

It's all MK and Ash having fluffy fun at an island resort, and then saving the US from Champlain.

The setting in the Bahamas is beautiful, and the script is fun. Mary-Kate and Ashley's characters are upset that they have to miss a trip to Hawaii with their class but wind up getting to go to the Bahamas with their family. They encounter a lot of interesting things. This is definitely one of their best movies, and I don't think it is just for little girls. Young adults would also like this movie, such as me.

Review:

Another fun and interesting Mary-Kate and Ashley movie for kids and teenagers.

For this age-group:

Good script that kept moving forward, interesting location, a subtle mystery that only our girls can solve, and some young adult entertainment in the fantastic Atlantis location.

Story:

Mary-Kate and Ashley travel with their parents to the Bahama's for a needed family vacation and get entwined with international artifact smuggling through a cute boy they hook up with; all while touring Nassau and the Atlantis Resort.",1116806400,2,535,5.385542168674699
1649402,5,B00005QJJ5,"I just watched this movie the s'morning! It is the best movie definetly if you love Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen as much as I do! They start off kinda upset that they don't get to go on their highschool winterbreak trip to hawaii. But after meeting the guyz of their dreams they forget all about the trip. They go through all kind of adventures through the whole  thing... From meeting hot guys to going on a cruise to going to jail. Its the best movie! Well I guess your going to have to watch it yourselfs. So GO GET IT!!! You won't be dissapointed.

This film is great for all mary-kate and ashley fans",1108339200,,331,3.955223880597015
1649414,3,B00005QJJ5,"This movie was too cheesy and sometimes left you with wondering how they went from this place to that...why they did what and all that stuff, just like all of the other Mary-Kate and Ashley movies. In this movie, there are two 15-year old girls: Madison (Mary-Kate) and Alex (Ashley). If you loved ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" then don't get this, because it's a lot more focused on love.
They just find out from their Dad that he's taking them to Atlantis resort, in The Bahamas--because of how hard they've been working in school. They're disappointed and whine a bunch about not going to Hawaii with their school peers--and having to live with their parents.
But...this movie is mostly about getting into deep relationships with boys. But that's a common Mary-Kate and Ashley movie. No morals or anything like that to it.
The MOST CONFUSING part was when the girls drove the yacht at the end to lure the police after them, so they would come on board and see the antiquities. Stupidly, they didn't know that they had to have it seen by them (and without ""exploring"" the boat) or they'd get arrested. It leaves me confused why they just didn't leave the yacht there while IT WAS PARKED and find the antiquities, and then turn it in then, telling the police where it was. That part made me feel like Mary-Kate and Ashley didn't have brains.
3/5 stars, because I'm generous, and also because it sometimes got confusing. But I LOVED their idea about going to the Bahamas for this movie, though. It's so pretty there. It's not a 1/5 star, because I was able to watch the whole thing.",1059523200,,1574,4.585106382978723
1649415,5,B00005QJJ5,"I am a 19 year old girl a big fan of Mary-kate and Ashley. I loved this movie. It shows how friends can have so much fun together. It is also sit in such a wonderful place. I was so taken by this movie and seeing how wonderful the hotal is for my sinor trip my parents took me to that hotal and it was even better then the movie showed.

Its obvious they are starting to get the hang of producing and casting and it definatley shows! Its a hell of a lot less cheesy than their previous attempts and definatley puts you in the mood for a holiday!
Oh, and what is so far fetched about a school trip to hawaii? And having their own suite, they are fifteen y'no, ive been having my own suite since then and have been to the Atlantis (gorgeous resort!) and feel this movie is an excellent portrayal of it!
Im also from the UK , and yes, some of us do live lives like this! I could fully relate to the twins characters and their lifestyle!",1052438400,,685,4.276923076923077
1649417,4,B00005QJJ5,"Holiday in the Sun is about Alex and Madison who are whisked away to the Bahamas for their winter break. They are staying at the awesome hotel, Atlantis, where they have fun in the sun and, of course, always find a boyfriend. A family friend, Griffen, likes Madison though she is going out with a dull surfer dude named Scott. Alex is pining for a relationship with a worker at Atlantis named Jordan, though she has to compete with a super-rich girl named Brianna Wallace.
This is one of MK+A's better films because of more talented actors and actresses and better plot line. The conflict in the story, though, (Being taken to jail for stealing antiquities and trying to prove Jordan innocent) is kind of corny.
I would reccomend this movie to any MK+A fan or any girl 6-12 or 13 years of age. The soundtrack for this movie is also really cool!",1049846400,3,844,4.522875816993464

They're only fifteen! Boys this, boys that. Too many of them! This movie is just a waste of your time and money. Unless you like to make out.",1047168000,2,457,3.9782608695652173

1649433,5,B00005QJJ5,"So we love this movie. So much. We watch it honestly, every weekend. It is soooooooooo stupid that it's hilarious and worthwhile. It's amazing how they are so overtly rich and living a life that any 15 year old girl dreams of.
Specifically, the best parts are the long conversations about ""having your cake and eating it too"" and ""you made your bed, and now you have to sleep in it"". They are painful to sit through and listen to, but entertaining nevertheless.
We must say though, that the girls have terrible tastes in guys. Jordan is horribly ugly and the way he talks induces vomit. Same with Sam in ""getting there"" (what 16 year old finds guys with curly mullets hot??? ew!) Scott (Billy Aaron Brown) however, is starting to get hot. We are kinda forcing ourselves to think he's hot.
Overall, see this movie if you have a good sense of humor and an open mind. They will never win an oscar, but the movies are just soooooooooo entertaining.",1041120000,,944,4.526315789473684

Its just aperance and they only look the way they do because they have people catering and fixing their hair/make-up/clothes etc. ALL the time. Now that the twins are teens all their movies have become the same plot basically. The twins get to go on a unbelivably nice vacation w/ basicaly no restrictions ( the run of the country pretty much) and then they find boys.. fall in love, chase them around the city,kiss,and sometimes there is even a ""bad person"" to intervine!! oh dear.. talk about origional! This is SO old. Its the typical girl meets boy plot and thats not even really a plot! All these ""teen movies"" of theirs are the same and are all awful!

Believe it or not,both twins are sitting in class imagining that they would like to take a summer trip when suddenly their parents ring up the school to tell them they are all taking a summer trip. What follows is beautiful people,beautiful beaches,and beautiful smiles. Viewers are actually supposed to hate Breanna,a dark cloud in a perfect little land,but people will actually be relieved that she's there to put a little dent in the twins smiley summer.

Then there's the fact that there are no comparisons in either twins personality other than their hairstyles. It was no use even trying to  tell which one was Alex and which one was Madison. When one of the twins' boyfriends is sent away to clean up puke,I should have realized that it was a trick. After all,nobody (throws-up)in Heaven,especially not when it is inhabited by two identical angels who smile too much. Watch the film,you'll know what I mean. Actually,check that,DON't watch the film. To be fair,it really wasn't completely painful. Really, more like ripping off a bandaid then having a needle. It was Ok to sit through if you don't mind that the director is an embarassment. Can you believe Mary and Ashley actually CHOSE this dude!!?It isn't their fault,they know no better,they were in Full House,if I recall.",1039478400,,1614,4.8267148014440435
1649436,5,B00005QJJ5,"I like this movie. Its actually probably my favorite Mary Kate and Ashley movie.
The story can be a bit weak in parts, but is still entertaining. For example, they seem to be very rich (private plane, and complain aobut going to the Bahamas instead of Hawaii) and in the movie seem to do a lot of things which ordinary people could never do: like never waiting in lines at the water slides and other little things.
One thing I love though, is that the outfits in this movie are great. They have different swimsuits in every swimming scene, and they are all very cool. The only outift in the whole movie that I don't like, is one shirt in the last scene that says He Loves Me on the back with a bow on the front.
Anyways, overall the movie was good. I think their should have been more leading up to the whole antique smuggling thing though, because its kind of like 'umm where did that come from?'. But I do recommend it for girls ages 9-15.",1038787200,,941,4.262569832402234

I'm sure any young teen or anyone whoes like 7-15 would like it, even some older like my sister whoes 17 likes them...ha. Can't say the same about their new movie, ""Getting There"", unfortunatly.

The only good part of this movie would probably have to be the last 20 min. of it. The only thing that this movie made me think was how I wished that I could have private plane, or how they sit in the sun with a beautiful view of the The Bahamas, or party, or having cute boys after you. this movie was probably the worst of MKA. It was so not realistic. Our lips are sealed and winning london were so much better. All of Mary-kate & ashley movie are about two little rich girls having so much money and going on vacation and finding two boys that automatically like them. Nothing is that realistic. MKA are okay but have got to know that nobody likes to see a movie about two girls that richer and look better than ever single time MKA have a new movie out.

...it's not an oscar worthy movie, but i wouldn't say it was terrible. if you're 16 or below, invite over some friends, make popcorn, and enjoy this movie for it's entertainment - not its plot. it's fun - especially in the summer. i wouldn't buy it - but it's definitley worth it... to rent.
one more thing to parents - it's basically an advertisment for the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas, so when kids ask ""Can we go there"" you'll know why :)

At first I was worried that I might be getting too old for Mary-Kate and Ashley, (I am 14) but just re-watching another of their movies such as Our Lips are Sealed told me that this was not it.  I think this movie just wasn't quite up to their standards!  If you want to get this movie, I would advise you to rent it first so you can get an initial reaction to it.  If you still love it - that's totally fine: go out an buy it.  This is just my opinion.

1649468,1,B00005QJJ5,"I'll admit that I'm a sucker for corny movies. I thought the past MK&A movies did a good job at filling in this need (I'm 15, in case this helps). This movie, however, was absolutely horrendous.
First of all, there is no plot that you'd actually care about. The movie is all about two extroardinarily ditzy girls spending their winter break in the Bahamas. With their past movies, the twins had an interesting way of ending up in a different country, but with this movie, it's just two rich girls, Alex and Madison, getting whisked off in their private jet and moping about the fact that they couldn't go to Hawaii instead (wow, what humbleness). Seriously, the only two plots to the movie that I remember are a tug-of-war between a guy that two girls want, and a situation in which Alex and Madison had to get their friend out of jail (this entire sequence was extremely pitiful and juvenile). Everything else in the movie involves the twins ""having fun"" (playing around in a pool, shopping, getting grossed out by slaughtered fish, and boring, mindless stuff that can get very tiresome after a mere 30 seconds). I realize this is a movie for young girls, but even so, there are SO many better kids' movies out there that choosing this one would be pathetic. MK&A's past movies, specifically ~Our Lips are Sealed~ and ~Winning London~, are much better. Either that or go buy another Disney movie. I don't see how MK&A are even being good role models for little girls, as all they do is promote a superifical girlyness to the extreme. Don't waste your money on a film about .., stylish accessories, and anything that doesn't involve brainpower.",1024012800,7,1644,4.692041522491349

The first time I watched it I thought it was lame, but after a while I learned to love it!  It's a really girly movie, beaches, tanning, boys, beautiful sunsets, lavish hotels, smoothies (lol), swimming, shopping, the cute outfits, omg it was just really exciting.

I've been to four of the places where Mary-Kate and Ashley film their movies, and this one had the best scenery! I went to Atlantis and it was as beautiful as it was on the movie! The plot was great and their clothes were awesome! But, there were two things that bothered me- they got to ride in a limo and they flew in a private jet- what does their dad do to get sooooo much money?? They even had their own suite in the Atlantis hotel- that was a little ridiculous. But, it was great otherwise. It was very interesting and the characters were great!

1649481,3,B00005QJJ5,"This movie is all right; it has rockin' music and some pretty good scenes. But when compared to Passport To Paris, Our Lips Are Sealed and Winning London, this one is a bit shallow.
Holiday In The Sun is the fourth in a series that is obiously growing with haste. It reflects this in the ending and by repeating the same girl meets boy thing from the previously mentioned films. It's just new names, some new faces in a new setting with very clueless parents. It's all becoming a little old and predictable.
But don't get me wrong, I think any of the recent Mary-Kate & Ashley films are good. I give them credit for remaining clean in the language and conduct department. Their films are a good choice if you're looking for a movie to share with kids in their eary teens. Especially if you value some decency in what you watch, Holiday In The Sun follows that trend. Allthough it is not quite as good as the three previous travel films. And I would likely suggest Our Lips Are Sealed or Winning London before this one.",1022889600,,1018,4.420212765957447

While I did enjoy ""Holiday In The Sun"" my main comment is that it made me feel bad about myself. Not to good for a movie which is meant for girls.  It just made me wonder, ""why don't I have a private airplane, why don't I get to go to resorts, why do I have a limo, or a private suite, or tons of boys after me..."" I even wanted a twin at that moment!  Well anyways...while Im not completely dissing the movie, I would have enjoyed it a lot better if the girls were depicted more realistically.

Of course the girls hook up with boys but along with a twist to who the girls end up with their is a crime in the movie.  The girls must work together to prove their friend innocent and keep him out from behind bars.  Also the music to this movie is wonderful!  The songs fit perfectly with the plot.

It was more like real life.  It wasn't like their other movies where they would stop and give a little side note to the audience, which I thought was completely stupid.  They are more grown up too...which is part of the reason I liked it.  Well, those are my thoughts on the movie.  Hope you enjoy it!",1021852800,,589,4.2342342342342345

The movie had no action at all until about a half an hour left in it. It was absolutely terrible. Mary Kate and Ashley usually turn out at least decent movies, but this one was truly the worst I've ever seen. It basically looked like the girls decided they wanted to go to the Bahamas and have the camera crew film them while they had fun. There was hardly any acting and what there was of it wasn't all that great. The ""parents"" part was definitely way too corny.

I think that they kind of went overboard with the whole getting in trouble part which i think is a bad influance on kids. And their parents didn't even get that mad at them when they went past their curfew. There was no plot what so ever only about another girl trying to steal a guy away from one of the twins. And them finding illeagel goods. The scenery was beautiful but everything was just too perfect and that isn't what a real vacation is like. And they kept getting the perfect guys so it kinda was soo predictable and one of the twins was having a horrible time with a guy and another  was having a great time and that was unrealistic.,1021766400,,749,4.165517241379311

Although it seemed to be one big Atlantis ad, I really thought that added to what I liked about it.  When I watched it, I was on winter break and it made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside and it made me look forward to summer.  The soundtrack was pretty good too, except it's a little too much ""girl-power"" kind of songs.  And personally, I thought it was kind of inspiring because it kind of makes you want to be able to wear their cute outfits and bathing suits.  I think the thing I didn't like the most was how the ""hottest guy in the place"" as Brianna said was Jordan.  And personally, I thought he was like the ugliest guy and I loved how when they did a close-up on him, his pimples like shined in the light haha.

First, they get whisked off to the Bahamas in a private jet and then they're mad about it because they miss their school trip to Hawaii (poor them!) They have to make the ""best out of the situation"". Personally, if I had problems like that, I would be... them! Anyway, they get the cutest guys on the beach, their parents are 20 years too young and totally aloof from their surroundings, and not to mention that they're in one of the greatest resorts on the entire planet (with their own suite)?!

The clothes were cool, the scenery was beautiful, I could watch it over and over again!!  Its really good to watch when its cold and rainy outside.  You can escape to the bahamas without leaving your home.  Its a good buy!",1010275200,,391,4.514285714285714

It's like unrealistic. I also thought that the movie was like a big commercial for atlantis in the bahamas! well anyways it was a good movie and i recomend it to everyone!",1010275200,,366,4.477611940298507
1649515,1,B00005QJJ5,"My 7 year old daughter preferred Winning London, Our Lips Are Sealed, and Passport to Paris, to this thinly veiled advertisement for the Atlantis Hotel.
Holiday in the Sun has no plot from the beginning. It was like watching the Olsen sister's home video of their most recent vacation. Did you ever have to sit through someone else's home movies or slides of their vacation/trip? This movie was just like that. BORING! The antique smuggling part of the adventure was only actively thrown in for just the last 15 minutes of the movie.
Overall, this movie was disappointing. Buy one of the other afforementioned titles, they're better.",1009929600,3,633,4.925233644859813
1649516,3,B00005QJJ5,"This movie had cute moments, pretty clothes, etc. etc but not a point. It's about the same thing as ""Passport to Paris"". Simialer things: Girls are really popular, get the boys, boys ALWAYS like them, bummed abou their vacation, etc., etc. I did like the singing group, ""Play: Us against the World"" the songs were pretty good and so i bought the cd of it.

Being thirteen years old, I enjoyed how the Olsen twins movies have grown along with them, and I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of ten.  There are multiple kissing scenes in this video and with it's grown-up additude, I assume that younger childern wouldn't be able to sit still for the hour and one half long movie.  The music though is very cool and I enjoyed the new group ""Play"" from Sweeden.  The group consists of twelve and fourteen year old girls who sing songs to their age level.  I was very amazed at how the Olsen twins movies have grown along with them, and I am very proud to say that they are doing a wonderful acting job.

I bought this movie cause I'm a MKA Fan. But this movie ist AWFUL! I can't belive Mary-Kate and Ashley made such a ""bad"" movie. Where's the plot? Is there one? I didn't find it!
It seems Dualstar wanted to make an extra-cheap movie :-(",1008979200,3,253,4.291666666666667
1649519,3,B00005QJJ5,"I just finished watching this new video by the girls, and it was SOMEWHAT enjoyable. I reccommend this video for all ages about 12-17. The storyline has changed from their previous movies making it a little more for older audiences, however, they're not little Michelle anymore.
My only complaint with this film is that the camera effects just did not cut it. The camera gets way too close to the subject and shakes too much, making the viewers almost sick sitting for 90 minutes watching the video. I am not sure if they think it's ""cool,"" but it sure makes it hard to keep your eyes focused.
Overall, a great movie.",1008374400,,617,4.5675675675675675
1649520,2,B00005QJJ5,"Its better than some of their movies. This is more for teens but is not that good. I thought it was kind of boring. They play Alex and Madison and they take a family vacation to the Bahamas. Although Alex and Madison are dissapointed because they would rather take a vacation with their friends, and not another boring family vacation. Its to much like their older movies that they did in the past. Do something DIFFERENT! They meet cute boys and become friends just like in Our Lips Are Sealed and Winning London.",1008374400,,514,4.537634408602151

Full of sun and fun and the worlds cutest girls, if you expect Hepburn and Tracy you will be dissapointed,the film is light and upbeat even in the scary parts and thier acting has developed although, you may not notice because they've always played themselves. Yes, shameless product placement abounds but if they flipped the bill for my production I would advertise for them! it's the American way.
If you can pretend you're 14 again or you are or a MKA fan you will enjoy this movie as much as any of the other MKA flicks.",1008028800,,637,4.316666666666666

I am the same age as them so I have every one of thier videos and I thought this one topped Winning London. They are so pretty in this one (like they are in every movie) and the place they stayed at was AMAZING (...)Anyways if you haven't seen this one GO out and rent it because it is incredible.(...),1007769600,,394,3.9375
1649523,1,B00005QJJ5,"After great master pieces of Winning London and Our lips are sealed, Mary-Kate and Ashley finally managed to make Passport to Paris no longer my least favorite Olsen movie. Some professional reviewers claimed that Holiday in the sun is a commercial for the Atlantis hotel... they are so 100% right! The DVD even starts with a commercial for Atlantis! Even before the Warner Bros logo pops up! How low can you go? I thought commercials were always a taboo for movie actors... either I am wrong with that thought, or the twins really need to do some major changes.
There is absolutely nothing interesting in the plot and events, for so far any are happening, are short and shockey. The camera effects make it look as if the whole movie was just ripped of MTV. The whole movie is entirely inconsistent.
Their dad for example is so young, that he can never be their dad, unless their mom did something very illegal. Keeping in that line, the guys Mary-Kate and Ashley date in the movie are also quite old for them.
The end of the movie was highly ironical. It gave a sort of behind the scenes look. All actors dropped out of character and the director and such came on screen. It wasn't really the movie for it though. If they did it in Our lips are sealed, it would have been fun, as in that movie the characters ""know"" that they are ""in a movie"". In Holiday in the sun, it was just so out of place.
The ironic part is that the twins kinda confirm everything what they should improve. I hope they do so because they finally realize that they are going the wrong way.
First of all there is the actress who plays mom. She calls her agent upset, claiming that the movie is just 100% Mary-Kate and Ashley, and that upsets here. Well, she isn't the only one, as this movie has just an enormous ""Look at me, I'm a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie""-factor.
Then there is Mary-Kate and Ashley, who are also producers of the movie. They joke on firing the director... not a bad idea girls. Perhaps firing the entire crew wouldn't be such a bad idea.
The ending is the worst part though. The twins throw a dart at the world map for the location of their next movie. On the moment they did that, I lost a lot of faith in their credibility. What's wrong with a movie in the USA? Not that I mind those distant movies, but it makes just seem that they are only making movies because they like to travel. With their cash they can just go any where they like. Why should their holidays be supported by their fans? That is just what Holiday in the sun actually is, a holiday in the sun. And just as with Passport to Paris, they want to make money out of their movie.
They also marked the places of the movies they made before. London, Paris, Sydney, the Bahamas so girls, you forgot the North American locations? Venice (Billboard Dad), New York city (It takes two), Toronto (Switching goals)? And how about the Olsen movies when they were still made for quality instead of money? Like How the west was fun and To grandmother's house we go?
I just recommend that fans of the twins who want to stay fans do not watch this movie. Their ""fan-factor"" will plummet down massively, mine did. The twins seemed to have committed show-bizz suicide with the release of the movie.",1007769600,,3243,4.415692821368948
