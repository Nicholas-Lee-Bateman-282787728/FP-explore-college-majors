6416855,5,B00KD64ID6,"I wasn't sure what I was going to get when I first started watching this film, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  It am not going to give any spoilers, suffice it to say that it is artfully done, well acted and beautifully directed. There are a few scenes that  cause you to tilt you head to one side in doggy fashion, but I think a re-watch will probably tell you what various symbolisms mean. IMHO, I think this was cynical  take on love and naivet. In spite of that negative nelly outlook, I enjoyed it immensely. Dark, fascinating, sexy and satisfying, It is a definite recommend for anyone looking for a little something beyond typical horror gore.",1412121600,8,662,4.5
6416856,3,B00KD64ID6,"The film opens with a weird monologue about how the door to evil opens every 66 moon cycles and is allowed for 66 moments(?). And I am not sure how that fit into the film but apparently it does with a girls' birthday falling on 06-06.

Toby McClift (Peter Gadiot) grows up under the careful teachings of his father, a preacher who teaches Toby that ""Killing evil is doing good"" and that he must not love...ever. Meanwhile Toby believes that cowards miss out of life and of love as he has a rendezvous with Katy (Jytte-Merle Bhrnsen) in a cemetery. Things go horribly amiss as Toby sees a demon cart off his girl.

6 years later (about 66 lunar months?)  Toby is released from a mental institution and takes a tutoring job at the Wallace manor and instructs a young girl Laura who looks just like Katy. There is also Lady Wallace (Jeanette Hain) who lives in the house with her consort Mortimer (Klaus Tange) who is the epitome of evil. Toby ""knows"" Laura must be Katy and wants to escape with her, but the odd events going on in the house as well as his weird dreams hinder his plans. Also Laura likes to play games.

The film would have made more sense if it was a simple witchcraft story and they left out the 66 lunar stuff and some aspect of Christianity never fully utilized.  There are abstract scenes that are artistic dreams which caused me to scratch my head as Toby is also on meds. It is a film I would of enjoyed better if I wasn't trying to figure out what was going on.

This is more of a supernatural thriller/drama than a horror film.

I like cheesy horror films but this one reaches a new low.

Melodrama is too tame a description for, well, every thing about this affair.  The special effects were cartoonish CGI, but that only added to the entertaining bizzarity of the movie.  The shooting location was the one seriously remarkable part of The Forbidden Girl.  It has been years since I sat through a film so terrible, yet so enjoyable.",1451606400,2,520,4.886363636363637
6416920,2,B00KD64ID6,"The Forbidden Girl is a German film with intriguing cinematography. The creepy old mansion, the beautifully detailed rooms, the carefully selected props, the lush costumes; all make for a film with some great horror genre ambience. Unfortunately, however, great films require intriguing storylines that get their hooks in you and don't let go.  That's where this film falls apart.
I watched the entire movie and kept thinking that it would have made a beautiful music video for a Nine Inch Nails song,  if condensed to four minutes. It just doesn't work as a feature film!  If, like me, you're attracted to Gothic Horror, just set the film on mute and use it as a backdrop while you play some great classical, opera, or sinister rock music.  And don't forget the absinthe!",1451433600,,772,4.870229007633588
6416921,4,B00KD64ID6,"Strange and twisted paranormal story of a young man destined to play a part in a centuries old dynasty involving the curse and blessing of immortality. Truthfully the tale had me confused at times, but entranced enough to continue watching. The acting is not bad, if at times the script is vague and unclear. They tell you just enough of the story so you think you know what is going, but always remain slightly uncertain. To give you my two pence, I took the couple seeking immortality as sorcerers after a fashion, seeking to use the young couple as their unwitting pawns in the consummation (literal and figurative) of a diabolic ritual to grant them continued immortality. I'm assuming the young woman was periodically possessed by the elder sorceress to fit her ends. Somewhere, true love had to fit in, as the young man had to actually love the young girl for the ritual to work. Look for no happy endings however, as the young man ends up as a spiritual prisoner, the girl disappears (?) and the evil sorcerers get away with their plan and their renewed youth. However, there hang enough loose ends and unfinished pieces of the puzzle that other interpretations are entirely possible. The effects are by and large well done, though not high budget. At times the action slips into the slightly comedic, but aims more for horrific melodrama than actual comedy, and by and large achieves it. Grant you this is not the height of supernatural horror cinema; but it's pleasant enough to call it an overlooked gem. It also has a bit of the Lovecraftian gothic about it, which I love and look for in films.",1451174400,,1605,4.6749116607773855

I was intrigued by the uniqueness of the movie, which was a blend of an enchanted fairy-tale, love story and a satanic, would-be horror movie. It doesn't  seem to know what it wants to be; therefore, while interesting, it is also confusing. I was able to determine most of the plot, although the movie had holes akin to Swiss cheese.

I suppose one could say that the movie isn't saying that this is how all Christians are, just that this one guy is insane.

I think half of the reviews are from people who didn't finish the film or are pretty stupid. Ok the film has some great sets and other than the very beginning is acted ok. Lighting is great. Like many indi film makers the movie was made overly complicated and then does t spell everything out, confusing the hell out of people. Here is the synopsis: basically this guy is someone who can take down evil if  he can withstand temptation. Why is never explained even to him other than he has the mark. These creatures who I'd describe as vampires (but they aren't quite vampires exactly) want to sacrifice him so the chick can regain her youth. She has been doing this for centuries and dude meets another guy who was sacrificed and us a ghost there ( you don't know this till the end). Yes the two chicks are the same, she can make herself look like whatever...it's pretty obvious. Her man starts yo get a bit jealous and almost ruins it all because apparently she would like to jump young dudes bones. In the end he make the wrong decision (although you don't understand why at that point)  Now does everyone get it? Also the whole weird 66  moon cycles have to do with exactly when the sacrifice must take place. Ok movie to have on while you do other things.

6417106,5,B00KD64ID6,"It hurts me to see this film having such low ratings on Amazon, but after watching it about five times I think I can understand why, and I want to try to fix things by helping this film get the intelligent, open minded cult audience it deserves.

First, you have to know that this is a hybrid of art house and horror, which is a hard thing to be in today's world unless your director is named either David Lynch or David Cronenberg. Now I love both Davids because each of them is able to create an entire, satisfying reality in each film they make, a reality in which time and memory and perception and truth all follow different rules than the ones we're accustomed to in normal life. Both David L and David C have succeeded at this again and again, have built up solid followings, and have legitimized a lot of far out ideas and techniques, enriching mainstream cinema in the process, and because of that they get a lot of respect, and when people compare a movie to Lynch or Cronenberg then there are automatically some people out there who say ""Oh, well I should check that out.""

The thing is, there are a lot of movies out there, such as this one, that achieve the same miracle, but making stylistic choices that are completely foreign to the Lynch and Cronenberg universes, and it's a lot harder to talk about these moviesbut it's fun for people like me, because it gives me a chance to play tour guide and show you around the beautiful worlds I've discovered. So let's start here.

There are so many hidden gems in this movie, so many pay offs for the viewer who's able to pay attention that it's reminiscent of the Zen koan that goes: ""This koan is a mirror. If a monkey looks in, no sage will look out."" In order to understand this movie, you have to pay more attention than you would for most films, and you have to learn how to pay different kinds of attention.

I'm really multi-tasking here, because I want both to defend the film and also explain it to you. It's a lot like the task Joseph Campbell faced when he set out to write about  James Joyce's novel Finnegans' Wake, arguably the most challenging book in all of literature anywhere ever. The book that Campbell wrote was called A Skeleton's Key to Finnegans' Wake and it's helped immensely to make Joyce's masterpiece accessible to, you know, people like me who are nowhere near as erudite as Campbell.

Campbell started off strong by devoting several pages to the first four PARAGRAPHS of Joyce's work, which to the uninformed eye appear indecipherable but with Campbell's elucidation prove to be a treasure chest of poetic ideas that essentially give present all the major poetic ideas at the core of the novel.

Similarly, the first fifteen minutes or so of Forbidden Girl are deliberately disorienting, so much so that people really can be forgiven for tuning out by the time that the movie begins to his its stride. For the remainder of this review, I'm going to address this crucial first section of the film. I'll probably throw in some minor spoilers, so proceed with caution...

After a credit sequence filled with images of distorted light and titles that appear and disappear, we are given the image of a bright, round light shining against a dark backgroundit is the sun suspended not in our sky, but out in space, a body of pure light surrounded by pure darkness, which tells you this is a movie about duality, light vs. dark, good vs. evil. And at the same time, we hear a man's voice talking about how every 66 cycles of the moon a portal opens to eternity and dark forces are able, like the biblical Lazarus, to travel out of the inferno and into the world of the living. This gives the movie its context in the pantheon of horror sub-genresit's a story, like The Omen franchise, The Prophecy, Crowley, Grace, even the Exorcist, a story in which there is a tenuous barrier between this world and a much darker one, and evil forces on both sides of that barrier trying to break it down. Moreover, we are tipped off how this barrier is to be broken down: something or someone evil will mate ""in true love."" So this is going to be a movie about sex and seduction, andconsidering the word ""forbidden"" is in the titleprobably on some level a retelling of the story of the Garden of Eden and the ""Fall of Man"".

The sun is replaced by an auditorium in a derelict building. The ornate rosette windows indicate at some point the building was a church, but the peeling WWII-Era murals on the wall on either side of the stage indicate that at some point the church declined, was abandoned, reconverted into something secular, and then abandoned yet again.

Onstage is a preacher, dressed in black with a white dog collar. Behind him is a chalkboard filled with mathematical equations, abstract but scientific looking graphs and diagrams. The preacher has a congregation of exactly one person, dressed like a prison inmate, genuflected before some sort of prayer stool (you can tell I was raised agnostic because if I'd been to church as a child I'd probably know what that kind of stool is called).

It's pretty clear that the preacher, whoever he is, is mad. He tells the young man (his son, it turns out later, and the movie's protagonist/anti-hero, All American Boy Toby McClift) ""you are chose, you are marked with a sign, you are FORBIDDEN (emphasis mine)  to love until the day you die."" He thumps on his bible, chants with all the fanatic zeal of a Nazi at a Nuremberg rally, over and over in a hypnotic rhythm: ""Killing evil is doing good.""  and young Toby McClift chants along, indicating that at least on some level, he is being brainwashed.

We the audience are given about two seconds to digest this before the film cuts to a title screen that reads ""six hours later."" It is blue-filtered nighttime, and Toby McClift is climbing over a stone wall handcuffs dangling from one risk. He has, we will later learn, just escaped from being shackled to the bed by his father. McClift pauses to check his phone: he has received a text. ""06.06.2006: Must CU B4 sunrise. Old graveyard @midnight. Something you'll never 4get awaits you. Follow the signs: UR 4-bidden girl.""

Take a moment and read that written another way: ""6/6/6: Must see you before sunrise. Old graveyard at midnight. Something you'll never forget awaits you. Follow the signs: your forbidden girl."" If you can appreciate the way that two voicesone girlish and playful, the other sinister and shaded with dark undertones of the occultyou'll go a long way toward understanding the sort of intelligence and subtlety that went into making this film. It's a genius for ambiguity. Ambiguity is everything herethat's why the movie's start is so scrambled and disorienting, because you're supposed to be guessing all the way through: ""What is real and what is not real? Who can Toby McClift trust?"" And most importantly, who is the 4-bidden girl?

Next we see McClift weaving his way through a labyrinthine cemetery, guided by a strand of yarn. Those hip to Greek mythology will immediately know that this is an image lifted from the myth of Theseus, who with the help of the beautiful and brilliant Ariadne used a skein of yarn to mark his path through a dark labyrinth. Such a yarn trail came to be known as a clew, and is the origin of our English word ""clue.""

They will also remember that inside the Labyrinth Theseus encountered a murderous, half-human monster called the Minotaur.

 McClift's clew/clue leads him into a crypt where we meet our Ariadne, our Eve, our heroine or perhaps our villain, the 4-bidden girl herself, whom McClift calls only ""Katie.""

She is played by Jytte-Merle B&ouml;hnsen, who for my money is an exceptionally talented and beautiful actress. One might be forgiven for thinking she's a poor actor because her accent keeps changing, but if you look watch closely and think about it you'll recognize that what she's actually doing is acting out precisely the same duality of voices that I pointed out in the text message above.

This is a perfect moment, too, to defend the acting talent Peter Gadiot, who plays Toby McClift. Toby is never meant to be the sharpest knife in the drawer, and Peter Gadiot is so good at playing the character that it's easy to convince yourself that the actor playing him is just some Keanu Reeves type with good looks, mediocre talent, and no capability for nuance and subtlety. Look closer, friends. Observe how many times in the crypt scene Toby imitates, that is speaks in, his father's voice. It indicates that McClift is all at once making fun of his fanatic, loveless father, but that he has also internalized his father to a degree that may be extremely detrimental to him.

Just like the first scene in the derelict auditorium, the crypt scene feels truncated, cut short. Katie makes it clear that she's very eager to get a lot more intimate with Toby McClift (perhaps to mate with him ""in true love""). Toby McClift tells her about his strained relationship with his father, and to illustrate he bares his chest, showing the birthmark that his father believe to be the sign of the chosen one. Then McClift asks what it is he has to see before sunrise, and Katie bears HER chest, a generous amount of bare chest revealed with one slow, smooth downward tug on the zipper of her hoodie, a tug so slow that it's only halfway down that we realize what Katie is going to show McClift is NOT her bare breasts but rather a golden amulet.

Then the screen goes black. We hear sounds of a struggle, and Katie is screaming for her life, and then silence. Then all of a sudden, a pale skinned demon of some kind is lunging at the screen, behind him a cloud of black smoke moving in ways smoke is not supposed to moveand another title: ""Six weeks later.""

Clearly, we have missed something.

A male police officer and a female psychiatrist (presumably) are walking through the cemetery. In a convoluted and slang filled way, he fills us in on what we've missed: six weeks ago there was some sort of struggle in the cemetery. Toby McClift was found in the crypt with his father's severed head. According to Tony, what happened is that all of a sudden his rendezvous with Katie was interrupted by his father, who attempted to kill Katie by dousing her with kerosine and setting her on fire. But all of a sudden, Toby claims, some sort of monster (presumably the demon we just witnessed) interrupted the father's attack, killed the father and then abducted Katie, who is still missing six weeks later. If she even existed. The officer has his doubts. It's clear that he suspects Toby of possibly murdering his own father and possibly having a hand in Katie's disappearance, or simply of making her up, as there is no trace of her and nobody even knows her last name.

What feels odd about this scene is that it seems such a flagrant violation of the adage Show Don't Tell. Why on earth did the filmmakers choose not to show this action-packed sequence, but rather to have it clumsily described by a third party who wasn't even present at the scene. Actually, we DO get a chance to see the ""missing"" scene a few minutes later in a flashback. Again, the key concept here is ambiguity. By the time we see the scene in Toby's mind, we are already questioning his sanity, and questioning whether he is a victim or a murderer or some combination of the two.

The policeman and psychologist penetrate the crypt and find Toby crumpled in a ball on the floor, a wreck, on the forbidden side of the crime scene tape. He is taken away.

And yet again the scene is truncated, cut off before any resolution. We see an imposing castle, and  (we haven't visited there yet, but it will be the setting for pretty much all of the rest of the film) is outlined against a dark blue sky, and the words ""The Forbidden Girl"" materialize in front of it.

Then we get another title card screenthe last one, it turns outtelling us that now six YEARS have passed. Keep in mind that this is about nine minutes into the film, and we still have not had a scene that has played itself out in any sort of linear, accessible fashion. Hopefully what I've written up until now will at least make it plausible to you that the confusion here has been DELIBERATELY SET UP by writerdirector Tim Hastreiter.

Fortunately for all of us, at this point the film takes a turn and becomes about 400% more straightforward and accessible. We find out that Toby has spent six years in an institution (named, it turns out, after Lazarus), and is just now being dischargedby one Dr Batigce, who, with his casual airs and his unbuttoned shirt, has mannerisms more in line with a stereotypical mafia-movie goodfella than he does with a stereotypical movie psychiatrist, and considering the stack of nightmarish paintings by Toby that he's leafing through as he speaks and Toby's drawn and haggard appearance across the desk the viewer has lots of reasons to think the good doctor may not be acting in anyone's best interest. But he does manage to find a job offering for a live-in tutoring position. In a spooky castle, wherein all sorts of spooky things will happen.

But I've said enough. I've used my skeleton key to open a door for you, and given you a clew to follow. I hope it will give you the patience and guidance you navigate the complex but rewarding labyrinth of a movie.",1416528000,3,13329,4.606239460370995

8657794,1,B00KD64ID6,"Here is my best interpretation of this movie:
This is a story with 5 essential characters: 2 vampires, a crazy man, a good samaritan ghost and a demonic doctor.

The two vampires want to be able to go out in the sun and/or become human (???)
The male vamp is an Arnold wannabe type, the female vamp has a split personality and it seems it is also split between two bodies(???)  These vamps believe they can achieve their goal by causing a crazy man to show his love for one of the female vamp's personalities.

The crazy man is not really the main character, but the one with the most face time.
The ghost is just trying to help, but like most ghosts, no body pays attention to them.
One gets the impression that the demonic doctor was part of the two vamps' plan all along, but who really knows.??? Did he die, what's up with his eyes?
