2712664,1,B000LPS2PY,"I was very disappointed.  While I am a fan of Ryan Dunn there wasn't enough of him in the dvd to really make it worthwhile and Don Vito's drunken antics were repulsive.

It seemed as though they were trying for a return to the ""good"" old days of the Steve-O DTTAH tours, but without Steve-O.  Despite the description of the dvd, he isn't in this film whatsoever, although his old cohorts of Nick Dunlap and Carolla are.

Bad.  Just.....bad.",1199232000,10,440,4.518987341772152
2712665,4,B000LPS2PY,"I find Dunn as funny as the rest of the cky/jackass gang. But this dvd does turn into the Vito show at certain points. The dvd itself is very funny, and is a worthy purchase to your cky/jackass collection. I wish it would have been longer, but that is a small issue. Perhaps Dunn will put out his own dvd in the future.",1194048000,,319,4.079365079365079
8163529,5,B000LPS2PY,Packaging was secure. Disc looked as if it had zero spin time. Perfect.,1436659200,,71,4.538461538461538
8163530,5,B000LPS2PY,"Funny as hell. Doesn't go for long enough in my opinion, I wished it kept going. If you're a Jackass/CKY/Bam fan, make sure you get this for your collection, it won't be available forever. RIP Dunn.",1412467200,,198,4.527777777777778
8163531,4,B000LPS2PY,"I buy most stuff Jackass related. Sadly Dunn is RIP, but him and Vito always make stuff funny. This is a decent rock tour dvd. There could be a little more music on it but it's neat to see the behind the scenes stuff going on!",1398124800,,226,3.9347826086956523
8163532,3,B000LPS2PY,"The scenes with Don Vito in this movie are hilarious and Ryan Dunn was a lot of fun to watch and Brandon Dicamillo as the narrator was perfect but the rest of the film was very bland and not very interesting. I would only recommend this movie to Don Vito fans, Ryan Dunn fans, or even Brandon Dicamillo fans but if you don't like any of them I recommend you skip this title.",1353456000,,374,4.136986301369863
8163533,3,B000LPS2PY,I love anything jackass and this is just the same as anything these guys do it is a pretty funny movie and x rated. I just don't know why all these pretty girls would do Vito absolutely disgusting.,1329177600,,197,4.2105263157894735
8163534,5,B000LPS2PY,"i thought, in my opinion, this was funny as hell. but, only, because i am a Don Vito fan. if you're not, you won't like it. sure it isn't long, but it was long enough.",1315008000,,167,3.8
8163535,4,B000LPS2PY,"i would understand why a number of people would find this DVD dull,
its not extremely entertaining and on occasion in the format of an average documentary.

however after following the cky crew my whole life i did still enjoy the simple antics of Dunn, Vito, and Dico.

i would recommend the original CKY videos to start off with to those whom are not current followers of the crew, and build up to have enough familiarity to enjoy this just for the sheer following.

i did enjoy this video.",1309737600,2,491,4.49438202247191
8163536,4,B000LPS2PY,Not the best I've seen from the group but not the worse. If you can get it for $10 or less I think it's worth it.,1291939200,,113,3.3846153846153846
8163537,4,B000LPS2PY,"Overall, it was a good video, its a lot like the Steve-O videos ""Dont try this home""  but they all have the same crew filming them (Nick Dunlap, Etc.)  Great scenes of Don Vito going nuts for some Budweiser Select. definately reccommended for a fan of the Jackass guys.",1205798400,,269,4.469387755102041
8163538,5,B000LPS2PY,"I was a little scared when I purchased this because the other two reviews were not so good.  I am a big fan of these guys and I really like what they do and they are very funny.  So it is not really a rock tour at all.  All it is them going to places to perform women licking don vitos toes and having sex with really hot women.  There were two bands that toured with them, Open hand and Fight Paris and they are really great bands.  Those are the only bands that they tour with and they perform as well as the other guys.  It is a lot of fun just because it is just ridiculous how these guys act but it is funny.  A couple get arrested and such for stupid reasons but what can I say.  Then there is just a lot of drinking and parting.  It is just a fun watch but not really worth paying money for unless you are a big fan of these guys.  It isn't like jackass or viva la bam at all, it is its own thing and I really liked it.  It is only like an hour long and there are bonus features and in that there are two music videos by the guys that they were with and some other stuff.",1200960000,2,1078,3.789237668161435
