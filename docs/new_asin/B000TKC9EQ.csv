8608408,5,B000TKC9EQ,"It seems that the DVD is converted from VHS video. This is a great dvd for beginners, especially for people who have no sailing or very limited sailing experiences. The basic skills of sailing such as tack and jibe were demonstrated well. I especially like the part of the Commordore's demonstration with a model boat, which conveys the concepts of sailing very well. One of the shortcoming of this dvd that I noticed was it was only 27 minutes 20 second long.",1186790400,,460,4.621951219512195
