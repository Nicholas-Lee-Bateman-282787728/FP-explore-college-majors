8406330,4,B003V19CKE,"Robert Vaughn known as Napoleon Solo from Man from Uncle is one of the coolest actors
of all time. He was also great in the Protectors TV series. I thought I'd try this out
since it was cheap. It's one of the foreign films american actors always seem to make
at some point back then. It's not the worst movie ever made by far. Too bad the quality
isn't very good or widescreen. I bought the same movie Double Cross on vhs not knowning
it was same but it was really bad quality. don't make the same mistake. The movie is
written and directed pretty good and has good plot. You can see Vaughn over dubbed his
lines it's pretty funny. It's a good bad movie to have if you like Vaughn.",1367020800,2,681,4.166666666666667
8406331,3,B003V19CKE,"AKA Blue Jeans and Dynamite, Double Cross, Atraco en la jungla. Robert Vaughn is Tony, an aging jaded stuntman working in Spain, approached by old friend Luis (Simn Andreu) with a scheme to heist a $10 million gold mask from a museum. They are hindered by policemen, girlfriends, and Aztecs.
In 10 word synopsis across the web this film is referred to as an ""actioner"". It's actually a chase or caper film -- a cash poor Ocean's Eleven. Film has a nice low-budget Euro feel to it, with Andreu funny as a debt-ridden playboy, Katia Christine spunky and attractive as Tony's stunt-girl girlfriend, and Vaughn turning in a cold performance as the self serving Tony. Vaughn, a good actor, sort of laughs and eye rolls his way through this one. He smiles and mugs pretty much without letting us and the other actors in on the joke. He only really comes to life in a scene comparing himself to a great boxer past his prime.
I found ""3-Way Split"" (or ""Double Cross"") a lot more enjoyable than similarly budgeted films of this era. Nice movie to watch on a Sunday evening with a cheap bottle of Spanish wine. The locales were at turns dingy and beautiful, the filmed moved at a breakneck pace, the supporting roles were well cast, and Neila Moranta as Andreu's inescapable girlfriend (no other film credits) was gorgeous. Nice theme! The music was surprisingly good. The editing and sound were problematic. In my copy Robert Vaughn's voice often sounded as if he'd been sucking helium! And in one scene a deep-voiced baritone with a slight accent dubbed Vaughn. The difference was quite noticable. 3 out of 5 stars.",1297468800,2,1607,4.702127659574468
8406332,4,B003V19CKE,"This movie has it all. Action, suspense and angry Incas! The twist at the end is just an added bonus! Nothing to be taken seriously but entertaining none the less.",1291939200,2,163,4.466666666666667
