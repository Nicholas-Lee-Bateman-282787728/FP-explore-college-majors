3875289,5,B0028YW39M,"Although the film may be viewed as just another liberal agenda promotion by some, I'm no liberal and this film carries a beautiful message.  At some point we need to understand that natural resources, human dignity, mutual respect, and community values have a worth that can surpass political agendas, real estate appraisals, tax dollars, and commercial expansion.  The film shows why, does so in a convincing way while showcasing the people involved and the personal sacrifices they are willing to endure.

An interesting film to watch that complements Fierce Light is ""Between 2 Worlds,"" available on Prime and YouTube. Fierce Light is the better film, but Worlds has an indigenous perspective you may find interesting.",1371081600,2,721,5.252173913043478
3875290,4,B0028YW39M,"This DVD is a documentary that follows several stories of human injustices all over the world, from The Farm incident in South Central Los Angeles, to the forced segregation of the Dalit (lower class) people of India. Velcrow Ripper brings to light these injustices as well as focusing on the courageous way that those who suffered through these events stood firm in their beliefs and rights as humans in a non-violent way.

The film features segments that include Thich Nhat Hanh, Desmond Tutu, Micheal Beckwith and a host of others that provide compelling and inspiring perspectives in their stories.  Where most documentaries about activism that I have encountered solely focus on the negative, this film provides a positive aspect on the events covered through the people themselves. The Film itself is well done, balanced, objective and very entertaining.  I would recommend this Film for any home library.

3875291,5,B0028YW39M,"Peoples all around the world, including the US, find it necessary to stand together in their struggles against major corporations and corrupt governments. At the same time, we're all working harder to earn the money simply to survive.  This beautiful, inspiring film shows how shared spiritual paths in community provide on-going vision, guidance and support in these struggles -- which are successful far more often than we know.
The people I know who have seen this film walk away with a direct experience of the Fierce Light, or power of Soul for Good that director Velcrow Ripper refers to.  Anyone who cares about current issues and community needs to buy this film!  Everyone I know who has seen this film LOVES it!",1271980800,,721,4.89344262295082

It's moving and profound, inspiring and informative...the best kind of ""entertaining"" pass-time for conscious or inquisitive beings. But it's beautifully shot and sounds great.

3875295,4,B0028YW39M,"This intimate comment on the nature of humanity - with warts! is personal and profound without being tiresome.  Both Scared Sacred and Fierce Light offer something not often found in a film experience - wide eyed hope.  The people whose lives are portrayed, including the famous, are action heroes in the right sense of the word.  It is difficult to remain inert in light of their example.  The young should see this film - it won't be wasted on them.",1250812800,7,451,4.6
3875296,4,B0028YW39M,I watched this film while feeling a state of despair of all the evil in the world today.  I immediately felt so much better.  This is a GOOD film in both senses of the world.  Beautiful filming and editing also!,1431043200,,211,4.225

3875300,2,B0028YW39M,It documented certain people who have stood up against oppression and went over spirituality what it is and how combined with action can cause tremendous change. I was hoping to hear a more well rounded view of spirituality especially pertaining to animal abuse/agriculture and it's destruction of the Earth and it's children. Also the personal changes that need to take place to make this world without violence. One cannot kill and rape others and expect to be free. This is not limited to humans as we are one in terms of spirituality. This is why we cannot get along.,1415404800,,571,4.777777777777778

3875304,4,B0028YW39M,"Fierce Light is a fairly interesting piece of work. I only have a couple of complaints about it. For one, it is kind of disjointed and bit hard to follow in parts. My only other complaint is that I still get the feeling that all of the protests were not as ""nonviolent"" as they were made out to be. This film seems especially relevant, though, having watched it shortly before the riots broke out in Ferguson, Missouri. While I honestly had some doubts, I was able to view confirmed footage of police firing plastic bullets and tear gas on peaceful demonstrators (as well as tear gassing and arresting news crews who were breaking no laws). After Ferguson, Fierce Light became a lot more believable to me.

At the time I watched Fierce Light, I was reading a book by Brian McLaren called, ""Everything Must Change: When the World's Biggest Problems and Jesus' Good News Collide."" There were a couple of paragraphs in it that I thought was especially fitting to one scene in Fierce Light. At approximately twenty-five minutes into Fierce Light, while attending a support-our-troops-type rally held at Ft. Benning, a Pastor Emanuel Wiggins embarrassingly attempts to justify war using the Bible. On the same day, there was a protest across town from Ft. Benning attempting to shut down a government program that trained snipers, presumably some of the same snipers used to shoot peaceful protesters in South America.

These are the relevant paragraphs from McLaren's book:

----

Nowhere is [Jesus'] message clearer than in his prophetic action on what we call Palm Sunday. One imagines Herod, two links down in Caesar's chain of command, coming into Jerusalem on one side of town. He is attended by horses and chariots and guards armed with swords and spears. On the other side of town, Jesus also enters the city, not riding a white steed or state-of-the-art chariot but a humble donkey, cheered by crowds of poor and humble people who wave not swords and spears but palm branches and colorful coats. They don't celebrate the one who comes in the name of Caesar and the empire of Rome, but the one who comes in the name of the Lord, proclaiming the kingdom of God.

Yes, Herod and Caesar trust in chariots and warhorses, but Jesus comes in a different manner: to proclaim ""peace to the nations.""

----

Yes, on one side of town, you had an odd and eclectic group of protestors, who ""wave not swords and spears but palm branches and colorful coats."" And on the other side of town, you have the people that trust in chariots and warhorses! Yes, how fitting an image!

A few other notable things in Fierce Light was an OK interview with Noah Levine, author of Dharma Punx, and Daryl Hannah protesting to keep an inner-city garden from being sold and destroyed to make room for a warehouse.

All in all, it wasn't a high-budget production, but it did have a lot of feeling to it.",1408320000,2,2874,4.6978131212723655

3875308,2,B0028YW39M,This movie began with violence which was intended to show the reason for action. Action was primarily in the form of demonstrations.  Spiritual action is a lot more than that.
