8078032,5,B000ADS68U,"It is a bummer that Ari has his guitar tuned down a step, but... His instruction is great, and to my ear is true to the notes played on Fuller's recordings. I've also really enjoyed the choice of songs, starting with Untrue Blues. Between the included tab, the instruction he gives and the clear split screen video it is relatively easy to see how to play the songs. You'll have to watch the video more than once to pickup all the details. After that, of course, its just a matter of practice to play the songs well.",1519776000,,516,4.329896907216495
8078033,2,B000ADS68U,"Somebody needs to revisit the idea of doing a Blind Boy Fuller instructional DVD - Nobody can find fault with Eisenger's playing but he's a lousy teacher. From an pedagogical standpoint, one of this company's least useful titles.",1468195200,,229,5.052631578947368
8078034,3,B000ADS68U,"There are some amazing but difficult things to learn, one aspect that bothers me is how much is left out and that the guitar is tuned down a whole step in this video lesson.",1400630400,,173,4.117647058823529
8078035,4,B000ADS68U,"Ari Eisinger is a great picker and singer and his Fuller tunes are great examples of Fuller's repertoire. Eisinger's instruction is pretty sparse compared to say much of Stefan Grossman's and one really has to figure technique stuff out by viewing and viewing again his split screen takes. Tabs of music would be a little more helpful if single string runs indicate up and down strokes he uses. Still, one can learn a lot from this DVD and much can be adopted to other songs by Fuller and others and visa versa. that is, other tunes by other artists can be supplemented by Fuller ideas.",1309046400,4,586,4.59047619047619
