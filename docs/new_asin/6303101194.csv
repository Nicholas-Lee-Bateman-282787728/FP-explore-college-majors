567168,5,6303101194,"One would be hard pressed to find a tale more inspiring and devastating than the plot to kill Adolf Hitler on July 20th, 1944.

Led by Colonel Claus Josef Von Stauffenberg, a high ranking German officer, devout Catholic, scholar and badly wounded veteran of WW1,
the element of chance in the ultimate failure of his heroic historical gesture is chilling.  Played by a youthful Brad Davis, the gentle and firm nature of the man is conveyed well.

Slowly becoming aware of the atrocities that the Third Reich were committing in Poland and the Eastern Front in general, Stauffenberg
originally planned to a coup--develop a shadow government and overthrow the SS, thereby rendering Hitler powerless.  Reality set in after awhile, however, and Stauffenberg was granted the privilege and curse of seeing Adolf Hitler then as we see him now: a mass murdering psychopath.

Returning from Tunesia after surviving a combat related attack which rendered him blind in one eye, he told his brother Berthold (one of his only loyal co-conspirator when all hell broke loose) that he was willing to sacrifice his life to kill Hitler.

His decision would have a horribly adverse effect in the sense of taking countless lives and, most tragically, the torture and garrotting of Berthold, but had it succeeded Stauffenberg would be up there in the history books, and rightly so, with Martin Luther King, Gandhi, and a host of other great men.  The film skips over his original indecision: whether to shoot Hitler (bad idea, since there were crackshot marksmen around him at all times), and a suicide bombing at an art museum in which only Stauffenberg and Hitler would perish (Hitler never showed up, changing his schedule once again).  Stauffenberg knew his time was limited and that at some point Hitler would be in hiding somewhere and the concentration camps would be running as always even as his evil empire went into ruin.

The day came.  Depicted perfectly and with no historical inaccuracies in this film, Stauffenberg walked into Hitler ""Wolf's Lair"" and set a bomb
in a briefcase beside him.  It was a heavy oak table.

A German officer in the room who was advising Hitler, Colonel Brendt, got up and moved the briefcase because it was in his way.

A matter of hours later, Adolf Hitler was on the radio in Germany shouting that ""Divine Providence had saved him for his Mission"".  The irony is crushing.

The scene in which Stauffenberg is executed is done dramatically here: he did not merely snivel and recite passages from the Bible hopelessly, but gave a proud should before the last shot was fired: ""Long Live Our Sacred Germany!""",1187308800,4,2626,4.8961625282167045
567169,4,6303101194,This film is about a group of hitlers senior army officers who are ploting to assinate hitler to try to save whats left of war torn germany. This movie stars the story of Col.claus von Stauffenberg who volenteers the mission of planting a bomb next to hitler in a meeting at his Wolf's lair. A good movie that shows the struggle within the third reich and its final monthes to remove hitler from power and save germany from defeat.,1124582400,,431,4.468354430379747
567170,4,6303101194,"I very much enjoyed this film because the producers did their best to stay ""true to history,"" rather than try to ""hollywood,"" it. The saga of colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is a historical tale of bravery, personal risk and raises many interesting discussions on World War II.  As an adjunct professor I have often shown this movie to my college students to get them to consider issues such as treason, following conscience vs following orders, and ""what if"" scenarios.  After a read of William Shirer's Classic book entitled ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"" this movie is even more enjoyable. Of course, I wish the film makers went to two solid hours and provided even more facts, tidbits and information on the extensive German resistance movement.  I highly recommend this movie as an excellent discussion vehicle and as an exciting story.  It never ceases to amaze me how a bomb that explodes  within six feet of Hitler failed to kill him and how Stauffenberg risked not only his life and career, but literally the lives of his whole family, associates and friends.  This film presents another classic example of a ""near miss,"" that most people wish had not. The acting is adequate and Madolyn Smith and Brad Davis do better here than when they did the Robert Kennedy film together (in my opinion). This is a great film to rent for a rainy weekend day that will certainly raise excellent family discussions.  It is to be noted that had the revolt succeeded, the war would have ended nine months earlier and countless combat and concentration camp deaths might have been avoided.  Every Year on July 20th, I make a point to mention this story to friends and usually try to watch the film again.  It is important to reflect on events like this to remember those who have died in fighting tyranny.",1008115200,51,1805,4.722929936305732
567171,4,6303101194,"A true story about a group of disgruntled German officers and their plan to eliminate Hitler, and bring Germany back into an age of stability.  Historians have known all along that throughout the existence of the Third  Reich, that many soldiers within the Wermacht where regretting the rule of  Hitler and his SS henchmen.  The film follows an Army colonel through his  career in Africa, to his orginazation of the group that was to kill Hitler.  A great film for anyone who is interested in the history of what actually  went on inside the government of the Third Reich, and the people fighting  for their country.",967420800,11,616,4.745283018867925
567281,4,6303101194,"I first saw this film when it ran on television and I ordered the tape as I wanted to watch it again.  It is a well done recreation of historical events.  Of course, there are some things which will always be debated.  For instance, there are different accounts given as to how involved Rommel was.  Nevertheless, the production values cannot be dismissed and the acting of Brad Davis, as always, is top notch.  There is an increasing sense of tension as the conspirators meet to discuss their plan.  We all know the story, but this movie makes these people real to us.  It makes us understand their motivations and conflicts.  They had sworn allegiance to the army and their country, yet they could no longer stand by and accept the leadership's actions.  They were torn.  It gives us insight into the division between the old aristocracy and those currently in power.  The film manages to take an event that many, sadly, in North America know little about and explain it.  I would love to see this film shown in high school history classes.",1326067200,2,1042,4.633879781420765
567282,4,6303101194,"As a person who appreciates and studies history, I have always been enthralled by the plot to kill Hitler. I've seen most documentaries of the July 20th Plot and was excited that David L. Wolper, a historian himself, produced this movie. I found it far better than the 2008 Valkyrie movie with Tom Cruise. I like Cruise, but found him ill-fitted for the role of Stauffenberg. I think Thomas Kretschmann would've done a better job (he played Major Ramer). This movie centered around how they devised the plan and was detailed in politically and historically correct views. The added necessary drama to keep the flow moving and I wish they would've shown how the plot unfolded, like what steps they used to take control of Berlin after the bomb went off in the Wolf's Lair. Still, it was far better than the recent film. You won't be disappointed. Brad Davis did an excellent job.",1314662400,,878,4.707792207792208
567283,5,6303101194,"I thought this version of the polt to kill Hitler was excellent. Although most of the actors are unknown to me, I did recongize the woman who played Staffenburg's wife, Nina. She played in the movie Funny Farm, with Chevy Chase.",1269648000,,228,4.585365853658536
567284,5,6303101194,"I recorded this when it orginally aired on t.v. i still have the vhs copy,even used it in my history class....wow this film will be in my movie collection.",1250380800,,155,4.379310344827586
567285,3,6303101194,A very good film depicting how there were Germans who did not agree with what Hitler was doing and their actions in attempting to stop the carnage.  A very good film worth watching.,1239321600,,181,4.484848484848484
567286,5,6303101194,"I ordered this DVD from Germany after seeing the Cruise version in the movie theatre.  I rarely go to see films on the big screen, but having been filmed partly in Berlin, which I am very familiar with, I wanted to see what United Artists, Singer, Cruise et al. did with the available settings.  I was not disappointed in that respect.  However, Brad Davis and the cast on this film do an excellent job--very true to the history, this begins with an encounter between Stauffenberg and Rommel--whereas the General in the UA version is ""mythical.""  As we all know, Rommel was killed for suspected involvement long after he oversaw the Atlantic Wall defenses, was severely injured, and went back to Germany to recuperate and celebrate his wife's birthday. Manfred Rommel appears in documentaries telling this story--and it is a sad one, as Rommel has been ""recuperated"" as a German hero as has Stauffenberg.

I strongly recommend this version as opposed to the 1950s German versions, which are a bit stiff.  The German DVD from Amazon.de included not only the English soundtrack and English subtitles, but as is not unusualy, about 14 other languages in sound and subtitle, so is very useful for language students as well.  These are much better buys for the dollar (or euro), as are often UK DVDs.  If Davis' wearing of white rather than the Reserve Army rose color piping is incorrect or can be overlooked, it is a minor detail.

Thus, as with the Associate Professor, go with this version if you are interested in the history of the resistance itself.  There were over 40 attempts on Adolf's life--if only others were so well documented the average international view of Germans and Germany would be more accurate.",1235952000,3,1714,4.839041095890411
567287,4,6303101194,"This 1990 movie was better than I expected.  Video and audio quality of the DVD were outstanding and the plot held my interest throughout.  Acting and production values were all quite good, despite the absence of  big-name stars.  Brad Davis as Col. von Stauffenberg and Madolyn Smith as his wife Nina are convincing in their tragic parts.  Mike Gwilym also does a fine job playing the monster, Adolph Hitler.

Yes, as other reviewers have said, the show does have the feel of a made-for-TV production and there are a few historical flaws.  Producers were the Wolpers and that can't be all bad.  They did produce other things like ""Roots"" and ""The Thornbirds,"" as well as some outstanding war documentaries.  European filming was done in Yugoslavia which lends an authentic aura throughout.  As noted above, video quality was extremely good, making me think the movie was re-mastered somehow.  I found no graininess, dropouts, or other problems with the video.  It's really first rate all the way.

It would have been nice to see a little more of the late Ian Richardson, one of my favorite actors.  Nevertheless, he plays Gen. Beck who didn't have a major part in the story due to ill health.  Also, a recent documentary piece on the subject would have been nice to add to ""Special Features.""  Still, the movie covers an important topic--efforts by brave Germans to rid themselves of Hitler.  This may have saved the country from being totally dismantled after the war.

A useful touch at the end was to credit Stauffenberg with having several streets and other public places named after him in post-war Germany.  Although not popular right after the war, it may be seen now as a just tribute to a courageous, patriotic man.  Those of us with German blood in our veins can take solace from this.

I haven't seen the new movie with Tom Cruise playing Stauffenberg but intend to do so after seeing, ""The Plot to Kill Hitler.""  Let's hope when the DVD appears it will have Special Features which add to our understanding of why the plot failed. It's been estimated that 10 million more people died because of that.

567288,3,6303101194,I just so the Tom Cruise movie on this Christmas day of 2008. I in all honesty this made for TV movie was a bit better done. Brad Davis seemed to bring more depth to Von Staufenberg than did Cruise. So I would give this 3 stars and Valkyrie 2 and a half.,1230163200,4,254,3.811320754716981
567289,2,6303101194,David Wolper's full length TV feature revisted the subject of his Emmy winning Appointment with Destiny episode on the July plot but the result was far inferior to the original.

7838389,5,6303101194,"Being a Baby Boomer I grew up on World War Two movies. Now that I am a senior citizen I feel that these movies are more relevant than ever before. There is an entire generation or two of young Americans that know nothing about that war or the reasons for it. And they don't care to know anything about it. This is disgraceful. This disgrace will eventually lead to it happening again. These movies, be they fiction or fact, need to be watched and events never forgotten.",1433116800,,470,4.413793103448276

7838396,4,6303101194,"I approached this film preparing not to like it. But I changed my mind after seeing it. Although I generally have problems with key German characters speaking standard English, once I got into the movie, I had little problem with this. All in all a good production.

Only so much can be handled in a 93 minute film. That's where books come in.
