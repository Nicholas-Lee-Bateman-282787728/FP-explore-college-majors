7850697,4,6303593151,The movie portrays the plight of a poor family from the north of Holland that moves to Amsterdam to seek their fortune during the industrial revolution. It helps to know some basic Dutch because the subtitles are  quite bad and detract from the film.  Social settings and dialogue in the  film are quite colorful and intense when compared to plodding Hollywood  films. Depiction of business ethics displays significant cultural bias and  is probably enough to make many modern Americans break out laughing.,924998400,5,506,5.121951219512195
