Director Federico Veiroj (his debut) succeeds in evoking a teenage sense of lust and angst among the elder members of the community, but the film does not have much to say except that. ""Acn"" begins promisingly with a convincing portrayal of a young boy, but soon becomes boring, not knowing where it wants to go.

The film's story follows the life of Rafael Bregman (Alejandro Tocar), a 13-year-old boy of a Jewish family living in Montevideo. Apparently his family is rich middle-class, as Rafael is seen taking a piano lesson and playing tennis. Also, he has lost his virginity and goes to the local brothel. But Rafael is not really interested in any of them.

Rafael likes to hang around with his best friend Andy after school, but he is going to Israel. What Rafael really wants to do is kissing a beautiful girl named Nicole Weiss, the school's most popular girl.

While the genre of coming-of-age story is universal, it also needs something unique and interesting in it to grab our attention - something ""Acn"" does not have. The idea of a teenage boy of an affluent family, who can get everything except a kiss, is not bad, but the way his story is told is too flat in ""Acn,"" where we are allowed to know little about our protagonist Rafael and the community he belongs to.

Rafael seems too discontent when we know that he shouldn't. The film wraps up with Rafael's transformation which is too late and abrupt. By the time this happens, most viewers would stop caring, not knowing how to relate to the boy who often appears too self-absorbed, if not self-centered.",1345507200,2,1740,4.6396103896103895

A story about a boy with acne, who is either at home, school or the dermatologist's office.  The only interesting parts are when he visits the local brothel, but there is no skin shots at all.  It's a shame I can't get my money back on this one.",1315785600,3,374,3.8815789473684212
