1611319,2,B00005JXYT,"Video hunk Casper van Dien surfaces as a wrongly accused murderer in the made for TV Night Scream.  A muddled script and a less than marvelous cast hinder the overall effect of this baffling mystery.  Candace Cameron Bure plays the dual role of Laura Fairgate, a young beauty murdered..supposedly by her boyfriend van Dien.  She also plays Drew, a double for the murdered girl, who mysteriously shows up in Laura's hometown on the anniversary of her murder.  We find out Drew's really van dien's new girlfriend, who he has asked to go through this charade in order to clear his name.  Teri Garr appears as Laura's grief-stricken mother, and that's about it..she appears.  Garr, a capable actress, has little emotion in her weak and lifeless portrayal.  Garr has remarried a man who didn't approve of her late husband's plans for the little town of Shrevestown, Oregon..hint, hint.
Cameron is not a strong enough actress to carry off this duplicity convincingly, and it is ultimately her lack of real talent, that sabotages this movie.
It has a few twists, but little suspense, and has all the markings of a t.v. movie.  Not that that's bad, but it hurts this one!",1083196800,3,1163,4.809045226130653

7942594,4,B00005JXYT,"Drew (Candace Cameron Bure) finds herself in a strange town acting like Laura Fairgate, a girl who was killed. She appears to be possessed by the girl who was murdered by her boyfriend. There is a question as to who was the real murderer and if Drew is really possessed. Drew causes problems in this small community which just wants to move on.

The film has a number of interesting twists. I wasn't expecting the twists with this being a made for TV Lifetime film. The dialogue was horrible and even Teri Garr couldn't sound convincing. However the plot was engaging more than usual. This is not a horror movie. It is a low end thriller. A better Lifetime film in my opinion.",1397779200,2,676,4.495934959349594
7942595,5,B00005JXYT,This is a great movie - I remember seeing it on Lifetime Movie Network years ago but never knew what it was called.

7942597,1,B00005JXYT,I love this movie but I bought it from amazon and I just tried to play it and I couldn't. It had tons of scratches on it and was basically a horrible copy. I would get the movie but just not from this source :(,1327622400,3,210,3.688888888888889
7942598,2,B00005JXYT,"I watched this movie on tv as a teenager and remembered loving it so I bought it. I must've had bad taste as a teen! Although it wasn't the worst movie I'd ever seen, it was pretty bad. You'd think Candace Cameron would be able to act a little better after all those years on Full House. I found myself getting embarrassed for her!",1247097600,5,331,4.1875
7942599,4,B00005JXYT,Candance Cameron was great in this movie she really made you feel for the character and the difficulty she was going through.  You kind of cheered and was fearful for her through the whole movie. Worth Watching!!,1234310400,4,212,4.72972972972973
