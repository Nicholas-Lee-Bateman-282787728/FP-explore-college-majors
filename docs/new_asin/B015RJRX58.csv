8734359,5,B015RJRX58,"HERE IT IS, KILL LA KILL, THE ENTIRE SERIES!! YAY!! YIPPEEE!!! Okay, let me calm down here. I ordered this under the impression that I could get it for WAAAAY cheaper than what these other guys are selling theirs for, and I was RIGHT!!! For $29.99, I got THE ENTIRE SERIES, EXCEPT for THE LAST CHAPTER (25). I figure I could get it somewhere down the line, it's on a Anime app where you can watch it, so all is not lost. BUT, this is THE BARGAIN OF THE CENTURY, for anyone wanting this SWEET SERIES!!! It's in Japanese and a couple of other foreign languages, but has English subtitles. WELL WORTH IT!!! Thank You TeddySmiles!!!",1454630400,4,628,4.422413793103448
