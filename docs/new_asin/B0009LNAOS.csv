 With thanks to Michael Den Boer.

Foreign cinema has long had a history of being altered when said films are released in America. Screamers original began as an Italian film known as The Island of the Fishmen. It was picked up for U.S. distribution in the early part of the 1980s when those involved with this release felt it needed something extra to help it complete with the much more violent and gory Slasher films that were at the peak of their popularity.

Essentially the difference between Screamers and The Island of the Fishmen is a newly shot twelve minute opening sequence with Mel Ferrer and Cameron Mitchell and a series of more gory shots that has been well placed throughout the film. Also for the most part this newly shot footage actually blends in well with the original footage that was shot by Sergio Martino.

Plot wise though things are basically the same, the main difference between these two films being in their tones. Where The Island of the Fishmen is a more lighthearted action /adventure, Screamers goes for a more Horror / Sci-Fi vibe. Also besides adding new footage, the other new addition to Screamers includes the score which features some different musical cues. Overall though there is plenty to enjoy about this alternate version of this film, there is still a part of me that prefers to see it the way that Sergio Martino intended it to be seen.

The DVD:

Scorpion Releasing presents Screamers in an anamorphic widescreen that retains the films intended scope aspect ratio. For this release a brand new Hi Def transfer has been created from the original IP. Being that this film comes from two completely different sources, the original footage was shot Techniscope and the new footage was shot using a different albeit anamorphic process then Techniscope. This leads too there being a distinct difference between the two used sources. And it is not surprising that the newly shot scenes look a tad better than the footage that was shot by Sergio Martino. The Newly shot opening and other footage looks great as details look crisp, colors look vibrant, black and contrast levels look consistently strong throughout. With that being said the Martino shot footage also looks very good. Overall this a strong Hi Def transfer that should look even better on Blu-Ray.

This release comes with one audio option, a Dolby Digital mono mix in English. The audio mixes is also in great shape as dialog is always clear, everything sounds balanced and robust when it needs too. Also the more ambient aspects of the soundtrack are well represented.

Extras for this release include trailers for Screamers and Something Waits in the Dark (1 minutes 56 seconds  anamorphic widescreen), a stills gallery and interviews with Joe Dante (4 minutes 4 seconds  anamorphic widescreen), Miller Drake (11 minutes 58 seconds  anamorphic widescreen), Jim Wynorski (10 minutes 50 seconds  anamorphic widescreen), Roger Corman (3 minutes 21 seconds  anamorphic widescreen) and Clark Henderson (10 minutes 50 seconds  anamorphic widescreen). Topics discussed include how each person got involved with this project, how producers Richard Kay and Harry Rybnick bought the U.S. rights to Island of the Fishmen and wanted to add some more scenes with American actors, casting, locations, the special effects involving turning a man inside out, how Roger Corman got involved and the multiple releases under different titles. Rounding out the extras are trailers for Seizure, Night of the Cobra Woman, Stripped to Kill, Sorority House Massacre, Sorceress, Day of the Animals, Dogs and Grizzly. Overall Screamers finally arrives on home video via an exceptional release from Scorpion Releasing, highly recommended.

Note: Scorpion Releasing are also releasing this title on Blu-Ray.",1403308800,12,3894,5.071987480438184

2299411,2,B0009LNAOS,"Screamers (Sergio Martino, 1979)

I first stumbled across Screamers, Roger Corman's butchery of Sergio Martino's flick Island of the Fishmen, back in the early eighties at my local video store. Given the infamous tagline and cover art ('they're humans turned inside-out!'), I knew I'd have to rent it sooner rather than later. I already had the max sitting in my hands, though, so I resolved to grab it next time I went to the store. Well, I went back a couple of days later to return everything, and it was gone. Never, as it turned out, to return. Over the years, it became less of an obsession, though the tagline always stuck in the back of my head. Back in 1982, I had only the barest idea of who Roger Corman was (and had never made the connection with Corman's own fish-men movie, Humanoids from the Deep, released the year afterwards), and no idea who Sergio Martino was. At that point, for me, ""Italian"" was synonymous with Lucio Fulci and Federico Fellini. (I hadn't even discovered Tornatore yet. Truly, I was a deprived child.) Well, when I finally happened upon a copy in early 2011--almost thirty years later--I knew a whole lot more about Roger Corman, a tad more about Martino (whom I've never held in the regard many other giallo fans do), and more than I could ever want to about both versions of Humanoids from the Deep. And yet I sat down to watch this, expecting it to be just as bad as the rest of the creature features from the late seventies/early eighties that Corman had messed with. And terrible it is, though it's worlds better than Humanoids from the Deep. (Either version.)

It's quite interesting, given that the pedigree of Screamers is so readily apparent that it appears in almost every review, that the unofficial IMDB ""based on"" credit goes to H. P. Lovecraft (""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"", also one of the bases for Brian Yuzna's Dagon more than a decade later). While there are a few ghosts of ""Innsmouth"" to be found here, as everyone else will tell you as well, the real bones for this story come from The Island of Dr. Moreau; the only change is that the crazy doctor, Ernest Marvin (one of the final screen roles for the late, great Joseph Cotten), has been experimenting on fish instead of monkeys. But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all starts when a prison boat is shipwrecked. The ship's doctor/lieutenant, Claude de Ross (Alligator's Claudio Cassinelli), and two of his convict charges wash up on the beach of a secluded island (unmapped, of course, as every island in every Italian horror film made in the seventies and early eighties is), where they are greeted by Amanda (Caveman beauty Barbara Bach). She tries to warn them away from the island. When that doesn't work, they run into Edmond Rackham (Zombi 2's Richard Johnson), who also informs them, in a slightly more civilized manner, that they really have no choice but to leave. One of the convicts (I can't remember which, and honestly it doesn't much matter), who's become quite accustomed to freedom in a few short days, grabs a horse and takes off for even more secluded pastures, presumably the other side of the island. Instead, he turns up dead, and de Ross starts getting the idea that something strange is afoot. You'd think he'd have figured that out when everyone he met on the island told him he needed to leave, and pronto...

I left out of the synopsis that Corman's American version (it's this cut which actually has the title Screamers) has an eleven-minute introductory piece that has not a blessed thing to do with the rest of the movie, and was tacked on so Corman could put Mel Ferrer's name in the credits as an American theatrical draw (Barbara Bach, two years after Bond Girl-dom, was already not enough of a draw, it seems; she abandoned her movie career in the mid-eighties). You can safely ignore it. The rest of the movie is your basic silly Italian monster feature, with even less coherence thanks to Corman's editing job than one finds in such Italian monster-movie classics as Dr. Butcher, M.D. or Burial Ground. It's actually kind of stylish, and the whole expressionist thing that Argento was doing and kind of bled over into the rest of Italian horror cinema for a few years is in full effect here (mostly in the color work), but the amount of gore is overstated in most commentary about the film I've read (this seems to be a common theme with Martino movies; perhaps Martino's viewers aren't used to Fulci or Lenzi's contemporaneous films?), the dubbing is execrable when it's not hysterical, and as I already said, the plot is barely coherent, when it hasn't been clubbed to death by Corman. May be worth hunting down a copy of the original cut, but I wasn't moved to add it to the list. **",1300233600,4,4732,4.651135005973716

8062910,3,B0009LNAOS,"This 1979 science fiction flick was directed by the well-known Italian director Sergio Martino under the Italian title L'isola degli uomini pesce, a perfect match of the English, the Island of the Fishmen. The film was released in the US under the title Screamers. Herein I compare the two versions of film based on Scorpions BR release of Screamers, and on the European release of Island of the Fishmen by Digi Dream (available at Amazon Germany under the German title Insel der Neuen Monster).

Film story

After their prison ship sinks in the Caribbean, a group of prisoners and Lt. Claude de Ross (a physician played by Claudio Cassinelli) arrive to a seemingly deserted island. However, they soon find out that Edmond Rackham (played by Richard Johnson) runs the place. Edmond keeps Amanda (played by Barbara Bach) as hostage at his house to blackmail his father, Prof. Ernest Marvin (played by Joseph Cotten). Prof. Marvin has been able to experimentally produce a breed between human and fish whom can survive a world catastrophe on land. He does this with a fluid which also acts as a drug and keeps fishmen fed and willing to follow orders. In particular, Edmond is using these amphibian hybrids to scavenge the riches of Atlantis.

Screamers was the title chosen for the US release of this film in 1980. Major difference with the original version? The US cut included the addition of a few scenes to make the film more violent and gory. Most notably, a 12 min long scene was added as the introductory scene, including Cameron Mitchel in it. In exchange, the original opening scene with a view of survivors on the wreck during daylight was removed.

Overall, this is not really a horror, but more of a science fiction and adventure movie. It has the old touch of late seventies though, so it should be well received by nostalgic fans of that time of cinema like myself.

Technical features

Scorpion provides a very nice transfer of Screamers. Image comes in a nice widescreen format, with vibrant colors and good BR definition. The main feature runs for ca. 90 minutes. The audio comes in English, and no subtitles are provided. The extras include several interviews, including one by the legend director Sergio Martino.

The Digi Dream blu-ray transfer of Island of the Fishmen is only ok, if not a discrete DVD quality at best. The image seems to be shopped version adapted to appear widescreen in appearance, and runs for about nearly 94 minutes, 4 min longer than the US cut, but still shorter than the 100 min reported by IMDB. The audio comes in German or English (no subtitles are provided). No extras are provided. Yet, the release also includes ""The Fishmen and their Queen"", a late 1995 and quite bad Martino flick partially assambled with footage from other films of his (most notably from: 2019: After the Fall of New York).",1522022400,,2846,4.795918367346939

This DVD's excellent special features include several interviews with people involved in the recut and its marketing, explaining the why of it.

Roger Corman was given the opportunity to distribute L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce, but the film, while horror, is a rubber-suit monster movie. Corman believed that American horror fans at the time were mostly interested in slasher films. So Corman cut some 20 minutes out of the Italian film, and filmed an additional 15 minutes (mostly a prologue). The additional scenes and some of the poster artwork (the monster's fingernail resembled a slasher's knife) allowed Corman to market the film, now retitled Something Waits in the Dark, as a slasher film. His trailers (included in the DVD) implied that Screamers is mostly about monsters that rape women.

Corman later re-remarketed the film as about ""a man turned inside out,"" re-retitling it Screamers. The newly shot ""inside out"" footage used in that trailer was not used in the re-recut film, causing a riot at one Georgia drive-in. So Corman inserted that very brief footage (which makes no sense in any version of the film) to please audiences.

The special feature interviews include Corman, and people involved in directing, editing, and marketing the new scenes and film versions.

It's all very interesting from a historical perspective. Even so, I think Corman was wrong to recut the film. As a horror fan, while I enjoy Screamers, I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/l-isola-degli-uomini-pesce/dp/B000CCTDPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">l'isola degli uomini pesce</a>.

I first saw Screamers over 30 years ago on broadcast TV. Later as an Embassy VHS cassette. Then I bought the Italian DVD (available only on PAL), and now this Blu-Ray Screamers.

The Corman prologue is okay, but unnecessary. It adds nothing to the film. Screamers is about 89 minutes long, L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce is 95 minutes. This means the Italian version has about 20 minutes you won't find on Screamers (which has 15 minutes you won't find on L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce).

The core story remains the same. The year is 1891. Rackham (Richard Johnson) is a white land baron who owns an uncharted Caribbean island. Primitive black natives obey his every whim. He's hired a well-intentioned mad scientist, Dr. Marvin (Joseph Cotten), to turn the natives into fishmen, so as to harvest undersea gold from the lost civilization of Atlantis. Amanda (Barbara Bach) is Dr. Marvin's beautiful daughter, who communicates with the fishmen, who love her.

The hunky Claude (Claudio Cassinelli), a doctor on a prison ship, crashes onto the island, along with several prisoners. He uncovers Rackham's evil scheme, even as the fishmen kill off various people.

If you've seen Screamers, you're missing a lot (20 minutes) from the original film. A few scenes are missing entirely, but mostly its scenes that have been trimmed. Things that are implied in Screamers are explicitly stated in L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce.

SOME OF WHAT'S MISSING ...

* We sense that Rackham has the hots for Amanda, but it's never explicit in Screamers. But in  L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce he speaks of his jealousy for her, calls her his wife, and later admits that she's ""not yet"" his wife.

* We sense that Dr. Marvin might be in trouble in Screamers, whereas in L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce, Rackham explicitly states that he keeps Amanda in line by threatening to kill Marvin.

* We sense that Shakira and Amanda are at odds in Screamers, but in L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce Amanda explicitly accuses Shakira of spying on her.

* Quick action events (e.g., the killing of Francois; the attempted rape of Amanda by another prisoner) are drawn out in L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce, allowing for drawn-out suspenseful buildup, or drawn-out chase scenes.

* There's a voodoo ritual scene in Screamers, but two such scenes in L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce.

* During dinner, Claude diagnoses Rackham of misanthropy. In L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce, Claude later changes his diagnosis to paranoia.

* Additional dialog between Claude and Amanda, and between other characters. The missing dialog is usually a line or two here and there. Trims from scenes rather than missing scenes.

* The final scene/credit roll of Screamers has a fishman swimming ominously underwater. In  L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce, the credits roll over a shot of Claude and Amanda embracing on a raft, a beautiful pink sky behind them. Corman opted for horror, the Italians for romance.

* One of the BIG differences (allegedly) is the transformation of Jose into a fishman. Claude and Amanda are horrified to find Jose-as-fishman in a laboratory tank. Corman redid the fishman, replacing his version with the Italian version. Supposedly because, Corman thought, his version was more gruesome, and more like ""a man turned inside out."" I disagree. Both fishmen are equally gruesome. It was an unnecessary bit of work on Corman's part.

Some people, Corman included, think that L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce is too slow moving, and that the trimming, with the addition of the prologue, makes for a faster-paced, more gruesome film. I don't think so. I find that the original version is well-paced, and makes for a richer film, with the characters and their relationships more fully developed.

I like both versions, but I prefer the Italian.

Film students should enjoy watching and comparing both versions, studying how films can change by what's left in or taken out. Is anything lost when those lines are lost? It's a ripe topic for discussion and analysis.

A COMPARISON OF THE VISUALS:

This Screamers is Blu-Ray, and the visuals are nice. But my DVD of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/l-isola-degli-uomini-pesce/dp/B000CCTDPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">l'isola degli uomini pesce</a>&nbsp;also has rich, sharp visuals. I am referring to the NoShame DVD (which I link), and which is widescreen (2.35:1), unlike some other versions.

The NoShame DVD is significantly BRIGHTER than the Screamers Blu-Ray DVD. Barbara Bach is a brunette in the Blu-Ray Screamers, but she's strawberry blonde in the NoShame L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce DVD.

The NoShame DVD has both Italian and English language soundtracks, but only Italian subtitles. If you're a deaf English speaker, you're out of luck.

The NoShame DVD has great special features, including an hour documentary interviewing three of the people involved in the film, and trailers. However, these are all in Italian, without subtitles. So I couldn't understand what they were saying.

I look forward to a Blu-Ray version of L'Isola Degli Uomini Pesce, with English subtitles

Director Sergio Martino, and actors Richard Johnson, Claudio Cassinelli, and Barbara Bach all collaborated on another Italian horror film that same year -- 1979 -- called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Alligator-River/dp/B000AQKUVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Alligator River</a>&nbsp;(aka The Great Alligator).

=============

There seem to be a few bogus 5-star reviews for this film. You can tell because they don't say much, and they post several brief ""reviews"" all on the same day. Sites like Craigslist are full of ads for paid Amazon and Yelp reviewers. How to spot them:

* They say very little in the review. Sometimes they'll reference stuff from the product description (""Parker Posey is a great indie actress"" or ""I love scary movies and this filled the bill.""), but nothing to indicate that they've actually seen the film. Or they'll make pointless (and likely fake) references to their personal lives (""I bought this as a gift for my uncle."")

* They post many reviews on the same day.

* Shill reviewers have gotten more sophisticated, tossing in a few random 1-star reviews (doubtless from people who didn't pay) to appear credible. But they're all on the same day, among large batches of ""reviews.""

* Being a ""Verified Purchaser"" does not mean the reviewer is not a shill, not if other signs are there (little said, many ""reviews"" on the same day).

This is a great film, but shame on the shills.",1419897600,11,8868,5.531065088757397

Too bad he didn't have the rest of the film reshot because the first 12 minutes are pretty creepy, exciting and better than the rest of the film.
