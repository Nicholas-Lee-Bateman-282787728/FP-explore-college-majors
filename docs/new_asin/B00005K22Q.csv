7942852,4,B00005K22Q,"The Underdog show is a fond memory from when I was really young. I thought the semi-cliffhanger endings to the 3 out of 4 chapters for each episode was a neat concept. Whoever wrote these episodes must have been really clever or had some kind of witty imaginations.  No matter what, they would always come up with some kind of rhyming dialogue for Underdog! How'd they do that?

Here are two things that really cracked me up from this series.  In the episode ""The Forget-Me-Net"" there is a scene where Sweet Polly Purebred, suffering from amnesia, is walking down a street called... what else... Memory Lane!  Another episode, ""Guerilla Warfare,"" Underdog's duty is to protect a famous painting, amusingly parodied with the name ""Whistler's Father""!  It's a shame people can't seem to come up with creative comedic ideas like this nowadays.

R.I.P. Wally Cox... you brought Underdog to life!",1228780800,,891,4.946308724832215
7942853,4,B00005K22Q,"This classic cartoon was my absolute favorite as a kid. I thoroughly enjoyed it in my pajamas eating cereal and glued to the TV set early in the AM. While this digitally remastered version is well done, it lacks the true originality of the show. For instance, it is missing the intro 'Don't touch that dial! Watch this exciting seen from today's 4 part story of Underdog! Here it comes now!' It is also missing the segment clip of scenes from other shows that was in the middle of the original show 'You'll see all of this Underdog adventure, complete on today's show. And in weeks to come, you'll see exciting scenes like this:' Since it was in 4-part episodes originally, parts of the scenes are cut in order to remake it uninterrupted which tends to destroy the great suspense music as a part ends. Also, the credits are missing the part where the guy was pasting a poster on the wall and the cop points out the sign that says 'Post No Bills' The segments with the lyrics are complete and in original form, which is a great plus. It is sad that the lyrics and intro themes to the other cartoons affiliated with Underdog are not included. Wow, I am amazing myself how much I remember of this show which is 30+yrs old. Also, absent is the clip where the guy pulls the switch and the marqui says 'Scenes from Next Week's Show' And, eventhough a lot has been taken away from the original, I love this cartoon sooo much, I have to give you 4 stars for remaking it!",1041206400,19,1462,4.3786764705882355
7942854,4,B00005K22Q,"I picked up the Underdog Chronicles to add to my Underdog Collector's Edition DVD. Alas, this new DVD suffers from the same lack of completeness as the Collector's Edition. The cartoon episodes themselves are entertaining and remastered well (except for the audio sometimes, whose volume tends to fade out ever so slightly in places), but every one of the cartoons is missing the original title card and ending credits. All of the title cards have inexplicably been replaced by hokey _ad hoc_ opening titles that make no effort to match the look and feel of the original period. Why these glaring deletions to the body of work were made is unclear; the old title cards and credits contribute much to the nostalgic value of a collection like this, and to omit them detracts from the enjoyment of the experience. (A least the Underdog theme song is present in its several forms.)

Even worse, the auxiliary cartoons that accompanied the Underdog show (this DVD calls them ""Cliffhanger Episodes"") -- namely Tennessee Tuxedo, Go Go Gophers, Commander McBragg, etc. -- are missing their theme songs, title cards and credits. As a result, each cartoon ends abruptly (no outro music or The End card) and you're never quite sure if that's really the end of the cartoon, or if it has been truncated. I'd sure like to know who made these questionable production decisions. They obviously know nothing about continuity or the difference between a great product and a mediocre one.

Still, I love Underdog so much, I've rated this product a 4. If you're not a fan of the series, the deficiencies I've noted probably won't annoy you as much as they did me. If you _are_ a fan of the series, you'll enjoy the cartoons despite the bad decisions made in transcribing them onto DVD.

But it could have been so much better.",1018483200,56,1805,4.778846153846154
7942855,4,B00005K22Q,"The sound on ZOT is not very clear.... It might just be the film. The rest of the episodes are simply wonderful though... I even liked the mini story of Underdog that Joe Harris had made for his kids...
I am not into Go Go Gophers and such, so I skipped them, but those are for people who are fans of those... SORRY...
The Ticklefeather Machine was OK.... Not the best one of the bunch, but I did like the one about the famous painting and Shoeshine's true self is almost discovered...
In future volumes... I would like to see more photos of the people behind the photos, or old interviews on their opinions of Underdog... All in all another welcome addition to my Underdog collection....",1005091200,4,688,4.468253968253968
7942856,5,B00005K22Q,"Underdog is back again on DVD. Included on this release are the cartoons Tennessee Tuxedo,Commander McBragg,Go Go Gophers etc. that were interspersed between the cliffhanger episodes that made up the four part stories of our courageous canine. Each Underdog story is presented WITHOUT the cliffhangers that ended each episode of every story but they are hardly noticed due to the smooth clean edits. The animation is beautiful since this sixties favorite and perennial syndicated rerun staple for over thirty years has been digitally remastered. The familiar theme song once missing when Underdog aired on cable recently is back as well. This DVD is a must have for any true Underdog fan. So have no fear Underdog is here.",997228800,18,722,5.127118644067797
