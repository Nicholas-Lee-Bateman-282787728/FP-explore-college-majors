Some of friends got only 11 years old and grandmother bodies.",1385596800,,157,5.0
8229641,4,B000XSKDLU,"My husband and I saw the movie ""Teeth"" and decided that the cheaply made asian version must be good too. This movie was so much fun, But don't bother watching it if you have no sense of humor. The effects are bad, the acting is worse, which makes it a really fun watch. This movie could easily be rated as a soft core porn as there is a lot of sexual scenes in it, nothing too graphic though.",1316649600,,392,4.038461538461538
8229642,1,B000XSKDLU,"This flick's idea is nothing new so I expected some new imagination at work. Similar movie is ""Angst"" which is exactly what you expect--entertainment. Japanese cousin falls straight into sensorship  trap  where maximum nudity limited to top part. Yes, the movie about vagina dentata never shows any vagina, only dentata. I guess director hoped the audience eat anything. Not me.",1302825600,,378,5.283333333333333
8229643,4,B000XSKDLU,"A perverted buddy of mine recommended this sleazy, cheaply-made abomination to me.  All I can say is Wahooopak!  I think I enjoyed it more than he did.  This is soooo awesomely bad.

It's an hour's worth of hot, voluptous chicks getting exposed, exploited, fondled, ridden, and just blatantly showcased for your enjoyment.  I think there's a bit of a bloody plot tossed in here somewhere, but I can't remember.  My brain's still fuzzy.

Oh yeah, it's a subliminal statement about safe sex.  A chick is crotchally infected with a pretty nasty parasite.  It's more than just a toothed vagina, there's a slimy serpent nested down there in the holiest of holies.  It's ready to spread some nasty love.

This is a campy, bloody, sexy, insane good time.  The f/x are cheaply made plus the acting is pretty horrible.  But who cares?  It's a fun idea, plus there's plenty of hot naked chicks.  Turn your brain off and enjoy this guilty pleasure.",1239408000,8,937,4.732919254658385
8229644,3,B000XSKDLU,"A year before I saw the satirical horror flick, ""Teeth"" I saw a highly exploitive Japanese film called ""Killer P***y"" (aka. Kiseichuu: kiraa pushii); Sexual Parasite, its title cleaned out for U.S. audiences is a movie about ""vagina dentata"" (toothed vagina in Latin). Directed and written  by Takao Nakano, this film is totally exploitive, trashy, campy, silly and is just an excuse for hot Japanese women to show their stuff. For a movie like this, you have to totally turn off your brain and look at it from a comedic standpoint--this is NOT a film to be taken seriously and this review is not for the pedantic--certain words are necessary to visualize this film.

The beginning of the film begins a lot like Peter Jackson's ""Brain Dead"" when some years ago, during an expedition in the Botswana, group of explorers encounter a tribe with their witch doctor trying to free their biological find. The expedition goes awry when results in the infection of a female scientist, the organism had penetrated this gal`s goodies while she sat down. A few years after that fateful event, a group of teens who are in an adventure for sex, beer and rock and roll, stumble across an abandoned building. They find a lot of food, smutty magazines and liquor, and they decide to spend the night. They look forward to a night of drunken partying and unprotected sex, the girls waste no time in shedding their clothes. On the way to take a bath, one of the girls manages to accidentally find a chamber housing the frozen body of a naked woman (yes, the woman infected earlier) and she unwillingly wakes her up from her slumber. The sexual parasite is poised to kill everyone with their pants down! It's up to some hot chicks to fight off this perverse menace!

Honestly, this movie is bad, real bad--but it may well be the greatest movie about ""vagina dentata"" ever made. The film is campy, goofy and the story is pretty silly, with special effects that looks so cheap and unrealistic, but I have to admit, it was part of its trashy B-movie charm. The title may suggest something more sinister but viewers won't be able to take it as anything more than ""guilty fun"". The girls get naked quite often, and the female cast are sexy little creatures. The uncut version even has shots of semi-full frontal nudity. I say semi because the camera is at the very edge that you see enough but not too much and the camera pans over a plastic cover over a woman`s private area. Thankfully, there is no intentional ""fogging"" in the crotch areas (I hate those things). There are quite a lot of scenes of gratuitous sex, alien-like vaginal secretions, and the cinematography has a lot of womb-like sequences, from the inside and out.

Takao Nakano is definitely a master of Japanese sexploitation and he gets right to the point--he never pretends that this is a clever movie. He gives his audiences what they want; boobs, ""rubberized"" creatures, blood and gore. This is NOT a horror film but rather one that plays on the male anxiety for exploitive fun. Our mutated ""culprit"" or genital monster looks like a cross between an angry Aylmer and a mutated puppet with a lot of teeth. Views from the inside and the outside are fairly visible. Some devices in its narrative doesn't make sense, as there are aplenty of plot goofs and our ""vaginal based parasite"" can disembowel as well as castrate, and choke a girl by her own viscera--yes, it doesn't make sense. The movie is about perverted exploitation more than anything else. Actresses Sakurako Kaoru, Natsumi Mitsu, Sachika Uchiyama and Yumi Yoshisuki looked very comfortable in their roles, and they are nikkid most the time. The film also has the ever-popular scenes of male hand over the panty sequences as well as the massaging of slimy boobies.

Honestly, don't waste your time watching this but if any of my descriptions sound appealing then give it a shot. You may read more into the movie if you wish, and try to see some ""art house"" charm. For me, the movie is so bad that it is good. If you find the concept of a crotch monster hilarious and would like to see how the Japanese illustrates the most dangerous poon-tang in all of Japanese cinema with clichd horny teenagers as its victims then ""Sexual Parasite"" is for you. This film isn't anything complex but does what its supposed to do, a wanton 60 minute exercise in genre sexploitation. You should know what you're getting into.

Recommended? [3- Stars] had to give it props for its demented surprises.",1238716800,2,4486,4.701017811704834
8229645,2,B000XSKDLU,"**NOTE**
(Actual title is ""Killer @#$%&"")
The cover is double-sided and reversible.
So you can display it with either title.

OK I was expecting a gorier asian version of ""Teeth"" when I purchased this flick.
What I got was a cheaply-made,
haphazardly-construed, badly-acted, softcore asian porno.
I can't really say anything beyond that as this was the first flick I've ever found myself incapable of sitting through.
Maybe some day, I'll give it another go,
see if I missed any cool gore, or profound creature effects.
On the bright side, there were plenty of half-naked, asian chix.
A plus, but certainly not a selling point.
**You ever have one of those movies you were too embarrassed to even give away.
Yeah...........it's one of those.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
Aquiring an STD,
would be less painful,
than sitting through 20 minutes of this flick.",1217289600,3,849,4.93006993006993
8229646,5,B000XSKDLU,"Another brilliant excursion into genius with a deep jungle parasite going even deeper. Not quite as amazing or intense as the exorsisters series he did some years ago but on the other hand, this stars Sakurako Kaoru, so , you cant go wrong.",1214092800,2,240,4.604651162790698
