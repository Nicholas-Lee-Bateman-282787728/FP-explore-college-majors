5241265,5,B0091C22E0,"Well, I'm a little prejudiced since the Irish Rovers are my favorite band even with the changes in the lineup.  Jimmy Ferguson died in 97 and Will Millar left in 95.  George Millar (Will's younger brother) now fronts the band with an able assist from John Reynolds and Ian Millar. George's cousin, who replaced Joe.  This Christmas DVD is a follow up to their Home in Ireland DVD and is even better.  The concert scenes were taped in Chatam Ontario, and they have extras in Alberta.  John McDermott, an Irish Tenor, accompanied by Jason Fowler, is the guest star, and the DVD features a children's choir.  There is a Christmas edition of the song Lilly the Pink and a comic edition of the Unicorn, with John demonstrating how the song would have sounded if Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and Elvis had sung the Unicorn.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1353715200,3,841,4.604026845637584

5241284,5,B0091C22E0,"I love this DVD.  You don't need to be Irish or an Irish music fan to like this DVD.  I think it's something that anybody can enjoy.
It's fantastic entertainment for Christmas that you can watch over and over without tiring of it.
The Irish Rovers keep the show mostly light and lively with many fresh new songs perfect for Christmas.
When you're through looking at this DVD you feel happy and in the Christmas spirit.
I agree with another reviewer, the video is beautifully shot.  The concert venue, and scenery at Banff National Park are gorgeous.
I like that the video itelf is tasteful and calm and refrains from excessive cuts and manic zooming that plagues so many
concert videos.  A high-quality product.  Well done!
This one will be viewed many times every year.",1356220800,,770,4.674074074074074
