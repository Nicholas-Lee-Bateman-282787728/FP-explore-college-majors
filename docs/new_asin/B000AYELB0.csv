2397882,5,B000AYELB0,"I hope that maybe people can find this now on this website, as I found it by a fluke googleing...

This is a great instructional video, the first 30 minutes breaks down the excercises step by step, and then it gives you the flow of them at the end. I used the whole tape for a while, then just skipped to the 12 minute routine.  Now I know it, and can do it anywhere. What a great way to start the day if you don't have alot of time in the morning!  Enjoy!",1146873600,96,456,3.881720430107527
2397893,3,B000AYELB0,Nice if you want a 10 minute workout - which I did. They talk you through the moves but I'm not happy that they don't use mirror imaging - they use their left side instead of their right side when doing moves. They should use mirror imaging so the viewer does not have to think about it.,1496448000,,287,4.052631578947368

2397895,5,B000AYELB0,Great dvd. Easy to follow,1494633600,,25,4.2
2397896,5,B000AYELB0,I got this because I was hoping I might become consistent if I had the DVD. Not quite yet but this is very easy to follow and informative. It feels good and can be used by anyone at any ability. You know all you can do is get better at it and eventually will learn it by heart if you keep up with it. I wish they had more dvds with more exercises for variety. Hopefully they will.,1494460800,,380,3.8846153846153846
2397897,5,B000AYELB0,Easy to follow and enjoy.  There are two parts.  One broken down with instructions and the other where you can just do the entire sequence.  I would recommend it.,1494028800,2,162,4.517241379310345

2397901,5,B000AYELB0,I received this DVD yesterday and just finished watching it. The energy of this video is amazing. Daisy and Francesco's instructions are extremely clear and flow so gently with the postures. This takes place in a meadow with the Rocky Mtns in the background. I have had some health issues and have been trying to find a Qigong practice that would not stress my neck. I think this one will be perfect. Am looking forward to learning this practice and healing with it.,1486512000,2,466,4.626506024096385
2397902,4,B000AYELB0,This seems like a nice routine but it's a bit frustrating trying to get the moves correct.  The verbal instructions are sometimes out of sync with the video and also on the second meridian cleansing Daisy instructs to start with the left hand  rather than the right as she instructed in the first meridian cleansing but then she reverts to the instructions for the right hand.  I am confused as to whether I am to start and lead with the right the first time and then start and lead with the left the second time (which would seem to be a good idea to balance both sides) or if I am to do the second (ending) meridian cleansing identically to the first (starting) one.,1485388800,,668,4.370967741935484
2397913,4,B000AYELB0,I enjoyed their step by step walk through and then the actual continuous version.,1484524800,,81,4.857142857142857

2397916,5,B000AYELB0,This is the best video I've seen for instructing.  It is slow enough to be able to follow along and learn.  I watch it over and over until I know the moves by heart.,1479081600,,165,3.823529411764706

2397920,5,B000AYELB0,This is my second DVD by this couple and I find it very well done and informative. Having both a man and a woman is interesting because of our differences in approach.  The routine is challenging enough to not be boring and easy enough that you can work up to the degree of stretch needed. I would recommend this to anyone interested in Tai Chi or Qigong because the benefits are ongoing.,1471824000,,388,4.388888888888889
2397921,5,B000AYELB0,Excellent routine!,1470355200,,18,8.5
2397922,5,B000AYELB0,"I got this program to support a food cleanse I am doing for my liver and to get rid of my eczema once and for all. I was not sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with this program. I heard about Qigong on a radio show and decided to try it. I wanted something I could do right before bedtime that was pretty short and easy to do plus I wanted something to go along with a gentle cleanse I'm doing. This is perfect! It consists of two parts. One is a short interview which is worth watching and the other part is the Qigong exercises. It starts out with a slow version going through each exercise so you learn the moves. I believe there are eight moves to this whole thing and each move cleanses one of your organs. Then after the slow part, it immediately goes into the complete moves which takes about 8-9 minutes to complete in succession. You can ""skip"" forward on your remote to get to just the 8 minute program which I do now since I learned the moves. It is not hard at all to do and I find the moves very relaxing and soothing to do. I like how there is a couple (man and woman) who do the moves together since I do this with my husband. He feels its ok for a guy to do it because another guy is doing these moves I guess. So, if you really are doing this for cleansing, I would suggest doing a food cleanse as well to get the maximum benefits. Enjoy!",1469923200,16,1385,4.0583941605839415

I do not get sick from regular Qing DVD with doctor and master instructors.  These modification maybe wrong.

2397958,4,B000AYELB0,"I love the movements for cleansing.  Their Qi Gong for Cleansing  is very pleasant and easy for most people to accomplish, no matter what age and with few exceptions. The only reason why i didn't give the five stars is that half of it is devoted to yoga advertising before I could view the Qi Gong.  I would have preferred a discussion pertaining to cleansing.",1396828800,4,360,4.507692307692308
2397959,5,B000AYELB0,"I really enjoy the dvds by Francesco and Daisy. They are well choregraphed, well instructed and easy to follow for a beginner like myself. This routine is broken down into individual routines , then is combined into an uninterruped flow that can be done daily to clear energy flows in all the meridians fo the body. Once you have the basics down, you can skip ahead to the flow. It takes about 10 minutes, so is easily done morning and /or evening.  The setting and music are lovely as well.",1393977600,2,491,4.455555555555556

Apparently, it won't work on any of my computers because of it's not intended to be viewed in my country (U.S.). At least that's what the error says when I load it.  Now, I'm not sure if I can send it back, because the seal on the CD has been broken and opened.

The only posititve I can say is, I received it within a few days of placing the order.",1386547200,,451,3.776595744680851

 This  Is A Great Value For An Amazing Way Of Being, And Healing.  It Is A Great Meditative Practice.  Very Holistic.
I Look Forward To Purchasing All Of Their QiGong DVD's.  They Are Well Done.

2397964,4,B000AYELB0,"I love this DVD, however I thought it was a different DVD, because I bought the same one that had a different cover and a different title.  That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Also, after you go through the whole video, you really only need the last part on a daily basis, but I can't skip to that ending part where they go over the whole routine.  I wish I could skip to the  whole routine since I have already seen the ""lesson"" part.  Other than that, it is a very relaxing, soothing routine.",1385769600,4,503,4.040404040404041

When I get something going on this tape, I find the camera work a bit frantic--moving about a good bit on the two demonstrators and leaving me frequently checking to see if I am still using the correct leg or arm.  I feel like most of my exercise comes from flipping about like a windmill to readjust myself to stay in the correct position.  I think the content
is fine, just fine, but the product is problematic in these three areas:  1.)  DVD operation, 2.)Being able to easily follow changes in body positions, and 3.) lots of changes in camera angles and views.",1376524800,5,825,4.290322580645161

Calming, relaxing and health promoting.",1373068800,,318,4.7272727272727275
2397975,5,B000AYELB0,This video has several different exercises packed into one. It feels like you bought three or four videos with four different instructors and five exercises. My favorite is  the morning qigong with David Dorian Ross.  It is well worth your money.,1372032000,,246,4.975609756097561
2397976,5,B000AYELB0,"I love this workout.  I feel so refreshed and energized after doing it.  You may not buy into the theory of qigong:  the healthy flow of energy is vital to our well being.  However, you can benefit from this workout.  The beautiful mountain scenery, the gentle voices of Francesco and Daisy, the breathing focus and the gentle circular movements can't help but relax you.

In today's world, we are bombarded with toxins.  We have toxins from the air we breathe, toxins from the food we eat, and toxins from our negative emotions.  Is it any wonder that most of us are stressed and suffer from insomnia?  We all need release from these toxins.

I am an advanced exerciser who loves intense exercise.  I know I need to take rest days, but I like to do something on those days.  Qigong Detox is just the thing.  My blood gets moving, my joints feel looser and I feel relaxed.

I also love to use this DVD the morning after I've had a bad day eating-wise.  I have a wicked sweet tooth and sometimes it gets the best of me.  I feel so much better if I've done a detox workout like this one; I feel all the sugar is gone from my body.

There was one minor frustration with this workout:  there is no mirror cuing.  This was only an issue for a few of the more complex exercises, the liver cleansing and the stomach cleansing.  Thank goodness both Francesco and Daisy wear wedding rings on the left hands so I could more easily follow along.

I am new to Qigong, but I love it. Francesco and Daisy do a nice job of balancing instruction on the movements with an actual flow.  I especially enjoyed the transition moves between each section.

I highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to naturally feel more energized.",1365033600,11,1717,4.4326923076923075

We were cautioned in the fine print that the contents (video) may not be what the cover reflects.  Hmmm....",1363392000,4,336,4.370967741935484
2397979,5,B000AYELB0,"This is my first Qi Gong DVD ever and it is wonderful.  I have been using it for less than 2 weeks and the first thing I noticed was that after the first session I slept peacefully all night long.  After years of off and on insomnia, rarely staying asleep and spending hours just trying to fall asleep, this was a miracle for me.  Another thing I noticed was the pain in my liver area going right through to my back for the past 7 years (approx.) has been getting better every day since.  I also feel stronger, more balanced, centered and calmer.  I never miss a day of going through this routine even though I do it very imperfectly; I see this as a life-long practice.  I do the guided session as well as the regular routine.
I have tried Tai Chi, different kinds of Yoga, meditation and too many alternative healing methods to mention, but this one somehow felt like I have to include it in my life in order to feel better.  So, I highly recommend this DVD; I love Francesco Garripoli & Daisy Lee-Garripoli as they have soothing voices and a very calming presence, and the music is incredible.  Also, the scenery is in Colorado and ""out of this world"".  Enjoy!

It has a training session that is about 26 minutes or you can then choose to just go through the sequence without instruction that is about 13 minutes.

2397982,5,B000AYELB0,"I have several videos by these folks and I enjoy all of them. This form is shorter than most of the others, but then that allows it to be used when time is short such as in the morning before work. It is hard to say whether or not this video will work for you. The reason is that Qigong is as much about mental concentration and energetic discipline as physical movement. It is very possible to follow all the movements as one might do in a dance video and not get much from them. The idea is to get in touch with your body's energy, flow with it and feel it move. If that isn't your bag, simply going through the motions in hopes of feeling better may not work for you. Pilates or Yoga might be a better choice.",1357171200,4,712,4.056737588652482

2397987,4,B000AYELB0,"I just finished my first Qi Gong session ever and I really liked it. I have a Tai Chi video but could never get more than a few minutes into it, it is too much sitting down into the knees and not only uncomfortable but painful as well. I really liked this Qi Gong Cleansing dvd and I look forward to learning the movements so I can do it on my own. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I didn't realize until about halfway through that Daisy and Francesco didn't use the opposite arms and legs so that one could follow along like a mirror. Nearly all video workout instructors will use the opposite arm, leg or side so that the person watching the video can follow along like a mirror, which makes perfect sense when trying to learn new moves. Daisy and Francesco would say things like ""moving down your left leg"" because they were actually moving down their left leg but since I was following like a mirror I would be moving down my right leg. It really messed me up and make it harder to figure out the moves because I was too worried about if I was on the correct side. I tried standing sideways but that didn't work. I just had to focus on doing the opposite of whatever they were doing which was a challenge in itself without even considering learning the Qi Gong techniques. This dvd would have been 5 stars if they had made it easier to follow along. The breathing was also a bit tricky since they would be saying breath out as I was breathing in, I think that is more a matter of needing to take slow deep breaths and I apparently breath too fast and too shallow. I will keep using it and will hopefully learn it quickly enough so that I won't need the dvd anymore. That being said, Daisy and Francesco were enjoyable to watch and I would be interested watch another Qi Gong dvd by them. I also purchased a Qi Gong dvd by Lee Holden that I haven't tried yet so I really don't have anything them compare to until I do.",1335657600,3,1937,4.209677419354839

2397993,5,B000AYELB0,"Rarely are my experiences so positive or negative that I am compelled to write a review but, in the case of this wonderful DVD, I just think it deserves praise. I am brand new to Qi Gong. I get plenty of cardio through running and hiking and I work out in a gym with a trainer, but I was looking for something that would be grounding, relaxing and ""spiritual"", maybe even meditative. I've tried a few types of Yoga here and there but I don't like the sustained, uncomfortable positions and none of them were what I was looking for. Saw this DVD at Whole Foods. I am extremely happy with it.

Unlike most of the other reviewers, I haven't been doing it in the morning to start my day, although I'm sure that would be fabulous too. I throw it on the big screen TV in a quiet room by myself each night before I go to bed and I find it an incredible, beautiful way to complete my day and regroup.  I find the organ cleansing movements to be very soothing and  healing. The instructors are down-to-earth and relatable. I know a couple of reviewers mentioned feeling emotionally upset and borderline ill from the detox aspect of it. I've felt none of that; only soothed and peaceful from the first time I watched it.

After going through the routine with the very good step-by-step instruction for about 2 weeks, I now fast forward to where they go through it a second time in one flowing movement from organ to organ with no voice over and I do it along with them. I just about have it memorized where I could do it without the DVD but I like doing it along with them and the music makes me feel good. That part takes only about 10 min so it's easy to fit it in after a workout or any time really.

I've had a particularly stressful couple of months and was feeling a lot of anxiety. This DVD has made a real, noticeable difference in how I feel and I can't say that about anything I've ever done before. I don't know about other Qi Gong but this particular one I like because when I'm doing the organ cleansing I feel like I'm taking the time to care about myself, to slow down and be good to myself and grateful for my health and my life. I find myself smiling and just feeling grounded and secure.

With regard to the exercise aspect of it, this routine is certainly not a ""workout"". But I feel like there is some core strengthening, balancing and stretching involved and I do feel tighter and tauter when I'm finished doing it. But it's a great thing to wind down at the end of the day because it's not stimulating.

It was everything I was looking for; short, easy...and it really works.",1312502400,10,2587,4.288934426229508
2397994,3,B000AYELB0,"One of the problems i have with this workout is that its not very helpful when you are trying to find the beginning. You have to search through to get to the starting point. To get to the 10 minute part you have to surf through all the rest as well.

In addition, normal workouts are done as though you are looking into a mirror so the moves are easy to follow. However, with this one you have to re-orient. If the person is doing the move on his right side you can't mirror the moves, you have to mentally remind yourself to do it on your right side and not try to mirror the move. This particularly relates to the part with liver cleanse. You cannot make the movements for cleansing the liver on the wrong side of the body because it just would not work.

Apart from that its kinda relaxing but I can't say that it has had any significant impact.",1310860800,6,848,4.164634146341464
2397995,2,B000AYELB0,"I'm new to Qigong but after purchasing three or four other video's and beginning to ""get into it"" I thought this would be a nice addition. It is filmed nicely with a relaxing musical score and gentle narration however, I really REALLY dislike this routine especially as compared to others.

I should mention, I'm not especially into the ""energy"" so there is already a huge bias which I openly admit may make me less than an ideal reviewer for this. However, I also realize there are many people (such as myself) interested in Tai Chi and Qigong for the health benefits, gentle movements and flexibility. While this does provide some relief and movement it was far less than that of other video's. Much of the time I found myself very bored, the routine was tedious and the impact upon completion lacking. I did not find the physical relaxation or energetic response that I feel after completing other Qigong routines.

2397996,5,B000AYELB0,"The universe delivered this instruction to me at the perfect time. I was in need of intestinal clearing and over all balancing. Someone else mentioned frustration with the figure 8 instruction. They clearly state that the movement is lead by the pinky finger and that it is a figure 8 design. This instruction was good enough for me and I did find it difficult the first few days, but as my gut started to relax I have found that exercise much easier and more fluid in a natural way. (The body knows even when the logical mind gets in the way)

This is my first introduction to Qigong and I have thoroughly enjoyed this instruction and have seen marked results in less than a weeks time.

I did not worry if I was doing *it* correctly or breathing correctly and have found that my progression has gotten me closer to doing the complete set in a more fluidly with each day I practice.",1287878400,6,883,4.411042944785276
2397997,4,B000AYELB0,"I have tried a few different forms of Qi Gong and have been practicing daily for well over a year. I have Mathew Cohen's fire/water DVD and the Garripoli's beginner's DVD and have researched some other forms and have Roger Janke's book. Those routines are all good in moving Qi around but none of them have had the effect on my quality of life as this routine did. I have had problems sleeping most of my life - not sleeping deeply enough and never feeling rested in the morning no matter how much I slept. I tried dozens of supplements - all the B vitamins, vit D, Sam-e, fish oil, etc and many others and had some minor improvement but the situation was largely unchanged. I tired all kinds of sleep aids, melatonin, valerian, chamomile, passionflower, theanine, I went to a couple of doctors and they offered sleeping pills and various meds but nothing seemed to effect daytime energy and I rarely woke up feeling rested.

I was doing other Qi Gong routines consistently but had a breakthrough with this one. After about 3 weeks with this routine in the morning (along with most of the forms from Mathew Cohen's Fire/Water routine at night) I noticed a dramatic difference in quality of sleep. For the first time in as long as I can remember, I am falling asleep quicker and waking up much more rested. It doesn't take me 4 hours to get into my day and feel alert (only to slump in the late afternoon/early eve) I have more energy. My head is clearer right when I wake up, I have better focus, am more interested in things, more tuned in to life. The change is really incredible. Everything FEELS different. Life is more vivid and has more color. I recently had an eye exam and learned my vision improved for the first time in my life! My hearing is sharper and everything is more detailed.

While every move on this DVD is great and does something different and aids a different bodily system - the hemisphere balancing move has been literally a turning point for me. It does something in the way it moves Qi from the lower Dan Tien to the crown of the head, along with balancing right and left which you can literally feel while doing the move. It is one of the centerpieces to my routine and I do that twice a day. The other moves on this DVD are essential as well - particularly, the lung and heart clearing moves, and the liver and gallbladder clearing moves. The kidney move in this routine is not as effective as ""swings"" which is common to many forms of qi gong (where you twist and let the hands loosely slap the body on front and back) which aids just about every bodily system. Swings or (ringing the bell as it is sometimes called) is amazing for the spine, and gets rid of stagnant qi in the organs.

Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD. The other Garripoli DVD which is 3-4 times as long is nowhere near as effective. ""Wuji Qi gong"" which is the essence of that routine is more a collection of interesting and fun arm movements that are meant as an introduction to Qi Gong but is not a full body cleansing or Qi moving/generating system. What I learned in this journey is that not all Qi Gong routines are equal. There are some essential movements which should be part of every routine and are common to many systems. The reason for that is that they work. Length of time and intensity does not substitute for quality and you have to experiment and find what works for your particular health issues.

Note: the reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because they did not explain how to integrate breathing with these movements which is essential. I figured it out on my own through experimentation but that is a big omission. They also move far too fast to integrate effective breathing in their illustration of the routine as a continuous sequence after the instructional part. Regardless, if you buy no other Qi gong DVD, I would recommend buying this one.",1286496000,84,3876,4.470338983050848

So on the last replacement, I got the bright idea to try it in my computer (yeah, I'm actually that slow...) and it works just fine.  It's very strange, because the DVD player will play the ""interview"" portion, but not the ""program"" portion, where they teach the movements.

With all that said, I really like this Qigong for Detox title, as I am going through a medical problem that has required a lot of cleansing and ""detox.""

If you find it boring, don't despair, you may just need a different set of exercises that reasonate with you, there are many...just look around.
I will give you a word of advice that my master gave me when starting....learn the moves first...THEN learn how to breathe with them.  It's very difficult to do both at the same time when learning.  You may find as I did, once you know the moves the breathing follows naturally.
When done with intent, I find afterwards I am relaxed and energised...I can feel the energy coursing throughout my body...some reviewers describe as a tingling.

2398008,3,B000AYELB0,"I wasn't sure really how to rate this product because bottom line, it IS working!  How do I know?  I am not feeling so great, first off.  It's like when you get a massage, they tell you to drink lots of water because toxins are released and if you don't you could feel a little queasy.  I guess going through any sort of detox isn't going to be a fun experience.  I just think they should have addressed the effects the exercises might have on a person somewhere on the DVD...at least mention it!  At first I thought I might have a slight case of the flu or maybe ate something bad.

Not only am I feeling yucky physically, but it seems as if I am detoxing mentally as well.  The morning after my first time using the DVD, I had a small nervous breakdown and all sorts of feelings and thoughts I didn't realize I was having came to the surface.  Problem is, I'm not sure what to do with them now!  They are not necessarily good!  Would have been nice to have some advice on this on the DVD.

I got up at 4 o'clock in the morning to go to the bathroom.  My BM (bowel movement) was hot, sort of burning.  I researched it and read that this indicates release of toxins.  Again, that would have been good to know up front!  I think my body is in a highly toxic stage so I may practice every other day for a while to give my body a day for recuperation in between.

So, bottom line is YES, it does work.  But be advised that there are ill effects you will be suffering through.  And when you start to feel icky, it's time to chug some water because your body is about to get rid of some stuff and the water will help to flush it out.  Otherwise, you might feel icky for some time.  The exercises are easy but the aftermath is not!",1252108800,60,1725,4.074404761904762

Is it vertical, horizontal, on an angle?  When do the palms face inward and when do the face outward?  The movement is done fairly quickly.  Rather than performing it slow so you get the movement, they burn right through it and blame ""intestinal problems"" if you don't get it.  No, it's bad teaching for that one movement.  The instructors should have clarified and taught that differently. A good teacher teaches they don't just say, ""Oh, do like this"" with no other explanation.

Unlike other fitness DVDs where unrealistic expectations are instilled by hyperactive instructors, the level-headed, measured approach here is much to be welcomed.

Fine scenery sets the backdrop to the movements which have been sensitively filmed.  The director has resisted the temptation to cut in to close-ups which only disorient the viewer and has instead gone for sweeping tilts and tracks at a wide-enough shot size to encompass the movement.  The music is restful without being trite.

The form itself is made up of moves which been creatively put together by the Garripolis themselves.  I was left feeling calmed and uplifted by their scope.

I did some research on google and came across Qi Gong and but really didn't know much about it so I did some more research and read the reviews on Amazon on different dvd's.

I was a little apprehensive at first but it was the best investment I've made. I love this video, it was perfect pace for someone who is not patient, Garri guides you through every step keeping you on track of breathing and moving correctly. I just finished my first session and it was energizing, peaceful and relaxing. The quality of video was excellent, learning the excersizes are extremely easy to follow, and I would recommend this to everyone. Someone said in the reviews here that they would just recommend this to beginners. I don't believe that. If you truly get what Garri is saying, it's all about the mind, body, soul...chi so I think it's for anyone and all the time. Moves do not have to complicated or advanced for this to work...in my opinion. I have nothing but praise for this video and will return with next review in a few months to let you all know the changes it's had on my life. The only thing I would say if anything is if the music could be just a little louder. Lastly, the documentary was just amazing and almost felt like National Geographic!!! Garri's interview was uplifting and inspiring...thank you for this gift.",1212192000,23,1582,4.474048442906574

Thank you for the gift,

2398022,5,B000AYELB0,"Recvd CD in timely fashion and in perfect condition.  Have not had a chance to try it out yet, but am looking forward to doing it.",1202601600,,130,4.0
2398029,5,B000AYELB0,I've had trouble dedicating enough time to my Qigong exercises to do me much good but this workout right here is perfect.  It take about 20 minutes to go through all the movements one by one to learn them and then they do 1 fluid exercise using all of the movements which only takes about 10 minutes.  This is perfect for those on the go who don't always have time for a full Qigong session.,1202428800,13,391,4.2
2398030,3,B000AYELB0,"Although this DVD is entitled ""QiGong for Cleansing,"" I was under the assumption that it would include the QiGong 6 Healing Sounds. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It just goes through a series of slow (quite boring) movements. This type of qigong may work for someone else, but it was not the qigong form I was looking for. I ended up selling back.",1200614400,12,344,4.655737704918033
2398031,5,B000AYELB0,"I got this DVD and have not been disappointed.  I had to do the whole learning video at first, but now I just fast forward to the last chapter where they do the whole set of movements in a routine.

It is easy to follow, and easy to get up every morning and do first thing. Since the routine only takes about 10 minutes, there is no room for excuses!

The only suggestion I would have to make this video better is to either show where you breathe in and out, or for the instructors (at least one of them) to do like an exaggerated breathing.  After a week, the breathing makes more sense and is easier, but it would be nice to have that reminder.

All in all, I am extremely pleased with this DVD and would recommend it highly.",1197072000,17,727,4.127659574468085
2398032,5,B000AYELB0,"This is an exceptionally well done DVD, well thought out and organized to teach the beginner in Qigong (like me). Done in a beautiful setting with the mountains as a background, I was quite pleased with the instruction.  Only suggestion for improvement, the volume was a little low, I could barely hear it on my laptop.  But this is a minor point.",1195516800,7,347,4.580645161290323
2398033,5,B000AYELB0,"I got this DVD a few weeks ago, and began learning the 13-move routine along with the DVD. It took me a few times to be able to do it on my own, and now I do it every morning. Takes about 10 minutes or a little less. Fun to do, wakes me up, I feel better after I do it. This was definitely worth the money. I recommend it!",1176249600,35,322,3.6142857142857143
2398034,5,B000AYELB0,"I bought this DVD last year and it has been such a great asset.

I will help you balance your energies in a gentle and quick way.  As explained by other reviewers, it teaches you the routine step by step and then goes on to the full routine, which is only about 12-15 minutes long.  It's background is peaceful and serene with beautiful music.

Once you have learned the steps, those 15 minutes will be the best spent in your day!

If you would like to be more balanced and energetic, then this is the right choice.",1175731200,38,515,4.268041237113402
2398035,5,B000AYELB0,"I highly recommend this DVD.  The 2 practioners are soft spoken and very sincere.  During the first half of the program they do the movements very slow and explain everything in detail, how to breathe, etc. so it's like a moving meditation.  The excersises bring awareness to different parts of your body without straining them.  The 2nd half is a 12 minute workout which is wonderful.  I've had great results from using this program, feel a difference in my life, and definitely, more CHI.

  They should probably have called it Qi Gong for Healing, not ""cleansing"" which is probably confusing.",1173744000,45,595,4.88
2398036,5,B000AYELB0,I'm new to the practice of QiGong..this DVD provides a powerful insight to its practice and depth of purpose.  It is easy to follow and quickly absorbs one in the flow of using QiGong in one's life.  It connects the innerspirit with a physical healing presence.,1163203200,12,261,4.6521739130434785
2398037,5,B000AYELB0,"I own several Qi Gong dvds & enjoyed most of them. I already have the Garripoli's Qi Gong for beginners which is about 50 min & felt great. Just like the other, Francessco & Daisy (cover) do this outside, with each of them taking turns doing the voice over narrations. The music is kind of Asian influence, soft, simple, relaxed/soothing type. It starts with the teaching portion lasting 28 min, with them telling you what to picture, what organs it helps, hand/feet placement, & when to breathe in/out. The last 10 min is them doing the entire sequence over smoothly w/the music louder & no narration.
The only quibble I have is I noticed on their other one, but more so on this, is they tell you when to breathe after the fact instead of just right before or during, even though you will be repeating it 2-3x knowing when to breathe.
I was jittery before I started this, but felt more relaxed after. this is a great short way to increase your energy for anyone.
Qi gong is for anyone & it easily can be modified for those who have joint or muscle limitations. The point is to learn to breathe more deep, stretch & move, be aware of your body & cultivate/increase your constitutional energy.",1156464000,184,1192,4.497695852534562
2398038,5,B000AYELB0,"This is a fantastic DVD. I am new to Qi Gong and this DVD was very easy for me to follow. I have arthritis in my upper and lower spine, neck and both hips. I was able to follow everything and my entire body had no pain during the DVD and for four hours after I was finished. The day after I first did Qi Gong with this Detox DVD. My body got rid of many toxins, both physical and mental. A must have in your collection.",1154736000,96,419,3.8275862068965516

8080860,2,B000AYELB0,"I recently heard about Qigong and thought I would try it to see if it would help with my lymphedema.  I bought 5 DVD' s and two books.  Of all the items I bought, this is my least favorite.
The first thing I don't like was that it has two people, Daisy and Francesco, demonstrating the moves.  I didn't know which one to watch.  They were standing too close to each other and whenever they did arm movements I kept expecting them to hit. I think they actually did touch one time.
After watching for a little while, I realized that Daisy seems to be the more experienced.  She was focused and her moves were smooth and graceful.  Also, her voice is more pleasant.  Francesco seemed kind of...clunky is the word that comes to my mind. Also, he didn't seem to be focused.  A few times he would turn his head to look at Daisy.  Just me, but I didn't like him.
Another problem I have with this DVD is that it is not in mirror image.  In some moves that's okay, but in the moves where they say put left hand in a certain place and right hand in another place, I got confused.
I really like the other DVD's I bought, so I'm not sure if I will use this one very much, if at all.",1500595200,,1170,4.092105263157895
