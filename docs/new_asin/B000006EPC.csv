It's not as though I was given ample time, this performance was only thirty minutes long in duration. I don't recommend this DVD to anyone.",1303084800,,261,4.695652173913044

8191375,5,B000006EPC,"on my way flying home to germany my girlfriend told me to find a funny film for us to watch. The title said it all, and i was fooled..... this has to be the funniest,sickest and most intriguingly bizarre film ever made; the concepts involved are beyond all diseased imagining.everyone has seen films that their friends swore would have them clueless as to what happens next but this one is the daddyman. Christopher Lee is the only actor in the film I have ever seen before.( or since come to that)  There is gut wrenching cruelty mixed with bedlam humour of a type particularly suited to the english psyche, encompassing what one strives to explain on holiday as  ""british humour"", i.e dark and twisted enough to tickle our subliminal humour valve,but too dark and over the heads of johnny foreigner.  to whit:  if i had explain,you wouldn't understand. I mean,seriously, i had to watch it three or four times to understand it myself.  you will never,ever find a film quite this mental anywhere,anywhen.",995932800,2,1004,4.780346820809249
