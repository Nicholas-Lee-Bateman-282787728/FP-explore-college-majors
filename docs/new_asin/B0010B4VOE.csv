Anyone with an interest in this sport should buy several different videos of his which show, first hand, what it is like. This comment comes from a Jumpmaster with many years of experience and very familiar with his work.",1476748800,,319,4.389830508474576
8530292,5,B0010B4VOE,"The most artistic skydiving video ever made, beautiful and spectacular shots, good soundtrack
Most parts are shot in 35mm format, that gives an awsome picture quality, unlike mini DV.
A must have for all people interested in, or practicing skydiving",1227139200,,249,5.25
