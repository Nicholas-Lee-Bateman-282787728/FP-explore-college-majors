8616909,5,B00FMGPVUG,I love anything Jack Hanna does.  He has an interesting humor and he is so sensitive to the treatment and conservation of wildlife.  He and Steve Irwin will always hold a special place in my heart.,1446595200,,197,4.444444444444445

8616912,2,B00FMGPVUG,"Jack Hanna's show 'Into the Wild' has a very misleading title.. it should be called something like '5 star eco-tourism for rich people'.. there is no point in any episode where I would consider him actually going 'into the wild'.. its just him and his wife staying in hotels/lodges and going on pathetic 'eco adventures' like zip lining, taking short guided nature walks around the lodge or visiting wild animal rehabilitation facilities.. the show is boring.. he seems like a nice guy and I know he's accomplished a lot in his career but I don't understand how this show is still on the air",1387584000,2,591,4.6923076923076925
