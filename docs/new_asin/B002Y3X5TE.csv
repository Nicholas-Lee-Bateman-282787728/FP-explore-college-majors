8384033,5,B002Y3X5TE,"The Pecos in earlier times was a challenging river; its history a colorful pageantry of American Indians, emigrant wagon trains, stagecoaches, outlaws and cattle drives. This tape vividly recounts some of that history;old pictures and old-timers' reminiscences expertly inter-cut with scenes of the river as it is today. For those who know the Pecos, it provides a nostalgic hour of homecoming. For those who do not, it is a splendid introduction to a vital part of the Western Texas Heritage."" Elmer Kelton, award-winning western author.

Charles Goodnight called the Pecos ""the graveyard of the cowman's hopes,"" others even compared it to hell. Like its most-dreaded ford, Horsehead Crossing, it flowed bloody, while in its currents, history merged with legend. Out of the river's banks grew the mythical Old West, where the whoosh of arrows meant Comanches, the thunder of hooves warned of stampedes, the blast of six-shooters signaled gunfights and the strike of prospectors' picks hinted at buried treasure.

It all happened on the Pecos; the stories and the mystery are here to watch and experience with your hosts, Patrick Dearen, author of Castle Gap and The Pecos Frontier and Portraits of the Pecos, and Mike Cox, author of five Texas-related books and Texana columnist for the Austin American-Statesman. The program was filmed by award-winning documentary producer Glen Sample Ely.",1288396800,2,1392,5.322727272727272
