8357687,5,B0029BT2A2,"Very engrossing silent movie and a good vehicle for its stars.  Had wanted to see the legendary Barbara LaMarr (""The Girl Who Was Too Beautiful"") in an early role and here she is.  Plot is wild and easy to follow.  Title sounds much more salacious than the story delivers, which is not a problem.  We will watch it again.",1521417600,,321,4.389830508474576
8357688,5,B0029BT2A2,A very early silent with an excellent script makes this film a true cinema experience.  Good film is good film no mater what era it comes from.  I highly recomend this film to anyone who is an open film lover.,1515456000,,209,4.2

8357690,5,B0029BT2A2,"This is an excellent film in good shape for its age. Considering it was thought to be a lost film, it looks very good. Arrived earlier than expected.",1391558400,2,149,4.357142857142857
8357691,4,B0029BT2A2,"The title suggests a Hollywood expos, but it's really a charming valentine, following Remember ""Mem"" Steddon's arc from runaway bride to Big Star. Great mix of melodrama & comedy doesn't take itself too seriously; the intertitles are often hilariously snide. Peppered w/ wonderful scenes of real directors directing real movies like GREED & A WOMAN OF PARIS. Director Rupert is Howard's uncle. 8/10",1313712000,5,398,5.333333333333333
8357692,4,B0029BT2A2,"This movie was forgotten and lost and discovered at again. Like the other Warner Archive DVD's its in good condition.

It's very enjoyable and movie-historical -interesting (for today) in any points:

This film offers behind-the-scenes footage of two legendary silent era director/performers at work: Charles Chaplin directing his comedy-drama _Woman of Paris, A (1923)_ and Erich von Stroheim directing Greed (1924)

A large number of the credited (in AFI and elsewhere) ""celebrities"" do not appear in the surviving version shown on Turner Classic Movies. They include: Hugo Ballin, Mabel Ballin, Robert Edeson, Claude Gillingwater, Dagmar Godowsky, Elaine Hammerstein, Alice Lake, Bessie Love, Patsy Ruth Miller, Anna Q. Nilsson, Milton Sills, Anita Stewart, Blanche Sweet, Florence Vidor, King Vidor, Johnny Walker and George Walsh

Many Hollywood ""behind the scenes"" actions are shown, including Marshall Neilan directing ""The Eternal Three""; and Fred Niblo directing ""The Famous Mrs. Fair."" Both of these movies appear lost, so this may be the only extant footage of them.

One of the celebrity actors credited on screen and appearing in a group is ""K.C.B.,"" but one may only speculate who that may be.

William Haines (23 years old!): this is his 3rd movie appearance and his first bigger role as Pinkey - Assistant Director.",1276992000,11,1331,5.405797101449275
8357693,3,B0029BT2A2,"""Souls for Sale(1923)"" was a lost, forgotten film for a long time. It's quite a juvenile story of a young woman lost in Hollywood with a creep husband(Eleanor Boardman and Lew Cody).  But this is well worth seeing for anyone interested in old Hollywood history. Included are scenes of Erich von Stroheim filming ""Greed"" at MGM studios(a year before it became MGM), and Charile Chaplin filming ""A Woman of Paris"". This movie flopped because it had no scenes with Charlie Chaplin. You also see snippits of directors Fred Niblo and Marshall Neilan. ""Souls for Sale"" co-stars the very lovely Barbara LaMarr, the first big star to die from drug-related problems. Married several times, and an all-night party-girl, LaMarr's career soared based on her vampish beauty. She retired to Europe. In poor health, she died in 1926, after completing 30 films. She was 29 years old.",1243036800,13,867,4.979310344827586
