5868043,5,B00DY6F9DK,This DVD really is great for people with arthritis. I am enjoying doing it and have started seeing some improvement with joint pain.,1393804800,,132,4.782608695652174
5868044,3,B00DY6F9DK,"A nice yoga DVD, but still somewhat strenuous. Emphasis on ""downward dog"" a pose that takes strength and practice to master. The chair modification for the pose is difficult, and I'm not sure gives the benefits that the pose offers. Sun salutation is great if you can accomplish it. I can't. I ended up doing little, and the modifications seemed like a waste of time.

The Meditation portion is valuable and can be performed on its own.",1392940800,7,436,4.662337662337662
5868045,5,B00DY6F9DK,I love this disc. It give very good instruction. It gives alternatives for different joints for each pose so it does not irritate it.,1392768000,4,133,4.583333333333333
5868046,3,B00DY6F9DK,Wish there was a segment that was a full workout without the explanations. I really liked how each problem area was addressed.,1392249600,17,126,4.7727272727272725
5868047,5,B00DY6F9DK,"This video is everything I hoped it would be. I would be able to modify every position every day if I needed to. I recommend this video for ANYONE (of any age) who has pain for any reason whether it be from disease or accident or age. Although there is pain I find that I am still able to benefit from yoga. This video covers everything you would want/need to know before hand and there's even a tutorial for the Sun Salutation.
I'm thankful I bought this. You will be too.",1392076800,4,473,4.208791208791209
5868048,4,B00DY6F9DK,"I really enjoyed the easy simple way Steffany Moonaz explained the poses verbally, slowly, and gave multiple versions of how to perform the postures.  It was just like being in her class.  I gave it a four star as I had to stop as some of the poses were causing pain in my back even doing it easily.  But that wasn't because the postures were too much for someone with no back problems, I just have a bad back and I bought it thinking I could do it.  She repeatedly tells you to do no harm but my back is just too bad.  If you don't have back problems then it's a great DVD!  I love the warm-up and relaxation in the end. Very easy DVD.  I've had to move on to simpler poses on my own.",1389052800,35,685,3.9562043795620436
5868049,5,B00DY6F9DK,"First off let me say that this DVD is more than just for those with arthritis. It is gentle enough for varying health issues while still maintaining a strengthening, well rounded and balanced practice. This DVD is an excellent source for any level practitioner - beginner, intermediate or experienced - it has clearly been carefully & expertly thought out & executed. Steffany Moonaz is very concise, perceptive and empathetic in her teaching - transitioning all poses in a smooth, fluid and comfortable manner. Comprehensive, complete, thorough, addressing all the different situations one may face with arthritic joints or with other health challenges - with clear instruction on how to modify every pose - one of the best Yoga DVD's I have ever purchased. What I have learned here I will be bringing to the mat and sharing with other's in my teachings. Thank you Steffany Moonaz and Arthritis Foundation for such an extensive and far-reaching DVD.

5868110,2,B00DY6F9DK,"It was very good at explaining things and breaking things down but as suspected it was not the ""work-out"" I was hoping for. this may be better suited for someone who has never really exercised before or for when an arthritic person is in the midst of a ""flare"".",1438300800,3,261,4.346938775510204

5868115,2,B00DY6F9DK,"I was disappointed that I had to open the package and read the disclaimers that this is not intended for those who have had joint replacements. Instead, they recommend Chair Yoga. Well, with my two hip replacements, I have trouble getting onto the floor, and I can't do extreme postures, but I'm certainly not limited to chair exercises only. I can follow these exercises to a certain extent, but I'm really annoyed that the disclaimer wasn't described more clearly.",1426896000,11,466,4.9113924050632916

5868153,5,B00DY6F9DK,"The routine is easy to follow. There are thorough instructions and there's even a section with frequently asked questions. Although it is best to go to an in-person class with a qualified yoga instructor, this is great to use at home to supplement your practice or for those who don't have the means to see a yoga instructor in person.",1400716800,2,335,4.6

5868158,5,B00DY6F9DK,"This is a fabulous DVD.  There's a perception that yoga is only for the young and lithe, but yoga is very therapeutic for those with arthritis or general joint stiffness.  To make yoga accessible to such people, this DVD demonstrates many modifications or assists for standard poses, modifications and assists that have been developed in collaboration with doctors.  Everything is explained in detail, and as a yoga teacher this type of information is invaluable, to help me deal with students who come in with these types of problems.  Great job, Steffany Moonaz!",1395187200,18,564,5.0978260869565215
5868159,5,B00DY6F9DK,I am taking up Yoga as one of many sources of exercise for my osteo arthritis and osteopenia.  It is a very step by step instruction video and it has lots of yoga poses suitable for the beginner and even advanced.  I like it because the positions are what I was looking for but not to the point where they have me standing on my head.  I would recommend it especially for beginners and those that have slight disabilities and still want to do yoga.  Buy it!!!,1394150400,2,459,4.241379310344827

8598974,3,B00DY6F9DK,It's okay. I need a faster-paced workout regimen but having arthritis sometimes it's difficult. This is a very slow paced workout video and it doesn't keep me interested.,1466640000,,170,5.107142857142857

8598979,2,B00DY6F9DK,"Spouse and I tried to do this DVD today for the first time. We are not new to yoga. Since this DVD is aimed at people with arthritis or joint issues or other ""issues"" as the introduction says, we figured it would be very gentle and good for days when we want a gentle practice. We watched the segment billed as the sun salutation instruction, but it was not instruction at all; it was the leader, Ms. Moonaz, demonstrating very rapidly without any transition or preparation. Plus, the series is quite different from the usual sun salutation process. Then when she actually leads the sun salutation, it is done so rapidly - with up and down/on and off the floor (for arthritis and other physical issues?) - and again, moving through the series with transition or preparation or even a slight slowing of the series to allow for getting into positions, it was just absurd. I can't believe all the positive reviews, nor that this comes from the ""arthritis foundation!""  We didn't even finish the sun salutation; there was no point. This is a very rigorous practice - and even the modification for knees that we watched was not much modification. The various ""modification for"" segments are long and slow and take a long time to watch, but then when trying the actual practice - it's fast, up and down, hurry up!  I wish I had not ordered it - at something like $25.00 this is an outrageously misleading product. We're not even  ""impaired"" but we found it much to fast-paced and rigorous, just in the basic sun salutation alone, so I can't imagine anyone with physical impairments being able to comfortably do this.",1444003200,38,1610,4.661971830985915
8598980,5,B00DY6F9DK,"Dr Steffany Moonaz's Arthritis-friendly yoga is an excellent DVD and one of the best I have seen . The postures are explained very clearly and the team members show different ways of doing the postures to accommodate various constraints that individuals may have. Steffany reminds everyone during the exercises that one should pay attention to one's own body and not to do overdo any posture that might hurt or cause pain. I really like the pace of the exercises as well as the focus on all parts of the body to provide a holistic exercise. The exercises followed by relaxation and meditation provide a wonderful experience and the importance of breathing is mentioned repeatedly. I have been using this DVD almost on a daily basis for a couple of years and have found marked improvement in my own flexibility and strength. I would strongly recommend this DVD not just to those that have arthritis, but anyone who wants a well designed program with clear explanation of each step while recognizing the different individuals may have different physical constraints and limits on flexibility.

8598981,5,B00DY6F9DK,I am so happy with this purchase.  I have osteoarthritis in my hands and have flare ups of inflammatory arthritis in most of my other joints. The workout is easy to do without skimping on the benefits of yoga. It is easy to modify to fit your needs.,1439078400,2,249,4.1875
