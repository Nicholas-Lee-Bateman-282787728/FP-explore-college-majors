6266882,5,B00IJZMZW4,"The production values were consistently good, so it was easy on the eyes and ears. The plot was a nice re-work of the gum shoe detective, if a little obvious. But this movie had what so few ""genre"" movies had, ""likeability"" and a good sense of fun.

It had just the right amount of tense moments and a quite a few gags ( I won't give them away) that were subtle but genuinely funny.

I liked the lead actors, especially the ""forced into it"" detective who is black without it being a ""special issue"", he just is, and not in any predefined way. I found myself rooting for him though out the entire movie, and relating to him, which is rare in movies or tv these days, (I am not African American, disclosure) because he has a heart in a city of tin men (another favorite theme of classic detective stories)!

I am usually down on endless Hollywood sequels, but this is one movie that I would like to see another one of.

6266884,2,B00IJZMZW4,"Hot Guys With Guns is yet another gay film that disappointed me. There is very little action (of both the sexual and violent variety), and there isn't even much camp.

6266902,3,B00IJZMZW4,"Gay murder mystery romantic comedy; heavy on the romance (not so good), no real comedy.  The acting was good and believable, but there were too many gay stereotypes for me. The part of the mother was supposed to be comic relief,  but she just came off as cartoon. There just wasn't enough funny/comedy for me.  The stereotypical falling apart when things got difficult was neither necessary or funny.  The PI instructor was a good plot device,  but wasn't developed enough. The PI should have been the much needed comedy. His bitching at the end should have come earlier and been funnier instead of annoying. It seems obvious that this was supposed to be the first of a series of movies, but I don't think it will happen. That's a shame because this was a good (not great) movie compared to the other gay themed stuff being released.",1444694400,,833,4.639455782312925

6266916,4,B00IJZMZW4,"At first, the film seems to have trouble finding its tone/genre - the opening credits scream James Bond, a couple of scenes in, it goes noir.  In the scheme of things, it is a small complaint.

Production values are great - what a nice change for an indie film.

How often does a gay film have an African American leading man?  Not often enough.  Even better, the film does not ignore his being Black, but also does not make it a theme.

Biggest challenge plot wise is that we never get to see what our 'detective' sees in his ex - he is shallow, self-centered, hedonistic.  Cute, yes, but not worth pining over.

The relationship of the two lead characters is complicated and, while not leading to any kind of predictable ending, it is deliciously enjoyable. I have to say, that the plot is a bit disjointed, in the end, but there is so much great stuff in this movie  that I have no trouble giving it high recommendation. The director takes some great cutaways  that remind me of some of the best of, """"Family  Guy,"" and the occasional nudity (there is plenty as we get toward the end) is done with a slapstick, continued sense of a good time had by all.  To begin, have an actor who, in studying for a part as a detective, finds himself curious about a real life murder and ends up doing some genuine detective work. He is joined by his, can't-keep-his-pants-on...""boyfriend (?)"". Part of the joy of this movie is how we are kept wondering as to what really is the nature of their relationship, and , it seems, that the nature of their connection keeps them confused right along with the audience.. The leads are both handsome and atypical of the kind of men we are accustomed to seeing in gay cinema; they are just, ""guys,"" There is a third character here who is worth talking about:: the actor's gun-shooting coach, an older, tough-as-nails crank who gets drawn into the case even as he is comically confused and mystified by the behavior of gay men.

The 2 leads play so well off each other. the teacher....love him and his remarks too. Are we sure he isn't......... I won't get into the plot because it would be too easy to give something away. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 for the sheer entertainment? if you don't figure it out....you are out of MY detective agency (I don't really have one but, well, ya know, for effect)  and the abysmal performances by quite a few others, particularly the mother, why was she even in this?

6266943,5,B00IJZMZW4,"This movie was a delight from start to finish.  It is a parody of private investigator movies, with a love interest thrown in. It reminded me of Nadine, another delightful movie.  The two main characters, and the PI teacher, are great fun, and thoroughly believable.  Danny loves Pip, who is a slut but who also loves Danny, though they weren't able to remain lovers seemingly in part due to Pip's mother (who is bizarre, but becomes understandable).  The movie was very thoughtful, and effortlessly, in a few seconds sometimes, answered small questions you had about the characters.  The gruff PI was funny, and his macho teacherliness was fun to watch in response to the two straight-acting but sometimes gay-seeming gay guys. The tension between the two leads was believable and entertaining, and moving at times; Pip's celebration of enjoyable sex and Danny's heartfelt mix of love, anger and betrayal toward Pip were an interesting mix intellectually and emotionally.  It was fun from start to finish. If you like mysteries and romance, you'll enjoy this film.",1414540800,,1065,5.057142857142857
6266944,5,B00IJZMZW4,"Just finished watching ""Hot Guys With Guns"" released by Wolfe Video.
Writer/Director Doug Spearman has created a fast-paced, witty, and insightful mystery comedy that not only takes off the rose colored glasses at how Hollywood operates; but also takes an honest look at why some relationships are doomed to failure despite the feelings of the people involved.
Though a spoof of the private investigator genre, ""Hot Guys With Guns"" has an intriguing mystery at its core.  Unknown persons are drugging participants of the sex parties of closeted Hollywood directors/actors and robbing them blind.
Party boy Phillip [Pip] Armstrong was a victim of one of these parties.  Instead of turning to the police, Pip turns to his ex-registered domestic partner and struggling but classically trained actor Danny Lohman who borrowed the $2,500 from Pip in order to take a class to obtain a PI license so that he can win the part of a disgraced PI on a Law and Order type show.
Pip will forgive the loan if Danny agrees to take the case; which Danny reluctantly does.
Throw in Pip's alcholoic mother, and Jimmy Peppicelli, a retired PI who is teaching the class Danny is taking and making straight As in and the comedy keeps rolling down unexpected avenues.
PRUDE Alert:  No real nudity worth mentioning, but it does exist in this movie.
Now I'm almost reluctant to mention this; but I'm going to go ahead anyways because I literally fell off my couch when I head this in the movie:  A fictional movie producer's name is mentioned in this movie and its the name of one of my friends from my college days at the Univeristy of Tennessee at Knoxville.  I had to pause and scroll back and listen to be sure I head the name correctly.  I'm NOT going to mention my friend's name; but it was an odd coincidence.
Hopefully Doug Spearman is hard at work on a sequel to this brilliant comedy.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

6266955,4,B00IJZMZW4,"The movie was longer than I expected, the 105 run time felt like 2 hours, The acting is decent as well as the direction. I only gave it a look because I saw the Mark Anthony Samuel in it from General Hospital and Noahs Arc / DTLA's  Daryl Stephens, it's not a bad movie, it held my interest. I was hoping for a little more plot wise because I love mysteries, but based on how many actors were in the project you don't have a long list of suspects so figuring out the crime is pretty easy. Other than that it was entertaining enough for me to recommend. Amazon doesn't give many DVD details but if it had some behind the scenes/making of stuff I'd probably buy it/ otherwise rent it and then if you like it buy it. I would watch a sequel if there was one; I really wanted Mark to get more into the action sexually) but I know soap operas must have morality clauses because it seems like when a soap opera does something racy or inappropriate they get fired, but since GH has been pushing the envelope I was hoping for a little more action for his character.",1407024000,,1056,4.201970443349754

6266957,5,B00IJZMZW4,"An extremely entertaining film, centered around the tried and proven Buddy Flick format. Doug Spearman is a top notch director; I look forward to his continued work with great anticipation. I was particularly impressed by the photography. However, the jump-cut/leap-frog style of editing is simply not my cup of tea. I must say the highlight of this film is the dynamite performance by Marc Anthony Samuel. Known for his work over the last few years on ABC's General Hospital, Mr. Samuel is obviously as comfortable on a film set as he has proven to be in the television studio. The man has the chops to be a believable lead and has - at least to this reviewer - a commanding presence on screen as such. Personally, I hope to see him in more lead roles of varying style, i.e., stretch his wings and get the chance to show off his range, which is obviously there. Fabulous work, Doug, Marc and the rest of the cast and crew.-TSE, NorCal",1406505600,,935,4.571428571428571

They had a wonderful plot, a wonderful idea, and ruined it by sloppy acting and editing. One minute you're liking, and the next you're just like... did I just waste 4 dollars on this? Yes, yes you did. There's movies with less budgets that are better than this.",1403222400,,419,4.2375

For me, the dumber the movie, the more nudity I want to see and the nudity ratio was too low for me",1402358400,9,250,3.69811320754717

6266966,2,B00IJZMZW4,"This just shows how a trailer can fool you. This movie had potential, but it just fell flat. The things I was interested in ( like the robberies and the whys), the movie barely touched on in a bad way. The things that I didn't care for ( like the drug addicted mom or the sex scenes between 40 year old men), it constantly showed. I wanted more out of that main character, who is also on General Hospital. All of the actors in the film appear to be older than 35, but the film seems to be aimed at teenagers. Now I know that life is too short to take it seriously all the time, but the line has to be drawn somewhere. My advice is to rent instead of buy. Once you watch it one time, you won't want to watch it again.",1400976000,4,716,3.9448275862068964

8642740,4,B00IJZMZW4,"It was really fun and well done.  I'm glad I finally got to watch it.  Doug Spearman's story is original, smart and different that what other lgbt films have brought to the table.  I finally feel like Doug captured a real relationship between the two lead guys even if they were ex bf's.  It was very relatable  and complicated which is why it worked!  The comedy in the film worked.  It cracks me up that when someone tries to do something different and original, most people just complain and leave negative comments. Yet if the film was the same as everything else those same people would bitch.  (some people will just never be happy).  Marc Anthony Samuel was amazing in the film, all eyes were on him.  I loved all of the cast but Marc def stole the show and he's a very talented actor.  I would say give it watch, have fun and be entertained!",1515628800,,849,4.378205128205129
