3645889,5,B001HZ4K80,I liked this series of detective stories alot.  It was unique and very fun to watch.  I liked the characters alot and the stories.,1245283200,,130,4.375
3645890,5,B001HZ4K80,"The LAST DETECTIVE series is best watched in proper order, as there is a gentle story arc to follow. It won't kill the stories for you if you watch them randomly, but in order is best. This series, amazingly, has never aired in the USA. That is our loss!  With wit and terrific mysteries, the writers put together 17 episodes about ""Dangerous Davies,"" a milque toast detective whose nickname makes him the butt of yet another joke from his cronies.  And yet, Davis is a terrific detective, a truly inquisitive man whose gentle demeanor and insatiable need to make every piece fit have molded him into an unlikely sleuth and yet a brilliant one.  Davies' bumbling, perennially unemployed best friend, Mod, and his on-again, off-again sometimes-wife often contribute to the wit and comedy of this non-violent police procedural (which actually turns police procedurals on their head). The mysteries are gripping in that they are engaging rather than violent or suspenseful. You end up intrigued, and it is a joy to watch Davies pick up on tiny details and work them out.  Throughout the series, he does earn the grudging respect of at least some of his colleagues, and overall it is a very rewarding series to watch.  The end bit of each story, in which he and Mod reflect on things, is always priceless!",1243814400,44,1301,4.790178571428571

3645892,5,B001HZ4K80,My husband and I are great fans of Midsomer Murders but we have now seen all of them so we decided to try another series and this one is just as good. I recommend it if you are looking for a good murder series.,1242432000,7,210,3.7954545454545454
3645893,5,B001HZ4K80,If you like English mysteries you will like this one.  We are thoroughly enjoying it.,1238284800,2,85,4.666666666666667
3645894,5,B001HZ4K80,"This is an outstanding series! I'm not alone in this feeling, as the waiting list at the library was a month long . . .

I can't say enough great things about this show - starting with Peter Davison. With just a look he can convey a host of emotions. He plays his character, ""Dangerous"", with such an understated elegance - he is such a fine and watchable actor.

I also enjoyed his goofy best friend, ""Mod"". Really - all of the characters in this series are just top flight actors.

I am just so sad to hear that apparently there are no more episodes to be made. I know it is wildly popular show, so maybe this will be reconsidered in the future.",1231718400,51,647,4.201612903225806
3645895,4,B001HZ4K80,"""The Last Detective: The Complete Collection,"" comprising all 17 episodes of this superior British television mystery series, is now becoming available in the United States for the first time.  The series, a subversive police procedural, was made by Granada for the United Kingdom's Independent Television (ITV).  It made its debut on British broadcast television in February 2003, and has never been seen on broadcast TV here, which is our loss, as it is an excellent, character-driven production that offers a light-hearted blend of mystery and comedy similar to that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poirot-Investigates-Eleven-Complete-Mysteries/dp/1572703210/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poirot Investigates: Eleven Complete Mysteries</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Murder-Set-3/dp/B001A33ZHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Murder: Set 3</a>; or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-Thyme-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000WCN7M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary & Thyme - The Complete Series</a>. The collection comes at a value-packed price, and offers as a bonus, the 1981 treatment, starring Bernard Cribbins, that tells the same story as this series' pilot.

It's based on the ""Dangerous Davies"" novels of Leslie Thomas.  The veteran, highly thought of, everyman looking Peter Davison (Tristan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Creatures-Great-Small-The-Complete-Series-1-Collection/dp/6304973004/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Creatures Great & Small - The Complete Series 1 Collection</a>), stars as the title character, Detective Constable Davies (and it's quite a disgrace for an older man to be only a constable!)  He works in the totally unimportant, out of the way, North London precinct of Willesden.  And he's only the last detective in that he's the last detective his boss would assign to any case, had he his choice in the matter.  So Davies gets the least promising cases: yet, in his plodding fashion, he generally does get his man - or woman, as the case may be.

Emma Amos plays his sexy wife, Julie: in the complete collection you will see their relationship go through some changes, as she first throws him out, then takes him back.  Sean Hughes, (the guy from Eejit Records in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00018D3XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, plays his freeloading, quirky chum, Mod: we see him go through quite a few career changes in the complete collection, too. Rob Spendlove plays Detective Inspector Aspinall, the station house's tough supervisor.  Charles De'Ath as DS Pimlott and Billy Geraghty as DS Barrett add greatly to the flavor of the cop shop; and we get to see the three of them going through changes too.  Various well-known actors, such as Sian Philips, Norman Wisdom,David Threlfall and Susan Woordridge, guest star in supporting, but still meaty, roles.

The series manages to be witty and entertaining, yet still intellectually satisfying, with a minimum of onscreen violence.  Cinematography is fine, and it's firmly grounded in its North London location.  For better or worse, its actors have been encouraged to use that locale's flavorful accent: some may have trouble with it.  But it really is a pleasure getting to see all the episodes in sequence, and seeing the characters develop.  British mystery lovers: this one's for you.",1229126400,130,3614,6.6411889596602975
3645896,5,B001HZ4K80,This DVD set arrived on time and in good condition.  We have enjoyed every minute of this series and how a bumbling detective with low self esteem manages to solve so many difficult cases with little or no help I shall never understand.  His off -sider is a lazy idiot but always manages to contribute something to the story.  I have loved Peter Davison in everything I have viewed and this is no exception.,1503619200,,407,4.472972972972973

3645906,4,B001HZ4K80,"I love this series !  I would've given it 5 stars but it doesn't have subtitles.  I have to replay a lot of it, several times, in order to understand what some characters are saying.  And even then I don't always figure out the dialogue.  Sub-titles would have been lovely. Peter Davison is easy to understand, Sean Hughes is not.  The other detectives are a bit sketchy too.  The show itself is wonderful though.",1493337600,2,413,4.513513513513513

3645912,5,B001HZ4K80,"I watched all episodes of the Last Detective. The plotting is unexpected and the twists satisfying. Cohen is wonderful in the part. He's not your usual tough guy detective.  He plays a thoroughly decent, intelligent  guy  who deals with life as it is, always 'gets his man' and enjoys a laugh  spite of everything. Well worth watching.",1482796800,,335,4.824561403508772

3645929,4,B001HZ4K80,"This show grows on you.  I watched the first series and I liked it more as each episode went on.  This show is about a detective who simply does his job regardless of the dislike and mockery he faces on a daily basis.  Its realistic, in that, he uses old fashion detecting skills, nothing flashy but he gets the job done.  HIs personality is a bit unreal though as he takes a lot of flack without losing his temper.",1473206400,5,415,4.215189873417722

3645932,2,B001HZ4K80,"Stories are good, but no subtitles.  With all the English dialects, I could not understand most of what was said.  The character Mod added nothing to the series: poor acting, and he definitely was not funny.  Davison was the only bright spot in the series.  London must be a filthy place, from all the graffiti and garbage you see on the streets.  Very depressing to see what has happened there, but look at big cities in the US ---- same thing.  Do not recommend.",1471392000,4,464,4.464285714285714
3645933,5,B001HZ4K80,Thoroughly enjoyed this show.,1470960000,,29,6.5
3645934,5,B001HZ4K80,"Great series, but then that's what I've found with most British TV series.  You have to love Davison because he really does care and is always given the short end of the stick...yet, for all the grief and disrespect shown him by his fellow officers he always solves his cases.  Definitely a great addition to any video collection.",1470096000,,330,4.672413793103448
3645935,1,B001HZ4K80,Davison somewhat makes this almost watchable but overall poor quality writing/script.  His character is so weak and wimpy in this that it is almost painful to watch at times whether he is under assault from other officers that hate him or from his ex-wife.,1468713600,,256,4.818181818181818
3645936,4,B001HZ4K80,Well acted.  Peter Davison is excellent.  The stories are unusual but interesting.  The comedy is so-so.,1466812800,,104,5.375

3645938,4,B001HZ4K80,"This is when I wish I could put down 4.5.  It's not quite as gritty as a Bridge or Spiral but it's really cute.  It takes longer to grow on you (in my opinion) but I really like the quirkiness of his friend, Mod and Dangerous is very lovable.  Mod reminds me of a more likable Kramer from Seinfeld in that he's always thinking up something unusual.",1460332800,,348,4.164179104477612
3645939,4,B001HZ4K80,"This was an enjoyable series which I was initially attracted to because of the presence of Peter Davison.  But what annoys me about it is the premise which the title encapsulates: he's the last guy they'd send to solve a crime.  He gets no respect but he seems the only detective worthy of the name.  I've watched other series with quirky detectives and every time some police official doubts the wisdom of continuing to use him someone else points out  ""but he closes cases"".  The Davison character closes cases.  Give him some respect.",1458086400,,537,4.720430107526882

The DVDs (at least the ones I got) are a mixture of regions (1,2 & possibly others) which makes it almost impossible to watch and therefore is in its present format a complete waste of money. I'm not bothering to return them as it would cost more that buying more portable DVD Writers which I may do if I really want to watch them or have others similar.

3645981,5,B001HZ4K80,"Wonderful series! One of the best Brit Detective shows. The chemistry between Peter Davison and Sean Hughes is on par with any number of classic detective/sidekick combinations.

The benefit of owning the collection (apart from repeated viewings) is an interview with the actor Peter Davison, PLUS the 1981 movie of Dangerous Davies, which I didn't even know existed.

It's a shame it had to end, but there are 17 episodes (each of which is more like a short movie than a TV episode), so I guess for a British show that's a long time.",1410825600,5,534,4.670212765957447

3645987,5,B001HZ4K80,"Peter Davison plays a cross between a detective and social worker with masochistic flair.  Hit me again, I love the pain he seems to say to his boss, colleagues and his flighty wife. All the while displaying a patient genius for solving puzzling crimes.  Let's just say after subduing the urge to snap him out of his pathetic rollovers, he grows on you.  Yes it is a bit slow paced, and assertive training is called for here, but his goodness is too endearing to sneer for long.",1407196800,,478,4.471264367816092

3646001,4,B001HZ4K80,I love mysteries. I thought this one was going to have some humor in it. I don't think a continuous barrage of humiliating someone humorous. In fact it gets irritating. The story lines aren't bad but sometimes they are hard to follow. This isn't Pie in the Sky by any means but it's not bad. The main character is a lost soul who wants to contribute to society by being a police detective. He succeeds in spite of his many problems and obstacles.,1388880000,,446,4.385542168674699

I'd love to know the ""back story"" as to the discontinuation of the program. I rate the series a 5 star but the Bonus film included as part of the set simply won't play on my equipment. I want to rate the purchase a 1 star but that seems too unfair to the real series. I also as do others wish they had some way of identifying what's going on when their accents become so outrageously thick. Have to chuckle the Brits give the impression that they are the keepers of the English language, yet  their population speak as if they have a mouthful of mush.

3646016,4,B001HZ4K80,"This is a very solid entry in the British mystery series stakes. Peter Davison gives a nicely understated performance as the last detective to be thought of for any important case. The series has some great deadpan humor and (a nice touch) is set in the multi-racial London suburb of Willesden, giving it a more modern, urban feel without losing the traditional police procedural framework. The stories are interesting, the acting excellent and the characters well realised. Stories in which the underdog turns out to be the one to come out on top are always satisfying; this one is given a little twist in that Davies is seldom recognized for his good work. The essence of his character is that he accepts, indeed almost expects, that to be the case.

While not perhaps in the Morse or Midsomer Murders class, this is well worth watching unless you prefer something more in your face. It's about as far from non-stop action and dramatic confrontations as it's possible to get. There's lots of room in the genre for both types of show.",1317081600,9,1035,4.75
3646017,5,B001HZ4K80,"I was much too impatient to wait for this all-season collection before buying the DVD's of ""The Last Detective"", so I've got each season separately. I am very unhappy that there will apparently be no more of the everyman Dangerous Davies, played by Peter Davison.  This series evolved dramatically, from more lightweight fun to wrenching themes.

There are 17 shows in all, but they encompass a lot of air time.  The shows of the first three seasons were 70 minutes each.  The fourth, and last, season had five episodes of 90 minutes each.

The acting is great, including the supporting characters.  Dangerous' best friend, Mod (played by Sean Hughes), is maddening and hilarious! A lot of the show's humorous moments come from Dangerous' interactions with Mod.  Dangerous' boss, DI Aspinall (Rob Spendlove), has amazing depths, whether unpleasant or surprising. Julia, Dangerous' estranged wife (played by Emma Amos), is a true cipher - certainly Dangerous has trouble figuring her out - and for a time she's a character that you have fun disliking.  His snarky co-workers, DS Pimlott and DC Barrett are not fully realized. They put Dangerous down almost as afterthoughts and come through as pretty shallow. It would have been nice to see an episode or two where they're more fully explored.

All in all, the more you watch the show, the more the characters grow on you. The last season's shows are really in depth and thoughtful (as well as entertaining).  I highly recommend ""The Last Detective"".

3646018,5,B001HZ4K80,"A light detective series based on the ethics and occasionally mundane life of Dangerous Davies, a put down cop, unable to advance his career because of misunderstood circumstances. Between dealing with the hostility at work and his angry almost ex-wife, he is relieved from his daily stress by sharing a pint with his quirky and sometimes bizarre friend. Add a large unruly dog to the mixture and rather than having a pathetic, depressing scenario, you have a hilarious, well constructed story that is easy to follow.
