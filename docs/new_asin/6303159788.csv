7839955,5,6303159788,"The Princess and the Goblin has been my favorite movie for about 10 years now--and even though I'm a lot older, I still absolutely love it and find it very entertaining! The animation is excellent, the actors are wonderful, and the music is beautiful. People say it's ""just a kid's movie,"" but I don't think that's true at all. I watch it almost every day and NEVER get tired of it. The book is also wonderful. I recommend this movie to people of all ages. It's a true masterpiece!",1089504000,7,481,4.415730337078652
7839956,1,6303159788,"An absolute destruction of a wonderful book.  They merely told the story without depicting the soul.  A really sweet story about honesty, perseverance, and trust was turned into one where the only competent people were under the age of 10.  Poor acting, bad score, lackluster animation.",1064448000,5,286,5.173913043478261
