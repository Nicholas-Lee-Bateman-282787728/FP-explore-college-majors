5664041,3,B00BPFPNCE,"I love a good Glenn Ford western. I don't feel this was a great movie due to the writing. It is classic Glenn Ford but the movie was very predictable. No surprises. No where near as good as ""Fastest Gun Alive""!!!  If you can get this movie cheap its worth the watch only because Glenn Ford is such a great actor!!!
""Gunfighters Moon"" is amazing.t's not a Glenn Ford movie but it is one incredible Western!!!",1373500800,,407,4.355263157894737
5664042,5,B00BPFPNCE,"I have waiting a long time for this movie to come out on a DVD format, and it was worth the wait. Glenn Ford has always been one of my favorite actors. He can play comedy as well as a serious part. This movie and the Sheepman are two of his many westerns I like best. These movies are tame compared to the western of C.E., but they had a good story and you could believe the character.",1367625600,9,385,3.948717948717949
5664043,5,B00BPFPNCE,"One of my favorite Western films that is rarely seen.  Great assortment of actors, Barbra Hershey, Caroline Jones, and even a small part with Angelique Pettybone as a prostitute in the saloon, (before she started doing porn).
A typical cattlemen vs. sheep herders, but with a gunslinger turned preacher keeping it all together.",1366416000,8,327,5.169811320754717

5664050,3,B00BPFPNCE,"Glenn Ford  was a gifted actor, especially in westerns, and comedies, and cop movies. In this story which started well, ended, for those of us who expect wild western shootouts, it to be exactly that, it ended badly.
In his first and what turned out to be his last draw and shoot gun fight at close range, he shoots down two hired gunmen, and opens a church in which he the noted gunman, it turns out is also to be a preacher.  Okay so far so good, but that is the beginning of its falling apart, at least for me. I bestowed the 3 stars for his acting, his sense of humor, and his always cool approach to evil. Then, at least in my book, it begins to unravel into vast unlikeliness, and making me wonder whose foolish idea was it to make the ending so childish.
I won't spoil it for you, but I thought the ending was unjust, impossible and stupid. It would never happen, and to my knowledge of the old west, never did. The ending was an insult to the talents against glowing and large reputation of one of a hall of fame western actors Glenn Ford. Any way hats off to Ford for carrying the last several minutes of a silly finish, which in moments makes the hero become the victim of the writers or directors.",1429315200,,1208,4.225108225108225

5664054,5,B00BPFPNCE,"One of a select number of exceptional westerns.  Glenn Ford's performance is one of his best.  The film has a somewhat authentic feel to it and
the supporting performances are right-on-trsget, especially that of Noah Beery.  Moves well and is quite touching at times.  Highly recommended.
Touches on biogotry well and projects sensitivity and humanity quite well.  Exciting and moves at a very good pace.  Supoerior on many levels including photography  theme music and direction.",1424736000,2,480,5.32

5664060,5,B00BPFPNCE,Glenn Ford is at his best and in his element in Heaven With a Gun. I always thought he was under appreciated and never got the respect and recognition he so richly deserved. Even though Glenn Ford is no longer with us I'm so glad we can still enjoy his work. In the near future I'm planning on purchasing Glenn in 2 other outstanding westerns such as The Violent Men and The Sheepman.,1415318400,,384,4.273972602739726

5664067,5,B00BPFPNCE,Glenn Ford has always been a favorite actor of mine.  I like the role he plays in this movie.  Of course it helps he plays the good guy!  There are very few movies that I dislike.  This one is good.  The suspense of how the plot will lead you is good.  Purchase this DVD people.

5664071,4,B00BPFPNCE,"Heaven With A Gun had the potential to be a great movie, and in the hands of a Anthony Mann, Henry Hathaway or Delmer Daves, it just might have been. As it stands, directed by Lee Katzin, primarily a TV director, the movie's just fair to good. What helps is the screenplay by Richard Carr. Like the part played by Glenn Ford, the characters in this movie are never quite what they seem to be, and there's more than a few surprises in store. Basically I feel that the material is worthy of a much better director. There's a surprising amount of material in the film that today would probably give it an R rating - some torture, bloodshed and nudity, so I couldn't recommend this to a younger audience. The film score, by Johnny Mandell, is just plain awful. The bad score, along with some fairly boring camera work, give the film at times, the look and feel of a made-for-TV movie, which isn't surprising considering the directors credentials.
All in all, though, I recommend this Western, as  one that has a ""little more on it's mind""  than usual Oater. Watch this interesting movie, and imagine how good it would be with a really good western director!",1380844800,3,1153,4.538461538461538
5664072,1,B00BPFPNCE,"I WANT MY $ BACK!!!! This movie was misrepresented. It did not give you a warning that it was rated M. It had nudity in it and was a LOUSY movie. I am extremely displeased. In fact, I may never order another movie from Amazon again if this is the best that can be done in representing movies for sale.

8572236,5,B00BPFPNCE,"You've seen this scenario before: Cattlemen and sheepherders fighting over a piece of land with grass and water. Into the middle of this fracas rides Jim Killian, gunman and preacher, determined to get and maintain peace in the valley.  That isn't going to be easy...

The cast of this 60's Western is deep.  Glenn Ford is Jim Killian, former gunfighter and convict, and still blessed with a wicked fast draw.  John Anderson is Esa Beck, the crusty leader of the cattlemen, willing to maim and kill to keep the land for his cattle. Noah Beery has a nice supporting role as his foreman.  J.D. Cannon is a hired gun, out to get Jim Killian.  The cast also includes a young David Carradine and a young Barbara Hershey.

The story works well, as Killian and Beck circle for advantage, and as Beck becomes increasingly ruthless in his means.  In the end, Killian will have to decide whether he is really a man of God, or only a man with a gun.  Great movie from the days when Westerns were king; recommended as good entertainment with a message.",1489276800,,1040,4.548387096774194

8572239,4,B00BPFPNCE,"In the New Mexico town of Vinegarroon, there's no church, but there's a land war between cattlemen and ""sheepers""--sheep raisers who, the ranchers say, will ruin the range.  When Jim Killian (Glenn Ford) stops to bury one of the victims, he quickly finds himself in a fight with Coke Beck (David Carradine) and his buddy Ned Hunter (Roger Perry)--which he wins.  In town, he buys an old barn (winning most of the price at poker), then goes to visit Coke's father Asa (John Anderson), at whose ranch he finds a sheepman, Scotty Andrews (Ed Bakey) being ""clipped""--and stops it.  Andrews's fellow sheepmen soon learn of the incident and invite him to work for them--something Asa has already done.  Come to town tomorrow at noon, Jim says, and we'll talk about it.  To everyone's astonishment, when they arrive, he's nailing up a sign that proclaims the barn a church and himself the pastor.  That he's also a fast gun confuses them no end.  But he's determined to ""protect anyone who comes to my church""--cattleman, sheepman, or town-dweller.  And he's also eager to settle the war before it can get any worse than it already is.  He even makes some progress, enlisting several of the sheepmen and rancher Bart Paterson (William Bryant) in a daring experiment to see whether cattle and sheep can be grazed together.  But Asa Beck isn't giving in.  When Ned is murdered by the vengeful Andrews, Jim's self-enlisted halfbreed housekeeper Leloopa (Barbara Hershey) is attacked by Coke, and his former Yuma cellmate, a gunman named Mace (J. D. Cannon), comes to town as Asa's hire, things start to get really rough.  Now Jim must make a decision: will he resolve this situation as a man of the gun, or as a man of God?  The solution he chooses may both surprise and inspire you.

Parents should be aware that there are a couple of incidents of nudity, two semi-graphic murders, and implied rape and prostitution in the film, which might be considered a rougher version of Ford's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sheepman/dp/B003552QXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sheepman</a>.  Long-time character actor Bryant has an especially nice part as a cattleman who ""came here about the same time [Asa] did...fought the same battles...[but] my dreams weren't as big as his...,"" and Noah Beery, Jr., is equally good as Garvey, the Beck foreman, who ""slapped the first breath of life into [Coke]...dug the hole for his ma...""",1451692800,,2459,5.1125
