563063,4,6303102492,"I love the fact that when she came back home that she didn't hide her heritage. Pinky, who called herself Patricia when 'passing' as white. Came back to her hometown to see her grandmother and a patient, (who is her grandmother's employer)  tells her to accept who she is. And that the black side of the town needed medical attention,and schooling young,black women to
become nurses also.",1022889600,10,388,4.791044776119403
563064,4,6303102492,"This is a landmark film, as it tackled issues that were considered to be taboo at the time. Race hate, miscegenation, and passing for white are some of its themes. Unlike ""Imitation of Life (1934), which in its own fashion dealt with the themes of passing for white and the unequal opportunities afforded blacks, this is not a sentimental tearjerker of a movie. Rather, there is an undercurrent of anger and righteousness that permeates it, and rightly so. It is a hard edged, no holds barred type of film. There is nothing sentimental about it.
Controversial in its time, the film is about a young bi-racial woman known as ""Pinky"" (Jeanne Crain), sent up north by her southern granny (Ethel Waters), so that she could receive an education. While up North, she begins passing for white inadvertently, as that is how she is apparently perceived, and makes no move to correct that perception. She studies and works hard, becoming a nurse. She then meets white Dr. Thomas Adams (William Lundigan), and they fall head over heels in love. He has no idea, however, of her background and knows her as ""Patricia"" not ""Pinky"".
Pinky, leaving him behind, returns home to the South one last time to confront her past and her personal demons. She ends up meeting bigotry head on, as down South where Pinky is known she is treated as blacks are treated, and does not like it one bit. It hardens her resolve all the more to return North and continue passing for white. She would like nothing better than to put as much distance as is possible between herself and her racial heritage. Helping out her grandmother, however, she ends up playing nurse to Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore), a crotchety, crusty, and ill eighty year old former plantation owner who has come down on hard times.
When Miss Em dies, she wills her estate to Pinky, creating a controversy that rocks the town when the will is challenged by distant relatives, the Wooleys. They are outraged and claim that the ""colored girl"" used undue influence over the elderly Miss Em. This galvanizes Pinky to stand up for her rights, enduring a mockery of a trial. Moreover, when Dr. Adams comes looking for her, Pinky finds herself taking a position with respect to their relationship that is a revelation to herself.
This is a film that at the time was highly controversial, due to its themes. It was a film that was certainly daring for its times. Why they cast a white woman for the part of a biracial character may seem puzzling to those of us in the twenty first century. I presume that this casting was mandated because there were love scenes between Pinky and her fiance, Dr. Adams, and this type of scene would have been forbidden in those days, if the actress cast for the part of Pinky were other than white. While a bi-racial woman was cast for the role of Peola, the woman who passed for white, in ""Imitation of Life"" in 1934, it was a safe bet to do so, as she had no love scenes with which to contend. Notwithstanding the casting of Jeanne Crain in the role of Pinky, this film was cutting edge stuff in 1949.
Wonderful performances are given by the entire cast. Ethel Waters, Jeanne Crain, and Ethel Barrymore all received Academy Award nominations for their roles in this film, though none of them won. While Jeanne Crain's casting was a stretch for her as an actress, she did give it her all, letting the viewer sense Pinky's discomfort and angst over the racial divide. Ethel Waters is superb as the hard working, humble soul who did the best that she could for her beloved Pinky. As the imperious Miss Em, Ethel Barrymore was perfectly cast and gives a superlative performance, imbuing the character with a humanity that a lesser actress may not have. All in all, this is a movie that lovers of classic films should enjoy and one that should be in any serious movie lover's collection.",1017532800,189,3842,4.626647144948755
563065,4,6303102492,"When I first read the description of this movie at the back of the video  cover, I said""Oh Brother!! Another 'Imitation Of Life'!!!!!""  While I watched the film, I realized that this is not like IOL!! Pinky  actually overcomes the racism in the South when she wins that court case  against that snobby lady!!
My only criticism of this movie is that it is  sooo stereotypical! The Ethel Waters character in the movie was illiterate  and she was a servant.",969235200,5,454,4.6125
563066,4,6303102492,"And ""Pinky"" came 10 years before ""Imitation of Life.""
The criticism of casting ""lily-white Jeanne Crain"" for the part of Pinky is quite unjust.
I was born and raised in the  South and and I saw nothing unbelievable in casting Ms. Crain in this part.  Genetics - skin color, eye color and other physical characteristics are  capable of being quite capricious.
The fact that this film was banned  in the South should tell us something about the power in this movie  ""Pinky.""
The movie itself was a wee bit over-acted as old  dramatic flicks sometimes are, but I really enjoyed it. A lot of substance  in the message - about how to define what we really are and how to define  what makes a family and the power of unconditional love to heal and to  save.
But my favorite character was Ethel Waters (the Aunt who raises  Pinky). She was an incredible actress and completely believable in this  role. Humble, gentle, self-sacrificing and ever-loving - while enduring her  thankless jobs as nursemaid to a grouch and washwoman who worked for  pennies - her part stole the show.",957484800,20,1071,4.663101604278075
563067,3,6303102492,"The movie was a ""weak"" attempt at recreating the classic ""The Imitation of Life"".  What this movie did accomplish was to show how racist the movie industry was during that time, to cast a white  female in the role of a mixed woman. During that era I guess it is  understandable why Black people were trying to pass. It is sad how a people  could deny the beautiful hertiage of their African ancestors.  The  performance of Ethel Waters was enjoyable I'm glad that at least a Black  woman was cast for her role. I do enjoy the Black and White films for their  artistic value. It is a must see picture for the present and future  generations that may try to ""pass"" for something they can never  become.",944956800,4,700,4.3984375
563068,3,6303102492,If not necessarily for dramatic value.  Although the story is certainly a compelling one the film is incredibly predictable.  What is worth noting however are the racial attitudes that existed for all negroes regardless of  skin tone by both white and colored people at that time.,944611200,6,280,5.043478260869565
563069,5,6303102492,"Although this movie is somewhat dated, it has a message that is still important:  you must be true to yourself.  This was one of the first films to successfully deal with racism.  So controversial was this film in 1949  it was banned in the south.  The performances by all three women are very  good.  Jeanne Crain's scenes with Ethel Barrymore are especially moving.  I'm surprised by the review from Amazon.  You can't look at this film with  the eyes of someone living in the 1990s.  Pinky should be appreciated for  addressing a subject that hadn't been addressed at all up until this film  was made.  From a technical level, this film is nicely put together. The  music, the cinematography are all first rate.  As film history, it's worth  taking a look.",943747200,46,759,4.67175572519084
563070,1,6303102492,"I had heard so much about this movie for years that I was willing to pay any price just to see it.  Well it was aired on channel 7 during Black History month.  Was I ever disappointed.  Don't tell me there was no  light-skinned black actress to portray the role of the daughter.  Don't get  me wrong, it was a good story.  But as a black woman I could not get past  the fact that this was a real white woman trying to PASS for black.  Get  Real!!",922233600,8,446,3.965909090909091

This movie has been unavailable in any form for nearly 20 years. Turner knows what's best for us to see as long as his copyright is in effect.

563743,5,6303102492,"must confess that I am not fond of watching movies that has to do with racism because it makes me uncomfortable. PINKY is a movie that tells the story of a mulatto young lady should I say that was raised by her African American grandmother in the deep south. Those were the days in which racism was at it heighest peek in the deep south. I know what I am talking about because I've been there and had hand to hand combact with it. It is very unfortunate that there are many human being on this globe that are naive to the vital rool that every race, color, creed and national origin play in our world. People need to be taught that no race or color is better that each other they are just different. when we go to the flower shop to buy a boque of flowers most of the time we get a variety of flowers because it makes it more attractive right? yes it does the same is true when we go to the Dept. store to buy a new set of linnens. My friends variety is the spice of life that what makes our world beautiful in the sight of God and man.
 Pinky was just a young lady caught in the throws of an unfriendly world of people that think that only they have the rights to exiest on this globe. Almost every white person that she encounter upon her return from medical school had a problem with her been connected to the black race. Pinky was so frustrated with the condition that exiested in the small town that she wanted to serve as a nouse that she wanted to go back to the place where she was trained as a nurse.

I have a word of advise to all my friends out there that are controle by the spirit of racism, no one was born a racises, racism is something that is learned or taught. If a baby is raised by a person be it black of white, that child will grow to love that person regardless of the person's color until some one of his kind inculcate evil into the mind of that child. If Pinky was left alone to live comfortable with her grandmother undisturbed Pinky's life would not have been miserable like the way it was. I am happy that at the end of the day she defied all odds including the doctor that wanted her to abandone her grandmother and the people that turned their little town into a living hell for black people to stay and fight back. My friend I want to make something very clear, I don't have one drop of blood in my vain that is prejudice. I was sent to school in Texas by a white man that I loved dearly with his family. I have white friends in the south that were willing to die for me if push had come to shove, what I am saying is that not all white people are bad the same way not all black people are bad. I love every one the only thing I dislike  about people of any race is their bad attitude. Therefore my advice to those that read this review is to watch PINKY and I am sure you will learn something from it because you will see",1439164800,7,2855,4.0495575221238935

564070,4,6303102492,"Pinky, 1949 film

A steam locomotive runs in the background. A young woman walks along a dirt road carrying a suitcase and stops at a humble cottage. Pinky has returned home after an education up north (as a nurse). Granny takes in washing and helps an elderly woman, the owner of a big mansion. Pinky goes to collect a debt from Jake Waters. It is her grandmothers money that was supposed to be sent to her. There is a dispute over this money. A policeman administers Southern street justice and explains why he has to slap them down. The Judge dispenses justice in court. Pinky worked to get an education. Jake Waters visits Granny and shows his humble arrogance. Two young men drive by, drink, and attack her; but she gets away to home. Granny tells of a sick neighbor, Miss M needs a trained nurse. But Pinky wants to leave until Granny tells her what Miss M did for her when she was sick.

Nurse Patricia attends Miss M when she has an attack. The time is noted. Miss Ms meanness is a good sign says Granny. Doctor Kennedy asks Miss Johnson to help in training, but she plans to leave. Pinky converses with Miss M. Returning home she finds an old friend, Tom, who tracked her down. They talk. Whats rational about prejudice? [Whats rational about humans in general? Doesnt emotion overrule logic? What about peer pressure?] Miss Ms cousin comes for a visit. Should Miss M make a will? Pinky is commanded to bring paper and ink. Later she collapses from another attack. Her doctor witnesses her will; he says she doesnt have much time. It comes true. Pinky buys a mourning veil. Mrs. Wooley objects to Pinkys presence in the store. [Note the change in price.] The doctor reads Miss Ms will and says it will be contested. Darcey and Pinky are the heirs. I wonder why she did it? What will be the use of this property?

Jake Waters arrives with news and advice. There may be trouble if Pinky stays. Will Judge Walker act for Pinky? Now she needs a job to pay court costs. She can only work as a laundress. Doctor Thomas Adams returns with newspaper clippings. There is a court scene over the will. Judge Walker speaks in her defense and calls Dr. Joseph McGill. The Police Chief testifies. Then Mrs. Wooley testifies about Miss Ms medical condition. So too Aunt Darcey. The will is declared valid. There is a disagreement from the spectators in court. Doctor Tom is fixing to move to Denver where no one knows them. But Pinky plans to stay to use the property to benefit people as a clinic and a nursery school, named after Miss M.

What a happy ending in using a big plantation mansion to benefit the neighborhood! But they did not tell where the money for this came from. I wonder why Miss M ended up so poor? Did her father or brother squander the family wealth on poor investments or gambling? This story by Cid Ricketts Sumner displays life before the Civil Rights Act of 1965. Does this attitude exist today? Does emotion and prejudice go on forever? But the legal support for this is gone. This drama is both entertaining and educational. Did it paint a too pretty picture of life among the lowly? It pointed out the importance of education. Was that three-year course for a Registered Nurse or a Practical Nurse?",1426291200,,3222,4.521440823327616

She tried to fit into the white world in Boston but felt more comfortable at home with her people.  The point of the movie is to show that color does matter because once white people find out she's part colored, they treat her like they do other black people in the city - very poorly and disrespectfully.
There was controversy with Jeanne Crain playing an interracial woman.  She was called out by the likes of Lena Horne who felt a light-skinned black actress should have been cast.

564786,5,6303102492,"I happened to finally get around to watching the movie Pinky, I must say, that this movie was really well acted and told.  Patricia 'Pinky' Johnson--a fair skinned, black woman--has finally returned home from her northeast college, where she'd passed as white.  While receiving her education, she falls in love with a white doctor, who doesn't know she's black.  Her granny is very disappointed Pinky had been aloof in communication and denying her black identity.  Meanwhile, Miss Em, played by the great Ethel Barrymore, a rich woman, develops a heart illness -- since Pinky has experience and training with nursing her granny asks her to help Miss Em.  Pinky has past bitterness towards Miss Em dating back to her childhood yet with reasonable convincing she goes ahead and help nurse Miss Em.  Later you will see the meat and potatoes of the movie start to unfold as you will be introduced to Melba Wooley (Em's gossipy, chatty cousin) and Dr. Thomas Adams (the handsome boyfriend of Pinky).  Both characters play impactful roles into the rising action and climax of the story.  For anyone who finds this picture to be unrealistic or can't see Jeanne Crain being a black woman shouldn't be so far-fetched.  If you look at alot The Fords (US political black family from the south), Quincy Jones children, and director Darnell Martin are quite fair-skinned, almost passing for white.  In my opinion, I think Jeanne did a great job with the material and in no way she was ""cooning"" her performance, so kudos there.  I would definitely say pick this one up and you as the viewer be the judge.",1329523200,2,1592,4.8161764705882355

On the journey, she is mistaken for white, and decides she likes 'passing' so much so, that she continues to do so when she is away at school. Returning home to the south after school and when her white boyfriend becomes serious, Pinky must face all the reasons she wanted to leave in the first place: racism, prejudice and villainy.

I really enjoyed Pinky and I thought the drama was poignant and worth viewing. Pinky is a character you can empathize with as her struggles and temptation to pass are quite strong. The other small town characters are amusing too, from the old battle-axe Aunt Em, to her grandmother, to the town hustler.

While embracing the 'tragic mulatta' stereotype, which Hollywood can't seem to get over, it was less offensive because Pinky manages to come out alright even if it means losing her white boyfriend and embracing a professional career rather than love. I'd like to see a sequel where Pinky finds both.",1316822400,,1046,4.679347826086956

When her white boyfriend comes from the north, he discovers Pinky's secret but is ready to marry her--if they keep the secret to themselves. Pinky must decide who she is and where she belongs.

Although Pinky is played by a white actress, Jeanne Crain, as the dictates of the time it was made would have demanded, this is a moving story. Ethel Waters plays Pinky's grandmother and Ethel Barrymore is Miss Em. The three ladies were nominated for Academy Awards for their roles in the film.",1313020800,,838,4.406451612903226
564893,3,6303102492,"Pinky (20th Century Fox, 1949) was director Elia Kazan's fifth film.

Always on the lookout for a ""message"" script, 20th Century Fox mogul, Darryl F. Zanuck, followed the success of ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" (Best Picture, 1947), which tackled the issue of anti-Semitism, with ""Pinky"" (1949) a film dealing with racial prejudice against African-Americans.

Patricia ""Pinky"" Johnson (Jeanne Crain) returns home to Alabama after graduating from nursing school in Boston. She is mixed race but has absolutely no physical characteristics typical of Blacks and easily passed herself off as White in the North. When her Black Granny, Dicey (Ethel Waters), asks Pinky to nurse her dying friend, Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore), matron of the crumbling former plantation, Pinky acquiesces after some serious misgivings and eventually befriends the old dame. All the while Pinky encounters blatant racism whenever the White townsfolk discover she's actually of mixed race. When her boyfriend from up North tracks her down he is quite surprised to learn from Pinky that she is a mulatto but continues the relationship. After Miss Em's death, the entire town is shocked to learn she willed her estate to Pinky. A judge remarkably (and unbelievably) upholds the will. Rejecting her suitor's invitation to leave the town and her true racial identity behind, Pinky turns the old plantation into ""Miss Em's Clinic and Nursery School"" for Black children.

Kazan took over the project as a favor to Zanuck after director John Ford quit over confrontations with Ethel Waters. Pinky would be the last film Kazan would make in a traditional studio setting. All subsequent Kazan movies were shot on location. Kazan mentioned quite often that he disliked Pinky intensely. It was an emasculated morality play. The casting of white-as-the-driven-snow Jeanne Crain ensured there would be few problems showing the film in the South, but it took the teeth out of the picture. Beautiful Jeanne Crain in the arms of William Lundigan was fine but a light-skinned, beautiful African-American such as Lena Horne or Dorothy Dandridge in the arms of Ludigan at that time would have been outrageous. It is certainly difficult for the viewer to suspend belief and accept Crain as dark-skinned Water's granddaughter. But Pinky does portray racism in a convincing manner in several scenes.

Controversy aside, the cast is fantastic and I've come to appreciate Pinky a bit more with each viewing. Both Waters and Barrymore, the First Lady of the Theater, were nominated for Oscars for their potrayals. Most memorable in minor roles are Frederick O'Neal as Jake Walters, Evelyn Varden as Melba Wooley, Nina Mae McKinney as the foxy Rozelia, and Basil Ruysdael as Judge Walker. Dan Riss as Wooley's stereotypical Southern lawyer is absolutely delightful. Surprisingly, Crain was nominated for Best Actress for her performance. Kazan disparaged Crain in several of his later writings and interviews. I don't believe he criticized any of his other actors so fiercely. There's no doubt that Crain had an extremely limited emotional scale but one must wonder if there was also something personal behind Kazan's assessment. The closing scene with Crain looking up to Heaven and thanking Miss Em is actually quite touching. Pinky was no minor liberal experiment for Zanuck; it was the second-highest grossing film for Fox in 1949.

Kazan was still searching for his signature style when he directed Pinky. He would find it while making his next film, the remarkable film noir thriller, Panic in the Streets.

Film historian Kenneth Geist provides an unremarkable commentary for this DVD. His remarks have much more to do with the careers of Waters and Barrymore than with the film itself. This DVD is very nicely packaged with an outer box along with a small booklet and four mini-lobby cards.",1312156800,5,3838,5.212317666126419
564894,5,6303102492,"Here is an interesting movie!  ""Pinky"" is about a light-skinned young black woman from the deep South who goes north for nursing school, where she passed for white.  The lead role is played to perfection by Jeanne Crain with almost total credibility.  JC returns home for a visit, which becomes somewhat ""extended"". That stay is the basis of the plot. That's all this review will reveal, in the interest of not divulging the resolution.

Crain is by far the central character here, ably supported by a fine cast including Ethel Waters as her grandmother and Ethel Barrymore as the dying old woman she is pressed into caring for. ""Pinky"" is well-directed by Elia Kazan.  Continuity from scene to scene is excellent.  Viewer interest is maintained throughout. This is a fast moving movie.  It must have taken courage for Ms. Crain to play such a role back in 1949. I have always liked her pictures and wondered why she never became a major star. JC certainly was a mysteriously attractive woman. One wonders what would have resulted if John Ford remained as the original director. The record will show that the Academy recognized ""Pinky"". Crain was nominated for Best Actress; Waters and Barrymore for Best Supporting Actress.  Statues went instead to Olivia de Haviland for ""The Heiress"" and Mercedes McCambridge for ""All the Kings Men"".

The only negative comment this reviewer can muster deals with that strange house review by amazon. What was the writer thinking?  Also, previous reviewer ""Larry C"" (a major Crain devotee) should know that another JC gem, ""Dangerous Crossing"" is indeed available for purchase on amazon. Both feature Crain in challenging roles which allowed her considerable talents to blossom.",1302825600,2,1714,5.046099290780142

564896,5,6303102492,"I just watched this movie, and despite inconsistencies that seem to draw criticism from a modern 60 years later perspective, this is a great movie. I am not going to summarize the plot in detail. That is ably done in many reviews, and I don't want to be a major spoiler for someone who just wants a worthiness opinion to consider watching this, and more importantly a perspective to appeciate it.

In order to fully appreciate this movie, I think one has to partly watch this movie as if you were in 1949 when it came out. A detachment from the modern makes this movie understandable and believable. Jeanne Crain's portrayal of a black woman is the focus of the central criticism of this movie, but that is easily explained if one considers the scene where she is nearly raped. In fact, there is some subtlety missed by many other reviewers in some of the character portrayals in this move. Does Miss Em know who Pinky's father and grandfather are? Watch the Judge Walker character carefully, brilliantly played by Basil Ruysdael? He seems to know something about Pinky. Kazan was a genius in how he directed this apparent subtlety into the movie, clearly something the producers could never have risked in the script, not in 1949. One couldn't boldly suggest  the rape of successive generations of black women by white men, possibly the same white man, not in 1949. It had to be extremely subtlety played for its time without inciting even more wrath than the film likely did from the bigots of the era. Also revealing too much would have changed the entire message of the movie.

Again, Crain is criticized for taking on or being chosen for this role, but she played it beautifully considering the complexities being asked of her. One can again see the hand of Kazan's direction. Also keep in mind the tremendous career risk she took at the time. Many have commented on the inconsistency of a white woman playing a black woman, but would it have worked if an obvious black woman were playing the role and were pretending no one suspected she was black? I don't think so, because we have to believe that Pinky can unambiguously pass for being white as the main premise of the story. What could have greatly reinforced the verisimilitude and character development would have been an earlier scene that might have shown her in the role of faking being white in her job in the north. This could also have made the romantic element more believable.

There are weaknesses in this movie. These have been pointed out by others. The love story chemistry is hard to believe between Pinky and her doctor beau. They don't look involved, or look like they have an intimate history they've shared. Also, I agree the scene of their embrace in court is unrealistic in not eliciting violence from the spectators. The seething hate and bigotry are clearly too muted at times.

Besides Crain, there are other great performances. Ethel Barrymore has some wonderfully deleivered lines. For those who first see her in this movie, her performance is a real treat. Ethel Waters is great also, but constrained to play her role stereotypically for the time. There is some weakness in the Pinky - grandmother realtionship on screen, but I can't tell whether this is due to Crain, Waters or possibly some conflict with Kazan's direction. Reportedly, Waters was difficult to direct, or at least had a strained realtionship with Kazan, and I sense that Kazan let some scenes slip by unperfected out of exasperation.

I strongly recommend this movie. However, one has to think from the perspective of a 1949 viewer who doesn't know the greater truth telling of the civil rights movement or the even greater To Kill A Mocking Bird are in the future. From that perspective, this movie is reality of what risks could be taken in 1949 movie making and fill a theatre. And,  when having difficulty with Crain's casting as Pinky, look for subtlety in how some other characters treat her, and wonder what they might have been able to suggest less subtlety about her father/grandfather if the time was not 1949 America.",1295049600,3,4082,4.757062146892656
564897,5,6303102492,"This is a film I've avoided watching in the past, but finally was drawn into tonight on TCM.  In light of recent news events involving a troubling resurgence of overt racism since electing Barack Obama the 44th president, the seemingly dated portrayal of bigotry and politics of the south have never been more evident.  The film's story gets it completely right.  The author should be applauded.  Especially considering that other novels of Cid Ricketts Sumner were ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" and the sequels. He seems to have quickly left the arena of controversy regarding films.

I found myself completely relating to the character of Pinky for reasons other than race.  Her desire to be true to herself is universal.  Possibly more so for women than men.  The brazen way white men sexually assaulted her is ugly to see.  We know this is far too true.  We see it coming from the Tea Party.  We see it coming from local politicians thinking their attitude is something not to be ashamed of.  The ugliest side of our nature is that of racism.

This film was directed by Elia Kazan (who replaced John Ford).  One has to wonder what the different eye and mind would have presented.  As it is, it's a mirror to ourselves.  I certainly hoped we'd left this behind.  But parts of the south and the minds of the ignorant seem to be timeless presences.  We have to cope.

I vote for Pinky.  What a wonderful character she was/is.",1294358400,3,1421,4.6305220883534135

564899,5,6303102492,"PINKY has already been covered by great reviews here, so I'll try to be brief. Made in 1949 (black & white), this film was about 12 years before the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement in the South. For younger people today who don't know what it was like to be black in the South--it was HELL. The level of white ignorance & sheer hatred (in many instances) was terrible, and could be downright horrific. Fortunately, we've all come a LONG way from those days. However, in 1949 this film is of great documentary value; but don't let that scare you off, it's a great movie too. Top notch actors, script & direction. It's even got a great court  scene near the end.

OK. So all else I have to say is this: I read a review where a black reviewer expressed dissatisfaction that a black woman wasn't cast in the lead role (""Pinky"" is a black woman who easily ""passes"" as white & has a blond hunk, Northern boy friend.) I won't comment on that--but what did impress me about the movie was how successfully Jeanne Crain's acting, subtle make-up & hair, Elia Kazan's skilled direction & production lighting created an authenticity of the racial theme. There were times, particularly in profile, when it really looked like an African American was acting the role.

That's it. Considering the people who were involved in the production--and its' theme, of course--PINKY is a video document reflecting American cultural history.

PS.The romantic interest with the hunk doctor doesn't quite pan out, but the movie's got a upbeat ending anyway.

When her grandmother sent her to the big city in the north, she ""passed"" as white. See there is a way of thinking which says that if you have ""one drop"" of Black blood in you (for those who don't understand DNA) that you are Black. Well, in polite, intelligent society- who cares?

After becoming a nurse, Pinky returns to her hometown and at first she is treated as White and once that her identity is discovered, you see her instant transformation to a Black person.

565155,5,6303102492,"Let's start with the casting of Jeanne Crain.  There ARE mixed race women who are as light as Jeanne Crain, but because of the ""one drop rule,"" they were in 1949, and often still today are considered black.  In today's multi-cultural society these women often embrace their heritage, but the issues they face remain sadly the same today in many facets.  African Americans today who are educated are often told they are ""talking white.""

  There is a reason that ""she's passing"" became an understood term.  Very light skinned women & men DID try to do what Pinky here does.

  I find this film completely, sadly relevant.  These conversations of segregation and intermarriage are STILL going strong.  There are African Americans who talk about ""white women taking our men"" or ""stay with your own race."" This is segregationist, this is racist, and it still exists very strongly in all racial communities.

  Dorothy Dandridge and Lena Horne - great talented beauties, are often mentioned as possible contenders for this role.  They were NOT light enough to pass for white, it hampered their careers, and they have both acknowledged that.

  Hollywood in general likes their races obvious, casting is still largely done by type and stereotype, no matter what race - even today it would be hard to find an actress of stature who identifies herself as black, but who can totally pass as white; the market doesn't hire these women.  Even today my dark skinned actress friends have been told they don't ""talk black enough"" in auditions.  Ethel Waters & Ethel Barrymore are cases in point here.  Both fine actresses are playing the same roles they have played in other movies.  Both are wonderful, both were completely type cast.

  The greatness is in little things like the scene with Nina Mae McKinney next to Frederick O'Neal, next to Jeanne Crain, all 3 differnet skin tones, all playing black folks.  THAT is the reality of mysogenation in the South, and that is what people still have trouble with:  sometimes race is not just black and white. (McKinney is fantastic, and fills every single second of her screen time to the brim, from the pebble in her shoe to coyly playing piano on the top of a fence.)

  Jeanne Crain had enormous courage to portray this role.  Not only is she perpetually faulted for being a white woman playing this role, but it was a career risk, some people questioned her heritage in a racist age.  That is a tribute to the reality and sensitivity she brought to the role, and her acting, which is often maligned because she had reserve.  Her ""under"" acting is actually the preferred style today in tv and film.  She was ahead of her time.  Even Kazan eventually credited her work.

  This movie is sensitively done in all respects with really great performances top to bottom.  It is not glossy or simple, neither race is soley good or soley bad.  It is a disservice to have the only commentary done by someone who clearly still does not like the film and doesn't appreciate the complexity of Crain's work here.  That a New Yorker thought the court trial didn't look real because people were all fanning themselves shows he has never spent time in the south in a public gathering place.

  This film is gauling and aggrivating, and unfortunately still very real.  While some call it old-fashioned, it is still much too true.  This is not a fun film, it is a great film, that speaks just as much to attitudes held today as it did then.",1165708800,11,3459,4.716917922948074

Patricia Johnson, nicknamed `Pinky' for obvious reasons, returns home after several years of studying nursing up north, where she was able to pass and live as white without the day-to-day prejudices.  Pinky's return is bittersweet when her mixed race is continually pointed out and used against her.  After nursing the dying Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore), she inherits her stateley mansion, but the will is contested forcing Pinky to endure a humiliating trial, where she is effectively fighting for her rights as a human being.  PINKY is a powerful study of human prejudice and greed, a remarkable film for it's time, and still stands up well today.

Jeanne Crain finally got the respect she deserved in Hollywood, with her portrayal of Pinky. One of Twentieth Century-Fox's main contract players, Crain had previously been cast in uncomplicated, one-note ingenue roles in films like ""State Fair"", ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" and ""Leave Her to Heaven"".  Crain was helped no end by talented director Elia Kazan in shaping and developing the demanding and, at times, gritty role of Pinky.  Playing Pinky's loving grandmother Dicey, Ethel Waters brings a quiet dignity and strength to every scene; and Ethel Barrymore adds a great deal of humour and heart to the misunderstood Em.  All three ladies were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances, but this is much much more than a ""women's picture"".  Nina Mae McKinney and William Lundigan (playing Pinky's white boyfriend) offer top supporting turns.

Walking about her Southern hometown, people on the street and in shops are heard to comment that she can almost pass for white. Of course the actress playing Pinky, Jeanne Crane, IS white! But since she's not supposed to be, the racism and prejudice she is confronted with seem more absurd than ever. One is reminded of the Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson from 1896 where Plessy, who appeared as white as ""Pinky"" but was classified as ""colored"" under the Louisiana code because he was one-eighth black, rode in the ""white"" rail car after making his mixed race known to the conductor. When he refused to move to the ""colored"" car, he was arrested, tried unsuccessfully to overturn the statute in Louisiana, ultimately taking his case to the Supreme Court of the United States. One-eighth black? What does that mean? What percentage of ""African"" blood is required to send a man to the back of a bus or get him arrested for sitting in a ""white only"" railcar? Of course this begs the even greater question - why should any human being be subjected to a different status solely based upon a distinction as insignificant as skin color? Jeanne Crane's performance, almost completely unblemished by emotion and depth of character, seems almost as out of place in this film as believability is in the convoluted script. Still, this film does have a lot to merit a watch, albeit a Timex and not a Rolex! The obvious problems with the film notwithstanding, they do add an interesting degree of relevance, intentional or not, to the subject. The central theme, ""What's rational about prejudice"" deals with the absurdity of a ""color"" conscious society to begin with, and Crane being so obviously white, draws attention to the irrational behavior of those pointlessly prejudiced against her.",1139356800,6,1944,4.876132930513595
565289,5,6303102492,"Pinky's approach to miscegenation and its story of a light-skinned black woman ""passing"" for white may be dated (the film doesn't even talk about Pinky's parents, presumably the miscegenated relationship that lead to her birth in the first place) and probably even offensive to some, but despite the film's flawed racial politics, it still works and entertains thanks to a trio of great perfomances (all Oscar-nominated) by Jeanne Crain, Ethel Waters, and Ethel Barrymore.  Sure, Jeanne Crain is white, but to expect the casting of a light-skinned black actress (like Lena Horne) in the lead role of a ""prestige"" 1949 Hollywood film is anachronistic (unless it had been an ""all-black"" film like ""Cabin in the Sky"" or ""Stormy Weather"").  And, although director Elia Kazan didn't think too much of her as an actress, Crain is very effective in the lead.  In fact, the whole ""white passing for black passing for white"" situation works well to point out the film's racial politics.

565294,3,6303102492,"""Pinky"" is one of those old-fashioned ""issues"" movies popular in the 1940s, such as ""Gentlemen's Agreement,"" which tackled anti-semitism (of note, both of these films were directed by the great Elia Kazan).  Unfortunately, these movies don't tend to age particularly well, and even the sympathetic characters often end up looking quite intolerant.  However, we shouldn't dismiss these films summarily, as they obviously had an impact on their audience.

Jeanne Crain stars as the title character, a young black woman raised by her grandmother.  Granny (Ethel Waters) is a poor, uneducated Southern washer-woman - the kind of good-hearted woman who cares for sick neighbors without compensation.  When Pinky was a child, Granny saved every penny she could and sent Pinky up north to go to school and escape the harsh life of segregated Alabama.  Pinky is so light-skinned, though, that she begins to ""pass"" as white; when she returns to Alabama, she has a white fianc and has been living as a white nurse.

Pinky is shocked by her return to the South and suddenly being treated as a second-class citizen again.  Further conflict occurs when Granny asks Pinky to tend to a sick white neighbor - Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore) who lives in a giant, slave-era colonial mansion.  Pinky has memories of Miss Em treating her and the other black children poorly.  Not surprisingly, Pinky refuses to tend to the racist Miss Em, but when Granny insists, an unlikely bond forms between Miss Em and Pinky.  Unfortunately, the plot is awkwardly handled, and the final conflicts are resolved unrealistically.

To a modern audience, this movie certainly doesn't offer any answers regarding racial relations; however, the historical perspective is of interest and the acting is fairly good.  A behind-the-scenes drama helps illustrate the status of blacks in 1949 Hollywood - Lena Horne, who was a major star, wanted to play ""Pinky,"" but the producers were not willing to incur the controversy of having a love scene between a black actress and a white actor.  Thus, the white actress Jeanne Crain received the role, as well as a later Oscar nomination.  Overall, ""Pinky"" is a decent 1940s drama of added interest for its history.  I enjoyed the film, despite its being outdated and somewhat creaky.",1106438400,52,2278,5.067024128686327
565295,3,6303102492,"Pinky shows the conflicted views of a black woman passing as white. We see her search for some identity while she is torn between the world of blacks and her heritage and the world of whites, those who persecute her ancestors. However; the film was a bit dull. There was an overall lack of action, and the ending was abrupt and poorly constructed. The ideas behind the movie were good, but the plot was almost too simple, and her internal conflict was resolved too quickly. They also neglected to show her lasting emotions for Tom, and it is unrealistic to think that she could drop contact with Tom so quickly and recover so well.",1038873600,6,631,4.543859649122807
