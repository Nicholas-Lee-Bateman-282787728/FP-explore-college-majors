7583701,5,B019TNIZNM,"Cathe Friedrich is one of my absolute favorite DVD instructors, and this new ICE Series is a really fun set!  It's meant to be an intermediate program (the full name is Intermediate Conditioning Extreme), but you can easily make it an advanced program by upping your weights and adding more energy to the cardio moves.

Although this set is billed as intermediate, it is *not* low-impact. One of the disks (Low Impact Sweat) contains two low-impact workouts, but everything else does have some impact to it.  That being said, this is the first Cathe series where there is a modifier (Amanda from Cathe's previous workouts), and you can definitely take the routines down a notch if you need to.

Some other things that Cathe does to make this more intermediate are:  she talks/explains things more between moves so have more down time, she includes moves like incline push-ups that are easier to do, and she uses moves designed to help you build up your strength (like in the Chiseled Upper Body workout, she has you do triceps push-ups on your knees and also includes a move designed to help you build up enough strength to do regular push-ups on your toes).

On each disk, you'll find the main workout, along with Blizzard Blasts that are meant to be add-on cardio segments to move you from an intermediate stage to an advanced stage in your workouts.  Additionally, each disk has a weight segment on it called a Muscle Meltdown segment.  Each DVD also includes at least one of the two Icy Core segments.

This set comes with the following seven workouts:

*  Rock'm Sock'm Kickbox --  a cardio workout that has punching and kicking drills; includes Muscle Meltdown Triceps

*  Boot Camp Circuit -- has sixty-second intervals of cardio, upper body, lower body and then core; includes Muscle Meltdown Biceps

*  Low Impact Sweat -- this DVD has two different routines, one that uses the step and one that doesn't; includes Muscle Meltdown Back

*  Metabolic Total Body -- hits the major muscle groups and has a strong cardio factor; includes Muscle Meltdown Chest

*  To The Mat: Legs & Glutes -- this is an all-mat leg workout; also includes Muscle Meltdown Shoulders

*  Chiseled Upper Body -- an upper body strength workout; doesn't include any Muscle Meltdowns since it's already a weight workout, but does include both Icy Core workouts

*  Chiseled Lower Body Blast -- lower body and cardio workout; includes Muscle Meltdown Shoulders (which is also on To the Mat)

The weight segments are all super sets.  Cathe basically has you do three rounds of five different exercises per muscle group, and you do each exercise for twelve reps.  For example, the Muscle Meltdown Biceps section includes these exercises:

* Standing Curl -- 12 reps
* Standing Hammer Curl  -- 12 reps
* Preacher Curl  -- 12 reps
* Incline Hammer Curl -- 12 reps
* Concentration Curl -- 12 reps

After doing one round of those five exercises, you take a short break, and then repeat the entire set twice more.  By the time you're done doing 180 reps, your muscles will be shaking!

Also be warned that this whole series is very shoulder-intensive.  If you have bad shoulders, you might want to steer clear of it.

One of the negatives about Cathe's workouts is that they tend to use a lot of equipment, and this one is the same.  To do the workouts as intended, you'll need a step with three risers on each side, a mat, a stability ball, and dumbbells in various sizes.  (For this series, you don't need a barbell.)

Also, Cathe's newer series no longer come with a printed User's Guide, but you can dowload it for free on Cathe's website, so be sure to do that since it includes workout cards where you can log the weights you use for each exercise.  The User's Guide also comes with three different rotations that just use the ICE Series, along with a few that incorporate Cathe's Low Impact series, the Ripped with HIIT series, and the XTrain series.

I'm just starting my third week of one of the all-ICE rotations, and I've loved every workout so far!  To the Mat is one of my faves since I love mat-work for my hourglass shape, and Cathe has never done a workout like this one.

In each workout, Cathe puts her own spin on more traditional exercises, so everything feels fresh and fun.  This is a fun, effective series, and I can tell that I'm tightening up!",1452038400,18,4341,4.641732283464567
7583702,5,B019TNIZNM,"I pre-ordered this set from Cathe's website and received it recently.  It is a great set!  Not only suitable for intermediate exercisers, but also for the ""advanced"" beginner.  There are also extra add-on workouts (blasts) for the more advanced exercisers.  The variety of workouts is huge and the pre-mixes are so many, it is hard not to find a workout that wouldn't suit everybody.  If you go to Cathe.com, you can watch previews of each of the 7 DVD.  Highly recommended bundle!!",1451779200,11,482,4.817073170731708

7583704,5,B019TNIZNM,"i am slowly working my way through this set, i am pretty much a beginner, in my current strength and capabilities,  im not new to lifting weights just been dealing with a frozen shoulder for the last 3 yrs, and thought cathe's intermediate workouts should help me slowly build back up to  being fit, oh my gosh, im using 2 lbs,3lbs,and 5 lbs. and im sore every day. im new to cathe's workouts and i have to say i love them, i love the music though on some of the workouts the music is almost louder than her voice which i don't love.but otherwise this set is going to do just what i had hoped, motivate me daily to workout and be challenged all the time. i used to do the original firm workouts but i just don't love them anymore. cathe is more motivating to me for sure.  i am using essentrics workouts in between these dvd's for a break and more stretching and a different way of toning. its working so well . very happy with this purchase.",1471219200,9,942,4.222222222222222

7583709,5,B019TNIZNM,"I've always done DVD workouts at home, specifically The Firm (which I love). I decided to try Cathe because her workouts looked intense, structured, and effective. I AM IN LOVE with Cathe, and this ICE series. I'm officially a loyal Cathlete and will be adding (lots more) to my collection!

This series is fantastic. No chance of boredom!  You'll be sweating, your heart rate will be way up there, you'll be seeing results, and you'll enjoy all of it!  :)",1459296000,7,456,4.675
7583710,5,B019TNIZNM,I am loving this series!  Wow!  The variety of workouts is outstanding and the moves are definitely unique.  Cathe is so inspiring.  I love the mixes on each DVD--just hundreds of workout possibilities.,1458691200,3,202,5.03030303030303
7583711,5,B019TNIZNM,"I recently quit my health club.  I just got tired of paying almost $100 it.  I had used Cathe's dvd workouts before and liked them, so thought I would give them a shot, so I ordered this set.  I've done the lower body and kickboxing so far and love them.  Cathe is an awesome instructor, and queues so well.  The workouts are as good, if not better than I get in a health club.  I would consider these intermediate workouts, but as others have said, you can make them easier or harder by lessening, or upping your intensity/weights.  Highly recommend!!",1456185600,3,552,4.46
7583712,5,B019TNIZNM,"This series is billed as intermediate conditioning extreme.  I felt this series was more advanced, although there are lots of things you can do to make it less intense or even more intense, if you are so inclined.  You can go heavier on your weights, you can jump more, and you can make the movements more dramatic.

The set backdrop is the New York City skyline.

A few things to note about this series:

*Amanda is supposedly the modifier in the workouts, but she didn't do much modifying.  Cathe gives some verbal modifications, but it would have been better if Amanda had really modified the entire time.
* As usual, Cathe rarely works on the beat.  This is a real problem for me since I find working to the beat helps me to push myself harder.  Oh well, this is Cathe, take it or leave it.  I did enjoy the workouts so much; it didn't bother me as much in this series.

The workouts:
Rockm Sockm Kickbox
Metabolic Total Body
Boot Camp Circuit
Low Impact Sweat
Chiseled Upper Body
Chiseled Lower Body Blast
To The Mat:  Legs & Glutes.

Each workout also has a Muscle Meltdown, Blizzard Blast and an Icy Core Workout associated with it.  The muscle meltdowns work a single body part with 5 exercises done for 3 sets.  The Blizzard Blasts are 10-15 minute extra cardio/conditioning exercises.  They follow the theme of the workout, e.g. the blast on the Kickbox workout is kickbox inspired.

There are many premixes on each DVD as well, so there is something for everyone.  The rotations associated with ICE are varied as well:  3 levels of pure ICE, mix of ICE and Low Impact Series, mix of ICE with Xtrain and mix of ICE with Ripped with Hiit.  Once again there is something for everyone and every fitness level.

ROCKM SOCKM KICKBOX (47:59)
Equipment:  5 & 12 lb. dumbbells, step and mat.
Muscle Meltdown: Triceps
Blizzard: Kickbox-inspired moves
Outfits:  Teal tops with black bottoms

The music was techno-music, which I normally find annoying, but I was enjoying the workout so much that it didn't bother me.

The workout consists of a punching combo, followed by a lower body and upper body blast, and then some recovery moves. There isn't a lot of impact in this workout.

Some of the moves include:  upper, body shot, elbow strike; lunge knee up, side to side agitate with knee up.

I couldn't match Cathes weight for the triceps.

METABOLIC TOTAL BODY (47:53)
Equipment: 5, 8, 10, 12 & 15 lb. dumbbells, step and mat
Muscle Meltdown: Chest
Outfits: Hot pink tops with black bottoms

Some fun, new exercises include:
Figure 8 arms with front lunge
Dynamic front lunge with lat raise
Squat thrust with 5 lb weights
Squat jab with 5 lb weights.

The Chest Meltdown uses 12 pound weights, which surprisingly, I found to be too light.

The Blizzard Blast continued with the theme of metabolic training.  There are lots of burpees and squat thrusts so be forewarned.

BOOT CAMP CIRCUIT (44:41)
Equipment:  5, 8, 10, 12 & 15 lb. dumbbells, step (2-3 risers), mat and stability ball.
Muscle Meltdown: Biceps
Outfits: Dark coral tops with medium blue bottoms

For me, this was the hardest workout in the series.  It was so hard in fact that I don't have the energy to do the Blizzard at the end.  I couldn't match Cathes weights on the upper body sections.  My heart rate was elevated the entire time.

Cathe says Amanda is the modifier, but Amanda was using the same step height as Cathe for the entire workout. A better modification would have been to have Amanda use a lower step height for the entire workout.

The warm up is a basic step moves on a step with 2 risers per side.  The routine is several rounds of cardio, lower body, upper body and core work.

Some fun, new exercises include:  Sumo squat turning, single arm swimmer plank, 1 arm burpees on the step.  For some of the bicep and shoulder exercises, you do a lot of reps and then freeze in a holding pattern.  Talk about ouch!

The Blizzard was tough; it consists of jumping off and on to the step.  The step is set with 3 risers per side.

LOW IMPACT SWEAT (46:13)
Equipment: 3, 5, 12, & 20 lb. dumbbells, step, mat stretch band
Muscle Meltdown: Back
Outfits: Bright yellow tops and black or blue bottoms

Cardio 1:

Some fun, new exercises include:
Discus throw with 3 lb. dumbbell
Forward leaning lunge with 3 lb. dumbbell

Even though this was low impact, my heart was pumping!

Cardio 2:

Cathe uses a step with 2 risers for this.  Who says that low impact can't be high intensity!  My heart was pumping, but my joints were happy.

I had to go down in weights for the back muscle meltdown, especially for the pullovers.

The 10 minute Blizzard Blast used a step with 2 risers.  Cathe threw in some old favorites like jump kick and salute squats.

CHISELED UPPER BODY (41:54)
Equipment: 3, 5, 8 & 10 lb. dumbbells, mat, stretch band
The two Icey Core workouts are included, but no muscle meltdown or Blizzard.
Outfits:  Coral tops and black bottoms

Some of the moves in this workout include:  swinging with a military press, windmills, rear delt raise with leg extension.  You do both standing and floor work.

CHISELED LOWER BODY BLAST (48:01)
Equipment: 5, 8, 10, 12 & 15 lb. dumbbells, mat, stretch band
Muscle meltdown: Shoulders
Blizzard:  More of weighted exercises with cardio blasts.  In a word, ouch!  Doing a 1 legged burpee says it all.
Outfits:  blue tops with black or black/blue bottoms

This workout consists of bodyweight or weighted exercises, followed by a cardio blast.  This one felt to be more intermediate level than the other ICE workouts.  Perhaps thats because my legs are so strong.  Amanda did several modifications in this workout.

In spite of feeling intermediate, my heart rate got up there.  At the end of the workout I felt worked out, yet energized.

Some of the fun, new moves in this workout include:  lunge front and back with no weights, high rep lunge leg taps, sumo lunge jumps, lift squat abduction and lunge with figure 8 arms.  I really felt my leg muscles burn with all of the moves.

TO THE MAT:  LEGS & GLUTES
Equipment: 5, 10 & 12 lb. dumbbells, mat loop, stretch band and stability ball
Outfits: Pink and purple tops with black bottoms.

This workout reminded me of Tracey Effingers Squeeze Series, which I happen to love.

Some fun new moves include:  pivoting childs pose with plank.",1452124800,32,6309,4.605760576057606

8746019,5,B019TNIZNM,"I have many, many Cathe Friedrich DVDs but don't reach for many often as they have a definite dread factor for me (I consider myself a high intermediate/low advanced level). These DVDs are a reasonable length, most 45 to 50 minutes, and the variety is wonderful with the ice blasts and muscle meltdowns. This is definitely worth a splurge for those looking to increase your fitness level.",1491782400,2,388,4.8059701492537314

8746022,5,B019TNIZNM,"I am 64 and not dead in spite of following most of the first two rotation levels, a month each. I get through the workouts with minor breaks and an occasional rewind to catch a missed instruction. This is good because I never could follow her earlier dancy videos. I recognize some some of her moves from other videos. Anni's Fierce Force is excellent for similar combos of weights and aerobics. Gin Miller's Intense Moves for interval step cardio is excellent also. I am hoping by the end of the ICE third level rotation I will have established a habit of exercising (it's been an off and on hobby). You know the jump and heel click they do in old movies? I can do that now.",1485475200,3,675,4.365079365079365
8746023,5,B019TNIZNM,"This is an awesome series that meets me right where I'm at!  I've been away from exercise for several months so advanced workouts were too daunting!  Ice challenges me and gives me tons of room to grow and advance without seeming too much all at once.  Love, love, love it!",1484956800,,273,4.42
8746024,5,B019TNIZNM,"Back in the day, I was a big Cathe fan and I used her workouts frequently, but the advanced nature of them led me to burn out over time.  I was an intermediate exerciser trying to do workouts that were beyond my level and eventually petered out and moved away from her workouts.

Because I haven't used her DVDs in years, this series was not on my radar when it first came out.  I took a chance and ordered the entire series after reading reviews.  I am very pleased with this series.  It is intermediate as advertised but there are options to make it harder if you choose.  Cathe has included a modifier in this series in Amanda, who does a nice job showing lower intensity options which I really appreciate.  I don't care for impact moves and they bother my back and hip as well.  These workouts fit the bill and I am pleased as punch that Cathe created this series!

I think Cathe is one of the best instructors out there but many of her workouts are difficult and advanced.  There are lots of reps, high impact and for me many of them are just plain hard and create a dread factor.  These workouts challenge you but don't wipe you out, plus they are fun.  There are tons of options with this series as well.  There are the 7 workouts, plus Blizzard Blasts which are add ons that up the intensity, Icy Core segments, and Muscle Meltdowns for each muscle group.  Not to mention the boatloads of premixes that are included, there are so many options with this series which makes it extremely versatile.

The 7 workouts include Metabolic Total Body, Bootcamp, Low Impact Sweat, Chiseled Upper Body, Chiseled Lower Body, Rock M Sock M Kickbox, and To The Mat Legs and Glutes.  While I have owned many of Cathe's workouts over the years, I have never purchased a complete series.  I am really enjoying working out with her again and I feel that she created this series just for people like me.

Thank you Cathe, 5 stars for this one.",1479513600,13,1931,4.422096317280453
8746025,5,B019TNIZNM,"The music is great and the workouts are effective. This is a well-designed program ideal for intermediate to advanced exercisers. The choreography is not too complicated and easy to follow. For beginners, use less weight and modify with lower impact options. For advanced exercisers, just increase your weight and/or add on the blast sections. I love advanced choreography and complicated movements, typically; however, this is a nice change of pace and allows for increasing weight and focusing on proper form. I thoroughly have enjoyed these workouts! By far, my favorites are the Rock'm Sock'm, Metabolic Total Body, and Chiseled Lower Body. However, they are all very well designed.",1478131200,4,686,5.361111111111111
