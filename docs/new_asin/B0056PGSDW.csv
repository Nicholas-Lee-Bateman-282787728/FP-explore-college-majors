8459851,5,B0056PGSDW,"This is a DVD that is many, many things. The photography/cinematography is beautifully put together and really, just stunning. The documentarians put their time and research in to the project and got some of the best marine scientists in the world. I contend that, like me, people just DON'T KNOW about what goes on at marine parks; I cant imagine watching this DVD and continuing to support the industry.",1346112000,,405,4.884057971014493

Mazel Tov and Congratulations to Theresa Demarest and her talented team on this accomplishment. I dearly hope everyone alive watches this movie -- for the whales' sakes.",1337212800,,361,5.464285714285714

Theresa Demarest and her team have created a wonderful DVD of the true story of what happened to Keiko, the famous orca, captured at a very young age and held in captivity for making the film, Free Willy. A wonderful mix of real footage of Keiko and interviews from those that took care of this orca. Also an especially wonderful tool to educate young people about how to treat marine animals (& others) in captivity and how we are all interconnected. A must see for all ages!",1313020800,6,578,4.732673267326732
