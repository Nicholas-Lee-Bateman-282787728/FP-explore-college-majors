8340778,5,B001T6KW5C,"The concert video is a fairly tired out way of presenting a band, but this is no ordinary video, and Rush is no ordinary band. Spare me the ""Blue-ray isn't video"" comments... I'm not here to write about the technical features of this BD. Rush is one of the few bands that not only sounds very much like a studio band playing live, they actually play their studio work note for note, with some very cool embellishments. Much has been said about the amazing way this trio creates such a gigantic, complex and present sound, and this BD captures it perfectly. The balance between the band and the crowd is handled very well... the crowd is always there, but the musicianship is never overshadowed by the crowd noise. (Yes, on ""Rush in Rio"" the crowd is over the top, and that is wonderful on that DVD). ""S&A Live"" is a musician's BD, and I echo several other reviewers here who wonder why more top acts haven't taken advantage of true HD recording. I'm sure this BD will help show how it's done.

As for the band itself... they are brought right into your living room. I am viewing this BD on the most basic of set-ups... a simple Blue-ray player connected with HDMI cable to a 50"" Panasonic Viera 1080P TV. That's all. TV speakers... no surround system, no monster subwoofers, nothing to make my neighbors burn my place down... and... it sounds great. There is no distortion, no muddy feeling, nothing that takes away from the band at all. The shots from above Neil's drums are wonderful, as are the various close-ups of all three members. The pan shots are effective at tying the whole presentation together, and as is the case with HD, there is nothing lost from close to distant filming.

As a parting salvo - there are a few people who apparently feel Rush is ""too old"" or has ""lost their edge"". This band is neither. They have been together something like 40 years and they still sound amazing. Yes, Geddy's voice is different than when he was shrieking ""2112"" and so on... and it does sound a bit strange to hear him in falsetto as opposed to a scream, but it works. As for Rush having lost their edge... this band can do literally anything on stage, and this BD proves it. They haven't lost a step... actually, they sound and look re-energized, and it was very nice in several audience shots to see the new, younger fan base they are now connecting with after all these years.",1281052800,,2381,4.496535796766744
