502123,5,6302706122,What a great movie and scintillating photography.  The story is simple yet captivating and the ending leaves you breathless.  Future looks bright for the young director and the cast of this movie.  Everyone should check it out.,1048809600,,227,5.081081081081081
502124,5,6302706122,"This movie starts out a bit wierdly. And the opening scene is just downright bad in which the acting and photography are quite ordinary. But very soon the whole thing goes into another plane. The acting and photography and story and jokes are better than most Hollwyood movies. The music and photography especially sometimes took me out of this world. I couldn't believe some of the ways they photographed the film.
The boy in the movie has a lot of charisma. But the story of the teacher appealed to me much more. She is a bitter person. But we really get to feel for her. And by the end her world is turned upside down by the boy.
In the final scene, during every beat I could associate totally with the teacher. My girlfriend was crying by the end. And I was trying to hold my tears back as much as possible because I was dogging this film to her when it started.
They advertise this movie as a boy like girl thing or a movie on Dyslexia. I think this will keep many people back from seeing the movie. I think it's much more than that. This movie is about our faith in people and humanity.",1048723200,,1092,4.280193236714976
502125,5,6302706122,"I saw this movie at the New York Independent Film Festival and it totally lives up to its billing.....the pace is good, refreshingly the message is spared from being overkilled and Genius has to have one of the best endings to a film that I have ever seen....totally unexpected",1048723200,,277,4.673469387755102

The very beginning is a bit slow, but the movie picks up hard within fifteen minutes, the middle is gripping when the teacher starts discovering his dyslexia and we get to know more about the teacher, and yes, yes, the ending is pretty amazing.

502127,5,6302706122,I caught this film at the New York Independent Film Festival last year and remember it as being one of the best films there.  It deals intelligently and honestly with a story of an inner city kid with a learning disability without lecturing us about the problem.  The film is entertaining and unpredictable while remaining educational and thought provoking.  A good buy.,1048464000,2,370,4.935483870967742
502128,5,6302706122,"This is the kind of film that is made all too infrequently these days.  Really good actors, who don't look like movie stars and are completely believable, even the bit parts are played to a tee.  My faves: the charismatic teenagers who are colorful enough to have their own sitcom.  Stunning cinematography of New York's upper east side harkens back to the great Woody Allen films ""Annie Hall"" and ""Mighty Aphrodite"".  A clear and simple story that hides a nice twist, and a great message (I'm not giving it away).  I don't think it's a film for real little kids, or gen-y'ers looking for sex and violence, but for everyone else, its one of those experiences that makes you feel better about the world, and better about yourself.",1048464000,5,729,4.6640625

502132,3,6302706122,"Both STROKE OF GENIUS and IN A PLAIN PAPER WRAPPER are both from the third season. SOG places Kimble in the ironic circumstance of being accused of a murder when the circumstantial evidence points to him. He is caught by the police who call in Gerard, but Gerard has to convince them that Kimble is innocent of that killing so they can release him to his custody for extradition to Indiana. Gerard tells the police that Kimble has never used deadly force to avoid capture. As he says this, you can almost feel the inner tension within his cop soul as he is merely repeating what Kimble's defenders have been saying all along. This episode is one of several that place the dramatic focus more on Gerard's evolving view of Kimble than on Kimble's own freedom. IN A PLAIN PAPER WRAPPER is one of several episodes that feature Lois Nettleton in different roles as Kimble's romantic interest. Here she plays a waitress who likes Kimble but their relation is complicated when she is asked to care for an orphaned nephew who soon spots his real identity. The plain paper wrapper of the title is a reference to the wrapping that accompanies a mail-order rifle that the nephew uses against Kimble. IAPPW is an ordinary episode that does not even generate much threat to Kimble since the boy does not reveal his identity, leaving Kimble free to leave town unhurriedly. Both episodes are typical of the vast majority that allow Kimble to run or hide but do not permit you to peek deeply into what makes him run. For that, I recommend NIGHTMARE AT NORTHOAK or LANDSCAPE WITH RUNNING FIGURES.",1026000000,,1579,4.663082437275985
502172,5,6302706122,"This is a segment of the award winning ""Masters of American Music"" series originally seen on PBS.  It includes documentary footage, rare performance clips and interviews with family and friends including Willie Nelson, Billy Joel, Dr. John, Billy Preston and Ray Charles, Jr.  Although running time is only 58 mns., the biographical information is comprehensive and performance clips are very entertaining.  It does not shy away from subjects like his addictions & surly personality.  I enjoyed this tape from start to finish. - M. Wright",1188691200,,538,5.294117647058823
502173,5,6302706122,"Patrick Dennis's ""Genius"" is a jolly romp, wildly improbable yet oddly convincing.  It is a much funnier book than ""Auntie Mame,"" with much more interesting character development.  I laughed till I cried in his description of the Mexican movie producer ""who lived under the sad delusion that toenails took care of themselves . . .""  Buy it, you'll like it.",1172188800,8,356,4.9
502174,5,6302706122,"Along with ""The Joyous Season"" this may be one of the best books by Patrick Dennis. Now, don't throw your copies of ""Auntie Mame"" at me, I defend that lady to my dying breath, but this book has a narrower topic and allows Dennis greater depth to skewer customs and mores of not one, but two countries.

In two other books, ""Little Me"" and ""First Lady"" he uses the broadest strokes to ridicule the foolish and stupid. This time we've a new set of the foolish and  the stupid, but they have the virtue of not-quite-being caricatures and having some semblance of  reality on their side. As is his custom, Dennis, this time with his wife, serves as the narrator telling a wildly amusing tale about a down and out movie director/producer trying to make a comeback. One may wonder, given the selected subject material, a come back to what but this is only the venue on which to layer interesting, funny, worldly people doing human, if mis-guided, things.

The dialogue is sharper, the social humor-always his greatest asset-more biting and more carefully examined. And the plot stays just close enough to the edge of reality to be plausible.

While the plot drives the book, it isn't much to worry about. Dennis' enormous ability to observer people and convey them is the story here. Imagine the greatest story teller you ever knew, over a Brandy by a roaring fires saying, ""Well, once upon a time in Mexico, we got involved in the most inane .....""

Oh, and keep an Ace bandage handy to bind up the ribs you'll break either laughing or falling down while laughing.",1159660800,10,1559,4.630434782608695
502175,4,6302706122,"Rightafter watching the film RAY, the book by Ray Charles w/ writer David Ritz, the albums i.e. GENIUS LOVES COMPANY, RAY SOUNDTRACK, MORE MUSIC FROM RAY, etc..., I knew this was gonna be a great, great documentary on the life of legendary Ray Charles known as the Genius of Soul, Brother Ray, Right Reverend Ray or Right Reverend, The High Priest of Soul, etc. To me, he was like a father, a brother and mentor/teacher that can teach me anything like in the early days that what if Duke, Count, Trane, Bird, Dizzy, Grover, Marvin Gaye and others were like teachers and fathers to me in the World of Music? How 'bout that?

I love every minute of this but includes some memories I can remember growing up back then in the early 1990s when he did the Diet Pepsi commercial w/ the Raeletts saying ""YOU GOT THE RIGHT 1, BABY!!!...UH HUH!"". I was 5,6 or 7 when that came out. Boy I gotta good memory.

RIP to the Man that left us a wonderful legacy that'll live on and still be there to this day like the legacies of Louis ""Satchmo"" Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Marvin Gaye, Miles Davis, Grover Washington, Barry White, Donny Hathaway, John Coltrane, 2Pac & Biggie, Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones, John Lennon, among others.

I'm blessed I catched this on Public Broadcasting 1 time. And it was pretty amazing plus it has writer and author David Ritz doing the talk about the artist. First time I heard him talk on the documentary.",1127952000,,1486,4.621212121212121

After the movie was finished everone got their money back and a complementary soda and the movie was banned from that theater. WASTE OF DVD PLASTIC AND INK. The money that paid for this movie should have been given to any kind of charity or homeless people. If you want to fux up your weekend invite peopel you don't like and watch it with them!

It is wonderful to see that the producers have taken time to think about and carefully lay out the story so visually. The story itself is touching and contemplative. Unfortunately the perfomances at times were just too ordinary, which prevents me from giving it a perfect five.",1055808000,,418,4.739726027397261
502181,5,6302706122,I've been DP on many student movies. And I can tell you I have no idea how the DP on this movie managed some of those camera angles. Technically the photography in this movie constantly pushes boundaries. The shots in the last scene are crazy! And the dolly-out shot - i would love to know how they did that. The whole movie is a good lesson for all apsiring DPs.,1052265600,2,363,4.2
502212,5,6302706122,"I saw this movie at Sedona International Film Festival on the opening night. A lot of people were amazed how they could have made it look so good with such a low budget. But don't be fooled. I work in movies. And there is no way this one was made for less than 10 million. They have special effects and dollies and extreme camera angles and each scene is shown from fifty views. And they shot on film, not video. That's expensive stuff. I liked the story and the whole set up for the ending. I thought the camera movements were totally in sync with emotional aspect of the movie. That's very very tough to pull off.",1052179200,2,615,4.264957264957265

502214,5,6302706122,"I can never understand why someone would want to make the effort to sit down and write a review. But this movie deserves it.
The acting is horrible. There are some nice moments but that's at it's best. But now this is the strange part - this is one of the most gorgeously photographed independent movies you will ever see. The opening scenes of Manhattan and the river have an intoxicating effect. Like if a hypnotist instantly says ""relax"". If you could paint images with a camera this is as close as you'd get. And the music is so soothing that if you closed your eyes for two hours you'd still enjoy the movie. I didn't know whether to hate this movie because of the acting or fall in love with it because of its beauty. I'm feeling generous today...",1051574400,,753,4.385714285714286

502216,5,6302706122,"I was amazed regarding the quality of this film, and very disappointed that the writer tried to incorporate some slapstick scenes just so that it would be more successful.
There are a couple of sad scenes, and that is what makes this movie so wonderful. Especially the final scene. It is just captivating on every level. And by the way I can't believe that the teacher calls him Stupid Kid, in the park scene.",1050451200,,409,4.54054054054054
502217,5,6302706122,"Classic storytelling. The lead character must

502218,5,6302706122,"I first viewed this at Sedona Film Festival after hearing about it on the radio. I saw the movie's importance in not only how it's possible to reach students, but also to expect the unexpected, and to never forget how powerful a role model a teacher is.

502219,5,6302706122,"THE best thing about this movie is the music. Who cares about the Photography or Special Effects. You can see those things in every movie in the theaters.
First up some of Loreena Mckennitt's best songs are in here and she's got something like 5 bestselling CDs out in the stores right now.
From the chillingly haunting opening scenes to the magnificent climax - it's driven every step of the way by the music. The only reason the photography and effects appear more breathtaking are because of this.
Then there are several pieces from Dagda's bestselling albums. One of the albums I already own myself - Celtic Trance. If that weren't mouth watering enough, the composer has done a good job to match the quality of the pieces in the movie.
Take away this collection of bestselling music and it's just another standard story. The only reason this movie has a recurring emotional impact is because of the high quality of the music.",1049760000,,930,4.711656441717792
502220,5,6302706122,"The scenes are gorgeous. And the rich coloring just eccentuates their beauty. The opening scenes and the final scenes are designed close to perfection.
The story as a whole and the music are pretty good. But the photography completely dominates this movie. It generates atmosphere and mood due to a widescreen feel, the unusual angles they're captured from, and the time of day they are shot. And with a cocktail of special effects thrown in, the last scene is nothing less than dazzling.",1049760000,,488,4.891566265060241

502260,5,6302706122,"A memorable line from a very solid story and great production.
This was probably the second or third best movie at the Sedona international film festival.
Genius is straight to the point, clear cut and keeps you on the edge of your seat from its beautifully photographed beginning to its spirited ending.
It is about a dignified black boy and the relationship he develops with his unlikeable teacher. But nothing is what it seems. Until the dramatic twist at the end.",1049587200,,467,4.777777777777778
502261,5,6302706122,"I found really interesting the way many of the scenes flowed with sexual inuendos especially when both the teacher and boy are wet in the fountain, or when he has her blindfolded inside the cab, or when they're in his home and he starts taking off his shirt.
That aside, this is a very thought out movie. Every word of dialogue counts. Every character is superb and I especially loved every moment the teacher becomes a slightly better person.
I have never seen Manhattan look so beautiful. The scenary is absolutely gorgeous.
Genius defies numerous stereotypes. And definitely packs an electric conclusion.",1049500800,2,607,4.96078431372549

Slowly she begins to realize the person she was and who she has become. Who is helping who and why who is helping whom is the big mystery which unravels into a bang of an ending.
This is a story of friendship and faith and small acts of kindness. Something like a modern day version of 'Pygmalion' with a twist.",1049500800,5,544,4.396039603960396
502263,5,6302706122,"Despite its slow pace in the beginning this movie is a classic 'how to write a first script'.
A senior in highschool can only date his dream girl if he becomes smart. The only person who can help him is his teacher with no self esteem for herself or respect for others.
A generic story with a fresh spin makes the premises of genius. Twists and turns are placed so that every time we anticipate a certain direction we're pitched a curve ball.
The locations are used cleverly. The same few locations are used again and again without us being aware of it. Every character has a specific purpose to the story. And they all play vital roles in influencing the two lead actors' character arcs. Special effects are used sparingly but at vital turning points in the story. The end twist may be original but we can almost expect something of this nature is going to hit us.
'El Mariachi' and 'Reservoir Dogs' are two must read scripts for all first time writers and producers. They show us how a good story can be told with minumum resources. This one falls in that category. The only trick these guys pull off is that they end up making their flick look like a stylish Hollywood movie.",1049328000,7,1178,4.458333333333333
502264,5,6302706122,"This story could have been told in one thousand and one ways. But they chose that one perfect way.
Although with occasional flaws in some respects, this movie was very well directed and acted. The elements of conflict were established early on, and the tension they created held me in their grip. The teacher plays the part of a troubled and depressed choco-holic who has given up on everything. But her quirkiness is somehow attractive. She doesn't care for those people around her or her students.  I loved this part because I'm sick of movies where the teacher has an infectoius passion for life and forces his students to learn poetry and this causes all their lives to improve.
Virtually every scene is embedded with symbolism. And many things that are said have a double meaning. Mike's final word, 'Ready', is brilliantly placed.
Mike seems like a normal hormone obsessed kid till very slowly his dyslexia starts getting revealed. But Mike's educated and rich dad refuses to accept that his son is 'disabled'. This is what creates the driving conflict of the movie.
The camera angles are exquisitely chosen. The same scene is shown from twenty different angles. Which almost made me feel like I was present with the characters and I absorbed the surroundings.
The standard goofy teen cameo subplot is interjected throughout.
And finally when we reach a satisfying conclusion something very incredible happens. Everything we believed. Every judgement we made about the characters and the story is flipped on its head. The final scene is what makes it worth the money. This one scene elevates the movie from good to excellent. And leaves you thinking for a long time.",1049241600,5,1672,4.929078014184397

Genius is beautifully photographed. And has some worthwhile special effects. One special effect right at the end when the camera rockets back about half a mile is dazzling.
The story is about a highschooler who likes this cute girl. But she only goes for boys who know their economics! So the highschooler forces his moody teacher to make him good at economics. Now this teacher is pretty messed up. And alot of this story is actually about how the teacher confronts her own demons.
The pace of the movie increases every ten minutes. And just when I thought the movie was over the best part starts. The ending of the movie is one of the best I have seen. It is emotionally a rollercoaster and the camera work is mind-blowing. The ending is similar to the 'Sixth Sense' except that Genius is more dramatic because of the music and fast paced photography.  Every person sitting on my row of the cinema was crying.
The funniest scenes are between the Scottish boy and Blondie. They have their own little subplot running throughout the movie about how Blondie keeps on getting slapped by a woman.
One particular aspect of the story which appeals to me personally is that the boy lives with his single dad. In contrast to the stereotypical kid living with single mum.
The story is told with subtlety, style and unpredicatbility.

This is about a director one step ahead of the IRS just so happens to pick an apartment that is owned by a woman who once starred in one of his movies.  Also living there is Patrick Dennis and his wife who the director, Leander Starr, has also stiffed.  I've never read a book by Mr. Dennis that I haven't enjoyed.  By the way, he also writes under the name ""Virginia Rowans"", and those books are just as amusing",1370908800,2,487,4.148936170212766
7830188,4,6302706122,"This is one of the four really funny novels that Patrick Dennis wrote, about an eccentric film director directing his latest art movie in Mexico.  It is probably a bit dated but is funny nevertheless.

Good for a light read.",1365033600,3,224,4.575
7830189,3,6302706122,"Although I am very familiar with the time and culture he sets this story in, I found the first third of the novel poorly written, far too wandering. When he embraces Starr and the social set, and the real movie making, he gets his teeth into it and his writing improves tremendously. The first third reads like a writer filling space, but it got so much better that I wished he'd gone back and sharpened the opening he'd tossed off. That said, the rest is hilarious, and a very true picture of the time and industry.",1295049600,2,516,4.385416666666667
7830190,5,6302706122,"Patrick Dennis' writing has such joy in it. It's a real place to take refuge in. I picked up a used copy of Genius last winter, and (*overshare alert*)it helped me survive during the worst, multi-day, stomach flu I'd ever had - or ever hope to have again.  When writing is THAT good and diverting that it allows you to forget you're in complete physical agony, THAT'S ""Genius,"" indeed.",1293926400,7,385,4.579710144927536
7830191,5,6302706122,"Hilarious, frequently savage comic novel about an American couple in Mexico who are forcibly befriended by Leander Starr, an expat American movie director -- clearly based on Orson Welles -- on the run from the IRS, more than one ex-wife, and his estranged daughter. Starr, egotistical, brilliant, and endlessly charming, contrives to put together an epic film of Mexican history, financed by a local drug lord and starring another ex, in hopes of salvaging his fortunes. Written with all Dennis's typical droll wit, this is a must for fans of Welles, who will recognize a cunning roman  clef of Welles's (mis)fortunes in the 50's and 60's.",1195516800,11,640,5.037735849056604
