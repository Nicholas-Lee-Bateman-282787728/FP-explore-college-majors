4933941,5,B0062VL4K6,"My son loves all his Chuck the Truck toys and we saw this movie at Wally World but for a lot more than they are selling it on Amazon. I did not realize this show is on HUB (a station I know not everyone gets), which we have but I don't like all the commercials. My kids love this DVD it has a catchy theme song that will get stuck in your head. If you have little ones who are fans of Chuck or the Cars movies this is one to check out.",1338249600,5,435,3.6881720430107525
4933942,5,B0062VL4K6,My Grandson asks to watch this DVD every single time he comes to visit!  It's quite a long movie consisting of a number of 30 minute episodes and there's a moral to each one.  I find him smiling and laughing out loud at some points.  I'm so glad I bought this for him!,1334361600,4,268,4.018867924528302

4933944,5,B0062VL4K6,"My boys are huge Chuck & Friends fans and this DVD is perfect for them.  With 10 episodes there is a lot of Chuck and Friends to enjoy.  I love that now only are the trucks fun and colorful they are also wholesome.  The episodes teach such great lessons such as working together, helping out friends in need, making decisions and accepting responsibility.  My boys love that there is a good variety of trucks, which is especially important since one of my boys is a construction truck lover and the other is a monster truck fan!  This DVD is perfect for any child and there isn't a show like Chuck & Friends!  My 5 year old actually just got a Chuck & Friends stunt playset for his birthday and he thinks its hilarious to play with it and watch this DVD!  You don't have to be a Chuck fan though to enjoy Chuck!",1328486400,8,811,4.261437908496732

4933968,5,B0062VL4K6,"This appeals to my son at 18 months and is a hit for my 4 year old nephew as well. Chuck the Truck is a little dorky but the episodes usually do have him trying to be a good friend or help someone out.  There is a little music in the beginning and occasionally a song in the middle for the younger kiddos. Also, the characters are most often a dump truck, a loader, garbage truck, firetruck, and tow truck so no matter what vehicle your little guy is into, they'll be present.",1407974400,2,476,4.118279569892473
