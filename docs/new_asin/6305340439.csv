1011059,4,6305340439,"This is a somewhat surreal Italian exploitation movie and although it does have a plot hidden within it, the emphasis is firmly upon the entertainment provided by each scene.  The exploitation theme is carried out with great enthusiasm with large amounts of nudity, lesbian themes, whipping and even a horny spider, but all somewhat harmlessly.  Visually, the movie is quite classy with good production values and this is a good quality print.  This is certainly much more watchable than many other exploitation movies dragged out of the vault for release on DVD in recent times.  Overall whilst this is no masterpiece, it does combine some good moments coherently with surreal elements and it all looks pretty into the bargain.  Collectors of this genre could do much worse than get hold of this, its well above average for this type of movie.",1111881600,14,844,4.957446808510638

1011061,4,6305340439,"The sight of a woman in white gown spread open, running full frontal through the woods has got to be a good sign, coming as it does in Nude For Satan's opening moments.
On his way to a house call, racing down the highway in his VW bug, Doctor William Benson nearly has an accident as he sees the woman in white standing in the middle of the road. As he is recovering from his near miss, he hears a crash behind him. He finds a Mini with the woman inside injured, presumably for the same reason as he. He puts Susan in his car and goes for help. Note: how did he know her name later? He didn't go through her purse or anything that I could see.
He finds a castle and enters. The place is a deserted and decrepit place. He sees a painting of a woman, then finds that woman rushing to greet him. To his surprise, it's none other than the woman he rescued, except she calls him Peter. She's also more carefree and happy, and she ends up seducing him. She also spouts some puzzling words on memory and time: ""What is memory but a fraction of time wrapped in the parentheses of the past?"" Wow, sounds like dialogue from Dr. Who, Colin Baker era. And also, ""The past is not in time anymore, and time is silence. There is no space here for memories--it's always now.""
Meanwhile, Susan, apparently recovered, goes to the castle, where she is invited in by a mysterious man in black. He welcomes her in but there's a sinister air about him, as he momentarily undresses her with a glance of his eyes. A hallucination or no? She sees a painting of a man who looks like William, except he's dressed in 19th century clothes. She runs into him, and he not only calls her Evelyn, but acts like a buffoon. What's happening should be kind of obvious by now, adding the woman's mysterious words, and those of a book William finds: ""The light is twofold, the way is only one. The essence of life is not in time. He who has made a pact with Him, belongs to Him.""
The mysterious stranger says some words about life that are intriguing and true: ""... an illusion, like life. We delude ourselves that we live, that we love, that we die. When we see our mistake, we prefer to ignore it. Then, everything becomes a nightmare."" A nightmare is exactly what William and Susan go through once they figure out what's going on.
There's whippings, lesbian sex, and enough full frontal nudity. Rita Calderoni (Susan/Evelyn) also played a dual role in The Reincarnation Of Isabel as Laureen/Isabella, and we see more of her here than in Isabel. If this didn't have the skin and violence, this would make a great Dr. Who story. As it is, it's a piece of weird but fascinating Euro-horror, more coherent than The Reincarnation Of Isabel, and with a good puzzle for the viewer to figure out.",1026345600,44,2753,4.37890625

There is a creepy feel to the proceedings which  is backed by a foreboding musical score, solid acting and stylistic use of  lighting and camera movements.  It's very low-budget and the narrative is  minimal, but the film's shortcomings are redeemed by it's dream-like  ambience.

  The star, Rita Calderoni, is very attractive and quite nude in this movie. Hint: It's he 70's, lots of ""bushes"" in the scenery. Nobody ""mows the lawn or trims the bushes"" back then. It's nice to see 4 women topless women in a movie and none of them ""silicon"" enhanced. In fact if you watch closely one of Rita's breast hangs (Left) lower than the other.
  Of course for most reading this review Rita stopped being hot about 10 ti 15 years before you were born. Actually this is a piece of mindless entertainment with quite a bit of female nudity, a couple of lesbian implying scenes (With no hard-core sex) and no real plot.
  It's a harmless waste of time without anyone debasing themselves in supposed real life like crappy reality TV. For most guys, who could ask for more.

1011312,3,6305340439,"My rating is based solely on the pleasure I derive in campy movies...
I know you've been waiting with bated breath for my unbiased review of ""Nude for Satan,"" available on Amazon Prime in HD. So, without further ado...

Rarely does a cinematic feature hold such promise from the opening scene. A young, nubile young woman comes running (in slow motion) from an unknown terror, clad only in her gossamer negligee. Pert breasts slowly bouncing with every terrified step; 1970s bush on full display You know the horror shes running from is the stuff of nightmares.

The scene changes to a doctor, driving heedless through a dark and stormy night to answer the urgent call of duty. He happens upon a woman who has come to some tragic, yet survivable, misfortune on the side of the road. Knowing that she is helpless, he decides to seek refuge and help at the gothic castle nearby. He forces his way in when no one heeds his appeals and encounters countless oddities as he roams the home. From a laughing man with a knife protruding from his neck, to a couple knocking boots (and more bare breasts) to a woman who seemingly climbs from a mirror to seduce him. The woman, in an astounding plot twist, is the same one that he found by the side of the road.

Seemingly the next morning, the injured girl makes her way to the same house. She meets a mysterious man with piercing eyes that see her at her most vulnerable (translationnaked). Her dapper host invites her to stay indefinitely, or until she can find her Good Samaritan from the night before. She ignores her unease at the strangely provocative hostand good thing too, or wed miss random naked women bathing scenes & strange internal dialogues. Oh, and some girl on girl action too. Really, a terrifying plot.
 Through some loose writing and disassociate states, it comes to light thats there two dopplegangers roaming the castleboth eerily resembling the two new inhabitants of the castle. Throw in some maniacal laughing, more prolonged girl on girl scenes and a devil with piercing eyes and the ability to make you unable to resist his will and you have a horror movie that deserves the title, Golden. As in, 14 carat crap.",1445904000,2,2178,4.678851174934726

That, and I'll eat my hat if the model on the cover is Rita Calderoni.  The point is that Redemption films is trying to be a little sneaky here, and I don't know why they feel they should.  The movie is what it is, and it's going to have its fans as well as those who think the whole thing is goofy crap, but the cover isn't going to move anyone from one camp to the other.  The only reason for substituting the cover image is to fool someone into buying it who might be turned off by film stills that are obviously from a 1970's film.

Not much of a plot here, but that's probably secondary.  Two travelers, a man and a woman who previously did not know each other, find themselves prisoners of a demonic force inhabiting an ancient castle after experiencing a car wreck on a nearby road.  While confined, they meet doubles of themselves, doubles who have none of the inhibitions of their originals.  Exactly why these doubles exist, or what the motives are behind the mysterious man who embodies the supernatural force are never really explained.  The motives of the director are pretty plain though; to squeeze in as much nudity and orgiastic behavior as possible.

I've never been especially keen on artsy-porn, ala Jess Franco, although admittedly I've not seen enough of it to completely write off the genre.  Still, that's what Nude for Satan most reminds me of, and it didn't work for me this time.  Rita Calderoni is certainly attractive enough to look at for the duration of the film, with or without her clothes, so the movie has that going for it, but otherwise, there's very little to cover the story's nakedness.  Evidently there is another version of this film, a hardcore XXX version which used body doubles for the main characters.  I can actually see more reasons for that version than this one, due to the paperthin plot.  In fact, now that I think about it, the edited version does in fact look exactly like a porn film with all the porn removed, albeit with the nudity left in.
