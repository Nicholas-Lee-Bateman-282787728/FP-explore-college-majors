7545047,2,B018ELUDJO,"This DVD is a lazily produced collection of Bowie interviews strung together with no context (no dates, locations, or names are given). The video quality is forgivable considering the age of most of the broadcast source material, but the inconsistent audio levels between interview clips is inexcusable. You'll be riding your volume level to avoid blowing out a speaker. Other than the clips which are presented back to back, there is a menu screen with a photo of Bowie and a ""chapter selection"" menu with a still from each clip. Again, no info is given pertaining to each chapter. The interview content with Bowie is, of course, fantastic and mostly insightful but there this nothing here you can't find for free via YouTube. I hope David Bowie's estate is getting a piece of this, otherwise this is a distasteful cash-in by the production company. This was a huge missed opportunity to put together something truly special to honor the legacy of the brilliant timeless artist, David Bowie.",1455235200,64,992,4.946107784431137

7545050,3,B018ELUDJO,"Although I could watch David say about anything for 90 minutes, this is a collection of promo interviews, mostly from the same promo tours for Heathen and Reality, and then slapped together.  There are some nice moments when Bowie gets snarky with the interviewers as his patience of being more intelligent than them grows on his nerves or he is obviously bored/tired from doing the same interviews over and over again.  In the end though, not a lot new is learned and the repetition gets tedious.  There are other more informative and entertaining Bowie DVDs out there.",1465516800,,570,4.855670103092783
7545051,2,B018ELUDJO,"This is an awful video, the production quality is absolutely terrible.  Audio doesn't match from segment to segment; segments are not in a logical order, etc.  All segments are widely available online anyway.

7545058,5,B018ELUDJO,Loved this DVD. Many of these I'd viewed on YouTube at one time or another but love having it Ina collection. I wish I could scoop up all those interviews on multiple DVDs and just listen to him forever.  It's worth the price in my opinion because it's Bowie talking however dull witted some of the interviewers are... He preservers.  Something I will watch many times again and can share with others.  I recommend it to Bowie fans,1462924800,,431,4.5

7545068,5,B018ELUDJO,"A mixed bag of reviews for this Bowie DVD compilation of what I fee are worthwhile and interesting interviews. They show the man for what he is and get inside his thought patterns pretty well. I recomnd this to fans or to those who would like to see how his maverick performer and musician ticked.
Theres a similar film now available on Frank Zappa too",1459036800,,352,4.430769230769231

7545076,4,B018ELUDJO,"If you are Bowie fan, this is worth it! The content is great. You'll find some hard to find interview footage here. Production quality was not the greatest.

7545079,1,B018ELUDJO,"I adore David Bowie, so following his death when I was targeted to preorder this new ""documentary"" DVD, I jumped at the chance.  I waited nearly a month for it to arrive, and now I know why:  I.V. Media hadn't yet made this DVD when I ordered it, which is really just a compilation of all the interviews he's given through the years that you find on YouTube.  Verbatim.  Save your $10 and go watch these same clips on YouTube.",1456876800,19,426,4.2875
7545080,4,B018ELUDJO,Low production value on the wrapping of the interviews - dates would have been super useful - but the interviews themselves were exquisitely selected. Each one reveals fascinating details about Bowie as an artist and as a person.,1456790400,3,229,5.052631578947368

This seems like a poorly put together product made to cash in. Don't waste your money. Just watch all Bowie videos online.",1456531200,11,261,4.458333333333333
7545093,1,B018ELUDJO,"This DVD is absolutely lousy produced and the missing of any detailed credits and content information makes me doubt about its legality. Sure it's nice to listen to David Bowie, that's why I bought it, but the quality how this product was done  is a disgrace to the artistic level and high standards of the artist.",1456444800,3,314,4.607142857142857
7545094,5,B018ELUDJO,"David Bowie: The man who sold the Words

By

Rob Jones

The groundbreaking terrain of David Bowie covers an infinite distance that stretches out to a Life on Mars and beyond in to other galaxies. This colossal cultural chameleon is the most durable, diligent, diverse deity of modern music. The wand of Bowie has cast its spell over a smorgasbord of sound spheres; and, the rest of the field can at best only play second fiddle to the influence of the greatest of Heroes.
Bowie has set standards and broken boundaries that step outside of his aural art-and, this sonic scientist has been an astute student of his craft and the endeavour of those on the margins.
The DVD: David Bowie in his own Words (Interviews and Contributions) unites a collage on conversations with the Starman to the fore. The 70s Berlin years have Bowie in full flow discussing his liaisons with Brian Eno, Robert Fripp and Iggy Pop as well as supporting new acts and at this time he tips a relatively unknown but obviously alternative Devo for recognition.
The discussions display confidence but also modesty-and despite being an idol he pushes this accolade to one side claiming that his goal is just to work. He also shies away from an immense impact upon his followers and states that the most important person in each individual life is the one that stares back at us in the mirror. There is intensity within his thought process but he is also prone to levity and that comes across in abundance.
January 2016 marked our farewell to David Bowie but his Golden Years have touched countless performers and punters. Please watch this recording and marvel at the maestro who fell to earth.",1456444800,,1662,4.724137931034483
7545095,1,B018ELUDJO,"Well....looking at a recent release date and not getting any description of this DVD, I had hoped and somewhat assumed there would be some recent footage of David. It contains several interviews over earlier days. But they were hap-hazzardly thrown together. Pieces of one interview in Japan was split up here and there. There was also no introductory ANYTHING, just started right off during an interview. Most of all these have been seen before. This is a very disappointing video. Don't bother purchasing, that's my opinion.",1456272000,2,526,5.127906976744186
7545096,4,B018ELUDJO,"Love David Bowie and I enjoy watching the interviews. Through hard work anybody can change themselves on any given day and that is the message I got from this.
I would have wished that at least dates were added and a little more info on which interviews we were watching. Given the release date a month after his death and at the end of the video it says 2013. I wonder if he had this tucked away for some time in order to persue as many things as he could to leave us with as many things as he did.",1455926400,2,499,4.0
7545097,3,B018ELUDJO,"This has a few interviews, mostly from  either the late '70's or early 2000's. They are just all played one after the other, not even any titles as to when or where they are from or who they are with. I've seen most of them, incompletely, on YouTube. I am disappointed as this could have been really spectacular, I'm glad it wasn't more money. I love Bowie more than anything, been a fan for so long so I don't mind it owning these interviews now, but really wish there was more to it.",1455840000,8,485,4.21505376344086
7545098,5,B018ELUDJO,"A lot of those interviews are in bits and pieces on the net, but here you have them all. A must for the Bowie fan. My only complaint: need more interview footage, there's never enough Bowie :)",1455667200,2,192,4.216216216216216
7545099,5,B018ELUDJO,"David Bowie is arguably my favorite musician/artist. After his passing I watched every interview I could find on YouTube. Some of those videos are on this DVD. The quality is poor because they are primarily older television interviews. Some really good interviews from his earlier years did not make this DVD and that is a shame but what is on the DVD will be a treat for any Bowie fan. The man was brilliant in my opinion. I don't think I could ever tire of seeing him interviewed, watching his mind work. David Bowie has been a role model for me since 1974. For that reason alone this is a valuable keepsake.",1455580800,9,610,4.455357142857143
7545100,1,B018ELUDJO,"This DVD was such a disappointment! It's just a series of terribly put together interviews, with no mention of who is interviewing him or when. This thing looks like someone downloaded a few bad quality interviews from YouTube and burned them onto a DVD. Terrible. Save your money and watch these interviews on YouTube!",1455321600,42,319,4.925925925925926
7545101,3,B018ELUDJO,"It's always interesting to hear Bowie talk, but you end up understanding why celebrities loathe press junkets, because of repeated (and sometimes insipid) questions. There are interesting threads that come up (he never had a permanent home, he produced Devo's first album, etc.), but there is no effort here to put any of those threads together. It literally is a random series of interviews, not even ordered chronologically.

Give me a weekend to rip these interviews off YouTube, categorize the questions, and I could piece together a narrative that gives you some insight into his thoughts. That's not what this is. This is not a documentary; it's a YouTube playlist. The only thing that makes it watchable is Bowie's good humor and interesting point-of-view.",1455321600,32,763,5.153225806451613
