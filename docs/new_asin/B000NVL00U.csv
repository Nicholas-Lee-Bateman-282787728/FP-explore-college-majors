8181686,1,B000NVL00U,"Mediocre through and through.

The only question in my mind was: ""How could someone like Serge Avedikian or Simon Abkarian sign up for this after reading the screenplay?!""

Aside from being a complete artistic failure, this film has the potential to give the uninitiated viewer an absolutely idiotic notion of Armenia and Armenians. For this alone, the director should be shot using a gun of a particularly large caliber.

The only watchable parts of the DVD are the deleted scenes without any dialogue.",1237420800,,503,5.036144578313253
