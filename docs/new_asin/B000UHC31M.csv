8213290,4,B000UHC31M,I admit that I originally only wanted to watch this movie because of it's historical 'location' scenes in 1953 Mexico City.  It does not disappoint in this direction (but  many scenes were in very obscure - non tourist areas).  There are some funny/some poignant scenes but not enough character depth in the main characters.  It is the secondary cast members that really add the juice to the story.  I think the fired streetcar employee who acts as a 'squealer' in the last third of the movie was the best rounded and sympathetic of the lot.  This is only the second Mexican movie I have ever watched - and won't stop me from seeing more of what is out there!,1399161600,,659,4.495798319327731
8213291,3,B000UHC31M,"First and foremost, this review is for the Alters Collection edition (the one with Vive Mexico on the cover), and that edition DOES have English subtitles, though the subtitles are not very good.

Illusion Travels by Streetcar is one of the many quick and inexpensive films Luis Buuel made in Mexico in the 1950s; this one is a comedy about two mechanics who get drunk and borrow a trolley, only to encounter some difficulty in returning it. They have various odd and ironic adventures all over Mexico City while they avoid their superiors and try to sneak the streetcar back into its depot.

The films is competently made and contains surreal touches that will appeal to the director's fans, but it didn't strike me as a standout in Buuel's overall body of work, or even in just his Mexican period. It's episodic, rambling and light, and it lacks the depth and mystery of films like Los Olvidados and Nazarn. I should say, however, that a native Spanish-speaker might find more to enjoy in the film than I did; the subtitles seem to have been written by someone who was either very careless or not completely fluent in English, and so are probably only a vague approximation of what the characters are saying.

The picture quality was quite good.",1393459200,4,1247,4.7110091743119265
8213292,2,B000UHC31M,I regret that I cannot get full enjoyment from this movie because it does not have English subtitles. This was not clear in the advert.,1379116800,3,135,4.44
8213293,3,B000UHC31M,Screwball comedy that is unusual for Bunuel. Generally he is more serious. But it could be that I was expecting it too be serious. I will try seeing it again.,1369180800,,158,4.3
8213294,5,B000UHC31M,"A brilliant movie, hilarious comedy scenes, and for the tram enthusiast heaps of fantastic footage of trams going everywhere... the sound guy must have held the microphone down near the gearcase as the scenes are full of lovely 'tram music' as you hear the spur gears working hard.",1331856000,5,281,4.875
