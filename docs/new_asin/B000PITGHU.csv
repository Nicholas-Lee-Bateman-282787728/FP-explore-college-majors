2824043,3,B000PITGHU,"This video uses only visual, non-verbal instruction. Before each exercise is performed, a screen shot of a stick figure in the Asana (pose) along with the technical name of the Asana is shown, which I suppose makes up for the lack of verbal directions. The Asana's shown are all very basic.

I was only able to get about 8 minutes into this before I had to turn it off; the major problem for me being the tingy doorbell like noise that would play at both the beginning and end of a pose presumably as a cue to tell you to move on to the next Asana. Had this noise been the sound of an actual chime, or bell, or flute it would be fine, but it wasn't, so it might as well been nails on a chalk board ringing every 30-60 seconds.

If you can get past this particular noise (or watch it on mute as sound isn't really necessary), this could be very good for someone just starting out with a yoga practice,or someone who prefers a gentle style of yoga.

I guess I will have to watch the rest of the video on mute to see if the Asana's get more difficult.",1368576000,4,1048,4.127450980392157
2824044,3,B000PITGHU,"This tape came packaged nicely and on time. I do like the explanations, and demonstrations, they are very clear. I just wish that I would use it more often. I do get bored easily, so its not the tape its me. Some of the categories when you click on them they don't go to the right place. I would recommend this to someone with more patients.",1363737600,,341,4.181818181818182

8191908,4,B000PITGHU,"This is a great video if you want something very quiet -- you see a simple line drawing and the name of the asana, then the asana is demoed.  No extra talking or direction, but quiet and contemplative.  I liked it!",1447286400,,214,4.195121951219512
8191909,1,B000PITGHU,it made me want to blow my brains out -- a way-too-alternative and way-too-extreme solution to some relatively minor digestive problems.,1431216000,,136,5.523809523809524
8191910,5,B000PITGHU,"Really love this simple yoga program for home practice. No annoying instructor, just slow sustained stretches. After just a few sessions my chronic shoulder pain disappeared and my sleep improved. Realizing yoga doesn't haven't to be painful to be extremely effective.",1418515200,,268,5.560975609756097
8191911,1,B000PITGHU,It is  Very low quality and just plain awkward I would not recommend unless you like very low production quality videos,1390521600,,119,4.666666666666667
8191912,4,B000PITGHU,"I really like all the yoga videos in this series. However, if you're looking for glitz and high production value, you won't get it here. The ""instructors"" are wearing baggy sweat pants and pullover knit shirts; the woman's shirt is obviously about three sizes too big. There is no dialog, just demonstration. Before each asana, they show a stick figure representation of what it is supposed to look like. The music is the same thing repeated over and over with chimes to indicate the beginning of the pose and the end of the pose. Sounds dorky, right? Well, it kind of is. The reason I like these videos is because all of the focus is on the POSES not annoying chatter. Additionally, I feel like the poses used in each video really helps the problem they are supposed to be addressing. One word of caution, because there is no verbal instruction, you need to have a basic understanding of how yoga poses in general should be performed. For this reason, although the poses themselves aren't that difficult, I wouldn't recommend these videos for a beginner.",1389139200,2,1055,4.708108108108108
8191913,5,B000PITGHU,This so works. Everything lines up and somehow links together. If you are like me though sitting in verdasana may kill your feet choose a different position from time to time...until your body adjusts to ur weight. OH I LOVE THIS SERIES. KUDOS to Yogi Kumar.,1386374400,,258,4.630434782608695
8191914,3,B000PITGHU,What I liked about this is that there was no narration.  It is a good program for someone who has a basic understanding of the yoga postures.  The instructor shows the move while you listen to relaxing sounds; a gong announces when it is time to switch poses.  This allows you to focus your thoughts on breathing and being.,1383350400,,323,4.440677966101695
8191915,5,B000PITGHU,"I thought this was a great, meditative yoga video. I don't particularly like the non-stop talking of many yoga videos. The chime at the beginning and end of each pose allows you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing and the pose and to meditate, rather than on the TV. Each pose is held for at least a minute or two, so that you can really get the meditation and stretch. However, since there is no verbal instructions, it helps if you have prior yoga experience to watch this video.",1382486400,4,492,4.358695652173913
