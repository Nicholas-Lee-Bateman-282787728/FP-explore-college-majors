869591,5,6304429207,"Skip all that balderdash about Edward G. Robinson's 'Little Caesar"" as being ""iconic"", ""genre-defining"", or ""prototypical"".

It's a great movie, made about gangsters when that problem was a fresh, topical, current one. ""Ripped from the headlines"" is exactly the truth here.

Robinson's performance is flat-out one of the greats of cinema. His ""Rico"" lives and breathes on screen like few others from the early days of sound film.

Remember, this is a sweet little Jewish gentleman from Turkey, playing a mercurial, merciless Italian mobster.

You'd never know.

His rise from gas station robber to gangland king is, yes, the standard story you all know by heart. But I could not for a moment take my eyes off Rico. The cockiness, the menace, the desperation...the rat-tat-tat delivery of the lines mimicking the tommy gun sound so new to film during that era.

Douglas Fairbanks looks elegant in his role as the partner who wants to get out of the ""biz"". The other bad guys have great ""faces"" for their roles, but to be honest, most of them display a ""staginess"" or artificial quality that only makes Robinson more real, more alive.

The transfer does have some spots where it looks like a film from the 30's, but to be fair, there are many more reels that look pretty freaking sweet...just gorgeous, with crisp details and smooth grays.

The short (17 minute) doc does a great job of placing the film in a proper perspective, and fully enhances your appreciation for the film. The ""Warner Night At The Movies"" again is outstanding, with a newsreel featuring the girlfriend of the murdered gangster ""Legs"" Diamond, a nice short featuring a young Spencer Tracy,and a black & white cartoon that characterizes that time period. There's also a trailer for a film where Robinson doesn't play a gangster, which is kinda neat.

Five stars? For the DVD? Oh yeah...easy.",1108080000,4,1861,4.901273885350318

Little Caesar, that's who!"" in the iconic LITTLE CAESAR (1930).

869596,3,6304429207,"This film was a direct ideological intervention in the debate about prohibition, or exactly for the repealing of the famous amendment that had introduced prohibition. The argument was that prohibition gave gangsters a tremendous field of development and thriving. As such it was an important film. But nowadays it does not work at all on this level. The acting is cold and very stiff. The plot is reduced to a caricature of anything it deals with. It is definitely neither thrilling, not exciting, nor even entertaining. Too slow, too trite, too superficial. And, what's more, Little Caesar is no Al Capone. It is not with mediocre characters that we can make a great film. Note yet one important conclusion we can draw from the film: crime, for those mostly Italian poor immigrants, was a compensation for their poverty and alienation. The film tried to show that it was an illusion: one can start from the gutter and get to the top thanks to crime, but one will necessarily end up in the gutter again, and most of the time with a few slugs of lead in his flesh. The morality of the police guns that look after our welfare, even when the crime considered is created by an absurd constitutional and legislative decision.

869597,4,6304429207,"It is too easy to view LITTLE CAESAR and to laugh at the often caricatured voice of Edward G. Robinson as the small time hood who clawed a rapid rise to the top of Chicago's underworld only to tumble equally fast.  What the modern viewer may fail to grasp is that when LITTLE CAESAR was released in 1930 Robinson was no star and the gangster movie did not exist as a genre.  With his menacing voice and tough guy attitude, Robinson changed all that.  It is because of him that later cinema gangsters like Pacino and Brando could strut their stuff.
At the beginning of the film, Robinson is Rico Bandello, the 'Little Caesar.' He drifts into Chicago and invites himself as a member of the ruling gang.  Even then, with nothing but his gravitas and physical presence, he could take words that were meant to be conciliating and twist them into a snarl laden with menace.  What I found interesting was that whenever Robinson went face to face with an adversary, Robinson forced him to look down at his own diminutive height as if to say, 'Your size means nothing, fool.' It becomes soon clear that the mob boss will surrender his place through default.  Rico Bandello manages to cram into little more than an hour a case study in the ephemerality of the solitary gangster who relies more on his brutal personality than on some hired brains to run his criminal enterprise.
On a technical note, the sound track was at times incomprehensible, an excusable flaw since sound engineering had just begun the year before.  Further, the dialogue sounds incredibly cliched, but again, to the audience of 1930, Rico's words were jarringly original.  When a gasping, dying, Little Caesar spits out as a last snarl of defiance, 'Is this the end of Rico?', Edward G. could not have known that his ending of this gangster film was but the prologue of a series of crime movies that are as popular today as when Rico Bandello lay on a filthy street, shocking America with his surprisingly emotional epitaph.",1043452800,25,1986,4.670487106017192
869598,5,6304429207,"The rise and fall of a vicious gangster. This is the landmark film that launched the gangster movie cycle, a powerful movie that chronicled for the first time in talkies the sleazy and slick underworld, epitomised by a snarling and ambitious creature with no redeeming virtues, Robinson, in the role which was forever identified with him. Eddie is a dedicated killer and thief as seen from the very beginning of the film: viewing him over 6O years later, the viewer can't help but to wonder at his incredibly perceptive performance. Rico has a pseudo homosexual relationship with Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) and the scene where Rico pays an old harridan (Lucille LaVerne) practically his entire fortune to hide him out in a secret back room of her store is memorable: boy, does she take advantage of the situation! The ending line was originally ""Mother of God, is this the end of Rico?"" In order to soften the tone for American Bible belt audiences, the line was changed to ""Mother of mercy"". The film was a huge smash in it's day and films such as THE PUBLIC ENEMY, SMART MONEY, THE FINGER POINTS & SCARFACE were soon to follow.",1036972800,4,1139,4.728643216080402
869599,4,6304429207,"I had never seen a golden age gangster picture before so I decided to make a start with this one. I mainly rented it to see Douglas Fairbanks jr. (being a fan of Fairbanks Sr.'s silent films) I thoroughly enjoyed it.
A word of warning, this was made in 1930 and the sound cinema was still in it's infancy. Some of the acting is still between the mnore obvious emoting of silent cinema and the more subtle sound acting to come. Also, this was the start of a genre and so it is probably not as sleek as its successors.
That out of the way, this is the tale of the rise and fall of Rico (Edward G. Robinson) known as Little Caesar. A small time gunman who claws his way to the top of the mob and then tumbles from his throne. His downfall is caused, inadvertantly at first, by Joe (Fairbaks), his best friend from his small time hood days who became a nightclub preformer and wants to leave the mob behind.
Robinson chews up scenery as Rico and it is a joy to watch, in spite of sharing top billing, Fairbanks isn't in it all that much in the middle. Honorable mention goes to the actor who portrayed the head detective so well, he seemed to take almost satanic glee in catching crooks in their own egos.
Another sidepoint, Rico is not likable because he was never meant to be. Sure, his determination is interesting but underneath it all he is just a petty operator. This movie really has no hero (Joe is a bit weak and the detective is off his rocker in my opinion) and to have this in mind before watching will keep things enjoyable.",1005264000,17,1533,4.2714776632302405

Robinson was an unlikely star, and this was  the film that put him on the map.  His performance as Rico is never boring,  although it has little subtlety (which usually works for the character).  The story is well structured, chronicling his rise and fall.  But the lack  of a musical score (typical for an early sound film when they were still  learning about the medium) is noticeable, and the pacing is off.  The main  character of Rico is pretty unlikeable, which affects viewer involvement in  the movie.

870140,4,6304429207,"As a critic, its important to sometimes put a film within its proper historical context when thinking about a review; for example, reviewing the original THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL after viewing the more technologically advanced AVATAR might make the 1951 picture seem like small potatoes.  For its time, EARTH STOOD STILL was equally impressive, and it compelled audiences to think not so much about how they might live their lives as what their lives meant to a greater community, sentiments not lost on folks living in those early days of the Cold War.

Similarly, Mervyn LeRoys LITTLE CAESAR may not seem as stylistically impactful as, say, the films of Martin Scorsese.  Its important to bear in mind that CAESAR did what it did as a practical first in filmdom: it brought the big city gangster to big, bold, cinematic life right near the end of the Roaring Twenties  when big city gangsters still walked those big city streets.

If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at things to come, then read on )

From the product packaging: Edward G. Robinson embodies the classic screen gangster in this tale of the rise and fall of Enrico Little Caesar Bandello, a hardened criminal with few attachments, fewer friends and no sense of diplomacy.

Well, he may have no sense of diplomacy but what Rico had  compliments of Robinson  was screen charisma, so much so that even the actor realized this was a performance that would inevitably follow him around throughout most of his film career.  Of all of the characters in LITTLE CAESAR, the only one who is interesting  even if to a fault  is Rico; the other characters are drawn to his magnetism in a way that makes this picture work on the highest level.  Sadly, when Rico is relegated to the background or completely absent (as happens with any story), I felt CAESAR just wasn't all that captivating.  Naturally, this isn't meant as an insult to the other talent; rather, I think it just speaks to the weaknesses of the script.

Given the fact that this was the first real big screen treatment afforded to the life and times of the urban ganglord, perhaps Francis Edward Faragohs adaptation of the W.M. Burnett novel only wanted to give legitimate flesh and blood to the central character of Rico.  In fact, I can say that later films exploring similar themes polished out some of this weakness by giving the big guy at least an intellectual equal or a cunning moll on his arm if for no other reason than to give him someone to verbally spar with or against.  CAESAR tries to have that, largely in the form of Ricos thug-world friend Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), but as Joes on his way out of the crime business hes no real edge with which to combat the gangster.

As a result, CAESAR plays out more faithful as a twisted rags-to-riches-to-rags again tale, only differentiated by its inherent novelty (the first in a series of gangster pics) and Robinsons dynamism in the lead.  When hes on-screen, hes clearly in command  and that even serves to make audiences care about the big lug when he falls mightily in the pictures last reel.

Film scholar Richard Jewell provides  at best  an interesting commentary track for those wanting to know just a wee bit more, but his high points are covered (to a lesser degree)  in Leonard Maltins four-minute introduction to the film.  So why listen to an academic for the entire 80 minutes if you don't have to?  Most of his insights are his thoughts on why a particular scene was shot a particular way, and its only backed up by his understand of film requirements of that age and not any studio memo or directors or producers notes.  He does occasionally offer up some juicy tidbits from having read the actual shooting script, comparing that to what ended up on the silver screen  but, as the film wears on, he says less and less, apparently content to let the motion picture speak for itself.

RECOMMENDED largely for fans of gangster cinema, Edward G. Robinson, and Warner Bros. classic cinema, LITTLE CAESAR certainly set the mold for so many of the crime pictures that would follow from the studio, though I honestly found any sequence in this picture not involving Robinsons Rico to be pretty pass.  And  for the record  theres surprisingly little crime in so renowned a gangster classic; in fact, if it looked this easy back then, Im surprised there wasn't a bunch of moviegoers inspired to give a life of crime a second look based on CAESARs simplicity.  Still, the bad guy falls hard in the end, and theres always a lesson learned in that.",1421712000,,4839,4.7134363852556485

870674,3,6304429207,"Little Caesar is a good example of a film that is historically important but which has dated very poorly. The camera work, by cinematographer Tony Gaudio, is mediocre, the spare soundtrack, by Erno Rapee, is garbled, and the acting very wooden. Even Edward G. Robinson, who became a star in this role, is merely ok. What makes this all the more amazing is that, just a few months later, in 1931, Jimmy Cagney would burst on to the screen with The Public Enemy, a film that holds up cinematically- technically and aesthetically- far better. Directed by Mervyn LeRoy, and written by Francis Edward Faragoh and Robert N. Lee, adapted from a novel by W.R. Burnett, the 78 minute, black and white film, limps along, despite being nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award. So unsure of its narrative power is the film that, like its silent era cousins, it makes extensive use of intertitle cards to convey plot points quickly, and also obscure the narrative fact of its indeterminate chronology.

  That's because there is a general awkwardness to this film that many early talky pictures had, and the acting style is unconvincing. There are scenes which simply make little sense, diegetically or not, and clank along in stereotypes. Aside form The Public Enemy, and the Paul Muni vehicle, Scarface: The Shame Of A Nation, one might also compare it to German Director Fritz Lang's film M, released the same year, which made a star of Peter Lorre, another rather un-movie star-like movie star. In that film, Lorre plays a pedophile child killer done in by a trial brought by local gangsters, enraged that his killings have brought the wrath of the cops down upon them.

Made in the 30's, it has you rooting for the bad guy Little Caesar known as Rico, played by Edward G. Robinson in this pivotal movie on the century. Actors like James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, even all the way up to Al Pacino and even Johnny Depp in the newest Public Enemies movie would all fall under Edward G.

870678,4,6304429207,"Little Caesar (Mervyn LeRoy, 1931)

There can be no denying that the gangster film has come a long, long way since 1931 when a fledgling director of cheesecake named Mervyn LeRoy took an aspiring star named Edward G. Robinson and top-billed him over one of the biggest names of the time, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and made movie magic. It's been almost eighty years since Little Caesar, and the formula has been honed, honed, and honed again, to the point where a gangster movie is considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made (and The Godfather will probably continue to top polls long after you and I are gone). But if you've never seen it, you've gotta go back and watch Little Caesar. When a genre has become so well-defined and has had so many classics come from it, going back to the roots can often be a disappointing exercise at best. Not here.

Robinson, acting in his ninth film (and the first in which he received top billing), plays the title character, though he doesn't gain that title for a while. As we open, his name is Rico, and as he was in most of his movies until that time, he was an ambitious, if somewhat crude, gangster. He starts off working for Sam Vettori (Riders of the Purple Sage's Stanley Fields), but he's too much of a loose cannon. (""A million people in this city and you had to knock off the Crime Commissioner?"") Vettori cuts him loose, and Rico sets up shop on his own, drawing the ire of every other crime family in town. Rico, Joe Massara (Fairbanks), and Otero (The Man with the Golden Arm's George E. Stone) are on the rise--but this is 1931, and the message is that crime doesn't pay. (Not that the message had changed by 1982, when the Scarface remake took in uncounted millions.)

It's short (clocking in at just seventy-nine minutes), it's somewhat predictable given the time it was made, and I haven't come across a print that doesn't scream for restoration. But that kind of lends it an air of authenticity; this is a grimy little tale, why shouldn't the celluloid be scratchy? But here, LeRoy showed he could do more than movies like Naughty Baby and Oh Kay! (not, I rush to add, that there's anything wrong with pre-code cheesecake; I adore it), Robinson showed he had the potential to be star material (and Fairbanks was gracious enough to let Robinson have the spotlight), and the script, adapted by Frances Faragoh (with help from Robert Lord and Darryl Zanuck) from W. R. Burnett's novel, sparkles. You think The Godfather is a quotable movie? Well, it is, but watch Little Caesar. This is the kind of dialogue that talkies were made for, and lines from it will trip off your tongue for days afterwards.

And somehow I just talked myself into giving it a higher rating than I originally had. ****",1271289600,,2760,4.569696969696969

870680,4,6304429207,"This movie was based on W. R. Burnett's controversial 20's novel of Chicago's gangland. Transferred to the screen, it became Edward G. Robinson's defining role, and with good reason. He does a great acting job as the brash and brazen gangster Rico (Little Caesar) Bandero. This character is of course patterned after Al Capone.

What might be less obvious is that, either intentionally or coincidentally, the character of Rico's early partner in crime, Joe Massara, parallels the life of actor George Raft. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., plays Massara. This character wants to be a dancer, but finds it dangerously difficult to quit his gang affiliations with Little Caesar. In real life, George Raft started his entertainment career as a dancer, then went on to be typecast as a film gangster. You can see that Fairbanks is still finding his way on screen. But he does an adequate job as the criminal not cut out for the job.

However, another actor who, along with Robinson, turns in a compelling performance in this 1930 movie, is Thomas Jackson who plays Sergeant Flaherty, the ever-present policeman dogging Little Caesar with cynicism and a sneer, assuring him of his eventual downfall. George Stone (who later became Boston Blackie's perennial sidekick, ""The Runt"") also does a wonderful turn as Little Caesar's sidekick here.

The plot might seem straightforward, but there are subtleties I missed. Richard Jewell, film historian, points out some of these sly elisions in his commentary. For example, when you watch the film, you might want to take note of what happens to the diamond stickpin we first see being worn by the Northside boss who argues with Little Caesar and who jockeys for position with him.

As interesting as it is to see this prototype of Warner Brothers gangster films - Jewell's commentary is even more interesting. The bonus features on this DVD are worth the price of the disc alone. You'll learn a lot about the early film industry. I really didn't find this early talkie distractingly creaky, although in a few places you can see the actors fighting against the necessary stage blocking of the scenes, trying to work their ways into earshot of the nearest microphones without seeming to crowd each other. It has always amazed me how in nine short years, cinematic technology went from these early, often constricted black-and-white offerings to the full-sweep Technicolor sagas of ""Gone With the Wind.""

You'll also learn about the creative ways these early moviemakers had of sidestepping any likely censorship problems. Little Caesar's original signature line was uttered by Robinson as ""Mother of God, is this the end of Rico?"" However producers worried that such a line might offend more religious moviegoers and draw fire, so in most of the prints of the film, the line was amended to, ""Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?""

Thanks to this classic portrayal though, there will never really be an end to Little Caesar. He'll go down as the eternal gangster who can take it as well as dish it out.",1264291200,,3033,4.948919449901768

Better than its contemporary The Public Enemy (though not as good as 1932's Scarface), Little Caesar is a simple story of a gangster's rise and fall, but Edward G. Robinson is very good as Rico and it clocks in at a lean 79 minutes; within a few years filmmaking advanced so far (picture 1949's White Heat) that uncomplicated movies like this seem almost quaint by comparison, but it's still a decent film.

Thanks for making it possible",1242950400,,320,4.245901639344262
870873,5,6304429207,"Little Caesar has lots of action, drama and suspense all packed into a tight, well edited 78 minutes that you won't forget anytime soon! We get great performances by Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Glenda Farrell, just to name a few. The plot moves along at a very good pace and I was never once bored. The cinematography was very well done; the choreography works well in crowd scenes and the scenes near the end of the picture. This is one film that's truly going to remain a classic!

When the action starts, we quickly meet small time crooks ""Rico"" (Edward G. Robinson) and his buddy Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.). They both yearn to go to ""the big city"" where they can move up in the gangster world, although Joe also has ideas about becoming a professional dancer. ""Rico"" will hear nothing of this: he wants to make it big in organized crime and he wants Joe to be in the crime syndicate with him.

Once they get to Chicago, things work out remarkably well for ""Rico"" and Joe, although as time passes Joe becomes more and more enchanted with his girlfriend Olga (Glenda Farrell) who is also his dancing partner at The Bronze Peacock. ""Rico"" even starts moving in on his boss Sam Vettori (Stanley Fields) to take control of his boss' territory; and inevitably ""Rico"" pulls this off. It's about this same time that ""Rico"" forces Joe to take part in a planned robbery of the very nightclub where Joe works with Olga--The Bronze Peacock. Naturally, things can't always go the way ""Rico"" plans them; and Chicago Crime Commissioner Alvin McClure (Landers Stevens) is killed by ""Rico"" during the robbery. ""Rico"" even has his eyes on the territory of ""Little"" Arnie Lorch (Maurice Black).

The heat is on; but with some clever timing and a little bit of luck ""Rico"" keeps on climbing the ladder to become more and more powerful in the world of organized crime. He eventually takes over the entire North side of Chicago, which used to be the territory of the much-feared Pete Montana (Ralph Ince).

Although things may look rosy for ""Rico"" at this point, I left out a few things to keep you interested when you watch this--and I do think you should watch this; it's an excellent film. How will ""Rico"" ever get Joe Massara to rejoin the mob and not become an informant to the cops? What about Olga--when ""Rico"" tells Joe to call it off with Olga, how will her decision change things for them all? What about others who want to get a piece of the action in the North side of Chicago--will that be a problem for ""Rico?"" Watch and find out!

The DVD comes with a few bonus features; I especially liked the short bonus entitled ""End of Rico, Beginning of the Antihero."" There is also an optional commentary by film historian Richard Jewell.

Little Caesar is a truly classic gangster film with so much good acting it's incredible; I didn't think the film suffered much from the constraints of being an early ""talkie"" even though at times you could tell it wasn't exactly a recently released motion picture. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this movie; people who enjoy gangster films and classic movies will not be disappointed.",1239667200,,3165,4.632798573975045

Everything about the movie, including the DVD transfer (although a lot better than the VHS) is dated-looking and sounding, but that helps make it interesting. The dialog is so passe that it's almost weird. I put on the English subtitles so I could understand everything because the slang of those days is something foreign to us nowadays. The different expressions of the day are fun to hear (and read).

The acting by the man who plays the main cop is also strange, very wooden-like. He just didn't sound natural. Some of the other actors were likewise, others were fine. It was one of the early ""talkies"" so maybe things were still needed to be smoothed out, film-wise and acting-wise. In other words, some of the actors sounded professional and others amateurish.

The rise and fall of Rico is a very simple story. He gets to the top by stopping at nothing. His readiness to shoot to kill, almost for the fun of it, scares half the gangsters into submission, and inspires the devotion of the other half. That's the mechanics of his rise. The role of the mysterious Mr Big in the ultra-luxurious pad at the top of the heap is unexplained. Nothing is shown of bootlegging (Rico is teetotal --- until his fall: is there a message there?) or prostitution. There's a cheap early hold-up, followed by an extremely unsubtle cash raid on a night-joint. The protection racket means that Rico's predecessor can spend most of his time playing solitaire. He's too fat, dumb and lazy to keep his seat. Rico appears to have no interest at all in women, but he is vain; he seeks fame and publicity, and has a fatal weakness for his good-looking former gunsel, Douglas Fairbanks Junior, a ""sissy"" dancer under the thumb of his female partner. It's the explosive performance of Robinson that carries this picture, but also the vivid imagery of the trappings of gangsterhood: the ugly mugs, the hand-irons, the swell banqueting, the comically illiterate speechifying, and the even sweller gangster funeral procession, the sub-human dialogue, the long, low automobiles that scoot round street corners, the rat-ta-tat of the tommy guns drilling holes in china-shop windows and through hoardings.

This gang plans to knockover ""The Bronze Peacock"" and use Joe Massero as the insider front man. Sam Vitteri makes the plans, he alone is running the gang. McClure of the Crime Commission is celebrating New Year's Eve (in that place!). The robbery occurs when everyone is celebrating at midnight. Rico shoots McClure, who seems to be reaching for a gun. Now Boss Vitteri has a problem. Rico's personality ensures his promotion. He is ""all right"" for the rest of the gang. Tony wants to leave the gang, but only makes it to the church steps. Poor kid! They celebrate with a banquet for Rico. Newspaper reporters take his picture. [An omen of bad luck?]

Another gang decides to make a pre-emptive strike. Rico's luck holds; he decides to take over more responsibility when Arnie Lorch relocates to Detroit. When told his opponents are bigger men, Rico says ""the bigger they are the harder they fall"". Rico meets with the Big Boy and learns he will be given Pete Montana's territory. Will he meet this added responsibility? [Does this remind you of the feudal system? Noblesse d' epe.] There is a problem with some people and Rico tries and fails to tidy up this mess.

The police round up the Palermo gang and search for Rico, who escaped and went into hiding. [So who moved into this power vacuum?] A newspaper story upsets Rico and provokes him to make a call on the telephone; this is a fatal mistake.

871116,5,6304429207,"Along with the original ""Scarface,"" released by Howard Hughes one year later, LeRoy's ""Little Caesar"" summoned up the real-life exploits of Al Capone, who in the prior decade had virtually controlled Chicago through fear, violence, and huge illicit profits from bootlegging and vice operations. Actor Robinson, a refined soul in real life who'd considered becoming a rabbi, actually resembles Capone, but projects a menace all his own. This makes ""Little Caesar""--a landmark gangster film that made Robinson a star--still bone-chilling 75 years after its release.",1182297600,,563,5.635294117647059
871117,4,6304429207,"""Little Caesar"" was the first of the three movies that founded the gangster film as an art form during the age of sound. The other two were ""The Public Enemy"", released three months after Little Caesar, and 1932's ""Scarface"". The movie itself may only rate four stars, but it is Edward G. Robinson's performance that rates five stars.

The film starts out with a distance shot of a gas station robbery in which the attendant is gunned down. You see the lights in the station go out, you hear the shots, you see the getaway car speed away. You can guess the rest. Such a scene would have not been nearly as powerful before the advent of sound and helps establish the ruthless nature of Rico.  Later, Rico (Edward G. Robinson)  and his partner Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) are talking in a diner. Rico has designs on heading to the big city and getting in with a gang there. His partner is only interested in this life from the financial security angle, since he actually wants to go straight. Rico, though, believes in the gangster's version of the American dream and wants to climb to the top of the gangland power structure.

Although ""the big city"" is never named, it seems to be Chicago from the various neighborhoods mentioned. Once there, Rico joins up with Sam Vettori's gang. Joe, however, is more interested in being an exhibition  dancer at a local night spot, although he ""moonlights"" as a gangster just for the extra money and perhaps out of the habit of doing Rico's bidding. At first Rico seems content to take orders from Sam, but he is just biding his time. Once he realizes that Sam is weak he takes over his gang. Rico quickly climbs through the ranks until he is at the top of the criminal heap. Rico is interested only in power and status. To Rico, the money is important mainly as a symbol of this status.  Rico has only one ""soft spot"" - his fondness for Joe. When he can't bring himself to shoot Joe to keep him from talking, Rico finds himself on the run and his fall is precipitous. His violent end comes when his overblown pride won't allow him to leave a local police chief's bragging to the newspapers about Rico's downfall to go unanswered. Ironically, and somewhat too coincidental to be believable, Rico is gunned down behind a sign advertising one of Joe's upcoming performances.

Strangely enough, there isn't even that much direct violence in this film and absolutely no mention of prohibition. ""Little Caesar"" would probably not be so well remembered if it was not for Edward G. Robinson's star-making performance. Dialogue had not yet reached a very sophisticated level at this point in talking pictures, yet Robinson artfully portrays a ruthless gangster for which power and status are everything through his gestures and expressions.

Richard Jewell, who does the commentary on this film, does an excellent job of analyzing both the film itself and Robinson's performance inside and out. Also, there is a classic short, a newsreel, and a cartoon along with some other extras that I've come to expect from Warner's superb DVD renditions of their classic movies.",1178236800,,3104,4.735185185185185
871118,4,6304429207,"I really enjoy them old timey gangster films, and while Little Caesar (1931) isn't one of my absolute favorites (I've always been partial to the James Cagney features), it's still a damn good picture and worthy of the attention it has gotten over the years.  Based on a novel by W.R. Burnett and directed by Mervyn LeRoy (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, Little Women, No Time for Sergeants), the film stars Edward G. Robinson, `the best actor never to win an Oscar', at least while alive (Bullets or Ballots, Scarlet Street, Key Largo) in one of his earliest `talkie' features.  Also appearing is Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (The Prisoner of Zenda, Gunga Din), Stanley Fields (Destry Rides Again, Island of Lost Souls), Thomas E. Jackson (The Woman in the Window), Glenda Farrell (Gold Diggers of 1937), George E. Stone (Some Like It Hot), Maurice Black (The Front Page), Ralph Ince (The Sea Wolf), and Sidney Blackmer (Rosemary's Baby).

As the film begins we see a couple of small time mugs knocking over a filling station, eventually winding up at a diner where we meet them proper...there's Caesar Enrico Bandello (Robinson), also known as Rico, and Joe Massara (Fairbanks Jr.).  Tired of small timing it, Rico decides they should head east to Chicago, as that's where the action is, ultimately joining up with a gang lead by a local hood named Sam Vettori (Fields).  While Rico's got his eyes on the prize (moving onward and upward), Joe seeks to extricate himself from the life by taking a gig as a dancer at a club named The Bronze Peacock.  Vettori gets word from his boss Diamond Pete Montana (Ince) to cool it on the rough stuff as the new crime commissioner is cracking down hard.  Vettori and his boys, being criminals and such, can't sit still for long and end up knocking over The Bronze Peacock (using a reluctant Joe as the inside man), which leads to power struggle and Rico taking charge.  After tying up some loose ends, Rico's notoriety grows, drawing the attention of not only his peers, but also law enforcement officials (one in particular name Flaherty, played by Jackson).  A failed attempt on Rico's life leads to him horning in on even more territory, so much so he's given rule over the entire North Side by Big Boy (Blackmer) himself (seriously, there's a character named `Big Boy' in this film), but is that enough?  Nah...why settle for the frosting when you can take the cake?  Eventually Rico's meteoric rise to power reaches its apex, leading to his inevitable downfall, triggered by a past event and an old loyalty.

If you're not familiar with old timey gangster films then some of the lingo used within this film may sound strange upon hearing it, so I'm going to provide some definitions, as best I can, to help you along...

Gat - A term used extensively throughout this film, it refers to a gun, most generally the hand held variety.

Rod - Another term used within the film, it, too, refers to a handgun.

(just a note, some other terms used within the genre, but not here, are heater, popper, cannon, piece, persuader, peashooter, thirty-eight - this refers to the caliber of the gun, ordinance, artillery, and so on)

Chopper - A machine gun, sometimes referred to as a `tommy' gun, derived from its full name of Thompson submachine gun.

Bird - I've always thought this a term for a woman, but gangsters will use it in reference to each other, most common when a boss is talking to a group of henchmen...here's an example, ""You birds need to lie low for awhile, until the heat dies down.""

Heat - When gangster talk about heat, most likely they're referring to increased pressure in general from the authorities that might be cracking down on criminal activity.  Generally this term is used after a big score or a hit.

Score - A robbery.

Hit - An assassination.

Mug - A term sometimes used to reference associates, or just people in general...""You mugs really rub me the wrong way.""

Moll - Girlfriend of a gangster.

Torpedo - A professional thug or assassin.

Yellow - This is what you call someone if you really want to disrespect them as it's the same as calling them a lowly, gutless, sniveling coward...""Yer as yellow as the day is long!""  Gangsters really seem to take offence to this so use it with care.

I really enjoyed this film and while it's not my favorite gangster feature, it's definitely a classic.  There's no mistaking Edward G. Robinson owns this picture, as the ruthless, swaggering, self-made, contemptuous, opportunistic lead character never content with his lot in life...the more he gets, the more he wants, so much so he eschews anything (alcohol, women, personal relationships) that might get in the way (ultimately one, or more, of these three contribute to his inevitable downfall).  My favorite scene happens right after Rico and his cohorts hold up the nightclub.  Robinson's character, who's just plugged a mug, jumps in an awaiting getaway car and tells the driver to floor it.  The driver, being a real nervous Nellie, has trouble with the manual transmission, and gets a wallop upside the head so hard from Rico I felt it from my chair.  The other performers do well (I particularly liked the sardonic, low-key character of Sergeant Flaherty), providing support for Robinson.  One bit I thought odd was the amount of attention given to the character of Tony Passa, who ended up being a weak link in Rico's gang (guess what happens to him).  There's a scene with him and his mother I thought unnecessary as she talks about what a wonderful boy he was, just before Rico catches up to him.  All in all I thought the story tight, the pacing even and strong, the direction capable, all making for an entertaining and enjoyable experience.

The picture on this Warner Brothers DVD release, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), looks decent for a film that's seventy plus years old.  There is some unevenness in the quality at times, but I think it's unrealistic to expect a pristine transfer given the age of the original elements.  The audio, presented in Dolby Digital stereo, comes through well.  As far as extras, there's bit called Leonard Maltin's Night at the Movies, which includes an introduction by Maltin, a trailer for a film called Five Star Final (1931), a newsreel of the day, a short feature called The Hard Guy (1930), starring Spencer Tracy, a cartoon titled Lady, Play your Mandolin (1931), and a trailer for Little Caesar.  Also included is a featurette titled Little Caesar: End of Rico, Beginning of the Antihero (17:05), a 1954 re-release introduction (0:42), a commentary track with film historian Richard B. Jewell, and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.  One really minor, yet thoughtful, touch I liked was on the main menu...there's a picture of Edward G. Robinson in character, brandishing a gun, with wisps of smoke coming out of the barrel.  It's barely noticeable, but it's there...

871119,2,6304429207,"Just as James Cagney broke through to stardom in 1931 as ""The Public Enemy"", so Edward G Robinson did the same in 1930 with ""Little Caesar"".  These are the 2 gangster films which really established the genre and typecast their leads for the rest of their careers. Both actors worked hard to break the typecasting and in Robinson's case, he was a very talented actor of great range and probably the greatest actor never to have received an Oscar for best actor. For those who don't know his work, I recommend ""Scarlet Street"" and ""Double Indemnity"" for starters.

Robinson dominates ""Little Caesar"" even more than Cagney did his vehicle but mainly because the rest of the film is so mediocre.  The plot, based on the life of Al Capone, concerns the rapid rise and fall of braggard Little Rico.  Robinson snarls out his lines and completely overwhelms the rest of the cast. The narrative is unconvincing and there is little justification or logic to Rico's progress except his arrogance.  No wonder crime seemed attractive.  This is probably due to hack director Mervyn Le Roy who brings none of the flair to the film which William A Wellman did to ""The Public Enemy"".  The photography is static, the dialogue stilted and most of the supporting actors poor.  This is very obviously an early talkie with all the limitations that implies. Douglas Fairbanks Jr plays Rico's friend and he is dismal. The ending is justly famous, the best moment in the film.

The DVD print is variable; at times crystal clear then suddenly grainy with a white vertical line down the screen. All the usual Warner's extras are included. The short documentary about the film is much easier to take than the nasal drawl of the commentator to be heard while viewing the film. Pity too because the commentator knows his stuff and, with reference to the original script, provides interesting insight into the censorship of the time. He also paces his commentary so that you can watch the film as he speaks and this is far superior to others who do not draw breath. Both the cartoon and the newsreel seem from a different age like the film and the dreary short features a very young Spencer Tracy. Leonard Maltin's introduction to the ""Warners Night at the Movies"", in fact, is the best feature of all. His introductions sum each feature up accurately and concisely - a good example that sometimes less is best. Maltin has a relaxed and warm style and comes over very well!

The DVD can be purchased alone or as part of the great value Warner's Gangster Collection. It is probably the dud of the set for while it is historically important, the antique filming techniques make it almost unwatchable today, except, of course, for Robinson.",1153699200,4,2706,4.750533049040512
871120,3,6304429207,"I watched this because I am studying classic film. I am not into gangster pictures, really. But since discovering James Cagney not long ago, I do find some of them enjoyable. James Cagney gangster films are interesting because he had such an exuberant personality...he is just such fun to watch! I found I didn't much care about Edward G. Robinson's character in Little Caesar; he wasn't a likeable person at all. In the end, you feel he gets what he justly deserves, whereas in The Roaring Twenties, you tend to feel sorry for Cagney's character not being a ""big shot"" anymore, which is very weird, for is it not odd to feel sorry for a gangster?

I thought this was filmed well for an early sound film...not static and ""stagey"" as many films in this time period are. Yes, at times one can see the acting is a bit overdone and dramatic; lines aren't always delivered as well as they could have been, but overall I thought this film was quite good. It took two watchings to get the full plot...I was very tired the first night and also some films aren't as clear as to what is going on. I did ""get it"" the second night. The things that stood out to me were other actors. The police detective Flaherty, well as soon as he spoke, I knew I had  heard his voice somewhere before. So I closed my eyes and listened, and yes, he was the frustrated, overworked newspaper editor in Nancy Drew, Reporter. Also, Ma Magdalena, I recongized her as one of the old hag peasants in A Tale of Two Cities, by looks, and also on hearing her voice I instantly thought, ""she is the voice of the wicked queen in Disney's Snow White"", and I was right. And Otero, I remember from 42nd Street. Glend Farrell as Olga I agree was miscast...she didn't seem the right sort of woman that I would believe a guy like Joe to fall in love with...a bit too hard on the edges, not quite feminine and pretty enough. It was fun to see Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in another film too (also saw him in Prisoner of Zenda).

I have read lots of comments about Little Caesar not being a normal man...well, I think people tend to read into some things way too much with that sort of thing and many other things in pre code films. I think Little Caesar was just a power hungry guy and didn't have time for ""dames"" in his life. He seemed to like jewelry a lot, and to be dressed up and have his hair combed just right, but that doesn't mean you are not a normal man. I think Otero was just ""one of the guys"" he could trust most, and was his close friend now that Joe had gone off dancing with Olga, and nothing more. I agree the scene of Little Caesar and Otero sitting on the bed and talking together was a bit different; can't say if I have seen it in a classic film before. But I don't read into it that it meant more than just them talking, and the bed was the handy place to be since there wasn't much other furniture in the room.

Overall, I would say the quality of the film was pretty good for its age. It was interesting to watch, but I have seen other gangster films I like better. The extras were interesting; that cartoon with the obvious Mickey Mouse copy ""cat"" was boring and dumb. The short with Spencer Tracy was a bit over dramatic, but fun to see him so young! My 8 yr. old son right away caught on what Spencer really did with the gun when he goes out! I really was understanding it all like his wife as she listened to the policemen outside her window! I didn't have a chance to listen to the full commentary, but the short documentary was interesting enough. This is worth a watch if you are studying classic film; but for enjoyment, I would recommend most any Cagney gangster film over this one.",1151107200,2,3665,4.276657060518732
871121,4,6304429207,"There were many excellent 1930s movies including a number made by Bette Davis, such as Dark Victory, but most of the movies of that era have faded into memory and are part of early film history, and most are neither viewed or sold. The present 1931 film is the exception. It is a short but important film in the gangster era that we still can buy or rent, and view.

There are a few problems with the filming and the directing, and the movie cannot be compred with more modern movies. There are few close ups and only three times in the movie do we see close shots of Edward G Robinson that show him ""acting"" - including the famous last scene; most shots are full body shots taken from a distance in an office ""stage style"" as we hear his snarling voice barking out orders - but sometimes looking a bit wooden. Still it is still an entertaining movie and worth a watch.

I have seen Edward G Robinson in a number of old movies including Bogart's 1948 Key Largo - where he dominated the film with his Rocco character (still alive with a slight name change?) - and also in Double Indemnity from 1944 with Fred McMurray, one of the best movies of the early 1940s, where he plays an insurance adjuster. I thought his acting was exceptional in both movies, so I had expected a bit more from the present movie. Edward G Robinson was in about 70 films, and lived to be 80, dying in 1973, but only half a dozen of his films are still remembered. This is one of them.

The present movie seems like an old movie in terms of fit and finish and the audio was poor. I guess it should be since it is a 1931 movie, one of the oldest available on the market. There was lots of small jerks and white spots flashing on the movie film. The actors tend to yell their lines or project similar to stage actors, something that is distracting and had disappeared by the end of the 1930s. Also, the film quality is not great and there are few close ups of Edward G Robinson.

The plot is good but short and the movie is just 79 minutes long, barely over an hour. Edward G Robinson dominates the movie as a ruthless gangster, and one assumes that he was similar to Al Capone, as he rises to power in what seeems like weeks. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is an acceptable Joe Massara, Rico's pal from the old days. The other supporting actors are fairly weak, and the film could have used a stronger cast. Sargeant Flaherty played by Thomas Jackson is the only supporting actor with a heartbeat.

This 1931 film is considered to be the movie that made Edward G Robinson a star, but I thought his Key Largo performance with Bogart and Bacall in 1948 was a lot better. That movie is a slick Warner's movie directed by John Huston, but still filmed in black and white. By that time both Bogart and Robinson were seasoned actors and the film technology had improved a lot. The actual craft fit and finish of Key Largo made 20 years later is excellent by comparison, and it captures Edward G's rivetting ""Rocco"" performance with many close up expressions and good lines. If you want to see a strong acting performance by Edward G, see that film. Also, do not miss Double Indemnity, that is also an exceptional movie with Robinson - thought by many critics and film makers themselves as one of the best ever. I bought these two other film noir movies here on line on DVD, but Double Indemnity was only available used.

Still, for its time Little Caesar remains a classic, and one of the few to survive as a commercial product 75 years later, where you can buy the DVD ""new"". I just rented and did not buy since I already had bought his other two surviving films on DVD that are better.

871123,4,6304429207,"There are some movies that defy criticism.  LITTLE CAESAR is a creaky old early talkie that suffers from static camera movements and competently undistinguished direction by Mervyn LeRoy.  LITTLE CAESAR is one of the most important movies in Hollywood history, boasting a memorable to immortal performance by Edgar G. Robinson as the title character, Cesare Enrico `Rico' Bandello, and one of the greatest endings in cinema (Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico!?)  Whaddya know, whaddya say about a movie like LITTLE CAESAR?

  I suppose you start by saying it's a great movie, but it sure feels old.  Action takes place around concealed microphones, musical underscoring is virtually nonexistent, and some of the melodramatic elements - like the scene with the doting Italian mother - seem to belong to the age of Victoria, paper collars, and gas footlights. On the other hand, Robinson's performance as the brutal and ambitious gangster is timeless and close to perfect.  There's a glowering, guttural, feral quality to it that pulls the movie up with him.  His best scene comes towards the end of the film. The fallen and unrecognized Rico, unslept eyes dark and watery, hip flash of hooch nearly drained, listens as a couple of other flophouse denizens read aloud a newspaper article about the great, missing Little Caesar.  Robinson grunts and mewls as the newspaper is read aloud, responding to what he hears.  With nothing but facial expressions, body language and grunts Robinson pulls back the skin covering Rico's psyche and presents it for public inspection.  It's a marvelous bit of business tucked into one of the greatest movie acting jobs ever.

  The transfer print isn't pristine, but acceptable - usually pretty good.  As is their custom with their Gangster releases, Warner Brothers packs the dvd with a bunch of extras.

  -  The 17 min. `End of Rico, Beginning of the Antihero' special offers a brief history of the gangster movie from the silent era to the present, discusses how Robinson got the breakthrough part, and the history of the cigar as a prop in gangster movies.

- Trailer for 1931's `Five Star Final,' a Edgar G. Robinson vehicle about sex, scandal, and tabloid newspapers.

-  The 6 min., one-reel short, `The Hard Guy', stars a very young Spencer Tracy as an out-of-work faddah wit' a sick kid in a depressed area of New York City.  Best line - ""Guy, you're getting hard-boiled again.""

- Cartoon `Lady, Play Your Mandolin.' Musical black-and-white Merrie Melodies offering.  A happy-dance musical with spaghetti limbed gorillas and horses.  Stars Warner Brothers' Mickey-Mouse-on-rat-pills star, Foxy.

871124,3,6304429207,"""Little Caesar"" (1931) is a slightly off kilter recanting of the Al Capone story, told under the auspices of not so pure fiction. Chicago nobody, Caesar Enrico Bandello (Edward G. Robinson) acquires a toe hold in Sam Vettori's (Stanley Fields) mob. In no time he's muscled Sam out of his digs and bumped up against rival thug, Little Arnie Lorch (Maurice Black). After some fast talking and slick shooting, Caesar emerges the kingpin of kingpins; a magnet for hard-hitting smart talking success or, if you prefer, the antithesis of the American dream. Shrewd and ever growing suspicious and paranoid, Caesar eventually finds both his niche and his downfall in Olga Strassoff (Glenda Farrell), a little bit of something who weaves her magic like a spider. Along with ""The Public Enemy"", this film established the Warner in-house style for social consciousness and nail-biting drama.
Director, Raoul Walsh seems to know his way around a gat in this yarn about gangsters and vixens, but in retrospect, this film lacks the immediate fireball response generated by ""The Public Enemy.""
Warner's DVD transfer falls short of expectations. Though the gray scale is often nicely balanced, the image quite often reflects a decidedly soft characteristic that is blurry on the eyes. Age related artifacts are persistent and sometimes distracting. At times the image quality is quite unstable, changing from generally smooth and nicely contrasted to wildly grainy image quality from shot to shot. Vertical lines and a tears crop up throughout the film and, while not present for very long, nevertheless distract. The audio is mono and generally pleasing, though background hiss is quite noticeable. Extras include a commentary by Richard Jewell that is just average, a newly produced featurette and Leonard Maltin doing his thing with ""Warner's Night at the Movies.""

871125,4,6304429207,"One thing a modern audience has to overcome in viewing ""Little Caesar"" is the staginess of this early talking picture.  The medium was in it's infancy and screen acting had not really been refined so one has to overlook the limitations.  The story here is rather predictable, the script telegraphs the rise and fall of Rico Bandello.  What isn't ordinary is the performance of Edward G. Robinson in the title role.  He just dominates the landscape of this film.  He demonstrates the ruthlessness, the insecurity, and vanity all contained in Rico.  What is also important about Robinson's performance is that you can see to a degree how his portrayal informed future gangster depictions, that ""Little Caesar"" is a reference point for future crime pics.  I'd also like to commend Warner Brothers for lovingly packaging the films in their library.  Aside from a documentary, the film contains a newsreel, a cartoon that looks suspiciously like a Mickey Mouse knock-off, and an interesting Depression -era short subject starring Spencer Tracy about a man who is frustrated about his inability to provide for his family.",1108771200,2,1115,5.087912087912088
