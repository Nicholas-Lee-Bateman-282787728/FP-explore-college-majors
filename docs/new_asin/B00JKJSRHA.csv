6371612,1,B00JKJSRHA,Very disappointing. Not what you would expect from Ester Williams.,1411776000,,66,5.7
6371613,5,B00JKJSRHA,"This is essentially the same as Warner's larger ""Esther Williams TCM Spotlight Volume 1"" boxset, but minus 1 film (""Easy to Wed"").  If you are a fan of Ms Williams or looking to get your feet wet for the very first time - pardon the pun - you'll enjoy these 4 delights which capture Williams at several crucial points in her film career.

Following several small roles, Williams made her starring debut in 1944's ""Bathing Beauty"", which set the template for most of her films at MGM.  Williams co-stars with comedian Red Skelton.  The 2 stars reunited for ""Neptune's Daughter"" in 1949, which introduced the classic Academy Award-nominated song ""Baby It's Cold Outside"".

In ""On An Island With You"" (1948), Williams co-stars with Peter Lawford and Cyd Charisse.  1953's ""Dangerous When Wet"" is arguably the best title in this collection, with Williams absolutely riding high, and includes Williams' legendary swimming sequence with Tom & Jerry.  Fernando Lamas, later Williams' real-life husband, and Barbara Whiting co-star.

Extras on these TCM sets are routinely recycled from previous discs, so there's nothing new to entice those who already own these films in the first ""TCM Spotlight"" volume.  The ""Bathing Beauty"" disc includes Ms Williams' TCM 'Private Screenings' episode, which is quite illuminating.  We are very lucky that most (if not all) of Williams' work is now on DVD for a whole new generation to enjoy.  These 4 films provide a perfect introduction.",1406246400,21,1468,5.100418410041841
6371614,5,B00JKJSRHA,"Esther Williams movies are expensive to buy separately, and some titles can't even be found.  This four movie set from TCM is a real bargain.  The quality of the movies is excellent.  Esther Williams movies are visually beautiful, and such a joy to watch.",1471651200,,255,4.75
6371615,3,B00JKJSRHA,Thanks a bunch. My Moms grew up watching Esther Williams in swimming competitions.. I will be sending her this vd for her viewing pleasure in the coming weeks. I know that she will love it. Thanks..,1471305600,,198,4.527777777777778
6371616,5,B00JKJSRHA,Wanted DVD for grand child,1464566400,,26,4.4
6371617,5,B00JKJSRHA,"Very enjoyable bit of cotton candy viewing. Focus is on music and, of course, Esther's incredible diving.",1462147200,,105,5.235294117647059
6371618,4,B00JKJSRHA,Bathing beauty is still very good with excellent parody of Red Skelton. Interesting story and excellent music. In the other three films is the story farfetched. The waterballets are beauriful.,1456963200,,192,5.433333333333334

6371620,5,B00JKJSRHA,"Lovely quality. I loved all of the films, but especially the comedies: Neptune's Daughter, On the Island With You and Bathing Beauty. Great price for the set!",1449014400,,158,4.888888888888889
6371621,5,B00JKJSRHA,"This collection of Esther Williams movies is wonderful.  I enjoy watching them because they're wholesome, and something the entire family can watch together.  In addition to Ms. Williams, there are many excellent actors and actresses in supporting roles, and the swimming scenes are beautiful and relaxing to watch.",1446422400,,315,5.541666666666667
6371622,4,B00JKJSRHA,I really enjoy Esther and her attitude.  Great movies,1445299200,,53,4.888888888888889
6371623,5,B00JKJSRHA,"Great set! I'm a huge Esther Williams fan, and On An Island With You is one of my favorite films of all time. It was really great to finally own it (it isn't available anywhere online), so that alone was worth the money for me. The other three were a first-time watch for me because I was still getting into her filmography, but they are all good films. The special features of each disc were very nice too, though a couple of the cartoons came across as a little creepy (but I guess that was just the time period). If you want a good collection without the cost of the larger Esther Williams volumes, this is a great buy.",1442707200,,622,4.235294117647059

8651770,4,B00JKJSRHA,"The movies are classic! But the actual product has me a little unsure. The dvds are labeled like disc 1, disc 3, disc 4, and disc 5. I just don't understand a reason for them to be labeled like that. Did they take these discs from a different set that came with more dvds and just put them into this boxed set or......? Anyway, I guess I should say that the one disc I have watched so far did work perfectly--I guess it's just the disc labeling that has me confused",1489536000,,465,4.1208791208791204

8651776,5,B00JKJSRHA,"The discs came with numbers on them, so I'm guessing they come from another TCM dvd collection. However, I wouldn't really let that bother anyone else interested in these movies.",1475193600,,178,4.966666666666667
8651777,3,B00JKJSRHA,"I liked Bathing Beauty and was mad I had to get 4 of them when I only wanted that one.  I liked Red Skelton's funny routines and Harry James was great always loved him.  But I got another 5 disc Esther Williams set and it's so boring because If you've seen one of those corny, romantic musicals of hers you have seen them all and I got really bored so I put the second set up in my closet.",1474761600,,389,3.911392405063291
