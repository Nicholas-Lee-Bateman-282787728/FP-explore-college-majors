3773436,5,B001R60ESE,"Keep in mind I am already a fan of Chris after seeing ""Chris Botti Live"" for the first time and love his music. The video / audio quality of the Boston concert on Blu-ray is significantly better! No compression artifacts and the video almost looks 3D! Enjoyed everyone that performed... BTW, I didn't find the brief discussion between some of the acts distracting at all. If you are a fan of Chris, you will really enjoy this concert!",1239408000,4,434,4.576923076923077
3773437,5,B001R60ESE,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. Chris Botti does an outstanding job. My absolute favorites are Emmanual featuring Lucia Micarelli and Cinema Paradiso with Yo-Yo Ma. All the performances were really good but these two where simply heavenly.,1238803200,7,250,5.275
3773438,5,B001R60ESE,"I'm not certain that Chris Botti could release anything that I wouldn't rate a 5 so understand my bias. I have most of his audio CDs and I would rate this DVD near the top. Botti, in his own icy-cool signature, soulful and soothing sound - draws from jazz, pop and classical musical in his line-up. This CD was recorded at an event which took place on September 18th 2008 at Boston's famous Symphony Hall where Botti is joined by the Boston Pops Orchestra. In addition to new and seemingly even more compelling spins on his classic instrumental trumpet solos (""When I fall in Love""; ""Time to Say Goodbye""; ""Ave Maria""), Botti invites a unique cast of artists to join him on stage including Sting, Josh Groban, Steven Tyler (Aerosmith), Yo-Yo Ma, John Mayer and Katherine McPhee (American Idol) - with my favorites being ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" with Botti/McPhee and ""If I Ever Lose My Faith in You"" with Botti/Sting and John Mayer's rendition of Sinatra's ""Glad to Be Unhappy."" Botti is at the top of his game in this performance - crisp, warm and soothing - and the man can hit and stick the high notes. Sit back, relax and be prepared to be entertained - - Botti has the magical ability to take you away to a happy place.",1238544000,14,1228,4.486607142857143
3773439,2,B001R60ESE,"I also watched this concert on PBS, and agree with other reviewers that the performances and production values are first rate. The problem is the incessant talking between performances. It breaks the continuity and ruins the show for me. The chatter should be at the end of the disc in the ""special features"" section. Just my opinion...",1237161600,17,336,4.912280701754386
3773440,5,B001R60ESE,"I caught this show on PBS-WTTW in Chicago and it is spectacular! I fell in love during this show!  Chris Botti is a dream on the trumpet and the show from start to finish was fantastic!  He brings together such an array for talent that I was hooked from the first minute.  Even if you are not a ""jazz"" fan, this music is so mellow, so contemporary, so eclectic, so luscious that you can't help but enjoy it as I did.  I want to hear (see) it again, and again!!!",1237161600,27,461,4.088888888888889
3773441,5,B001R60ESE,"I saw this on PBS a few nights ago and it blew my mind!  To be honest, I have never heard of him before, and the thought of watching a trumpet concert would not usually spark my interest--but this was AMAZING!!!  The variety of vocal guests added such an incredibly dynamic to his performance.  I loved all of it, but especially ""I got you under my skin."" My twelve year old son is starting junior high this coming fall, and met the band director at his new school last night.  He is trying to decide between the tuba, trombone, and trumpet!  I can't wait for him to see this!",1236902400,9,576,4.247706422018348
3773442,5,B001R60ESE,"I was there for both nights of the taping in Boston. This concert was phenomenal. The performance with Steven Tyler is worth the price of admission alone. Chris Botti has a knack for getting ""A"" list guests and getting something totally new from each of their performances. A stunning recording of a spectacular night.",1236038400,29,318,4.907407407407407
3773443,5,B001R60ESE,"I saw this last night on PBS....RUN, do NOT walk to order this one. Simply majestic and spectacular music from all corners.",1236038400,17,123,4.636363636363637
3773444,5,B001R60ESE,Chris Botti's arrangements and performance are smooth.  The array of guests who join him provide a breadth of style and genre that make this a concert that bears up well under multiple viewings.,1484524800,,194,4.878787878787879

3773447,5,B001R60ESE,Awesome Blu-ray!,1481241600,,16,7.5
3773448,3,B001R60ESE,"Picture and sound quality is great, not to mention the performance.

A big letdown is video and audio are way out of sync!! I had to delay audio on my receiver to max at 100ms for it to be enjoyable to watch. This out-of-sync problem never happens to all other program sources, at least not so bad that I have to adjust audio delay on my receiver, so I know for a fact it's the Blu-ray disk that's the culprit.",1480723200,,410,4.125
3773449,5,B001R60ESE,This is in my top three favorite Blu-Ray concerts.  I run a 7.1 setup through a Marantz receiver.  Dolby TrueHD really shines as the audio is some of the best I've ever owned.  There are dozens of high definition camera angles that are shot very artistically.  You will not regret this purchase.  From Sting to Steven Tyler this Blu-ray has something for everyone.  This is one of the few Blu-ray concerts that I own that play perfect right from the start.  I don't have to adjust the bass levels or the individual speaker levels for the best mix.  It is that well put together.  I recommend Sting Live in Berlin as another top notch production.,1473120000,2,645,4.539130434782609

3773451,5,B001R60ESE,"We saw Chirs Botti in Nashville in April 2016, and we were awestruck by his performance, and want to see more of him, so we bought this and we love it.  Hoping to see him in person again sometime, somewhere next year.  He great to watch and hear live, but it's not all about him - he surrounds himself and shares the spotlight with diverse, entertaining musicians.",1473033600,,364,4.417910447761194

3773457,5,B001R60ESE,"This is an amazing concert!  My wife and I purchased this Blu-ray for ourselves several years ago and have enjoyed it time and time again.  The audio is spectacular and the video is perfect...it feels like you are in the concert hall yourself.  We had the privilege of seeing Chris Botti and a smaller jazz band in Jacksonville, Florida in February of 2016, and the music and his personality are as genuine on this Blu-ray as they are live.  We enjoyed the live concert so much that we decided to purchase this Blu-ray again, and give it to our friend for her upcoming birthday.  They enjoy live music as much as we do, and we know they are going to love this introduction to Chris Botti and his many talents.",1462752000,,709,4.423076923076923

3773468,5,B001R60ESE,"This is one of my favorite concerts on dvd/bluray. It's one of the few concerts where there's a good chance that you will like every number even being diverse as they are. I'm talking Stephen Tyler and Yo Yo Ma and everything in between. All and i mean all the guest performances were excellent. My favorites were Lucia Micarelli who played violin with such passion, Yo Yo Ma who is always superb, and Katherine McPhee who I've never seen looking better. The audio is superb and the video on bluray is clear. This is a reference quality disc you would use to show off your system.",1435363200,,580,4.481132075471698
3773469,5,B001R60ESE,"Oh. I recently sprung for a 105d, having been convinced by the reviews that the sound stage was every bit as good as the vid. Finally started getting a few blu-ray concerts. Based again on the reviews Botti's blu-ray Boston concert was rather well done. Put it on when I got it & honestly treated it as background for a few tracks, thought ""okay, not bad"" and put it up. I'm a bit of a trumpet nut having wished I could have blown mine even close to good. Tonight several months later I'm paying total attention and must admit I'm awed. Chris has done a stunning piece and was gracious to bring an incredible range of stunning artists to the party, playing a wonderful range of genres to the stage. AND, the recording, as the vid, is superb.",1435104000,,741,4.3768115942028984
3773470,5,B001R60ESE,"I own over 50 concert dvds from jazz to rock.  This is an outstanding product - one of my most watched concerts that I return to time and time again.  There is a wide variety of music.  The level of musicianship is phenomenal.  Excellent camera work, video editing, and lighting.  A great selection of guests.  The only blemish is the appearance of Stephen Tyler, who unlike the class and professionalism of every other person, hogs the stage and marches around as if he is the star of the show, despite the fact that he is the least talented person on the stage.",1434412800,,563,4.470588235294118

3773488,5,B001R60ESE,No artist enjoys presenting his fellow performers and listening to them more than Chris Botti. This show with the Boston Pops builds to varying levels of excitement to which the crowd and in turn the viewer get carried along. This is a phenomenal concert.,1411344000,,255,4.818181818181818
3773489,5,B001R60ESE,Wonderful Boston concert and capture on BluRay disc. The BluRay expense is worth it for the better sound and some behind the scenes footage. You are in for a treat if you have yet to hear this concert. The nuances that Chris squeezes out of that old horn are just amazing. Chris started in Sting's band before becoming his opening act. Out on his own for the past 10 years he performs as many as 300 concerts a year. Hard to believe that he is 52 already.,1408752000,,455,4.241379310344827

guests, and above all, Chris Botti; think Herp Albert; All Hirt; Chet Baker,
J.J. Johnson all together; but you may close the door to Winton Marsallys,
cause eventually he doesn't know what he is playing.",1387756800,,278,5.2

3773513,5,B001R60ESE,"This is one ""kick Ass"" concert, its the one DVD I put on when I want to show-off my system or just remind myself.  I can't tell you how many times I've listened and watch this DVD - it just gets better every time.  The production of this was masterfully done.  The sound quality shakes the walls, and the clarity is glass shattering.  I thought that an earlier DVD was good, but this one is exceptional.  The concert was a top performance of Botti at his best - the first piercing sounds at the opening of the concert to the shouts and screams at the end of the concert.  Of course, the lineup was superb with my favorites being ""Sting"" and John Mayer, but everyone else was also awesome, giving the best performance each time.  Of the musical performers - well you know the Drummer is off the chart as usual, but the Bass player is also unbelieveable especially on the Miles Davis tune - I really liked the way the producers made the performance a black/white background indicative of  a memory, but their current interpretation of this hip miles tune is timeless (Kinda blue).  The beautiful lady on the violin played her song so beautiful, it brings tears to my eyes as she just pours all of her heart and soul into this selection.  I could go on and on, but It would do it justice - just get this DVD, and it promises to be one of your best concerts in your collection.",1386720000,,1373,4.349019607843137

3773521,5,B001R60ESE,"This is one of the best Blu-ray concerts in my collection. The song selection, guest singers, music and sound quality are simply outstanding. It is tough to pick a best performance, but the duet with Chris and Lucia stole my heart. The duet with Chris and Yo-Yo Ma make the Blu-ray worth buying if only to capture this special moment of these two modern day marvels in your personal library.

The array of musical genres he played highlighted his versatility and it was wonderful to see the mix of musical stars, young and old, those famous in their own right and those up-and coming, who performed with him.

The musical quartet who played with him were outstanding.  Billy Childs playing on the piano and Billy Kilson on drums were superlative demonstrating both mastery and passion. Dominic Miller on Guitar and Robert Hurst on bass were also superlative.  A wonderful addition to my musical DVD collection.",1370736000,2,613,5.09

I bought this DVD because I  was so impressed that anyone could get such beautiful sensitive sounds out of a trumpet as Botti.  He plays  ""Ave Maria"" like it was written for the trumpet!  The variety of talent from his guests was amazing. (Who would expect to see Yo Yo Ma and Steven Tyler in the same performance?)  The blending of the voices in the duet of Sting and Josh Groban, the vitality and scatting of Sy Smith, Billy Kilson's drumming together with all his regular musicians made a truly unforgettable show!",1369785600,2,683,4.595041322314049

Starting with his touring band, Billy Childs, Billy Kilson and Mark Whitfield are second to none.

Add the Boston Pops and such iconic voices as Sting, Josh Groban, and even Steven Tyler...really?...but it works! There are wonderfully written arrangements allowing Chris to artistically play off his guest instrumentalists such as Yo Yo Ma and Lucia Micarelli.  The sound engineers did a masterful job mixing and recording the event.

In my opinion Steven Tyler alone made this concert worth purchasing. Katharine McPhee's brilliant ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" performance spiced up the concert a whole lot. (Sultry and flirty!)

Yo-Yo Ma's performance of Cinema Paradiso was amazing, the combination of cello and trumpet was beautiful.

Highly recommended!

3773554,5,B001R60ESE,"Using only one word this BRDVD is ""Magnificent""

There are but a handful of living artist that if ever you get a chance to see you should at any cost and this is one.  Several of the others are on this very same disc.

There are just a few moments in life where something happens that is larger than life itself. It is even rarer when you can see or hear these things happen.  Sometime we get lucky and put them in a format that we can enjoy forever.  This is one of those times and this is one of those recordings.  This recording is proof of a higher power and that something else other than man exists.

Now that you have the blue ray disc player and several hundred dollars' worth of speakers, this is the performance your system has been waiting for. I'm not saying you should listen to this, but that you need to listen to this.  Even if you don't have an overpriced system I have no doubt that the passion of these artist will infuse your heart, body, and soul.

Get this BRDVD, and then get the CD for the car, and when he comes to town get TICKETS!",1323561600,3,1057,4.142156862745098
3773555,5,B001R60ESE,"Consider this:  Tickets to this performance were probably not inexpensive: $100-200 would be my guess.

This Blu Ray disk gives you the best possible seat in the house and the DolbyHD sound is so amazing and mixed so well you really feel like you are there. With that in mind the cost of admission for this best seat in the house for me and a group of my friends is a grand total of less than $25, and I can watch it again and again.

To say this Blu Ray is the deal of the century is an understatement.  The video is amazing.  The sound is superbly done.  The performance of Botti and all his guest are amazing.  Someone complained that all the talk between songs destroyed the flow of the film.  But I found Botti to be an articulate speaker who gave vital information to preface each song and add meaning to what was coming next.  Each little speech was short and to the point.

While it would have been nice to be there live and experience this show with others as it happened, I am so thankful for the state of technology where watching this show on a TV can be as amazing as it is. I cannot recommend this Blu Ray enough. Ten Stars Please!",1323388800,,1145,4.2110091743119265

And Chris Botti brings energy and passion to his music that is impossible to adequately describe. In addition, Botti surrounds himself with impeccable performances by other artists, understanding that genius not only loves company, but demands it. This Blu-Ray concert pulls you in - from casual observer to fully invested participator. You cannot simply watch this video without becoming involved emotionally, artistically and intellectually. Be forewarned that this concert will spoil you. No longer will you be satisfied by the kind of walmart performances that were good enough before you knew better. Chris Botti in Boston will take you to another level; a higher plain of music appreciation.",1323043200,2,862,5.488721804511278

As for the diverse lineup of artists, I think that pretty much depends on how eclectic your tastes are. I personally didn't have any problems with Steve Tyler and Yo Yo Ma being on the same stage. But that's just me. You would have to listen for yourself.

I had 2 issues - one of which led me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars. The performance of the Ennio Morricone piece from Cinema Paradiso is both captivating and intense. Yet in the middle of one of his solo, inexplicably Chris winks at someone in the audience. This just ruined the whole piece for me. (juxtapose this with the comment he made at the end regarding needing a drink...) This is one of my favorite all time piece but because of this, I will only listen to this piece on CD. This is a case where listening is truly better than seeing.

The other issue was with the disc itself. The initial disc I received was defective in that the ""special feature"" wouldn't play back properly. Amazon promptly shipped a replacement which worked fine; typical kind of A+ service from Amazon",1297468800,2,1126,4.382775119617225

a) Accompanied by the Boston Pops Orchestra; b) Fantastic HD video of concert and c) in awesome surround sound.
Of course, this all would not have been possible if it wasn't for the Audio/Video System that I was viewing/listening to, at the time. [I noted the name of the BD Title/Artist, looked it up on Amazon and ordered it]

For me Katharine McPhee's rendition of ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" and Steven Tyler's ""Cryin'"" were worth the price of the DVD alone.  Everything else is a bonus.

Some of the usual suspects (Yoyo Ma, Sting, Josh Groban, Steven Tyler) once again perform well at this concert. You'll love Tyler singing ""Crying"". This is where rock and roll suddenly breaks out at a jazz concert.

The song choices and the show overall just seems to work better to me. Beautifully filmed and edited, the only thing I don't like is one aspect of the sound. The audience clapping in time is channeled through to the surround speakers as expected, but it is a terrible cheap and tinny sound.... almost like a synthetic clapping sound with the treble turned up high. And it's too loud which tends to hurt the overall mix at times. Actually the soundscape is a bit too conservative / safe / thin / lacking dynamics for my taste..... but perhaps that style of mix better suits such a large stage full of musicians. However on balance, this is an absolutely excellent show with some very odd surprises (Steve Tyler??) that somehow just work really well. Great stuff indeed.",1283040000,4,888,4.698717948717949

I've seen him in concert twice (once in Vegas and once in Albuquerque, NM), and both times, he came out after his concert and signed autographs and spoke to people on a level that is unheard of in today's society.  He didn't just sign the autograph and hand it back to you and say ""next"".  He took the time to speak to me, ask me a couple of questions, and we talked a little about his relationship with Sting (of which I am a huge fan).  He posed for a couple of pictures with me and is just a genuinely nice guy.  He does this after every concert, and I can't say enough about what that means, considering the big egos that are out there in the market today.  This guy has it all.

I have played this disk many, many times and each time is a treat. 'I've Got You Under My Skin' featuring Katharine McPhee made me fall in love. There are cuts that bliss me out, especially 'Cinema Paradiso' featuring Yo-Yo Ma. A spectacularly beautiful piece. Tears of joy run down my cheeks.

Many a day I've come home thrown this in the Ps3, poured myself a glass of red wine and relaxed. This concert will have that effect on you, Botti's music has the ability to transform your day from stressful misgivings and burdens to blissful peace. The concert itself looks great but the sound is where it's will amaze. I also recommend Chris's other blu-ray but I think this one is slightly better. Like his previous BR Sting shines and Botti's friends and musical associates all add their own unique touch. There's a few songs that don't quite work on this BR, Josh Grobin's duet with Sting seemed a bit forced, I think Grobin over sings quite a bit on this BR actually(I guess that's his style) and Steven Tyler signing cryin' was utterly ridiculously and completely out of character for this concert.

3773585,5,B001R60ESE,"I've heard some of his music some time ago but was not a really a big fan untill I got this Blu-ray disc. The Quality of his music along with it being Blu-ray, and the audio quality really won me over. This is a really fun concert to watch as the song selection never gets boring. He brings out some realy top notch guests to play and have sing along with band. I mean really top notch, Yo Yo Ma's performance (as usual) was really heart felt, and when Steven Tyler sang to his father, that was special. This whole concert is filled with special songs and feelings. The quality of the video, video mix, audio, audio mix is also special and with feeling. Just an all around over the top performance and it's on Blu-ray!!!! Keep'um commin!!!!

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Bands that wish to have there performances recorded and recognised should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1265673600,,1374,4.550607287449393
3773586,5,B001R60ESE,"I purchased this Blu-ray from Amazon before the holidays and will confirm that it is of the highest quality. Perhaps the best review I can give is that my wife and I have watched it at least 6 times together and it has such good parts that we've shared it with friends when they are over for the evening. A lot of my friends are musicians, so the evening turns into ""You have to see the drum solo on the last song,"" or ""There's a part where Josh Groban messes up Sting's lyrics during a duet with Sting in the bonus features!""

* Performance
- My faves are Josh Groban, Sting, Steven Tyler, and in general, Chris Botti, his band, and the Boston Pops.  Wow.  So good.

* Video quality
- Not only does it sound amazing, but as a musician, I really appreciate the long, detailed camera shots of Chris Botti's 4-piece band.  Drums, bass, guitar, and piano.  These players are not only technically fantastic, but they are so expressive when they perform.  It takes the show to a whole new level, and I much prefer it compared to David Foster's Blu-ray where the band is mostly darkened near the back of the stage.  Looks great on my 54"" Panasonic G-10 Plasma. I'm using a PS3 to play the Blu-ray.

* Audio
- I currently only have 2.1 audio, but the mix sounds good to my ears.  It certainly is quality enough to be made a live, audio-only CD album.",1264982400,7,1343,4.314741035856573

I'm surprised you don't sell a DVD that plays on a regular DVD player, or at least explain that Blu-Ray doesn't work on a regular DVD player.",1261526400,,311,4.43859649122807
3773601,4,B001R60ESE,"Wow! I saw part of this Blu-Ray in a Best Buy here in MN and was immediately impressed. I wanted to buy it then and there but, alas, they were out of it as were all of the other Best Buy stores in the Twin Cities. (Why have it on as a demo in your store when you don't have any to sell?) So I ordered this from Amazon and am still totally impressed.

Technically, the Dolby TrueHD 7.1/5.1 sound track is enveloping, crisp, and impeccably mixed. (I only have 5.1 so cannot comment on the 7.1 mix.) The smooth sound of Chris' trumpet is perfectly captured not being harsh nor dark. Chris has amazing tone and it's beautifully represented on this disk. The picture is stunning without presenting annoying hues that many live concert videos do. Thank the lighting crew for that. The blacks are dark yet detailed, and the colors vibrant. Detail overall is excellent.

Performances? You will see some musicians in circumstances that you have never seen them before. Yo Yo Ma jamming with Chris on the beautiful ""Cinema Paradiso"", and Steven Tyler (Yes, that one!) singing ""Smile"" (Yes, that one!) to his father in the front row. Both are simply astonishing performances. And violinist Lucia Micarelli with blow you away with her passionate, and emotional playing.

To tell you the truth, I had not even heard of Chris Botti before I saw this disk. I am not just a fan raving about this Blu-Ray, but a person that was totally captured initially and continue to love this performance. It does lag a bit in the 2nd quarter of the show, but picks up again with some spectacular songs with great guest artists. (John Mayer, Kathrine McPhee anyone?)

Chris plays a humble yet very competent host and I think that even if you are not a fan of this type of music, you'll be hard pressed to stop watching this disk.",1259280000,10,1800,4.546296296296297

I had heard a few of his songs on the radio and also saw him on a Bocelli dvd and this dvd confirms my prior impressions...Cris Botti is the real deal!!! The Concert was a delight to watch/listen and his guests just added to the enjoyment. A few weeks ago I had family and friends over and decided to play the dvd and needless to say, it was a huge hit. What surprised me was that even the younger kids sat thru most of it and said they liked it also. Needless to say, I watch it often and highly recommend it!",1258502400,,602,4.067226890756302

3773605,5,B001R60ESE,"My wife purchased this for me as a gift after reading rave reviews about the sound quality (96 kHz/24 bit) of this Blu-Ray on an audio forum we belong to. The moment she gave me the disc and I was very excited to tear into it! I honestly couldn't wait to see what it could do to rock my system (B&W speakers connected to McIntosh components) and it was playing within 2.5 minutes of being opened. I guess I'm still a kid at heart.
From the moment it started playing I was in awe. This is like listening to a high quality LP combined with superb HD video. Chris Botti has proven that he can easily stay away from the ""smooth jazz"" stereotype and on this recording he delivered something for everyone to enjoy from rock to Bach. To emphasize that point, my wife generally does not enjoy jazz and will usually leave the room when I am listening to that genre. In this case, she sat down with me and watched the entire video with me, commenting how great many of the performers were. She had favorites like Sting and Steven Tyler but she actually enjoyed other like Yo-Yo Ma and Lucia Micarelli. She got a few tears from Steven Tyler's dedication of Smile to his father and was very moved. My father who is now 90 years old and has a great love of music watched the disc on a recent visit to our home and said Ave Maria was one of the best renditions of that song he had heard. I would bet anyone among your family and friends that is between 16 and 100 years old will truly enjoy this recording.
In closing my review I would like to point out that our family  now usually rent instead of owning DVDs and Blu-Rays due to the uncertain future of where technology will take us and the fear of a load of obsolete media but this is one of those that you can play over and over. It is worth owning and worth every penny.  After the initial viewing it makes for great background music when working around the house and is nice to put on when guests are visiting.

On a footnote I STRONGLY encourage you to watch some of the bonus material! There is a man who had a medical emergency in the audience during the performance and you will hear about it and how the Chris Botti and Sting got the audience back on track, it is delightful.",1256688000,3,2222,4.235849056603773

What did not impress me was the audio on the blu ray.  My Denon did not pick up and type of DTS sound or surround sound so what I listened to in my home theatre room was stereo.  If I'm dishing out bucks for blu ray, I expect some type of better digi sound than stereo.  I want all of my speakers to roar.

I couldn't have been more satisfied, the guests he brings on stage are incredible, begining with Sting. To me, the interpretation by Yo Yo Ma is the highlight of the DVD, and worth by itself, the price of this musical.

My only disappointment was in the video.  The low lighting and soft focus maybe goes with the jazz - blues experience, but for a blu-ray DVD I still expected  high-definition video.  I project my DVDs on a 12 foot screen so video clarity or lack of it is noticeable.  Seems like a standard DVD format would do as well for this concert.",1245196800,,605,4.6415094339622645
3773661,5,B001R60ESE,"I just saw Chris at the Fillmore (formerly Jackie Gleason) on Miami Beach in the end of April. It was an amazing concert and we were fortunate to be there when Tito Puent was in the audience. Tito was invited on stage and played a several minute jam with the drummer. The whole night was really cool, the sound was excellent and the show was great from start to the finish when Chris played an unamplified solo of ""One More for the Road"" in the audience.

This Blu-ray concert is right there. I was taken back to the night at the Fillmore, but this time with much better seats, more guest performers and all in the beautiful Boston Symphony Hall. The sound is spectacular and the Blu-ray footage is like being there.

Get this disc, you will love it!",1244678400,,750,4.388489208633094
3773662,4,B001R60ESE,"What if you took stars from several generations (John Mayer to Steven Tyler) and musical genre (YoYo Ma to Sting)and had them perform mostly standards with an established jazz quintet (Botti and his very talented band of Billy Childs, Robert Hurst, Billy Kilson and guitarist Mark Whitfield) and the Boston Pops Orchestra. Here, you get demo quality video and audio recorded in a beautiful venue before a well-healed, courteous and appreciative audience.

I have never seen so much talent do so little to excite and inspire. For those of you old enough to remember, this is an Ed-Sullivan-Show-like revue without the comedian and the circus act. Nothing wrong here, especially if you know what your getting. But this musical landscape is painted by Turner not Van Gogh.

The disc is at its best with Botti and his band playing. They are outstanding individually and collectively. And there are several guest combos that work well including Botti with Yo Yo Ma, Botti and Whitfield with Katharine McPhee and, most especially, Botti with violinist Lucia Micarelli. Micarelli's performance--and costume--infuse much needed passion to some, otherwise, staid performances. And interestingly, it is Tyler's rendition of the Aerosmith anthem Cryin' that (finally) brings the crowd off their seats.

I recommend that you try to rent or borrow this disc before you buy. Decide for yourself whether it is one that you will want for repeated playback. ****",1244592000,4,1445,5.1931330472103

Botti is a charming MC and a wonderful soloist on trumpet.
My only slight caveat would be the two Sinatra songs sung by Mayer and McPhee. The material was not theirs stylistically and the interpretions were just OK.
Sting was the highlight as both song writer and singer.
