120111,5,0790736527,One of the best movies out there that tells you about life and the world. The story gets more true with each passing year. The actors are of the best quality and pull you in to believe and truly think about how the movie applies to the world we live in.

The film did a good job demonstrating what evil is,the problem is that it did too good of a job, that some of it became distasteful for some average viewers. I think I would have given it 4 stars without all of the sexual content.",1492387200,4,414,4.175

120138,5,0790736527,"This was actually a good movie. When the movie came out it was beyond it's time. This movie is kind of scary but it will wake you up and make you never want to tell a lie again. The movie starts out a little slow. Not that slow that you cannot get into it but it does take about ten minutes for it to warm up. But this movie is one of those movies that you keep in your collection. If you don't want to keep it in your collection, it's one of those movies that when you just hear the name you remember what the movie is about. Every time I come across the movie cover I always have to say out loud to myself that was a good movie. Good movies withstand the test of time. You can look at this movie 5 years later and it will still be a good movie. You can watch this movie over and over. You will not be disappointed.",1487894400,,816,3.863095238095238

Him and his wife get treated like the Second Coming and then proceed to act like a couple of overwhelmed hayseeds that came from an Iowa farm and not a big city (Jacksonville) law firm. Giddy public affection between Reeves and his wife is so out of place in the heady atmosphere of the great law firm in the biggest city that it beggared believability, at least in my opinion. In a word: overacted.",1482710400,,493,4.428571428571429

Charlize Theron manages to be convincing, and Keanu Reeves sustains the odd demand of being both obnoxious and clueless, but the verbose and banal screenplay pretty near overwhelms them. Pacino is John Milton, who, as some may know, was the author of ""Paradise Lost""--and here plays someone diabolical, or at least that would seem to be the pointless point. Add some ""diabolical"" special effects and you have a thoroughly annoying mess. RIP.",1477180800,,562,4.926315789473684

120509,2,0790736527,I had high expectations of this movie due to the number of 5 star reviews. I wanted to like it more than I actually did. It was slow and plodding. Pacino overacts as usual and I found his ridiculous laugh redundant at best and annoying at worst. Reeves was just ok as Is typical for him. The movie just barely edged out of the bad and into the mediocre category. The idea of good vs evil and a persons free will to choose is an interesting concept that wasn't delivered here. Characters were not developed so you didn't much care what happened to any of them. Way too much nudity and gratuitous sex that didn't add anything to the plot. This movie is not one i would recommend. It's a time waster.,1475625600,,697,4.287878787878788

The psychedelic visual effects with the wall at first worked well to set the dark, evil tone, but they went too far with it by morphing the swirls into humans. The movie was longer than it needed to be, so when they tried a couple lame plot twists near the end I was out of patience and just wanted it to finish.",1474848000,2,484,4.159574468085107

120564,4,0790736527,"The Devil's Advocate is a thriller/drama that is neither a chick-flick, nor a spooker. It is the type of show that a 14 year old would enjoy as well as a 70 year old mom/grandmother as well as everyone in between! Although sexual content is there it's ""90's style sexual content"" (which means that it's  light enough imo that it would likely be shown unedited on major network television stations today except for the occasional naked breast).
  K. Reeves was in his peak years acting in this one and Al Pacino is simply a superb actor who can take any movie and turn it into a masterpiece. Fortunately this movie was well written and directed on it's own and would have been a classic in my opinion irregardless of Pacino or not. If you haven't seen this be sure to watch it. It won't be your favorite movie ever... but it will likely end up one that you would watch again someday in the future. A ""classic"" for sure and one of those movies that you would suspect everyone has seen at least one time.",1473292800,3,1001,4.4

A lawyer who is full of himself allows himself to be influenced by by the Devil and what this does to the people around him who are caught up in his fight.  He knows what is right and wrong, but he chooses to do the wrong thing no matter the consequences.  As he says: I am a lawyer, I don't lose, I win, I win, I win.  The movie is well made. Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves are excellent in this movie. They make this movie their own. A wonderful supporting cast just puts this movie over the top. I loved this movie and enjoy watching it over and over. To watch Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves act together is an experience each time I watch the movie.

Basically in each case it looks bad for the defense, then they find a trick which makes their case seem not quite so hopeless, and then it cuts to the client being exonerated.  Real courtrooms don't work this way, there is a lot more complexity and back-and-forth - the testimony of a single witness is not going to immediately win the case.  I wouldn't have minded fewer cases if it meant they could better flesh them out.  The rest of the runtime is filled with the boring and unrealistic interpersonal drama between the protagonist and his wife. Only the last few scenes have any real supernatural elements, and they feel very tacked-on.

121587,5,0790736527,"Al Pacino is a consummate master of his craft and Keanu Reeves always delivers a solid and thoroughly enjoyable performance.
The Diabolical premise is old as the hills, but this particular plot is a brilliant departure from the usual Faustian bargain theme.

The script dispenses with the moth eaten, morality play approach and brings it into the late 20th century for a much needed and spectacular makeover; one that would even make a fashion runway model envious.

The extensive filming in Manhattan and the very gifted supporting cast are skillfully utilized to convey a realistic and accurate glimpse into the life and politics of the Big Apple or any major city around the globe.

Unfortunately, I had issues with the portrayal of Reeve's wife; also an attorney, although of a lesser caliber.
It's not uncommon for some wives to adjust to life in ""the big city"" wherever that may be; when their ambitious husband is promoted by his company to a lofty position that requires a disruptive uprooting of the family.

This is the first time I've been disappointed by Charlize Theron because her character is scripted to behave more like a very sheltered soccer mom rather than a tough, seasoned lawyer with razor sharp smarts . It is the latter assessment that is a more accurate and palatable description of Ms. Theron's approach to acting; and I suspect her private personality as well.

I prefer to fault the director for Ms. Theron's highly erratic and episodic portrayal of an unsophisticated wife behaving like an emotionally unstable and naive ""innocent"" who fell off a turnip truck who cries and complains incessantly about being abandoned; it's absolutely horrendous.

Pacino in his role of the ""Fallen One"" presents the idea that "".....vanity is my favorite vice.""
I think that's questionable and highly subjective; however we must remember that this commentary is based on a centuries old depiction of Moses descending from a mountain with stone tablets; it is a tad cliche.

The film is a voyeurs dream come true and feeds the audience with never ending depictions of life at the pinnacle of Le Haute Monde that are in themselves enticing and enviable as they are sumptuous.
This is ""The Devil Wears Prada"" on a life threatening overdose of illegal steroids.

Pacino delivers an astounding and mind blowing monologue near the end of the film that in itself qualifies as a reason to watch this amazing film. Mr. Pacino's performance convinces you that the Prince of Darkness is capable of making the infamous attorney Roy Cohn in Tony Kushner's ""Angels in America"" (HBO movie version) a siren of sublime delight. Ironically, the role of attorney Cohn is also played by Al Pacino which is an amusing irony to say the least.

How many actors can boast that they can be compared to and be outdone by themselves. Think about that one.",1443657600,2,2841,4.914405010438413

Starring Al Pacino, Keanu Reeves, and Charlize Theron

Reviewed by Author Roy Murry

This intriguing movie about the devil being a lawyer brought all the sins of the world into play. I don't have to name them. Do I?

Reeves, a Southern lawyer and his wife Theron have a hectic but loving family life in a small Florida town. He is a winner; never losing a defense case in his 32 case career. She, the typical caring wife, wants a child and what is best for her husband.

After winning the 32nd case  of a guilty person is over, they get an invitation one does not refuse  a chance to move to Sin City, New York, New York, USA.  He wants the advocate's position because of his vanity and pride, while she is motivated by greed, having things she would never attain in Florida.

Pacino is the owner of a wealthy law firm who dangles the carrots. His background had crossed paths with Reeves mother prior to his birth, and that is the reason for his wanting Reeves in his employ to take over the firm.

The story builds in suspense from the day the couple arrives where they cross paths with all the seven sins, as Reeves mother had experiences when she met Pacino. She became a 'Born Again' Christian because of it.

I don't have to tell you who the devil is. His interface with all the movies characters will give it away from the second act.

The twist in the ending of this not so complicated, but visually compelling movie will keep your eyes looking at the screen. So make certain, there are no distractions when you watch The Devils Advocate.

121633,3,0790736527,"Al Pacino at his most Al Pacino-esque, which is devilishly good.  In ""The Devil's Advocate,"" Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax, a young hot-shot lawyer from Florida invited to join a very successful law firm in New York City by John Milton (Pacino).  Unbeknownst to Kevin, John Milton is actually Satan.  Pacino's wickedly good performance is the highlight of this somewhat dull movie.  The story involves Kevin's descent into a sin and his wife Mary Ann's (Charlize Theron) descent into madness as she sees demons all around her.  All the while, Satan just lays back and watches it all happen, waiting for his chance to realize his plan for Kevin.  This isn't a bad movie.  However, some of the performances by the actors (notably Reeves and Theron) are a bit over-the-top.  While this film will probably not be remembered in any of the actors' repertoires, it is a film worth watching at least once.",1429488000,,898,4.823529411764706

121662,3,0790736527,"If you can avoid feeling bored by the tired old god/goblin bogeyman nonsense that underpins the story, there's enough to enjoy in this movie to make it worth whiling away an hour or two. Pacino turns in a measured performance, avoiding the over-the-top histrionics that make Jack Nicolson's appearances so embarrassing, and Keanu Reeves is well-suited to the ambitious-young-lawyer-still wet-behind-the-ears character around whom the entire plot revolves. Best of all, the script avoids a reliance on CGI and focuses instead on the characters themselves so that there is some human interest rather than just an empty spectacle. There are the usual plot holes typical of Hollywood (everyone in Tinseltown assumes the audience is too brain-dead to keep track of the details or care if things don't properly stack up) but they are relatively minor in the scheme of things. The direction is assured and keeps things moving at the right pace and there's enough decent dialog to keep the viewer engaged even through the stock denouement, which is necessarily something of an anti-climax.

In short, so long as you can tolerate the infantile premise of the movie, it's amusing enough and avoids many of the pitfalls of its genre.",1422576000,,1222,5.14070351758794

121682,4,0790736527,"Supernatural forces hover over the courtroom in this devilish drama adapted from the novel by Andrew Neiderman entitled,The Devil's Advocate.

Attorney Kevin Lomax doesn't heed the Bible-based warnings of his mother ,who views New York City as ""the dwelling place of demons."" Instead, he leaves Gainesville, Florida, with his wife Mary Ann to put his legalistic skills to the test at a leading Manhattan law firm run by John Milton. It all goes smoothly with Milton urging them to stay, putting Kevin on a $400-per-hour salary, and moving the couple into a luxurious apartment in his own building on Fifth Avenue where Mary Ann falls under the influence of neighbor Jackie. After Kevin defends a weird animal sacrificer, he moves up to an important case with an apparent murderer, real-estate tycoon Alexander Cullen. Ignored by Kevin, the troubled Mary Ann has some disturbing experiences, verging on the occult, while Kevin, at work, becomes attracted to redhead Christabella. Dazzled by his entrance into paradise, Kevin doesn't grasp who handed him this Big-Apple success.

This is a highly enjoyable motion picture that's part character study, part supernatural thriller, and part morality play. Or it could be classified as film that is a John Grisham stuff clashed with the Exorcist stuff. The picture's most superlative turn comes from Charlize Theron, who's a revelation in the first role to really show off her talents. But nevertheless,it well-acted by Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves.

(Petals in the Attic.)  I read a couple of these, and became interested in the sort of writer who would write them.  The books
had a cult following.  Turns out, V. C. Andrews was confined to a wheel chair most of her life, never married, and had two brothers,
one quite handsome.  She died in her early 60s, and the family hired a ghost writer in secret to continue the series.  He was
previously a horror story author.  Now he was writing V. C. Andrews-type books in a mincing, little girl manner.  This man was
the author of the novel Devil's advocate, upon which this movie was based.  I was interested in an author who could shift
gears so drastically and so bought the DVD of his movie.
  I found the movie entertaining, but somewhat overwrought.  The first half seemed to drag a bit, and the last part a bit

Two intelligent and notable attorneys cross the same path, while Al Pacino breaks in his newest attorney.

Pacino as the prince of dark humor reigns supreme here, at once mesmerizing & hammy. Reeves demonstrates yet again that he can shout but can't act. Theron, as usual, makes it all work as well as possible.

And yet the perfecton of Al Pacino's portrayal of the Devil. He presented the definitive argument for anyone willing to be more than part of the herd.

The dialogs between Pacino and Reeves are priceless, and even though the movie is portrayed as a dream, it's in fact all real as at the end the master ""sin"" is still being committed.

Some will say Pacino plays Lucifer, others will say he plays Satan, which are two distinctive opposite forces that in our modern day and age have lost their distinctions, but the message is clear, we are the masters of our own present and future.

121730,4,0790736527,"I watched The Devil's Advocate on TV on the evening of Wednesday, the 25th February, 2014. It brought back memories as i loved the film in 1997.

Watching it again, and on TV with the annoying advertisements, a simple truth dawned on me. The film works on many levels and its flaws, are not actual flaws, but clever devices to highlight the fact that society's declining morality is justified through the ""law."" The Pacino character clearly states, ""the law allows me to touch everything and everybody."" He cleverly stays away from Spiritual law.

The Devil's Advocate main strength is that we
""don't see him coming."" Remember, this is the Devil's main advertising tool - I don't exist. The producer cleverly uses our own apathy against us. Read the 1 and 2 Star reviews. I laugh when people write and say ""I worked out quickly that Al Pacino's character John Milton is the Devil.
Dear 1 and 2 Star reviewers -  Uou're supposed to work out that Milton is the Devil. His very name tells you this. People being apathetically lazy forget that Paradise Lost was written by John Milton and Satan is the ""hero"".

The film works on many levels, and, as a student of gnosis, I know that the ego, or their true pluralized form, ""the Ego's"" are the devils platform. Pacino brilliantly talks about this leading up to the death of the managing director - Eddie Barzoum. As the Pacino/Devil says ""you get human desire to the levels where it can split atoms .... and build ego's as big as Cathedrals .... And connect these ego's with Greed, Lust, Envy and in this case the Devil's favourite sin .... Vanity.

The relationship with the main character Kevin Lomax (Keanu) and his beautiful wife (Charlize Thereon) deteriorated whilst in New York, his relationship with his mother - fragile at best - is also in a downward spiral, yet his relationship with his boss/mentor improves. Temptation through vanity is flowing through Kevin's veins. His ego is being massaged - 64 straight wins in Florida - by Milton and he successfully becomes the lead defence lawyer on a triple murder homicide. Kevin can taste the legal victory but cannot save his wife.
Charlize's deterioration:  Charlize also ""sees'. She sees her new female friends in NY in the ""change rooms' whilst trying on new outfits. Naked in the change rooms and touching their bodies sensually she sees their true demonic nature. Charlize sees her new closest BFF's as the demons they truly are, freaks out and leaves.
John Milton:  Charlize starts to see through Milton and she is brutally punished vai mental affliction. These are the scenes that leave us in no doubt, who Milton is. Like Keanu we are drawn in by his master of the universe smile and humanist approach.  Charlize goes from bad to worse mentally, and ends up in a psychiatric wing of a hospital with horrifying consequences.

The relationship with Charlize was Keanu's only real shot at salvation. Love of course being the ""real"" factor within the relationship. Love offsets the selfishness Kevin has been drawn into, even when given an out. Pacino tells him that hhe wil relieve of the case but Keanu onjects. Furthermore, Kevin lusts after a very attractive female partner of whom we discover is his ""sister"". Even whilst making love to his wife he fanatsizes about this partner.. In fact he asks Milton as he is preparing to perform a depraved act, ""what about love?"".... Overrated yells out the Devil ... continue .... and adds quote  ""love is like eating too much chocolate as it affects the same part of the brain.
The Anti-Christ - Kevin is fully wake when Milton tells him quietly that his ""son' will sit at the head of all he tables on earth. Kevin replies ""the anti-Christ"" which Pacino quickly glosses over ...""whatever"" he says. Keanu realizes that he loves his wife, does not want to father the anti-Christ.  Kevin/Keanu reminds ""dad"" that in the Bible, the Devil loses. Kevin doesn't like to lose and makes a bizzare choice. Chick, chick ..... boom.

SPOILER ALERT - do NOT READ the next line if you have not seen the movie released 17 years ago. When Kevin/Keanu kills himself, which is an act of selfishness how can he justify this ? This is my main criticism of the film, as suicide is the ultimate act of selfishness, how can it have redeeming ""selfless"" qualities.

Director's Cut perhaps.-  The ending is weak. I don't like it was all a dream and temptation. It should have borrowed ideas from the by then, ten year old masterpiece Angel Heart. Angel Heart  ends on a morally ambiguous point with horrific results for that films protagonist.  The Devil's Advocate is for the most part, excellent, as its message is morally ambiguity comes across well, yet it fails to deliver this in its ending.

4 Stars - I am being over generous. It could however have been 5 stars if the ending had better been thought out. This is the genius of The Devil's Advocate. The movie comes across as part thriller, part court room drama, part morality tale and part - a fight for one's soul.",1393286400,,5002,4.717889908256881

Hell, I've even seen movies I probably wouldn't have usually liked if he wasn't in them. As if you couldn't tell Al Pacino is my favorite actor.

 Anyway, enough with the rambling about him and onto spewing random thoughts into the review.

 Al Pacino (ahem) is perfect for this role. Going in from the start (due to previews, the cover synopsis, word of mouth) we basically know who Pacino is supposed to be in this movie. What we don't know at first is how the hell Keanu Reeves as Kevin Lomax plays into the whole picture.

 The beginning shows that Reeves wins a difficult court case and grabs the attention of a private firm in New York. Soon he and his wife are whisked up and away, lavished with wealth and all the earthly temptations. Stress and tension rises, the cases remain controversial, and slowly sanity and morals deteriorate.

Reeves is the main character as Kevin. A few people have expressed disappointment with his acting but he doesn't come off as bad to me. He does seem like a similar role in a lot of the films he's in, but I thought he handled all the dramatic scenes quite well and managed to come off as an convincing, determined lawyer who's not good at much else - including marriage. The part where he breaks down showed talent. His southern accent DOES needs work, and it can be pretty inconsistent. The character of Kevin himself isn't really likeable. He comes across as a man trying to climb to the top, morals be damned. The perfect devil's advocate.

 The stunning Charlize Theron portrayed the wife, Mary Anne. Her personality in the movie was fragile but believable; beauty that turns into tragedy. Her declining sanity and almost childlike uncertainty add much. Other actors in the film are Craig T. Nelson (Coach, Poltergiest)as a client, Jeffrey Jones as Eddie, Judith Ivey as the annoying as hell religious mother, and some other well known faces. All carry their own weight and enhance the film.

 This movie can be slightly slow at some points. I never grew bored but some people may if they go in expecting something similar to End of days with non-stop brute force and magical display. This has plenty of time to unravel and the wrapup makes it worth it.

 The movie is laden with trippy images and quick flashes that leave you thinking, WTF? Where's the rewind button? The ending is classic and makes any doubt about the movie worthwhile. This movie also has some steamy sex scenes and nudity.

 The plot itself is from the same name novel by Andrew Neiderman. I have read several of his books, although not this one, and he is a great writer. He went on to ghostwrite the VC Andrews series, but I don't care for his work in that area, too formulated.

 This movie does have its weaknesses. Sometimes you wish for the plot to hurry a bit and for more to happen at a faster pace. The southern accents get tiring after awhile, and the mother Alice is just irritating but thankfully isn't around too much.

 Pacino is the devil himself, the effects were impressive, the music haunting and the buildup (and then release) pleasing.",1379635200,,3398,4.639398998330551

But putting him alongside Pacino worked wonders with him because I believe this is Reeve's best performance to date.  Pacino phones in, but nevertheless has fun playing the Antichrist. This movie is nothing special but if you follow Hitchens or Dawkins & detest religion this movie is ironically a gas. I say ironic because its all about religion but from the perspective down below challenging conventional viewpoints.  It's funny, it's scary, it's sexy, it's tantalizing...it even has a little courtroom drama thrown in for added interest - albeit that area (law) is the metaphor for pure evil (again the irony).

The ending is pretty clever and a nice touch to an overall good movie. Charlize Theron also was good in her role having to show many different emotions.

121792,5,0790736527,"My late-night, bargain rack movie for last night was the ""Devil's Advocate"" DVD starring Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino and found in the five-dollar cheapie rack. It was excellent! Well, I  already knew that because Al Pacino was in it. I mean, have you ever seen a movie with Al Pacino in it that was not  first rate? Well, I haven't.

The ""Devil's Advocate"" was one of those court and lawyer dramas, and I've always sort of liked them. Well, this one started out that same way with Reeves playing a brilliant young attorney who had never lost a case, either as a prosecutor or as a defender. Well, he finally met his match in trying to defend a child molester and he went off totally distraught into the courthouse rest room. To add to his distress a colleague insulted him with a cheap vocal gesture. Then strange things began  to happen. The movie turned somewhat surrealistic, then gradually became ever more so. All of a  sudden he became a number one Florida attorney and was courted by one of the top law firms in New York City. He and his wife were invited to NYC and given the royal treatment. He was hired at the salary of his asking and accommodated with the finest available apartment furnished to his liking. The law firm fell all over themselves in giving him anything he might want. All he needed to do was ask. He began working on some of the biggest, thorniest cases and began to win them, all watched over carefully by Al Pacino, the president of the law  firm. Things just couldn't be any better, but it was bizarre and totally out of the range of the common experience, even for a highly-touted recruit. Then some really  really weird things started happening. Among the very weirdest, it became revealed that Pacino, his boss, was actually his father looking over him and in a  stunningly strange twist, a remarkably beautiful law office employee was a half-daughter of President Pacino. Hold on, it gets weirder. Then Pacino announced that his half-daughter was ovulating and he wanted Reeves, his half-son, to mate with her and for them to bear a child who might take over the law firm upon his retirement. Well, it gets weirder still. My head started spinning from the  whole experience of watching this bizarre story unfold. I began  wondering, ""What is this?"" This story has no credibility at all! I even  considered  shutting it off and going off to sleep. This whole elaborate scenario was just beyond the capabilities of my imagination.

At just about when I was going to give it all up and go to bed, the movie took a final quick and strange twist and I burst out in a muffled laugh and realized I had gone through one of the best movies I had experienced in years. Trust me. This movie was exceptional, but follow it closely and stay with it. Kudos to everyone associated with this film!

  Blu Ray Transfer Quality Review

Despite Amazon's refusal to separate the Standard Def release reviews from the Blu Ray reviews, I did not think that the Standard Def version was a bad release.  That said, the transfer to Blu Ray is an improvement in terms of color resolution and contrast.  There was no perceptible grain and no artifacting, stair-stepping or aliasing in any part of the film.  The Blu Ray video is the star of this transfer with nice details in the shadows and a nicely saturated palate of color.  Skin tones were as they should be as well.

The  lossless audio is DTSHD 5.1  It is the front stage where the audio lives and shines. and while the audio levels are excellent and dialogue is clear and precise, even when the music score comes on, your center channel speaker will get most of the work. There is some small amount of panning across the front stage and light use of your LFE channel.  The rear channels are used primarily for non discreet audio ambience with only one scene in the entire film where discreet channeling to the rears comes to play.  The audio surprised me then as there had been no use of discreet rears throughout.

The Blu Ray version of The Devils Advocate is certainly worth the inexpensive prices it has been going for but, as I said, the standard def version wasn't too bad and the differences between the two are not night and day.  The extras included the typical commentary, some deleted scenes that did not add much to the film and that's about it.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

The Polish is more of a dubbing where you can hear both the English and the Polish at the same time.  The director's commentary is only subtitled in one language (why?) and it is exactly the same commentary as the original DVD.  The most glaring change is the removal of all the extra's about John Milton that are on the DVD that are interesting and made the DVD unusually rich and informative.

In the past, these lower cost, older title Blu-ray's never really impressed me with their grainy, scratchy and hazy picture quality and their less than clean audio quality.

Thankfully, The Devil's Advocate raises the bar and Warner did a great job of bringing this great title to HD. The picture is crisp and sharp, blacks are nice and deep and there is hardly a slight grain at all, even with the sharpness.

The audio is also quite good, and while there are those small scenes where the audio cracks just as on the DVD, it is a great improvement.

Over-all, this release is greatly worth the low cost and for all you other collectors out there, it is time to chuck your old snap case Devil's Advocate and upgrade to Blu!",1348704000,8,831,4.563758389261745
121819,3,0790736527,"When writers pitch their movies to producers, they often say things like, ""This is a cross between ..."" and then they fill in the blanks. For this film they obviously filled in the blanks with Rosemary's Baby and The Firm. Unfortunately, this was not a match made in heaven.

To tell the truth, I liked the film. Al Pacino was perfect as the Devil, and for once I did not mind Keanu Reeves. The production values were wonderful, the sound track compelling, and the directing was tight. The problem, as I stated earlier, was that the match between lawyers and sheer Evil was not made in heaven. Why? Well, first of all, everyone knows what the difference between a catfish and a lawyer is. (One is a scum-sucking bottom-feeder - the other is a fish.) Spelling it out was really not necessary. And everyone also knows what the Devil is (Evil) , so spelling that out (in a very long monologue) was also not necessary.

To have made this film really good, they should have dropped one half or the other of this star-crossed marriage. My choice would have been to drop the overdone legal aspects and concentrate more on the Evil. The special effects (women turning into demons) were excellent - the movie simply needed more along those lines. The plot, accordingly, needed to revolve less around various courtroom ethical dramas - all of which have been dealt with in other films at great length - and more on the personal drama. As it was, it was difficult to get too invested in the marital problems encountered by the Lomaxes.

All in all, I'd say this movie was entertaining and worth watching if you have an evening to kill. Just don't set your expectations too high.",1348617600,2,1667,4.606060606060606

The main difference is that the first sign that a 20th Century Fox DVD will rot will be a blueish tint that slowly spreads all over the disk's shiny surface).

I bought this item on Sept 2008. The first thing that happened, after some time went by (a year or so), was that the DVD refused to play the second layer; initially, the reproduction was uneven and jumpy, which points at another problem different from DVD-rot: DELAMINATION.

This means the layers that compose a DVD are slowly ungluing from each other due to poor manufacturing processes. The layers warp, creating the uneven play and very soon DVD-rot will set in.

My plans are to stop purchasing products from Warner altogether. From now on, I'll scroll down and have a look at who made the film: if it says either ""Warner"" or ""20th Century"", I'll simply avoid that particular movie.",1346716800,5,1097,4.558375634517766

121830,2,0790736527,"I hate Keanu Reeves.

I have no shame in saying this, since all sane people feel the same way.  That isn't to say that he hasn't starred in some good movies.  The original `Matrix' was a very good film that still holds up today, and `Dracula' is one of the finest horror films ever made.  Still, regardless of his filmography (which really isn't entirely impressive to be honest) he is a horrid actor who hasn't EVER delivered a `great' or even `good' performance.

That really dampens the appeal that `The Devil's Advocate' could have had.  Add to the mix a hammed up Al Pacino and you have a film that could have used a different ensemble (well, you can keep Charlize Theron) in order to be truly inspired.  The storyline isn't anything remarkable, and the whole `Satan is a lawyer' is kind of obvious, but the spirited art direction and slick visuals could have made for an engaging thriller.  The screenplay doesn't try hard enough to do anything special, and that ending is a total copout (LAZY).  Sadly, Pacino relishes too much in the over the top, and while some seem to be lauding this choice I find it far too on the nose of who he has become as an actor.  It's like Jack Nicholson playing the Joker; too obvious.  Theron is a beauty, even in her early stardom, and Connie Nielson will make you drop your jaw; but at the end of the day this one gets drug down by its mismatched co-stars, one of which bores you to tears and the other who seems to think every word is a piece of steak he needs to gnaw to death.",1339545600,2,1520,4.3546099290780145

Here is a great one for you Pacino fans!

Al is infatuatedly hypnotizing as Satan (the supernatural Godfather), undercover as the head of a large successful lawyer's firm in NYC. Pacino is funny, charming, & devious, as he weaves & woes his victims in this film, with devilish glee! He recruits Keanu Reeves to be his next big hot shot lawyer, or at least that is what Keanu thinks. What follows is taught, surrealistic ride, where everything is not as it seems, & Satan has plans to challenge God one more time for the world of man.

 Shades of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" saturate this film, but it is not a knock off, but a heavily influenced film of that great movie, that can stand on it's own two cloven hoofs. It is, in my opinion, the best film influenced by Roman Polanski's masterpiece, & though a lesser film, it's not by much!

121837,3,0790736527,"With DEVIL'S ADVOCATE we have the ultimate serving of weak sauce.  Keanu Reeves has as much range as a snail on an ice cube; here he plays a ""can't lose"" Southern barrister suddenly recruited to a big-time Manhattan law firm.  Charlize Theron plays the apprehensive wife--the insecure, clinging frump who quickly unravels once the couple moves to the Big Apple, and who starts to discover the devil's in the details.  Al Pacino plays Lucifer--more on that later.  And all of this utter nonsense whirls chaotically towards the Showdown:  the confrontation between Keanu's petulant character and Beezlebub--in an oversized office with moving sculptures on the walls.  The scheming Satan calls forth a sizzling Connie Nielsen (wolf howl) to seduce Keanu, which (of course) will produce the Grandson Antichrist bent to destroy the world; to cement the seduction Frank Sinatra music is piped in.

No, I'm not making this up.  If I had, I would be even more messed up than the circumstances of DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.  Again, weak sauce, but. . .

Al Pacino is absolutely delightful.  Playing uber lawyer John Milton (oh, you gotta love that irony), Pacino is rowdy, incorrigible, maniacal, malevolent, abhorrent, charming, and often witty to the max.  Sporting yellow teeth the length of a Madagascar rodent and an evil smirk that would peel plaster, the viewer can tell Pacino relished this role as the sulking and ornery Evil One.  Pacino dominates every scene he's in, which is darn good; otherwise there wouldn't be a film to salvage, making the DEVIL'S ADVOCATE CD a grand frisbee to throw about the living room.

This is a supernatural thriller despite a superficial plot that is reminiscent of Grisham's ""The Firm.""  There are enough surprises to keep the viewer guessing, and this is a snappy, stylish flick.  Reeves is superb, and Pacino turns in his customary excellent performance.

I said that I disagree with the film's moral message, and I do.  An attorney has a duty to do his or her best, and defense attorneys cannot always defend innocent clients.  In fact, criminal defense attorneys rarely defend innocent, let alone blameless, clients.  What are they supposed to do, lose on purpose?

Granted the special effects don't measure up to today's wowing computer graphics, but the talent of the cast made up for it.  How I wish that Paramount had caught the true potential and had committed to it.  What a series it would have been!

In this episode, Star Trek was at its best.  The tensions between McCoy and Spock in this case, disagreeing over life based on silicon vs carbon.  And between Spock and Kirk over the dangers of new beings vs the sanctity of preserving life.  Definitely the strength of Star Trek was in the heart of the relationships between the three main characters and their actor counterparts.

The movie has some enjoyable parts--Al Pacino hams it up as the devil, but he does so in a funny/enjoyable way bordering on self parody.  It wasn't the strongest acting from him by any stretch but it was certainly still good acting and it fitted the movie; over the top, cheesy but still enjoyable.
Reeves was wooden, no surprise, but it was a pain.  I wish they'd gotten someone else for his role. He's one of the worst big name actors out there and he did drag the movie down.

As far as plot goes...well, I'm torn.  The movie was a transparent morality play and fairly predictable but still enjoyable to watch--you knew what would happen, and how it would wind up, but you could still enjoy the show.  You weren't left counting down the minutes till it was over and it didn't drag much. The pacing was well done and until the end, although it was predictable it wasn't a groaner.  I guess, in food terms (I'm hungry!) I'd liken it to a meal at a fast food resturant. You know more or less what you'll get, you know it isn't high art but it can still hit the spot.  You just have to forgive the flaws and enjoy the ride.",1186099200,5,1281,4.225409836065574

Greed for money and excessive hours of work are common complaints about ""BIG LAW"" in blogs.  This movie brings all those complaints to life with an outrageous plot.  Al Pacino is the head of an international New York firm that is BIG, and he's the devil!  The acting by Pacino is great.  As a current Florida resident, I can tell you that Reeves does not sound like a real southerner from the SEC region.  (Although his mother does).

121870,5,0790736527,"This movie is actually a shocking wake up call in the moral department. If you follow my reviews, you know that I dislike modern shoot em up movies. But setting this aside, it is interesting how many movies inspire the wrong values. (Shoot everybody up, take down who stands in your way, fall in love, and live happily ever after. I could go on and on, but so many movies fall into this category.) Well, ""The Devil's Advocate"" seems to be a reaction against the amoral filth that often comes out of the movie theatres. The basic theme of this movie according to its director is: ""Do I do the right thing, or do I survive?""

The story starts at a  courtroom in Florida. Lawyer Kevin Lomax realizes that his client is really guilty, but after a bit of taunting, he gets his client off anyway, and it's not hard to see that satisfying his ego was the main reason he did so. Well, Kevin gets an offer from a law firm in New York City to pick a jury for a client who DID steal millions. Again, Kevin comes through. The leader of this city firm John Milton (Al Pacino) then offers Kevin a job with a tempting salary. So far, this all seems part of the 'American Dream.' (Play some moral games to get to the top if you need to.) Apparently Kevin has gotten there, but the story is FAR from over. Sadly, some vital scenes were deleted for the purpose of time. (One is where Al Pacino says: ""Leave morals to God. We have a job to do."" Another sadly deleted scene is where Kevin's wife Mary Anne is sent into a room where sexual amoral games are going on.)

At the risk of over simplifying a bit, with Al Pacino's well timed appearances, it becomes clear that the more moral games Kevin is willing to play, the further he can go. It is interesting that about half way through the movie, Kevin starts to treat his moral and religious mother with disrespect, and that the marriage between Kevin and Mary Anne starts to have serious problems. An obvious example is when Mary Anne gets a beautiful cut and dye hair job,  but Kevin calls it: 'radical' and 'traumatic.' Why? He already has his eyes on other women. (Notably Christa Bella.) Another sadly deleted scene is where it was obvious that if Christa Bella had been present at the dance club, Kevin would have been willing to engage in adultery. The once happy marriage with Mary Anne has become a burden to him. (This is obvious when during a phone call, he lies to her about being at work and starts to get very short with her.)

Well, Kevin continues to take the money as well as other things, at the expense of his morals. It is not until he realizes that his new client Alexander, IS guilty of several murders that his conscience starts to wake up. But even if our conscience has awakened, will we listen to it, or will we survive? Kevin realizes that after you have played too many moral games, backing out isn't so easy. And it isn't long before he realizes that Al Pacino is in fact the DEVIL. Perhaps the most frightening moment in this movie is when Kevin tries to blame the devil for everything that happened to him, and the devil can HONESTLY reply: ""Wait a minute. Who MADE those decisions?""

Another frightening thing about this movie is that we probably all have played moral games in our lives, and this movie confronts us with things we are probably ALL guilty of. Forget the grotesque devils and demons in horror movies who can make you do things. Any priest or nun will say that evil is simply the absence of God. And if the devil did make an appearance, he could very well appear fatherly and likable. And he probably would say things that SOUND good. This movie is proof that in horror, blood and guts are laughable compared to frightening truth that we may wish to avoid.",1165536000,65,3734,4.396526772793053

121872,5,0790736527,"From the director of Ray, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is a movie that almost everyone has seen. It's a movie that has about everything a movie can fit;

Good plot, solid twists, horror/gore, drama, comedy, great performances, and lots of sex and nudity. The movie stars Oscar winners Al Pacino (Best Actor, ""Scent of a Woman"") and Charlize Theron (Best Actress, ""Monster""), as well as Keanu Reeves ('Speed') in performances that could've easily garrnered them Oscar nominations. The movie begins with us meeting Kevin Lomax (Reeves), an ace lawyer who is defending a teacher who has apparently molested one of his students. Despite knowing that the man is guilty, Lomax wins the case and at an after party is approached for a job opportunity in New York. With his wife Mary Ann (Theron) in tow, Lomax heads to New York where he meets John Milton (Pacino), who (and pardon the reference) makes Lomax an offer he can't refuse. Pretty soon, Lomax is handling Milton's firms biggest cases and lives in a beautiful apartment; But things are falling apart. Mary Ann is slipping into insanity, have hallucinations and such; And Kevin can't stop thinking about a co-worker named Christabella (Connie Nielsen, who once again manages to disappear into the role). In case you hadn't figured this out by the title, Milton also happens to be the devil. And that's all I can really say about the plot. The movie runs 142 minutes, without the credits, and there are times where it feels overbloated; Like certain scenes could've been trimmed. But overall, especially with the perfectly over-the-top performance from Pacino, the movie is satisfying and entertaining enough. The final plot twist is a bit stupid, but it doesn't matter because it occurs three seconds before the film ends. The dialogue, especially the speeches that we hear mostly from Pacino, is spectacular. With the help of composer James Newton Howard ('Batman Begins'), this is one of director Taylor Hackford's best films.

To know what scene I'm talking about, watch the film! Keanu shows that he does have acting ability in some scenes.

Al Pacino is the perfect choice for playing Satan. He's everything you'd expect the devil in human form to look like. A smooth talker for sure. Pacino does a great job, it is very easy to believe what his character is saying and take whatever he says as fact. Once again I say, a greatly skilled actor like Al was the perfect choice and he is the one that really cares the movie all the way through to the end.

'The Devil's Advocate' is a very entertaining story about fame and vanity and the evil places it can lead one to. Keano Reeves does a fine job portraying the young attorney. Charlize Theron is phenomenal as his pretty wife. But it is Al Pacino who (not surprisingly) steals the show, acting out the mysterious and strange boss.

As the movie reaches its' climax, Reeves and Pacino confront each other in a scene that's gotta rank up there with one of the greatest in motion picture history. Pacino's diatribe about God is simply brilliant.

My only criticism of this film is the overdone goriness of some of it's scenes and the unecessary lewdness portrayed. If you have the stomach to sit through some of that, you will be absolutely mesmerized by this well-plotted and well-acted film. Absolutely Reccomended.",1145232000,4,1383,4.659836065573771

But somewhere, the shadow of Satan is lurking.

Keanu Reeves plays Lomax, Charlize Theron plays Maryanne, and Al Pacino is absolutely terrifying as Milton, in Taylor Hackford's ""Devil's Advocate"", one of the scariest, most bonechilling horror films ever made.

Brilliantly written, superbly acted (this is by far's Keanu's best performance to date) and genuinely disturbing, this is by far the best horror film I've ever seen. And it is also the best portrayal of the Devil I've ever seen. It is the most realistic portrayal, which makes it more disturbing than it's meant to be.

To tell you the truth, this movie is in my top 15 of all time right now. It is wonderfully made and is trully unforgettable.

Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a hot shot lawyer in Florida living with his gorgeous wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). The opening scene is wonderfully though out and includes an event crucial to the movie (that you'll figure out later on). Lomax has spent his life putting criminals away and releasing them. He doesn't care what they've done but he does care about hi paycheck. When he gets a huge offer..he moves to New York with his wife where John Milton (Al Pacino) is his mentor. Lomax now trully has the perfect life..right?

Milton turns out to be more than Lomax bargained for but Lomax stands blinded while his wife is made out as being insane by all that she claims to see.

The ending has an ingenious twist and gives the movie a terrific finish. The movie ends out being extremely powerful and thought provoking and left me thinking one thing.

Can you ever evade sin?

The Devil's Advocate is a daring thriller with clever courtroom trials and so much more. Pacino obviously had a blast doing this movie and really made it even more worthwile.

He shouts too much in this flick and he leers so much and is so personally repellent that most people would've run away from him instead of being tempted.

Keanu Reeves is a one note actor. He does one thing but he does it well: no-one else can play the stupid and/or ignorant guy who thinks he has it all together better than Keanu. That's what he does here. His character is amoral but not mean.. He's greedy but not cruel and he loves his wife in spite of being clearly frustrated by her small town ways and mental problems. He's easily led and the battle of course, is to see who's going to get Keanu's soul.

Devil's Advocate, of course, is the film that depicts Satan as a New York lawyer and the good 'ol boy from the South as a the ambitious next-demon-to-be.  Keanu Reeves concentrates on delivering lines as he portrays Kevin, the tough defense lawyer from Florida who's never lost a case.  He's lured up to NYC by Al Pacino's evil law firm, which is staffed by a variety of demons who are also top lawyers.  The firm is involved 'in everything', so therefore, we can safely assume it's sufficiently evil.

Pacino plays Satan with his usual gusto, a tad paler with some makeup so he sometimes looks half-dead, and to top it off we get a complete monologue by Satan, a veritable defense of his actions.  The full cynicism of the writers and Hollywood in general seeps through as Al booms on God, about man, and then, moments later when his plans backfire, he starts screaming and the room blows up and...

Cheesy, but completely watchable for Al's dedication with extra ham, and for the general effort of making a film about Satan being a New York lawyer.",1116979200,,1196,4.6084905660377355

*  The secondary storyline of Charlize Theron's mental breakdown.  It didn't go anywhere, didn't add anything and could have been substituted for more courtroom hijinks in a heartbeat.

*  Keanu Reeves as the junior attorney.  Totally miscast.  I love Keanu in roles where he's suited for the part -- ""The Matrix"" comes to mind -- but when he's miscast he's *terribly* miscast.

*  The vacuity of some of Pacino's lines.  Listen closely to the Eddie Barzoon monologue and you'll hear nothing but extremely well-delivered banalities.  Ditto for large swaths of Pacino's closing monologue, although his ending speech has a few lines that are so good they make up for the rest.

I've seen several of his movies and he's worked with some really talented actors and directors but he never seems to really convey emotion or atleast enough so that I can feel it, until now. I would assume that Pacino and of course Taylor Hackford ( the director ) have alot to do with that. They definitely brought up his game.  And I have to mention Charlize Theron who I always thought was nothing more than a pretty face but she's much more. She's really really terrific here as well and she certainly has you the viewer feeling for her and what she's going threw.  This movie is a hellish ride that I enjoy taking over and over again.",1111881600,6,1187,4.361990950226244
121890,5,0790736527,"""The Devil's Advocate"" has been demonized by many as just another ""over the top"" film by Al Pacino. It is, and then some.  However, it's a smart, funny, guilty pleasure that does have depth to it. The central theme of the film, in a nutshell is; God is not what he's been hyped up to be, and Satan is ""more down to Earth""; and maybe the tide is turning and Satan's time on Earth has finally arrived.

This is all packaged into a story about an attorney named Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) practicing criminal law in the ""Redneck Riviera"" of Florida, Gainesville, only to get tapped to practice law in a prestigious New York law firm, headed by John Milton (Al Pacino).  Kevin is offered every temptation possible by Milton, and he doesn't say no too often. It turns out that Milton is Satan, and knows just the right buttons to push on Kevin (greed, vanity) to keep him interested. Milton has other plans for Kevin, but keeps a carrot dangling in front of him throughout the film, until Milton has finally groomed his young protege for his real purpose.

The dialogue is funny and at the same time stays on point; Satan's time is coming and ""God is an absentee landlord."" This is a fun film, whose writer definitely has a perspective on religion, judging from the themes and some of the monologues in the film. However, it is all served up in an engaging manner.

The Devil's Advocate comes highly recommended, with many memorable lines.  This is a very watchable film that can be seen over and over again. While Pacino's performance is over the top (purposely, and it's perfect), the real star is the writing and the dialogue.

Also starring Charlize Theron, and Jeffrey Jones.",1111276800,4,1675,4.600671140939597
121891,5,0790736527,"It is teh story of a lawyer who is working for the devil, but the film is much more than that it advocates the devil as unescapable. A successful provincial lawyer is integrated in the New York lawfirm of the devil himself who wants to have the best lawyers in order to get as many guilty people acquitted to fill the world with criminals and other evil people. There are many twists in the story but altogether the young lawyer is going to discover that he cannot go on with his work there because he does not want to sacrifice, that's the price, all his private life and even his soul, to have power and money. He is thus insensitive to the argument of domination, his domination over the world. In other words he lacks ambition in a way, that passion that is so cannibalistic that you have to eat everything that is dear to you to satisfy it, even your own mother if necessary. It shows society is full of such people. It is a criticism of society at this level. So the young lawyer decides to drop out of a case he was sure to win when he realizes his client is guilty and that he cannot defend that kind of guilt since if he is acquitted he will move to a real murder and not only a sexual offense, on teenage girls. But, and here the film becomes the advocate of teh devil, if this young man refuses ambition, power, money, then he can be tempted another way and this time in his little provincial city : the devil uses vanity as the bait to his trap. And it works in no time. In other words the devil is nothing really. In society there will always be someone to tempt you with one passion or another, they used to call that sins, and you will give in. The devil is not an extraneous being but he is part and parcel of the human constitution in society. Human society is a constant array of temptations to any person to be different, to become more something and anything, powerful, famous, rich, even more virtuous and that will lead to more passion in society, it will emulate a lot of imitators and competition. The devil will thus triumph easily. The film does not say how we can stop him. Maybe there is no way.

121892,4,0790736527,"There is an old saying that in a court-of-law it is irrelevant what the truth is.  What DOES matter is the calibre of the lawyers that reside on both sides of the judiciary fence.  This movie takes that dictum and pushes it to the edge of the envelope.

One of the most intriguing facets of the storyline is an implicit question that the film compels us to ask ourselves:  Who is worse off?  A prosecutor who is  so good that he gets an innocent man executed or put away for life?  Or a defense lawyer who is so good that he gets a guilty man off the hook, after which time he hurts or kills someone else?  It is a question that must enter the minds of all who exercise the art of legalistic oratory at some point or other.

Al Pacino is without question the highlight of the flick.  It is obvious that he takes great delight in playing the devil himself, and it shows in his performance.  It is a role that is ideally suited to his demeanor.  A nice touch was making his name John Milton, which is an allusion to the English poet who authored PARADISE LOST.  This is the poem that detailed Satan's fall from heaven as well as Adam & Eve's fall from the Garden of Eden.  As a sidenote, I would HIGHLY recommend PARADISE LOST;  there are a couple of references to the work itself during the story.

It was rather painful to see Keanu Reeves occasionally try to fake a southern accent, but this was not his worst performance.  There is a surprising amount of nudity in the film, and that's always a good thing.  This is ESPECIALLY true in any film which features Charlize Theron!

All in all this is a fun film to pick up, especially if you're into the Faustian man-selling-his-soul-to-Satan genre.  While the ending is a bit deus ex machina, the balance of the DVD makes up for the weak finale.",1107907200,27,1793,4.327327327327327

I believe this movie to be truly exceptional, but I understand that all are not me, thus this movie may not be everyone's favorite, as it is mine, yet I have not found someone who was not taken aback by its stunning detail. I strongly recommend that this movie is at least watched once by all, and I believe that it would make a great addition to most people's collection. I do not want to spoil any part of the movie by going into detail, so I will keep it simple, this movie must be seen, it is unlike other movies, and due to this uniqueness, that you will notice, maybe not enjoy, but certainly notice, there are grounds for viewing Devil's Advocate. If you are worried about Keanu Reeves performance, even he does a good job for himself.  A final compliment to close my review, I believe this movie unlike any other, truly exceptional, truly cinematic, truly one of Al Pacino's best performances, and truly worth seeing.

121895,4,0790736527,"This provocative thriller is based on a book by Andrew Neiderman, and while the movie does well, it's quite different from the novel----almost making it two different stories with the same theme.

Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax, a hotshot Florida attorney who's unbeaten track attracts the attention of a high power New York law firm.  He packs up his wife (Charlize Theron) and off he goes, not realizing that his new boss is not quite what he seems....he's the devil.

Reeves is wooden for most of the movie, but he manages to pull out a believable performance by the end, so he doesn't bring the film down.  Al Pacino as Satan is wonderful, energizing his role with demonic glee and self assuredness.  Theron is very good in one of her earlier roles, playing the neglected wife who descends into madness, helped along by Reeves' conniving boss.  A red-headed Connie Nielsen is seductively effective as Christabella, a sexy siren who wants in Reeves' pants.  Jeffrey Jones and Craig T. Nelson also star in unimpressive roles.

Director Hackford keeps the pace interesting, up to a rather surprising climax.

It's interesting that Satan has chosen the legal profession to promote his schemes, but since lawyers are often considered demons, one can see why.

121896,5,0790736527,"Keanu Reeves' best performance yet -- and even better is the chemistry between him and his wife played by Charlize. They meet up again in ""Sweet November"".

Wow, if you ever doubted Keanu's acting abilities - this movie will make you think twice. Al Pacino does an excellent job of portraying the devil. I watched this movie again after watching it once 7 years ago. It's even better to see a second time around.

I still think that Jack Nicholson was more convincing as the devil in ""Witches of Eastwick"". Al Pacino is almost too charming to be the man downstairs.",1099785600,4,565,4.584158415841584
121897,4,0790736527,"I absolutely adore this movie, although I'm a little iffy on Al Pacino and I always get him muddled up with Robert De Niro for some reason. He does a brilliant job of playing Satan, Lucifer, the Devil, John Milton, little old man, the Antichrist, the main man, whatever you wanna call him. It also stars a bumbling idiot (Jeffrey Jones), the lovely Keanu Reeves, the equally lovely Charlize Theron, and small but almost painful scenes featuring Heather Matarazzo. Keanu has a rather severe hair cut in this, whereas Charlize's hair looks so much better longer.

Keanu & Charlize have great chemistry in this, they're newly weds and still in the first throes of love. You can just tell their characters are wanting to rip off each other's clothes and christen every room - twice! They both starred again in Sweet November.

The film is roughly 2 hours long - unless you're like me and skip the scene where Eddie Barzoon gets killed, as it's pointless and unnecessary to the whole film, much like the character. This may be off-putting for some people, but the film absolutely flies by and you're wanting the story to continue.

Charlize quickly descends in schizophrenia in this movie and to prepare for her disturbing role in the film, she spent an hour a day over the three-month shooting period in NYC with a psychotherapist to ""practice schizophrenia"". She plays it magnificently, although the ill fitting brown wig doesn't suit her, and you really feel for her throughout most of the film. She's in a strange town, with an empty apartment to fill, and her hubby hasn't been home long enough to ""knock her up"". She also starts thinking that John Milton slept with her when he didn't, and ends up her taking her own life. One of the best scenes in this movie, it proves to any doubters that Keanu Reeves really can act! (There's a lot of them out there, believe me)

Al Pacino joins a long line of great actors in incarnating the Antichrist in the name of entertainment, including: Robert De Niro (in Angel Heart), Jack Nicholson (in The Witches Of Eastwick), Gabriel Byrne (in End Of Days) and even Sam Neill (in Omen III: The Final Conflict).

This movie will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, that's how powerful and disturbing it is. There's full frontal nudity from Charlize and Connie Nielsen for the guys, and we girls only get to see Keanu from the waist up (boo).

121901,4,0790736527,"""The Devil's Advocate"" is one of those movies that you can't stop thinking about after it's finished.  Scenes keep replaying through your head.  It's a movie that makes you think, despite it's strange, fantasy-like plot-line.  Al Pacino, without a doubt, delivers one of the best and most potent performances of his career.  Keanu Reeves isn't up to his usual standard of acting, but he plays wooden characters very well.  Once again, in ""The Devil's Advocate"", Keanu is wooden.  That's alright though, it really doesn't take anything away from the story line.  It doesn't matter who the director intended to be the movies main character; Pacino steals the show, but don't get me wrong.  He has his competition.
Charlize Theron delivers a performance the caliber of which I didn't think she was capable.  She portrays the stages of madness through which her character stumbles through very accurately, cryptically, and passionately.  Her character (Keanu Reeves' wife) is slowly isolated and cut off from her husband through the doing Pacino, who uses the seven deadly sins to manipulate Keanu and keep him as far away from his wife as possible while at the same time manipulating her with a various assortment of devilish tricks.
The dialogue in this movie is incredible.  The conversations in this movie alone are worth watching.  Pacino generally has the most thought-provoking lines in the film, though Keanu's mother and Theron have their moments.  I can't think of a single flaw in the character chemistry and interactions within this movie.  It's perfect.  Half the movie you feel your stomach writhing and twisting as you find yourself thinking and re-evaluating issues and aspects of your life you'd either forgotten about or taken for granted.  These aren't the only time in which you'll feel your stomach doing helixes in your bowels, however.
For the other half of the movie, your insides will squirm with discomfort.  This movie is one of the most R rated movies I've ever seen.  Chalked full with graphic images including nudity, horror, blood/guts, violence and dialogue that includes some seriously disturbing topics, this movie becomes increasingly difficult to sit through as you go on.  The director makes it very clear he's not sparing the viewer for anything.  The camera rarely ever cuts or zooms in during the appropriate moments.  Instead, he captures everything in startling detail.  For instance, a suicide scene in which a character slits their throat is very, very graphic and terrifyingly realistic.  Another scene of sequence of violence goes back and forth between Pacino talking about humans greed and a character in the movie being beaten to death by two demons (supposedly sent by Al Pacino).  Other examples of disturbing images would be a series of scenes that feature Charlize Theron, one in which you see her completely nude with large gashes and slashes across her body, and another scene which could easily be classified as horror and is too difficult to really describe.  It suffices to say that it involves Charlize Theron and a baby child within a conjured halucination of Pacino's; yet another way of driving Theron's character mad.
When these two elements combine, it makes for a compelling and thought provoking film pot-holed with graphic imagery and disturbing themes.  Even the climax of the movie includes an impressive amount of nudity, sexual content and violence.  Despite all of this though, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is a very worth-while and ultimately poweful film, if not completely comfortable to watch all the way through.  I don't recommend this movie for family viewing or young children.  It's a movie that you need to mentally prepare for, and perhaps have an ""antidote"" movie lined up, perhaps a good-hearted comedy.  There is one more good thing I can say for this movie; it has a satisfying ending.  It's a film where the ending could make or break the entire feel of the movie.  If you're going to sit through a movie that feels twice as long as it is with the constant assaults on your senses and comfort with controversy, adult themes and disturbing images, you're holding out for a good ending.  Well, without a doubt, ""The Devil's Advocate"" delivers.  In short, this movie is worth seeing simply for it's thought-provoking dialogue and plot-line.",1089504000,5,4315,5.056577086280057
121902,4,0790736527,"Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a success in the courtroom and out of it. He's a young Florida defense attorney who has never lost a case. No matter how repugnant the crime, no matter how guilty the defendant, Kevin Lomax has the power to mesmerize the jury into accepting his arguments, buying into his logic, being convinced by his charisma; and freeing his clients. Soon after he has successfully won the case, where he defended an obviously guilty child molester, Lomax is invited to New York, where a powerful law firm has become aware of the Florida hotshot's acquittal record. Here he meets John Milton (Al Pacino), the founder and head of ""Milton, Chadewick, Waters"", a mysterious and powerful law firm with contacts and clients all over the world. It is this charismatic and charming man that opens the door to a completely different world; a world of luxury and pleasure, wealth and power; a world of endless possibilities. This is heaven on earth. But as Lomax tastes the power of being a wealthy New York attorney, something in him changes. Winning is no longer just a goal; it becomes an obsession. Soon he starts to realize that things are not what they seem to be; and all the things he once had and cared about -a happy marriage with Mary Ann (Charlize Theron), his relationship with his mother, all his happiness - everything disappear amidst the sparkling illusion of paradise. He suddenly realizes that Heaven and Hell can co-exist at the same place and at the same time.
I do not intend to reveal anything else, since all of the interesting surprises will be presented in the intense and inspiring climax. This is probably Reeves' best performance. He manages to create a believable character - a kind of example, a role model for the American way of life. Kevin's wife, Mary Ann, is most likely the hardest character to play, since she goes through a complex and difficult emotional evolution. From being strong, devoted and ambitious (a female copy of her husband) to vulnerable, hurt and on the verge of madness. Charlize Theron gracefully floats into this character. The most interesting of performances and characters is John Milton - the essence of Kevin Lomax's temptation. Al Pacino is nothing less than astonishing, an award worthy performance that is as good as anything seen this year.

Keanu Reeves, who's usually a staid one-expression wonder fit for movies like Speed and Matrix, pitches in quite a remarkably absorbing performance here. Which was a pleasant surprise! Pacino needless to say  is stellar as usual in his macabre role as Satan.
But the cake goes to Charlize Theron who fits the wife's character like a glove (a role that is never really clearly defined) and fills in some pretty yawning gaps, creating a gradual descent into madness which actually seems realistic enough to be taken seriously.

Good movies shouldn't be about spectacle, they should be about storytelling; this one succeeds somewhat, although it's not helped by having Keanu Reeves play the lead.  He's competent, but uninteresting.  No, the real stars of this movie are the set/casting/production departments, make no mistake.
And having Pacino mime Sinatra's ""It Happened In Monterey"" was nothing short of genius--I laughed out loud in the theatre, and I wasn't alone.
The downsides of this DVD are definitely the lack of options with the extended scenes; why they decided to cram Taylor Hackford's commentary down our throats on that one, I have no idea.

121910,2,0790736527,"The plain and simple truth is that Keanu Reeves can't act. Never could, but somehow this inability was disguised until ""Devil's advocate"". But Reeves' characterization of a southerner lawyer turn into a hotshot in one of the most preeminent firms in New York (was it NY? Don't remember) is, to say the least, pitiable. There's one scene in special that embarrassed me, and I kept thinking that this guy is in fact being paid millions to do that. Well, the blame should be divided with the director, the person responsible for the casting and with millions of spectators that still think he's an actor.
Aside from that, ""Devil's advocate has many other flaws. Al Pacino as John Milton/The Evil One is laughable. And I like Pacino. If Satan was half as idiotic as Pacino portraits it, the world would be an eternal rainbow-sunshine scene. The plot of this movie is so thin I already forgot it. All other characters (with the exception of the two women) are just ridiculous sidekicks in the unfinishable story of the battle of Good against evil. I can't remember one single actor in this movie other than Reeves, Pacino, Theron and Nielsen. The final confrontation scene and the whole situation it involves is so grotesquely scripted that the movie looses even the aura of  ""fable"", something that could save parts of the story.
I give ""Devil's advocate"" two stars because of Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen. The south african is extremely beautiful, and a competent actress that draws attention whenever she's on screen.

Al Pacino delivers as always, and Charlize Theron showcased some of her acting talent (and her body).  Keanu Reeves was horrible, horrible, horrible, but isn't he always?
Overall, this is a good movie about good versus evil and points out certain mysteries/paradoxes of the Christian mythical tradition.  The story is a simple allegory, and there are some unexplained holes that will require some significant suspension of disbelief.  It is not incredibly deep - that is, it won't change your world view - and one of Pacino's monologues is sort of vapid and choppy, but overall it is a good movie.  The ending after Satan's last monologue is disappointing and contrived, so beware the final 5 minutes.  If you're like me, you may find yourself rooting for the bad guy.

Overall, a great film that does a good job of showing the devil's temptations and how he finds his niche in the universe.

In the end the whole movie is invalidated with the posed question of whether or not this could happen. Keanu gets to see his characters future if he chooses to allow a child molester to get off in court and return to the moment of when he made his pact with the Devil, in a sense.
The concept of the pact being made when he turned his back on what was truly right had bite but it undermined the whole movie. Can no one's character ever be irredeemable unless one is the destined to die villain? Can't American audiences handle the fact that not every story has a happy ending? Charlize Theron plays a housewife slowly crumbling under the onslaught of evil but the fact that she does so also undermines her character as anything but a victim.
There is possibility to the film but it is lost to a contrived Hollywood ending.",1045699200,3,1003,4.427027027027027

That's not the only thing. This movie did a pretty good job on most things, but was just a tad off in a couple of parts, like the way that it portrayed Satan to be omnipresent, which he isn't. (Job 1) This is not a kid movie, and probably something that you wouldn't want to watch with your mother. The R rating reflects a hefty amount of nudity (some sexual, some non-sexual), some sexuality, profanity and violence. Being that all of that stuff is unnecessary for a great movie, the t.v. version is better to watch, especially when watching it with other people. It's a lot less uncomfortable.

121916,5,0790736527,"Devil's Advocate is a well-written and well made film. Director Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman) controls his cast and camera well. The performances from Al Pacino and Charlize Theron are so strong, that they even bring Keanu Reeves up--yes, Keanu's acting is bad, and that accent is one of the worst I've heard--but with Pacino and Theron (and Connie Nielsen) surrounding him, it's easy to overlook. And the Devil's Advocate is a morality play. This isn't some effects monster, it's a story about right and wrong and the choices we make. It's a great film.
The dvd contains a commentary track from the director, and it is one that is informative and entertaining. And there are something like over 30 minutes of extended scenes, but most of what is there is in the film. You see where he has cut snippets from scenes, and in reality, there are only a few deleted scenes here. Unfortunately the only way you can watch them is with a director's commentary. You just want the director to shut up, so that we can hear what is cut (most of what is cut is dialog, and you can't see how effective or not it is without the volume). And since the director feels that some of these are very important scenes, you'd think we would have an option to watch them without commentary. In addition to trailers, there are also notes on: cast & crew, special effects, the devil, John Milton (the poet, not the character), sin, and location.",1043366400,,1434,4.60546875

121918,4,0790736527,"It is very difficult to explain what happened during the 20th century with reference to the divine. This fact is brilliantly exploited in Al Pacino's monologue when he tries to convert Keanu Reeves (and the viewers?) to Satanism. ""The Devil's Advocate"" is a movie about a hyper-successful defense attorney who is being seduced by the promise of an even more complete and total professional success (not to mention physical and emotional ecstasy) by--who else?--the Devil.
Al Pacino is very convincing playing the Devil. I have to admit that even if one does not literally believe in either God or Devil, Pacino can make one think in this one. For example, the Devil made some persuasive points regarding the importance of vanity (his favorite sin)which, without giving away the ending, seems to be decisive and so damning in our lives; the nature of our (God-given) nature--our senses give us the ability to get physical satisfaction, but never completely (what we can experience through touch we often cannot taste, what we can smell we often cannot touch, etc; and the seeming futility of moral anguish and drama that we create in our lives.
The movie only gets four stars from me, because Keanu Reeves failed to convince me that his character had much of a soul to lose. He seemed to be soul-less before the Devil recruited him into his law firm. Reeves moves like a life-size doll at Disneyland. There is this rigidity and mechanical-like feel about him, and I was fearful that his character's mechanism would wind down and stop functioning before the Devil finished talking to him, leaving the picture incomplete and the viewers in suspense. Perhaps that is the effect the director and producers were going for?
This is a very good picture. I found it entertaining, disturbing, and thought-provoking. I am sure you will, too. For if you have gotten this far reading this review, you must be a bright, persevering, thoughtful person. You will find that this picture has a lot to offer: special effects, great acting, and an interesting story. (Vanity... definitely my favorite...)

It is Pacino's performance as John Milton (aka: Satan) that makes The Devil's Advocate worthwhile; with every other actor to portray Satan, they always portray him as a menacing, relentless sum of all evil.  Pacino gives Satan a classy swagger never before seen, making the devil seem more human than previously imagined.  The film itself is great, with Keanu Reeves' portrayal of Kevin Lomax, a hotshot lawyer who gets his chance to work in Pacino's lawfirm.  The beautiful Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen give good performances as well, especially Theron as Reeves' wife who senses something foul afoot, and eventually starts to lose her mind.  Jeffrey Jones and Craig T. Nelson give good performances as well, Nelson is rather good as a murder suspect who Reeves is picked to defend.  All in all, The Devil's Advocate is a great thriller, and Pacino is devilishly (no pun intended) charming as Satan.

The pacing is perfect, with no lulls in the action. The acting ranges from very good to outstanding.  It did take me a while to get used to Keanu Reeves' speaking with a Southern accent (which I think could have been avoided, since he was playing the role of a transplanted Floridian).  He does not seem to be nearly as involved in the character as he does in films such as ""The Matrix"", which one would think would have been a greater challenge to an actor.  His scenes with his wife became increasingly flat, but perhaps that was a deliberate decision in an effort to be consistent with the plot development.
Charlize Theron as Reeves' wife also seems to suffer a loss of involvement as the film progresses, but again, that may have been a calculated decision for reasons similar to Reeves' apparent detachment.
Al Pacino, on the other hand, gives a consistently excellent performance, and is one of the most convincing incarnations of Satan I've ever seen.  He clearly is having the time of his life, and that's exactly the element so often missing in such portrayals.
The visuals in this movie are beautifully done, whether it's a rooftop scene with the entire city spread below, or a dingy tenement basement lair of a voodoo priest.  There are also some excellent special effects, but they are not overdone.
Finally, a word about the ending (without giving it away).  I totally disagree with those who claim that it ruins the movie or makes it impossible to understand what really happened.  I found myself staring open-mouthed and then laughing out loud, not because it was a cheap joke, but because the director had managed to fool me not just once, but twice.

121931,2,0790736527,"""The Devils Advocate"" (1997)
I used to like The Devil's Advocate. I used to think it was everything a movie needed. Then I saw it again, and I can safely say I wasn't really that impressed. This movie is necessarily bad, but its not great either, its on the so-so level of filmmaking. But with a great cast, a neat idea and promising adverts, The Devil's Advocate should've been much more.
I'll start with the things that really got to me the second time round. One of those things was the acting in the film. Keanu Reeves is not my most favoured actor around today. Unfortunately with The Devil's Advocate, Keanu can just tick off another character he can't play - a lawyer. Reeves provided no suspense or fun with his performance, and he just really bugged me. Charlize Theron overacts horribly. At the start Theron is very good, but after she falls under the spell of the devil (Pacino), her character gets very mentally unstable and Theron goes over the top. Jeffrey Jones's character was just there to be another infamous cast member, but I thought his character was boring and I didn't find his performance as enjoyable or stylish as his other roles. Pacino is the only leading cast member who is able to find some juiciness to his character, and he is a greatly entertaining Satan. There is no comparison to his other performances, but he's pretty cool in this role.
The lead character is another problem with the film. You might be able to put this under the ""Keanu-Reeves-can't-act-category"", but Reeve's Lomax is a dumb leading man who always puts himself first and is a selfish and senseless idiot. I feel this problem may be more with the silly and recycled script than Reeve's acting, but the film suffered because of it.
The ending is probably the worst thing about the movie. Not only is it totally confusing and typical, but it takes the easy way out. The Devil's Advocate is not a movie that can challenge itself. It always has to finish sequences by taking the quick way instead of giving the audience something to think about.
All that said, there is always the stylish directing, some good visuals and special effect sequences, nicely done law scenes (which are strangled by Reeve's over-acting) and a few excellent and very modern editing. The movie looks and feels great. All this is unfortunately mustered and busted by the horrid character development, lots and lots of plot holes and the fact that the film actually has no message. Maybe its good to see how people react to temptation in some scenes, but I came out of the film still really confused about what the movie was actually about and why the hell all the stuff that happened in the film was really happening. So, my conclusion of The Devil's Advocate is this: a poor excuse to see lots of nudity and sex scenes. Miss this over-long bore, even if Connie Neilsen naked is a bonus.
MY GRADE: C",1018224000,3,2875,4.63921568627451
121932,5,0790736527,"I loved this movie.  Outstanding in practically every way.  Al Pacino's portrayal of Lucifer is exactly how I have always perceived the dark angel to be.  The devil does not have horns or a tail, he has the face of man himself. I am always amazed at how the religious zealots seem to conveniently forget that Lucifer was the highest angel, an archangel, thrown out of heaven because of his arrogance and rebelliousness, not because he was a mad demon.
Pacino plays this character beautifully - he is sly, charismatic, chilling, and seductive all at once. One of my favorite scenes was the elevator scene where Milton bates Kevin's mother by calling her ""Mrs. Lomax"" and asking her slyly that ""surely this wasn't her first trip to New York"".  Absolutely wicked! Then, as Milton casually wisks Kevin off to a night on the town at the Flamingo club and the boxing match (naturally Don King would have an alliance with Satan), I was mezmerized watching Milton weave his spell and reel Kevin smoothly into his web.  Pacino's climaxtic argument is brilliant as he exclaims that he's a fan of man and why.  As I watched Kevin's descent from Maryann,(Charlize Theron and Keanu had wonderful chemistry as a married couple),I was reminded of how we all make certain decisions then try to justify our actions later, usually with the precursor that, ""It wasn't MY fault, it was the work of Satan... then, like Kevin, we make the same decisions over and over.
I thought Keanu Reeves was perfect as the cool, arrogant, hotshot attorney who knows that he is so...good. I am completely baffled by all the haters panning Keanu's acting, he did a great job.  I thought the casting of all the actors were on point in this movie, everyone connected with each other and with their characters.
My only complaint is that the deleted scenes cannot not be viewed without the director's commentary.  The sub-titles can't even be displayed.  While this DVD has one of the best director's commentary's, it would be nice to have the option of watching the deleted scenes on their own since these scenes contribute to the continuity of the story and clear up questions a viewer may have.

I'm not going to expound on this film any more, because the eloquent reviewer from Woodstock, GA already did an excellent job of that.  However, I do want to point out that this film plays even better in my DVD player than it did when I watched it in the theater.  I don't know why, but I guess the sharper DVD image works for it better. Plus, the commentary by Taylor Hackford is extremely insightful. The film itself may go on a bit too long, and the climax still has me shaking my head a bit, but this film is undeniably provocative, giving us a better-than-average Keanu Reeves performance, who obviously has no trouble with a Southern accent (ditto for his British accent in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, another stylish and excellent film).  It also contains a performance by Al Pacino that is his best in years, and one that he clearly had a lot of fun in doing! But the performance that stands out the most for me is by relative newcomer Charlize Theron (originally from South Africa) as Reeves' suffering young wife.  Her performance is psychologically complex, sympathetic, and harrowing: she draws you into her character's heart so well that you can't look away. Her performance should have earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress; it's too bad that the Academy didn't agree.
Despite the way the plot of THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE may read to some viewers, it is not a horror film, per se. It is a very-well-realized, fantastical vision of the good and evil that underpins our money-driven, materialistic society.

Specifically, the option to experience the director's vision in its natural state without his commentary.

121937,5,0790736527,"This is a brilliant movie. While most people point out that it decries the negative aspects of greed, they miss the fact that the plot is really about work ethic.
Kianu's wooden performance as a small-town lawyer shows us a man who works hard but who's career hasn't taken off. A chance meeting with a recruiter takes him to New York City, where he strikes the fancy of the senior partner in a giant law firm.
He loses himself in the overwhelming opportunities that await him. His wife initially relishes in the fruits of his labor--a beautiful apartment, nice clothing, a busy social life--but soon starts regretting the loss of time she could spend with her husband and the lack of intimacy in her relationship. She retreats into herself and wallows; she doesn't try to find any new outlets, and all of her problems smoulder within her.
Charlize Theron, who plays that wife, is quite attractive. Her performance, mostly half the movie as a woman slipping into terror, dispair, and and dimentia, is very good. But Al Pacino, who plays the evil senior partner, steals the show. Each of his great movies features at least one long monologue of incredible power and control. This movie features three or four; he is a brilliant orator and an excellent actor. Because Kianu's character has little dynamic range, Kianu's weak acting doesn't sabotage the film.
The movie's inside out ending will leave many wanting. But I found it interesting and throughful.
Funny thing is, I didn't find this movie enjoyable. The plot line and the subject are troubling to me and that has me watching the movie with some amount of stress. It combines elements of drama and horror in very balanced portions. But as an experience, I found it quite disturbing--and I'm not normally that sensitive to such things. It's very entertaining, but it certainly isn't an escapist film.
The audio quality is below average for a DVD; the dialogue is moderated well, but the sound effects and ambient sounds are almost completely lost. The video quality is average. There's lots of poorly managed editing, and some terribly executed lighting, which the DVD production doesn't use to convey any ambience or tone. It just comes off as a mistake.

121938,5,0790736527,"That's how Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves)in a suitably cold as ice portrayal of a young ambititious lawyer, gets more than he plea bargained for.

In the MANY times I've watched this movie, I was totally riveted. Al Pacino does it again with another stellar performance as the modern day Lucifer of the Legal World, ironically named John Milton (""Paradise Lost"" author). His eerie chuckle while interviewing Kevin Lomax for a chance to legally bite the Big Apple, let's you know something is amiss. Of course, if you've seen the Exorcist, or know some folklore, the moment you realize that John Milton can fluently speak any language he needs at the moment, tips you off to who the ""Devil"" Mr. Milton actually is...(the devil supposedly speaks all languages).

I enjoyed Milton's phone conversations in Russian, a language I have a good working knowledge of. I also dug his sexually provocative Italian converstion with Connie Neilsen aka ""Kristabella"" whom John Milton has set up Kevin to lust after the moment he sees her. The part where Milton speaks mandarin to a street vendor in China Town...PLEASE! How many non-Asian people besides Mira Sorvino can master that tongue and not be suspect?

One of the best scenes for Milton's amazing language ability is when he's going to a championship boxing match on the train with Kevin and two latino wanna-be toughs are nearby. Milton can't help but stare one down, so one guy gets ready to ""get down in the trenches"", as Milton would put it, but the pulled knife freezes when Milton tells the guy that the minute he left his apartment, his wife went upstairs to his Buddy Carlos' house to split a ""Jumbo"" of crack, and get it on upon their green bedspread ""especial."" The whole thing sounded so melifluous said in Spanish, and so funny when you're reading the subtitles as he speaks!

Meanwhile, Kevins wife MaryAnne, played brilliantly by Charlize Theron, gave up her questionably successful real estate career to faithfully stand by Kevin. The price she pays for her unswerving loyalty, sanity AND vanity. She loses confidence in herself completely, letting Milton choose her hair style and color, and her snobby neighbor (Tamara Tunie, ""Eve's Bayou"") choose house paint color. She feels out of her league and inadequate ""swimming with the sharks"" as Milton puts it.

Especially surrealistic and nightmarish are the hallucinations that MaryAnne begins to have. We aren't told, but I assume Milton is entering her mind and playing evil tricks. There's a ghastly one where MaryAnne imagines a baby is playing with her reproductive organs. Subsequently, she finds out days later she's barren, also courtesy of Milton's magic I suppose. Then Kevin sees Kristabella before him in MaryAnnes place while making love. These images that Milton creates are very real and powerful. The image that really made me jump in my chair was when MaryAnne goes dress shopping with her neighbor and Eddie Barzou's (Firm Partner)wife. See for yourself if you flinch when you view the film............... Milton keeps this up through several more interesting turns, and finally he drives MaryAnne right where he planned to from the beginning. Milton then gets Kevin right where he wants him, until the ""free will"" he tells Kevin is his perogative, interferes with the outcome of Milton's ultimate plan.

Here's a film where the beginning, straight to a long amazing ending, (which leaves room for a part two)...will run you through a gamut of emotion, and leave you totally satisfied, yet wanting more, hence the ironic closing image that lets us know, some folks never learn.",1003017600,,3599,5.0

At the beginnig of the film he is defending a math teacher who presumably sexually assaulted one of his students. Kevin begins this case with a clear conscience, but discoveres the teacher is guilty at a crucial point in the trial - during the testimony of the girl herself. Kevin decides to defend the teacher nevertheless, and unmercifully attacks the young girl on the witness stand. He manages to create a reasonable doubt, based on several lies the girl told.
Following this case, he is invited to help a big firm in NYC choose a jury, and gloriously wins once again - against all odds. He is then invited to join this firm.
At first, this looks like a dream job. He gets an amazing salary, an amazingly large and beautiful new apartment... Kevin has all he needs to fit in, since he is being judged by his talent. But his wife, Mary Anne, finds herself over her head. Even though in her Gainesville life she is a confident woman, NYC proves too sophisticated for her - her tastes, her clothes, her hair - falls short of what her new friends have.
Mary Anne starts falling apart, while Kevin finds himself busy with his work and attracted to a female co worker. Slowly they drift apart from each other, until the dramatic finale...
Even though the ending is a little too much for me to accept, but the beginning could have made a pretty good film. But Keanu Reeves' even - more - wooden - than - the - usual acting, and the fact that Mary Anne's deterioration is seen in leaps and bounds instead of a gradual process ruin even that.
This DVD has a lot of other material, including commentaries, deleted scenes and a thorough explanation of who and what is the devil... This helped me raise the rating to 3 stars.",1002585600,2,1858,4.451612903225806

Because the over acting is perfectly done and the drama, though high, is right where it belongs. The direction and camera work are powerful and perfectly suited to the genre of the film. Al Pacino gives a stellar performance and carried an otherwise average cast to heights I don't think the writers dreamed of. Well cast, I can't think of anyone else who would have so convincingly and deliciously unconvincingly played the roles, and well executed, this movie is one of the greatest. Sacrilegious? Of course it is, it's a morality tale about the devil and his son, an attorney of all professions for a son of Satan to take! Laced with twists and turns, ups and down and the sensational ravings of Pacino's character, John Milton, there is not a dull moment throughout. Seriously, if viewer is prone to complain about the irreverent nature of this film, why are they considering buying or renting an R-Rated movie with profanity and nudity as features? So please don't wax theological on my review. If you're that serious about blasphemy, why are you reading this?

The story moves along fairly briskly, though the suspense seems a little light and the mystery isn't all that intriguing. Still, the pizza dispatches its share of technicians and redshirts and there are some funny lines uttered by Kirk, Spock, Scotty, and especially McCoy. These actors have, by this time, grown comfortable with their roles, and it shows in a very positive manner.

It is not for religious people, people easily offended by nudity, language, and/or gore, and people who really have it out for Keanu Reeves.  That being said, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is a modern epic which probes the nature of evil incisively. Of course, Keanu Reeves is not a great actor, but the role is written (much as the Matrix was written), to minimize his impact on the film and allow true actors and actresses, in this case Al Pacino and Charlize Theron to shine. The film details the descent into darkness of Kevin Lomax (Reeves), a small-town lawyer without much in the way of conscience, and not coincidentally an unblemished court record and his lively wife Mary Ann (Theron) after accepting John Milton (Pacino)'s offer to move to New York City and work for his law firm. Though both his wife and himself sense that all is not right in this alien world of power, sex, and money, Kevin is quickly absorbed by an obsession to win that separates him from his wife and sends them both on parallel tracks into evil. Always at Kevin's side is the suave, down-to earth Milton, who subtly prods him towards evil with a few words when needed. Though Reeves plays the central character, Pacino is certainly the most interesting and amusing of the cast. Just as the role of Lomax was written to fit Keanu Reeves, so the role of the ironically named John Milton (author of the classic Paradise Lost) was written to mesh nearly perfectly with Pacino. Theron shows her rather impressive acting ability in her role as the frustrated, frightened, and isolated wife, and the supporting cast doesn't trip up the film, which is pretty much all that can be asked of it. The film proceeds slowly but steadily through the first 2 hours, but the final half-hour that it builds to is truly awe-inspiring. The showdown between the infinitely calm and clever Pacino and the pissed-off, desperate, Reeves is a scene that really lets Pacino loose, and the twist at the end is a great surprise that few see coming and is more satisfying than other, more contrived endings. This film is not R-rated for the sake of being R-rated. Unlike other films, Devil's Advocate uses nudity, language, and violence to press its point. Without them, the film would take a serious hit in both plausibility and performance. Pacino's monologues are classics in themselves, namely the one prior to Eddie Barzou's death and the longer, more extravagant one at the climax. Reeves' emotions are semi-believable, and can we really expect more? Theron demonstrates why she deserves the leading roles she receives today. Finally, after the film your mind will be charged up and full of questions you can mull over for days, and its ability to create ideas and new concepts are what puts it head and shoulders above the ordinary class of films that entertain but do not make you think, at best.",989539200,10,2908,4.747035573122529

It gets better every time. Maybe Reeves isn't exactly a great actor but I think he did better than he'd done before this movie. It probably made him a better actor. And I'm honestly not being sarcastic. And as for Pacino- Every time I watch the final scene or two he makes me notice something different about his eyes or his words. This is by all means the perfect grounds for his talent. It's like they made a movie just for him. Nobody else could have played that part, it was a match made in... well wherever, it's a great match anyway. This is a movie to buy.

The story is simple enough; a young fireball of a lawyer, Kevin Lomax, played by Keanu Reeves, who has never lost a case, finds himself in the middle of every defense attorney's nightmare, representing a slimy sleazeball accused of molesting little girls. Halfway through the trial he realizes his client is guilty as hell, which presents him with a dilemma: he can extend his winning streak at the price of losing his soul; or he can do the right thing at the possible risk of torpedoing his career. What's a young, up and coming hotshot to do? In no time at all, he and his beautiful, fatally naive wife (excellently played by Charlize Theron) are off to New York, where he has been recruited to work for a high-powered law firm headed by a omnilingual, diabolically clever lawyer named John Milton (Al Pacino looks like he had the time of his life in this role) and staffed by a bunch of hell-bound associates. While Kevin's career takes off, his wife descends into a miasma of loneliness, despair and finally madness; and when Kevin berates Milton for driving his wife into her personal hell, Milton reminds Kevin that God, whom Milton fears as much as he hates, gave us all a left-handed gift called free will; we are free to make our own choices, and we have to live with the consequences. As the feller says, you can't win 'em all.  The film runs somewhat overlong but holds our interest throughout. There are many good performances in this movie and a few excellent ones, but when all is said and done, the film belongs to Al Pacino and his gleefully wicked portrayal of the devil incarnate.  Kevin is finally left to make his own choice, which I'm not going to give away here; suffice to say that the film's resolution is a shock.

121962,4,0790736527,"""The Devil's Advocate"" starts out good and gets better.  Brilliant defense attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) dodges the truth to  get his verdicts, and literally never loses a case.  He is seduced by a New  York firm headed by John Milton, as played by the wonderful Al Pacino.  While Lomax is off in the NYC courtrooms chasing his career, his wife Mary  Ann (played brilliantly by Charlize Theron) senses that all is not right  with Hubby's law firm, and begins to see the evil that lurks under Milton's  slick surface.
Even before being told at the end, we *know* that John  Milton is the Devil (it seems the only one who doesn't know is Kevin Lomax  himself), but certain strange clues point to this conclusion:
He speaks  fluent Cantonese.
There's a subway scene, when two Latino street punks  threaten to kill Lomax and Milton, but Milton starts speaking fluent  Spanish, telling one of the thugs that his wife is at the moment snorting  cocaine (or shooting heroin, I forget which) with a man she is about to  have sex with. (I'm not a Bible scholar, but I seem to remember hearing  somewhere that the Devil speaks every language on Earth.)
In the final  confrontation, Kevin goes to the office to face off with Milton.  The  Manhattan street is totally devoid of any life or movement, in what is a  truly memorable scene.
When Kevin's Bible-toting, Uber-Christian mother  comes to visit him in the city, she meets John Milton and is terrified of  the suave, charming man.
Pacino's monologue about a sadistic God is  excellent.  And although I have never liked Keanu Reeves in anything but  action movies, I respected, if not enjoyed, his performance.  The ending,  in which Lomax is destined to sleep with his sister (it's darkly hilarious  when Pacino says, with a raised eyebrow, ""She's ovulating!"") to  produce a child that will be the Antichrist, will all at once shock you,  relieve you, and make you angry.

121963,3,0790736527,"In life sudden wealth is often accompanied with a an emotional densensitisation, arrogance and ""forgetting the people that got you  there"". A braver film would have examined these issues on a more  intimate scale. The Devil's Advocate is an overought, occasionally riveting  and always entertaining film that has little time for subtlety.
  We are  introduced to Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), a brilliant Flordia lawyer who is  summoned by huge New York firm to help them pick the jury for a particular  case. He meets the head of the firm John Milton (Al Pacino), and in a  spectacular scene, standing next to a waterfall ontop of a skyscraper  Milton offers Lomax a job. ""Are we negotiating?"" asks Lomax.  ""Always"" replies Milton. As the film goes on, the wicked ways of  the firm take their toll on Lomax and his wife. The religious imagery has  become the norm for thrillers these days, and by naming the prince of  darkness after the 17th Century Puritan poet John Milton who wrote  ""And out of good still to find means of evil"", the film is given  that Exorcist like edge. The suggestion that evil hides behind an apparent  good, such as wealth for example.
  As Satan, Pacino has an obscenely  good time. Through the film's many visually arresting scenes  he is given  great lines like ""I'm the hand up Monalisa's skirt"". While Reeves  is essentially his straight man, I liked his naturalistic unforced  performance.
  The Devil's Advocate is too obvious to really get under  you skin, but its gothic often enthralling imagery is enough to reccomend  it, the most memorable being Lomax walking a completely deserted Manhatten  street with the skyscrapers towering beside him, a refrence I presume to  Pharoah's fateful journey in the Sainai Valley.",965001600,3,1753,4.9243986254295535

I  give the movie four stars, not five, because, even though it was a very  moral film, there were some situations that were repulsive, or something.
The plot of redemption is terrific.  The scene where Reeves is the only  one on the street is sweet.  The hands down best part of this film is the  ending.

Pacino's  monologue at the end is brilliant in it's conception and presentation.  The  truth about God, evil, death, Satan and the choices we all make are  presented here.

This movie gives us a knew view about Devil an Evil. And that is the reason why  this movie was so facinating for me. It shows that evil is everywhere  around us. The Devil doesn't live in hell, but on earth. He walks through  the streets, eats in restaurants, likes to go out, like all of us, but we  don't recongnize who he is.  My favorite part is at the end of the movie,  when the Devil (Al Pacino who plays exellent) shows who he really is. I  recommand this movie to everyone who likes strange movies.",961027200,,650,4.152

121968,4,0790736527,"I was sure this movie would be a complete waste of time.  Surprisingly, Taylor Hackford (he made the wonderful Officer & A Gentleman) delivers an old-fashioned, nail-biting suspense story, with just enough contemporary  flourishes to keep it taught and interesting.  While Keanu is  unintentionally funny with his Southern, halting accent, he is also somehow  sympathetic; you want him to do the right thing.  Charlize Theron is  heartbreakingly real in this movie; she earned her overnight star status  with a galvanizing and get-under-your-skin performance.  Al Pacino was for  me completely over the top; had his devil/lawyer been in line with the  other performances, which are anchored in reality, this movie would have  definitely earned five stars instead of 4 - the script is too generous with  him, and he overdoes virtually every moment of his screen time.  However,  the pop-spirituality of the plot, the sordid glimpses of a soulless life,  the slithering demons who appear out of nowhere, and the hip New York  locations do much to create a suspense and fear and interest not often seen  or felt in horror movies today.",958953600,5,1132,5.126373626373627

Anyone who said this movie frightened them is really a wimp.  It is a  satanic thriller which is one of the resons why i liked it.  After I saw  this movie I saw Seven and then read Dante's The Divine Comedy.  It really  brings out the dark side in all of us.  In the last scene i don't know why  he killed himself though, it works great with the movie but personally i  would have done her right there, beacause she is brutally hot.  Another  amazing feat was how they emptied out fifth avenue,(i know it was done in a  soundstage but it still looks cool) because there is never a time when you  can empty out a street like that ever. --Kenny 16 years old kegewex@aol.com",953424000,,894,4.182352941176471
121970,3,0790736527,"""The Devil's Advocate"" happens to be one of those dramatic films where nothing ordinary really happens, that is, if you are a lawyer who realizes that your new boss is Mr. Darkness himself.  That's where Keanu  Reeves steps in.  He portrays Kevin Lomax, a hot Florida attorney who's  never lost a case.  Then he receives a visitor from New York who talks to  him about how coming to the Big Apple to work for the mysterious firm  Milton, Chadwick, Waters can enrich his life as well as Mary Ann's life,  (Charlize Theron) too, by offering him a top salary and a first class  apartment right next to Milton's, which is real hellish, thanks to the  sculptures of nude bodies and the fireplace.  Turns out Mary Ann gradually  learns that John Milton, head founder of the firm, is the 'real-deal' Devil  and his women are demons and she finally loses her sanity.  Kevin's mother  (Judith Ivey) then comes in to inform him of the horrendous events that  have happened and certain info he needs to know.  Now, it's up to Kevin to  keep his soul from being incorporated by the firm and Milton himself.  Right around the movie, it become a horror flick that I probably would of  expected it to be, however, director Taylor Hackford, keeps it in a decent  pace, although the nudity and violence really doesn't help that much to the  film's plot.  One tip about the music by James Newton Howard: it really  puts me in suspense.  Warner Bros./Regency Enterprises.  Rated R  (Restricted.)",953337600,,1476,4.6640625
121971,4,0790736527,"One of the remarkable things about this film is that it features some quite long and rather philosophical monologues by Al Pacino that don't drag down the action at all -- this is as much an effect of the script and  direction as it is of Pacino's riveting hand-in-glove performance as Satan,  head of a powerful Manhattan law firm.  If you can look past his hokey  Southern accent, Keanu Reeves delivers one of his better performances as  well, playing the film's fatally flawed central character with considerable  finesse.
This film is as much about Manhattan as it is about moral  conflict, and features some stunning interior design.  One of the  revelations of the DVD edition is that the one really tastelessly decorated  apartment in the movie, an ostentatious gold-leaf and brass abomination, is  in fact Donald Trump's real-life penthouse.",952214400,3,849,5.0359712230215825

All the trappings of success and wealth are  here, tempting the protagonist until we actually find out that his boss is  literally from hell, he is old Lucifer himself. Nicholson got to play the  devil with much relishing affect in Withces of Eastwick, now it's Pacino's  turn. Pacino blazes across the screen you can almost see the fire in his  wake. There are only a few actors who can handle a role that demands such  an over the top performance without looking completly hammey and  ridiculous. Reeves surprises with a more insightful performance than ever  before and Charlize Theron (As Reeves's wife) mental breakdown before our  eyes is powerfully disturbing, proving that shes no flash in the pan.

121977,3,0790736527,"Surely everyone reads The Holy Bible.  Even I read it on occasion.  And a lot of doomsayers believe in the book of Revelations that Satan will have his turn on Earth.  But director Taylor Hackford has something else in  mind: a trying stake to create ""The Devil's Advocate"" where Keanu  Reeves, playing a winning attorney named Kevin Lomax, has a once in a  lifetime opportunity to move on up for a better life.  Way up.  He is wooed  by a very mystic law firm, headed and controlled by John Milton, played to  sadistic terms by Al Pacino, in which we know, except for Lomax that Milton  is actually the devil himself.  So now, Kevin and his wife Mary Ann  (Charlize Theron) then head to New York.  But as time passes on, Kevin is  encouraged by Milton to make his winning streak the best ever by quickly  taking on a triple-murder case, and for a minute turn his attention to a  wild sexy assistant Christabella (Connie Nielsen.)  On the other hand, Mary  Ann begins to, not envision, but actually see that Milton's wife and friend  are truly monstrous demons, then soon, she nervously exaggerates into a  nervous breakdown.  Kevin is horrifyingly upset and realizes from his Holy  Bible-quoting mom (Judith Ivey) that Milton is actually his father.  Talk  about turning heads!  Like I said, you ought to give credit to Pacino.  He  does have his 'thoughtful' moments to share, although discussing in his  terms what God really does got me a little burned up.  Also, nudity really  abounds from the females (both front and back) in this nightmare-filled  spree, so don't be surprised.  I can say that ""The Devil's  Advocate"" IS drama, yet later in the film becomes a horror movie.  One  hint though, ""Advocate"" has a double-twist toward's the end, but  the devil won't make me talk about it.  Warner Bros./Regency Enterprises,  Color by Technicolor.

In every scene with the Devil, it's made abundantly  clear in small, subtle ways, that to exist, evil must have collaboration.  Forcing people doesn't count. Evil requires an act of free will.

The cinematography is rich in gothic textures, painting  a dark and disturbing canvas. This is an interesting movie that also makes  one think. It's more intelligent than Andrew Niederman's novel.
