3101901,5,B00133KFIA,"Joyce Vedral has a strong Noo-Jork accent and her workouts are no-frills, but you have to understand that this lady has studied weight lifting and exercise for decades and she knows JUST what works and what works FAST.

If you (I mean you, Southerners and Westerners, especially) can put up with hearing the dulcet strains of a New Yorker, you will get a workout that includes supersets and pyramids that work the muscles to best advantage.

These workouts are short, and target just those two areas. Other DVD's by Joyce blend with these for customized workouts: for example, you can do this workout with the Bra-Roll-Boobs and butt on one day, and the thighs and and the butt workout on another workout day and then JUST ABS for a 6 day routine. The workouts are short (18-20 minutes) and you can customize your own workout and change it up this way, avoiding the boredom of the same tape every day. Or if you have a favorite mega-workout tape or go to a gym, you can do the arms to tone up on off-days to target those areas heavily.

Some usual criticisms of the Vedral DVD's are that she is not young (No, she is NOT. She's fit as hell, but she's over fifty. Oh well, we're all going to get old someday!) and the music is not heartpumpingly exciting. If you want a trendy, flashy workout, this isn't going to do it for you. But if you want to make the MOST of your time, using techniques with simple dumbbells and an a bench and a mat, with maximized effect, then this is it. The subtleties of using the right pyramids of weight and the right order of muscle exercises make these more effective than other workouts. Only a certified trainer, right by your side, could do better.",1280016000,9,1682,4.454545454545454

8249067,4,B00133KFIA,"I add this to the Cougar routine when able to.  I use the arms segment with the Cougar upper body and the thighs with the lower cougar workout.
The pace is pretty fast.  I do not like the drawn out introductory segment which wastes much time. Otherwise it is a good add on.",1440979200,,273,4.132075471698113

8249073,5,B00133KFIA,"My husband and I have been working out to this for almost a month and he has noticed a change in his posture toning and self esteem.  I have been working out with Joyce off and on for years and at 45 have been able to keep the middle age weight off and am still wearing a size three and intend to stay that size till they bury me.  I use other aerobic conditioning dvds but Joyces routines really take the cake. I just love her!  I love her accent and I love that she is 65!  There is way too much ageism in this world as we all get older and die and our lives would be so much more enjoyable if we exercised and ate right instead of stuffing ourselves literally to death and our only exercise is walking to the fridge!  I love accents and it is what makes this world interesting and alive and I really get a chuckle out of Joyce and her accent.  To hell with the naysayers and the ageists.  My husband has seen shocking results since starting to work out with me and he wishes he had started years ago when I tried to get him to try weight training.  Joyces workouts are not girly and this is what surprised my husband as he was really struggling through the workouts.  I recommend Joyce and her workouts to anyone, fat or thin, young or old.",1322524800,6,1243,4.103305785123967
8249074,4,B00133KFIA,"Joyce is such a hoot, she makes working out fun.  I wasn't sure I would like to the pyramid approach but love it.  It is flexible and any size of weights can be used.  Adjustments to Increase weight can be made easily to continue receiving a challenging workout.  I have purchased several of her DVD's to vary my workouts.",1314403200,3,322,4.406779661016949
