8333887,5,B001PMTAVM,Delivered quickly and as advertised. A great film of a great opera.,1487808000,,67,4.666666666666667
8333888,4,B001PMTAVM,"Hungarian opera is more robust than Italian and less harsh than German.  See also the 2005 cinematic opera ""Johanna"", also Hungarian.  This is a refreshing sound, a whole new color pallet versus mainstream opera in German or Italian, though Erkel did have an Italian 'bel canto' influence as his foundation, not a Wagnerian.  That alone prevents Bank Ban from being merely ""Wagner Lite"", which it approaches in its grim tone.  The story telling and music are lesser to a modest degree in Erkel, but it is worth it to hear a fresh operatic language and timbre.",1419379200,,559,4.791666666666667
8333889,4,B001PMTAVM,"I had not heard of this Hungarian composer.  Tho this opera was written in 1861 it sounds late romantic.  It moves along quite well except for Melinda's mad scene.........  Mostly, the tension is maintained very well and the fit of words and music to the emotions is about as good as it gets.  The cinematic quality is a wonderful fit to the story.  I don't think anything was a set, but actual places.  The lighting from the many little fires and candles added to the marvelous atmosphere.  Quite amazing how the cinematic qualities fit so well.  Rare in opera movies.

The male voices were all first rate.  But the 2 ladies had some irritating qualities.  Wobbly Marton and rattlily Rost.  Hence only 4 stars",1391731200,2,710,4.637096774193548
