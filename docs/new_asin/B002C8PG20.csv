3905312,4,B002C8PG20,Ny husband is ahunter and has hunted in Alaska a few times and he likes this DVD.  It was a gift and he has showen it to friends while they were over.,1330214400,,150,3.6875
3905313,4,B002C8PG20,"...the one on oil is purely political.  The others are pretty good.  I bought it mainly for the one about homesteaders.  The bear Island one is pretty amazing, but again a little NatGeo political.",1325894400,2,196,4.705882352941177
3905314,1,B002C8PG20,"This is a VERY OLD series of shows that were done by National Geographic.  The shows were broadcast several decades ago, around the mid 1980s, on PBS cable television.  I watched them back then and remember them well.  I thought from the packaging this was something NEW.  Big mistake, so please don't make the same mistake.

If I had known the DVDs consisted of OLD (re-packaged) National Geographic stuff I wouldn't have bought it ($15).  The company is extremely careful in their advertising & packaging to NEVER mention the creator was National Geographic.  The DVD introductions DO make the connection (but that is too late).

Don't get hoodwinked by this company, they deceive people by portraying DVDs as something they are NOT.  Spend your money on something else.  Research all offerings and then call the company to determine if you can get your money back ...before you buy.  I expected better from Amazon, but THIS ONE IS A PURE & SIMPLE RIP OFF!  It deserves a minus 1,000 rating.",1323216000,10,993,4.810650887573964
3905315,5,B002C8PG20,"We really enjoyed the videos in this set.  As I own property on the Kenai pennisula, I am constantly striving to learn more about Alaska, and living in all parts of Alaska.  This is well worth the time and money!",1323216000,10,212,4.275
3905316,5,B002C8PG20,this man lived alone in the Alaskan wilderness for 30 years! All the videos on his life (Bob Swerer productions)are really great ....,1312243200,3,133,4.826086956521739
3905317,5,B002C8PG20,"I watched this video series with my parents and loved it so much I got it for a friend who was going to Alaska. His mom broke into it and watched it twice before he arrived home. My parents have been to Alaska three times and my friend has never been--but both our families found this really entertaining. My aunt is also looking for her own copy after having watched ours. If you've ever envisioned living on the fruits of your own labor, Braving Alaska will totally blow your mind. Giant Bears of Kodiak Island has fabulous footage of cute bears--what more could you ask for?",1310515200,15,577,4.452830188679245
3905318,2,B002C8PG20,"These four DVDs cover Bears and living in Alaska and how the oil companies are destroying Alaska, and it was not what I expected. But you might enjoy them, it depends on what you are looking for.",1305763200,4,195,4.297297297297297
3905319,3,B002C8PG20,it is ok.  not what I thought it would be.  but still a nice addition to my video collection.,1439596800,,93,3.8421052631578947
3905320,2,B002C8PG20,The first disc was a good story about a family that lived in Alaska back in the day And lived off the land they had several children and enjoyed pioneer life. The other discs were about grizzly bears and one disc would have been enough on grizzly bears. I feel jipped on the whole package.,1427760000,,289,4.2727272727272725
3905321,5,B002C8PG20,GREAT VIDEOS ON WILDERNES LIFE AND SURVIVAL IN ALASKA,1425340800,,53,5.0
3905322,5,B002C8PG20,Another great dvd of Dick Proenneke.,1424822400,,36,5.166666666666667
3905323,3,B002C8PG20,"We ordered this video for the fact that it was about living in total self sufficiency, This was not the case. Of the four discs only one really covered what we thought was the content. The first disc covered several families living totally off the grid, which we were led to believe was the topic of the whole set. One was about the oil industry and ANWR, one was about Bear Island, and the last one  about the Alaskan Brown Bears on Kodiac Island. You look at the cover what do you see, a rustic cabin. I believe this is a good case of mis-direction.",1423612800,8,551,4.247619047619048

3905328,4,B002C8PG20,Really enjoyed this set with few exceptions.  However it is much the same as the Alaska: The Last Frontier video I received later.,1389398400,4,130,4.6521739130434785
3905329,5,B002C8PG20,Love this .My husband love out door stuff. alone in the wilderness is his favorite movie we bought from here. thank you .,1387324800,,121,4.304347826086956
3905330,2,B002C8PG20,"Geez, I really hate to leave a bad product review here, but in this case I really do feel it's necessary. Why? To alert others so they don't waste their money too buying something that sounds new or different, etc. but is actually really just a recycled 20 year old series with a whole new name. This 4 disc set is a National Geographic knock off. Unfortunately, no where on the packaging or in the selling description does it tell you so. These are the exact same videos that National Geographic put out on 4 different VHS tapes some 20 plus years ago. I had already watched these and currently have them in my collection. If the product description or packaging would just have been straight forward and honest saying these were a National Geographic consolidation it would have saved me from purchasing something I already had/seen. If you haven't seen the originals then these of course are great. If you have then you too will be very disappointed.",1370044800,28,953,4.644970414201183
3905331,4,B002C8PG20,we really enjoyed this series. It is amazing what people can survive and continue to push thru when elements are against you,1361232000,,124,4.681818181818182
3905332,4,B002C8PG20,"If you are a  fan of Alaska, this is a good DVD set. Wasn't interested in the oil industry part, but the rest was very good. What can you say, its National Geographic.",1361059200,2,167,4.0606060606060606
3905333,5,B002C8PG20,"Thoroughly injoyed this DVD about Alaska & how many people have chosen to rough it out in the last frontier.
Beautiful ........anything about Alaska & her landscapes.",1358294400,,166,5.185185185185185
3905334,5,B002C8PG20,"Loved the adventure of this author!  Even though he appeared to take advantage of all the help he received in Alaska, he did manage to come through it alive and very lucky, thanks to them!  One has to wonder about the man's wisdom of the timing and manner of his venture!  Fun to read though!",1358208000,,292,4.2727272727272725
3905335,5,B002C8PG20,I enjoyed viewing the life of homesteaders (not easy). Other viewings shared what's going in Alaska and environment. An older edition--still good info.,1357516800,,151,5.608695652173913
3905336,1,B002C8PG20,"This was false advertising.  They advertised the dvd as a story about 4 families living in the Alaskan wilderness but that was only the first dvd.  The other 3 dvds where horrible and they had an environmentalist agenda, which they did not advertise of course.  I would not waste money on these dvds.  The first one was ok but the rest are garbage.",1352937600,6,348,4.476190476190476
3905337,4,B002C8PG20,"I do want to go to Alaska and am doing all I can to find out what to look for and what to do.
This is just one of the books and movies that I am dealing with.
This book must have been the second in a series,he had already been there the summer before and knew a lot about
what to do and had things there already.

Good read for me,and some others may like it too.",1347408000,,363,3.6538461538461537
3905338,4,B002C8PG20,"This is a National Geography documentary which was released in 1993 but now out in DVD. My interest was the first DVD, BRAVING ALASKA where people live away from civilization and the closest neighbour is some 50 miles away. Good quality and very educational as I expected.
