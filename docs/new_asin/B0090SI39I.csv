5212438,4,B0090SI39I,"We just saw this in the theatre opening weekend. The first cloudy movie was a big hit with us- one of my kids favorites. They were super excited to see Cloudy 2. Going in, I thought, there's no way the sequel is going to be awesome, as most sequels go. But it turns out, it was really well done. Hilarious movie and animation. Colorful, creative, and fun world. The only things I was not particularly fond of was the ape scientist, the gross part with the animal birth, and they went a little overkill on the puns and cheesy jokes. The stew joke for example. But there was a lot of great humor as well. i.e. ""Get back in there tear!"" or the Berry translating Flint.

Spoiler: Also, something I felt was overlooked but not a big deal... They were making the one scientist out to be a bad guy, because he wanted to destroy the food animals, and make them, well, food. lol. But meanwhile, real animals, sardines, were being killed and eaten by the good guys. I don't care... Just sayin'. All in all a great movie, especially for a sequel. One that ALL ages can enjoy, even my toddler was giggling. If you were a fan of the first Meatballs movie, you'll most likely enjoy the sequel.",1380326400,5,1179,4.359090909090909
5212439,5,B0090SI39I,"""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2"" is a heartening and animated movie about an inventor who must figure out a way to deal with food creations that somehow morphed into ""foodanimals.""  This inventor is accompanied by his friends and must carefully choose between either listening to them or another scientist that he truly admires.  ""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2"" is perfect for many people who  like gleeful family friendly films.",1380326400,5,440,5.0
5212440,5,B0090SI39I,"After viewing Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, we all anticipated the arrival of this hilarious movie. As in the first showing, the animation is fantastic, and there is laugh-out-loud moments, presenting a delightful comedy for the family. Flint thought he saved the world, when he destroyed his machine that turned water into food, as we watched cheeseburger rain, and spaghetti tornadoes. However, his invention survived, and is now creating food-animals. Flint and his friends, embark on a dangerous mission to battle foodimals, to once again save the world. The colorful characters come to life, and the intriguing story has your attention from start to finish. Adults enjoyed it as much as the children, and the sound effects are awesome. Since I saw so many children enjoy this movie as much as they did, I will be gifting the DVD to friends and family for the holidays. The animation is breath-taking, and many families would find this fun-filled, for quality-time entertainment. There is plenty of action and fantasy in this funny adventure. The laughter heard in the background, with the joyous smiles on so many faces, make this movie a golden gem not only for children, but for adults who love animation. Entertaining, very funny, and highly recommended!",1380240000,58,1267,5.096153846153846

This is one of the movies where the sequel is as good as the original, and in some ways better.

I love the fact that the characters continue to grow and you are introduced to new characters as well as new ideas for characters.

I am sad that Mr. T did not reprise his role, but everyone else seems to have and I like that.  Consistency in characters is good.

Highly recommended as a movie.  Now I just need to actually get a copy to own.",1473292800,2,555,3.9909090909090907

With that said, it is refreshing to see well rounded characters in family animated films.

This movie has a much less intriguing and originol plot than the first, though I thought the visuals and humor were really fun to watch. I will always prefer the first Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, but there is no denying the visual splendor and entertainment value of its sequel.

I wish there were more family movies like this and the likes of The Incredibles, just to name another great animated feature. In an industry full of re-boots, remakes and superheroes--which I do love, it's always exciting to watch something totally strange and new.",1472774400,4,859,4.836734693877551

He might like this one better than the first one. If your kid likes the first one, they will like the second. Also, if you haven't seen the first, you won't feel like you need to see it before enjoying this movie.

Parents guide tip: This uses words like 'loser' and 'idiot.' Probably best for ages 5 or 6 and older. There was one scene with a food monster that my 8 year old finds too intense. If your child gets scared easily, you may want to not allow them to watch this. Overall, its interesting and fast paced. A unique movie with lots of cute and creative food creatures.",1465516800,,746,4.216783216783217

She had learned all the names of various fruits, vegetables, and animals from watching this. She also dances and sings along to the songs.  It's one of the few shows that can capture her attention long enough to let me do some chores around the house or cook a quick dinner.  At first it was available on Netflix for streaming.  When it was removed from the streaming library, I had to come to Amazon to buy a digital copy. Now we can put it on whenever and wherever we need it.

However the flmsfsfr machine doesnt fully shut down properly and the government says everyone in swallow falls must leave their homes while the government cleans up their town to prevent further injury. But the government has other plans to use Flint Lockwood to search the now food infested jungle of Swallow falls to steal his invention the flmsfsfr machine. Before they had to deal with genetically mutated enlarged food. Now they are dealing with mutant living food. Do they eat or be eaten by the food to save Swallow falls? Again Flint needs to use a more powerful kill code to destroy the flmsfsfr machine. Or does he want to alow the mutant man eating food to live all the time? Find out when you order this great movie. Cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2.

After forty-one minutes of goofy characters doing stupid stuff and us not laughing once, my entire family decided to bail and stop watching.  The greatest movie fail in memory.  At least I'm only out three bucks.

At least I learned that there is a vast population of humans out there that see humor where neither my wife, myself, nor my adolescent boy, nor my teenage boy see anything to laugh at.

5213579,3,B0090SI39I,"I had written off the original film as being mindless entertainment for kids, but when I saw it, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed it.  So when I heard plans for Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, I knew I had to see it.  Fortunately, I waited until it was out on DVD because it wasn't nearly as good as I expected.

This movie picks up immediately after the last film ended.  The Live Corp Company has been hired to clean up the food left behind by Flint Lockwood's (voiced by Bill Hader) invention.  Live Corp was founded and is still run by Chester V (Will Forte), Flint's inventing idol, so when Chester offers Flint a job while the island is cleaned, he jumps at the chance.

However, cleaning up the island doesn't go as planned.  In fact, the machine has survived and is creating something new - mutant food/animal hybrids.  There's only one way to stop it, reprogram the machine.  And so Flint finds himself returning to the island with his girlfriend Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), his father Tim (James Caan), and several other friends from the first movie.  Will they be able to stop the machine?

The first movie was predictable, but it had creativity and charm going for it.  I actually laughed quite a bit at the clever things they did with the premise.  It wasn't great art, but it was entertaining.

This movie?  It is still fairly predictable.  And the food/animal mashups were actually pretty clever.  However, it just falls flat.  I think that was for two reasons.

First, we spend too much time away from the island and the food.  Once we get back there, it feels forced.  Yes, some of that was set up, but it slowed the pacing of the film down over all.

Second, it has a been there and done that feel to it.  Yes, we are doing with food/animals instead of food falling from the sky.  Still, how we had to stop it wasn't that original.  Flint and his father are still having the same issues.  And it always feels like a cheat to me when they have to start a movie by invalidating the climax of the original.  Even Steve the monkey, who stole the show in the first film, isn't nearly as funny here.

Now this isn't to take anything away from the voice cast, who are still great.  The animation, likewise, is fun and feels perfect for this cartoony film.

The humor is something kids will appreciate.  I can see them, the target audience, still getting a kick out of it.  However, some of the creatures might scare kids when they first appear, so parents will want to be aware of that.

Kids will probably still be entertained by Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, but their parents will only be able to tolerate it.  That's a shame since the first one was so much fun.",1434585600,,2695,4.388663967611336

5214807,4,B0090SI39I,"I didn't get a chance to see the first film in this series (I'm assuming more will come) but I did know enough to know what it was about. So walking into this one didn't leave me wondering for the first 20 minutes what was going on. It also helped that they sort of give you an idea from the start as well.

The folks of Swallow Falls have been relocated while a clean up of their food filled city is underway. Hero/inventor Flint Lockwood, the man who created the machine that turned items into food, now works at The Live Corp Company, owned and operated by his hero, Chester V, and responsible for the town's cleanup. There he will work alongside some of he greatest minds in the world creating all sorts of wonderful things. Or so he thinks.

One of Flint's first assignments is to return home to not only clean up the problem there but to find his original invention. It seems that it not only has created food from the skies but has also begun turning food into living beings. Not the hamburgers from cows sort but living breathing combinations of food stuffs into new creatures. In so doing Chester V also puts a wedge between Flint and his friends, something we know will eventually be corrected and at which point our unknowing hero will realize was a mistake as he uses them to help save the world. Yes it seems that Chester V actually has evil plans in store for Flint's invention and Flint and the gang must unite to put a stop to said plans.

Really the movie boils down to a simple story and that actually works in its favor. Rather than overcomplicate things it makes the movie easy for both kids and inattentive parents to follow. The real treat here is the visual imagery that is on display. The animation is fantastic (even though I'm not a huge CGI animation fan) and the colors on display make you ooo and aahh about once per minute. The combining of food into animals is amazingly inventive and works well within the guidelines of the story.

But the true test of how good a kid's film is lies in its ability to not only take us somewhere we've never been before but to make us want to visit it again and again. For myself I found the world presented here one that I'd love to see over and over again. Keeping it fresh will be the hardest part. Keeping it a feast for the eyes the easiest. In the end both kids and adults will find this one a movie worth adding to the collection.",1403654400,,2401,4.328888888888889

The food creatures show amazing levels of creativity and inventiveness.  Definitely a reason to share this video with kids and encourage fertile imaginations.  The lesson on friendship is a bit overwrought but I've seen worse.  The characters here are all imperfect comical stereotypes with both flaws and strengths.

5215535,5,B0090SI39I,"Well, after watching this it's obvious all the movie funding went into the 2nd video and not the first. :-) Not sure why but the 2nd movie was so much better than the first. Maybe it's because I had a higher expectation for the first, since we all read the book when we were younger. Or, perhaps it's because I had no expectation after seeing the 1st and dreading having to watch the 2nd, lol.

The movie was great, and my kid LOVED it. Best part is, I could watch it too- and that's not so common when it comes to some of the movies people put out now. Like a lack of thought and morality floating around...",1396915200,,608,4.1525423728813555

The second movie had the most of the same characters and animation but the storyline was lacking. Despite the reference to ""Jurrasic Park"" the story seemed to be long and contrived, although some of the dialogue was cute. I also thought the Professor and his ape assistant were somewhat thin as characters.",1396915200,,390,5.109375

And it's hard to say no to him, so we gave watched it over and over and over. Honestly, it only gets better, as I've noticed extra cute jokes and little details. About the importance if friendship, being loyal to others and true to yourself.",1396828800,,416,4.56

I'm a 50+ year old guy for pity's sake, there's no way I should enjoy a kids movie so much. As good as the first, if not better in some parts. The Steve Jobs takeoff character is hilariously evil, and the supporting characters are simply great.

If they make a third one this good it won't be LOTR, but would be far better in keeping a bunch kids out of trouble on a rainy Sunday afternoon.",1396224000,,430,4.047058823529412

5216306,4,B0090SI39I,"Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2 is a great movie to watch with the kids.  Although walking talking food was very creepy to me, it didn't seem to have the same effect on our three year old!  All I kept thinking was, instead of running from the Taco Supreme, just eat it - but then it had babies... yuck!  It just ruined my appetite.  The CG in this movie is top notch.  The storyline... well, it's created to entertain young'uns so it doesn't have to make any sense (and it doesn't).  It attempted to teach the value of friendship and belief in self (the belief in self lesson is so low key, that I'm sure most people who would watch this movie more than once would completely miss it; that's because those people probably wouldn't be older than say 9 years old).

Yes, I recommend this movie to watch with your children.  If you're an adult and you're watching it without kids... well, let's just say you have some growing up to do.  LOL.  My last comment, if you're on a diet this is also a great movie (because you'll lose any craving for sustenance.  Who wants to eat anything that is in love with you and has puppy-dog eyes??!)",1395792000,,1135,4.331753554502369

5216682,3,B0090SI39I,"I think that many people will agree with me when I say that the previous CWACOM film was just a really great film. Pretty much everything about it was great: the great characters, wacky humor that was clean but funny, the pretty vivid colors, and, of course, all the food. That's defiantly a film that is stapled in my animated film collection. And around the time that this film was first released, I heard allot of positive feedback from viewers that said that it lived up fully to the previous CWACOM, probably even better than it's preceeder for some. When it became available for rent on Blu-Ray, I decided to see what it was like myself. I had the chance to watch it twice before I returned it, so I remember the plot details pretty well.

Meh, it was alright.

I have to say that I was just slightly disappointed with it: I was hoping for something that was faithful to the feel of the original film. But that film feel that helped make the first CWACOM so popular has been replaced with a rather big bash of Hollywood cheese. In other words, it seems like it's one of those films that was made for money. But that doesn't mean that it was a complete loss. Not at all. But the plot and characters are, at times, rather problemic. I can have a long list of problems with this film. I mean, a LONG list. But, for the sake of keeping this review, I'll only go through the film's top three biggest problems. As follows:

1. Barb, that monkey...er, ape, really doesn't belong in this film. She's just plain-out freaky. Well, maybe not freaky, but she is very....weird. I mean, all the characters in CWACOM are weird, but in a funny way: but Barb isn't funny at all. She's just awkwardly weird. She really doesn't really do that much in the film, but she appears ALLOT. And most of the time, she is really annoying. And that whole thing about Chester V calling her a monkey and not caring for her much...Eh, that was pointless. I just think that Barb was created for film franchise.

2. I really don't like how they introduced all that really advanced technology to the world of CWACOM. In the last film, there was a nice, rustic feeling about everything that made Flint's FLDSMDFR feel like a really cool device. But all that is lost here: now we have realistic holograms, walls that people can walk through, robot suites and just plain from-the-future technology. Nothing about Flint's inventions or any machine of any kind for that matter seem so important anymore. While the previous film seem to give an albeit strange but cool glimpse into the future, this film feels (too much) like the future. This sort of spoiled the movie some for me.

3. Allot of the original characters really feel out of touch here. I'm talking about the principal cast in General: Chicken Brent (previously Baby Brent), Earl the policemen, Manny (the camera man), and even to an extent, Sam Sparks. Brent, Earl and Manny feel allot more like secondary characters than they did in the previous film: through the course of the whole movie, they do practically nothing of use and don't have really in-depth dialogue and situations to make them connectable: Chicken Brent seems to be even more of a burden than he was in the previous part (and he is rather annoying for most of the movie), Earl just jumps around and never actually dos much, and Manny....does virtually nothing at all. While in the previous film, they all had a big role to play. Well, maybe not Baby Brent (as he was called at the time), but even he had more to do in that film than this one. All of them just seem to ""be there"" and they have little to do with the story. Sam Sparks had a pretty big role, but same with her: she never really did anything of real importants. She does ALLOT more than some of the characters mentioned before did, but nothing she did really had an effect on the outcome of the film. [SPOILER ALERT] Even in the end, when she was helping the veggie/fruit/plant animals escape from Chester V's base, she couldn't have done it without a LOT of help from Flint, and just to get herself captured again. The only real good guy characters that do anything of importants is Flint and his dad (Tim Lockwood). I actually like how they seemingly enlarged his role from the previous film: he really does allot here, and all he does really flows with the plot, But when he and Flint are the only good guys of real importance to the story, well, that's a problem. I just wish that they could have at least make some of the characters of more importance in the film. Really a weak spot.

As I said, I could name allot of problems with this film, but these ones really take the cake. It just feels like the makers expected this film to be successful because the previous one was, and in that they became a little carless in writing and creating it, really bringing down the quality that was so well captured in the previous film.
But as I said before, that doesn't mean that it's a poor film not worth watching: why else would I give it three stars? The colors and food (feel weird saying that) here are really vivid and gorgeous, defiantly outdoing that of the first CWACOM. And they look simply stunning in Blu-Ray. MOST of the newly introduced characters are really great and fit right in (like Chester V), the action is witty and exiting, and, of coarse, there is plenty of delicious food. It's not that this is a bad movie: it's just that it could have been better. Probably not a movie that I'd buy, but something that I'd watch and perhaps enjoy. I know that allot of people may like it better than I do. But I still hope that is review was still somewhat helpful to you. :)",1395100800,2,5643,4.463178294573644

Some of the jokes are a little more crass than the original movie, so I might say it's just the slightest bit less wholesome than the original but otherwise it's terrific and still highly recommended. We're not talking about any major issues here, and I only highlight it as a super picky parent. But if you liked the first, you'll definitely like the sequel.",1394064000,,477,4.494252873563219

My 6-year old son and I both found this one equally, if not even better, than the original. Both movies harken back to the book we all read as children, so it makes a great movie for adults and children alike. Watch this one, it's a sequel well done and thoroughly entertaining.

After dinner we banished the four and five year old to the T.V. room to watch this movie.  After about 1/2 hour of utter silence I went in to check on them.  Now we're talking about two active, squirmy kids who couldn't sit still for a minute if their life depended on it.  As I poked my head in I witnessed two children staring transfixed by the screen in what appeared to be an hypnotic stupor.  I wasn't sure whether I should be frightened or grateful that they were electronically anesthetized to the point of near somnolence.  My fears were soon allayed when the movie ended and the two came bounding out of the room re-energized and ready to rumble.",1393718400,,821,4.397350993377484

So, when it came out on DVD and my youngest wanted it, I had no problem buying it, as I knew it would get plenty of views. He's watched it 3 times, we've all watched it together once and his 8 year old brother is bringing it to school for the class to see on Friday. What can I say? This is one sequel that worked.",1393113600,,474,3.797979797979798
5217653,1,B0090SI39I,Story lacked continuity . . Generally just a collection of spastic antics stitched together by nonsense. Can't get that time back. Sad.,1393113600,3,135,5.181818181818182
5217654,5,B0090SI39I,The movie is really funny.  Kids laughed  hysterically and are still quoting the movie.  I truly enjoyed it as well,1393113600,,115,4.65
5217655,5,B0090SI39I,"The first Cloudy movie came out of nowhere and really surprised me. It was well drawn, the voice acting was great, and it was legit funny.  So I had worries about the sequel, if it could live up to the original. The good news is, is that it does. There are just as many good laughs in this film as in the first one.  If you have kids sit down and watch it with them and have a good time. The Blu Ray is absolutely gorgeous. It is demo worthy for your TV or sound system. The colors look rich and vibrant like we all have come to expect from Blu Ray. The Blu Ray version also comes with 3 mini movies which are good for a quick laugh. Overall I highly recommend both this and the original film. Hopefully they will complete the trilogy because I would love to see more adventures with this cast of characters.",1393027200,,808,4.1075949367088604

5217691,4,B0090SI39I,"We all enjoyed this movie, but only enough as a rental, not enough there to watch multiple times.  Still for Friday night movie night it was fun.  My kids liked it better than the first one because the food animals were interesting.  Overall good fun brainless film,",1392940800,,266,4.617021276595745
5217692,4,B0090SI39I,"My kids love the movie, however, the streaming was not the best, it keeps stoping, skiping, junping forward and at one point stoping and not doing anything. I probably won't rent videos this way again.",1392940800,,201,4.771428571428571
5217693,2,B0090SI39I,I thought the ads for this show was funny but after watching the movie I thought it was a typical sequel that could not really hold your attention.,1392940800,,147,4.285714285714286
5217694,4,B0090SI39I,"Having first watched the trailer to this movie, I wasn't sure what to think at first.  Luckily, unlike some films, this one didn't give all the good gags and scenes.  Watching with my lovely wife; I watched a fun, quirky, cute and fast paced animated movie.  Being both kids at heart, this film kept us going until the very end.  Fantastic fun for kids of all ages and cannot recommend this one enough.  Now that that is done, I'm off to ride the Watermelophants!",1392854400,,463,4.464285714285714

5217932,5,B0090SI39I,"My 3 year old daughter just loved this flick. She has asked for a white lab coat, requested her father build her a lab in a tree, and told me she wants to invent things. She spent the day after watching this building  ""a machine"" from shoe boxes and tin foil (with help). The point I'm getting at is this film not only entertained her but inspired her imagination too, which is what I'd like from every thing she watches (fat chance). The animation is wonderful, we get to know the characters from the first film in more detail, and the plot is quirky and fun, with some wonderfully clever ideas and a great villain. This is a firm favorite and fun for the whole family.",1392681600,,670,4.317460317460317
5217933,5,B0090SI39I,"This was a good sequel to the first movie.  It is, however, a cautionary tale how we need to be careful of who our idols are.  The strawberry is pretty darn cute, too, and almost steals the show.",1392681600,2,195,4.105263157894737

5217936,5,B0090SI39I,Great entertainment for kids age 5 and up. I thought it was better than the first one - all the same fun visuals but a less scary storyline with a warm (but not mushy) ending. I wish all kids movies were this worry-free. It's amazing how many kids movies hinge the plot on something totally traumatic like the death of a parent or separation from your family.,1392595200,,359,4.373134328358209

5218354,4,B0090SI39I,"In a sea of animated movies to come out this year, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" actually looked like a fun time to me. I had been a fan of the first film, which received a Golden Globe nomination in 2010, and I went in expecting a light-hearted comedy. Fortunately, that's exactly what I got.

The new movie returns after the disastrous food storm in the first film, and Flint accepts the invitation to join The Live Corp Company. This company has been assigned to clean the island, and it's where the best inventors in the world create technologies for the betterment of mankind. When Flint discovers that his machine still operates and now creates mutant food beasts, he and his friends must return to save the world. Though this movie won't win any Oscars any time soon, it turned out to be an enjoyable family-comedy.

With beautiful animation from Sony Pictures, and a fantastic voice cast, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" would be a smart rental for you and the kids.",1392163200,,988,4.607954545454546

5218664,4,B0090SI39I,"On the whole childrens books make for some excellent source material for computer generated features.  And why wouldnt they? Theyre typically cute stories for viewers of all ages rife with bright artwork and laced with some sort of life-lesson for good measure.  And such was the reasoning behind Sony Pictures Animations 2009 big screen adaptation of the 1978 childrens book Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  While the source material was pretty simplistic, Sony managed to scrape quite a memorable and charming tale of what was there.  Perhaps due to a wonderful voice ensemble, layers of humor that appealed to kids and adults alike, unique visuals or some combination of the three- the original Cloudy sort of came out of nowhere and managed to dazzle just about all who encountered it thus explaining how it turned its $100-million budget into $243-mil (gross) worldwide.

As is expected in Hollywood, no money-making stone remains unturned and a sequel was all but inevitable and 4-years after the original film, we got Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, which, interestingly opted not to acknowledge the literary sequel (Pickles to Pittsburgh) and instead continue on with the plot, characters and settings established in the first film.

The film actually opens with a brief recap of events taking place in the first movie, mainly that Flint Lockwood's (Bill Hader) FLDSMDFR (Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator) was blown up at the conclusion of the first adventure but apparently wasn't destroyed in the process.  Buried in mountains of uneaten and mostly gigantic food; the citizens if Swallow Falls, though relieved to be alive, are faced with the daunting task of industrial caliber cleanup.  Fortunately the United Nations, aware of the fact that almost every city on the planet suffered the consequences of Flints invention enlist the aid of revolutionary tech company, Live Corp for the actual cleanup.  Flint is awestruck when he discovers his childhood idol; scientific mogul Chester V (Will Forte) is leading the job personally.  Whats more- Chester enlists Flint directly to try to track down the rogue food-making machine so as to deactivate it once and for all with a device known as the BS-USB.

Lockwood, his girlfriend Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), dad Tim (James Caan), monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris), Baby er I mean Chicken Brent (Andy Samberg), overzealous cop Earl (Terry Crews replacing Mr. T.) and jack-of-all-trades Manny (Benjamin Bratt) travel from their temporary digs in San Franjose back to Swallow Falls which has apparently become overrun by a bizarre race of sentient food/ animal hybrids called, you guessed it: Foodimals.

What results is a pretty whimsical adventure/ expedition piece rather reminiscent of the later Jurassic Park films with heards of stampeding unnatural animals, adorable talking fruits, massive gentle giants and puns aplenty littered throughout a tropical jungle where once civilization existed.  Theres some good news and bad news in this- The good is that the writers of the sequel had to waste very little time developing their characters this time around as it is a literal continuation of characters (and actors), sets and even circumstances of the first movie.  The bad news is lack of character development nips this piece in its proverbial backside almost constantly to the point that the finished product doesnt feel like a solidly constructed story so much as a series of set-ups and plot devices to simply get the viewer to the next marquee moment. Yes, a lot of these marquee moments are clever, witty, creative and often funny, the problem is they come at the expense of the one thing the first film had in abundance: heart.

Make no mistake, this film manages to hit all of its marks and at times feels perhaps a bit too reformed and revised for its own good.  Kids will likely be enthralled with the ridiculously lush color pallet and larger-than-life characters and adults, especially those for a penchant for tongue-in-cheek humor & puns will find many opportunities to giggle as well.  In fact that leads me to about my biggest complaint of the piece: when judged on its own merit, its 95-minutes of pretty enjoyable and well-presented CG entertainment but it starts to feel a bit contrived and hollow when compared to the original.

On paper all of the pieces for success are present- even some slightly muddled themes of vegetarianism and anti-corporatism and an ending that doesnt quite offer the scale of resolve that the premise sets up, its still pretty tricky to come away from this one without a positive vibe and a few good laughs to boot.  And at the end of the day, isn't that exactly why we watch these types of movies in the first place?",1391990400,,4762,5.035623409669212

5218668,4,B0090SI39I,"Cloudy 2 was as entertaining as Cloud 1.  The animation and color clarity were astounding.  I'm 63 years old and have always been a cartoon freak...it is mind boggling what is coming out of Hollywood these days in this genre.  Highly recommend it, if not for anything more than the visuals.  We watched without the justification having to watch it with grand kids...we watched it on our own.",1391904000,,391,4.705882352941177
5218779,5,B0090SI39I,"If you like the first one, you'll also enjoy this one!  Funny, cute, and well done!  I love most all kids movies!  My almost 5 year old enjoyed it as well!",1391904000,,155,3.935483870967742
5218780,4,B0090SI39I,"Our family loved Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs, and we still watch it constantly. This sequel's trailers did not do it justice, because we weren't so sure it would be as good as the first one. After we watched it, my son (the picky one) immediately asked to watch it again.

For those who have seen the first movie, this is a good continuation of it. It stars Flint Lockwood, an aspiring inventor who is more of a Tim-the-Toolman-Taylor type where everything has always gone horribly wrong. His major invention in the first one, that turned water vapor into food, went awry and caused the residents of Swallow Falls to evacuate. This sequel begins after everyone has evacuated. Flint is still with Sam Sparks, the intern from the first feature, and they get the gang back together to return to Swallow Falls after being informed that ""foodimals"" have taken over the island. Flint goes on a quest to shut down his invention and keep foodimals from taking over the mainlands and the world.

This one is extremely cute and original. We were worried it would be exactly like the first one, and it wasn't at all. It was its own movie, with a brand new plot and set of jokes. The characters all still make people love them. Definitely worth watching over and over again with the kids.",1391904000,3,1282,4.593886462882096

There is plenty of adult humor to even out the humor designed for young children...so it's suitable for all ages.  Geeks will really enjoy the (not so subtle) tributes to Jurassic Park 1 and Star Wars (Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace).  The relationships between the characters is endearing and relatable to young and old alike.  I highly recommend this movie.

In preparation to watching the sequel we watched the original right before it. Yeah, by comparison it was kind of, well, stupid. The plot was okay, but the action was really rushed and the puns came so fast and compressed together that they were DOA. Hard to sit through the whole thing.

I also have Netflix, so I know that it was not my internet connection or hardware, as I  have absolutely no problem viewing movies utilizing Netflix with no buffering lag.  I rented the movie when we had time to view it, and didn't get the chance to try again (after 45 frustrating minutes with kids sitting in front of the tube with popcorn to watch it) within the 24 hour rental span for viewing.

Beyond nave, which would make him stupid, Flint has no problem jettisoning everything and everyone to join forces with a multitude of same-same-same employees bowing down to Chester V and his vision.

Flint is once again open to ridicule and scorn, once again the misunderstood misfit.  ""Everyone gets humiliated on national TV.""  If there's a message to be had, it isn't pleasant.

As for Amazon On-Demand, I still think the video and audio quality can't compete with Vudu.  The picture on Amazon tends to look a bit grainy and the audio is in 5.1 but I have to turn the volume way up to hear it properly.

5219702,4,B0090SI39I,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is a good follow-up to the original. However, being a sequel, it is not as good as the first. My main complaint with the second installment is that it does not quite have the heart that the original one did. It has some, but not to the extent of the original. The first one had some very touching scenes when *Spoiler Alert*
Flint's dad convinced him to shut down the machine and when Flint returns from destroying the machine.* End Spoiler
This one did not quite have the really touching scenes that the first one did. But, the heart in the movie not being quite as good are made up for with strong voice acting, particularly Will Forte, who has a great performance as the villain of the film, Chester V. With the exception of Terry Crews replacing Mr. T as the police officer, Earl, all of the rest of the cast returns from the original. Everyone does a fantastic job. The film also features some great music composed by Mark Mothersbaugh. The one way that this film does improve over the original is the absolutely eye-popping visuals. The first one also had some good visuals, but the animators did a great job creating a world of living food that looks amazing on screen. Overall, I give Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 four stars and an 8.5 out of 10 rating. While it does seem that it is intended for a slightly younger audience, there is still enough humor and great visuals so that it will appeal to everyone in the family. Overall, a very good family movie.",1391126400,,1507,4.444043321299639

5219807,3,B0090SI39I,"While it was never very popular, critically, I remember really liking Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  It wasn't the smartest or the most original (conceptually or in delivery) but it was cute; really cute.  The dialog and gimmick was well balanced and created a fast paced animated adventure that was a breeze to watch, easy and comfortable.  My kids lapped it up like it was candy (pun intended) and my wife and I sat back and enjoyed some mindless entertainment that wasn't mind-numbing.

The previews for Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 made this look like the bigger, better version of the same formula, and I was hooked almost instantly.

I had to see this.

Despite my clear desire to see this in the theater with my kids, I wound up seeing Gravity instead.  I made the right call.

It isn't that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is bad, because it isnt, but it wears out its welcome relatively quickly by thrusting all of its wit at you at once and exhausting its charm to the point where the second half starts to drag by not offering us anything new, improved or exciting.  I love the fact that the film literally picks up EXACTLY where the previous film left off, but the film also literally starts to dig its own whole the minute the opening scene is over.

As an obvious homage (and complete rip-off) of Jurassic Park, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 gives Flint Lockwood a whole new world to explore.  When he is recruited rather suspiciously by the famed inventor (and his personal hero) Chester V, Flint immediately sets out to make a name for himself and earn Chesters respect, but that is harder to do than he expected and soon he finds himself face to face with failure, that is, until Chester needs him to locate his food machine.  The problem is that the island Flint once inhabited is now densely populated by living food.  With his gang of misfits in toe (including the hilarious Earl as well as his monkey Steve and his girlfriend Sam), Flint sets off to find his machine only to have Earls true intentions reveal an evil plan Flint must prevent.

Yes, the food/animal mashups are fun, and the Jurassic Park inspirations are, in a way, inspired, but they cant carry this film and they are pretty much expected to.  The film is a handful of great ideas strung together with lazy construction.  Even the villainous Chester V (who the film never goes to any length to hide his villainy) feels like something weve seen before, and the admiration on Flints face mixed with the obvious disappointment that comes from realizing his idol is a lunatic felt very much like Up redux.  But, as I mentioned, my main complaint is that the film exhausts all of its good ideas so early on, to the point where there is nothing left to get excited over.

Although I will admit that I laughed at the celebrate reprise.",1391040000,8,2837,4.540275049115913

5219810,5,B0090SI39I,"So I really liked both Cloudy 1 and 2.
Some reviewers here just don't understand how creative this movie actually is.
how many animated films can you name that has food animals (foodimals)? You can scratch veggietales out of your minds because those characters are just food.
Would you ever cross a taco with a crocodile? or a chimpanzee with shrimp? how many people can think up an adorable strawberry as a heroic symbol?
You guys all bash on this sequel only because unlike the first film this one has no book.
If this story's book never existed would you all be even remotely interested to watch a children's animated film about food falling from the sky? If there was no Cloudy book to begin with I bet you all would love/hate both movies equally.

Now for those who say the plot sucked. Why did it suck? How is this plot unlike any other animated film's plot? The beginning is all happy, then there is a problem, characters go on adventure, try to fix problem(s), rescue missions, bad guy destroyed or banished or whatever, etc happily ever after. Name any animated movie that doesn't follow such plot...

Also some person said ""no character development""...dude this is Cloudy 2 TWO!!! if you want development of characters go watch Cloudy 1. The only new characters were Chester and Barb and all you needed to know was that they were the bad guys.
The only other characters were the foodimals and if you wanted a back story to those creatures then I suggest you pay attention to the films you watch.

Now jokes: sure some of the jokes were overused and Steve said ""Steve"" way too many times but do you know who voices Steve?
The Legen-wait for it-(thats right)-dary Neil Patrick Harris aka NPH aka Barney Stinson!!! Now NPH, in many of his films and especially his TV series How I Met Your Mother, uses or shall I say overuses many of his jokes over and over but thats what we fans of HIMYM love. We love that consistency and dedication to jokes that should be used over and over. Sure the impact of the jokes in Cloudy 2 were not as good as they are in HIMYM but then again we are talking about a children's animated film not a TV-14 show or PG-13 movie so its difficult to impact teens and adults. ""Challenge Accepted"". Plus children nowadays are much smarter and exposed to more grown up terms and jokes so kid jokes like those in Cloudy won't make much of a comedic impact. You can say that they used one or two jokes too many times but if you watch any modern day comedy you will see comedians use the same jokes over and over and over again.
Also if you have looked at Cloudy's cast you can see many of them are or were former SNL cast members meaning they have a knack for using and recycling jokes over and over again. Anna Faris is very consistent with her comedies as well. Andy Samberg and his crew the Lonely Island used to be part of the SNL cast. Bill Hader and Will Forte both former SNL cast as well. Plus if you have ever seen Terry Crews in other movies, him as Earl he was basically playing himself as an animated police officer. I mean need I say more? about jokes i mean

One person stated that there were Saturday morning cartoons better than this...are you talking about in this century or back in the 80's - 90's? I would agree if you said in the 80's - 90's but if you are referring to this century's cartoons then your appreciation for creativity and art is so low that I actually pity you for having a brain unable to create anything worth anything

There are others out here who said they hated the movie but never said an exact reason so I can go ahead and just treat your comments as if they never existed.

I'm not trying to persuade you to like this movie but instead of bashing on it blindly maybe take a moment and take into consideration the cast and crew, but also maybe compare it to other great movies that you did like and wonder what the differences are and if there are any similarities. Ask yourself ""Why did I like this film but not this one even though they both had...?""

A lot of what you like and dislike come from another source that influences you.
Take Transformers for example, people liked the first one because it was a classic autobots v. decepticons but once the 2nd one came out people bashed on it because there were no such race as the Primes in the cartoons.
Just like how Cloudy 2 has no book. You all scream there is no creativity but the entire thing is very creative because there was no previous ancestor. People are able to accept things they already know easier than things that pop out from thin air.
Whats a light bulb? This thing made of see-through material called glass that will have small metal wiring run in the middle that will generate something called electricity to make light similar to that of fire and the Sun. Oh you're crazy it will never work...Right

Cloudy 2 sucks...Right thats why it has 70% positive reviews on Flixster/Rotten Tomatoes",1391040000,,4930,4.427783902976847

The characters were off, the Chester V storyline was just bad, this felt like a rewrite of the first movie rather than a follow up.

On the up side, the food animals were cute and it was very visually appealing",1390953600,,323,4.193548387096774

5219868,2,B0090SI39I,"This film is a soulless retread of the first film.  The only thing memorable about it is the art direction.  The first film was a wonderful surprise to me, with great story, fantastic voice acting, memorable characters and unique art direction.  It stands as one of the few non-Pixar animated films worth seeing repeatedly.  What a tremendous opportunity has been lost here with this soulless cash grab.  Strangely, most of the original talent has returned here to reprise their roles and yet the dialog is so shallow and colorless that much of the time they sound like different characters altogether.  I have to wonder if the people who made this film even saw the first one, because the many of the characters act radically different from their original incarnations.  The sly wit that underpinned the first film is totally missing here, and it's absence is only magnified when many of the same jokes from the first film are repeated only to fall flat. I don't write reviews of films, but my disappointment with this sequel is such that I just had to speak up.",1390867200,,1063,4.744565217391305
5219869,5,B0090SI39I,my 3 grand children love this movie. The strawberry is the cutest thing ever. A big favorite here with us.,1390867200,,106,4.35
5219870,3,B0090SI39I,"Let's get something out of the way: I'm a 27-year-old guy, no kids, no particular love for family films (some are good, most are bad).  I caught the first CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS on television one day when I was just lazing around.  I couldn't turn away.  Hilarious.  A family film that didn't pander down to children; it featured quick, witty dialogue on top of the splashy visuals and sight gags.  Truly a film for the whole family, or just comedy lovers in general like myself.

So I got pretty excited about the sequel.  And at times, it didn't disappoint.  There's a definite ""LOST WORLD"" vibe going on in spots, with healthy doses of humor to create a truly unique comedy experience.  And then there's...well, pandering.  Some of it's in the set-up: our returning hero Flint Lockwood is summed by his childhood hero Chester V to help relocate the device that started all the trouble, and put a stop to it once and for all.  Except Chester V has a secret agenda, and he's just using Flint to achieve his master scheme.

The returning cast is great, though unfortunately Anna Farris's role is diminished.  We've got Bill Hader, James Caan, Andy Samberg, Benjamin Bratt, and Neil Patrick Harris back for the ride, along with newcomers Will Forte, Kristen Schaal, and Terry Crewes replacing Mr. T. for some reason.  The sight gags are back in abundance (kids will love it), and yes, there's even some of that quick and witty dialogue that helped the original stand out in a world of bland family cartoons.  That being said, the plot is slow to build, and eventually fizzles.  Plus, the climax features some rather dark overtones (was that actually a cannibalism reference?) that, while children probably won't fully understand, seem anachronistic with everything that's come before.  Final verdict: the first film was as much fun for adults as it was for kids (perhaps more so).  The sequel...well, your kids will enjoy.  And you will too, in spots.  But it's not as much fun as the first, it's not as funny as the first overall, and that's a shame.",1390867200,,2061,4.719887955182073

About six months later they come back to their hometown, where they encounter so many new species  foodimals like shrimpanzees and watermelophants  running around like in Jurassic Park.

If you think the story is silly, there is more to it. Flint Lockwood is now working for a conglomerate known as Live Corp, of which head is super-inventor Chester V (probably inspired by Steve Jobs). And Chester V happens to be Flint Lockwoods hero.

Like most sequels, Sony Pictures Animations Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 has a weaker story than the original. The idea of basically brilliant but mishap-prone inventor is no longer refreshing; it gets even annoying especially when Flint really does not know what he is doing.

There are so many colorful food-based creatures that are quite amusing to see. Like in Spielbergs famous movie, these foodimals steal the show from human characters. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is visually impressive, but don't expect too much from the story.",1388966400,,1206,4.980099502487562

5220170,3,B0090SI39I,"Much like its predecessor Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is filled with colorful characters, an imaginative plot, and a whole bunch of silliness.

Basic Plot: This time, Flints task to find his old invention and shut it down for good, because it just so happens that the Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator survived the kill code from movie 1. The FLDSMDFR has turned Flints old haunt into a food jungle filled with living food creatures (the foodimals). So Flint and his friends and family travel to their Swallow Falls to save the day. But things don't exactly go as they expected.

The Good:

Everyones favorite foods come to life as foodimals with names like tacodiles, su-sheep, shrimpanzees, watermelophants, and cheesespiders (that only want you to tickle their buns). The foodimals really add that spark of childhood wonder. Its impossible not to laugh at the antics and puns that these creatures provide. Moreover, the imagery, especially the food jungle, is spectacular (especially when you see it in theaters!). The world of CWACOM2 is filled with vibrant colors and goofy creations that complement the high energy of the film.

The Bad: There's a lack of originality in this film in comparison to its predecessor and the film really relies on the world it has created.  It lacks plot, doesnt develop the emotional journey of its characters as well as film 1, and tries to overcompensate for the former with a ton of thematic feel good messages that never quite meet muster. This is, in part, because the mayhem that makes this film so humorous sends the mind scattering in so many directions that its impossible to get a grip on something a little more solid, something that you can chew on, and just enjoy.

Overall: Bright and a bit cheezy, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is good for a chuckle. However, in terms of film development, its not as good as the original and is nowhere near the quality of Toy Story.  Its a movie parents can and should rent for a family fun night, but not quite purchase-worthy at a new release price.",1386547200,8,2081,4.779944289693593

5220172,4,B0090SI39I,"I'm not sure where all of the hate for this cute and funny family movie is coming from. Maybe the other reviewers got bitten by a Tacodile Supleme!

After having the opportunity to leave work early for a cheap movie date with my wife and 4 year old son, we ran to the local cinema to watch this highly anticipated flick. I'd never seen the original more than about 20 minutes in so I was open to the experience. I have to say that I and my family all REALLY enjoyed CwaCoM2 from start to finish! The characters were adorable and funny. The story had a quick enough pace to keep my son watching and the writing was lively. Some of the jokes from the commercials were even funnier in the context of the movie.

Since watching this in the theater opening week we've ordered CwaCOM and I've now seen the ensite film. I found it to be less entertaining than CwaCOM2 and a bit depressing. CwaCOM2 had none of that. Definitely looking forward to adding this one to our family movie collection ASAP!",1385424000,9,991,4.380434782608695

Some of my favorite foods come to life with names like tacodiles, shrimpanzees, cheesespiders and many more. Of course the 3D animation is amazing with great sights, and sounds bringing the magic of this story to life. The foods and vegetables are bigger than life and so exciting to see. One of my favorite scenes is when Berry tries to say Sam and it comes out anything but the name of Sam. Its sounds so funny! I have a lot of favorite foods in this film, but I must admit my ultimate favorite is the fluffy marshmallows. They are a family that is so cute and adorable.

In order for Flint and his friends save the world, they need team work, which is one big message in this film. Not only does Flint need the cooperation of his friends to make everything right again but he also learns a valuable lesson in doing so.
I like the way the story writers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, writes a great script with such powerful messages that even young kids can understand, enjoy and put into practice in their everyday lives.

Other voice talents in this film include James Caan (Tim Lockwood), and Andy Samberg (Brent McHale). Also Will Forte (Chester V) plays a great villain and really makes it where you do not like him at all and wishes he would just go away!

I recommend this film for ages 6 to 18. This is a film that the whole family can enjoy. I give it 5 out of 5 stars because it has a great storyline, a great message and the comedy is really funny.

I made an exception for this one since I enjoyed the original ""Cloudy"" so much.  Thanks to ""Cloudy 2"" I have sworn off theaters again.  At least if I rent a bad DVD I can turn it off and I haven't wasted so much cash.  When I spend $8 for a movie I hate to walk out after the first half hour.  I wasn't alone since a lot of other people walked out too.  I got the feeling that somebody in the management of the studio said ""We made a lot of money on Cloudy so we should make a sequel.  Don't worry if it isn't good since people will come to see it anyway.""",1383782400,8,655,3.843283582089552

Four years ago Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs proved to be an unexpected joyride. It was fun, energetic, and undeniably confident. The animation was unique and the story managed to be both care-free and focused at the same time. The characters and the small town they inhabit captivated me unlike any other animated film in recent memory, and the movie quickly became a favorite of mine. Hearing the announcement for a sequel brought out a child-like joy that I haven't felt in quite some time. While I personally didn't feel a sequel was necessary, I wasn't going to argue.

As one would expect, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 sees the return of Flint (Bill Hader) and the gang as we ready for another adventure. Picking up just moments after the original left off, the town of Swallow Falls is asked to relocate to San Franjose, California. Chester V (Will Forte) -- legendary inventor and CEO of Live Corp -- has tasked a team of his best and brightest to clean up the ruined town. What everyone doesn't know, however, is that the FLDSMDFR survived the explosion and Chester is out to find it so he can use it for his own personal scheme.

In many ways, this sequel improves upon a lot of the things I enjoyed so much about the original. The animation is still fantastic -- if not better -- and the environments are even more vibrant than before. In addition, the whimsical nature of the original is back and there's more than enough comedy to keep you laughing throughout. The food puns are non stop and, in my opinion, that's exactly how it should be. While some did feel a little simple, there were others that were extremely creative. Also, the use of food as a means to set up a joke was astounding. Some were there simply for comedic effect, while others took little jabs at RomCom cliches -- you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.

Unfortunately, I found that I walked away with more complaints this time around. For starters, this second serving is extremely formulaic, which makes the film become very predictable within the first fifteen minutes. In my opinion, while the Cloudy 2 may occasionally make fun of movie cliches, it isn't exempt from imitating those found in many animated films. It's very easy to see that Chester is the bad guy and it didn't surprise me at all when Flint was so easily manipulated. He turned on his friends, eventually came to his senses later on, and ended up apologizing. We've seen this formula time and time again, and it was a little disappointing to see it here.

Also, there's no denying that the story is more focused this time around and, personally, I think the movie suffered because of it. One of the things I loved so much about the original was that it was so over-the-top and all over the place. You never knew what to expect and this made the comedic scenes -- like the snowball fight -- that much more enjoyable. It had more of a ""I'm going to do what I want because I can and you just have to accept it"" attitude while this sequel is much more tame in comparison. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it was a little unexpected.

That's not to say the movie is bad, though. On the contrary, I had a blast even with its predictability. In fact, my sister and I -- 24 and 20, respectively -- were probably the two loudest people in the entire theater. I was giggling from start to finish and there's no doubt I had a goofy grin on my face as well. I love these characters and their world, so seeing them together again was more than enough for me. Also, I thought the foodimals were very creative and Barry is probably one of the cutest characters I've seen a long time.

Finally, in my opinion, the voice cast was excellent. With the exception of a few characters, the entire cast from the original returned to reprise their roles. Bill Hader and Anna Faris were, once again, great as Flint and Sam, and I was happy to see that Brent (Andy Samberg) and Flint's father (James Caan) had bigger contributions this time around. Terry Crews replaces Mr. T as Officer Earl and he nailed it. Truthfully, I didn't even know he got replaced until I looked it up prior to writing this review. He was that good. The characters are still unbelievably charming and full of life, and it's all thanks to the great voice acting.

Overall Score: 7.8/10 - Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 picks up right where we left off and I was perfectly okay with that. For many, the food puns and whacky humor are going to be a turn off, but that's exactly what I loved so much about the original. While the sequel's story may feel a little too structured in comparison, Cloudy 2 still makes itself worthwhile thanks to its characters, comedy, and beautiful animation.",1382918400,4,4778,4.5219907407407405

5220180,1,B0090SI39I,"Remember when you saw the Neverending Story and you loved it. Then you rented the Neverending Story 2 and said to yourself ""why did they tell the same story, only crappier.""

Or, how about the time you went to buy Finding Nemo, and actually purchased one of those rushed knock-offs with a superficially similar cover and you say to yourself ""I'm confused, this isn't what I expected.""

Or that time you went to the theater to see a good movie and accidentally sat through North instead?

That's Cloudy 2 in a nutshell.

I felt let down in a big way. I love kids films and I really loved the original Cloudy with Chance of Meatballs. The first film is fabulous, I'd seen it probably 150 times with my young nieces and nephews. My friends and I hyped ourselves up to see the sequel, we literally talked about seeing this film for months. We even paid the extra bit of money to see this in 3D. The movie had a rough start, and a few minutes in I'm thinking to myself ""so when is this going to get good?""

This was singularly the worst movie experience I've ever had in my life. Its simply awful, not in the ""so bad its good"" way, just painful. The movie is rushed, each scene irrationally shoehorns jokes and gags from the first film into the sequel. At no point, no where in this film, does it capture the charm of the original movie.

I genuinely felt bad for the cast and creators who slogged through the making of this film. At multiple points in the film, I got the feeling that Anna Faris was just having a bad day and didn't want to be in the studio.

I had never in my life walked out of a movie before I saw Cloudy 2. More than half of the audience walked out as well. I was seated near a group of stoned college kids who seemed very disappointed when they left (hey, Sony Pictures, way to miss your prime audience). Several parents escorted their children out in a gripe also (way to miss your other audience, too).

5220183,5,B0090SI39I,"If you missed the first film, you get a quick recap. Flint Lockwood and his friends leave their island but then return after it has been turned into a ""Jurassic Park"" with living food creatures. The soundtrack includes a smart blend of old 60's tunes redone and modern songs. For the older crowd there is the classic ""Butter/ Parkay"" line that the kids won't get. It also has some fun lines such as ""The jungle is no place for a monkey!""

This is a good family film. The food ""horror"" sequences are brief and are later turned around. There is also a ""Soylent Green"" segment near the end of the film, which like the evil food segments may be scary for younger kids.",1381104000,2,664,4.3983739837398375
5220184,5,B0090SI39I,"Directors Cody Cameron (Open Season3) and Kris Pearm (Animation Department of Surf's Up, Open Season2) revived in the most fun and heart-warming way, the characters from the original film (originally characters created from the children's book by Judi and Ron Barrett) to make ""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2"" one of the better animated sequels out there for the whole entire family to see.

This is new and fresh continuation of the story of Flint Lockwood, voiced amazingly by Bill Hader (The Mindy Project, The Awesomes), the energetic, slightly self-deprecating dreamer/inventor who wants to invent something to help better the world. He becomes a little more than confused and misguided when his inventor/'genius' idol, Chester V who is voiced by Will Forte (Lab Rats, Gravity Falls) gives him a mission where he thinks he will join the elite group of inventors that he only has only fantasized about in the past. Turns out his mission is - to `destroy' - wink, wink - his `FLDSMDFR' (Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator) invention which is about to overrun the world with dangerous, man-eating food!

Yup, food! They are the most colorful, creative and hysterical combinations of food that you'll ever see on the big screen that come alive as `animals' and living entities complete with personalities themselves. Their names are creative and their functions are hysterical. Everything from a Hamburger, Strawberries, Tomatoes, Potatoes, Squash, Melons...and so much more all have personalities and a purpose on this island where Flint originally created his food making machine from the first film and his friends and family once lived.

The part where your heart-strings are tugged is when his friends and especially his father, Tim Lockwood who is once again voice by the incredible James Caan (Las Vegas, Misery), both rediscover each other in the most unexpected ways. This is where both the kids and the adults in the audience will be able to relate to, with the most real sense of ownership because it's all about family.

Now of course there are complications, but Flint wouldn't be where he was for the most supportive, helpful and encouraging band of friends he has. Benjamin Bratt (Law & Order, Miss Congeniality) is back as Manny, Andy Samberg is back as the voice of Brent McHale), Terry Crews (Arrested Development, Scary Movie) is the voice of Earl Devereaux and back as the hysterical funny monkey named Steve, Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, Harold & Kumar) is again lending his voice to this often not-to-sharp monkey.

A new character voice of an ape named Barb is voiced sympathetically by Kristen Schaal (Toy Story 3, Shrek The Final Chapter) who learns a valuable lesson about trust and loyalty through the eyes of Flint and his friends. It's a fun, fast paced adventure filled with color and sound.

The movie is litered with several puns and play-on-words that it will keep you laughing throughout. A baby Strawberry named ""Barry"" with not only keep you in stiches but will surprise you with some amazing heroics at the end of the film. This is one of those few sequels that stand up to, and in some cases, exceed the original in entertaining you with humor and heart. Take the whole family to this one!",1380758400,12,3276,4.958105646630237
5220185,4,B0090SI39I,"In 2009, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was a massive hit for Song Pictures Animation.  The film pitched a unique idea of a secluded island that was deprived of any food - other than nasty, slimy sardines.  Along comes the troublesome Flint Lockwood and his talking monkey, Steve, and suddenly an endless amount of hysterical and excitement ensues.  There was so much excitement that the animated feature went on to gross $243 million worldwide in 2009, quickly prompting the question not if there will be a sequel, but when?  Flash forward four long years, and the adventure of Flint Lockwood and his rag-tag group of friends finally continues - in the highly anticipated sequel, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2.

Directed by Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 once again stars the voices of Bill Hader as Flint Lockwood and Anna Faris as Sam Sparks.  After the devastating food storm in the first film, the island of Swallow Falls must abandon their island while a clean-up effort takes place.  However, the clean-up is run by the devious inventor, Chester V (Will Forte) - who desperately wants to acquire Flint's food-making device for his own purposes.  When Flint and his friends return to the island, they discover that Swallow Falls is now inhabited by various forms of food species - most of which appear to be easily aggravated by the new visitors.  The group, including Flint's dad (James Caan), Brent (Andy Samberg), Steve the Monkey (Neil Patrick Harris), Officer Earl (Terry Crews), and Manny (Benjamin Bratt), are out to deactivate Flint's old food device before it wreaks anymore havoc to their home.  Kristen Schaal and Cody Cameron also star in supporting roles.

While the first film was based on the book, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs - by Ron Barrett, the film's sequel is not based on the book's sequel.  Instead, Cloudy 2 picks up right where the first film ends, still focusing on the same food machine that went on a food distributing rampage in the first adventure.  Initially, there was fear that this sequel would simply be the same story as the first film, just recycled - with the addition of a few new characters.  And, even though this new flick does introduce a bunch of new characters, the story is anything but recycled and almost revivals the uniqueness of its predecessor.  This new story is incredibly interesting and entertaining, focusing on a group of individuals going to an island full of rampaging creatures - sort of like a food variation of dinosaurs, making this film like an animated version of Jurassic Park.

The main character is enjoyable, but Flint Lockwood is a character this is easily overshadowed by his supporting cast.  Most notable in the supporting cast is a monkey that barely speaks more than ten words over the course of the film, but the few words the monkey does utter are well-time and nearly always hilarious.  Like the previous film, Steve the monkey's obsession with mustaches continues, even though gummy bears no longer seem to be an interest since they aren't mention.  Instead, Steve's facial expressions, constantly licking, and interest in cheesy items stand to make for some of the most outlandish and humorous moments of the film.  Along with Steve the monkey, Flint's dad - voiced by the stern sounding James Caan, also serves up a handful of laughs - many of which are interactions with a new group of pickle characters that are quickly comparable to Despicable Me's minions - only green.

As usual, the animation is an absolute pleasure to witness, and while the majority of films shot in 3D are a complete waste of money - animated films are usually the exception.  Even though this film is just as enjoyable in 2D, it might be worth the extra few bucks to see this film in 3D.  The colors will simply leap off the screen - especially whenever Flint unleashes his ""party in a box.""  With all of the additions of colorful characters, including the cheeseburger spider, strawberry, and monster taco supreme, every single frame is full of endless adventure of color.

Overall, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is just as entertaining as the first film, not to mention quality fun for the whole family.  There really aren't any negative things to say about this film.  It has all the elements to make a successful animated feature:  an interesting lead character, romance, a great supporting cast, and a decent amount of comedy.  There's little doubt that kids will just eat up what Sony is serving with this sequel, and oddly enough, the humor is direct and smart enough that even adults will find themselves chuckling on multiple occasions.  As far as how Cloudy stakes up against the year's previous animated films - well, it's not the best, but it's definitely not the worst.  Without a doubt, there is enough likeability in the Cloudy films that there should be enough fuel in the tank for at least a few more sequels.  Sony clearly has itself a hit and there's little doubt they're going to run with it for several more years to come.
