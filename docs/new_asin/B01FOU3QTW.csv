8761167,5,B01FOU3QTW,"I have 3 month old boy/girl twins and a 2 year old daughter.  We absolutely love Seeds Family Worship as a tool for teaching Scripture to our children.  We love that all of the songs are solely Scripture and no extra fluff!  We can learn word for word the Word of God.  The music is diverse and catchy, and the background pictures are great, too!  I often find myself singing the songs throughout the house as I go about my daily tasks and realize I've memorized Scripture without much effort.  It is very rewarding to see our 2 year old dancing and singing along and starting to memorize Scripture herself.  I look forward to her learning more and for the twins to follow in the same way.  It's very important for us to teach our kids about Jesus and to help them with reading the Word and memorizing Scripture.  Seeds Family Worship DVDs are an amazing tool to help us do that in a fun way!",1497830400,3,892,4.325301204819277
