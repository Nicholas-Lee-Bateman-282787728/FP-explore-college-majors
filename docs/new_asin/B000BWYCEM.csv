8159560,3,B000BWYCEM,I have bought a lot of Mary Higgins Clark films. I usually love her stuff but this film was a bit boaring. I about fell asleep watching it. The plot line is not much different from a lot of action/suspense films. I was disappointed because I know that Mary Higgins Clark has done a lot better. I have several of her films and I would have to say that this one is at the end of the list. The actors were good but the storyline was not so great. If it would have been the first of its kind I might have given it a better rating but there are too many other movies like it.,1267574400,,570,3.9224137931034484
