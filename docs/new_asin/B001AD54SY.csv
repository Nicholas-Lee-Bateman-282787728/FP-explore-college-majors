8277006,2,B001AD54SY,IS A BORE CD MOVIE,1525132800,,18,2.8
8277007,4,B001AD54SY,"Well, here we have Richard Attenborough as the rat-like bad guy. Different turn for him but then again this was from a very long time ago. We get a bunch of strangers on a plane that goes down in the pacific but that is not their only problem.....I won't tell you what it is but it is huge! The acting for the time is excellent. The characters are fun and worth seeing. I loved the story but it was a little predictable at times. of course the characters are the stock type and nonetheless very entertaining. the start of the DVD was kind of grainy but cleared up after 5 minutes or so.",1470096000,,586,4.1946902654867255
8277008,4,B001AD54SY,"This is a somewhat bizarrely scripted film. So as not to give away the story, I'll just say that plot elements include poorly maintained amphibious aircraft, a drunken pilot, the stewardess his girlfriend, the airline owner (who happens to be the drunk pilot), an angry underpaid copilot/engineer, a good cop, a snivelling informer, sharks (the human kind), sharks (the marine animal kind), a tired criminal, a small handgun, several doomed sheep, a scientist, revelling South Sea Islanders who generally appear Filipino, but aren't, acts of bravery and cowardice, oh, and did I mention a nuclear explosion?
""S.O.S. Pacific"" reminds me a bit of the original ""Day of the Triffids"" without the science fiction or stellar production values. Right.

Richard Attenborough, Pier Angeli and John Gregson all have roles, but in spite of a genuinely stellar cast (all of whom seem to be having an off day, every day of filming), this flic is so very, very bad, it goes all the way around to good again.",1443484800,,993,4.981927710843373
8277009,5,B001AD54SY,"IT IS NOT A FILM EASY TO FIND. . IT IS ONE OF THE FEW  MOVIES THAT EVA BARTOK AND PIER ANGELI  BOTH APPEARED IN. AS WELL AS EDDIE CONSTANTINE, THAT FRENCH  SINGER AND ACTOR WHO IS SO TALENTED. AND PLAYED IN A SERIES OF FRENCH COUNTERSPY MOVIES.  THE STORY IS QUITE GOOD AS WELL.  I WOULD BUY IT WHILE IT IS STILL AVAILABLE. SINCE IT IS AN OLDER MOVIE, AND COULD BE WITHDRAWN FROM CIRCULATION.  A.B.",1386547200,,398,4.103896103896104
8277010,4,B001AD54SY,"This is a watchable transfer... although it isn't perfect, the video and audio quality are adequate.  Since I am a bit of a purist, I was disappointed by the cropping of portions of the movie's picture (you can tell it is being done by the chopped-off words in the opening credits, and possibly this practice continues for the rest of the movie, I am not sure.)  Rather than remove portions of the original picture as seen in theaters, I would have preferred a 'framed' or 'letterboxed' DVD version instead, but I guess most people would have complained about that.  As far as the movie itself goes, some of the special effects weren't that well-done but may be passable for the time period.  For any male movie fans prone to drooling over Italian actresses, Pier Angeli looks smart in her stewardess uniform in this one!  ; )  Additionally the plane that crashes is an old prop boat plane, which was interesting as well.  Nice to have someone make this movie available.",1365120000,2,970,4.670588235294118
