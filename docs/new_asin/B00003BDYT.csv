7917200,5,B00003BDYT,"My son adores this video!  After what seemed like the 100th viewing, I decided to try other heavy equipment DVDs for variety.  He would have none of it.  Only Hard-Hat Harry.  It is interesting and Harry makes it fun, too.  Others in the Hard-Hat Harry series include a farm adventure, fire trucks, airplanes, etc...5 stars from my boy!",1146009600,,336,4.724137931034483
7917201,5,B00003BDYT,My dad digged up this video from a box of videos that were my little brothers when he was little.  I don't know what it is but my 2 year old son adores this video.  He has learned how to operate the VCR just so he can rewind it and watch it again.  I remember my brother had the same love for it when he was little.  I can see why some kids may not be to interested in it because it is really just alot of video taping of trucks with Hard Hat Harry and two kids that chime in.  I guess you just have to get it and see but if I am reviewing this on what my 2 year thinks of it it would get more than 5 stars.,1115942400,4,607,3.5681818181818183
7917202,4,B00003BDYT,"Hard Hat Harry is my 20 month old son's hero. He asks to watch this video over and over and over. My whole family can quote nearly the entire script. It's informative, entertaining and hypnotic to toddlers who like explosions, backhoes, dumptrucks, road construction equipment and lots of action. I highly recommend it to any parent who needs a 30 minute break. I gave it four instead of five stars because it's not the best production quality I've ever seen and the acting is not Oscar quality, but that doesn't matter at all to my son.",1043193600,2,537,4.604166666666667
7917203,5,B00003BDYT,"Our two year old boy loves this. I've occasionally tried to get him to watch something different, just for a change, but after about a minute he'll request the ""machine movie"". Inevitably you find yourself watching some of it too, and both my wife and I learned some interesting things about construction equipment. Compared to the I Love Big Machines series, Hard Hat Harry is a lot better than the kid who narrates I Love Big Machines (part 2, anyway), the dialog is better and more natural, and there's actually a decent song in this, unlike those songs by that whiny voiced guy in the I Love series.",1038096000,3,603,4.592592592592593
7917204,1,B00003BDYT,Received it yesterday. It is recorded in LP mode. The copy has both picture and sound problems. There is noise on the picture that cannot be tracked away (top of the line Sony VCR). It is like a home video recopied 5 times using bad equipment. The contents are fine but do not deserve a rating of even one star because of these problems.,1023235200,8,337,4.28125
7917205,5,B00003BDYT,"Both of my boys, now ages 3 & 5yrs, absolutely love this video and Hard Hat Harry, the Construction Genie who takes them on to great adventures.  My 3yr old even thinks dump trucks can talk!  This video takes kids right onto construction sites where they can see the big truck actually working.  And Harry reminds them about safety all through the video. A must for any kid who loves trucks!",1007596800,8,391,4.47887323943662
7917206,5,B00003BDYT,Very imformative and kept childs attention for whole movie.,1005523200,6,59,5.666666666666667
