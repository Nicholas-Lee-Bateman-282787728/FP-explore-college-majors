8502203,4,B006OSJK9Y,"Michael Phelps demonstrates his butterfly technique, various drills (for technique & conditioning), the track start and the butterfly turn. Bob Bowman explains everything and guides us through the video. The video is 42 minutes long. 7-8 minutes are spent with Bowman ""interviewing"" Phelps, which is meant to give messages regarding training attitude. It features beautiful shots, including underwater and at the water-air boundary. This DVD is well worth its price, even if you are an experienced swimmer and already know the technical stuff, because watching Michael's excellent technique is great motivation for your next training. The reasons for not giving five stars are purely technical: It's not region-free and the image quality is not as good as you'd expect from a DVD.",1046131200,8,780,5.401639344262295
