8666105,5,B00LIBCOLI,"Very informative and well produced.  It should be a longer movie though.  As depressing as watching it was, it is a subject that was artistically discussed while revealing very important facts about student debt.",1431561600,,212,5.205882352941177
8666106,2,B00LIBCOLI,"I am a professor and begged my university's library to get this film to show in my Sociology of Education class. It was completely underwhelming. Only 23 minutes long, very limited information, and not even as good as the (free on YouTube) competition,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Default-the-Student-Loan-Documentary/dp/B007GUHYKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Default: the Student Loan Documentary</a>. When they say that major political figures like President Obama and Elizabeth Warren are ""featured"" in the film, they mean they have inserted old media segments (briefly) featuring those individuals, not that they have interviewed them for the film. Slightly less serious, but still distracting, the editing/filmography is not of professional quality. Very disappointing for both me and my students.",1406073600,,848,6.718181818181818
