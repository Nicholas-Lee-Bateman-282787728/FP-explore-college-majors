3052704,5,B0010WAC50,I bought this DVD for my grand daughter when she was less than 2 years old and not talking yet. She enjoyed watching the children in it. She is now 3 and loves to sing a long with the songs. We watch it all year long. I highly recommend all of the Cedarmont Kids DVDs (we have several). I seriously believe they help a child's speech development. Also helps build their self confidence as they imitate the children on the DVD.

3052709,1,B0010WAC50,"The songs on the DVD are great.  No complaints there.  But, I believe the DVD we were sent must have been old
because as you will see if you watch the DVD, these were produced a long time ago.
The first day we listened to it the volume fluctuated up and down on its own.  Any other DVD we tried to play worked
just fine, but this one has volume issues - loud, soft, loud, soft - on its own.
I tried to return it to Amazon for an exchange of a working DVD but they would not do the exchange.",1382054400,,490,3.8316831683168315
