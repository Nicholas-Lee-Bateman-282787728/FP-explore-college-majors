458672,5,6302409829,"I have always loved Steve Martin, and that is no exception with this movie.  Martin's portrayal of the father's mid-life crisis is great; funny without being overplayed.  Kimberly Williams is fabulous in this movie.  I  think it is sad that we did not see her in more movies following this one.  Her performance is captivating and quickly makes you fall in love with her  character.  You feel her wedding excitement and nervousness.  Martin Short  adds greatly to the film in his hilarious role as the wedding  coordinator.
The story line is obviously not overcomplicated, but it  still keeps you involved and interested in what will happen next.  A solid  cast and great direction make this a true treat to watch.
I LOVE this  movie, and am do glad to see it come out on DVD since my VHS copy is  practically worn out, and I can finally see it in widescreen again. Get it,  you will love it.",945129600,7,892,4.550632911392405
458673,5,6302409829,"I absoultley ADORE this movie!  Steve Martin is hilarious and perfect for his part.  New-comer,(at the time)Kimberly Williams was so precious and had the most perfect personality for the part!  Fra`nk, played by Martin Short,  gave the movie the little touch that it needed.  Overall, this more gets my  two thumbs WAY up!",919900800,3,322,4.981132075471698

458774,5,6302409829,"This is a great movie. You know why? Its more than just about an overprotective dad. Its about opening your heart to change growth and everyone can relate to that. Grumpy and set in his ways (which have no doubt brought him success), narrow-minded, old fashioned dad meets a young, innovative, golden retriever type of man who has become fianc to his darling daughter. One expensive catastrophe after the next (along with a lot of laughs), Martins character must hit rock-bottom before realizing that change and acceptance is the best way. Bonus: Martin Short as flamboyant party planner with a mystery accent and Steve Martin steaming up the screen with a sexy little dance in a too-tight suit. What more could one ask for? Also featured is a pointless, flat, little brother character who must have been cast simply because hes Makullay Culkins little dwarfy brother.",1520812800,,868,4.9520547945205475

458919,3,6302409829,"This movie portrayed many family themes.  The most important theme revealed was marriage.  This theme was the most imporatant because it followed more of a traditional way of marriage. Over time marriage has become something individuals aspire to after they are established.  In this film Amy and her fianc Bryan are very young in age and decided that they would like to spend the rest of their lives together. This did not break too many norms of the time of the film, but as of today many people would view getting married at the age of 22 as breaking norm",1481155200,,558,4.56

459130,1,6302409829,"It's as though the father is an alien, stuck in a family with somebody's bizarre ideas of what is important. By what chattle-exchange custom is it the responsibility of the bride's parents to pay for anything, let alone a wedding in which the father's absence, while he deals with practical matters, isn't something that matters to either the selfish daughter or his wife, played as ultra-frump by Diane Keaton, a part she plays all too well. (She is dressed as badly in this movie as in 'First Wives Club). The supporting cast is very good and, thankfully, offer comic relief, but even the parents of bride and groom counting the days until the daughter gets pregnant, so they can be grandparents - without which, it seems, they would die of despair. Good grief. I agreed to watch this movie with a friend, thinking Steve Martin could save it, but it was hopeless. Heck, even the bride's dress is the most wretched I've seen anywhere - the daughter is tiny, and the dress looks to be made for an elephant with bad taste, so you can't even say, ""Well, the dress was nice.""",1417910400,,1072,4.588541666666667

459179,5,6302409829,"We watched this movie countless times, when we felt like watching a comedy. Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are at their best in acting as Steve Martin Plays 'George Banks' who is the father of the bride, and is having a huge problem of letting go. When his young, beautiful daughter tells him at the dinner table that she's getting married, Steve Martin's reaction is both hilarious, and touching.

Diane Keaton plays the level-headed wife, and mother of the bride. While George is still in shock over the wedding, he meets his future son-in-law, and new in-laws. As the movie progresses, the fun becomes laugh-out-loud family entertainment. As George begins to hang onto a very thin string, he agrees to plan the wedding with an off-the-wall wedding consultant, who loves George's charge cards. George's visit to the in-laws lands him in their pool, with two viscous dogs growling at him. To make matters worse, George completely looses it in the supermarket, which lands him in jail.

The more you watch this movie, the more you laugh. Martin Short plays the perfect funny wedding consultant, who has you laughing in hysterics.

She comes back and is engaged instead.  Her parent's pay for the wedding.  It's huge.  It's expensive.  Girl gets her way.  Very selfish.  They try to make like the daughter isn't selfish by showing one scene where she has a magazine article on how to save money on your wedding.  They make like it's a bad thing to defy society's norms and to save money.  The only person who is the voice of reason (the dad), they make him out to be an idiot throughout the entire movie until the very last scene.  Overall, it was hard just to watch.

459443,3,6302409829,"The original 1950 film starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor is one of the best films of the 50's.  It is smart and endearing and transcends mere comedic punch lines to deliver a finale that made me tear up and still remains a swell in my heart.  This 1990 remake starring Steve Martin is less impressive as a whole because it replaces the genuine sentiment with a layer of saccharine and then nixes the well timed wit for more abrasive and outlandish `laughs'.  It is a straightforward comedy, where the original was a smarter and more genuine experience.  That said, Steve Martin is at his best and he really delivers a strong comedic performance and he always handles the schmaltz with class.  Before I saw the original, I liked this film a lot more because in my eyes it was doing exactly what it set out to do, and in a sense it really is.  This isn't trying to be the original.  This is trying to be a more outlandish comedy in the same vein of the comedies popular in the early 90's.  That's why this film stars Steve Martin, Diane Keaton and Martin Short.  Spencer Tracy was just a different breed of actor and thus turned out a different breed of film.  Comparing the two films does this remake a disservice, because it cannot compare.  Judged on its own merits, it succeeds in a lot of ways, but it will always be somewhat tarnished in my eyes thanks to the magnificent 1950's classic.",1339459200,,1401,4.4763779527559056

459448,5,6302409829,"""Father of the Bride"" is one of the best movies ever produced.  This film features comedy, yet it also has a very sincere tone. It does a great job of depicting what a father goes through when his daughter gets married.  Steve Martin does an excellent job portraying a father, George Banks, who is about to lose his little girl to marriage.  Banks is a fanatic character who experiences all of the emotions involved when your little girl grows up.  Perhaps the reason I like this movie so much is because it reminds me of the relationship between my father and I.  I have yet to marry, but when I do I know it will be tough on my daddy.  As with George Banks, my father will be reluctant to let go in the beginning.  However, just as George Banks did in the movie, my father will warm up to the idea and come around eventually.

This movie definitely has it's share in sentimentality, especially towards the end, pretty much most of the last thirty minutes, but it is still funny, and you don't lose interest in it. A great family comedy, it is pretty much funny for all ages. This is a good movie to sit down with the entire family and watch.

There is a total lack of quality physical or verbal humor to alleviate the simpering sentimental tone of this film... and I like crappy sentimental films! The writing of the film is certainly most to blame and Steve Martin's narration makes me want to kill myself and frankly I've never seen him so totally unfunny. The same goes for Martin Short who can ordinarily make almost anything funny... but here uses an excessive accent, costuming, and hairdo to little comedic effect. Diane Keaton's faux mistiness as the loving mother is a total betrayal of all the good work she has done over the years. It's hard to blame the bland supporting cast for this disaster... I mean they memorized their lines and delivered them. What else could they do? However, no doubt to their dismay, this film was not a career starter for anybody that wasn't already a big deal. Eugene Levy's 20 second cameo is really the best this tripe offered. Take a pass on this one unless you like this genre at its worst.",1209254400,4,1170,4.6028708133971294

459538,5,6302409829,"You know those rare times when you see two actors really play well off of each other?  That's what you'll see between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton in Father of the Bride.  Even if this movie were rotten (and let me be clear - it is far from rotten), the interaction and chemistry between Martin and Keaton would be well worth your viewing time.  The two actors have accompanied each other to the Academy Awards a few times, so their on screen magic must have been in part because Martin and Keaton genuinely like each other.  I went into this movie wanting to love it - in my view, Steve Martin is a comedic genius, and Diane Keaton is a fine and incredibly versatile performer.  I didn't expect to enjoy their interactions as much as I did, so considering my expectations were high to begin with you can understand why I recommend this film.  Remakes can be hit or miss, and this one is right on target.",1200096000,,905,4.389221556886228
459539,5,6302409829,"George Banks (Steve Martin) has just heard the words every father dreads.  His daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) has just announced that she's getting married to Bryan (George Newbern), a man she met while studying in Europe.  While George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is thrilled by the news, George doesn't handle it well.  After all, this means big changes happening in his life.  And he doesn't cope well with change.

So, naturally, he handles this the way any dad would.  He starts watching ""America's Most Wanted"" in case Bryan is on it.  And when it comes to planning the wedding, his idea is cheap and informal, much to the women's dismay.  Will he ever get with the program?  And if he does, will he survive the big day?

This movie isn't a laugh until it hurts comedy.  There are plenty of laugh out loud parts, but the humor is often subtler.  While some of George's antics are definitely over the top and border on embarrassing, the movie manages to find the balance between embarrassment and humor.  And the ending it truly touching.

And I can't say enough about the acting.  Everyone is believable.  In fact, what makes the movie work is the fact that every one of the characters and actors seems absolutely real.  The exception, of course, are Franck and Howard, the over the top wedding coordinators played by Martin Short and B. D. Wong who absolutely steal every scene they are in.

Whether you've gone through a wedding or not, this movie will make you laugh and touch you.  And what more could you want from a wedding, and movie, then that?",1198627200,8,1561,4.652014652014652

459600,4,6302409829,"Whereas many remakes of beloved films stumble and fall, this ""Father of the Bride"" shines in its own right.

The wonderful Steve Martin steps into Spencer Tracy's shoes (no enviable task)as the harried and worried father of the bride, George Banks.

Diane Keaton is lovely as Nina, George's wife and mother of the bride.  She provides the grounding voice of reason to George's hysteria, much as Joan Bennett's Ellie did in the original.

Kimberly Williams is simply a breath of fresh air as Annie, the bride (taking the place of Elizabeth Taylor's Kay). Her enthusiasm, excitement and joy over her upcoming nuptials simply jump off the screen.

George Newbern as Bryan, the prospective groom, is solid and he proves to be as stable to Annie's excitement as Nina is to George.

Martin Short as Frank the wedding coordinator is priceless.  His theatrics and mannerisms alone make this movie worth watching.

Kieran Culkin is appropriately cute as Annie's younger brother Matt.

The best parts of this movie?  The sheer comedy. Martin's Banks is far more comedic than the more stoic Banks as played by Tracy - - Martin doesn't even need to speak, his expressions are priceless by themselves.  Martin and Keaton also share a witty and comfortable banter that was not expressed in the original (where Tracy and Bennett slept in separate twin beds, as was the custom back in the 50s)  The genuine love and affection between Annie and Bryan is also more evident in the remake, versus the almost too-proper courtship of Kay and Buckley in the original, where Kay announces she is marrying as if she is announcing an upcoming test or rainstorm.

That aside, though, the Tracy version seems somehow more solid and honestly touching than the remake. Without the comedy masking the true feelings, we can feel the honest pain and sadness that Tracy's Banks feels at losing his only daughter.

Additionally, the money angle plays a larger part in the remake.  We understand that Martin's Banks owns his own company (a sports shoe manufacturer) but $250 per head? And a pricey wedding planner/coordinator?  Whereas the original film dealt with Banks' fear and confusion over the financial aspects of the upcoming wedding, the remake really hits home how costly everything is - - if you want to travel first class, that is.

Overall, the message is the same as in the original.  Father loves his daughter, who he only wants to be happy, even if it means relinquishing her to another man.",1158883200,4,2471,4.884892086330935

Then I was freakng out because the little boy that played his son looks like the exact replica of the little boy in Signs--but how could that be those films were more than a decade apart.  Did a quick search and found that the two actors are brothers.  But they could pass for twins when they were younger.  Anyway, back to the movie.

I remember remarking to someone that I saw an absolutely hilarious movie but couldn't remember the name. After the Martin-version trailer played, I exclaimed: ""That's it!"" Since then I have purchased both versions and watched them numerous times. I also have part-two of the original and the remake. The Martin version is a fresh adaptation of the original. I can't imagine anyone has not already seen this lighthearted comedy about the emotional and financial sacrifices experienced by the father of the bride. I'll save you another read of the plot description and just provide an endorsement for hilarious entertainment.

A number of scenes are priceless. Martin's facial expressions as his daughter is transposed back to gradeschool while telling him she is engaged is a riot. The ""talk"" with the bridegroom is great. The wedding planner scene is a gem. Not to be overlooked is the comedy of errors involving the sensational meeting of the inlaws.

Martin of course wants to find fault with his future son-in-law, and does everything he can to sabotage the wedding plans, which are pretty expensive if you ask me.  ($250 a head for 1272 people??).  Diane Keaton does a stalwart job as Nina, Martin's patient but frustrated wife; Kimberly Williams is fine as Annie, the soon to be bride; George Newbern is a solid groom to be;  and Kieran McCaulkin is a delightful and warm little brother.

I recently bought the new edition for 12 bucks from Best Buy-  and it was a bit of a let down.  It DID have more than just the theatrical trailer... but only 15 minutes more- a conversation between martin and short, as well as a 10 minute ""behind the scenes"" talk with the director, producer, and some of the actors.  The picture quality also leaves much to be desired for an ""anniversary edition.""  It tends to jitter a bit and there is a lot of 'old film noise.'

459617,4,6302409829,"I suppose I never saw Steve Martin replacing Spencer Tracey or Kimberly Williams replacing Elizabeth Taylor. The original film directed by Vincente Minnelli had charm and a number of fabulous sequences in it but Charles Shyer's film nicely updates the original film with some gut busting laughs for the ironic age. Shyer's films have a number of nice touches and references to other films including Martin commenting (as Banks) that he doesn't want to be bankrupt by the wedding and have to wander the streets in a bathrobe (a reference to Carl Reiner's film ""The Jerk"" starring Martin): Bank's character is named after George Banks (David Tomlinson) from the Disney classic ""Mary Poppins""; the Bank's character's middle name of Stanley is borrowed from the father in the Spencer Tracey original and loads of other references to classic Hollywood films. This is the third turn for ""Father of the Bride"" (it was also a short lived TV series in 1960) and it's still delightful although this 15th Anniversary Edition is a year premature (the film came out in 1991).

George Banks' (Steve Martin) little girl Annie (Kimberly Williams) is getting married. All of the mayhem that you can imagine in a Steve Martin PG comedy ensues. Kimberly is marrying her college sweetheart Bryan (George Newbern). Banks doesn't have a problem with the concept of his daughter getting married but he does have an issue with his little growing up because, well, it means he's getting old, too. With delightful comic turns by Martin Short (as the wedding coordinator) and Diane Keaton, ""Father of the Bride"" unlike most remakes manages to update the material and make it work for a modern audience without betraying the emotional core that drove the comedy in the original film.

This version of ""Bride"" gets the deluxe treatment  i the 15th Anniversary Edition. I don't know honestly if all of these featurettes and the commentary track were on the 2003 edition. I'd suspect they were and this is just a re-release in new packaging. The previous edition released two years ago was a nice anamorphic transfer.  The sharp image quality and remarkable clarity evident here is a slight improvement over the original DVD release (although the previous version looked pretty darn good, too). It appears that the same transfer was used for this version and the film was tweaked a bit for the latest release. The 5.1 soundtrack

I seem to recall the extras here being the same as on the previous edition but that could just be faulty memory on my part. Either way, ""Martin & Short Interview Each Other"" is an amusing 5 minute, bizarre tongue-in-cheek featurette where they skewer each other, the roles they play and everything else in sight. At one point Short talks about how playing a woman liberated him in this film. He plays a man. We also get an 11 minute standard ""Making of"" featurette on the film with some amusing behind-the-scenes takes on the film.

Director Charles Shyer's commentary track is both informative and funny. Shyer discusses the challenges of directing a remake of a classic film. He notes that it's a fine line bringing a contemporary tone to the film but not playing with it or improving it into ""a failure"". It's particularly interesting to note that Shyer and Meyers both have a high regard for the original film. Hence, the things that worked well in the original (such as the opening monologue) are just updated (and, according to Shyer it took 35 takes to shoot the opening because of a number of technical issues that kept occurring). It's a pity we don't have Martin's comments or, for that matter, other cast members since Shyer recorded the commentary track 13 years after the film's original release (and he hadn't seen it since he finished working on it in 1991).

You're invited to a very funny wedding featuring funny men Steve Martin and Martin Short with able support from funny woman Diane Keaton. A delightful update of the 1950's classic, ""Father of the Bride"" has a number of moments that ring true for me from my experience with my sister. If you have the previous edition of the movie I don't know that I can recommend upgrading but if you haven't purchased until now, Buena Vista Home Video has priced this to move.",1117584000,23,4235,4.8411602209944755
459618,5,6302409829,"A remake of a classic 1950 Spencer Tracy movie, Father Of The Bride is Steve Martin at his best. A fun comedy the entire family can enjoy, Father Of The Bride is great entertainment. When the daughter of George and Nina Banks announces her engagement, Nina is thrilled - but George has a difficult time handling the life changes that accompany his only daughter growing up for good. One of Steven Martin's funniest films, this is one movie you won't want to miss...

George Banks (Steve Martin) lives the perfect life. He has a great job, a nice house, a beautiful loving wife Nina (Diane Keaton), and two great kids. But George's world is shattered when his 21-year-old daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) returns home from college to announce she's engaged. Her fiance, Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), is a great guy, but when he puts his hand on Annie's leg, all sorts of feelings and emotions erupt inside George. It isn't her choice of a marriage partner, but rather her decision to get married at all that bothers George. He wants his little girl to remain a little girl forever, and he must now face the fact that he can't control the changes in his ideal world...

Father Of The Bride offers a number of hilarious scenes as plans for the wedding go forward. Annie and Nina hire an extremely feminine male wedding planner, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short), whose annoying accent and take-charge attitude continuously rub George the wrong way. Deciding to have the wedding at the family home, the Banks's daily lives are turned upside down by all the last minute changes and typical pitfalls of an impending wedding. These comic sequences leading up to the big event are responsible for most of the humor and hilarity in the film (especially Martin Short's character). But will the wedding go off as planned? Will George come to accept his daughter's growing up? Or will she break off her engagement to Bryan? Father Of The Bride is a touching, romantic comedy you'll never forget.

Steve Martin stars as his usual likeable self, utilizing great body language and years of experience in the comic realm in order to provide the perfect likeness of a father in just such a situation. Not too over the top, and quite believable in every way, Father Of The Bride stands in stark contrast to the comedies of today which tend to go way overboard in their attempts to be funny. Outlandish comedies have their place, but sometimes its nice to able to laugh without having to suspend your sense of reality first. Father Of The Bride does well in this respect - similar to Christmas Vacation.

Overall, Father Of The Bride is a light-hearted family comedy with quite a bit of charm. Steve Martin and Diane Keaton form a likeable married couple, and the middle-class family life projected by the Banks family is something with which most viewers can identify. Because of its feel-good, light-hearted humor, Father Of The Bride is a definite must-see movie... Don't miss it!

I don't think I quite love them as much as she does, but they're good for an afternoon, of switching your brain off, and not having to think. (And then you have to think afterwards if you switched your brain back on - oops!)

Featuring a very young and angelic Kieran Culkin, this movie is definitely family-orientated, and also features the excellent Martin Short - although you need the subtitles in order to understand him! He's the best thing about these movies, and has great comedic timing. (Look out also for Eugene Levy and also in the sequel - but in the latter, he plays a different character!) Most of the characters are a little too Brady Bunch but sometimes, but Martin Short's memorable role will have you laughing for hours afterwards. The (second) best thing about this movie is Steve Martin's portrayal of the worried father, who's stressing about money.

There's no extras on this DVD, as you'd expect from such an 'old' movie - yet we can have films from the 70s, 80s with extras on them.

Forty-one years later,Steve Martin portrayed the father(his character is George Stanley Banks) and Kimberly Williams was Annie,the bride. Martin narrated the film,himself on camera in the first scene,dressed in the tuxedo he wore at Williams' wedding. Annie's romance with Bryan MacKenzie began six months before their wedding. Annie was studying architecture in Rome,where she met Bryan(George Newbern). According to the scene where Bryan went to the Banks' home to meet Annie's parents,Bryan went to Annie to ask for directions and one thing led to another. George left his workplace,Sidekicks,an athletic shoe factory which he runs,immediately after he was told that Annie had arrived home. For a homecoming gift,George buys her a ten-speed bike,all polished and ready to ride. Then,Annie announces her and Bryan's engagement at the dinner table to her father,her mother Nina(Diane Keaton) and her brother Matt(Kieran Culkin,MacCaulay's brother). George is very shocked,believing she's too young to get married(Annie is 22 and Bryan is 26). Bryan is an independent communications consultant,which he assembles and connects communication systems. Then,George and Nina go to the home of David and Joanna MacKenzie,Bryan's dad and mom. They toast the wedding of their respective children and other joyful events that will possibly follow(i.e. Annie's and Bryan's children). At one point in the film,a heated argument between Annie and Bryan causes them to split up and cancel the wedding. The Bankses meet with a wedding coordinator named Franc Eggelhoffer(Martin Short with a European accent). The glorious wedding day comes in early January,following a snowfall(a rarity in Los Angeles).

The one who stands out, as many people know, is the wonderful Steve Martin who gives a terrific, hilarious performance as George Banks, a father who just wants to see his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) after she has returned from Rome.  His reaction to her announcement is stupendous.  I love the way the producers decided to suddenly make Annie a little girl of probably five years old.
Diane Keaton is wonderful as George's wife, Nina.  She is the one who is in control the whole time, and who keeps her husband from doing really stupid things.  I especially loved the scene where she goes to bail him out of jail and makes him promise a few things before letting him out.  It was great!  Kimberly Williams is wonderful as Annie Banks.  You can really see how much she loves her dad, even when he does not-so-smart things, like taking the McKenzie's bank book and then accidentally throwing it into the pool, which results in *him* falling into the pool!
And how can anyone forget Martin Short.  He was so, so funny as Franck (not Frank!), the Wedding Coordinator.  His accent is so funny and very original.

459748,4,6302409829,"Up front, I've got to admit that I'm probably less qualified to review a movie than many of the other reviewers here.  I don't see that many movies, and I have no idea if a transfer to DVD is good or bad.  What I do have is a good sense of what I like, and of what made me laugh or cry, love or hate, or be interested or bored.
This movie made me laugh, and a few of the scenes have rattled around in the back of my head for a long time, causing me to laugh whenever they decide to come forward.
After identifying the leads, I will give a very brief synopsis of the plot, then on to some highlights, as I remember them:
George Banks, played by Steve Martin, is the title character.  Nina Banks, George's wife, is portrayed by Diane Keaton.  Their daughter, the bride to be, Annie Banks, is played by Kimberly Williams.  And, if a comedy can be said to have its own comedy relief, that is provided by Martin Short as Franck Eggelhoffer, Wedding Consultant.
Plot:  Annie comes home from 6 months abroad and tells her parents that she is engaged to be married.  George is not too happy about this, as he is not ready for his daughter to leave home.  He is finally convinced to give in to the inevitable, and the wedding planning begins.  The plot line follows through the wedding preparations and the wedding, itself.  Like most light comedies I've seen, the plot merely provides a setting for the comedy to follow.
As in a few of my other reviews, I'm doing this from memory, so I may occasionally be ""off"" in the details.  Forgive me my errors or omissions.
One of my impressions from early in the movie is how thrilled George is when told that the wedding will be at home.  He has visions of a backyard get-together where he fires up the old barbecue and cooks burgers for everyone.  Boy, is he in for a surprise.
Enter Franck Eggelhoffer, the wedding planner your mother warned you about.  Each time he opens his mouth, and Nina and Annie nod their heads in agreement, George rightfully visualizes another few thousand dollars flying out the window:  An enlarged back yard, a tent for a few hundred guests, thousands of dollars worth of wiring, live swans, ice sculptures, caterers, musicians, you name it.  Nothing, and I mean nothing, is too much.
Franck has an unidentifiable accent that cracked me up every time he opened his mouth.
All of this proves too much for George and he goes bezerk.  At his most fragile, he goes to a supermarket to buy some hotdogs and buns for an at home barbecue one evening in the middle of the planning period.  One step from a straight jacket anyway, he cannot cope with the fact that there are  different quantities of hot dogs and buns in their respective packages.  He rants and raves and begins to tear the package of buns to shreds.  Finally, the police are called and he, the respected middle-class professional from San Marino, CA, is arrested.  Words don't do justice to this scene, it must be seen to be appreciated.
Then there's the day of the wedding, unusually warm as I remember.  The guests are greeted by flooding caused by melting ice sculptures, swans running wild, and other colossal mishaps.  Again, it must be seen to be appreciated.
The wedding does go off, and there is a final scene of father and daughter, always in separate parts of the house, desperately searching for one another for a final goodbye before she leaves on her honeymoon.
Evidently, this movie was too slapstick for some people, but in my opinion, the ""wild and crazy guy"" kind of humor was one of the main justification for remaking a good 1950's movie that had starred Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor as father and daughter.",1049846400,,3657,4.506060606060606
459749,3,6302409829,"""Father of The Bride"" is one of those rare instances in filmdom where I think the remake has actually improved on the original. Director Vincente Minnelli's ""Father of the Bride"" starred Spencer Tracy as harried George Banks and the stunning Elizabeth Taylor as his daughter, Kaye. And although I have a great affinity for both these performers, in retrospect neither seems to be served well by the dated and stagy source material.  Forget the 50s sexual politics which, for its time, must have seemed cutting edge. It's the Salvidor Dali-esque dream sequence that continues to haunt me.

How wonderful then to experience Steve Martin's tender take on George and Kimberly Williams (now renamed Annie) as his effervescently head-strong daughter. The story - that of a harried and overly protective father suddenly faced with the reality that his little girl is getting married - is nearly identical to the original, and yet it's strangely and wonderfully fresh and different. Martin Short makes a welcomed edition to the cast as Annie's flamboyant wedding coordinator Frank Engelhoff (played straight in the original by Leo Genn). George Newbern costars as the groom (Bryan McKenzie now, Buckley Dunston in the original). Dianne Keaton, B.D. Wong and Kate McGregor-Stewart are all welcomed additions of inspired casting. There is a sense of enduring poignancy to this film that I found completely lacking in the original.

The DVD transfer from Touchstone/Disney is in a word, unacceptable. It's widescreen - yest, but not anamorphic. Contrast levels are way too low. And although there are no digital anomalies to speak of (aliasing, shimmering, edge enhancement, et al) color balancing is incredibly weak. Interior scenes are either excessively pink or very orange while exterior night scenes tend to be awash in an undistinguished mesh of midnight blues. Fine detail is never fully realized. There's a decided hazy quality to the entire film that makes it look much older than it actually is. Several scenes are very blurry while overall the picture is only moderately sharp at best. The soundtrack is Dolby 2-channel and adequate, I suppose - - but just barely. There are no extra features. This is definitely a film that could stand a new ""Vista Series"" deluxe edition!",1048723200,2,2273,5.154471544715447

Its pretty sad becuase steve martin has some classis movie but this is not one of them...i mean the movie goes just a tad overboard..I suggest u buy movie like the parents trap.but don't waste ur time on this..,1048291200,4,470,4.541176470588235
459751,5,6302409829,"FATHER OF THE BRIDE is a romantic comedy in a different vein. Most movies of that type are about a boy meeting a girl and the two falling in love. That happens in FATHER OF THE BRIDE. However, the movie isn't about the romantic love between a couple; it's about a father's love for his daughter.

It is true that the cast didn't have very difficult roles. Nevertheless, Steve Martin, Dianne Keaton, Kimberly Williams and the rest of the cast do a remarkable job, making the Banks family seem like real people you know instead of just some characters on a screen. Also, Martin Short, as the wedding coordinator, Franc, steals every scene he is in.

I enjoyed watching this film a lot. I laughed quite often and, even though I'm a bachelor, found myself crying during some scenes. The film is a family picture and for any man who has a daughter, ranks up with FIELD OF DREAMS for bringing a tear to your eye. It's a nice movie to bring the past into perspective, remind one of what really is important in life, and thank God for the blessings you have.",1032048000,2,1050,4.435233160621761

This what happens to George Banks (Steve Martin) - who has his own unique perspective on things, and his own loving fatherly logic that differs from everyone else's... This, or course, drives his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) crazy - since she's the 'sane' one in this relationship - who only wants a 'normal' wedding for her daughter...

459754,4,6302409829,"I'm usually not fond of remakes but this is another great exception. I can watch it over and over again and I have. It has a wonderful cast Steve Martin who is always gold and can always make you laugh, paired with the wonderfully talented Diane Keaton. Also with Martin Short and introducing Kimberly Williams as ""The Father of the Bride.""
It's an updated film version of the Liz Taylor's classic ""Father of the Bride.""
It's about a father having a hard time with letting his daughter go and trying to let her go and grow up, and all the hassels of putting together a wedding and then finding out what weddings are really about two people who are deeply in love joining together as a family.
The cast is incrediable and everyone in it is totally amazing. Of course the movie is basically a Fairy Tale type of wedding. I mean a middle class family and their daughter comes home engaged to a man who's family is very rich. It has its flaws but I don't think you'll care once you get into the richness of the movie and the comedy given by the actors and actresses.
I think everyone will love this what I want to call a classic remake put together by the lovely Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, and with my favorite movie musician Alan Silvestri. The movie can be a bit slow sometimes, but of course always picks itseslf back up. It's one of my favorites and I remember when I went to go see it at the theaters. Lovely remake of a film. And almost everyone will love it :) I can only dream of having a wedding like this!!
As for the DVD it's okay again your typical DVD I think. It's in widescreen edition and has a theatrical trailer, and Dolby Sound, French Language Track, and a Chapter Search. All in all pretty basic not even really Special Features section that I recall.
But as per ratings I would give the movie a B+ and a DVD a C+",1022112000,3,1835,4.29106628242075
459755,5,6302409829,"Though basically following the same plotline as Spencer Tracy's original classic of the same name, this remake, starring Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, and Kimberly Williams (who later went on to star in the top-rated, though short-lived WB series ""Felicity""), has a few significant differences from the original.
For instance, the role of the ""wedding coordinator"" (a caterer in the original version) played expertly, and to the hilt, by Martin Short, is given much more prominence here, making for some very zany, high octane moments which, if you saw this version first (as I did), are noticeably absent from Tracy's masterful, albeit slightly lower-key, version.
Putting it simply, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, but I leave with a word of caution to older viewers: If you watch this movie expecting to see the understatement and grace of Tracy revisited, you'll be disappointed.  However, if you, like me, are a child of the '70s and used to more kick in your humor, then this is the movie for you... and who knows?  It just might make you curious to see the original version--and open your eyes, as it did mine, to the fact that our grandparents knew something about love and relationships after all.",1008288000,,1219,4.884057971014493
459756,4,6302409829,"Father Of The Bride is a re-make of a 1950's film that starred Elizabeth Taylor and Spencer Tracy. This version stars Steve Martin as a father who can't let his little girl go when she announces that she's getting married. Her mom, elegantly played by Diane Keaton, is overjoyed. Dad, well, he doesn't know what to think. Kimberly Williams, as Annie the daughter, was a real find. She's pretty, cute, and talented. This is a role that Steve Martin seemed destined to play. He's such a brilliant comedian and comedic actor. He can play it straight just as well. He shines in this wonderful, warm, fuzzy comedy. Let's not forget Martin Short, as wedding coordinator Franc. Short is another comedy genius. He gives us an instantly memorable and classic performance. Just where exactly is Franc from?. Nobody really knows. The movie is incredible to look at. The town, the house, the car, the tree lined street. It's like the life and family one dreams of. It's a comedy winner. The sequel was just as good and sweet.

459787,3,6302409829,"Yes, George Banks, welcome to a world where your daughter is now 22, a college graduate ready to embark upon her career, and is annoucing to you she is engaged to be married.
Sounds like any father's immediate nightmare, right?
In this remake, Steve Martin takes on the role of the emotionally over-the-top dad who isn't quite ready to let his little girl go off and marry ""some ape"" who likes ""go-go boots and an apron.""  Because of Martin's great abilities for physical comedy and facial expression, the writers and director perhaps went on the extreme and let the logical side of things escape the story at times, but these slips in reasoning can be overlooked in the grand scheme of the film.  The most touching scenes involve the simplest actions, like when Mr. Banks is given the chance to get rid of his prospective son-in-law when the intended couple have a tift.  Also, Martin's straightforward voice-over narration adds greatly to his characterization.
This is a fun film, and is easily liked by many.  Martin Short as the wedding coordinator steals the show at times, and Oscar winner Diane Keaton knows how to put her foot down without playing the ""bad guy"" to Steve Martin's character.  Check out the bride's younger brother--a very young Kieran Culkin!
A lightweight film, but sometimes, that is precisely what you're looking for.  Keep this video around for just those moments.",992476800,,1392,4.877118644067797
459788,5,6302409829,"'Father of the Bride' was not ground-breaking. It was not revolutionary, and that is why I liked it. It was the kind of movie which you can sit with your family, or by yourself and thoroughly, truly, enjoy. It does not try and make you ponder the  Freudian positions on the methods of psychiatry...or ponder philosophical stand-points and views that we are one with the universe. It is a movie about relationships, and love, and how to let go. If a movie does not change society, it doesn't mean that it has no value at all, it means that it is a wonderful movie to help you let go, and understand what is really important in life. Which is rather ground breaking itself.",989625600,,671,4.455284552845528

The scene where the family meets the wedding coordinator is one of the many highlights.  The Hotdog bun episode, when Steve Martin meets Brian McKenzie, and the Banks-McKenzie meeting for that matter are all amusing as well.
Through all the laughter, it is very hard to let go of one's child even if its to a new spouse.  Steve Martin portrays that emotion with lots of humor and a little bit of sadness.  Its nice to see that the through it all, Kimberly Williams(the bride) shows that she is not a spoiled brat and does not expect the biggest wedding or wedding gifts.
