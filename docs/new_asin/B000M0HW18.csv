2718015,5,B000M0HW18,"I have been doing Advanced Pilates for about a year and a half (not Winsor, I HATED the Winsor Pilates series....boring) and I was looking for more of a challenge without buying an expensive reformer. This is the BEST. The sculpting ring engages your muscles even deeper than regular pilates...I am finding after doing this DVD for not even a month, I am looking even more toned, especially my legs. I am even incorporating the circle when I do my other Pilates routines. AND, you gotta LOVE that it is only 30 minutes long....I will sometimes do it twice when I am up to it.",1275436800,10,575,4.485714285714286

2718019,5,B000M0HW18,This Pilates workout is much like the Pilates you might know and do. But with the Sculpting Circle it makes the workout a bit harder and it shows off. You can both feel and see that you are doing a Pilates-workout on a higher level. It is good.,1397260800,4,244,4.104166666666667

2718022,4,B000M0HW18,"I have a lot of exercise equipment and added this in recently.  Very glad I did, as it is really unique.  Also got Mari Winsor's sculpting circle workouts (I am a big fan of hers) and those are great.  This little item challenged me and left me sore, in a good way.",1364688000,3,265,4.0576923076923075

2718025,5,B000M0HW18,"Before my review let me say please don't buy anything from Treasureshopper! She will rip you off so watch out!!!

She is extremely unprofessional. I gave her a very fair review and she lied and said I was unfair! What a liar! I have the email to prove that I was very truthful and very fair in my review. I really should have given her a 1, but I took into the factor of the product so I gave her a 3 which rated a fair.

The seller admitted to me that even though I paid for expedited service she intentionally sent it the cheaper route. She did credit me, but only because she got caught and I questioned it. I am going to file a former complaint as I don't feel it's fair to charge someone $5.10  for ""expedited"" service she only paid 2.65 to send it out!

So please buy this product, but please don't but from treasureshopper unless you want to be ripped off.

Now on to my review of the product.

I have been doing pilates with mat only through Winsor and I have loved that, but wanted something a little challenging. I would love to get a reformer, but they are pricy and take up a lot of space. I have heard good things about the ring so I thought I would get one, this workout and give it a try. I can not say enough about how much I love it. It kicks my butt  but in a good way!

Do make sure you get the kind of ring that's on the cover. I had intally gotten a  soft ring but it's hard to put in the postions to do the excerises. Getting the one like one the cover makes a great difference. Don't worry....they are about the same price.

I like the fact that it's roughly about 40 minutes too. By the end you really feel like you've had a totally body workout.

You will not go wrong with this DVD.",1296259200,18,1708,4.023668639053255
2718026,4,B000M0HW18,"I love pilates, esp with a sculpting ring. I have many of Mari Winsor's dvds. My two favorites are the ones which use the pilates ring. I do use a different,stronger sculpting circle. If you have back issues, pilates is a great way to stretch and strengten your back.",1292976000,3,267,4.469387755102041

8165557,4,B000M0HW18,looks fine on initial review.  i prefer the gym but suppose this will do when chicago temps dive and the snow keeps one in.  it does look a bit easy for those who are regular gym goers.  i will update with results when i am snowbound and cannot go to the gym for fear of becoming a snowball..literally!!!!!!!!!!!,1506643200,,312,4.344827586206897

8165561,3,B000M0HW18,"Nothing ground breaking. Your basic windsor pilates with a pilates circle. It does seem to help ab strength but I don't feel much in the way of legs/arms.
