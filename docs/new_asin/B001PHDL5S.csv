8333258,4,B001PHDL5S,"Prince Daaker AKA Captain Nemo has searched 20,000 leagues under the sea for revenge. The daughter of Prince Daaker (Lois Alexander) was abducted. Prof. Aronnax (Dan Hanlon) is invited by the US navy to track sown a sea monster that is interrupting shopping. He takes his daughter (Edna Pendleton). A balloon is blown off course and carries four men to the south pacific. An evil yacht owner looks for a girl from his past. All of these stories and the story of a Child of Nature in a chic leopard skin outfit will converge on a mysterious island for the final scenario.

We find this version of 20000 Leagues Under the Sea quite different from the Disney version. The special effects are more vantage and they spend more time explaining how the physics of the underwater suits, crystal ""magic window"", and underwater guns, work.

There are a few things that one must take in account for the times. Nemo looks like a goat herder. The giant octopus looks much more like the octopus in the John Wayne move Wake of the Red Witch. The underwater guns look like Winchester lever action. Where did the Child of Nature get her leopard skin? How did Nemo obtain his technology? Not the most plausible story.

There is also a long long under water filler scene. However there is excellent underwater photography by the brothers George and Ernest Williamson.

Other than that is fun to watch.",1506643200,,1382,4.698347107438017
8333259,4,B001PHDL5S,"If you are a die hard Jules Verne fan this is a must, however, remember this was made at the dawn of film making, so go in with an open mind. the film maker has taken many  liberties with the direction of the original story,  also it should be noted this is not as advertised the 1907 version of the film, it the later 1916 version. the earlier one is still unavailable. also this has been remastered from the original, the soundtrack music sounds different the picture quality could have been better, a full restoration should be undertaken on this film.",1238803200,2,555,4.485148514851486
