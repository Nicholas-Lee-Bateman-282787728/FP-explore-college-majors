2926865,4,B000UX6O3O,"This is a cool Thomas dvd. Lots of classic Thomas,and not much of the new version(which is cool!). Oddly, one story is about Thanksgiving,yet in the story they have Christmas music,Santa Claus cards,presents,etc. The songs are after all the stories. And the dvd repeats for you which is nice. I love the toy Thomas it came with. He's covered in snow!",1195344000,6,350,4.754098360655738

2926868,3,B000UX6O3O,This was a gift for my daughter. Has some repeat episodes from other DVDs but still is fun and liked.,1400976000,,101,4.1
2926869,3,B000UX6O3O,"My 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter loves Thomas and enjoys watching the episodes. However, I was disappointed in that there were two episodes right at the beginning, one, the original of Thomas and Percy's Christmas adventure that was re-scripted as ""Thanksgiving"" which they don't celebrate in Great Britain. The pictures the same, the story, altered. The later edition, now on YouTube, is much better. Then there was the Christmas episode that was called the ""winter holidays."" Not to my liking in the least. And there is no ""Santa Claus"" in GB, they have ""Father Christmas."" My disgust was so acute that we shut it off and watched ""BLUE MOUNTAIN MYSTERY,"" which is very good, indeed.",1390694400,,681,4.930434782608696

2926875,2,B000UX6O3O,"Oh well, I don't know if the description mentioned but it is the oldest version of Thomas. The cartoon is not animation. No wonder so cheap. :(",1361750400,4,143,4.333333333333333

2926881,1,B000UX6O3O,"My family was very disappointed in this DVD.  It was almost identical to another that we have, ""A Snowy Surprise,"" although it seemed to promise a new film.  In addition, after one playing, the disc snapped in half.",1340841600,,215,4.631578947368421

2926883,5,B000UX6O3O,I bought this one at Target for much less after being sorely disappointed in Merry Winter Wish... This one has excellent stories that my kids love!!! A great Christmas movie!!!,1292457600,16,176,4.9
2926884,4,B000UX6O3O,My 2 and 4 year old boys love Thomas the Tank.  They love watching the trains and saying all the different trains names.  There is a lot of snow and several Christmas episodes.,1230336000,2,176,4.303030303030303
2926885,1,B000UX6O3O,"The DVD content on this product is just fine.  Which is why I would recommend the edition without the ""collectible train"" if you plan to purchase soon and from Amazon directly.

The reason?  Somehow, and no one with Customer Service seems quite clear...the ""collectible train"" that is advertised at every other website online which features a snow-covered Thomas engine car:  is not.

I ordered this product twice, and each time it came with a plain old standard blue Thomas engine like the one my son has owned for years.  To make matters more confusing, the box was not factory sealed and the DVD case within the box was not either.  Nor was there any security tape along the edge of the DVD case and somehow lint had gotten under the disk onto the silver part.  Overall, it was a poorly thrown together effort at a ""collectible edition"".

That being said, I have no idea what third-party vendors are selling, and they may indeed have in their stock the correct train in a sealed box.  However, as a buyer beware...I would contact prior to purchase.

Amazon did say they would speak with their warehouse personnel to see if a ""bad batch"" was delivered to them for sale of which they were unaware, but in the meantime, the item I received in error twice is ALL THEY HAVE in stock.  Or so I was told.  In my case, Amazon made the situation right through other measures...but I felt I wanted to post for others so they could possibly avoid the frustration of returns during a busy season and/or having a very upset child on Christmas morning if this is being purchased as a gift.

In the event the product is changed to the correct one or goes out of print through Amazon proper, I will remove this review.  It isn't meant to disparge either Thomas the Train or Amazon.com...it is only to give a heads-up on what appears to be an on-going product error.  Please take it for the intent in which it was written.  It is much less expensive to simply buy the DVD without the train or check with a third-party seller to see if they have the correct train edition.  Not to mention less aggravating all-around. Even if I did eventually end up with the DVD through another seller and a refund, etc...  My son was distraught until the situation was rectified and I don't wish that on anyone else.

Happy hunting for the correct product.",1229385600,,2326,4.532374100719425

2926887,5,B000UX6O3O,"My 2 year old son LOVES this DVD. I was going to wait until Christmas eve to give it to him, but he loves Thomas and Friends so much I let him watch it.

8215536,5,B000UX6O3O,"My son ABSOLUTELY loves Thomas the Tank Engine. Everywhere we go, he sings the theme song. We had to take a five hour drive and have a portable dvd player that was gifted to my family and had no dvds.

8215542,2,B000UX6O3O,"Bought this thinking that it was just like the series that you see on TV, however, it wasn't. The character animation was very different from what you see on TV - in fact, there wasn't much animation at all. The narrator wasn't the same person as well. Very disappointed in the product, however, very happy with Amazon's response of refunding my money and not having to go through the hassle or returning the product.",1419638400,,417,4.648648648648648
