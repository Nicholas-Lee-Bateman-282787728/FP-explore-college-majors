6069055,5,B00GB0OSVU,"So glad this was available, took the grand kids to see the new movie which was great, then bought the original from you. They were glued to it!",1397865600,,143,4.142857142857143
6069056,3,B00GB0OSVU,I guess 60 minutes of Peabody & Sherman for $10 isn't bad. However I wish they had worked on the film to clean it up and brighten it like I've seen done with other cartoon sets. I found the pictures to be very grainy like they were just thrown on a DVD from an old VCR tape. The shows themselves brought back memories but the cartoons were shorter than I remembered.,1397347200,,366,4.169014084507042
6069057,5,B00GB0OSVU,I would give the content 5 stars however the episode description is wrong. The episodes listed on this website and on the back of the package are not the ones on the disc. These releases seem half assed but the episodes are will good so it works. I have volume 2 as well and I believe the episode lists are swapped between Vol. 1 and 2.,1396310400,,336,4.106060606060606
6069058,1,B00GB0OSVU,"The description for this DVD says:  Annie Oakley, James McNeil Whistler, The Texas Rangers, The Wright Brothers .... (see product description above).

The box itself says:  Annie Oakley, Calamity Jane, Daniel Boone and Paul Revere

But, the DVD (which is labeled ""Volume 1"", just like the box and the Amazon page, actually contains the following episodes:

Christopher Columbus
Captain Matthew Clift
Captain Kidd
Leif Ericsson
Ferdinand Magellan
Francisco Pizzaro
Marco Polo
Ponce de Leon
Vasco Nunez de Balboa
Zebulon Pike

I am not happy that the contents do not match up with the description

But I am really unhappy that when the DVD is first played, you are REQUIRED to watch a 2 minute 30 second commercial for the new (March 2014) theatrical release of Sherman & Peabody 3D movie.  You cannot fast forward, you cannot skip over.  Every time the DVD is installed, this commercial has to play.  Very irritating",1395878400,10,915,5.0
