8175624,4,B000N8V3YQ,"Filmed in 2002, this video from FlyingMonk Films starts off with the drive to Kailash, passing Saga, Zhongba and Paryang. The three-day Kailash kora is shown in detail, describing each of the major highlights like Darchen, Tarboche Pole, Chuku Gompa, Dirapuk, and the 5630 Dolma La, The images of Kailash are superb, including the south, west, and north faces. After Kailash they explore Lake Manasarovar. The introduction to the video has scenes from the major monasteries in Tibet - Sakya, Tashilhunpo in Shigatse, Gyantse's Kumbum and Pelkor Chode Monastery, and the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa.

The filming is very good, nice and slow, perfectly illustrating the vastness of the Tibetan plateau. The narration is well done, describing the sights very well. The descriptions of Buddhism and its symbols like prayer flags, prostration, statues and paintings are expertly explained.",1253059200,3,880,5.3768115942028984
