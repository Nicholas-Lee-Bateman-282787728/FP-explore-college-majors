3847752,5,B0024OW1QQ,"We have been mystery buffs for several years and this series kept us captivated with the multifaceted stories within each episode that were weaved together so well. The acting was first rate with an outstanding script and story line. This series should be adopted by the educational system in America to enlighten students on the realities of war on home soil and the effect it can have on the populace. It is refreshing to see the main character as a man of integrity who does not deviate in doing ""the right thing"" and showing degrees of mercy and understanding. It was quite evident that each story was well-thought out and filmed with a great cast and production staff.  This series from Amazon was obtained at an excellent cost and well-worth every penny.",1257292800,6,760,4.757575757575758
3847753,5,B0024OW1QQ,"this is a great series. i just started watching the dvds,#1 and #2 so far and am absolutely sold. the film  literally takes you back to 1940 england.. the casting is absolutely convincing and the sense of england with its back to the wallis real. if you like mysteries, great acting and convincing scenes..get this series.  well worth the money and highly recommended.",1254528000,2,368,4.825396825396825
3847754,5,B0024OW1QQ,"As has been said by others, I would give this series more stars it I could - it's that good.  Brilliantly written, acted and executed, the strengths of this show are historical accuracy, attention to detail and meticulous scripts.  Michael Kitchen can convey more in the twitch of his jaw than most actors can express in an entire soliloquy.  He's truly amazing and I can't say enough about the performances of Anthony Howell and Honeysuckle Weeks.  Add to that a parade of A-list British actors and you have a series that is well worth every penny you pay for this complete collection.",1251590400,8,586,4.715686274509804
3847755,5,B0024OW1QQ,"If you like historical fiction, Foyle's War is for you. Great writing, intriguing plots, excellent actors, and absolute authenticity--you simply can't ask for more. The first series is a bit slow, the solutions to the murders a tad too obvious, but bear with it. By the second series, the plots increase in complexity. What I liked best about Foyle's War was that it was not your usual WWII fare. Each episode was thoughtful, insightful and rich in emotional depth. The realism with which the British war experience was portrayed was astonishing, and the characters were so well developed they truly came alive. By the end of the series, the laconic Foyle will have become a member of your family (along with the irrepressible Sam). My only complaint is that there weren't a hundred more episodes. I could have watched Foyle forever.",1250985600,15,833,4.914893617021277
3847756,5,B0024OW1QQ,"""FOYLE'S WAR: Sets 1-5"" presents British Home Front war-life through poignant topics, compelling suspense, and many mirthful moments. Masterpiece Theatre created a 6-year running (2002-2008) British mystery masterpiece.  They outdid themselves. This ""War Years"" series of 19 feature-length episodes is now available as a set and thus a better price. Wow, 32 hours, of sure-to-please mystery/period drama.

It is a 1940-45 Southern England countryside experience not to be missed.  It serves as a home-front view documentary of the English WWII involvement and resulting life-style of the population away from the active war front. This series begins in May, 1940 when all England expects an eminent invasion from Germany. You'll learn lots about the British WW2 home-war preparedness.

On the other hand, FOYLE'S WAR is a series of some of the best 21st century written murder mystery stories ever presented on television--or theater. An interview bonus feature with creator/writer Anthony Horowitz proves that the dual focus--mystery/period drama--was intentional from day one.  The combined perfection is ""jolly good show.""  It's hard to believe--but, 19 episodes comprising 32 hours is simply not enough of ""Foyle's War.""  You'll want to move from #1 through to #19 without stopping to sleep. It's that good.

Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a cop who'd rather be on the war front than investigating crime in Hastings, England.  His cases, almost always murder, are quite involved, and never fail to end with a surprise--or two.  I'll stick my neck out--Foyle's as good as Poirot.  Foyle recruits help from an ex-soldier who lost a leg. Milner (Anthony Howell) manages to do much of Foyle's ""leg-work"" on an artificial limb.

Foyle is assigned a female driver, ""Sam"" for Samantha Stewart. She's a gorgeous red-head with a winning, million-dollar smile.  Sam is as much fun watching in the series as her real name indicates--Honeysuckle Weeks (The Rag Nymph; Catherine Cookson book/movie classic, recommended!) She wins ""Miss Congeniality"" of the 1940s decade.

Perfect attention is given to the period details; sets, costumes, vehicles, architecture, even down to  NO yellow road lines.
Both Foyle and Sam speak volumes of dialogue with nothing but facial expressions. Their performances are nothing short of superb. Perfection.

Additional guest cast members of each episode are well-known stars in their own right--following the tradition of some of the top Masterpiece Theatre productions. It is understood that Foyle will continue in a NEW post-war mystery suspense scheduled for perhaps a 2010 airing.
Closed Captioning provides for the hearing impaired and those of us who struggle with some British accents and slang.  The set has cast filmographies on all the top regular and guest stars.

""FOYLE'S WAR"" is to British mystery what ""THE PALLISERS"" is to British political drama, OR what ""MONARCH OF THE GLEN"" is to Scottish Highland drama. After you've experienced Foyle's War, I recommend either of the other 2 series.

3847757,5,B0024OW1QQ,"Michael Kitchen. Never heard of him, I'm sure, you're saying. That would be your loss, especially if you enjoy a great period piece now and then. Kitchen was marvelous as the British agent for a British landlord with holdings in 19th century Ireland, in ""The Hanging Gale."" And now Kitchen triumphs again as a detective chief superintendent Christopher Foyle. He often identifies himself, however, rather more charmingly: ""My name is Foyle. I'm a police officer."" No badge is shown or papers presented while so introducing himself. Such would be superfluous though as Kitchen's Foyle, in mannerisms, demeanor, as well as the way his carries himself, makes it rather apparent that he is in law enforcement. And to boot, all this takes place in the early days of 1940, ""in the beautiful southern English countryside amid the disorder and danger of World War II""(to quote the packaging). The episodes herein ""concentrate on the influence the war had on the home front.""

As in all Foyle episodes a murder takes place and Kitchen methodically goes about solving it. He has a sergeant for assistance as well as an actress side-kick (whose most unusual name in real life is Honeysuckle Weeks) who plays an army soldier seconded to drive for Foyle, who is without a license to do so. Like in many detective dramas the who did it is rather less important than the drama getting to that point. Actually, these hour and forty minute long Foyle episodes often go by for me without my giving much serious contemplation toward the solution Foyle seeks. Ever play chess and really focus on 3, 4, 5, 6 possible moves in advance and then play a casual game of chess just for fun? That's how I personally watch Foyle's War. I'm not too interested in guessing then second guessing again & again who I think is the murderer. (I do do that often with David Suchet's Hercule Poirot Agatha Christie mystery dramas, but alas, do too much guessing wrong there, however.) Watching Foyle is also much a period drama, as I've said, giving one a feel for 1939-1940 England, the country lanes, the occasional military vehicle and soldier(s), authentic clothes, hats, people on missions greater than themselves passing through the lens.

""A lesson in murder"" is what a character terms war in an episode of this series. The episode balances the views of conscientious objectors with the need to contribute to a cause thought noble and just by most. An interesting angle of the Foyle series is the notion that the rule of law remains central even in a time of great moral stress; not in the sense of civil liberties ala Lincoln in the US Civil War, but in the sense that a murder is a murder whether a country is at war or not and such a crime out result in punishment. In this first episode, for example, a military man tries to reason with Foyle that taking him away from the invaluable work he was doing, leading a team trying to combat Nazi Germany, would serve no end, certainly no greater good. Foyle's driver later asks him whether he was tempted to let the man go, so to speak; give him a pass because of the circumstances Britain found itself in at the moment. Yes, Foyle, answered, in so many words. Nevertheless, we see the man in question being soon dealt with showing that Foyle's sympathies, war reason, didn't get the best of him in the end. Such evinces the quality of this series---sympathies for varied viewpoints are shown, but in the end much of which most could seen as right, is followed through on....thanks to the able Michael Kitchen. Kitchen, moreover, is an actor who is most accomplished even when not saying anything. Words are not thrown about in this series. In one episode (I won't say which as it will give away a bit of one story) Honeysuckle Weeks character Sam admits to Foyle that she doesn't know what to say after an unfortunate tragedy. To which Foyle responds: ""I don't know what to say either."" It's the epitome of Michael Kitchen's performance in this series---knowing what to say when words are warranted and saying little or nothing when they are not. Cheers",1249862400,85,4071,4.716292134831461
3847758,5,B0024OW1QQ,"Nobody does period pieces like the British, and Foyle's War may be the best of them all.  The setting of Hastings in Britain during WWII is the basis for important war related themes in addition to the whodunnits of each episode.  Americans have no idea what wartime living was like compared to what the British experienced, and this nineteen episode series brings it to incredible reality.  Michael Kitchen (Detective Chief Supt Foyle,) Honeysuckle Weeks (Samantha Stewart,) and Anthony Howell (Sgt. Milner) are impossibly good in their roles.  Other fine actors drop in and out of the series and are spot on, as they might say.  The research done for this series seems to have left no stone unturned when it comes to themes, settings, costumes, you name it.  The good news: there is a sixth series coming with the same main characters, but in the post-war period.",1248652800,53,865,4.850340136054422

The series is set during and after the Second World War in Hastings, England, with Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) against criminals and often against politicians and other big-wigs in the government and the military. Foyle tries to do what is right and not let national security used as an excuse for officials and/or criminals to use the confusion of war to their advantage.

She surprises us with many talents, from first aid, mechanics, knack with children, willingness to go ""undercover"" a couple times.  The hardships faced by the population in England though this war period is demonstrated in many overt and subtle ways, from badly injured soldiers and airmen, to the constant challenge of finding enough to eat.",1391644800,,641,4.94392523364486

3847788,5,B0024OW1QQ,"WWII is an excellent background for mystery writer in London England.  He did his research and Kitchen was a superb actor who made the mystery even better.  I was a child when this went on and lived in a seaside town in New Jersey.  I saw all the trucks driving down Atlantic Avenue to get to the road leading to the docks where they were to ship out overseas.  We had practice air raid warnings and when we went to the movies and saw the people walking along the road escaping their town it was very frightening even in New Jersey.  So, I very much enjoy his series.  However, looking at live footage of London after the blitz hit is too awful.  The bit shown in these stories does not show the horror as it actually looked.  the bombs flattened buildings altogether.  But, his movies are good for it does create a desire to research the actual events.

That quality is rarely seen in modern society. Men like Foyle command respect, without ever demanding it.  The other stand-out point about this show is the cinematography.  Much is filmed in the British countryside, not much in studio. I am amazed that it is written by one man, Anthony Horowitz, as I recall. His knowledge of a time 70 years passed is beyond impressive. The supporting cast is excellent too. Highly recommended.",1368403200,,579,4.948453608247423

I love all of the characters, and I love learning about what it was like living in the UK during WW2. My only complaint is I wish there were more movies! They left some rather large time gaps in the period from 1941 through 1944 - maybe they can make some new episodes and fill in these gaps!",1368316800,,467,4.258426966292135

Michael Kitchen  is the master of conveying an incredible breadth of emotion/attitude with the nuances of his countenance and very few words.  The female supporting character is uniquely interesting -- innocent, decent, adventurous, not especially pretty but attractive, and a little obnoxious.

3847838,5,B0024OW1QQ,"We received this series. Horowitz who wrote the scripts for the BBC production is easily familar with the English experience in World War 2. The tension in war time, the story of chaos and crime and the ""Invasion"" of the Yanks and the role of spies create an arresting set of facts that are woven into the scripts for each episode. There are generally 3 sub-plots that fram the 100 minutes. There are times when the sub-plots overlap and become part of the larger plot, revealed at the end.
The story is tied together with Michael Kitchen's DS Foyle and his driver Sam, Samantha. His sgt. brings a dimension to the episodes of each script.
I find this series more satisfying than Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, etc. I enjoy the latter but find the Foyle character intriguing and low key but highly level observer. Furthermore, Foyle does not mind challenging authority figures - army, the constabulary, and others of pretense.",1359244800,,925,4.7875

The principal actor is intelligent, sympathic, but so introvert, and that's why I think that serie is not that good that it would be. In comparison, I LOVED so much Cracker with Robbie Coltrane, which is a real colorful character. The good point of this serie is the decor : absolutely realistic! Last point, the intrigue is nicely tied up because we can't never be sure who's the culprit.  Over all, I recommand that serie. Bravo!",1359072000,,570,4.7

3847857,4,B0024OW1QQ,"This series is about a reluctant police officer who solves crimes in the English countryside along the coast, during the WWII years. Foyle wants to fight in the war, but is trapped in his role as DCS.  Gradually he comes to accept his fate, as the characters around him grow to depend upon him - his sergeant and his driver.  Both blossom under his quiet leadership.  Kitchen shines as the understated DCS Foyle, but the supporting cast of Howell (Sgt Milner) and Weeks (Sam Stewart) sometimes steals the show.  Weeks plays a woefully misplaced mechanic who is rescued by Foyle's need for a driver.  She's the very definition of sweetness and I had a terrible crush on her when the show first aired.  Howell plays a wounded vet who rediscovers his purposefulness in life on the police force as the loyal and capable Sergeant Milner.  The stories are as much about the history of England and the trials of the people who lived during the period as it is about the mysteries that Foyle must solve.  That is what makes this police drama special.
Update: there may be some confusion about this set and season 7.  Set 4 includes seasons 4 and 5, while set 5 covers the three episodes from season 6. Season 7 is not included.",1356739200,,1219,4.555045871559633

Only to say that for me it is the moral integrity of this series that I believe lifts it above many others.
The ethical position of Foyle is impeccable. Despite his character being a man of few words type, his dedication to truth, but above that compassion, shines through in each episode.  I can't tell the many times his lines have given me goose bumps due to his goodness.  The writer Anthony Horowitz has done a brilliant job both on the ethical front, but also with intricate and detailed Agatha Christie like plots.  All the characters are extremely well done.  And too I deeply appreciate the avoidance of overly done violence, despite it being a show full of murders.  Morse and Lewis series are a little too bloody for my taste.  For it is my ideal not to show such things, it behooves good taste, which is rare these days.
I give it my highest recommendation.",1356739200,,1060,4.6063829787234045

Michael Kitchen's portrayal of Foyle is amazing. And the cast, locations, sets, and stories will have you completely enthralled from beginning to end. You will miss Hastings when the credits roll and hasten to pop in another DVD all too quickly just to return. You'll soon find out how important such things as an onion can be!

 Horowitz delivers a feature film style episode every time. He was recognized by BAFTA in 2010 for this fantastic effort.

The only tragedy is when you come to the end of the series and want more. There are a few more episodes and they still are not enough for me. I only hope the cast, BBC,

Times are tougher now for TV drama and the ""golden age"" cliche stll holds good; but there are a handful of shining exceptions and one is Foyle's War.  Writers, director and cast have come together to produce powerful drama which captures an era of UK history which is fast vanishing from memory.  We are bombarded with historic films and documentaries about the military part of the war, but FW shows us what it was like on ""the home front"" with rationing, bombing scares, spy scares.  But life went on, with BBC radio, church services, cricket games and 3Rs being taught in the schools.  Pubs also in full swing despite watered down beer.

One of the things I loved most about this entire series was how it showed aspects of war-torn England that is not often depicted. Such as the intense fear of Germany's invasion on England soil, the removal of all road and rail signs (to delay the German's progress should they invade), the rescue at Dunkirk, and so much more. I feel like I got a huge history lesson even while watching a highly captivating detective series. And the stories themselves were rivetting! Michael Kitchen IS DCS Christpher Foyle forever, as far as I'm concerned. Some of the episodes (which are movie-length themselves) deal with mature themes (affairs, out of wedlock pregnancies, lots of pre-marital relation (only ever refered to, never actually seen), one episode reveals a homosexual but it is not a lasting theme, season 4 shows two ppl waking up in bed (NOT key characters), and she is obviously naked, seen from the side waste up, although nothing highly critical is shown, etc,etc).

3847883,5,B0024OW1QQ,"Foyle's War is superb in all respects: scripts, cinematograpy and themes historically acurate for the period.

As I viewed the series, I became immediately aware that the themes\issues portrayed are universal, not tied to any time period or even country.

War brings out the worst and best in people. The best qualities: courage, love of country, selflessness. The worst qualities: stereotyping of the enemy, violence against any race or group linked to the enemy, the paranoia stemming from fear.

In one episode, an Italian restrurant owner is burned alive in his apartment over his restrurant by a mob (most of whom have been his friends and customers before Italy entered the war against England). Throughout the series the military is willing to consider any means to defeat the enemy including the use of chemical and biological weapons. One character asks, ""If we do these kinds of things, are we any better than the enemy?"" The frightened people of the UK are willing to happily sacrifice their civil liberties in the name of security.

Today we are still grappling with these question. Wars take many different forms today. The series reminded me that the so-called ""Patriot Act"" has led us Americans in the post 9\11 era to sacrifice civil liberties to defeat terrorism. All people of Arab derivation (including those who are seperated by generations from their immigrant ancestors)are subjected to abuse and too often to physical violence. We tend to paint all perceived enemies with a broad stereotyping brush.

I grew up during the ""Cold War."" As a child, I remember being terified by ""duck and cover"" drills. We were all certain we could be ""nuked"" by the commies at any minute. Such fear gave rise to McCarthyism. My father was the superintendent of a small rural school in the Missouri Ozarks, not an area which was likely to be a target for rampant communist subversion. My father got into trouble and was investigated when he refused, on principle, to sign a loyalty oath. Witch-hunts and blacklists swept the U.S. up into a cloud of paranoia. Now we have the ""War on Terrorism"" and requests for more restrains on personal liberties to win it. Are we going to repeat the same mistakes? We never seem to learn from history. These same fears and excesses brought Hitler to power. How many liberties are we willing to conceede in order to have ""security""?

War also promotes greed in many. There are always those who use war to get rich. Foyle has to deal with the profeiteers and so do we; those who's only concern is to use the fog of war to enhance their own wealth and power.

Foyle's War brilliantly deals with all the issues and behaviors that are attendant to war. The actors are superb; especially Kitchen (as Foyle) and Honeysuckle Weeks (as his assistant).

The scripts are beautifully written and just as brilliantly acted.

This series is vastly superior to the wretched ""reality series"" and bad talent shows that have virtually taken over U.S. television.

Order some British tv series and discover a whole new world.",1343001600,4,3045,4.872340425531915

But what drives this series without a doubt is Michael Kitchen (ironically a man who doesn't drive).  Though he never runs off at the mouth, everything he says is important as he steadily moves in on his target.  It is a joy to try to follow the direction of his mind even whan he is not sure about his case.

Not only does Foyle's struggle to fight the war of crime, but he is immersed and surrounded in the mire of the war in which his country finds itself and how it affects the humans who endure it cruelties.

From the early onset of the series, the difficulties and heartaches of war are clearly focused upon and not glossed over. The episodes are wonderfully crafted, as well as the interwoven stories of a different kind of war -- that is one of a personal nature where one kills a single human not for king and country, but for personal gain, greed, and pure hatred. Foyle is by all means the ultimate man with the stiff upper lip mentality. He says very little, you can be assured, unless it's necessary to say. The remainder of the time he ponders, deducts, and keeps a tight lip on his own emotions, though his facial expressions and body language reveal his every thought.

You will be captivated by the personalities of Christopher Foyle, Samantha Stewart, and Paul Milner. Their relationships with one another develop throughout the series, and they behave as real people would (with very human shortcomings) rather than as stereotypical ""murder mystery"" personae. Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle's gently subdued but oh-so-effective method of interrogation is delight to watch. The stories are nothing special in themselves, I suppose, but Anthony Horowitz's idea to set them in the context of the Second World War adds a dimension which makes them infinitely more intriguing.

3847896,4,B0024OW1QQ,"Since there doesn't seem to be a box set for ALL the Foyle's War series, I suppose I'll write my review here (I've seen all 7 seasons, ""7"" if you count the two short seasons separately).  There are MANY good things about this series, most of them amply enumerated by other reviews.  I, myself, was thoroughly engrossed by Seasons 1 and 2, eating up a new show each night (at 100 minutes each, no mean feat on successive work nights!).  As I was watching, Foyle (the detective) reminded me somewhat of Detective Columbo - no histrionics, very understated, taking that extra look that seems to bore right through you, and basically talking and observing (both human behaviour and the physical evidence) his way to the perpetrator.  The plotting of the stories is very different - with Foyle you do not know who the perpetrator is until it's revealed by Foyle, and sometimes the story ""cheats"" in that it doesn't give you all the information you need to solve it at home (a key name is withheld or a conversation unheard), but in both series the result isn't the point - it's the interaction between the characters, centred on the strong central performance by the lead.

In another way Foyle is much like Columbo - they are both routinely underestimated by their criminal opponents.  It's a truism in historical fiction (look no further than Arthur Conan Doyle) that police officers were dim, brutish, and of the lower classes.  Certainly, in one episode we meet an old girlfriend of Foyle whose gentried father objected to their pairing because of his ""low station"" as a police officer.  Again - it is presumed that anyone with any competence would have been called up by the military in WWII, thus Foyle must be the dregs to still be holding a position in civilian law enforcement (as opposed to his limping lieutenant, shot up in Norway and discharged on medical grounds, an ""honourable"" reason to be in civilian clothing).

The series progresses through the war hitting its major highlights, with the mystery of the week involving some central aspect of the war.  For example, there is a show involving D-day, a couple centred on the Battle of Britain (Foyle's son Andrew is a Spitfire pilot), etc.  Interestingly, many of the crimes represent a seedy side of humanity - a base commander who rapes his female orderlies and has it covered up because he's ""vital"" to the war effort, an industrialist making deals with the Nazis in anticipation of the invasion, etc. - in direct contrast to the romantic vision of the good and stoic Islander facing off the Nazi threat.  Unfortunately, in later seasons the series takes on a sameness that is a little grating (perhaps only because I watched the shows so closely together - but then, that's why you buy a DVD set).  EACH mystery involves a central event of the war.  There are multiple times when Andrew is involved (a murder on his base, a murder of a childhood friend) and even more involving Foyle's driver Samantha (Sam's roomate is murdered, her flat is bombed, her boss is under suspicion of murder (twice!), etc.).  It becomes almost ludicrous the convolutions the show goes through in order to involve Sam in the later seasons when she is no longer with the Police Department.  In addition, many of the shows are intricately plotted, but to the point where an extremely unlikely coincidence is required to bring it all together at the end (this isn't a problem with any individual show, but you start to notice it when you watch them all closely together).

Perhaps this is being nitpicky - part of the show's charm (like Columbo) is the way it sticks to the formula, how an inter-related series of events eventually traps the bad guy, and the calm unruffled centre of Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle.  I especially loved the contrast between this show and a typical American-style crime show as demonstrated in the episode ""Invasion"".  The show's title does not refer to D-day or an impending Nazi landing, but to the arrival of American troops in England.  It's made quite clear that some people clearly would have preferred the Nazis (who, after all, were seen by many to be simply ""Germans"" - from the civilized land of Beethoven, Goethe, and Schopenhauer - and not loud-mouthed colonial rabble like the Yanks).  This kind of low-key humour (satire?) runs through the series, which gives it a modernist slant that would have been lost on the contemporaries, but that gives the show a resonance that cuts through the years.",1332028800,,4487,4.793774319066148

I wanted to get my father, who served in WWII, the dvds for his birthday.  He loves them as much, or even more, than we do. They are a great blend of history and entertainment. Since I was born a couple of decades after WWII and my understanding of it is solely through the lens of history and since I knew the final outcome, I never really grasped how real the possibility was that Hitler might actually invade England, even conquer the whole world. I was fascinated by such things as the British taking down all their street signs so that when the Germans invaded they would have a harder time getting around.  Foyle's War is well known for its historical research and accuracy. It is a great series for any history buff, or any mystery buff for that matter.

One comment on the purchase.  It was much cheaper to buy the whole 5-series collection. I had purchased Series 1 for us and Series 3 for my father. When I started looking around to get him a couple more series, I ended up purchasing the whole collection of 5 series cheaper than I could buy two individual series.

Based on the customer reviews I expected excellent writing, thoughtful, meticulous, carefully plotted mysteries, wonderful sets, and superlative acting.  The acting and the historical sets are, indeed, wonderful.  The writing, however, is third rate and the mysteries are both predictable and preposterous.  There are far too many unbelievable coincidences, the motivations of the characters are often psychologically unconvincing--and Foyle's sure conclusions are often based on extremely flimsy evidence.  Most annoying is that, in every one of the episodes I've seen, the criminal conveniently confesses when faced with that flimsy evidence. These confessions reminded us both of Kojack episodes ""Yes, Yes, I murdered the bastard!!"".  Often, I found myself rewriting the episodes in my head (at night when I should be sleeping)--if only they had added a particular nuance, added a pivotal character, traced out Foyle's reasoning-and most of all--created some real evidence.  A good mystery leaves you satisfied. Loose ends are tied up.  Order is restored.  These stories are terribly unsatisfying. Moreover, we have always been able to guess who the murderer is considerably in advance because of  of hackneyed plot devices, cartoonish characters, and that well known BBC political correctness--which I usually find kind of reassurring and cosy--but here is just tedious. Michael Kitchen is wasted on this material.  His face is so eloquent and he is such an intelligent actor that he often, almost, is able to fill in what the writers leave out.  But not sufficiently.  By the 4th episode, Foyle, despite the best efforts of the actor, was beginning to seem smug and less interesting.  Its really too bad.  Maybe I have been spoiled by the truely excellent series we have watched. The Wire, Slings and Arrows, Treme, and lately, Game of Thrones.  It just seems that if you are going to spend the money on amazing sets--why not pony up for real writers.  With the Wire we see what some of our best novelists can do when they work on a series. The creator of Foyle's War should never have been allowed to think that he could write mysteries.",1325635200,11,2238,5.157894736842105

Wartime social and political issues intertwine with the police work and personal lives of the characters. Series creator and writer Anthony Horowitz scripted compelling stories, historic scenes, realistic dialogue, and very believable personalities. A terrific crew and cast, including the amazing but underrated actor Michael Kitchen, bring Horowitz's stories and personalities to life.

I enjoy entertainment that requires thinking and the dilemmas of wartime justice were fascinating: What do you do when the criminal is playing a major role in the war? The characters were believable and well acted although, probably due to the constraints of time and budget, Foyle seems to magically put all the clues together near the end to solve the mystery.

It is very encouraging to know that there is a place to go (The British film industry) to get an intelligent, well acted, mystery series.  It is unfortunate that the United States cannot have a mystery series without the zombies, vampires, tons of sex, the obligatory road chase, or a script that sounds like it was written by 16-year-old.  There are very few exceptions, the Jesse Stone series is one.

Foley's war is an outstanding mystery series, very engaging, and with a refreshing variety and excellent actors.

Michael Kitchen is brilliant, as is expected, and his dry, unaffected humor always pops up when you need it most; with a simple wink or a curl of the lip. The man's a fantastic actor and has this part down pat. I can't conceive of anyone else ""being"" Foyle-the police officer.

I saw the first four Foyle's War episodes on a friend's Sony XBR and Sony BluRay player and the quality was very good. That, plus the fact that everything about the acting, directing, production, etc., of this exceptional series appealed to me so strongly that I ordered the Series 1 - 5 set through an Amazon Seller immediately.

At home, I have an excellent Panasonic G15, connected to two different DVD players. Because the Foyle's War series DVDs are not BluRay, I played the first three episodes on my equally excellent Denon ""standard"" format DVD player. Oddly, Episode 1 looked just fine, but Episodes 2 and 3 looked faded and ""washed-out"".  Then I switched over to my Panasonic BluRay DVD player and played all three of the these episodes.  On the BluRay player, all three looked just fine, fully focused, and with good color saturation.

But on a purely technical note,  I have noticed that some people are having trouble accessing the ""closed captioning"" feature. It is NOT on the discs themselves.

Here everyone was worried about the possible loss of beloved men fighting in Europe, but the actual casualty when it occurred was that of the new young wife of a soldier.  Folye's war makes it clear that no one really escaped hurt and loss.  What makes these mysteries more captivating is the stolid insistence of the central character that justice is owed to the victims of crimes and their families, even in time of war.  No one, even an important figure in the war effort, is above the law, and more importantly no one, even an enemy POW, is beneath the law.  Inspector Foyle is the personification of the sane rule of law working in the midst of an insane and lawless world.  He is like a knight who refuses to give up his cause, even if it appears lost.  As he notes in more than one episode and in more than one way, if you suspend the rules of the law of the land because of the war, you are no better than the enemy with whom you are fighting it.",1274659200,2,1411,4.793388429752066

The uncontrived interweaving of multiple story lines that connect in each episode is only one of the show's many stellar qualities.

The period look is spectacular. The viewer has no difficulty transporting himself to the village of Hastings at the beginnings of World War II. DCI Foyle and his very believable crew solve civilian crime in the tapestry of 1940's small village English life and WW II. The characters are believable, although some of the Cockney dialect is difficult to follow. The viewer will have a breathtaking view of the southeast English coast, be involved in good mysteries, join with believable and memorable characters and receive a good look at the English during WW II. This is the best series I have seen...and there are more episodes to come.",1271980800,,984,5.042944785276074
3847957,5,B0024OW1QQ,"Another excellent British television production.  Michael Kitchen is just excellent in this series.  He embodies just the right mix of compassion and no-nonsense efficiency.  The backdrop of WWII is skilfully integrated into the storyline and makes it much more interesting by injecting murky moral and ethical dilemmas not neatly dispatched at the end of each episodes.  Some of the scenes are just searing - the scene in one of the earlier episodes where a father asks Foyle to let his son (David Lane) out of police custody so that they can go and rescue their boys from Dunkirk and promises to bring him back is absolutely remarkable in capturing the competing interests of the father, the war effort and the law. Resist the temptation of watching all of the series back to back; stretch out the viewing and let each episode linger and fully bloom; I promise you, it is so much more than a murder mystery.",1271548800,,909,4.770700636942675
3847958,5,B0024OW1QQ,"We were extremely pleased with the set of Foyle's war. They are in perfect condition, and we received them in a very short time.
 We are so pleased we are looking to buy the complete series 1-15 of Midsomer Murders.",1270512000,,215,4.375
3847959,5,B0024OW1QQ,I missed this series of PBS.  I was visiting a friend and she had the series.  When I got home I ordered it immediately -- I am hooked!,1268870400,,135,3.7857142857142856
3847960,5,B0024OW1QQ,"Wow!  After obsessing on Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, Dorothy Sayres, Dashiel Hammett, Rex Stout, even Sir Arthur, you might think that the well is dry for great mystery detective fiction.  However, author Anthony Horowitz is somewhat of a versatile genius, minus an extra red herring or two, when it comes to screenplay and plot.  He more than holds his own against the best of the genre and gives you an historic backdrop that makes ""Foyle's War"" qualify as WWII ""Mystery History.""  If you don't enjoy these, then you need to buy more potato chips to go with your TV dinners.  Painstakingly accurate, lavish cinematography, great costumes, first rate acting, etc.  what the hey!!!  Poirot eat your heart out.  Foyle is a short (actor Michael Kitchen), principled kind of guy, but has a stubborn, subdued charm whose actions do more to win the Battle of Britain than all the limeys combined.",1268611200,,898,4.94
3847961,5,B0024OW1QQ,"I bought this for my husband because he enjoys World War II history. This show is interesting, thought provoking and very accurate for the time period it is depicting. I didn't think I would watch them, but have and am enjoying them as much as he is.

I would highly recommend these shows to anyone who enjoys mysteries and/or World War II period shows.",1266710400,,353,4.515625
3847962,5,B0024OW1QQ,"This series is spectacularly well-researched, accurately portrayed, and acted and presented with a sensitivity and human-ness which is almost beyond words to describe. I would recommend it to anyone, and whole-heartedly. It is, truly, an excellent peice of work from beginning to end.",1266710400,,284,5.627906976744186
3847963,5,B0024OW1QQ,"I have now watched series 1-5 four times so perhaps that is some testimony to its value. The mysteries, period, accuracy, quality of acting, and pace all are so appealing that it is watchable time and again. Michael Kitchen is an incredibly engaging actor and though his portrayal of the title character provides a linear storyline (as does the war) all of the supporting characters are equally brilliant. One of the most endearing aspects of the series is how each can be watched alone or in order. Solving murders in a time of war is both ironic and necessary - and it makes for great viewing.",1266624000,,595,4.622641509433962
3847964,5,B0024OW1QQ,"This series about the home front in England during WWI is a subject with which I was not familiar. Each mystery episode can stand alone even though there are also continuing stories of the characters intertwined and separate from the action.  The attention to detail and extraordinary acting make this a ""must see.""  You will find yourself wishing it would never end.  It has a patina that is unusually distinctive.",1266451200,2,415,4.9
3847965,5,B0024OW1QQ,This has been a wonderful series.  The stories are well written and acted out with great precision.  You really get to know the characters and just can't wait for the next show.  I got this for my father who is a very avid reader of mysteries.  He usually reads a book or 2 a week.  We spend lots of time going back and forth to the library.  I was telling my friends about my recent purchase of the Thin Man series and one of my friends told me about Foyle's war.  It has just been great.  My dad get my mom and me together after dinner and he say please put the next one on.  We have been doing this for a few weeks.  I highly recommend this series for pure enjoyment and for the ingenuity in how the crimes are solved.  Lot's of fun and it really keeps you riveted to the show until it is over.  Highly recommended!,1265846400,,818,4.04375
3847966,5,B0024OW1QQ,"What makes this series five star for us is: the heart warming story line, character development, detailed period setting and costuming, and truly terrific acting. Each of the  19 episodes grapples with the mystery to be solved.  But there are also nuanced themes of decisions in time of war, ethics, and poignant moments revealing WWII from the Brit's perspective. We had to ration ourselves to one episode a week or we'd have gone through them within the week.",1265414400,,461,4.897435897435898
3847967,5,B0024OW1QQ,"A great series and my wife and I did not want it to end.

We parceled our watching out to once a week-to make sure it did not end too soon.

The series tackled the underside of the war effort and the home front shenanigans that went on.

Michael Kitchen became my new definer of ENGLISH UNDERSTATEMENT!

gREAT SERIES.

3847968,5,B0024OW1QQ,A friend and I watched the complete series while I was at her place in Texas and loved the all of the stories.  What made it even better was my friend is from London and she and her family would go to Hastings to spend holidays at the beach!  She also grew up during the war and remembers some of the things that went on with the children as she was a little girl herself.  Fabulous series!!!,1264982400,,392,4.064935064935065
3847969,5,B0024OW1QQ,I bought the series as a Christmas present for my friend last year and I was hooked after watching the first story with him!  It's about life in a small town in England during WWII and the adventures of Detective Foyle.  I have since given additional sets of the complete series or parts of it to friends and relatives who are history-oriented. Everyone who has seen this series has raved about how wonderful it is!,1264291200,,415,4.52
3847970,5,B0024OW1QQ,"One of the best shows that has ever been shown on television. Inspector Foyle is in a difficult time period during WWII. He continues to do his job with dignity and grace. The scenery is great, the stories are spell binding and the roll of Foyle is played superbly by Mr. Keaton!",1264291200,,279,4.384615384615385
3847971,4,B0024OW1QQ,"Great period piece!  Very well done on what must have been a limited budget.  Cinematography, scenery, sets, costumes--all first rate.  Good acting jobs by entire ensemble.  Gives a great look at life in southeastern England during the war.  The war is not the focus, but it is always there.  Each 100-minute episode (disc) stands fairly well on its own.  At the same time, the episodes flow smoothly from one to another.  Recording rough in a very few spots.",1263772800,2,459,4.794871794871795
3847972,5,B0024OW1QQ,We've watched every episode of these series on Netflix and still loved them enough to want them as part of our library. The historical period is very interesting to learn more about and the episodes maintain the excellent quality of writing throughout the series. Michael Kitchen is superb as an actor & can convey so much without saying a word!,1263686400,,345,4.766666666666667
3847973,5,B0024OW1QQ,"This is an absolutely outstanding effort at recreating what life was like in Hastings, England for police officers trying to enforce the law during WWII. I wish there were 100 more episodes to purchase and enjoy!",1262822400,,212,4.916666666666667
3847974,5,B0024OW1QQ,"This is by far the best written, acted (love Michael Kitchen)series about WWI as told from a civilians perspective.  Read all the other reviews for the detail as I agree with all of them.  Kitchen is outstanding as Folye.  Sam his driver and his lt. were also outstanding and well developed characters.  I especially like Sam as she brought humor and a sense of how much deprevation the British people endured during WWII.  She went nuts around all the foods the American GIs brought over with them.  Buy this, watch this and if you are like me you will watch it over and over again.",1262390400,,583,4.504761904761905
3847975,5,B0024OW1QQ,"This is television at it's best. Delightful personal story lines intertwined with the reality of World War II history. The English towns and countrysides are genuine to the time period. Beautiful sets! Each episode has an actual theme of an event of World War II that is occuring while a criminal mystery is being investigated and brought to a successful conclusion by the local police department of Hastings. The main character Inspector Foyle is fabulous, so full of integrity and a quirky quietness. You can't help but want to spend time with him and the rest of the cast. BBC knows how to produce quality.",1260921600,2,609,4.809523809523809
3847976,5,B0024OW1QQ,"This series is just delightful. A British friend loaned us (I am USamerican) the first season... and we were hooked. The main characters are beautifully cast, and the stories are well written. Many episodes show sides of Britain's war experience that we don't learn about in school, such as anti-Semitism outside of Germany, or how some baddies profited from the war, or what a farmer felt to see the land that had been in his family for centuries simply paved over for a much-needed US military base. We sent my mother (age 75) the entire 19-DVD set, and she has absolutely loved it. Sometimes she waits for her sisters to join her to watch an episode, and sometimes she does not. (She's on her second run through.)",1259539200,8,716,4.645669291338582
