3060259,5,B00114UUBS,"My friend got me tickets to the taping of ""Happy Hour"" with Steve Byrne and it was unbelievable funny. I am not that big into stand-up comedy but this was some of the funniest stuff I have ever seen in my life. Since the show I  can't seem to get enough of Byrne. I've seen all his stuff on youtube, myspace and comedy central and its all HILARIOUS! I already pre-ordered this DVD and can't wait for it to come out. I know this is going to be on TV for free, but the 10 bucks is worth it to get all the dirty jokes that won't be aired on Comedy Central.",1206403200,5,553,3.9375
3060260,5,B00114UUBS,"I had the pleasure of a couple years ago going to see Nick Swardson perform his stand up on my college campus (Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, MI). Unfortunately, as soon as everyone arrived, someone came on stage and delivered the news that Swardson's flight was canceled and wouldn't be able to make it to perform stand up that night. The whole crowd instantly crashed and were all upset. We were told that one of the other comedians to open for Swardson, Steve Byrne, would be the new headliner. I am a HUGE Comedy Central Presents (and stand up in general) junkie and I had never even heard of him. After a local act to warm the crowd up, Byrne came on stage already in the hole because of the whole Swardson ordeal. He KILLED! One of the best stand up performances I have ever seen was his on my college campus, and I anxiously await his return to Grand Rapids, MI sometime in the near future I hope. I haven't seen his DVD, but I have seen his Comedy Central Presents and his live act, and if the DVD is anything like those, it will be amazing. His observance based humor is fantastic for those college aged and up and delivers it with precision and timing unlike any other. My respect for him only grew more when I saw him on the History Channels ""The History of The Joke"" talking about stand up. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone, because I would recommend this comedian to anyone.",1205366400,,1408,4.398467432950191
3060261,5,B00114UUBS,"Hey everyone, this is Steve Byrne.  I wanted to let you all know how thankful I am of you to take time and money out of your wallet to buy my first one hour special!  Lots of work went into the filming of this and I do hope you like it!  We filmed this over the summer of 07 in one evening.  Most shows you see filmed are done twice.  We didn't have that kind of budget, so I had one shot to get this right.  The audience ensured that a good time was going to be the case. The live crowd we had for the show was unreal!!!  What you see is a warts and all kind of performance and I love it. Its got loads of new jokes and some oldies but goodies.  I put the oldies on there, so that everyone can get all of my best jokes to date on my first real DVD!  There are on this DVD, loads of jokes that didn't make it to the edited and final cut of the Comedy Central special, so there is a lot of incentive to get the DVD.  The uncut and uncensored version is what the DVD is.  The dirty jokes that didn't make it to air are on here!  I hope you dig it!!!  Well, thats it for now, til next time...",1205107200,14,1089,3.7444933920704844
3060262,5,B00114UUBS,"I was fortunate enough to get tickets to Steve Byrne's comedy taping. He was immensely hilarious, and almost every single one of the jokes that he recorded that night will be sure to leave you laughing and asking for more.

I've been looking forward to this DVD since I left the show that night, my only hope is that it also has his friend Ahmed Ahmed - he was the ""warm-up"" act but very funny in his own way.

It'll be interesting to see if they captured a shot of me laughing like a dork, but I was off in a bad spot behind the boom camera so I doubt it.

Steve Byrne rocks and I am eagerly waiting for the opportunity to relive that night.

Also, Comedy Central may have already aired this special, or will be doing so, so look for it there.",1199836800,3,744,4.110344827586207
3060263,4,B00114UUBS,Steve Byrnes is funny without being too crude or over the top.  Enjoyable DVD- I look forward to seeing his other work as well.,1346025600,,127,4.291666666666667
3060264,5,B00114UUBS,"Recieved my movie after only a couple days of ordering, watched it the same day. Frequent order placer with this company, thank you.",1311206400,,132,4.782608695652174
3060265,5,B00114UUBS,I first saw this on Netflix over a year ago. Watched it a dozen times and laughed out loud every time. Eventually bought a DVD for myself and a few to give to my best friends. Went to his live show in San Jose last year and enjoyed every minute of it. Definitely my favorite comedian!,1283385600,,284,4.089285714285714
3060266,5,B00114UUBS,Steve Byrne is a fabulous entertainer and I was thrilled to find this video. It is hilarious.,1251158400,,93,4.529411764705882
3060267,5,B00114UUBS,Steve Byrne is so funny.  I have gone to see him 3 times know and when I found out he has a dvd I had to have it..great,1247529600,,119,3.25
3060268,4,B00114UUBS,"Steve Byrne was pretty funny. I laughed out loud a few times. Well worth the watch. And I would say Steve Byrne has a sobered version of Dane Cook style about him (he even talks in a lisp like Dane Cook sometimes does). By sobered, I don't mean Steve Byrne is incredibly less funny than Cook just less spastic. The bulk of Steve Byrne's act concerns being Asian, dating girls, having sex with girls, and not being sexually attractive enough to girls so he can have sex with them",1229299200,,478,4.382022471910112
3060269,5,B00114UUBS,"Let me say, first off, that I love Steve Byrne!

After seeing his comedy central presents, I have been a huge fan of his. This special has confirmed my belief that Steve Byrne is the funniest asian comic, ever.

If you've never heard of Steve Byrne, you should check out his myspace or maybe look up clips on youtube because once you see his stand-up, you'll be hooked.",1225238400,,369,4.411764705882353

3060271,5,B00114UUBS,If you are familiar with Steve Byrne you would like this! He has previous jokes in this standup but also adds new ones too to keep it entertaining! Its a must buy.,1209772800,,163,4.125
3060272,5,B00114UUBS,"This is the best stand-up show I have seen in the past two years. Already from the first joke with the magician and the male cheerleader, Steve Byrne had me laughing. And the laughing lasted 'till the end. I think Steve Byrne is going to be huge once the rest of the world opens up their eyes. Dane Cook better watch out, because Steve is already far better in my opinion. Everone can relate to his comedy. Guys, who haven't woken up from their own farts at night?  I can't wait to get my hands on more Steve Byrne!",1209340800,4,515,4.202020202020202
