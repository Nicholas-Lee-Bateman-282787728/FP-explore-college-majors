8101097,5,B000CRMT96,"Received the video in about 3 days (I used expedited shipping, $2 extra). This movie is fantastic, I loved every moment of it. Right after Portugal played Czech Republic today for Euro 2012 I popped this DVD in. Get this movie!! The only complaint I would have is the DVD case was cracked at the bottom, it probably wasn't your guys fault, but other then that good work!",1340236800,,370,4.455882352941177
8101098,5,B000CRMT96,A must buy for any Chelsea supporter. Who says we ain't got no history? 2012 FA Cup and Champions League winners!,1337385600,,113,4.428571428571429
8101099,5,B000CRMT96,"This is a great video on the history of Chelsea FC.  My cousin is Kerry Dixon (a Chelsea Legend interviewed in the video) so I am kind of biased.  But, anyone who loves Chelsea will love this video - very well done!",1291334400,,215,4.095238095238095

8101101,5,B000CRMT96,"Outstanding DVD for any Chelsea supporter... young or ""old""!

This is a terrific overview of the team that is currently defining English Premiership leadership on both the field and backroom.  With this DVD you will be able to see or (re-live) the historical highlights that got Chelsea FC to where they are today!

Go Blues in the season that just got underway!!",1218931200,,363,4.82258064516129
8101102,5,B000CRMT96,"I am Chelsea supporter so obviously a little bias. That said this is really a fascinating overview of the team that will undoubtedly, within the next year or so, rewrite all the record books in football.

Chelsea were hours away from bankruptcy before Roman Abramovich saved them and essentially turned them into the wealthiest sports team in the world. Whether you love them or hate them (all you Man Utd and Arsenal fans) they seem destined to become the team that every soccer club in the world will have to measure themselves against.

This DVD will show you how they got here, let fans relive highlights from all the CFC hero's from the past and introduce those that are hearing about Chelsea for the first time to the Cinderella story that is the History of Chelsea Football Club!

Come on you BLUES!!!!!

Also check out the 2 DVD set Chelsea F.C. Season Review 2004/2005 EPL Champions and see what I am talking about.",1134604800,8,924,4.6503067484662575
