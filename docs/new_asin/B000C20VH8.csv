8095219,5,B000C20VH8,At first we were a bit bored with the movie but then things started to pick up and became laughable.  These poor women get spooned by a pervert because of the cursed dress!  It isn't a slapstick type of funny...but it did make us giggle especially the ending!  The ending at the art museum with the pervert is what made the movie for us!  Loved the ending! We thought the movie started out odd...with an old couple arguing but then it picked up as others were affected by the dress.  It was well acted and paced as it never lingered on one person for too long.,1371340800,,560,4.245283018867925
