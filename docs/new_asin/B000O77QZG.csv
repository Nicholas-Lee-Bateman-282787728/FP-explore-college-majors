8183558,1,B000O77QZG,"This movie was so bad from the minute I began playing it, I knew it was not worth the 2.99 I paid to DL it. The acting is absolutely horrible looks like it was made from a camcorder. I believe they were trying to copy the Alfred Hitchcock short story about the monkeys paw which was a great episode but this was not even worth the 10 min I had it on. It was such bad acting it was not even tolerable to watch more than 5 min.

Don't waste your money I am usually pretty tolerable of B rated movies and even enjoy some of the corny movies but this is worse than the worse B rated I've ever seen.
