8586730,3,B00CVB6XYS,"I saw this movie many years ago,and being a Robert Taylor fan,simply had to get it. It isn't as good as his very best performances ( as a Roman general in ""Quo  Vadis"" or his best performance as ""Ivanhoe"" in the film of the same name).It is basically a tale of a boat captain down on his luck searching for treasure,but gets blindsided by drug traffickers.

Was not his best work,but was a nice change of pace from the historical epics RT had done through the early to mid fifties. And before he would go into western mode through the sixties until his death in 1969.",1509062400,,567,4.339622641509434

8586733,4,B00CVB6XYS,"Director Richard Thorpe and Taylor must have had a good working relationship (I think he directed 7 of Taylor's films), and it shows in Taylor's relaxed performence,. Some good dialogue, location work and a good cast (Nicole Maurey and Linda Christian), plus Donald Wolfit (who probably shot his scenes in 2 days on on an Office set.), David Kossoff (wasted) and Eric Pohlman etc. An excellent transfer 16.9 ratio, good B/w picture and clear sound help to make this an enjoyable if perhaps slightly slow adventure a worthwhile watch.

8586736,2,B00CVB6XYS,"I think Robert Taylor was a good actor but never he was nominate for The Academy Awards because he made a lot of B movies like The House of Seven Hawks, that for me it was the worse movie of all that he made. His debut in ""Camille"" with Greta Garbo in 1937 it was the best movie that he made in all his cinematography career as movie star.",1391385600,,339,3.927536231884058
8586737,4,B00CVB6XYS,"House of the Seven Hawks was released in December 1959, when its star, Robert Taylor, was forty-eight years old.  It is a mystery based on Victor Canning's best selling book, House of the Seven Flies. The plot concerns John Nordley, an American ex-pat who lives in Britain and runs a charter boat.  Captain Nordley is flung into a convoluted situation involving dead policemen, ex-Nazis, scheming women, creepy crooks and innocent daughters.

The New York Times called the movie ""a satisfying labyrinthine plot and carefully placed direction and underplaying that adds up to a modest but truly taut and absorbing diversion.""  The director is Richard Thorpe, who had worked with Taylor before on six other movies, including The Crowd Roars, Ivanhoe and Knights of the Round Table.

Despite being basically a suspense film House of the Seven Hawks has a considerable comic undertone.  Robert Taylor plays Nordley as the only sane man in a nest of loonies.  No one is what they are supposed to be, with people assuming false identities and numerous double-crosses.

Other than Taylor, the cast is European.  Nicole Maurey plays the love interest.  Linda Christian is a one of the double-crossers.  Donald Wolfitt and Gerard Heinz are policemen. David Kossoff, Eric Pohlmann and Philo Hauser are villains.  The story ends with a diving expedition to recover stolen treasure and a satisfying shoot-out.

I'm not sure Robert Taylor took this movie terribly seriously.  He wears the same costume throughout the film, including an Eisenhower jacket that he had made for himself. He does a little mugging, especially when Nordley is being asked to believe one fantastic lie after another.  Far from being wooden, he displays considerable facial flexibility.  Mr. Taylor does look as though he's having fun.

MGM seems to be insisting that Mr. Taylor is much younger than his actual age.  Nicole Maurey is  too young for him.  He is referred to in one scene as a young man.  As in so many films the story gets him out of his clothes.  The Taylor body is in good shape for a 48 year old, but it's not the body he had twenty years earlier.  Nonetheless this film provides good, undemanding and ultimately satisfying entertainment.",1370044800,11,2218,4.983651226158038
