6184108,5,B00HM7R9V2,Wow! At first I didn't know anything about this movie except what the description. Micheal Okeefe from Caddy Shack fame is a cop. All this guy had to do was steal a tv from an upscale neighborhood but a resovoir dog style turnaround gets out of control. Great movie which keeps ur eyes focused on the screen.....Keeps ur attention all throughout......A real treat!,1404518400,2,364,4.7936507936507935
6184109,5,B00HM7R9V2,"Junction is the story of a group of meth addicts who venture into a home to steal a television, and come away with knowledge of a dark secret. Throughout the film, the viewer is treated to a tense series of events that stem from how the addicts believe the situation should be handled.

Junction is a dark movie, but it is captivating in how it examines the human psyche. Despite their past transgressions and drug dependency, the characters still maintain a sense of morality. The cast does a good job in demonstrating the rawness of the characters and there are enough plot twists to keep the plot engaging.",1402790400,7,609,4.638888888888889
6184110,5,B00HM7R9V2,"What I believed to be a back ground noise DVD, was not! There is some really dark humor in the first half of this movie and very stirring performances all throughout the movie. the only complaint I would make is David Zayas as the Police Lieutenant, didn't buy it at all. Every one else right down to the little girl are all superlative. You laugh some, you sympathize some and cringe a bit, make no mistake this is a very harsh movie but well worth the watch. The message in this movie is a simple one...we all make choices. I won't go into detail about the movie because I don't want to give anything away. Check it out.",1402444800,4,622,4.279661016949152

While they are getting the TV a guy who had been abused as a youth finds DVDs of youth abuse and demands that they punish the home owners.  Then the home owners return home with their young daughter and it become a hostage situation when the police show-up.

Violent and blood, not for the faint of heart, but a good character study. Not soon forgotten.",1400284800,3,471,4.402298850574713
6184112,3,B00HM7R9V2,No subtitles for heard of hearing or to compensate for poor enunciation or audio level control. An indicator of cheap. The excessive overacting coupled with stereotypic portrayals of the characters made it hard to believe in the story or care much about the characters. Story itself also gave way to disbelief in that a prolonged theft of a simple tele turns into a prolonged crusade. About half way through you get a sense that a twist (s) is about to take place and to the writer's credit it turns out to be one that may have been least expected.,1399766400,,548,4.545454545454546
6184113,5,B00HM7R9V2,"I was pleasantly surprised to come across this movie in my travels. Although the acting is not perfect, the move is produced extremely well and is worth a gander, Kudos to the production and editorial staff on this one.",1398643200,3,219,4.641025641025641
6184114,4,B00HM7R9V2,"Emily over at BluntReview (dot) com says: Often a smaller film allows for you, as the audience, to leave perceptions from an actor at the door; Ryan Gosling's smug smirk for example (it was not there when he was pure; see The United States of Leland for example). And here, Junction is very much richer for the lack of brand name actor de jour attached. The performances are great, and you have no clue as to where or when a shift in dynamic is coming. The cast's usual is not known! It makes for a visceral viewing ; which, is what appears to be its point. Junction is a tightly scripted, excellently edited drama with a lot of tight wire tension; absolutely due to its cast.

Story goes...it is just another day in the life of once human meth addicts looking for the next fix; and all the work that goes into getting the high. But, the dealer (Anthony Ruivivar), who is into bartering as one of the group is an ex-Rehab mate, suggests he would take a TV for his mom. A kind gesture no?

Hmm. Drug rattled brains or not, where does one get a television at dawn, without any money? Oh my, of course. Someone's home.

As each tension filled moment unravels the film's plot is gloriously unknown. There are so many factors written in, even the most jaded of viewers should be intrigued. Plus, the cast is so tight, they often sound like they are making up there lines ala the Christopher Guest ensemble. The words and actions ring eerily true and your skin should start to crawl about 15 minutes in.

Each of the drug-fueled ensemble are powerful actors.  The girl, Summer Crockett Moore is a more than just a chickbabe beneath the meth- aged-make up. You're right there with her as her former self reconcile's with her drug self. Neal Bledsoe, too. This yummy under the hue of drug encrusted loser, is another to watch closely; handsome and talented - the double dose combo so many wish they had so effortlessly. Then there's Tom Pelphrey who breaks your heart while scaring you to the point of a reaction of hand covering eyes. Yet the show stealer of this fab four is perhaps Harris Doran. He has some pretty great lines, and in lesser hands they'd plunk, and possibly derail the storyline. Yet, his acting choices are so un telegraphed, at the end, you have nothing to say but wow.

The family (Anthony Rapp, Sharon Maguire and little Danielle Koch) are wonderful as the unit that is at the whim of the house breakers.

The ""star names"" show up in the police force. You get David Zayas - who does great cop, and Michael O'Keefe aside him - the two play their own dynamic within a sticky situation wonderfully.

Junction is a smart film, made smarter by the choice in casting and the strong camera use choices. And it's a writer/director piece by Tony Glazer - so a success of the dual role can be done! A nod to the film's editor, Phyllis Housen for timing her cuts for tension and musicman Austin Wintory for not over doing it; keeping the music as a wonderful shadow that works with the performances. OK. Film snobbery aside, simply stated, Junction is a smart engrossing thriller that slowly careens into its real-life-like ending. Bravo.

Snack Recommendation: None, but, you'll want to click on the actor's IMDB pages; They are all stunning.",1398211200,9,3248,4.55746140651801
8633456,4,B00HM7R9V2,Now I do not understand how Donald and crew could not see that it was the wife and not the husband-oh were only kids on the videos? Props to the dad for not saying anything. Why did the wife kill Carnie? Wife all around demented. Why ask folks you do not trust to tie up folks you want tied up?  How did they keep losing sight of the little girl and why wasn't she tied up? The drug dealer is hilarious-did he get his tv or what? All the drugs he selling he could not afford to purchase a dang tv?,1530489600,,497,3.9207920792079207

8633460,5,B00HM7R9V2,"I can't even begin to describe the plot twists in this BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT THRILLER.

I can't say ANYTHING about the plot because it twists from the first minute.

I don't remember being so THRILLED, with my heart ACTUALLY POUNDING, holding my breath, gasping, jaw dropping, eyes wide open, hands over my face, peeking between my fingers!

YOU WANT A THRILLER WITH THE GREATEST PLOT SINCE PSYCHO, absolutely perfect performances by every actor, not one bad sentence, every single actor PERFECT? HERE IT IS. Director genius.

 But WHOEVER WROTE THAT SCREENPLAY, if they didn't win an Oscar for that, then something is very wrong. This film goes down as one of the best I ever saw in my entire life.",1497052800,,698,4.831932773109243
8633461,5,B00HM7R9V2,Great suspense and acting. If you are in the mood for an action-thriller then you have found your movie. Or one of them at least.,1486771200,,129,4.2

8633464,1,B00HM7R9V2,"Four tweakers break into a house to steal a flat-screen television that they plan to exchange for drugs.  One of the four finds a box of kiddie porn and completely loses whatever slim thread of sanity that he might have had and instantly becomes a complete wreck who refuses to leave the house.  When the family comes home the situation quickly escalates where the tweakers end up taking the entire family hostage and the crazy agitated one decides that he needs to kill the father so the man can never do anything bad to his daughter.

Junction is extremely hard to sit through because, unlike The Salton Sea and Spun, Junction never figures out how to create tweaker characters that aren't entirely unbearable to watch.  These four are so far beyond obnoxious and unsympathetic that Junction mostly feels like you are being forced to watch four of the most entirely worthless and stupid people on the face of the earth as they make nothing but one bad decision after another.  The tweakers are so irritating that the pedophile husband is actually more sympathetic.

Things get worse for the characters and the movie when police surround the house trying to negotiate an end to the hostage situation--the cops turn out to be about as competent as the tweakers and the screenplay goes from not very good to totally f**king ridiculous.  The wife of the pedophile not only knows what her husband is but is more concerned with destroying the kiddie porn before the cops get in than with the safety of her daughter.  The tweakers can't come up with one decent idea to deal with the situation and never seem to realize that they should be working together instead of ripping at each other's throats.

Junction does manage one sorta interesting twist at the end but it's too little too late for a movie that never works as a thriller or crime drama or say no to drugs morality piece or as anything, really, other than a really terrible way to waste an hour and a half of your life.",1421107200,4,1975,4.636103151862464
