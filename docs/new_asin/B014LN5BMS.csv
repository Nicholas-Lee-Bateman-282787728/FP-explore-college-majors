8731395,5,B014LN5BMS,"Pot O' Gold  Beautifully restored romantic, musical comedy. Another excellent quality transfer from DigiComTV. Hilarious, madcap comedy set in the 1940s featuring Jimmy Stewart as a failing music store owner whose insanely funny uncle wants him to join his food factory business. Stewart winds up befriending his uncles worst nightmare  a family of Irish musicians who are constantly practicing, and unnerving the music-hating uncle whose food factory is right next door.

One thing leads to another and Stewart and his uncle wind up jailed over a tomato-throwing incident gone awry. In the midst of all this chaos is beautiful Paulette Goddard, who is also a member of the musical Irish family next door. She finds herself getting caught up not only in Stewarts problems, but the uncles as well. Goddard is totally unaware that Stewart and his uncle are related. This she finds out at toward the end of the film. In the meantime, she begins to fall in love with Stewart as the speed of comedic events begin to pick up.

Stewart finds himself trying to help the Irish family get gigs. He ends up placing them on his uncles radio show while he has cleverly shuffled his music-hating uncle off to Canada. The radio show is a big success with the Irish musicians, and Goddard decides to announce there will be a $1,000 giveaway every week on the program. Now, how does one sort out this mess? Giving away money on a radio show is illegal.

Hijinks abound as Stewart and Goddard try to figure out how they are going to legally give away $1,000 a week. The uncle returns from Canada just as they have figured out a solution to the giveaway.

Happy endings for all when advertising sponsors want to purchase the successful program from the music-hating uncle, while at the same time Stewart announces his engagement to Goddard over the air.

This film is peppered throughout with absolutely hysterical scenes and madcap adventures. A real classic youll want to watch over and over. Its laughter and gaiety is as relevant now as it certainly was in the 1940s. This film will definitely keep you in stitches..

Second Chorus (1940) is a Hollywood musical comedy film starring Paulette Goddard and Fred Astaire, and featuring Artie Shaw.. Nicely restored version by DigicomTV. Audio and visual quality are great!

In a 1968 interview, Astaire described this effort as ""The worst film I ever made"". Astaire admitted that he was attracted to the film by the opportunity to ""dance-conduct this real swingin' outfit"". In an interview shortly before his death, Shaw admitted this film put him off acting. Astaire and Shaw shared a striking series of personality traits in common: an obsessive perfectionism and seemingly endless appetite for retakes, profound musicality and love of jazz, personal modesty and charm, and in a late interview Shaw expressed his opinion of Astaire: ""Astaire really sweat - he toiled. He was a humorless Teutonic man, the opposite of his debonair image in top hat and tails. I liked him because he was an entertainer and an artist. There's a distinction between them. An artist is concerned only with what is acceptable to himself, where an entertainer strives to please the public. Astaire did both. Louis Armstrong was another"".

Danny O'Neill (Fred Astaire), and Hank Taylor (Burgess Meredith) are friends and rival trumpeters, with ""O'Neill's Perennials"", a college band. Both of them have managed to prolong their college career by failing seven years in a row. At a performance, Ellen Miller (Paulette Goddard) catches Danny and Hank's eye. She serves them a collection notice for her boss, a debt collector, but the fast talking O'Neill and Taylor soon have her working for them as their manager.

Tired of losing gigs to the Perennials, Artie Shaw, playing himself, comes to woo Ellen away to be his booking manager. She tries to get Danny and Hank an audition for Shaw's band, but their jealous hi-jinks get them both fired.

Watch the movie to see how it ends..... You'll love it! And so will the entire family.......",1440806400,,4043,4.920704845814978
