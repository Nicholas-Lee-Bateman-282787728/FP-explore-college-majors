8670721,5,B00M8DGLCI,Great virtual cycling experience!  This DVD helped cut some of the boring drudgery of cycling indoors .  The riders are moving really fast in the video and it makes you feel as though you are flying down the road as well.  Overall very happy with the purchase,1494288000,,259,4.468085106382978

8670723,5,B00M8DGLCI,This title is my 2nd title in the Global Ride series. 1st was Club Ride in France. A third is already on order. I do a lot on indoor riding during the winter in NJ...summers too because road traffic is nuts. I have a 10 yr old VHS/DVD library of cycling workouts. I find the Global Ride series the best overall. The key to GR is the coaching and the group experience.  I find it easier to ramp up the intensity when the riders all pass you and you are coached to catch up or coached to stay up with the lead pack. It really seem to work for me. The Maui Madness DVD is especially enjoyable because its on rolling hills rather than a steady uphill route....some built in rest. I track my HR on my workouts and I am seeing better HR results than other non-coached virtual rides....plus you can't beat the scenery.,1420070400,6,811,4.232258064516129

Another fantastic location!  Thanks Global Ride.  One of these days I have to join you on a trip for real.",1419811200,6,257,4.270833333333333
