8299381,5,B001ER4CRK,"I bought this DVD for my son because he had seen the show MXC on TV and just loved the show. These DVDs are hilarious! The stunts that the contestants take part in are ridiculously funny, and the constant commentary keeps all of us laughing! Then, of course, there's the slo-mo of some stunts, playing them backwards, and it goes on and on for an evening filled with laughter! These dvds were so good, I went back and bought the others that we didn't have!! I highly recommend these DVDs!! They're great for a family night of TV!",1388707200,,529,4.408163265306122
