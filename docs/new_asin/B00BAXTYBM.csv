I love the way they put bubble guppies, team umizoomi, dora and quite a few other shows in their mix. My kids have seen other nickelodeon cartoon mixes but this one was their favorite so far.",1382140800,6,302,4.224137931034483

5567038,5,B00BAXTYBM,i love how there are so many shows to watch on this one and it is great to watch on our amazon instant video apps on all of our devices,1375833600,,135,3.533333333333333
5567039,5,B00BAXTYBM,This was a lifesaver for a very long car ride with our 2 year old boy. All his favorite characters and fairy tales so you can't go wrong. Glad we purchased and recommend.,1372377600,,170,4.181818181818182
5567040,5,B00BAXTYBM,"I think each of the stories in this episode are cute. My three year old sons enjoyed watching them, especially the Oomi Zumi and Bubble Guppies story lines.",1371686400,,156,4.607142857142857
5567041,5,B00BAXTYBM,"For all of the children that watch Bubble Guppies, Team Umizoomi, Dora the Explorer, etc. this is the perfect DVD. It provides about 2 hours of different stories that appeal to toddlers & younger children. It teaches them math, shapes, language, etc. It keeps their attention & teaches them at the same time. Highly recommended!",1371427200,,328,4.9818181818181815
5567042,5,B00BAXTYBM,"My kids love their Nickelodeon characters but sometimes there are shows they don't really like or ones that I prefer they didn't watch.  This is a great DVD collection with episodes from six of their favorite character friends.  The DVD has a total of seven episodes with just over two hours of wholesome preschool fun.

Bubble Guppies
""Who's Gonna Play the Big Bad Wolf""

Team Umizoomi
""The Umi City Treasure Hunt""

The Fresh Beat Band
""Royal Wedding""

Dora the Explorer
""Dora Saves the Three Little Piggies""

Wonder Pets!
""Help the Cow jump over the moon"" / ""Save the Unicorn""

Blue's Room
""Little Red Riding Blue""

We love this DVD because my boys can take their favorite Nickelodeon characters with them anytime they want.  While these episodes have been previously aired on television, it is still nice to have them all on one DVD.  Blue's Room is probably their favorite because its not one they normally watch on Nickelodeon, so its new to them.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1367884800,17,1026,4.767045454545454
5567043,5,B00BAXTYBM,"Nickelodeon will be releasing Once Upon a Rhyme on DVD on April 30, 2013 featuring the most popular nursery rhyme episodes from Bubble Guppies, Team Umizoomi, The Fresh Beat Band, Dora the Explorer, The Wonder Pets!, and Blue's Room.

I'm not too familiar with the programs aimed for pre-schoolers, but I was aware of Dora the Explorer and Blue's Room, but the other four shows are new to me. Nickelodeon nicely sent me a complimentary early copy for this review in exchange for my honest opinion.

Bubble Guppies is completely new to me. The series takes place in the underwater city Bubbletucky. This release features the episode ""Who's Gonna Play the Big Bad Wolf"", where Deema finds her passion for acting when she fills in as the Big Bad Wolf for the production of The Three Little Pigs.

In the episode Umi City Treasure Hunt from the series Team Umizoomi, Milli, Geo and Bolt find a treasure map and go on a treasure hunt all across Umi City. This is a cute episode with lots of adventure, plus it is also educational.

The Fresh Beat Band is the only live-action series on this release, featuring the episode ""Royal Wedding"", where the band is excited about the upcoming Royal Wedding, but the wedding may never happen as the Princess has a crush on their fellow band member, Twist. The episode reminds me of S Club 7, only sillier. I'm sure children will love the catchy music.

In Dora Saves the Three Little Piggies, Dora the Explorer, along with Boots and Swiper, are on a mission to restore the fairy tale ""The Three Little Piggies"" back to the original version. I have heard of Dora the Explorer, but this is my first time watching it. I can see why the series is popular with kids as Dora teaches and entertains the viewers at the same time.

There are two episodes of The Wonder Pets!, starting with ""Help the Cow How Jumped Over the Moon"", where the pets are off on an adventure to help the Young Cow jump over the moon. The Wonder Pets jump into a storybook in ""Save the Unicorn"" to help a Baby Unicorn, who's horn is stuck in a tree. The animation style is silly, but there are several catchy songs.

Everybody's favorite female puppy returns in Blue's Room ( a short-lived spin-off of Blue's Clues), where Blue and her friends Sprinkles, Roary, Goldie, and Joe, act out their own version of the fairy tale classic in ""Little Red Riding Blue"".

Once Upon a Rhyme has over two full hours of educational fun that kids and adults will enjoy watching together. I didn't know what to expect from these episodes, but I ended up enjoying each one. Families will be taking their summer vacations soon and I think Once Upon a Rhyme would be solid entertainment for kids to watch on a portable DVD player. Overall, I liked every episode of these Nickelodeon classics and I recommend it to others.",1366070400,13,2805,4.573705179282869

5567117,2,B00BAXTYBM,"I missed something. I thought that this was a story combining the different universes together so that all characters were in one show.  Nope.  It's just individual cartoons from several shows.  So, yeah, your kids have probably seen them all if they watch the shows.  I actually wouldn't have bought it had I known that. It's a little bit of a waste.",1418774400,2,351,4.612903225806452

5567122,4,B00BAXTYBM,"The item description and previous reviews never said what shows were in this DVD. I assumed it would only be episodes from the from the shows on the characters on the cover. It's actually only one episode of Bubble Guppies, Team Umizoomi, Dora, The Fresh Beat Band, The Wonder Pets, and Blue's Room (not Blue's Clues.) luckily this DVD is so cheap I can't be but so disappointed. Plus, my daughter loves Dora and the Bubble Guppies so much it makes it worth every penny. I'll attach a picture of the back so you can see what exact episodes are in this disc.",1411171200,42,557,4.41747572815534
