2901898,5,B000TJ6P5Q,"I  purchased three ""Firm"" workout videos at the same time.  This is the first workout I did.  Not being used to the commands in the video, took me two or three times to get comfortable with them.  I now have used the video several times and pay no attention to the commands but just have a good time and work out.  This is an excellent low impact workout that burns calories and makes you feel good and not exhausted.",1212969600,,417,4.227848101265823
2901899,3,B000TJ6P5Q,"The Firm's ""Cardio Sculpt Fusion"" is a unique, low-impact workout designed to be an effective exercise program to give your body a break in between harder workouts.
I own this DVD under the original title of ""Total Body Lite,"" which is a much more accurate description. I'm kinda puzzled as to why The Firm changed the title and re-released it. Anyway...
As an at-home exercise junkie, I am always looking for something fresh and different to try, and being a fan of The Firm, I wanted to give this one a go. After doing this twice, I can say that I am pretty pleased with my purchase.
""Cardio Sculpt Fusion,"" at 47 minutes in length, is a unique hybrid of standing pilates/ballet-like moves, light sculpting, low-impact dance-y cardio and some yoga moves. The whole idea is to stretch out your body and make your muscles long and lean, like those of a dancer.
You begin with a light cardio warmup that uses plies, twists and other dance-like movements to get your heartrate up a notch. It lasts about 7 minutes.
The workout itself consists of about 3 toning/stretching segments (using a pair of light weights and 1 single medium weight) that blend traditional Firm-style lunges, squats, bicep curls and arm raises at a slower pace with stretches. Interspersed between the toning/stretching are 2 low-impact (no jumping), light cardio segments. The first cardio segment, again, is all about lengthening your muscles and aims to stretch you out with (brisk) reaching and simultaneous reaching of your arms and extending your legs with pointed toes. The 2nd cardio section has side-to-side steps and mambos.
Though this is not the MOST challenging or effective workout out there, it is great to add variety on a light day. And make no mistake: the combination of the toning and cardio WILL make you sweat. And you will DEFINITELY feel this in your buns and legs particularly (especially after that chair pose and corkscrew near the end...Whew!).
(And note, if you want to take it up a notch, you could always combine with another workout. To make this harder, I actually preceed this workout with a 10-15 minute express workout so that I've already broken a sweat by the time I begin the warmup. By the end of the hour, I'm pretty darn sweaty!)
The cool-down has - no surprise - more stretching, and also a simple but (for me) challenging obligue exercise called, I believe, ""the star."" This cool-down was a little dissapointing in the fact that it was lacking in the abs department (anyone who is familiar with The Firm knows that there are usually good ab exercises during the cool-down).
The music was a little on the generic, bad side (okay it's horrible!), but then it's not very loud, so it shouldn't grate on your nerves TOO much.
Emily Welsh is an upbeat and very cute (she can't be much over 5 feet!) and motivating instructor.
All together, this DVD loses a star for bad music and another one for not being challenging enough to do more than once a week (come on, the cardio could have been a LITTLE harder/longer...)!
Recommended for a lighter day or in combination with another express workout.",1212451200,8,3104,4.7606679035250465
2901900,1,B000TJ6P5Q,"I have been using the Firm for over 10 years. I own almost every DVD they come out with, but I am disappointed in their marketing. This DVD is the exact same at Total Body Lite. Since I already had Total Body Lite which comes with their advanced package I have two of the same workout with two different titles. The workout itself is ok, but I don't like it enough to have two copies.",1210809600,8,384,4.133333333333334
2901901,3,B000TJ6P5Q,"This is actually Total Body Lite, which is what it should be called instead of Cardio Sculpt Fusion.  It isn't a hard workout, but is still good if you are looking for a light way of working out for a day.  It doesn't target the arms and the abs as much as I would like, but it is overall a great tape for a beginner or for a light workout.",1207699200,8,340,3.842857142857143
2901902,2,B000TJ6P5Q,I had a problem with this firm DVD because she makes you turn sideways for half the exercises for no real purpose and its annoying trying to look at the tv.,1206316800,,156,4.064516129032258
2901903,5,B000TJ6P5Q,"This a great new workout. I love some of the new moves Emily has incorporated. Emily uses light dumbbells through out the video, and has come up with some creative new moves. One video I will hold on to.",1201219200,4,203,4.230769230769231
2901904,5,B000TJ6P5Q,"This is about my third or fourth The Firm dvd workout, and I think it's one of the best ones from them.  I've done it twice already and I found it fun and doable and I sweated up a storm.
It's not too tough and in fact I'd mainly use this on days where I don't want an intense workout but yet still want to burn some calories.  It's a combination of fat burning and toning; the cardio is low impact and aerobic classics with latin dance.  The toning blends yoga with traditional body sculpting.  Emily teaches all the moves in 'add on' style where you learn a base move and go from there.  She is a good cuer and instructor who's encouraging and pushes you along.
All up, it's about 45 minutes and you feel good afterward.  I wouldn't use this every single day as there are far more challenging routines out there to do more often, but I would do this once or twice a week on days where you want an easier pace of workout but one that's still beneficial.",1200787200,16,954,4.185792349726776
2901905,4,B000TJ6P5Q,"I just received this workout. I'm giving it 4 at this point because as the previous reviewer has noted there is a lot of arm and leg movement, and it's a challenge to my coordination.  However, I have done the 25 minute segment a couple times, and am pleased with it. For those times when you don't want to do a full workout or your time is short, it allows you to get in a nice little bit of work out. The only thing I'd change is shortening the warm-up and stretch and give a longer actual work out. But that doesn't take away from the worth,
  I haven't gotten all the way through the 45 minute work-out yet, it's coming down to the coordination thing, but I think once I get the hang of the choreography, I will really like this one.",1200182400,7,737,4.13986013986014
2901906,4,B000TJ6P5Q,"Cardio Sculpt Fusion is billed as a low impact, low intensity recovery circuit workout...very accurate description.  The full workout runs about 46 minutes.  There's also a 25 minute express workout that skips the cardio segments and a couple of the weighted segments from the full workout.

The instructor, Emily Welsh does a decent job cueing the moves.  All of the cardio is low impact and easy to do on carpet.  The strength moves are the usual newer-Firm compound moves, starting with leg movement and then adding the arms.  If you are not very coordinated, you might not like these newer Firms...a lot going on with the arms and legs! I enjoy these newer Firms because I feel like I get a lot done in a short amount of time.

As this is a recovery circuit tape, there's an emphasis on stretching throughout...I really enjoyed this one.

The main reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the music, which is pretty bad.  Fortunately, the music level is low enough so that I didn't notice it the majority of the time.

Recommend to coordinated high beginners and intermediates.",1197936000,21,1075,4.7005347593582885

In addition, Emily sometimes talks way too fast and I can't understand her instructions.  I should be used to that with her, because I have other videos where she is the instructor.  However, this workout is excellent for recovery.  It would be great to do on your rest day so that you stretch out, keep loose, and just feel better.

2901953,5,B000TJ6P5Q,"I used to do The Firm workouts 4-5 days per week and got in great shape from them. However, I had an ankle injury (from before) that got aggravated badly and stopped pretty much everything for several years in order to avoid surgery on my ankle. I have been so stressed out lately that I realized on my way home today I was actually CRAVING a Firm workout. I have a pretty large selection but chose this one for its low-impact qualities, since I'm in pretty terrible shape now. I probably haven't done this DVD in 5 years, and I was still able to follow it easily. It was really great--just what I needed. Enough energy to get the pent-up aggression out, but low-impact enough that I could get through the whole thing without stopping, despite my serious lack of cardio in the past few years (I've only been doing some of the ballet barre workouts-very rarely, and some horseback riding a couple times a month if I'm lucky). I got a decent sweat going with this DVD, got through it before I had to get to class tonight, and it hasn't seemed to bother my ankle (or my back). My knees are a little sore, but I think that's because our carpet isn't very cushy at all--I'm going to use a mat next time. My knees feel like I've been kneeling for a while, not like they've been twisted or injured. I was careful to pick my feet up and do the moves instead of twist when the move called for sliding or turning the foot--easy to do on hardwood floors, but treacherous on carpet. It also didn't completely wear me out--I'm often way too exhausted after a workout to accomplish anything else that day, but this actually energized me--so this is what everyone means when they say they feel good after exercising! I think this DVD just got me back into working out.",1392076800,,1753,4.396923076923077
2901954,2,B000TJ6P5Q,"I saw this DVD at the library, and was very excited to see that the DVD case noted that the workout is closed-captioned.  However, the DVD is *not* captioned, and if you are deaf or hard of hearing, you will likely find it extremely difficult to follow the program.  For any reader who thinks that the absence of voice instruction is not frustrating, just hit the mute button the next time you do a new workout, and experience first-hand how much you miss.

I have been using exercise tapes and DVDs for about 15 years, and have gone through dozens of them, so there aren't many surprises at this point, but I found this workout to be more annoying than pleasant.  The cardio is flat-out boring, with the weight segments requiring one pair of light dumbbells, and a single heavier one.

The stretching section at the end was the best part, and the reason that I didn't give this DVD just a single star.

Since I checked this DVD out at the library, I didn't waste my money on it, and I hope that the producers correct the error in the packaging so that no one else buys the product thinking that it has captions or subtitles.",1361059200,,1125,4.4106280193236715

2901956,3,B000TJ6P5Q,"I really wanted to like this dvd. It's difficult for me to remember dance steps especially if it's that unmotivating ""generic exercise music"". I was hoping for simple dance moves on my day off because I put my all into my heavy days. The rest of the workout seemed pretty good. The instructor kept stressing how good & relaxing it should feel a little too often though. If the music were better, I could hop around doing my own thing- but I would have to do too much modifying to really enjoy this one- probably will not get much use. I've decided to try a light yoga toning dvd instead.",1290384000,,587,4.345454545454546
2901996,5,B000TJ6P5Q,"I recently purchased The Firm Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection, and this 46-minute workout was one of the four selections included on that DVD. Emily Welsh leads this workout with 4 background exercisers, including Sue-Mi showing modifications; they are exercising on the Firm's newer, airy white set.  Emily describes this as a ""muscle recovery workout,"" and she emphasizes that you don't want to fatigue your muscles during the workout.  Given this, she uses light weights throughout--either a single 5# or 2 lighter weights (I used 3#).  However, this is still a true AWT (aerobic weight training) workout in that you are constantly moving while using the weights, keeping your heart rate up the entire time.

Emily begins with a 5-minute warm-up.  Rather than the Firm's traditional moves, there are some different exercises here, such as a spinal twist with a bit of a lunge (although Emily also does plie squats and lunge/glute lifts) as well as about 1 minute dynamic stretching.  The first weights segment is 5 minutes long, and Emily has you pick up one dumbbell to start for a squat with balance and overhead tricep move.  Next is a dip and scoop moving into a rear dip/side squat with arms.  This is followed by the ""butt and back burner,"" a deadlift with leg extensions and arms plus side leg extensions.  Emily concludes with some brief back stretches.

Another 5-minute weight segment follows.  This one starts with a lunge/knee lift/chest opener combination, adding a leg extension.  Next come side plies with external rotation to work the rotator cuff (nice!) and then a more standard Firm move, pivots with alternating biceps/triceps.  The last exercise is a 1-arm row, but Emily adds a knee raise to this familiar move, and she again concludes with some brief stretching.  The first cardio segment is also about 5 minutes long, and it begins with a step tap forward, adding a knee up and a leg extension.  This is followed by a cross step with glute extension in a single-single-double pattern (Emily uses this pattern often).  The final two moves are a V-step which expands into a larger turn step and a side lunge with knee; the entire sequence is repeated several times.

The next weights series (also 5 minutes) starts with a side lunge and then adds arm scoops and center kicks.  Additional exercises are tap squats with clean and press and pendulum (a side delt move) with toe taps; again, Emily concludes with stretching.  For the second cardio section, Emily states ""we're gonna get a little sassy!""  The moves include side hips, triple step, samba, and mambo.  Although the moves themselves weren't all that complicated, it seemed like Emily tried to do a bit too much with changing the direction (L-R) and tempo.  The final standing weights segment (5 minutes) begins with Figure 8 side lunges and then moves into lunges with knee lifts plus triceps/tummy toner.  Without the weights, Emily cues chair pose to side squat to rear lunge, finishing with a twisting lunge (corkscrew).  She finishes the segment with a moving warrior stretch.

The 5-minute floor work begins with ""star,"" a side plank move.  This is followed by ""moving cat,"" which includes both a leg extension and a push-up.  Next comes flying bug and only one slightly more traditional crunch move, circle abs.  Emily begins the 5.5 minute stretch lying on the back for thread the needle, then switches over to the stomach for cobra and a thigh stretch.  From a seated position, she moves through mermaid, a hamstring stretch, and a twist, and finally, she concludes the workout standing with inner thigh and neck stretches.

I really enjoyed this workout!  I do like Emily, and I thought she did a nice job leading here.  Those looking for a hard-core workout might be disappointed, but I think those who enjoy Ellen Barrett-style workouts are apt to enjoy this as well.  (In fact, although the crew here wear shoes, the workout is entirely low-impact and could be done barefoot as with Ellen's workouts.)  I consider myself to be a high intermediate exerciser, but I still got a lot of of this workout, and I will continue using it for recovery (or whenever I need a lighter day) as Emily recommends.",1287619200,4,4193,4.8923512747875355
2901997,3,B000TJ6P5Q,"I am a firm fan and have several videos, but I'm  not that impressed with this one.  It is designed to be a lighter workout, but I get frustrated because there is not enough cueing and some of the transitions are too fast.  Usually after a couple times of doing a workout I have it down.  Not so much with this one.  I'm sure it will grow on me and besides it was so cheap I couldn't pass it up.",1286409600,,395,3.8875
2901998,5,B000TJ6P5Q,":) Emily is once again very enjoyable as I have some of her other FIRM dvds. This one is definitely a mix between cardio, strength, yoga, and pilates style movements. Your heart rate will get up there so you are burning cal & fat. I got this dvd a week ago and have been doing it everyday. Cheers to Strength!",1278720000,,309,4.166666666666667
2901999,5,B000TJ6P5Q,"este dvd del firm es buenisimo para  utilizarlo para relajar los musculos, despues de hacer los ejercicios de otros videos como body toner y total body time chruch, puesto que son ejercicios casi sin impacto en los musculos y articulaciones",1266192000,,240,5.0
2902000,5,B000TJ6P5Q,"This workout has some definite advantages over the other Firm workouts. While most workouts from the Firm tend to be very fast-paced with barely enough time to transition between moves, the pace of this one is slower so that you can focus more on good form. This translates into better execution of the moves, a reduced risk of injury and a smoother workout.

The stretches incorporated between the sculpting moves are a geat addition, since they work the tension out of the muscles BEFORE the next move, allowing you to execute the next move with better form. The emphasis on grace and fluidity in this workout will also improve your balance and your ability to transition smoothly between moves. If you focus properly during this workout, you will find that you can better access your core stregth because of the slower pace. The whole-body emphasis means that your posture will be better and your moves will be less jerky than they would be doing a faster-paced workout.

Many reviewers have panned this DVD based on the ""faster is better"" mentality. If your goal is to be fit and as free from injury as possible for the rest of your life, you will need to have a different attitude toward your work-outs. This DVD will help you achieve that goal with a perfect blend of whole-body strength, flexibility and grace.",1262822400,,1317,4.746724890829694
2902001,4,B000TJ6P5Q,"This workout is designed to ""refresh and rejuvenate your entire body,"" as instructor Emily Welsh puts it. I think it does do just that. It's a lot of stretching and light weight lifting so that you are conditioning your body, but not putting as much stress on your muscles as you do in the other FIRM workouts.

The title is poorly chosen-""Cardio Sculpt Fusion"" makes me think of a more intense workout. However, I would not consider this workout a waste of money. On days when I feel sore or sluggish, it's really nice and refreshing. Even though it's a low-impact workout, I still manage to break into a sweat every time!:)",1251936000,4,625,4.580357142857143
2902002,4,B000TJ6P5Q,"It is disconcerting that Emily says, ""Welcome to Total Body Lite,"" and ""You've just completed Total Body Lite.""  Maybe they thought the ""lite"" would scare people off?

Well, it worked with me.  I would not have purchased a DVD called ""Total Body Lite"" as I normally am a pretty hard-core exerciser.  If you enjoy the intensity of regular Firm videos, this might not be for you.

However . . . I recently was ill and didn't work out for several weeks, then found out I was pregnant.  Due to the bun in the oven, I figure it's not the time to try to work back up to my fitness of two months ago.  So I looked through my collection and found my unwrapped ""Cardio Sculpt Fusion.""

It's not as easy to follow the first time as some other Firm videos, partly because the focus on Yoga incorporates new moves that old Firmies don't already know, and partly because Emily doesn't always give warning or an adequate description for the changes she's adding.  But with all Firm videos, once you've done it a few times, that's a non-issue.

There is a lot of stretching and you never use more than 6 pounds at a time (one 5 lb dumbell or two 3 lb. dumbells).  Emily is pregnant in the video, and I honestly think that they just didn't want to bill this as a pregnancy workout because heaven forbid somebody claim to have suffered a problem from it.  I don't see myself doing this video for ""muscle recovery.""  On non-weights days, I'd rather do a cardio-oriented video like The Ultimate Fat Burning Workout or go for a run.  I don't need a normal Firm video lite.  But it's just what I was looking for today, and I plan to do it often throughout my pregnancy.",1235088000,2,1648,4.375

Emily is a very motivating & competent instructor. She takes you through each step in the traditional Firm build-on fashion. This workout is designed to be used for an 'active rest day' or a 'recovery workout' after you've done the intense exercises the day before.
