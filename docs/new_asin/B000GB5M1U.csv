2604160,4,B000GB5M1U,"With Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot and Helen Hayes as Miss Marple, these are delightful little mysteries with the supporting cast of stars that makes them worth viewing.  With stars of the magnitude of Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Faye Dunaway and Tony Curtis, plus an array of TV favorites such as Jean Stapleton, Tony Randall, Bill Bixby and Jameson Parker, Agatha Christie fans shouldn't miss this DVD set.  The only problem with the eight-set is that An Appointment with Death wasn't included, one of the better Christie films with Peter Ustinov and Lauren Bacall.  Alas, we can but wait impatiently for the straggler to be released on DVD as a single.",1167868800,10,663,4.901785714285714
2604161,5,B000GB5M1U,"What a treat to have some of the worlds favorites sleuths such as Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot, and Colonel Race all in one collection of eight mysteries.  And Agatha Christie doesn't disappoint with exciting mysteries such as Murder in Three Acts, The Man in the Brown Suit, Murder is Easy, and Thirteen to Dinner.  It's a pleasure just spending time with some of the great actors that have given so much pleasure to so many over the years such as Helen Hayes, Peter Ustinov,  Olivia de Havilland, Tony Curtis, Jean Stapleton,  Bill Bixby, Tony Randall and so many more.",1163116800,11,570,4.7272727272727275
2604162,5,B000GB5M1U,"This collection of 8 American(!!!) TV movies is a real treat for Christie fans. And it proves that we can honor the First Lady of Mystery on this side of the Pond just as well as her fellow Brits. Not all 8 are perfect gems, but they sure get an A for effort. With 2-time Oscar-winners Helen Hayes and Peter Ustinov as Miss Marple and Poirot, backed up by an impressive crowd of A-list film and TV stars, who could complain?

Extra treat for American mystery fans: 2 of these films--A CARIBBEAN MYSTERY and SPARKLING CYANIDE--were written by our own national treasure of mysterydom, Sue Grafton, and her husband, Steven Humphrey. Sue went on to prove with her Kinsey Millhone ""alphabet"" series (""A"" IS FOR ALIBI, ""B"" IS FOR BURGLAR, etc.) that she is a true ""daughter"" of Christie.

And it's a delight to see established stars like Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Tony Curtis, and Faye Dunaway mixing it up with newer talents like Stephanie Zimbalist, Jameson Parker, Anthony Andrews, and Lesley Anne Down. And let's not forget Sir John Mills, Maurice Evans, Tim Roth, Bill Bixby, Jean Stapleton, Edward Woodward, Brock Peters, Tony Randall, Rue McClanahan, Jonathan Pryce, and David Suchet (as Inspector Japp in 13 AT DINNER, long before he went on to play Poirot). Whew! But the real treasures here are the stories themselves--8 of the cleverest mysteries ever written, well-served (for the most part) by several generations of our finest entertainers. And the slim packaging is especially elegant. Curl up in front of your TV and enjoy!

PS: The popularity of these films when they first aired led directly to CBS's decision to do MURDER, SHE WROTE--yet another reason to be thankful for them.",1161907200,29,1698,4.868512110726644
2604163,5,B000GB5M1U,"I saw some of these on TV when they first came out, and I have to tell you this set is well worth the price.  First, we get Helen Hayes twice as Miss Marple and once as the victim with my old childhood hero Bill Bixby as the sleuth.  Then we get 3 of the 6 mysteries with the only native born Russian to become a knight of the British Empire, Sir Peter Ustinov as Poirot (the other 3, 2 are available on Lion's Gate (older copies on Anchor Bay when I wrote this originally and 1 on MGM but only in England: Region 2).  Watch for soon to be popular British TV star David Suchet on London Weekend Television's (PBS & A&E here) version of Poirot soon after, in one of these films, but as Japp.  Finally, 2 other Christie Classics: Sparkling Cyanide and The Man In The Brown Suit, all with all star casts.  Interesting to note, that the Hayes and Ustinov sets can be bought as separate items as well, but these latter 2 appear NOT to be available separately.  If you wanna complete this great collection, I recommend the fore mentioned 3 pack by Lion's Gate with the other 2 Ustinovs available here (Evil Under The Sun and Death on The Nile) and Angela Lansbury (pre Murder She Wrote) as Miss Marple in The Mirror Cracked.  These 3 are also available separately, but side by side these 2  multi disc sets would look great together.  If you wanna see how ""it was done"" before Suchet and Hickson told us, buy these films.:-)",1158364800,43,1418,4.3007518796992485
2604164,5,B000GB5M1U,"I'm so thrilled to hear about Agatha Christie Movies coming out on DVD in a Collection Box set of Eight enjoyable Agatha Christie movies - I loved watching A Caribbean Mystery, Murder With Mirrors, Murder Is Easy, Dead Man's Folly, Murder in Three Acts, Thirteen at Dinner, Sparkling Cynaide and The Man In The Brown Suit.  I will add these eight movies to my Agatha Christie DVD Collection.  Can't Wait for this collection to be released on September 12th.  I loved the box cover Artwork.  The Actors are superb to watch Peter Ustinov, Helen Hayes, Bill Bixby, Jean Stapleton, Bette Davis and many others to give wonderful performances in their roles in my favorite agatha christie movies.",1155859200,19,690,4.871794871794871
2604165,5,B000GB5M1U,"This is a collection of previously unreleased (on DVD) dramatizations of original Christie novels.  Some of these were on VHS tape in the past.  There is a variety of actors and actresses.  Some of these are the only available dramatizations.  Others are earlier dramatizations that were later done by Hickson.

6 of the 8 programs are true to the original novels.  The characters are cultured and refined.  The one about the brown suit is dismal.  They have taken a 1924 novel plot and loosely translated it to 1985.  The women are airhead bimbos and the men arrogant incompetents.

Sparkling Cyanide is updated from 1945 to 1975.  This includes women who make themselve look flat chested and wear baggy clothes which were all the rage in 1975 and with turned up collars which were as ugly then as they are now.  Otherwise the plot is mostly true to the novel.

Conspicuous by their absence is ""The ABC Murders"" and ""Appointment With Death"" which I consider superior to the two previously mentioned dramatizations.",1152835200,16,1015,4.8654970760233915

The films are full of great stars, great plot twists, and the 80's hair and costumes are worth the price alone.",1436745600,6,439,4.301204819277109

She loved each of the movies, watching them over the course of only a week.  My review is based upon her comments to me, as well as my observations from watching Murder with Mirrors.  The films were good and kept my attention, but unlike the Poirot TV series staring David Suchet, they were kind of dated (you could tell they were filmed in the 80's).",1433548800,5,503,4.387096774193548

2604204,5,B000GB5M1U,"I love Agatha Christie Mysteries and I love Helen Hayes. Now days you don't see good acting as in years past. This collection is worth the price. Included in this package is: A string of murders rocks an English village, and it's up to a visiting American computer expert to catch the killer, in ""Murder Is Easy"" (1982); Bill Bixby, Helen Hayes star. A vacation becomes ""A Caribbean Mystery"" (1983) for septuagenarian sleuth Miss Jane Marple (Hayes) when she must solve the murder of a retired British army officer. What starts out as an elegant society party turns into a double murder, in ""Sparkling Cyanide"" (1983), with Anthony Andrews. Hayes is Miss Marple in ""Murder With Mirrors"" (1985), coming to the aid of an old friend (Bette Davis) who thinks someone is trying to kill her. The death of an actress's husband brings Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) into the world of filmmaking, in ""Thirteen At Dinner"" (1985). Poirot (Ustinov) is tapped to help plan a mystery game, but a real murder occurs, in ""Dead Man's Folly"" (1986). A reverend and a doctor are poisoned in Acapulco, and Poirot (Ustinov) must prevent a third death, in ""Murder In Three Acts"" (1986). And an American woman caught up in a Middle Eastern diamond heist, in ""The Man In The Brown Suit"" (1989), with Rue McClanahan.",1408406400,7,1291,4.79372197309417

It's probably a bit unfair to compare the two, but I do like seeing how actors interpret the same character.  I much prefer Hickson's They Do It With Mirrors to the Hayes production; I just didn't find it lively enough for my taste.

2604218,3,B000GB5M1U,"These are mediocre telling of Agatha Christie stories.  And as the description states, they are made for TV, not theatrical releases.  ""Made for British TV"" does not mean they are the quality usually found on BBC productions.  They are typical of the 80's made for TV movies with the TV stars of the day.  Helen Hays and Peter Ustinov are the exceptions when I refer to ""stars"".  I have yet to view all the movies but most if not all seem to take place in the present day (80's) rather than the period of the Christie stories.  Considering you can get comparable acting and cinematography from a season of Columbo or McMillan for around $20, this series is horribly overpriced.",1335657600,,677,4.6

Conservative viewers BE WARNED: they were trying to stretch whatever immodesty that they could get away with on T.V. at that time.  A number of scattered scenes and wardrobe items were complete voyeurism.

2604221,4,B000GB5M1U,"This collection includes eight made-for-TV movies from the 1980s. Not all of these movies are keepers, but the good outweighs the bad. Ranking them from (in my opinion) best to worst, they are:

Murder with Mirrors - Miss Marple visits an old friend whose husband runs a reformatory for juvenile delinquents. What ensues is a nice cozy mystery with a bit of gentle humor. This is probably the most faithful adaptation in the bunch, and it's one of the best. Bette Davis is great as Carrie Louise, and a young Tim Roth costars as one of the delinquents.

Thirteen for Dinner - American actress Jane Wilkinson announces her intention to murder her husband, and two days later he's dead. Coincidence? Faye Dunaway's performance as Jane makes this one worth watching. There are a few attempts to modernize the story; some are bad (Poirot on a talk show?), and some actually work (the ridiculous action movie Jane is filming). Plus, David Suchet costars as Inspector Japp!

A Caribbean Mystery - Miss Marple visits a vacation resort with a surprisingly high mortality rate. This is a pretty faithful adaptation; it's a little dull, honestly, but then so was the book. Bernard Hughes is fun as the cranky Mr. Rafiel, and Brock Peters appears in a small role.

Murder in Three Acts - Poirot attends a dinner party thrown by famous actor Charles Cartwright, and one of the guests is killed by a poisoned cocktail. A lot of details have been changed from the book - the house party is in Mexico, Hastings replaces Mr. Satterthwaite - and most changes are not for the better. Poirot's humor is too broad, and there's absolutely no suspense. Still, Tony Curtis is fun as Charles. Besides, the adaptation with David Suchet has the British ending (yes, there are actually two different endings to this book), so this might be your only chance to see a movie with the American ending.

Murder Is Easy - A visitor to a small English village gets caught up in multiple murders. This movie has aged the worst of the lot, because someone had the brilliant idea of replacing Luke Fitzwilliam, ex-policeman, with Luke Williams, American computer programmer and probability theorist. What ensues is a lot of ridiculousness and early eighties computer tech, including a hilarious computer program designed to catch the murderer after about five keystrokes. (What, no punch cards?) Bill Bixby and Lesley-Anne Down have an almost aggressive lack of chemistry as the ""romantic"" leads, and Jonathan Pryce and Freddie Jones randomly pop up as creepy and/or cranky villagers. This is not a good movie by any means, but the sheer silliness of it is amusing.

Sparkling Cyanide - A woman dies at a dinner party, and her sister must figure out which of their dinner companions killed her. If you ever thought that Agatha Christie's novel needed a good water-skiing sequence, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, this is a fairly dull (but largely faithful) version, with Anthony Andrews and Deborah Raffin as the bland detectives. This one mostly annoys me because every single woman in the movie has poofy, feathered blond hair, so it's sometimes hard to keep track of who's who. Harry Morgan pops up as the police detective, which is odd but fun.

Dead Man's Folly - Mystery writer Ariadne Oliver enlists Poirot's help when the murder game that she's planning turns all too real. This movie suffers from a number of bad decisions, including hiring Jean Stapleton to play Mrs. Oliver. Yes, really: Edith Bunker is playing Agatha Christie's alter ego. Other than that, this movie telegraphs its solution way too soon, and the twinkly, ""sweet"" music that plays every time we see Hattie is beyond annoying. Hastings is in this one, too, for absolutely no reason at all.

The Man in the Brown Suit - Anne Beddingfeld stumbles across an international crime syndicate and falls for the lead suspect in a murder. This is by far the weakest movie of the lot; the casting is just terrible (except for Edward Woodward, who's fun as Sir Eustace), and everyone seems to think that they're far cuter than they actually are. The novel featured a character who's a master of disguise; I realize that it's hard to pull that off on film, but they could have started by not hiring Tony Randall. Seriously, he's the worst master of disguise ever, because he always looks like Tony Randall, and Anne is a massive idiot for not figuring that out.",1297728000,5,4401,4.819867549668874
2604222,2,B000GB5M1U,"This is perhaps the first time for me that Amazon reviews have been totally amiss. This series is a set of poor adaptations of the original christie novels, which are set in 1930. The sets are cheap, the actors second grade and stellar performers like Bette Davis wasted in guest roles. The only saving grace are Helen Hayes as Miss Marple and Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot. Most of the episodes drag unbearably with lot of drama, no music or slickness in direction and no real backbone to any character. The David Suchet series is highly superior and worth keeping compared to this. Am waiting to get rid of my set, total waste of money.",1291248000,4,640,4.573913043478261
2604223,5,B000GB5M1U,"And it won't necessarily be because they are the most accurate versions you've seen.  If you love Agatha Christie, you've probably read and know the outcome of these tales already, but that doesn't matter.  You've even arguably seen better characterizations of Poirot, Marple et al. on PBS.  However, that will not stop you from thoroughly enjoying the movies in this collection.  The first thing you'll notice is that all of the stories have been ""modified"" to a more modern time (1980's that is), and do not take place in the 1930's-50's when the stories were actually written.  Don't let that bother you - sit back and enjoy some of Hollywood's great well-known ""stars"" put a new spin on Agatha's classics!",1252454400,6,709,4.875
2604224,3,B000GB5M1U,"Peter Ustinov is way too untidy to be Poirot but these stories are good none the less, if just a little bit long winded. I still prefer Joan Hickson as Miss Marple too but since some of these haven't been redone, they're good to have in the collection. They stick fairly close to the book, unlike the new 'Marple' abominations.",1251158400,5,327,4.466666666666667

2604226,1,B000GB5M1U,These are the worst Agatha Christie movies i have seen.  I did not want to even give a star.  i WOULD LIKE TO GET my money back if possible.  I cannot bear to watch the rest of them.  They do not have the class as the other movies have .  I will ONLY WATCH THE first type of movies i brought with Hercule Piroit  as the leading person. Money wasted.,1218412800,5,349,3.914285714285714
2604227,4,B000GB5M1U,Helen Hayes is still my favorite Miss Marple she brings a high spirit to the role that is lacking in other productions yet carries off the little old lady knitting all the time well .  very enjoyable.,1218412800,5,200,4.405405405405405
2604228,5,B000GB5M1U,"I love Agatha Christie movies and books.  Poirot is always the favorite, especially when it's Peter Ustinov.  Helen Heyes is a wonderful Marple.  This collection is a ""must have"" for all Agatha Christie fans.  My only disappointment was with ""Murder Is Easy"".  The description of DVD set leads you to believe this is Miss Marple, but it isn't.  Helen Heyes is playing another character and is only briefly involved.  Bill Bixby is the sleuth in this movie.  The movie itself is still very good and very exciting--just not with Miss Marple.",1193702400,4,539,4.846153846153846
2604229,4,B000GB5M1U,"If you are as big a fan of mysteries and of old Hollywood stars as I am then this set is a must for you. You get Peter Ustinov, Jean Stapleton, Faye Dunaway, Bette Davis, Lesley Anne Down, Tony Randall, Tony Curtis, and my personal favorite--Helen Hayes--just to name a few! Some of my favorites are ""Murder with Mirrors with Helen Hayes and Bette Davis, and ""Dead Man's Folly"" with Peter Ustinov and Jean Stapleton. Jean Stapleton is a riot in this one. She really steals the show!

But I must admit that the stars are probably the best part of these Warner Bros. productions. It's just a shame that with such great actors the producers didn't get better scripts and directors. The weakest of the lot is probably ""Murder in Three Acts"", with Tony Curtis. The dialogue is weak and the scenes very choppy and hard to follow. Some of these stories like ""Sparkling Cyanide"" have been messed with so much that there is very little resemblance to Christie's original story! But if you like mysteries and want to see some great old Hollywood stars (especially Helen Hayes) then you will enjoy this set.",1187827200,17,1096,4.62051282051282

It is far too easy to find things that are very offensive and unwholesome.  These are all well done, clean, and typical Agatha Christie, exciting and thrilling.  She is one of the best mystery writers around and it is good to see some of her classics done so well.  Keep up the good work!!!",1186185600,6,459,4.218390804597701

2604232,2,B000GB5M1U,"These 8 made for TV films are among the weakest modern Christie offerings.  Any of the PBS versions are preferable.

Christie fans should look elsewhere for satisfying film versions.",1184112000,5,360,4.3283582089552235
