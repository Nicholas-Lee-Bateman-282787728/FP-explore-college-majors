2625385,5,B000H1RFXM,"I would definitely say this is a must buy for a lot of people.  Three's Company is the kind of series that is timeless and can be enjoyed by just about anyone.  Unlike a lot of other DVD sets, this one is also very affordable.

A lot of people argue which combination of characters was the best, but I really like this group.  I personally think Terri is a lot more classy and attractive than the Chrissy character ever was, and by season 8, Don Knotts was hitting his stride as Mr. Furley.  I also liked Janet's eventual husband and Jack's girlfriend although I think those characters would have been better developed over more than the few episodes they ended up appearing in.

Still, you can't go wrong with this or any other season and it wouldn't break the bank of most people to actually own all 8.",1159228800,3,804,4.398648648648648
2625386,5,B000H1RFXM,"This is the eighth and final season of Three's Company. To begin the season, Jack's girlfriend(played by Joanna Kerns) wants him to father her child, although he believes at first that she wants him to marry her. Another misunderstanding  is in the second episode when Jack reads a magazine quiz which has been filled out, and concludes that one of the girls is in love with him, but as it turns out, the magazine belongs to a patient of Terri's at the hopital. Some other moments include: Jack and Terri and Janet and Larry posing as married couples to ward off the romantic advances of Terri's boss, the trio believing that an Englishman who has moved in next door is a murderer(although he is really a ventriloquist), Jack waking up with a tattoo on his derriere, and Jack faking amnesia after totalling Janet's car. I know that by this season, the writers found it difficult to come up with original storylines. This is particularly evident in the episode ""Look What I Found,"" where the trio tries to hide a kitten from Mr. Furley, which is reminiscent of the season 1 episode ""No Children, No Dogs,"" when they try to hide a puppy from Mr. Roper. The last few episodes of this season mark the transition into the spin-off series ""Three's A Crowd."" Janet meets her future husband Philip Dawson at the reading of the will for his uncle, who was also one of Janet's customers at the flower shop. Jack then meets Vicky Bradford, a stewardess who will become his live-in girlfriend, and her opinionated father. In the final one hour episode titled ""Friends and Lovers,"" Janet and Philip marry, Terri moves to Hawaii, and Jack and Vicky move in together. The transition into ""Three's A Crowd"" was very difficult behind the scenes as the new series was developed in secret, and the girls were left out of the new series as Jack was the only character being spun off. Nevertheless, an absolutely classic season and classic series. I am hopeful that ""The Ropers,"" and ""Three's A Crowd"" will be released on DVD soon.",1159056000,6,2010,4.677966101694915
2625387,5,B000H1RFXM,"I can't wait for this set to arrive.  I'm praying that Anchor Bay will quickley have available The Ropers,Threes a Crowd, and a collection of Bloopers only.  Please Anchor Bay, make all that's left available.  We're waiting to buy them so we can hold John Ritter close to our hearts.  There's never going  to be another like him.",1158364800,8,329,4.603448275862069
2625388,5,B000H1RFXM,I remember this series when it originally aired in the 70s.  I was close to the same age of the characters.  30 years later they still have me practically rolling on the fall with laughter.  There has never been a series since that has been so funny.  I think the Terrie Alden character was an excellent replacement for the Crissy character.  I didn't care for Crissy's klutzy cousin who moved in with Jack and Janet for a short time.  I was glad when she moved out. I am currently watching Season 7 and can't wait to see Season 8 although I will be a little sad since it's the last Season.  Never did care too much for Three's a Crowd. I guess a lot of people didn't care for it either or it would have lasted longer than one season.,1157760000,11,734,4.2
2625389,5,B000H1RFXM,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE CONTINUE TO BRING US MORE OF WHAT WE LOVE! PLEASE PRODUCE DVD'S OF ""THE ROPERS"" SERIES AND ""THREE'S A CROWD"" SERIES AS WELL! THERE IS A DEMAND!",1156636800,59,164,4.5
2625390,5,B000H1RFXM,"Here it is, the eighth and final season of Three's Company! I'm certain that everyone reading this is quite familiar with the exploits of the characters and the quality of this series, so I'm not going to waste everyone's time with a ""review"" that rehashes all the details or lists episodes or plot outlines.

I would like to take a moment to thank ANCHOR BAY for releasing all eight seasons QUICKLY and with all the care and attention to detail that they deserved! Every box set has been packaged with great cover designs and photo's. The discs themselves have contained high quality transfers of the episiodes as well as a healthy amount of EXTRA content. Anyone wanting to collect this series on DVD will be quite happy with EVERY set in this collection!

How lucky have we been? Just look around at some of the other TV series being released and some of the problems encountered! ""Too close for comfort"", season one contained edited SYNDICATED VERSIONS (a total slap in the face!). ""Lavern & Shirley"" and ""Night Court"" are STILL on season ONE. The ""Greatest American Hero"" had major chunks removed or re-dubbed because of music copyrights practically ruining a few of the episodes. ""Kung Fu"" season one was formatted to wide-screen when it was NEVER intended to be viewed that way (chopping off 25% of the screen content!). And of course, the great ""WKRP"" is still in LIMBO! These are all examples of what could have gone wrong with these releases and I thank ANCHOR BAY for getting it RIGHT every step of the way! Other production companies would do well to examine these box sets before they mess up another DVD release!

I'm sure that our Three's Company DVD collection will NOT end here with THIS release! ANCHOR BAY will continue to do what is right and release ""the Ropers"" and ""Three's a Crowd"" on DVD as well! I know we're all waiting and ready to buy! Perhaps they'll release them as a COMBO box... both series in one box set?

At any rate, thanks ANCHOR BAY and thanks to the cast and writers of Three's Company!

2625391,5,B000H1RFXM,"Well, Ever since we all got the complete first season set back in the fall of 2003, we have all patiently been waiting for season 8 to come out.  After almost exactly 3 years, here it is: The Complete Eight Season.  Jack and Janet both meet the love of their lives.  Jack continues to cook for ""poeple who can afford it"" At his bistro. BUt most importantly, the three finally move out of the apartment and get on with their lives.

The last season had it all (except good ratings.  This was the first year when the show wasn't even in the top 20, or even the top 30) Enjoy this four disc set, with great bonus features, including:

*Over 10 minutes of Never-Before-seen bloopers from seasons 6-8

*Usted Habla Three's Company?

2625392,5,B000H1RFXM,"Here are the final adventures of apartment 201 and its occupants Jack Tripper(the late John Ritter),Janet Wood(Joyce DeWitt) and Terri Alden(Priscilla Barnes). Highlights from the final season which premiered on ABC on September 27,1983 include Jack,Terri,Janet and their upstairs neighbor Larry Dallas(Richard Kline) on a weekend getaway in the mountains. Jack suspected either Terri or Janet planned to have an affair with him(a similar situation occurred during season 4). Jack's Bistro is visited by a restaurant critic and because the critic only sampled one of the Bistro's entrees,Jack thought the restaurant was gonna close down(the critic does give Jack's Bistro a  great review). The trio's couch on its last leg is replaced by landlord Ralph Furley(the late Don Knotts). Jack on a dinner date with a female,married but separated,reporter(she wants to have a baby with him). Larry pretending to be Jack to impress Janet's friend Agnes Platt(guest appearance by Rita Wilson). Janet terrified of Jack's therapist girlfriend(after seeing the word ""therapist"" on the girlfriend's business card,Janet read it as ""the rapist""!). Jack,entered in a cooking contest as ""Grandma Tripper"" by Larry(the contest was only open to women). Jack's father visiting the trio(guest appearance by the late Dick Shawn). Terri,a nurse at Wilshire Memorial Hospital and about to receive a promotion,is sexually harrassed by her married male boss(the boss and his wife are dinner guests and respectively,Terri and Jack and Janet and Larry pretend to be husband and wife). Jack is at a lavish casino party given by his girlfriend's father. An English ventriloquist named Leslie Bennington moves in next door to the trio(his character is similar to Paul Benedict's Harry Bentley on CBS's The Jeffersons). Janet finally quits her job at Arcade Florists to teach aerobics(she started as a student then was promoted to instructor). Jack is visited,at first on separate occasions,by two high school classmates who are now husband and wife and the husband believes his wife is cheating on him. The trio and Ralph are dinner guests at the couple's home. Jack and Ralph are locked in the freezer of Jack's former workplace,Angelino's restaurant. Jack,with permission from his former boss(seen in one episode this season,but not this one),stores a side of beef in the freezer while the restaurant is closed for vacation. A robber steals Jack's wallet and Ralph's cash and wrist watch,all later surrendered by order of the policeman who arrested the robber. The trio temporarily take in a stray cat that belongs to a little girl(she later decides to surrender it so Ralph takes it into his care-only he's allowed to have pets). Jack is one of Terri's patients when he has an unwanted tattoo on his derriere removed(it reads ""the love butt""-courtesy of Jack's old navymates at a reunion). Another new next door neighbor,a saxophonist and art teacher paints Jack in the nude. Jack takes a figure drawing class given by the neighbor and after class,she composes the sketch. Ralph enrolls in the class also,because it was free. Jack has an accident with Janet's new car and fakes amnesia to avoid a personal injury from Janet. Janet meets her future husband Philip Dawson at a willreading(one of Janet's male customers,Philip's uncle,passed away and he bequested her one of his treasured vases). Then there's the prelude to the spinoff Three's a Crowd which was the series finale. Ritter's new castmates Mary Cadorette as flight attendant Vicki Bradford and Soap veteran Robert Mandan as Vicki's father James Bradford are guest stars in the series finale. Also,there's the wedding of Janet and Philip held in the apartment(unfortunately Janet's parents were unable to make it). Terri moves to Hawaii to work at another hospital there. So,Jack,Janet and Terri all bid apartment 201 adieu at the same time. Jack and his new girlfriend Vicki move into a new apartment above Jack's Bistro. James purchases the property from Frank Angelino who was Jack's Jack's Bistro landlord. ""Say hello to your new landlord!"",James tells his daughter and her new boyfriend with a key in James' hand. Jack Tripper continued for one more season in the not-too-popular spinoff. I dedicate this item to the memories of Ritter(September 17,1948-September 11,2003) and Knotts(July 21,1924-February 24,2006).",1154217600,11,4353,5.308695652173913

2625475,3,B000H1RFXM,"Season 8 was the last of Three's Company and at this point was already in the pre-stages of The John Ritter Show. The original trio were equals in the company as stars, even though John got paid the most. However, when Suzanne was fired, the show took a turn and became less company. Season 6 was a good season and the first episodes portrayed Priscilla Barnes in a good light and as a potential equal to Suzanne Somers. However, Seasons 7 and 8 might as well had Priscilla as a supporting character like Larry and Mr. Furley. Priscilla's screen time was reduced and there were more Jack and Janet solo stories without Terri. It was only years later through an interview with Priscilla, the audience learned she was unhappy with the show and voiced she wanted to leave to the producers. As a result of her punishment, her screen time was minimized and her salary was cut. What a waste of talent. The shows started to show more time at Jack's Bistro and featured more episodes around Jack as a cook. The other girls were merely decorations. Joyce DeWitt, even though I don't like her because she attacks Suzanne Somers, was a gifted actress. However, she did not have the star appeal as Suzanne Somers and did not have clout with the producers for better story lines. As a result, the Janet storylines were minimum compared to the Jack storylines. So, the producers with all these changes made have decided the show could go on with John Ritter without the girls. However, if most of the audience were like me, they were always happy to see the girls back in a scene. Don't get me wrong John Ritter was a legend and a talented actor. However, Three's Company stopped being company after Season 7. It was already The John Ritter Show. As a result, the producers treated Joyce Dewitt and Priscilla Barnes, who probably could care less staying on the show, like crap. The producers lied to Joyce about major changes being made to the show and waited until the last minute to tell Joyce that she would no longer have a job. The final episode was a preseason of Three's A Crowd. I have to sympathized with Joyce on how badly she was treated and don't understand why John would allow Joyce to be treated so badly. As a result, Joyce left Hollywood and traveled the world seeking true spirituality. Three's A Crowd failed because the supporting actors were not as gifted as Joyce Dewitt and Priscilla Barnes. In my opinion, the show should have ended after Season 5, when Suzanne left and John Ritter should have made a new show all together without being the Jack Tripper character. Anyway, if you have Seasons 1-7. Buy Season 8.",1233705600,13,2622,4.59275053304904

There are certain innuendos made but I personally think that it is still good clean fun and this is true entertainment.

2625478,5,B000H1RFXM,"After eight years of pratfalls and wacky misunderstandings, the roommates say goodbye to Mr. Furley and Apartment 201. Jack moves into the apartment over his restaurant with girlfriend Vicky, while Janet gets married and Terri takes a job in Hawaii.

Before that, however, there are still plenty of the usual roommate problems, romantic entanglements and workplace woes that made this show's standard fare. They manage to be both familiar and new at the same time, so viewers can anticipate the likely outcome in a particular situation while not feeling that anything's *too* predictable.

Classic episodes include Jack's getting locked into the restaurant meat freezer with Mr. Furley and, believing them close to death, blurting out the truth about his sexual orientation, and Jack's infatuation with a pretty art teacher, who asks him to model nude for her students.

All shows must come to an end, and eight years is certainly a great run. Still, it's hard not to wish it hadn't ended, as this was truly the end of an era in classic comedy.",1201651200,4,1044,4.988505747126437

2625490,5,B000H1RFXM,Three's Company was an awesome show and I also hope that they release both Three's A Crowd and The Ropers on DVD. I have all 8 seasons and would definitely purchase the spin-offs without hesitation.,1162512000,2,198,4.685714285714286

2625492,5,B000H1RFXM,"The last season of Three's Company was just as funny and heart-tugging as the other seasons. This season has the episode where Janet gets Jack and Terri over to the exercise gym where the mabager of the gym has the hots for Jack. I also like the episode where Terri makes up one lie after another to keep from spending time with her boss because she thinks he has the hots for her (he does!). This is also the season where Jack falls in love with Vicki and Janet meets her soon to be husband Phillip.

I was impressed with the on screen chemistry between Jack and Vicki, and with the frumpy arrogance of Mr. Bradford.

I have always preferred Mr. Furley to the Ropers and Terri to Chrissy and Cindy, and I enjoyed their roles in this last season. I especially appreciated Larry's comic timing.

One tiny bit of criticism: The cellophane wrapping has a sticker which says that the 30th anniversary of Three's Company is included with this set, but it is not. And the bloopers for season eight were not all that funny. But these minor things aside, this is a beautifully packaged boxed set (just like most of the other seasons, save for the plain box holding season one). Now let us hope that Anchor Bay will release the brief spinoff Three's a Crowd.",1160870400,3,1249,4.469298245614035
2625493,5,B000H1RFXM,"Thank you Anchor Bay for releasing the entire run in a reasonable time as well as for packaging each season attractively and including extras.  Your efforts are certainly appreciated.

I've said it in other reviews for other 3's Company seasons, but I'll say it again: John Ritter was a true television pioneer for physical comedy.  Before him, no one did the things he did (though John did credit Lucille Ball as the true pioneer).  The plots are simplistic, true.  Double entendres, misunderstandings, and physical comedy ruled the roost.  But at the center of the show was heart; the three roommates really loved each other and cared for one another.

This season continued more of the same scenarios as the previous ones while culminating, of course, with Jack falling for Vicky, Janet marrying, and the spinoff show, Three's A Crowd.  Like many fans, I felt ripped off by the cheap wedding Janet gotand the lack of familiar faces that attended it.  So, the final episode was anti-climatic, but the episode where Janet met her husband-to-be, Phil, was classic Three's Company.

It is nice to see Joyce Dewitt and John's first wife reminiscing about John Ritter the actor and man.  I still wish Priscilla Barnes and Suzanne Somers would have contributed something.  They didn't and that is our loss.

Overall, each season was released in a manner befitting a classic comedy show which is still re-running all over the world.  Every season is well worth getting.",1160265600,7,1464,4.94672131147541
2625494,5,B000H1RFXM,"Anchor Bay has once again done a fabulous job bringing another season, this time the final one, of Three's Company to fruition. The question I (and many others) now ask is, ""What happens next?""

I always considered the 8th season of the show to be somewhat depressing as it marks the end of my favorite television series. While watching Three's Company in syndication over the years during my youth, I eventually got used to watching the series finale only to be followed by the very first episode the next day. I would always cross my fingers hoping for a few episodes of Three's A Crowd - in hopes of letting the show go on, but that never happened. I went as far as paying an enormous amount of money on eBay for some bootlegged episodes of Three's A Crowd (and The Roper's) on VHS when I realized I'd probably never see those two shows again. But Anchor Bay brings renewed faith that both shows will be released on DVD. Not only would it make sense - considering Three's Company has been one of the best-selling DVD series to date, but also because there has become quite a cult-following for the release of these two spin-offs on DVD. While many avid Three's Company fans have never even seen an episode of Three's A Crowd and The Roper's, I must say that there is a *LOT* of interest in both shows, regardless.

The difference between me dreaming that TBS would air a few episodes of these two spin-offs and Anchor Bay actually releasing these two shows is that the former is a company that aired Three's Company in horrible syndication - cutting out 2-3 minutes of scenes from each episode to fill the voids with repetitive commercials, while the latter has brought back these ""missing"" scenes that haven't been seen since the original airings some 30 years ago. Which leads me to believe that Anchor Bay seems to be paying attention to what the viewers and fans want by releasing all 8 seasons in such a quick manner, by filling each season with extra features, and by allowing fans alike to re-live all those laughable scenes that the gang brought us in each episode!

I'm quite confident that in due time, we'll see the two spin-offs make their DVD debut on Anchor Bay!",1160006400,3,2179,4.567774936061381
