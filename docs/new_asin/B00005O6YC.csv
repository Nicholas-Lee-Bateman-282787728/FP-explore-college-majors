7948519,5,B00005O6YC,This 2-disc set provides excellent exercise routines for beginner to intermediate levels.  The instructor provides detailed instructions for all the movements.  There are trainers in the background performing the exercises for the beginner to intermediate levels.  I would recommend this Pilates Method disc set to anyone who prefers to workout at home.,1365033600,,353,5.75
7948520,2,B00005O6YC,Her other earlier videos were much better.  I don't seem to see the same results or feel the same energy with these.,1239753600,,116,4.2727272727272725
7948521,4,B00005O6YC,"These DVDs aren't perfect, yet they remain some of my favorites.  Jennifer's cueing is off at times and I do wish she'd explain more physiology (which I know she knows).

I find her workouts very relaxing and calming.(even the ""energizing"" ones.) I also find it very difficult to quit working out to her discs.  I tell myself I'm going to do a 30 min. session and once that one ends I just have to do the next one.  She makes it all feel so easy that you might not even realize how hard you've worked.  You get your muscles warmed up and might even break a sweat. But you'll feel it the next day.  And you'll notice it in the mirror.  They even helped me quit smoking after 20+ years. (yep, I started when I just a young ballerina, 13y/o!)

Definetly worth buying if you can get them at a good price.",1107216000,3,800,4.217105263157895
7948522,4,B00005O6YC,"The pilates method tape is a combination of yoga, resistance, light weights, stretching and the ""side series"".  The excercises moved quick  and I found this to be more yoga influenced rather than traditional pilates. I'm not sure if I am crazy about this tape yet.  I love The Method - Pilates- Precision Toning tape I have not yet done the 3 Dimensional Toning yet but ....we will see.",1046304000,,386,4.647058823529412
7948523,5,B00005O6YC,"This is a set of two (pilates, ballet and yoga influenced)videos. The first video is called 3 D toning which has a thirty minutes standing ballet/yoga section,which focuses on mainly hips and thighs,it then concludes,with twenty minutes of pilates mat core conditioning floorwork which concentrates on the abs and legs, this is my favorite video because it stretches me out and makes me feel elongated,flexible and like a dancer.
 The second video has twenty minutes of upper body toning with light weights for your arms and chest,it then moves on to the lower body sculpting for your legs,then finally concludes with a yoga type workout with classical dance and stretching.
I recommend this two pack, for overall toning,and to increase flexibility. It is a good beginner to intermediate tape, however the dance moves can be a bit confusing at first but I would suggest watching a few time first,because with practice it can become very enjoyable once you get the moves down.
Advanced could also do it on a light toning day but if you were looking for a pilates/dance type workout to challenge you, then I would suggest getting Pilates Perfect Mix by the same instructor.
ACTUALLY GET ALL THREE!! if you love fusions you won't regret it.",1036022400,13,1237,4.91866028708134
7948524,5,B00005O6YC,"I had the Pilates Perfect Mix DVD and decided to add these videos to my workout because I liked the other so much and was getting great results.  Each of these videos offers a different type of pilates training and used together, I am now able to make a different workout each day depending on what I want to concentrate on.  I love all 3 videos and am very happy with the results of toning, cardiovascular and stretch.",1015459200,62,419,4.358974358974359
