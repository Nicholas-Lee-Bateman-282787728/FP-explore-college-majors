487534,5,6302605016,"""The Naked Edge"" is one of my favorite Gary Cooper movies and I watch it from time to time, because I was lucky and recorded it late at night on German TV some 30 years ago. I transferred it to DVD 9 years ago to make it last longer and just watched it again last night. This is one thrilling movie, filmed in England and has you on the edge of your seat.
For 12 years I'm checking amazon.com on a yearly basis to see if ""The Naked Edge"" finally has been released on DVD, but nothing happens.
Every nonsense gets a DVD release, why not this rare gem? Gary Cooper's estate must be sleeping (or the movie production company who produced this film and has the rights to release it on DVD). With a little bit of advertising on amazon.com this film would sell very well!",1329264000,3,765,4.210884353741497
487535,2,6302605016,"The Naked Edge was Gary Cooper's last movie, which is what attracted me to it, he being my favorite actor.  The story has potential, but the movie focuses too much on the mood swings of Deborah Kerr on whether her husband (Cooper) is a criminal, which got tiresome to me.  I think the music and ambiguous shots (not knowing whether it's Cooper or another person walking, for instance) try too hard to create an effect of terror, which would probably be more effective if they were used more sparingly and the story clipped along at a faster pace.  It seems like it tries too hard to manipulate/persuade you.  It was probably an attempt to capitalize on the success of Psycho, which had come out the year before.  At least it didn't have the perverse content of Psycho (which I've never seen and don't intend to, due to its content).  (By the way, I've heard a little of the music of Psycho, and the music on The Naked Edge is probably intended to imitate it.  Also, the writer of The Naked Edge had adapted Psycho from a book to a movie.)",1315872000,,1038,4.431578947368421
487536,5,6302605016,"I had seen this film back in the 1960's and loved it, but had never known it to be on television.  I dedcided to see if it was available to buy, and was pleased to find it.  Excellent story with a twist at the end, rather reminescent of Hitchcock's work; suspenseful, with good performances by two of my favorite actors, Deborah Kerr and Gary Cooper.",1269216000,8,350,4.369230769230769

487538,5,6302605016,though the dvd is from spain it has an english sound-track and plays very well.  the plot is very good with enough twists and turns and edge-of-your seat suspense to keep you guessing almost till the very end of the movie.  excellent portrayals by each of the actors and actresses lead to the shattering climax.  a very definite must for any true collector.,1180742400,5,357,4.634920634920635
487539,5,6302605016,"Aside from being the great Gary Cooper's last film, ""The Naked Edge"", directed by Michael Anderson, is a fine suspense film with a terrific cast, including the great Deborah Kerr, Eric Portman, Diane Cilento, Hermione Gngold & Michael Wilding. A DVD, playable in America, is sorely missing, despite so much garbage that's out on disc. Where's the DVD? Anyone else agree...?",1176595200,15,373,5.131147540983607
487540,3,6302605016,"The film focuses too much on a miscast, cadaverous Gary Cooper. Deborah Kerr's character is interesting, but she looks bored throughout most of the film.  Eric Portman is delightfully evil and sinister. You will never view  bathtubs or razors the same way after the finale!",954979200,7,273,5.044444444444444
7828383,3,6302605016,"Noteworthy as Cooper's last film, reportedly rushed in production to release prior to his death, but regrettably was released posthumously due to rapid progression of Cooper's cancer. Reportedly Deborah Kerr and the producers knew he was dying and needed special considerations during filming. I believe that the necessity of hurried work with a seriously ill star hurt the final product, but at the same time is a testament to Cooper's courage and determination. Filmed in a very dark manner (unnecessarily dark in my opinion) with somewhat monotonous pacing but the suspense at the end is good. Kerr portrays a highly nervous and skittish character and Cooper's character does some really dumb things but both display fine acting- both are successful portrayals by great stars.",1494979200,3,779,5.290322580645161

7828390,5,6302605016,"I saw this movie a long time ago on TV. I don't think it gets shown much (although I think it comes around on TCM) and was glad to have found it again.

It is an excellent film for suspense and to see some great veteran actors strutting their stuff on screen. Look for:

Peter Cushing (of Hammer Horror fame)
Hermione Gingold (of GiGi fame)
Michael Wilding (The Egyptian, The Glass Slipper)
Sandor Elles (of Hammer Horror fame)
and of course,

Gary Cooper and Deborah Kerr.

Cooper  - who remains a strong sexy leading man even though this was his last film and he was getting up there in years -- plays a character who is strangely enigmatic. Did he kill his boss and rob his firm or not?

It's almost impossible to tell during the movie even as the facts are revealed.

Each time we think we know, something comes along to cast doubt. We can't be certain, but the circumstantial evidence looks pretty convincing which is why...

His wife, played by Deborah Kerr, is beginning to have doubts!

The film cleverly puts us, the audience, in her position and I didn't remember the ending when I saw this again, so I was guessing -- as was she -- unable to know for sure if hubby was the  bad guy or not.

The print i saw was a bit too dark, I remember it being brighter.

But if you like guessing and 'who done it', while this isn't a Hitchcock movie, it's very good and enjoyable.",1393632000,,1378,4.319066147859922
