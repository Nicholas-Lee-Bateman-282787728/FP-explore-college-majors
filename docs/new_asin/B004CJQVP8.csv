4327773,5,B004CJQVP8,"If you are familiar with these flicks, there is no need to rehash the plot as they are classics of the genre. I never post reviews but oddly enough I actually did a comparison of the American Ninja and Revenge of the Ninja ""OLD MGM DVD"" vs. ""3 Pack Action"" DVD and I found the following:

*While the new DVD (3 Pack) release is widescreen, it is certainly cropped on the top and bottom one reviewer suggested but does actually boast additional viewing area to left and right that was cropped off in the old MGM releases. So in other words - yes you lose a couple inches of scenery in the new release on the top and bottom, but the new release overall looks better and does not look stretched as the old releases did when I upscaled it on my DVD player. It is not true Anamorphic Widescreen, otherwise we'd have both the additional viewing area on the top and bottom of the old release and the additional area to the left and right on the new release.

For the price, it is worth double dipping even if you own one of the releases given the widescreen treatment and value to have all three in one package.",1322524800,,1104,4.277511961722488
4327774,4,B004CJQVP8,"Once again MGM has somewhat redeemed themselves.  After being forced with only being able to watch Revenge of the Ninja in Fullscreen, MGM has finally released it in widescreen.  This DVD also contains American Ninja and Rage of Honor.

American Ninja- Probably hands down my all-time favorite ninja movie.  Michael Dudikoff stars as an American GI who just so happens to be a ninja. He teams up with Steve James to take down an evil French arms dealer named Senior Ortega(?).  Ortega though, just happens to have a Ninja army led by the evil Black Star Ninja.  Also did I mention that Ortega also have a ninja training camp in his back yard?  This movie is a whole lot of fun.  It has cheesey dialouge, cheesey acting, tons of on-screen goofs and most importantly, tons of action.  Definatly worth checking out.

The movie itself is still 16X9 1:85 widescreen just like it has been since 2001.

Revenge of the Ninja- Another classic ninja movie.  This movie's the sequal to Enter the Ninja, which by the way have nothing to do with each other asides from Sho Kasugi appearing in all of them.  The plot centers around Sho Kasugi whose family (save for his youngest son and mother) get slaughtered by a group of Ninjas (right after the credits end no less).  Sho's American friend, Braden, encourages him to move to America and open up a doll gallery.  Turns out though, Braiden's just using the doll gallery to smuggle herion in the dolls.  After a deal with the Italian mafia falls through.  Braden don's his ninja outfit and goes around killing them off.  Sho eventually gets mixed up in the situation, which leads up to a spectacular 10 minute fight between Sho and Braden.  If you want to see the ""real"" Ninja Assassin in action, check it out.

After being stuck with an open-matte fullscreen transfer since 2003, the movie recieves a much needed upgrade to a 16X9 1:85 widescreen transfer.

Rage of the Ninja- Sho Kasugi plays a secret agent out to avenge the death of his partner by a group of drug dealers.  Really not a whole lot to say about this one, I thought it was ok at best.  The main villian himself was kind of meh to.  He didn't come across as the bad-ass Braden was in Revenge of the Ninja.  I'm betting even James Boot from Prey for Death could kick his ass.  On the plus side, there's lots of action.  Sho uses his kick ass ninja moves and unlimited supply of ninja gagets to dispose of his enemies.  I'd recommend checking this one out after you've seen the other two movies.

The transfer on this movie is questionable at best.  Originally released in Fullscreen as well, the movie recieves a 16X9 1:85 widescreen upgrade as well.  What I find questionable though is the fact there's some slight letterboxing during and after the credits while the rest of the movie fills up the Wide TV screen.  It wouldn't suprise me if MGM just used the same 2003 transfer and cropped out the top and bottom to make it look like widescreen.  If anyone's able to make a comparison, I'd love to see it.

As far as extras go, nothing has been included, no subtitles, no chapter stops, not even the Theatrical Trailers that were originally avaiable on the previous DVD's.

If you already have the prevous DVD's, I still recommend picking this up just for Revenge of the Ninja's widscreen transfer alone.

A special note to MGM:  I know you also hold the rights to Enter the Ninja, Ninja III: The Domination and Prey for Death.  Get off your asses and release those movies on DVD and Blu-ray already.",1312156800,11,3504,4.565008025682183
4327775,2,B004CJQVP8,These movies are terrible.  They might be ok to make fun of if you don't have anything else to do and if the people you have over would be amused by that.  Otherwise there's nothing good about them.,1429228800,,198,4.184210526315789

4327782,3,B004CJQVP8,"Good movies. But I had to zap two stars because it has no captions or subtitles. In this day and age? There shouldn't be anything left closed off to the deaf and hearing impaired. If it weren't for that, I'd have given it five for sure.",1411689600,,236,4.1521739130434785

Rage of Honor: Don't even watch it.  Blink and you will miss the brief appearance of ninjas.

Rage of Honor and Revenge of the Ninja both feature the awesome Sho Kusagi and there's plenty of fighting in them both. The 80's atmosphere makes them even easier to love.

American Ninja and Revenge of the Ninja in the same set what a great combination. I just wish instead of Rage of Honor being in this set maybe Enter the Ninja,Ninja III:The Domination,Pray for Death,or American Ninja 2 would have been included.

8423167,4,B004CJQVP8,"""Revenge of the Ninja"" is worth buying this triple feature even if you don't know/like the other films.  Kosugi Sho, Keith Vitalli, and Kosugi Kane play very likeable characters.  There is a lot of showcasing of individual ninja tools, probably in hopes of marketing retail items back then.
