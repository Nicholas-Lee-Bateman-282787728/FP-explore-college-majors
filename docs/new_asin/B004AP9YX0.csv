4310683,5,B004AP9YX0,I grew up in Arizona and first campaigned for Barry Goldwater during the 1958 Senate campaign.  I was 9 years old at the time.  Watching this show brought back a lot of memories and reinforced the reasons why I continue to be a Conservative to this day.  It is definitely worth watching.,1289692800,21,287,4.480769230769231
4310684,5,B004AP9YX0,This is an amazing series and Britt Hume is fantastic in this special.  Its a great illustration of the modern FREEDOM movement and the spiritual/intellectual foundation of the Party of FREEDOM.  I bought 3 copies as Christmas presents for my recovering-liberal siblings who are waking up to the intellectual/moral/spiritual depravity of liberalism!,1289692800,23,349,5.6923076923076925
4310685,5,B004AP9YX0,"An excellent documentary about the origins of the Conservative movement, warts and all.
Hosted by the dean of conservative analysts, Brit Hume, this work provides background and context to the well known figures of the movement.
Fox News has done more to break the Progressive monopoly on the media than any organization.
Can't wait for the dvd to be released.",1289433600,22,360,5.016666666666667
4310686,5,B004AP9YX0,"Saw the first part of this wonderful documentary last night on Fox News. It's a six part series and the first covered the conservative movement from the end of World War II up through the Goldwater campaign in 1964. It was like the history of my early political life and education. As a ""movement"" Conservative I have tried to explain to my, now adult children, what it was like being a political Conservative in the 1950's and 60's and now they can see it for themselves in this documentary. It covers the beginnings of National Review, Nixon and the Alger Hiss case and the ""Draft Goldwater"" movement. It tells of the influence of Ayn Rand, and the books ""Road to Serfdom"", ""Witness"", ""God and Man at Yale"" and ""Conscience of a Conservative."" There are parts of an interview with William F Buckley, a year before he died, and lots of familiar talking heads that take me back to those years. The 1960 and 1964 Republican Conventions and so much more. The narration by Brit Hume of Fox News sets just the right tone. I will definitly buy this DVD set when it is released.",1289174400,52,1071,4.525773195876289
4310687,5,B004AP9YX0,"I loved the first segment..it gives me hope that we can overcome this threat to our country- the threat of liberalism. It is a huge undertaking to try to ward socialism off- they have all the catch phrases, and they have learned to play on the emotions and vulnerability of the Cumbaya crowd- I know, my sister is one of them, and she has such good intentions but is being played like a fiddle by the socialistic agenda groups..",1289174400,23,428,4.430379746835443
4310688,5,B004AP9YX0,"I am delighted with the first segment.  I'm eager for more!  I'm buying two sets.  One to keep, one to lend out.",1289174400,23,112,4.0
4310689,5,B004AP9YX0,I learned so much I didn't know by watching the first episode that I watched it twice.  I thought I should take notes but then was hoping DVDs would be available so I could watch again & again.  Thanks Brit!!,1289088000,27,208,4.175
4310690,5,B004AP9YX0,"I just watched the first episode of this set on Fox News and it reinforces and invigorates my conservative roots.  Conservativism will end up saving our Great Country for future generations to live like we have lived under the ""Exceptional American System"" so admired by a young Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville author of Democracy in America, written in 1831.  We are at a turning point in this country and I recommend that Conservatives take the time to educate those around them, especially their children and grandchildren, about the powerful principles explained in this series.  Giants like Hayek, Buckley, Goldwater, Reagan and others are highlighted in this series, and their legacy is a proud and powerful force in present day political debates.  Thank you Fox News for this inspiration and thank you Brit Hume, an amazing journalist and in my view a truly great American.",1289088000,70,881,5.097222222222222
4310691,5,B004AP9YX0,I enjoyed the first introduction to Conservatizm by Brit Hume.  I had no idea how it started and am glad I am watching it.  It's like when the teaparty started.  I am facinated by the teaparty's ingenious approach to less Government in our Lives.  I will watch all six episodes and proably buy all six episodes to show our college kids.  Thanks Brit,1289088000,61,349,4.476190476190476
4310692,5,B004AP9YX0,"I really enjoyed this dvd package that gave an explanation to the development of modern conservatism in America.  I highly recommend all other citizens to watch this dvd series and educate themselves to not only the history of modern conservatism in America, but the significant and profound arguement for the conservative movement and their opposition to liberal/progressive/socialim/statism agenda of the political liberal left.",1300406400,,430,5.825396825396825
4310693,5,B004AP9YX0,"Brit Hume is a gentleman who presents a balanced overview of modern conservatism.  Unfortunately, conservatism should be seen as ""classical liberalism."" The term ""liberal"" was hi-jacked during the 1930s by the other side - the ""progressives.""  ""Classical liberal"" is too much of a mouthful, so, we use ""conservative"" to describe concurrence with what the Founding Fathers designed and nurtured that should meet these expectations:  place high value on representative government that safeguards liberty as its highest priority; respect private property as the foundation of individual liberty; maintain separation of the responsibility and sovereignty of State governments; keep government as small as possible, taxes as low as possible, spending as little as possible, and maintin federal debt and deficits as low as possible.  This three disc series is well worth investing the time in order to better understand and appreciate how and why the Founding Fathers understanding of human nature requires a ""conservative"" approach to governance rather than the distortion and deviations now in place from the ""progressive"" worldview.",1300060800,2,1129,5.7023809523809526
4310694,5,B004AP9YX0,"Excellent six part documentary, with historical archives I did not expect to find.  I wrote Fox asking them to be ""Fair and Balanced"" by doing the same thing for liberalism, which would be fascinating.  Stay tuned on that one.  If you are a political junkie you will like this a lot.",1299456000,,283,4.509803921568627
4310695,2,B004AP9YX0,This book is a good ilustration of how much damage Republicans have done to the USA and how the Tea Partiers are continuing the process....,1296518400,6,139,4.6
4310696,5,B004AP9YX0,This series looked excellent on TV. I ordered this at the end of November -- still have not received it.  Why is the DVD release taking so long?,1294444800,2,144,4.142857142857143
4310697,5,B004AP9YX0,"This has wonderful historic footage, a great narration, and the thrilling finish of current times! Well-told descriptions of conservative political history as it unfolded, including description by many participants in making that history. This series does not denigrate other political parties or people.  It could well be included as part of high school or college social studies or history curriculum. An excellent series that will be included in my gift-giving.",1292112000,6,464,5.628571428571429
4310698,5,B004AP9YX0,This series has blown me away! It goes into the key details of the birth and rise of conservatism without getting bogged down in the small stuff. Just as real conservatives are...simple yet powerful and correct in their beliefs and arguments. Have only seen five but my set is now on the way! Great job Brit!!,1291420800,7,309,4.535714285714286
4310699,4,B004AP9YX0,"...here's another point of view on this Series (NOT from the left, but from the right):

[Since my external link was deleted in my initial review, here's the article to which I was referring:

Faux Conservatism
By William F. Jasper
November 25, 2010
TheNewAmerican

I'm afraid you'll have to search for itself.]

(It speaks for my beliefs - which saves me writing a lot of words in this box.)

However, I HAVE seen all the episodes so far (as of this writing) and I like Brit Hume immensely. In addition, I think this Series is very well compiled, the production is high level and there are many interesting interviews, which haven't been seen in a long time. This is why I am buying this DVD Set when it is released. I just believe that people should be exposed to ALL points of view.

I also understand my review of this product will probably not receive many 'thumbs-up,' so to speak, but that's not really why I wrote this.",1291420800,12,927,4.488095238095238
4310700,5,B004AP9YX0,"I absolutely adore Brit Hume. I don't think there is anything this real journalist could do that was wrong, but even I, the original Hume Fan Girl, was blown away by this six part documentary.

If you are new to the Tea Party, if you're interested in the actual history of how American conservatism has evolved and its roots from the beginning (I mean the VERY beginning), this is your DVD series.

Fascinating footage, back to the beginning of the 20th century, of commies all over the place. The great use of modern footage from conservative powerhouses who have since died (whoever put this together is a genius!)

If you have someone whose eyes were opened by the current tenant of the White House, and who for the first time is interested in freedom, small govt, and other hallmarks of conservatism, this is the perfect Christmas gift. (If you listen closely, you'll get lots of ideas for books you SHOULD read, like Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, and Chambers' Witness.)

Probably the best done documentary of its kind. I cannot recommend this highly enough for the lifelong conservative, or the new recruits to freedom we have in the nationwide Tea Parties.",1290729600,15,1162,4.766169154228856
4310701,3,B004AP9YX0,I watched the first installment. Really eager to see more on the clever way conservatives have rallied the racist southerners. I also hope they cover Jude winiskis two SantaClause theory. Conservatisim just has soo many clever ways to get people to vote against their own best intrest. Go corporate america!,1289779200,10,307,5.16

8420637,5,B004AP9YX0,"For anyone wanting to understand the roots and development of the Conservative movement since 1950, this 6 hour DVD set is about as good as it gets. An excellent supplement and contrast to the standard US History textbook which generally presents only the mainstream version of events. Focused on conservatism's influence on the presidency, the series necessarily can give only brief sketches to many movements that played a role in this development such as the John Birch Society. Libertarianism receives one mention. Some significant factors including the fundamentalist movement (especially 1960s national radio preacher Carl McIntire and Bob Jones University), the home school movement and some luminaries such as Strom Thurmond and radio's Paul Harvey are not mentioned. The series would have to be twice as long to account for everything that majorly impacted the movement. But it is still a very well done piece worthy of the serious student.",1374624000,,949,5.333333333333333
8420638,5,B004AP9YX0,Very good as you would expect from fox the truth and only the truthallo the time from our frends at fox,1365724800,,103,3.9523809523809526
