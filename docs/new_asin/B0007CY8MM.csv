It didn't come out the way I thought it would but Kartheiser and Kirsten Dunst (Spider-man 1 and 2, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind) were cute together yet needing extreme sessions in theraputic help, I believe. James Caan (Dogville, Elf) plays Dunst's gambling father who left her when she was little. Luis Guzman (Double Whammy, Magnolia) who is fun to watch always plays Jimmy the hitman who doesnt kill on Valentines Day but ends up dying on Valentines Day, hmm. Not much here to work with only the fact that this builds up to a fueled down gun shootout at the end which was dumb and many annoying supporting cast. Dunst looks hot in that angel stripper wear. Caan later in 2003 stars in the hit tv series Las Vegas. That clever line ""what goes on in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" rings in the air in this movie but doesnt that line get boring after awhile",1109289600,2,1038,4.383419689119171
