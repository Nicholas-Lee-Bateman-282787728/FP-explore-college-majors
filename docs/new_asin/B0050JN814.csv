4514665,4,B0050JN814,"The overall quality of this (Blu-Ray) release is much better than the last live release, which completely lacked bass....
All the classic songs are here, and they are performed well. Unsurprisingly, Paul Rodgers stands out and still remains one of the best singers out there today. However, I find the overall performance strangely ""cold"" and ""removed"", with minimal audience interaction and/or band interaction. With one or two exceptions, the crowd too remains laid back and doesn't really seem to be into the whole thing....",1315267200,2,527,5.285714285714286
4514666,3,B0050JN814,"I am a big fan of Paul Rodgers and Bad Company and this DVD has much to offer.  The voice of rock & roll is still in top form and audio/visual is very good.  I enjoyed the show - but I was disappointed in the lack of musicianship instrumentally, i.e. the guitar.
  One would think that after decades of practice and refining his craft, Mick Ralphs (the original guitarist in Bad Co) would have something more to offer than just the basic chords and minimal guitar leads.  This line up at Wembley has 2 guitar players - but the 2002 concert, ""Merchants of Cool"" has only one Dave Colwell (ironically a protege of Ralphs) who plays very well and does a far better job by himself than the 2 guitarists combined at Wembley.  Merchants of Cool also has a bunch of extras, and is a much better concert.
  For the guitar fans, I also recommend the Crossroads guitar festivals 2004, 2007, and 2010 - all have 2 discs each and are packed with good music and excellent musicianship.  Ditto for Eric Clapton's Live in Hyde Park, One More Car One More Rider, Ladies & Gentlemen The Rolling Stones (Mick Taylor is hot!), John Mayall's 70th Birthday Celebration, Paul McCartney's Good Evening New York City (comes with CD & DVD), and Paul Rodgers Live In Glasgow.",1312416000,4,1249,4.515555555555555
4514667,5,B0050JN814,"I was at the concert, having arrived from Houston that morning for a week of business meetings in London.  While I had a decent seat near the front on the right side of the stage (I saw Jimmy Page backstage), the DVD has the best views of the concert.  Blu-ray compliments the views with audio and video that is comparable to being at the concert.  Lastly, unlike DVDs of their American tour the year before, the band was at their best at Wembley.  This DVD is as good as everyone is saying.",1311724800,2,491,4.304347826086956

Having 2 guitarists in the band thickens up the sound and, as always, Paul's voice is amazing.  The video and sound are excellent.  Fans of the band should pick this up.

4514704,4,B0050JN814,"BAD COMPANY-LIVE AT WEMBLY: This surprisingly solid 2010 reunion finds three quarters of the ultimate seventies supergroup pumping out many of arena rock' most enduring anthems, from the subtle (Shooting Star) to the scorching (Rock & Roll Fantasy, Movin' On). As always, Bad Company's key ingredient is hard working front man Paul Rodgers' still amazing vocal wallop (this is the same guy who belted Free's soul-powered 1970 hit All Right Now!). The meaty ninety minute setlist is heavy on expected classics like Can't Get Enough, Burnin' Sky and Run With the Pack, but also trots out forgotten chestnuts Gone, Gone, Gone, Electric Land and the playful Coasters cover Young Blood for variety's sake. Feel Like Makin' Love benefits from a tasty mandolin solo courtesy of Ex-Heart guitarist Howard Leese, while well deserved encores include Bad Company's self titled gunslinger saga and the fiery deep track Deal With the Preacher. This is the original ensemble's first trip back to their native England in three decades...suffice to say, London's prestigious Wembley Arena was treated to a heady, heartfelt homecoming that fires on all cylinders.

They did only one thing wrong on this release. They recorded it at 120,000 seat stadium. Too big, too many people, too much background. Sadly I purchased this one with another blu-ray by Foreigner. That one puts this one to shame...the difference? They recorded it in a very small hall in Memphis...not a stadium. Overall performance is a 10 but engineering and management decisions is an 8. Sorry but blu-ray and a great audio system shows all your engineering mistakes",1399334400,2,643,4.8545454545454545

His solo stuff, his Queen things, just amazing how good his vocal skills are. My only reason for not rating it a five is I saw a concert on HD net or Palladia that blows it away. After seeing that concert, all other performances just fall a little short. In this particular concert the crowd noise interfered a bit with the overall sound. I realize loud audiences can contribute to a concert, Freddy Mercury and Robbie Willians are evidence of that. But it also can distract, anywhere from a little to overwhelming the music. This is kind of in between those 2 points. If you consider their age, it is amazing that they can perform at all. For one who has been to ""return"" performances from Steppenwolf, Iron Butterfly, and others, they seem ageless (Iron Butterfly was actually booed and Steppenwolf probably deserved to be). So, expect a good, solid performance....like the holy grail I will search for the perfect one...shu",1369094400,,1030,4.696132596685083

4514844,3,B0050JN814,"The positives:  Paul Rodgers is amazing, as one expects, as one of the greatest vocalists in rock history.  Mick Ralphs, who shakes off the dust to put on a credible performance, with superb backing musicianship from Howard Leese (from girl rockers Heart), and a strong technical bass effort from Lynn Sorensen.  The song-list is extensive, with all the hits.  Addressing the dark side: the crowd: they seem to have never seen the boys in the 'glory days', which happened to be around 1975.  And, sheer *age* has stifled things quite a bit (except for Paul Rodgers, who is the ultimate showman throughout).  I love Mick Ralphs...he has never been a virtuoso, no, but his contributions to the totally unique Mott the Hoople (before Bad Co.) are legendary.  Here, he is around 62, and it is quite impressive he agreed to attempt to replicate the old show.  He seems to perk-up when Rodgers plays 'Seagull' with him on acoustic guitar (quite heartening).  Ralphs is again young on the 'tribute-to-the late Boz Burrell' called 'Gone, Gone, Gone' (Sorensen shines, as you might expect).  The finale is impressive 'Deal With the Preacher', where Mick lets it 'all hang out'.  This is worth viewing if you heard the band when they were superstars (mid-70's), and love em'.  Otherwise, you might not 'get it', like the crowd apparently didn't that night.  *Three-stars* because you can't really bring back what you were when you were a young lion, sadly for us all.  Thank you, though, Paul, you brought it all back as best you could.",1358294400,9,1526,4.841698841698841

4514847,3,B0050JN814,"I have been a Bad Company and Paul Rodgers fan since they came into prominence in the early 70s. Clearly Paul and the band still rock and have not lost their mojo even after all these decades. And they do not disappoint with their stage performance in this concert. This concert would have been an event to attend. But alas I was not that lucky.

I adore these guys and hence it pains me to have to say this... I have two gripes - (a) the VHS-standard picture quality and (b) the rapid fire camera changes.

Of the two, the latter is unforgiveable. The camera view changes are at one or two second intervals and carries on incessantly through the show, which became extremely annoying. By the second song, I was ready to switch off the player. If not for my interest in the band, I would have done so.

It was challenging to watch. You cannot even view a complete guitar solo without numerous view changes in-between. Something which will annoy any guitarist. Good bits were cut off and the viewer swung over to another views which showed nothing of consequence and so on. The editing can be best (and politely) described as 'mindless'. Pathetic really.

I have other Bad Company live concert DVDs and Blurays (Merchants of Cool & Hard Rock Live) and IMHO they are much better. At the very least, you will not get headaches watching these. I would also be inclined to say the band performances in these DVDs are tad better as well.

If you do not have any Bad Company DVDs/Blurays, then start with 'Merchants of Cool', followed by 'Hard Rock Live'. If you're a die-hard fan and have those already, and can put up with frequent changes of views, then go for it. Musically Bad Company and Paul Rodgers will satisfy.",1357516800,,1713,4.53074433656958

4514853,4,B0050JN814,"This is a very good DVD of Bad Company's April 2010 concert at London's Wembley Stadium.

Bad Company still sounds great. Paul Rodgers' voice has held up really well and the band members are very tight in concert.

The band is now comprised of three original members: Paul Rodgers, vocals, Mick Ralphs, guitar and Simon Kirke, drums. There are two additional players: Howard Leese, formerly of Heart, on guitar and Lynn Sorensen on bass, replacing the late Boz Burrell, who died in 2006.

The sound production on the DVD is very good; the video quality is also very good, although the editing frequently resorts to a series of very fast cuts, which I find a bit disconcerting.

One criticism I have of the production is that there were apparently two encore songs which aren't included on the DVD. During the band interviews included as extra features, Paul Rodgers specifically refers to the encores, so one wonders why they weren't included on the DVD. If those encores had been included, I would've given this DVD 5 stars rather than 4.

Apart from that, this is a very good DVD. It's a worthwhile purchase for any Bad Company fans from the 1970s and/or anyone who has discovered Bad Company since the band first broke up more than 30 years ago.",1350259200,,1248,4.706422018348624

4514855,4,B0050JN814,"I have some really excellent concert Blu-Rays and DVD's. I am trying not to make a judgement based on them and let it color my opinion of this Blu-ray. Bottom line for me is sound! I am going to give this 4 stars...I wish i could give it 5...but I just can't. The rhythm and lead guitars just aren't right IMO. Paul Rodgers is 100% on the money! And I don't really get it, Mick Ralfs and Simon Kirk are also original members and some of the iconic songs that we know Bad Company for just lose their uniqueness because the music isn't played right.

Still it is an excellent Blu-ray. The sound is recorded excellent and still brings back awesome memories. Just not  what I get when I listen to the original recordings. What a shame though...one of my favorite 70's bands. Still a 4 star...so don't let my disappointment stop you from buying it.",1344816000,,843,4.397435897435898

4514860,3,B0050JN814,"Pardon me while I get some aspirin. My head is spinning.

First. Bad Company is fine and in good form. But the endless quick cuts to new camera angles spoiled an otherwise fine concert. It's dizzying. I don't think there was a single moment of camera time that lasted more than one second.

Let's see the complete solos for example without darting away. I do have an attention span that lasts longer than 400 milliseconds so I don't need this. Do film editors think that quick cuts add excitement to a film?

Another reviewer detailed his dissatisfaction with this and I'm in full agreement. I think that Bad Company must share the blame. Is this how they want to represent  themselves to their fans? Other concert films do it right, why can't they?",1333324800,15,749,4.609022556390977

But despite all this they have not lost their musical capabilities and still play good solid rock 'n roll. In fact as they admit, they probably sound more polished and professional now than what they did then. With the two American add-ins the group of five blend together magnificently and put on a fantastic concert.

I've been a Bad Company fan for almost 40 years, own all their CDs, and have seen them many times in concert through the years.  The audio on this DVD is incredible; the band sounds amazing!  But within the first thirty seconds of the opening song (Can't Get Enough), I knew that I was not going to enjoy viewing this show.  Multi-camera views are fantastic, but when they are changing every 1-2 seconds, it's hard to process what I'm looking at and, as a result, I get pissed!
