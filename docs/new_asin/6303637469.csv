690736,5,6303637469,"Superior sequel to ""Curse of Frankenstein"" delivers in this Hammer Technicolor gem. This one is a bonafide sequel as it picks up right where ""Curse"" left off. Story involves brain transplants(which  became a staple plot ingredient in other Hammer Frank films to follow-also  check out Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed!)This is a beautifully produced  film with great sets, music, and wonderful 19th century atmoshpere.  Handsome Hammer production that deserves a high rating in this Hammer  genre. Interesting ending as well.",962064000,,523,5.569620253164557
690737,5,6303637469,"The second of hammer's frankenstein films picks up directly after the first with Victor Frankenstein being led to the guillotine, but he escapes with the help of a man named Karl. The good doctor then flees to another  town and sets up medical practice as Dr. Stein. Here he is popular because  he will give help to the poor, but he's colllecting any parts he amputates.  He has also agreed to take Karl's brain from his twisted body and place it  into a new body made from collected parts.  In the new body, Karl flees and  the other local doctors are beginning to wonder about Dr. Stein's real  identity.  This is a tight, excellant film from beginning to end. The  story deals more with human emotions than the first did, we have more of a  creation than a creature in this film. The acting is first rate, Peter  Cushing is as cold as ice and very sharp in an exceptionally strong  performance. The sets, costumes and visuals are of the usual fine Hammer  quality. This film is just slightly better than the first, and I think it  is due to the acting and the way it just flows along.",952992000,7,1087,4.396984924623116
690738,5,6303637469,"This is a wonderful film, and Cushing is brilliant as always. I think it's actually the best of Hammer's tales about Frankenstein.

690939,5,6303637469,"You can't keep a good doctor down I suppose. Continuing from the ""Curse,"" we see the Baron about to be sentenced to the gallows, but an able assist from his dwarf henchman saves him. Leaving the Baron to relocate and pick up his work in a new town. Now--after 3 years in practice--the Baron's new identity is discovered by another young doctor, seeking the great man's knowledge & once again, the Baron seeks to create life.

This time, the Baron seeks to transplant the brain of the dwarf into a new, slightly scarred, but still better body. But--as with the last film--that brain gets damaged too, and the new body becomes deformed again. After the Baron is found out, he gets beaten to death and more surgery leads to the doctor himself resuming life in a new body and relocating to London.

A very solid sequel to ""Curse of Frankenstein""--not quite as good as the original, but great entertainment nonetheless, especially when the Baron confronts Karl near the end of the movie. These Hammer films have not disappointed so far--makes me wish I had started watching them sooner...",1499472000,,1083,4.75531914893617

690942,5,6303637469,"It seems like a rarity to get a 100% clear and true sequel to a horror movie of this era, but the Revenge of Frankenstein is just that. The first movie is heavily referenced and has a major presence on this film.

This movie is a character study of Frankenstein and takes into account all that happened to him in the Curse of Frankenstein. Taking this into context, his decisions in this film seem logical and you start to want him succeed. He gets closer and closer to realizing his scientific advancement and proving to everyone it is in fact possible. This is what I love about these first two Hammer Frankensteins - Frankenstein is doing what he is doing ultimately to push the field of medicine forward (despite how twisted he would become). This gives the film more of a shade of gray than good vs evil. Frankenstein does do good and help some people as a Doctor. He also does some of them bad. Its really interesting.

New additions to the cast are welcome in the form of Hans, who forms a believable and likable relationship with the Doctor and I was really disappointed he was not in any of the other films of the series.

There are not really any ""monsters"" per se in this film, so be aware if that is what you like about these movies.

I am truly saddened by Hammer's decision to essentially reboot the series after this movie, turning it more into an anthology series with loosely (perhaps not at all) connected stories all featuring Frankenstein. By the end of this movie you are left wondering what could happen next - unfortunately, we will never know.

691137,4,6303637469,"The 4 stars would be 5 stars for ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"", but there is a big problem !

""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" is a 1958 direct
(and, many think, superior)
sequel to the landmark 1957 release ""The Curse of Frankenstein""
(the film that jump-started Hammer Films of England to great success that continued until the early 1970s).

Unfortunately, this Blu-ray contains a mediocre (and that is being polite) HD transfer
that was made over 15 years ago
(for ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"")

(""The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"" looks passable, but it is a rather so-so movie, and nothing really happens until the final 20 minutes).

Sony should not have allowed such an excellent, well-made, Classic Hammer film as  ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" to be released this way.

A real shame.

To add insult to injury, this Mill Creek Blu-ray has a very low data rate (aka, bit rate), which only makes the image even less robust.

(Strange, as the 2 recent Double-Movie William Castle Blu-ray movie sets released by Mill Creek have a very decent bit rate --
 What happened here?
 Did Mill Creek think the visual quality of the Hammer Frankenstein transfer was so bad that there was no reason for a higher bit rate?)

Bottom line, ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" is top tier Hammer Horror,
and
Sony (who owns the USA rights) should go back to the best elements available
and
give the world a proper HD (even 4K) restoration of this excellent motion picture.",1476662400,10,1450,4.783132530120482

691143,5,6303637469,"Excellent Hammer horror classic from 1958 and the sequel to '57's the Curse of Frankenstein. Director Terrence Fisher and Peter Cushing were a winning combination. I liked the smooth transition from the guillotine scene in Curse to that scene in Revenge where things didn't quite go as expected, and the Baron lived on. The story is quite good and acting first rate for this type of movie. Cushing has that unique goulish look to go with his superior acting talent and has made these Hammer productions quite entertaining and successful. The DVD  has a very good widescreen anamorphic picture and fills my 50 inch display. The DVD was first released in 2002 by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment.",1475539200,,697,4.957264957264957

691145,4,6303637469,"Two of the best sequel--or more properly called follow-up films in Hammer's impressive Horror library.  Many consider Revenge of Frankenstein to be the best of the Frankenstein films they did--I don't personally, but that series of films directed by Terence Fisher is for my money the best series of horror films every made and among the most influencial.  As to the Mummy sequel it may actually be the only good follow up mummy film-the one weakness being the mummy suit which is not as scary or as convincing as in the first film.  But mostly what I should talk about for people who know all of the above already is the quality of transfers and sound of this blu ray.  The Mummy film looks fantastic and sounds so too.  Sadly Revenge of Frankenstein looks like an upres from standard definition.  It may not be one I just say that to give you an idea of what I say.

691269,3,6303637469,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this Mill Creek double-feature release is very bare bones. It's okay, but really should have been much better.

* Low quality bluray. Both films are compressed onto a single-layer bluray totalling 20Gb. You'll notice compression artefacts if you get close
* Films are unrestored. That means lots of white flecks and scratches. Lots of grain especially in the opening titles to Revenge of Frankenstein
* No subtitles or special features
* Soft image - probably no better than DVD. I'm curious to see how well the HD versions of both films on iTunes compares.
* Region locked to region A (North America) so you'll need a multi-region player if ordering from Europe (or in Australia like me).

I'm happy with the films themselves. Revenge of Frankenstein is one of Hammer's best in that series, with a typically great performance by Peter Cushing. The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb is the weaker of the two, but still entertaining especially if you're a Hammer fan. By contrast I'm disappointed that the bluray quality is as poor as it is. Surely a dual-layer disk allowing larger files with less compression wouldn't have added so much to the price.",1473724800,,1180,4.865671641791045
691270,1,6303637469,"REVENGE OF FRANKENSTIEN & THE CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB
First time ever blu-ray release of both classic Hammer films by Mill creek ent'
i already own the old Sony pictures dvd of Revenge of Frankenstien which is a very Good Digital remaster transfer i think
so i compared my dvd version to this new blu-ray reissue
well Mill creek's HD transfer of both films is terrible picture quality looks more like a crap DVD transfer
and the sound quality has not been boosted up at all it's the same 2.0 Dolby mono sound as the old dvd
the Curse of the Mummy's tomb HD transfer is no different
Honestly i think my old dvd version of Revenge of Frankenstein is much better transfer than Mill creek's so called HD transfer
and guess what no extras not even the original Theatrical trailer has been carried over
pretty tragic, no respect has been given by Mill creek that's for sure
it makes you think why Mill creek even bothered to get the right's to both Hammer films to reissue on blu-ray
when they can't be bothered making the effort to make the HD transfer look like 1080p quality & boost the sound quality
makes absolute no sense, amazon are selling this for $15, incredible ripoff waste of money
in my opinion Mill creek should go out of business if they keep producing crap blu-ray reissues
these 2 classic Hammer films deserve much better respect than the crap that Mill creek have given the films
4 stars for each Hammer film, 1 star for this new blu-ray it's Bulls*** blu-ray reissue waste of money",1473465600,4,1497,4.507352941176471
691271,4,6303637469,"Having owned both of these films on DVD from Columbia Pictures for many years, and being a fan of almost all the Hammer horror series, I was quite excited to learn that these films were getting the Blu-ray treatment. I confess, my excitement waned a bit when I learned this double feature was being put out my bargain outfit Millcreek Entertainment. While it's true their products sell for about a third of what the major studio-produced discs do, their quality is sometimes marginal.

Happily, the company appears to have used the Columbia masters here, and the results are mostly very good. I've just done a back-to-back comparison of the first 10 minutes of both films (both the Blu and DVD, played on the same equipment), and there is some improvement in clarity. Some improvement, not a HUGE difference. For example, the ""fine print"" on the Mummy picture's opening credits (Fine print? Oh you know, ""The characters and events portrayed in this film are fictional,"" etc.). Curse itself, though decidedly one of Hammer's lesser offerings, benefits from some great use of color, and the HD format makes the film look more expensive than it probably was. The colors are also a bit more pronounced in Frankenstein, as compared to the DVD.

The films themselves: Revenge of Frankenstein holds up very well, and ranks right beside its predecessor (Curse of Frankenstein) as one of the studio's finest horror films. Peter Cushing would play the role 4 more times, but was never better than he is here. There's also some shocking gore that still manages to turn the stomach if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. Curse of the Mummy's Tomb, unlike the studio's Frankenstein and Dracula pictures, is not connected to Hammer's 3 other Mummy movies. It's a pretty dull affair, occasionally enlivened by some impressive set designs and a handful of atmospheric scares. It is substantially better than its follow-up, the plodding Mummy's Shroud (the series would ultimately go out on a high note with Blood From the Mummy's Tomb).

If you happen to have these films on DVD already, I would still recommend an upgrade. . .especially at the very-reasonable current price. Be advised though that these are ""bare bones"" releases, with just the movie and no additional features. There aren't even chapter stops, just the option to choose which film you want to view, and then it starts playing. This release pairs nicely with Millcreek's other double feature, The Gorgon and the underrated Two Faces of Dr. Jeckyll.",1473120000,12,2504,4.957142857142857

691275,5,6303637469,"A must pleasant surprise, ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" is surely one of Terence Fisher's best films. It is not as well known as ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" and the other films of Hammer-Fisher series based on Mary Shelley's characters, possibly because it lacks a ""monster"", and it hardly fits in the ghastly ""horror movie"" category, in spite of the promotional ads that show a green creature. Of course there is a creature made by Dr. Victor Frankenstein from several human body parts, but it is more sad and pitiful than green or hideous. This time there is an evident medical progress in Dr. Frankenstein's experiments, and by the end of the film they have been (apparently) completely successful. Hammer production values are high as usual, and the work of the customary technical and artistic personnel of the company is remarkable, in particular Jimmy Sangster's tight screenplay, Jack Asher's dark cinematography, and Bernard Robinson's inspired art direction, creating a rich textured drama with very little. Excellent Peter Cushing is as usual a very ruthless Dr. Frankenstein, and Francis Matthews, Michael Gwynn, Eunice Gayson (originally cast as ""Miss Moneypenny"" in the Bond film series), Richard Wordsworth and Oscar Quitak give effective support as the key characters that propel the drama. Highly recommended.",1448496000,2,1326,5.319047619047619
691416,4,6303637469,"This is the sequel to Hammer Films' first ""Frankenstein"" film, centering on the adventures of the creator rather than the created.

Escaping execution, the Baron turns up three years later under an assumed name, practicing medicine but running afoul of the local doctors' council because he snubs them. He is still experimenting, planning to help his semi-paralyzed assistant into a normal life by transferring his brain into an able body. Things go awry, of course...

This is a fast-moving film making it seem much shorter than it actually is. Sometimes things happen a bit too fast, such as when the Baron is confronted by a doctor guessing his secret and he immediately decides to make him a colleague in his experiments. No test questions, no, ""Why should I trust you?"" Just stick out a hand and shake on it and the deal's done. Mutual trust all around. There's no love interest in this story and the insertion of the minister's daughter as some kind of vague ""Helper"" seems merely a plot ploy to set the monster free. After all, someone has to do it.

The color is lavish and the costumes authentic. I found myself fascinated by the men's ties or cravats or ascots or whatever their neckpieces were called.

Peter Cushing is good as usual and there's a talented supporting cast, most of them from the Hammer ""repertory company""... Richard Wordsworth, Lionel Jeffries, Michael Ripper...faces seen again and again in these films.

Fortunately, as luck or design would have it, the bad doctor went his merry way, setting up shop in another town.  Unfortunately, that town had a stringent medical council that demanded he join their ranks or else.  He ungraciously declines and gains a blackmailing stooge for an assistant (Francis Matthews as Dr. Hans Kleve).  It doesn't pay to be famous and familiar.  Soon they're plotting to do another brain transplant, shoving the brain of faithful sidekick Karl into a better body by Baron.  Naturally, there are complications.  This is what comes of not following doctor's orders.

691524,5,6303637469,"This movie is a pretty good Frankenstein movie as it had a few of good supporting characters and performances from Francis Matthews and Michael Gwynn. I didn't like Matthews character of the a young man who blackmails Frankenstein into mentoring him. He was meant to be not likable and Matthews does a good job making us not like him. Gwynn did a good job as a gentle monster I liked him but his character could have played a bigger part in the story. Eunice Gayson did a good job but she wasn't really important in the story. This is clearly Peter Cushing's show and that is a good thing. Cushing delivers as always a great performance as Frankenstein. He escapes the guillotine to start a new life with a new identity as Dr. Stein. It was clever to just drop the Franken and go with Stein for short. This was the follow up to The Curse of Frankenstein. I thought it was a good movie and featured a surprise ending that was cool. I recommend this movie to horror movie fans and those interested in watching some of the older horror movies. You can never go wrong with a Peter Cushing horror film. I personally like some of the other Frankenstein Hammer films better like Frankenstein must be Destroyed, The Evil of Frankenstein and Frankenstein Created Woman. But this one was good too.

Sangster manages to create a whole new story line and world for the Frankenstein story.  Peter Cushing gives a brilliant and multi-dimensional performance as the resourceful Dr. Stein (aka Frankenstein). Francis Mathews also gives a sharp and subdued performance as Dr. Hans Kleve, the baron's new pupil.  The tragic lab assistant, Karl Immelmann (who saved the baron from his death sentence at the end of the first film and the  beginning of this movie) is played with emotion by Oscar Quitak and then Michael Gwynn.

By volunteering his time to the poor during the day, he is able to continue his seedy experiments by night, using bits and pieces of his other patients to give his invalid assistant a new body! Peter Cushing returns in THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Terence Fisher's worthy follow-up to the electrifying CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Frankenstein casts off the diabolical persona found throughout the series, and takes on a rather noble and selfless role here... Or so it would seem... His newest experiment appears to be a complete success, until Karl's body begins rejecting its new components as his brain slips into a primitive state, making him unfit for Frankenstein to put on display. Michael Gwynn is fantastic as Frankenstein's pitiful experiment, having to play both the amiable victim of the evil plot, and a crazed monster. Cushing is far more reserved than before, but takes every opportunity to excel, especially when confronted by the medical counsel and his misguided patients in the end. A top-rate sequel, to be sure!

Everybody here said that this was a great classic film and with Cushing in his prime, how could it not be?  Well, it didn't work for me.  I think my problem with it is simple.  Nothing really happens.  When Cushing is not on screen, the movie loses so much of its drive and the side characters aren't all that compelling to me as they feel like the most generic of all Hammer extras.  On top of that, you can feel the lack of a budget as it feels like most of the movie takes place in the same three or four rooms and nowhere else and the monster makeup looks bad.

The only reason I didn't give this one star is because Cushing is great, especially with his subtle reaction to the entrance of the monster during the recital.  He's always in control but he allows himself the briefest moment of panic.  Also, the ending is crazy and Cushing is game for that, the final scene being one of the best in the series.",1288396800,9,1051,4.267676767676767

691949,5,6303637469,"I'm reworking my way through the Frankenstein movies,beginning with 1957's ""The Curse of Frankenstein"". This 1958 sequel (running time approx 89 minutes) takes off directly from its predecessor, where Frankenstein (the great Peter Cushing) has been sentenced to death by guillotine, but manages to escape with the help of the crippled Karl (Oscar Quitak). Three years later, Frankenstein has assumed a new identity, that of Dr. Stein, a benign and philanthropic doctor who tends to the needs of the wealthy by day and ministers to the poor by night. But of course, our dear baron has not forgotten his old experiments or desire to play God, taking the various amputated body parts for his own infernal experiments. This time, he has an able and willing helper/conspirator, Dr. Hans Kleve (Francis Matthews, from Dracula: Prince of Darkness) whom Stein grooms and takes under his wing. Before long, the crippled Karl finds a new 'lease of life' in a nicer looking body, but his mind unfortunately is not all that wholesome, and the cycle of violence continues. Karl finds a benefactress in an attractive and wealthy young lady (Eunice Gayson) who actually shines in her small role. With violence unleashed in the town, the medical council whose members are already jealous of Stein's success start digging into Stein's past and make a startling discovery which may cause our 'good' doctor to be on the run again.

Peter Cushing is simply amazing as Baron Frankenstein aka Dr. Stein. He portrays a 'softer' side to Stein in this movie compared to Curse as in Curse he was all evil, there really was no redemptive feature to him in his pursuit of 'manufacturing' life and playing God. In Revenge, Cushing still manages to credibly portray the determination and ambition that is Frankenstein's pervasive characteristic, but he also manages to imbue the character with a semblance of sensitivity as when he acts as Hans' mentor and also in caring for the poor. There is a bit more depth to Frankenstein's character here than in the earlier movie.

This DVD release has the movie in the Eastman color version and not the Technicolor version which results in a rather muted tone, not altogether pleasing but acceptable. I found the audio quality (2.0 mono) to be excellent. Not much in the way of extras, just a picture gallery and trailers of ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"", ""Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers', and ""The Bride"" . Final verdict - an excellent sequel to Curse of Frankenstein and with Peter Cushing in the lead, one can hardly go wrong.

And if the villagers don't like it, Dr. Frankenstein simply moves on and starts anew.  In this movie which takes up where ""Curse of Frankenstain"" leaves off, we find Dr. Victor surviving his ""hanging"" at the gallows and begins again as Dr. Stein in a new city.  Here, he becomes a highly popular physician who is not well regarded by the city's medical board.  By day, he runs his clinic and helps the less fortunate at the charity hospital; and by night, he continues those crazy experiments, hoping to give his badly disfigured servant,Karl, a new body.  Taking on an assistant, the doc performs the surgery.  Karl seems to be doing nicely until he finds his emotional health beginning to deteriorate and begins to run amok, killing a village girl.  When everyone in town finds out who Victor Stein really is, the patients at the hospital beat up the doc.

Through blackmail opposed on him, Frankenstein also has the aid of a young doctor(Francis Matthews) in creating a body for the unfortunate Jailor, Karl. The experiment is a success and Kral has a new body in the form of Michael Gywnn, but there are defects that become apparent....

Macabre sequel to the original features a slightly more human, but no less determined, Cushing as Frankenstein who gives one of his best performances. Michael Gwynn arises much sympathy as Karl and his transformation as the film progresses is very tragic.

The film is laced with some wonderful Gothic humor, including Michael Ripper as a graverobber and the ""patients"" of Cushing's Frankenstein, whom the Baron obtains his ""spare parts"" add a suitably dark touch.
Expertly directed by Terence Fisher and as fast paced as his masterpiece,""Horror of Dracula""(1958), this is one of the genre's essential films.

692067,4,6303637469,"As someone who grew up with, and is overly fond of, the classic Universal Frankenstein movies starring Boris Karloff (usually) and directed by James Whale (the best ones) I've avoided the Hammer Studio's monster movies like the plague.  I didn't want to soil my pleasant memories of the noble Creature with what, if the trailers were true to the films, looked like cheap, tawdry and exploitative rip-offs of the real thing. Well, THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN is obviously built on a budget, but it's a smart and entertaining little movie, bolstered considerably by the presence of Peter Cushing as the good - er, bad - Baron von Frankenstein.

 I've apparently stumbled upon part two, because the first scene in the film show the Baron being led up the scaffolds before spending the better chunk of act one showing us how he wasn't really knocked off in the first movie (the internet, by the way, confirms this suspicion.)  Capped out like Count Dracula and relocated to a different small Bavarian burg, Frankenstein has changed his name to Dr. Stein and splits his time between a profitable private practice, consisting mainly of silly wealthy women and their marriage-age nieces and daughters, and his work at the charitable hospital.  Fortunately for all concerned, Dr Stein has a lame and crippled assistant, and the wards are filled with all these juicy body parts....

 I wasn't sure I'd like THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN - it was recommended to me - but I found it solidly entertaining.  Cushing's Doctor F is more sinister than Colin Clive's, or even Basil Rathbone's.  Like Rathbone Cushing played Sherlock Holmes, and there's a lot of Holmes' condescension and overbearing arrogance displayed here - a good thing.  REVENGE isn't nearly as richly textured as the Whale/Karloff movies, but it's good enough.  Solid entertainment.",1146960000,,1835,5.043046357615894

The original sequel to ""Curse of Frankenstein"" is a beautifully mounted, directed and acted minor masterpiece of the horror film. Jimmy Sangster's thoughtful and restrained screenplay illustrates the reason why he was Hammer's best screenwriter, rivalled only by Terence Fisher's masterful direction. Good old Peter Cushing is back, as a slightly more mellow, humane Baron Frankenstein. Cushing is a joy to watch and listen to as he smoothly maneuvers his way through and insinuates himself into the politics and society of an elegant Swiss burg in the 1860's. The only thing missing is a James Bernard score!

692069,3,6303637469,"There is a school of thought that the best form of revenge is success.  In this case, the Revenge of Frankenstein is accurately titled, as the character is not interested in any of the more standard forms of vengeance.  Instead, Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) has moved on from his life of murder and monster-creating to a gentler life of tending to the ill under the name Stein.

Even though Frankenstein is far more benevolent (and outside of a murder at the beginning of the story, he commits less real evils), he is still Frankenstein, and that means he has to tamper with life and death.  Once again, he intends to create a man from the parts of others.  This creature is more well-put together than the Christopher Lee creature in the first movie in the series (Curse of Frankenstein) and a willing candidate for the brain:  Frankenstein's loyal but disfigured servant, Karl.

And since this is a Frankenstein movie, things will go wrong, although this time a lot of it is not Frankenstein's fault.  The man becomes a monster with the usual amount of murderous havoc.  This, in turn, threatens Frankenstein's hidden identity.

This is decent, standard Hammer Films fare:  there are nice sets, limited special effects, okay writing and competent (but stiff) acting.  Tame by today's standards, this film does still have its moments and will please many fans of more ""classic"" horror.  It rates a high three stars; it is not the best introduction to Hammer horror, but it is a slightly above average effort.",1137715200,4,1509,4.84765625

I feel this could have been rather easily remedied without distorting the script so I detract one star.  However, the story is so clever (the salient points were ripped off by, among others, NBC 15 years later in their made-for-TV ""Frankenstein: the True Story"" starring David McCallum and Michael Sarrazin) and Cushing's portrayal of the good doctor so absolutely perfect that it is worth watching over and over again primarily to see Dr. Frankenstein in his penultimate glory.  This would be great remade with much more monster action and gore if it weren't for the fact that Mr. Cushing is no longer with us and, equally sad, Hollywood would probably find some cheap-visioned director to expensively butcher it.

692225,4,6303637469,"Halloween is a good time to dip into the classic horror library, and there are few classics better than the Hammer horror films.  Revenge of Frankenstein is the sequel to Hammer's successful Curse of Frankenstein.  Peter Cushing returns as the good doctor.  Having escaped the gallows 3 years prior, Dr. Frankenstein is living and practicing medicine in Germany under the name Dr. Stein.  He splits his time between a successful practice and treating the poor.  Of course he has not abandoned his research in creating life.  His work with the poor serves as a good source of ""materials"".  In this film he transports the brain of a disfigured assistant into a new body.  Unfortunately, all does not go smoothly and Dr. Frankenstein once again becomes a wanted man.
I like the course Hammer took with the Frankenstein films.  They focused on the ""real monster"" instead of resurrecting the same creature over and over.  Cushing is always a pleasure to watch and he plays the role perfectly.  The picture quality on the DVD is very good and is presented in widescreen format.  There are some very minor scratches, etc. visible here and there, but they are minor and I doubt the film has ever looked this good.  Colors are fairly sharp and clear, though not quite as good as the Warner release of ""Curse"". The sound is crisp and audible with virtually no hissing.  There are virtually no extras on the disc save for a couple of stills and a trailer.
If you are looking to start a Hammer library, this disc should be high on your list just behind the aforementioned ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""Horror of Dracula"".",1066348800,24,1608,4.737410071942446
692226,3,6303637469,"In this addition to the series Dr. Victor Fankenstein (Peter Cushing) escapes hanging and is soon back to his old tricks. While walking through a graveyard the supposedly deceased Frankenstein comes across a grave robber and greets him ""Good evening, I am Frankenstein"" resulting in the robber having a heart attack and falling into the open grave!
Frankenstein soon gets back to practising medicine under the alias Dr. Stein; but a medical student soon discovers his true identity and threatens to expose Frankenstein unless he takes him on as his protege. Frankenstein reluctantly agrees and the pair soon embark on their first experiment- transplanting the brain of a partially paralysed man into a healthy new corpse (that doesn't sound right). Peter Cushing is good, the production atmospheric and the script above average. Not a classic, but recommended to horror fans nevertheless.",1045180800,2,888,5.304964539007092
692227,5,6303637469,"We pick up at the end of The Curse of Frankenstein where Dr. Frankenstein had been sentenced to death and is being led to the guillotine. He escapes with the aid of a cripple, Carl, which he has promise a new body for helping him escape. Later a Dr. Stein has opened a clinic where he treats the poor. He continues his experiments in a secret lab where he has assembled a body for Carl.
As Dr. Stein practice flourishes, the local medical council is offended that he will not join their ""group."" The council visits Dr. Stein and tries to persuade him to join but he refuses. One of the council members Hans recognizes him at Dr. Frankenstein and decides to assist him. Dr. Stein and Hans give Carl a new body but when his brain becomes damage in a brawl, he turns into a cannibalistic monster.
We have another wonderful performance by Peter Cushing as Dr. Frankenstein/Stein.
The transfer to DVD is excellent.",1038355200,2,909,4.515151515151516
692228,2,6303637469,"Definitely not one of Hammer's better films. They just didn't know how to make a Frankenstein film. Cushing is back but the horror isn't. Again, acting and production values are fine---they just forgot to add the horror this time. Instead we have a dull movie that leaves you wondering what audience did they intend this for...you got a laboratory, a hospital, an assistant and a pretty girl but where's the monster? Just a fairly regular looking joe with stiches here and there. And he's literate! And he has a conscience. From a transplanted brain?  I passed on this one and can't recommend it.

Few sequels live up to the expectations of the original. By taking a completely different approach (dropping the monster in favor of following the much more interesting Dr) than the Universal series of films, Hammer actually kept the series from becoming routine... What matters most performances and intelligent direction.

""Revenge"" finds ""Dr. Stein"" (Peter Cushing) but, really, Dr. Frankenstein continuing his experiments after being spared the guillotine, uses a public health clinic as a front to continue his work of creating life from the dead. He's learned from his mistakes and this time has both the perfect body and the perfect brain to achieve his goal this time with assistance from a new doctor (Francis Mathews).

Needless to say, things go horribly wrong but Michael Gwynn's  (who gave another terrific performance in ""Quatermass and The Pitt"") performance as the creature is among the most sympathetic almost overshadowing Cushing's steely doctor.

Jimmy Sangster's script abandons all the history attached to the previous Universal horror films  and focuses on many of the issues that drove Mary Shelly's classic novel. He also focuses on the driven, obsessed Baron Frankenstein. Clearly this script (or film) had an impact on Christopher Isherwood's ""Frankenstein: The True Story"" filmed two decades later. Peter Cushing gives a skilled, sharp performance and, as usual, he is the film's secret weapon. He could  play the phone book and make it interesting. This is one of his best performances in a genre film.

 Francis Mathews also gives a sharp performance as a doctor that becomes Dr. Stein's pupil.

Update for Blu-ray: The Blu-ray is clearly pulled from an older master. There's been little effort to clean up the flaws (I'm not sure if a print was used or an interpositive).. Colors are dull and washed out. This could be due to the lower bit rate (more on that later).  Detail is fairly weak as well. Colors aren't as robust as the DVD from 2004. This almost looks like an upscaled DVD (although I doubt it is) as the image is fairly soft. It's a pity that one of Hammer's best sequels is presented in such a poor fashion. Sony needs to rescan the film and do some restoration. It might be better to wait for a restoration and release from overseas. This isn't a surprise given that Mill Creek is a budget bottom of the barrel label but Sony OWNS the rights to this and could easily have done some work as they could sell this to one of the streaming channels.

The bit rate is also very low as both features are jammed on a single layer Blu-ray disc. The lower bit rate along with a poor encoding job could account for the weak colors and poor detail but there has to have been some fading of the original colors as well. A better bit rate would have boosted both and the fact that Mill Creek didn't opt for this is disappointing given that this will likely be the only BD release in the United States.

Audio is quite good  (although for those keeping track it isn't lossless) with dialog clear and the original mono soundtrack presented without any distortion. There are no subtitles which is a curious choice given that the audience for vintage Hammer films are more likely boomers who could benefit from having these.

Unlike the DVD which had both a trailer and production stills as extras, this has nothing.

""Curse of The Mummy's Tomb"" is an altogether different matter. Although it isn't quite as good as a film, it moves quickly, has bolder, stronger colors although detail is, once again, relatively weak. There's also an issue with macroblocking which is distracting (this is due to a poor encode for the Blu-ray done by Mill Creek during the authoring stage). The film has never looked particularly outstanding either in cinemas or home video but receives a slightly improved transfer here (or at least more sympathetic than ""Revenge"").

For the price is this worth it? I guess so just adjust your expectations. This won't look as great as the Hammer films released on Blu-ray overseas and it truly is a pity that ""Revenge"" (one of the stellar productions of Hammer and a great sequel) hasn't gotten the love that it truly deserves in terms of a restoration but, like a lot of vintage films, Sony doesn't feel there is enough of an audience to warrant it otherwise they wouldn't have allowed Mill Creek to release it particularly in its current condition.

Recommended but adjust your expectatons accordingly.",1032652800,35,4569,4.835897435897436
692230,5,6303637469,This movie along with the Curse of Frankenstein are the two the propelled Peter Cushing to the top of the genre.

692231,4,6303637469,"After filming was finished on ""The Horror of Dracula(1958)"", Terence Fisher moved on wasting no time and started shooting a sequel to his ""Curse of Frankenstein(1957)"". Though while it would continue the story where ""Curse"" left off, Fisher deliberlty strayed far away as possible from the formula of his orginal, and dwelled more on a more personal take on the subject, a  much more character-driven film, a little more Fisherian so to speak. And what unfolds is Fisher's wonderful view of the social hypocrisy of vitorian society, and it's many social orders, with at the same time explores the weak-minded simplitian's struggle in a society that lies and back-stabbs one another, a society in which an outcast of tragic cercimstances must find refuge from the people who denouce it and call it ""Freak"", one who feels that if he's like the common man, he won't be labeled uncommon. And to acomplish such as task, would have to call upon the ""meaningful but misguided benifactor"", who would be in this case,""The Baron"". Fisher ingeniously removes the Baron Frankenstein from the usual hocus-pocus mad scientist formula, and injects him right into the very thing that the Baron despises the most, ""Society"". With it's everlasting forcing of hypocrtical views, that one can not help but side with the Baron. When it almost looks as though it's definate that the Baron finally gives the tortured soul a new body which would finnaly lift that curse , and at the same time shrine the Baron amoung the immortals of science, fullfilling both mens desires, society flushes it down the toilet by calling upon ""ignorance"". In this case ignorance is shaped in the form of a bumbling drunken janitor, who ruthlessly beats the Baron's experimental volunteer, resluting it back into it's democially depressed form, gaining canibal-like tendices, going on a killing excursion. This all gains the intrests of Carlsbruck's hypocrtical medical board, which gives them the chance to flush out that threat,that very thing they call evil.....or in other words their competion in the medical business..The Baron himself.  Near the end in a stunning scene, executed with exellence by Fisher, the Depressed manic, justably name Karl, erupts distrubing a social event by clashing through some french windows , here the creature finds himself back in the begoded old world, in which he was transported from, to find himself back and defeated into that very world that denounced him, at the same time anouncing the Baron's down-fall. In the end, it seems that soceity's ignorance has one the battle, but it's the Baron who made a fool of society and whipped the floor with them, as he sets up another practice to continue his battle, and claim victory over his scientific desires. Fisher would tend to go more personal with the Frankenstein subject as he ventured on, starting with his Masterful ""Frankenstein Created Woman(1967)."" Which would push the whole Frankenstein-mirror image to it's fullest and finnaly to it's max with his masterpiece ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed(1969)""

692232,5,6303637469,"The second film in Hammer's Frankenstein series, ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" is much superior to the initial film, ""The Curse of Frankenstein.""  The film picks up right where the last one left off, with Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) escaping execution by sending the priest who was hearing his confession as his substitute for the guillotine.  A few years later the mad doctor is working as ""Dr. Stein"" in Carlsbruck, where he treats the cream of society while running a free clinic for the poor.  Of course at night he is back to pursuing his experiments, and if he needs a arm then amputating that of a pickpocket does not seem all that wrong.
The big twist this time around is that Victor has someone who actually WANTS to donate his brain: Karl (Oscar Quitak), the cripple who helped him escape execution.  Victor's new partner is the idealistic Dr. Hans Kleve (Francis Matthews), who used his knowledge of Stein's true identity to get his post.  Karl is successfully transplanted into his new body (Michael Gwynn), at which point he learns Victor wants to exhibit him to the medical community.  Poor Karl just wants to lead a ""normal"" life.  However, when he tries to escape he is beaten by the sadistic janitor (George Woodbridge).  His brain injured, Karl not only starts killing people, he has some cannibalistic impulses as well.  In the climax, Karl outs Victor, who is then attacked by his outraged charity patients.  Even though he is beaten to death, there is that spare body in the basement that looks a lot like Victor and Dr. Kleve does know the procedure...
""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" presents both Victor and the ""monster"" as more complex and sympathetic characters than the first Hammer film.  Certainly Jimmy Sangster's script is much, much better, with the idea that the former owner of all those body parts find out what has happened to them being a wonderful touch of irony.  This is one of the most thoughtful explorations of the ""Frankenstein myth.""  The only serious shortcoming in the film is that it is short on the violence.  But Cushing and Gwynn turn in fine performances that are hard to match in the Hammer films to come.",989452800,4,2171,4.801075268817204
