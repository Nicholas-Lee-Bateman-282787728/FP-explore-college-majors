2592563,5,B000FVRADY,I recieved backstage with Gene pitney today and it's wonderful! It played great on My tv-cd player with no problems. I did not have to do anything extra to excess the Dvd. Gene is enlightening on this Dvd with his voice and his music! Gene was an exceptional artist!,1170806400,4,266,4.448979591836735
2592564,5,B000FVRADY,"This dvd might not play in your dvd player unless you hack it using a code you may find online. My version is PAL although Amazon or it's seller advertised it as NTSC.

****This dvd is the same on stage program as ""It Hurts To Be In Love"" dvd therefore the same basic review. Gave five stars this time because of inclusion of 18 song hits cd. As with the other, if you can hack your dvd player, the quality is very good.****

The program is over one hour long and contains most of Pitney's hits including some songs he wrote for other singers including ""Hello Mary Lou"" (Rick Nelson), ""He's A Rebel"" (The Crystals) and ""Rubber Ball"" (Bobby Vee). His voice is in fine shape and both he and the audience are enjoying the show.

While the year of the concert isn't given, it does take place in his latter years (his hair is gray) and is probably representative of his on stage performances up to the time of his death.

Highly recommended for Gene's fans if they can get this dvd to play in their player.

Songs: Introduction (snippets of his hits from the concert) and then the complete versions of Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa, Last Chance To Turn Around, Backstage, Looking Through The Eyes Of Love, It Hurts To Be In Love, Mecca, If I Didn't Have A Dime, Half Heaven-Half Heartache, I'm Gonna Be Strong, Nobody Needs Your Love, Jamaica Farewell, The Angels Got Together, True Love Never Runs Smooth, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Only Love Can Break A Heart, I Must Be Seeing Things, I Wanna Love My Life Away, Hello Mary Lou, Rubber Ball, She's A Rebel, Oceans Away, She's A Heartbreaker, Town Without Pity, and Heavenly Stop (Intrumental).",1165536000,4,1646,4.510067114093959

2592571,1,B000FVRADY,"this is what happens when you wait until you are almost 100 yrs. old to do a dvd. why didn't the dells put this dvd out when they were in their 50's? I bought this dvd thinking I was going to have a bit of history especially after the untimely passing of Johnny Carter. I gave the dvd away. oh and all that cursing was very undignified. I was very,very disappointed. waste of my money! It need to be called THE DELLS: DONE LIVE FROM NEW YORK",1330041600,2,441,4.080459770114943
2592572,1,B000FVRADY,Why did I hate the DVD when I love the Dells?  Simply because their language was awful.  I'm not a prude but there was really no reason for it.  Their performance was lacking in itself as though they had stayed passed their prime.  They could not hit notes.  Overall I was very disappointed and most likely will not attempt to see them live.  We threw the DVD out.,1311033600,,364,4.279411764705882

I WANTED TO CAPTURE THIS EXPERIENCE AT HOME ON MY 72"" SAMSUNG HD TV.  I PURCHASED THIS VIDEO AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. AFTER ENDURING AN HOUR OF THIS TERRIBLE FORMAT, I THREW THE DVD IN THE TRASH.  THE ENTIRE PERFORMANCE IS DARK AND INDISTINGUISHABLE. THE AUDIENCE IS COMPLETELY WASHED OUT IN DARK BLUES AND YOU CAN HARDLY SEE DONNA SUMNMER ON THE STAGE IN DIM LIGHTING.  THERE IS ALSO A SYNC DELAY WITH THE WORDS WHICH IS UNBEARABLE.

2592577,1,B000FVRADY,"I have been an avid fan of the Mighty, Mighty Dells for generations!
But this DVD provided too much waay too late.  It was sad to watch the men I remember as lively and vivid in concert many years ago, and it is a pity that the soul singers I lovingly remember were not captured in their prime.  This attempt does them or their leagcy no real justice; it was a shell of their talent.  Too bad they could have not maybe told their story amid original renditions of their many hit songs or archived tapes.  The memories of the members in their more vibrant youth will remain in my heart and head as strongly as the wonder of the songs and harmonies.",1236556800,,647,4.235772357723577
2592578,1,B000FVRADY,"I listened to Pitney in the early 60's when he was popular.  I have his greatest hit CD.  When I saw this DVD, I was very anxious to see it.  When you listen/watch any nostalgic music, most of us prefer to listen to the tunes that  were sang in the old way, not revised versions that usually turn me off.  I have two big issues with this DVD.  One, his voice is not the same as before, unlike some other singers, such as Paul Anka, Neil Sedaka, etc, who never really lost their voice.  In addition, the arrangement of songs were terrible!  When you have a combination of these two deficiencies, what's left to listen to?  It is really the worst nostalgic performance I have ever listened.  I just can't fathom some reviews gave it high ratings!  There is just no way that I will ever want to listen to it again, so I threw in the garbage can where it belongs.",1229126400,,859,4.2407407407407405

Gene was in TOP FORM!!!  It was being filmed for PBS Television.  Also had the RARE pleasure to sit in on his rehearsal for the show earlier in the day!!!  Sat RIGHT upfront!!  Incredible performance!!  Gene is surely MISSED!!!",1224028800,4,382,4.449275362318841
2592580,1,B000FVRADY,"I love the Dells, but if you can no longer sound reasonably good as when you were in your prime, then I think it is time to retire.  I do think the group should retire NOW!",1220918400,2,172,3.7777777777777777
2592581,5,B000FVRADY,Solely enjoyed this DVD.  The picture and sound quality are crystal clear; you feel like you're right there.  Even after all these years singing the Dells sound great.  I'm so glad they decided for the first time to release a DVD of their concert performance.,1207353600,,259,4.711111111111111
2592582,3,B000FVRADY,"As a lifelong fan of the Dells, I was happy to have the opportunity to finally see them perform during a live concert.  Over the years, I have always followed their career, but was never able to see who were actually singing the songs.  Their best years of performing live have certainly passed them by; however, there are many fans who may still want to see the Mighty Mighty Dells perform during a live concert. The group's overall performance during this particular concert was very weak, especially while singing, ""Oh What A Night"" and ""A Heart Is A House For Love."" Those two songs, in particular, would be difficult for most 20-year-old performers to sing.  Marvin Junior and Johnnie Carter are definitely not the same lead singers they were back during the 1960s or even 10 years ago; at their current ages (over 70-year olds), I didn't expect them to be anyway.

This Rock and Roll Hall of Fame group has earned every right to continue to perform as they choose. They cannot keep up with a demanding schedule (on the road) as concert headliners; however, the Dells can still go out and  perform limited 20-minute sets as special guest stars. The Dells' band performance was really good, but the legendary singing group wasn't ready to perform the night this DVD was recorded--they were late getting to the concert and really had an off night!",1206403200,3,1350,4.727659574468085

2592584,5,B000FVRADY,"The Dells are excellent, as always.  Wish it was a longer peformance, but what can you expect from a group that has been together for over 54 years.  I would highly recommend this one to anyone.",1199145600,,194,4.361111111111111
2592585,4,B000FVRADY,"Good quality video..I enjoyed the viewing. It is amazing that these guys who are in their 70s or much older,can sing almost as good as 54 yrs ago.",1197936000,,146,4.25

2592587,4,B000FVRADY,"Its about time older groups like the Dells put out Concert material for their fans so that a video legacy can be had by the fans. It wasn't the best concert DVD but for anyone who is a fan of the groups it is well worth buying. The very first LP I ever purchaced as a child was by the Dells and they quickly and have always been my favorite group. Lacking was any video of TV appearances or concerts. This DVD fills the void. A better performance and DVD release would be from a show in the late 60's or early 70's called ""Soul"". Its was a PBS series hosted by Ellis Haislip that ran for several years and featured hour long Studio Concerts of such performers as the Dells, Delfonics, Moments, Al Green etc....Of course this was footage of these artist in their Prime. But this DVD concert fills a void for me for I now have the MIGHTY MIGHTY DELLS IN CONCERT!",1190073600,15,860,4.218181818181818

2592590,1,B000FVRADY,"I'm sorry, I love the Dells, but I would not recommend this DVD to anyone.  Unfortunately, they have just gotten too old to be singing anymore.

2592591,3,B000FVRADY,"The Dells happens to be one of my all times favorite true R&B group. Being this is their first DVD I was very disappointed in the poor quality in making it. The singings was somewhat liking but you have to remember these men are well up in age. If you are a true Dells fan then you will enjoy seeing them perform such songs as STAY IN MY CORNER,which allways a croud pleaser.",1184544000,10,375,4.1506849315068495
2592592,1,B000FVRADY,"This was a terrible DVD.  The Dells are a well respected group but the sound and the conduct of one or two members were unprofessional. The show would have been more appreciated if The Dells were musically represented by perhaps ""Boys to Men"" or a respected younger group. The Dells were one of my favorites in the 70's. They have contributed so much to music and I would like to see them gracefully retire.",1184284800,7,407,4.5
2592593,5,B000FVRADY,"The Dells have been singing together for 55 years (the last 47 years with the same members) and they still sound great!  Lead singer Marvin Junior's whiskey soaked pipes continue to captivate while the rest of the group (Verne Allison, Chuck Barksdale, Johnnie Carter and Michael McGill) show the youngsters what real harmonizing is.

This entertaining dvd includes such Dells classics as There Is, The Love We Had Stays on My Mind, Oh What a Night, Always Together, Give Your Baby a Standing Ovation, A Heart Is a House for Love, and Stay in My Corner.",1183334400,20,553,4.75

8127365,2,B000FVRADY,"This DVD literally brought me to tears because, as much as I loved the Dells, it almost caused me to lose respect for both them and the person who put this out! As powerful and phenomenal as their performance was on the TV show ""Soul!"" from March 15, 1972 or on the National Civil Rights Telethon, in which they did a medley of ""The Love We Had"" and ""Oh What A Night"" (both of which you can watch on YouTube), it was a big disappointment to see them at their worst and using profanity in an ill-advised attempt to ""let it all hang out"" like the young people do today! If you have any appreciation for the group that inspired Teddy Pendergrass and a host of others - skip this DVD and remember them when they set the standard for the many others who followed and check them out on YouTube! Next time, don't wait until a group is on its way out to record them live (both Marvin Junior and John E. (Johnny) Carter passed away a few years after this was released). Record them, as Elis Haizlip did with Soul!, when they are in their prime, so we can remember them for the great group they were!",1471305600,,1090,4.220095693779904
