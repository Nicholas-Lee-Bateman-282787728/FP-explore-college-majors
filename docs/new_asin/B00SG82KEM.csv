6983749,1,B00SG82KEM,"Just as with Hide and Creep, we were drawn in by the 3 star rating. This movie couldn't keep our interest. Maybe there was a plot but we shut it off about 10 minutes into it.",1468627200,,174,3.861111111111111

6983760,1,B00SG82KEM,"Wasn't really good and the porno scene doesn't add anything to the movie! (should be rated NC-17 vs TV-MA). The scenes didn't have any connectors so the story was hard to follow.

Props to the campiness though- CGI, script and acting were as I thought it'd be going in.",1463270400,2,269,4.489795918367347

6983763,3,B00SG82KEM,OMG what the heck did I just watch? It was like the Hindenburg burning horrible but I just kept watching till the end. It was jumpy confusing and silly but almost campy enough to be entertaining. I kinda liked it. Sort of. But I'm not telling anyone.,1461628800,3,250,4.340425531914893

6983767,1,B00SG82KEM,"It's been a week since I have watched this movie and I still don't know what the hell happened.  What do you get when you cross an Italian Soft Core Porno (well one scene), several witches that come back as demons, and a group of good guys consisting of a Vatican Exorcist, a Pagan, a Witch Doctor, and a scientist that won't believe a thing about the supernatural?  I don't know either but this movie tries it without success.",1448236800,3,427,4.3924050632911396

6983770,1,B00SG82KEM,Did not get past the first 5 minutes of the movie.  Nudity and violence very graphic. Way too much for me,1444867200,2,105,4.0

6983777,1,B00SG82KEM,"My rating might not mean all that much, but save yourself the 5 or 10 minutes I wasted. before this poorly acted ""movie"" turned into a mid-range porn video. I'm not easily offended, but this was just poorly done all around.",1438214400,,223,4.463414634146342

6983779,1,B00SG82KEM,Please. I wasn't expecting porn.,1437091200,2,32,5.6
6983780,2,B00SG82KEM,"First the story, it is a cool throwback to more Gothic, dark fantasy horror revolving around witches, persecution and revenge. You could place this situation in any European and Colonial setting and the story is the same. Females burned for being witches, town cursed, and wah-lah! Witches survive to get their vengeance. I actually love these kinds of films involving the occult and witches. The classic, old world concept of witches that may be insensitive to the modern day witch/Wiccan, but true to our ancient past's view of the hag/crone/wicked maiden.

Gerard Diefenthal manages to give the story some lift, creating iconic character types, Gothic settings, and plenty of drama mixed with gore. The film does move almost mirror-image to what I image the storyboard concept looked like. The transitions are blunt, quick changing and move the story quickly from moment to moment much like graphic novel/animation adaptations tend to do. For example one moment there is a woman in the kitchen preparing and in the next instant the scene transitions to her handing some homeless guy soup or something to eat with a wicked grin. The dialog is not over-burdening to the story, only crucial conversations that give the plot and sinister plans the witches have for the town, other characters idle chatter, or short scenes with just a couple of sentences. It allows for the action and suggested drama tell a lot of the story instead of some long speech like dialog delivered laboriously by the cast. It is overdubbed so be warned.

Now for me the nail in the coffin for this film isn't the overdubbed vs. subtitle choice, it is the CGI choices that were made to create the supernatural, witchy-ness side of the film. It is very low grade stuff, closer to Syfy on a dime. Think ""Witchville"". It is almost comical when those scenes take over the story. It all really shreds ""Darkside Witches"" momentum, and potential for being one of the modern day cult classics - you know the ones that are so bad they are good. Well the CGI here is just really bad and sad. That said, there are some really awesome, gory moments that use splattergore styled practical effects that scream Italian giallo! Really nice blood drenched moments. And the nudity is almost on soft-core porn level.

All this is why I had to watch the film a few times. At first I thought-""What is this crap?"", then the practical effects moments kicked in and I was like ""Heck yeah!"". Overall ""Darkside Witches"" is not gonna go over well for most horror fans, I mean this film is really gonna aim at a small select group of people who like the Syfy, CGI saturated stuff that uses gaming level computer effects. I am truly conflicted. Not because I am split on the film. I am conflicted because I liked the story, I love films about witches, and the gore and horror here, when practical choices are made, are awesome! Yet the overdubbed voices are so hokey and kill the seriousness of the dialog and scenes that it is troublesome. The CGI is, in all honesty, crap! And the transitions and smoothness of the story just moves to choppy and hurried to allow for any real connection with the characters.",1436227200,4,3154,4.741347905282331

6983783,5,B00SG82KEM,"I think too many trolls and haters here, this movie is cool and creepy. Sure it has an indie taste but cgi is pretty cool for the budget and there are lot's of boobs around. Loved the flying penis and the grand final, complex and clever plot, not the best acting and fx but overall real cool indie horror flick with a strong story and atmosphere.",1430611200,5,346,4.257575757575758
8698279,1,B00SG82KEM,"Try to picture what you'd get if you put together a jigsaw puzzle by randomly taking pieces from two or three different kits.  Or just watch ""Darkside Witches"" and save your imagination the bother.  This film uses CGI to fill in for missing pieces.  The English dubbing relies on about sixty words, and I'm including 'the', 'a', and 'not' in the count.",1490486400,,352,4.645161290322581
8698280,3,B00SG82KEM,"That was a lot of CGI most of it made a computer LOL. This is too much christian crap where the women and all witches are evil and its all black verses white.

8698286,5,B00SG82KEM,I feel the witches were justified. They try to remain hidden because of outsiders ignorance and fear from church influence. I recommend this film and watch with open mind!,1476144000,,171,4.931034482758621
