8245201,2,B0012DUCDY,"Whether you will like this video or not will depend upon what you are looking for.  Are you looking for a very tranquil video of flower pictures?  Something to soothe the nerves??  Then this may be for you.  If you are looking for something informative, this is not for you.  The opening to this video was somewhat reminiscent of the PBS series:  ""Secret Gardens of the World,"" a very delightful series! This video is nothing like that!  There is absolutely NO narration.  I could have taken a video camera and came up with the same thing.  In my opinion, that is what this video looked like.  The music was very soothing and did sound somewhat tropical but I wanted something that sounded Hawaiian.  I was greatly disappointed!

Apparently, these videos were used by a travel type agency.  This video does show the title of the Hawaiian Tropical Botanical Garden as they enter the garden.  Other than that, there is no explanation or description of anything.  The plants are not labeled.  Having over 30 years of gardening in a sub-tropical climate, I was able to identify many of the plants.  If not for that, I would not have known which plants were which.  These were not specimen plants, either (of course), which made some of the plants more difficult to identify.  Labels or an actual human voice identifying what was being seen would have made this a more enjoyable film. I wonder how many, over the years, who have watched this made the decision to include the Botanical Garden in their tour of Hawaii.

As I have stated, the music was somewhat tropical.  Since this was supposed to be a very tranquil presentation, I can understand the almost monotone music selection.  However, a livelier, more Hawaiian sounding selection would have done wonders for this work.  Sounds of birds would have helped this very uninspiring picture.",1394496000,,1838,4.7834394904458595

8245203,2,B0012DUCDY,"I hoped to learn something about this garden to decide whether or not to visit. However, there doesn't appear to be ANY narration at all. Just a long movie showing many flowers and waterfalls. I couldn't even figure out which island hosts the garden!! (The Big Island)  Pretty disappointing.",1372118400,,291,4.938775510204081
8245204,5,B0012DUCDY,This DVD actually does the garden justice. Ive visited the Big Island and every time we go this place is always a must see. From the sloping valley that leads down to Onomea Bay to the cascading waterfallls. This DVD will inspire any gardner to see this place in real life,1343606400,,272,4.352941176470588
