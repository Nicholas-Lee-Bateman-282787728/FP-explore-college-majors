8210871,3,B000TT4SNW,"The film quality was ok, due to it being made up of old clips from the 80's and 90's; and the DVD came to me in good condition. Also, although I found most of the guys attractive (at least when they were younger); some of the scenes were very cheesy and unrealistic. For example, a grown man doesn't ride a child's bike; and still get an allowance from his parents. Plus, the music apart from a little bit of pretty piano music sounded like bad 80's elevator music; and the little bit of acting there was in it was like that of a cheesy training video. However, I will keep this DVD and skip the parts I don't like; since it at least got the job done for me. That's really all that matters anyway, whenever anybody buys movies like this.",1458172800,,737,4.23404255319149
