7534179,3,B017V5YR3M,"In the distant year of 1985, the world is a utopia of global harmony. All cultures, races, etc., live together in perfect bliss. Into this wonderful world comes a mysterious cylinder, w/ an alien message. Scientific tests prove that the cylinder is from the planet Venus. Soon, a crew of scientists is dispatched to our sister planet to investigate. Along the way, the Venusian message is decoded, revealing a seemingly sinister, apocalyptic twist. Upon arrival on Venus, our heroes find a dark, haunted landscape. The film's highlight comes when the cosmonauts encounter a huge amoeba-like organism! This thing rivals THE BLOB in its menacing gooshy-ness! While somewhat cheeeze-tastic, FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS is a decent East German, science fiction oldie from 1960...",1449273600,4,772,5.336065573770492

7534194,4,B017V5YR3M,"Welcome to communist science fiction, filmed at DEFA in East Germany. I first encountered the film as a Mystery  Science Theater 3000 episode. The basic plot concerns a communication found in a asteroid, which concerns the planet Venus. So various people from all over the world, in a future egalitarian, communistic society, make their way to Venus, to discover its secrets. This includes a Japanese woman on the space ship, who is a nutritionist, her forbidden love, an African man, a robot that plays chess, a grumpy old man who is trying to decode the communication inside the asteroid, and many others. When they get to Venus, its a wasteland, with only ruined bits of a former civilization. They get chased around by black goo at some point, attacked by flying mechanical grasshoppers, and so on. There's some overarching didactic point to all this, which I don't want to reveal. Since the film was made at the beginning of the nuclear arms race, I bet you can guess what the take away message is, right?  Its not really a bad film at all, and if nothing else, will reveal what German science fiction was like in the early 1960s. Apparently they spent a lot of money on the film, producing it in color. This film is a good match for another DEFA communist film of its type, Eolomea.",1460160000,2,1288,4.644736842105263

7534197,1,B017V5YR3M,"This movie is lousy! The date says 2014 but it looks like it was made in the 1950's. Is even worse that your old science fiction B type movies. I will not recommend it to anyone not even my enemies, if I had some. Don't buy it, don't rent it. Period.",1455580800,,250,3.9215686274509802

8740753,3,B017V5YR3M,"Many low star reviews are ridiculous. This movie was not made in 2015; it was made in 1960 and RE-RELEASED in 2015. If you aren't familiar with a title and don't spend ten seconds consulting IMDb or the book ""Video Hound's Golden Retriever Movie Guide"" before renting/buying it, then you deserve to be stuck with something that you hate.
Anyway: Considering that this film was made in what was then called East Germany it is quite progressive. The characters are of several nationalities and races (there is only one female main character, though). Space flight was in its infancy in 1960, so there are many things and ideas depicted that are flat wrong. The film is photographed well. The special effects are dated, but hey, it's an old flick. This film was originally released in a longer format than available here, which makes me give it the three stars.
Overall, an interesting, campy title for sci-fi movie buffs; others need to avoid it.",1492819200,3,944,4.7975460122699385

8740760,1,B017V5YR3M,"In the description for this movie it had the year it came out as 2015. I found out later through a simple google search that
it actually came out in 1960. A 55 year difference. I would have never had any interest in watching this movie had I known that. I saw all of the first 5 minutes before I realized that Amazon got it wrong, unfortunately this was not the first time that has happened. What a waste of $2; if I want to throw my money away I prefer it not be to Amazon :(",1468800000,,476,3.917525773195876
