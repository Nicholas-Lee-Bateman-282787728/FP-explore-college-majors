6622015,5,B00NARLV8K,"The sixth season of Happy Days was #4 in t.v. rankings the year it aired. Still in the show's prime years and before Ron Howard left, this season contains some of the show's greatest episodes. This includes the three part episode where the gang saves Marion's Uncle's dude ranch, the Christmas episode with Fonzie's father, and the two-part Fonzie's funeral and stolen melodies (with leather) amongst others.

The DVD is superb with outstanding remastered picture quality, complete run times and as far as I can tell, all of the casts' music performances are intact! They even secured the rights to the twist playing on the t.v. in stolen melodies.

Hopefully we'll be seeing seasons 7-11 soon!",1417824000,24,694,4.974137931034483
6622016,5,B00NARLV8K,This was a gift. Recipient was excited to get it. Hasn't watched it yet.,1417737600,,72,4.214285714285714
6622017,5,B00NARLV8K,We pre-ordered this because we know all the shows and think they're great!  Can't wait to see them again!,1412640000,3,105,4.526315789473684
6622018,4,B00NARLV8K,"Happy Days Season 6 - It took a long time for Season 5 and 6 to come out, because the cast did not get their pay for the DVD release, so they sued for their cut.  Paramount CBS FOX said they would not release anymore happy Days seasons after the fourth season because of this.  But the fans were adamant to get more Happy Days... So THANK YOU to all of you who fought to get more seasons out on DVD.  Here are some of my favorite Episodes from Season 6... Christmas Time .... The Fonz's father delivers him a Christmas present, which forces the Fonz to deal with neglect from his father.  He receives a very cool robe from his father.  Another episode, Mork Returns, Robin Williams final episode on Happy Days.  Westward Ho Part 1, 2 & 3 - it seems like Season 4, 5 & 6 always began with a 3 part episode pilot for the seasons.  Season 7 has a wedding episode... And is Richie & Ralph Malph's last season on happy Days as a regular... After Season 7, as far as I am concerned... So ended Happy Days even though they went to seasons 8-11... I hope this did not offend anyone, I was just giving off my knowledge and opinion.  I am waiting for season 7 to complete my collection... Please... Another season please...

Fun Facts: Happy Days Spun off 4 series... 3 of the series got aired.  The 4th was a flop before airing the pilot episode... The failure was: The Fonz Show... And the three spin offs were... La'verne & Shirley, Mork & Mindy & Joanie Loves Chachi! Mork & Mindy in my opinion was the best spin of show from Happy Days...",1411862400,23,1533,4.237113402061856
6622019,4,B00NARLV8K,"So if you like to watch Happy Days to see Ritchie and Fonzie and the rest of the gang and don't care if the original music is replaced by generic music like it was in season 5,then this set is for you.

WARNING - In fact, on the back cover near the bottom in microscopic fine print it says "" Some episodes may be editted from the original network versions. Music has been changed for the home entertainment version""

What is really strange(good) this season is that you can hear Fats Domino's version of 'Blueberry Hill' in the episode Casanova Cunningham, but very low in the background ,until the last few notes, and you can also hear part of Chubby Checker's 'The Twist' on the Stolen Meoldies episode. But for the most part it just feels that all of the music has just been left out, rather than changed, you can see teenagers dancing at Arnold's to very low generic non vocal music or no music at all, which looks really weird. The only music you really hear is the opening and closing theme song 'Happy Days' and the mediocre attempts by Anson Williams, and usually it's only a few lines from a song that he's already sung in previous seasons. And not to be forgotten is Susie 'Leather' Quatro performing the new dance hit 'Do The Fonzie', now how did that get past the music censors?

The Fonz is the key selling point of this show, and you can tell by his prominent appearance of the cover of this DVD, but even after this series ended, he went on to have an illustrious career, so here's some interesting facts about Henry Winkler that you might have not been aware of.

-Henry Franklin Winkler was born on October 30, 1945, in Manhattan, New York. His parents, Harry Irving and Ilse Anna Maria Winkler, were Jewish immigrants who avoided the German Holocaust, moving to the US in 1939.
-His first major film role was in The Lord's of Flatbush (1974) in which he played a member of a Brooklyn gang.
-The motorcycle he rode on Happy Days (1974) was the same motorcycle Steve McQueen rode in the famous motorcycle scene at the end of The Great Escape (1963).
-While making a documentary about dyslexia, Winkler himself found, at age 31, that he is dyslexic.
-Received an Order of the British Empire award (OBE) from Queen Elizabeth II (April, 2011) in recognition of his work with British children with learning challenges, via his My Way! Campaign
-His first ride on the ""Happy Days"" motorcycle resulted in him crashing into the sound-van and then onwards the bike was put onto a board-on-wheels that was pulled along.
-He produced and directed several television shows and movies, most notably MacGyver (1985) and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996).
-Off-screen, Henry has been married since 1978 to Stacey Winkler (nee Weitzman) with whom he has three children

There have also been musical substitutions throughout the series due to copyrighted material being unavailable on this release.

6622169,4,B00NARLV8K,"The last time I'd seen any of these episodes was in re-runs 20 years ago.  I had remembered them as corny but bought this DVD set, anyway.

When I watched these episodes on DVD, I found they had more plot and were more entertaining than I expected.

I'm glad I bought this DVD set.",1438905600,5,281,4.166666666666667
6622180,5,B00NARLV8K,I loved the entire dvd. It brought back a lot of good memories. I highly recommend it for fans of the show.,1438732800,,107,3.909090909090909

6622184,5,B00NARLV8K,"I don't care what you say, this season did NOT jump the shark. Oh, that's right, that's because it happened back in season 5, literally. But figuratively, I think all seasons of Happy Days are so fun to watch, and since I grew up on it, I would never say this series ""jumped the shark"" it was all fantastic!",1437004800,3,307,4.220338983050848
6622185,5,B00NARLV8K,"Remember when a family sitcom was really a family sitcom?  My favorite TV show of all time.  With the seasons coming out on DVD, its given me the opportunity to share Happy Days with my kids.  My son is the only one in his 7th grade class that knows who the Fonz is.  Most of his teachers aren't familiar with the Fonz.  Crazy!  I hope his friends and teachers are reading this review - because they need to get familiar with the Cunningham's and the Fonz and watch a few seasons of this classic TV sitcom.

The DVD transfer is fine.  Some episodes transfer better than others, but I'm please with the quality.  I haven't noticed any scenes or music deleted from the DVD release - but for what its worth, its just good to have Happy Days at my disposal anytime.",1436400000,,761,4.302816901408451
6622186,5,B00NARLV8K,"Heeeeeey!. The Fonz wouldn't think it's cool that Seasons beyond Season 6 are still to be released of this American classic TV show, and anyone reading this review will have to consider their level of patience before buying this show. The show is so good that I cannot believe that further releases have not happened since December because of low sales of Season 6. I'd be confident in saying that I'd be just one of many people who'd 'pre-order' further seasons of 'Happy Days' as soon as able.
So any-one reading this review, please buy Seasons 3-6 of 'Happy Days' as soon as you can if you don't already have them. (Seasons 1 & 2 are ok, but if you have to choose which seasons, season 3 onwards are my recommendation!).",1435881600,,723,4.526717557251908
6622187,5,B00NARLV8K,I'll keep collecting this classic show on DVD as long as they keep putting them out. Five stars!,1434931200,6,96,4.388888888888889

6622202,4,B00NARLV8K,I have been buying the Happy Days seasons as they come out. In my mind the first 7 seasons and possibly the last 2 are the best.  Season 6 has some of the best episodes ever made.  There are better years but if you like Happy Days and you want to collect their DVDs you need to get this.,1424304000,,287,3.847457627118644

6622222,3,B00NARLV8K,Great show but just like the other seasons you can spot the butchering because of music rights(one scene you see Leather beging a song in the mens room of all places and it fades out after about 3 seconds - pretty blatant cut there).  Kind of pathetic that it's about 15 years after DVDs were invented and movie/tv companies are still doing through the whole music rights crapola.  Thats just really REALLY sad....,1421452800,10,414,4.657534246575342
