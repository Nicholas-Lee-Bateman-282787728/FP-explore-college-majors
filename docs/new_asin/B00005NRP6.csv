7947763,5,B00005NRP6,This DVD has been the favorite of both my sons now :) Worth every penny! Relaxing to listen to compared to other children's TV.,1447027200,,127,4.333333333333333
7947764,1,B00005NRP6,"I'm amazed that people haven't wised up to the deceptive marketing practices used in the titles of videos like Baby Einstein and So Smart! There are no data to support these videos making kids 'smarter' or more like Einstein. Unfortunately, many parents read the title and subconsciously (or not so subconsciously) decide that if the video is called this, it must make kids smarter. Think about it - would you be equally inclined to buy this video if it was called ""Ketchup sandwich?"" I would venture a guess that most consumers wouldn't.

Our local PBS station carries a lot of them. These videos are slow-moving and simple - which is fine for small children. They're probably no better than most other cartoons for pure (and questionable) entertainment purposes IF your child likes them (which our kids don't). However, don't buy them thinking you're doing something good for your kids. Reading, drawing, building with blocks - those are mind-building activities for little minds. Watching TV is not and should not be considered good for children no matter how the stuff put on the screen is marketed. Instead, I hope that consumers exercise a little consumer activism and stop buying things that may trick well-meaning parents into thinking they're doing something good for their children.",1305417600,,1292,5.065727699530516
7947765,5,B00005NRP6,"I have to buy this.  My cable system had it on for a few weeks and I was able to play it for my 16 month old daughter every day.  Then it suddenly disappeared from my viewing choices and she keeps saying ""bear hiding,"" ""bear hiding.""  Even in the middle of the night I swear I hear her saying ""bear hiding.""  What a cute little blue bear hiding behind the box!  She just loves this.  I have already bought First Words, and that is great too.",1216080000,,441,4.069767441860465
7947766,5,B00005NRP6,"I received this as a gift from my first child and now have replaced it in DVD format for my second.  This is a very good first video for young children, it is well paced and doesn't overwhelm the senses with too much stimulation, visual or auditory.  Each color is reinforced with basic words that most toddlers are beginning to use.  I would also recommend this to those with small children trying to learn English as well.  My 5 year old likes to watch along with his brother because he finds it relaxing.

We also bought the Baby Einsten series, Shapes and Colors, but it was too much for my first son to handle and I am going to wait until my second one is over 2 before letting him what.  The Baby Einstein series is visual overstimulating in comparison.",1166140800,,759,4.385714285714286
7947767,5,B00005NRP6,"Having used to fast paced shows, My son and I found this too slow and boring at first.  We used to fall asleep and yawn in the middle of the show.  But after a couple of watches, we just fell into this.  I realized that learning should come slowly to absorb it better and stay there for a lifetime.  Learning shouldn't be rushed.  My son has learned to differentiate and sort his colors in an instant.  He could arrange a pile of blocks in one color. Amazing it is.

The video story tells a color at a time.  It's a digital boardbook that doesn't make use of puppets.  It has diecut illustrations just like what you see in boardbooks but has come to life.  Illustrations tend to buildup gradually.  This gives your child to guess what's up next.  My son would watch even when at play.  He'd always ask for this as soon as he wakes up.  It's a good learning tool while the mind is still fresh from all the stresses of play.  We loaned this from the library, and is now purchasing a copy for my son.  I highly recommend this.  It's worth every penny.",1118793600,2,1048,4.238578680203045
7947768,5,B00005NRP6,"This is a charming video with very cute pictures of animals.  They look like they were made from shapes cut out and pasted together.  It begins: ""Once upon a time there was a green grasshopper who liked to hop in a green grassy meadow.""  This is one of the few So Smart videos that actually has words spoken.  The voice is a very nice voice to listen to.  There are nice sound effects, like birds chirping.  The music is great.  The colors shown are green, purple, yellow, orange, blue, red, and pink.  Each color has a different story and almost everything in that story is that particular color with different shades of the color.  Very cute.  I have reviewed all the other So Smart videos.",1116028800,2,692,4.464
7947769,2,B00005NRP6,This video is very boring and SLOW.  I have a 22 month old and it didn't hold his attention 10 minutes.  It seems like someone could have made this on his or her computer and passed it off as entertainment.  It may be good for very small babies but not for ones that are used to Baby Einstein and things that captivate their attention.,1082937600,2,335,4.203125
7947770,5,B00005NRP6,"I bought this based on good Amazon reviews, and our 6-month-old daughter is absolutely captivated.  She has been watching it about two times a week for about six weeks, and watches the entire half hour from start to finish without losing interest.  My 17-month-old nephew saw it for the first time at our home, and he asked to watch it twice in a row, so it apparently also goes over well with older, active children.
The artwork, storylines, and music are simply charming, and the narrator's voice is very soothing.  I think of the Baby Einstein series as putting my daughter into a ""wiggly"" mood,  whereas she seems to concentrate and become contemplative when she watches So Smart.
Personally, I prefer the So Smart series to the Baby Einsteins (Mozart and Bach) we also have, because the production is professional, and does not seem as if it were created in the basement of someone's home.  I would categorize this as ""highbrow"" baby entertainment, if there is such a thing.",1059004800,7,979,4.769230769230769
7947771,5,B00005NRP6,"What a wonderful DVD!  As a mother of 3 children, the only time I have to sit down is with my two youngest children, ages 10 months and and 3 years old, is for the duration of a DVD or Video.
The So Smart Colors DVD offers soothing music and colorful images that keep both the children's attention at the same time. It is most favorable to my 10 month old, who coo's and ca's when it comes on. She will only watch 4 videos, The two So Smart DVD's we have (Shapes is another must have) and the Baby Know-It-All Videos, that are reality based with children.  But as far as other animated videos like Baby Newton, she hasn't really been interested in the collections other than So Smart.
The extras and games are perfect for our 3 year old. They help to follow up on what has learned.  You also get the music too.
It's perfect for music only activities, and extends the life of the product, adding considerable value.",1029369600,8,914,4.3023255813953485
