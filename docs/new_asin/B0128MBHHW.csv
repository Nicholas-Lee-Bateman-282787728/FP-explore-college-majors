8725603,1,B0128MBHHW,Disney needs to make a real version of this with better packaging. And I'm disappointed that it's not a real official product of disney and a bootleg version.,1526169600,,158,4.678571428571429
8725604,1,B0128MBHHW,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!  It looks as though Amazon caught this problem.  My wife recieved these for Christmas and upon inspection of the box, everything looked great.  However,  I noticed about 75 typos in the title listings.  Very strange.  The legal information on the side of the box also had a ton of typos.  We did not open the box because of the red flags and searched about the product online.  Evidently these are pirated dvds.  Walt Disney stated on one website that they are illegal and some won't even play.  The audio will not match the animation and some have asian subtitles.  Another review stated that the artwork on the dvds are cheap and not true Walt Disney artwork.  I did not open the package as we were skeptical but this is what I found through my own research.  As I said it seems as if Amazon may have caught this but if in fact it does become available again, DO NOT BUY!!!! Merry Christmas all!",1451001600,34,917,4.419161676646707
8725605,1,B0128MBHHW,"Set Looks really Cool in the metal treasure chest it comes in and my daughter was so excited to receive this BUT what a BIG disappointment when we found out that Some of them worked fine but several were in foreign language (Chinese or Spanish) and we couldn't get them to switch to English, some didn't play at all, some skipped and Most had Chinese writing all over DVDs. They don't stand behind there product, no replacements or refund.",1447977600,35,439,4.569620253164557
8725606,1,B0128MBHHW,"My husband ordered this for our daughter for her birthday. It came in a timely manner, most of the reviews of it on other sites have been people complaining about the shipping time. That was not the problem we had with ours. He picked this up from the post office today and let her have it early, just like me he was excited to see her reaction and just couldn't wait. The first couple played just fine, then I put in Aladdin and it started skipping and freezing very badly after about 35 minutes. There is no damage at all to the disc and now my daughter is upset because I am going to be talking to my husband about returning it. For the price of this, I am not taking any chances for any of the other discs to freeze or skip when they should be new discs. Also, the art on most of the discs looks cheap almost like they are bootlegged copies. Very disappointed...",1442534400,47,866,4.191616766467066
