7992041,4,B00009N1VS,"This is one of the most bizarre flicks I have seen, so weird off the all and eerie it stands out more than a lot of indie films I've seen. A skeleton faced ghoul uses black opium to brainwash people into his occult philosophy.
Stars John Brodie who I remember as the reptile guy from the documentary ""Horror Business"" and directed by the wacky Ron Atkins also in that documentary. The film is used at college drug parties at PSU as one of the initiations into new frats, to freak out the pledge. It's wacky, weird and a serious head trip. If you like films that are really different you may dig it!",1198540800,2,598,4.300884955752212
7992042,1,B00009N1VS,"This is not a Stan Brakhage movie (the 3 minute ""Dark Night of the Soul"" by Stan Brakhage has not been released in a DVD for public purchase) but a horror movie made in late 1990's.",1191628800,2,181,4.055555555555555
