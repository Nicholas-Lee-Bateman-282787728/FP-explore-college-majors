7101070,3,B00VQRFCUO,"MGM released the elusive The Stranger films theatrically so it's disappointing to me that MGM didn't release this on DVD instead of Warner Bros' sub-par DVD-R pressing, 16x9 enhanced for widescreen 1.78:1. (A Stranger In Town was shot in 1.85:1, The Stranger Returns in 1.66:1, The Silent Stranger in 1.85:1.) I have the MGM DVDs of the Leone/Eastwood trilogy, Duck You Sucker, The Sabata trilogy, Navajo Joe and others and MGM did an excellent, quality presentation. Pride in quality shows. Turner has a US copyright to the three The Stranger films. Turner Classic Movies ran the first two movies about 5 years ago and their broadcast copies looked better than these DVDs but they haven't aired them since, reasons unknown. This is strictly a no frills package. There is one trailer. No galleries of stills, posters and Italian locadinas, closed-captions or subtitles, no deleted footage and most unforgivable of all, no commentary or interview with Tony Anthony. This was the perfect opportunity to include one after all these years and now this is never going to happen. I can't really recommend this bargain basement set unless you're a die-hard Stranger or a Tony Anthony fan. The plus side is you get three films for one price. MGM and Warner don't hold the rights for the European versions. The German DVD of the collection is in Italian, German and English and is on three discs. The 4th film, Get Mean, is due from Blue Underground http://www.getsmean.com/",1433462400,16,1465,4.983673469387755

8710904,2,B00VQRFCUO,"I purchased this for The Silent Stranger, a movie I watched several times on Star Channel back in 76/77, before it became The Movie Channel.  For that, plus having the two previous movies, I am thankful.  I was pleased to be able to revisit that film and some of the images/moments that stuck with me for almost 40 years.  However, these are bad films.  The production values are clumsy, the stories are inane, pacing is tedious (even for the time), the music is annoying, performances are substandard, etc. etc.  I find it irritating that people will excuse films like this with any number of rationalizations while, in some other breath, will trash American films just because.  Intellectual thought is apparently not a requirement among film enthusiasts.

As a side note, which does not affect my appreciation of the films, the first and second films are rated R, but not one of the three is actually heavier than a PG--then or now: no sex, no gore, no foul language, little violence.  This is another case of the MPAA being cavalier with their ratings (see also the ""director's cut"" of Amadeus, now rated R because of the brief inclusion of bare breasts, and Hitchcock's original Psycho, rated R for reasons I can't fathom--especially since the movie was okay for pre-MPAA audiences and ran uncut on syndicated TV in the '70s and '80s).",1487980800,2,1340,4.7956521739130435

8710908,5,B00VQRFCUO,"Warner Archive has finally given actor Tony Anthony's STRANGER trilogy a decent release .  Some of the reviewers seem to be quibbling  about the lack of extras and the visual quality but at least Euro fans can view the films as DVD-R's in their 1.85 widescreen ratios and can enjoy their catchy music scores in Dolby Stereo.  Director Lewis Vance aka Luigi Vanzi's 'A STRANGER IN TOWN' aka 'A DOLLAR BETWEEN THE TEETH' aka 'UN DOLLARO TRA I DENTI' -1966  tried to emulate Director Sergio Leone's stranger, Clint Eastwood, by placing Anthony in a cat and mouse game for a huge gold shipment which is also being sought after by Mexican Bandit Anguila played beautifully by American actor Frank Wolff.  The movie relies on its visuals and its catchy music score by Benedetto Ghiglia as the film has little dialogue between the actors. The film is beautifully photographed by Marcello Masciocchi limiting the action to the claustrophobic enclosure of the small encampment .  It did so well at the box office in Europe and in the drive-in circuit in the US that an official sequel was made in 'THE STRANGER RETURNS' aka 'SHOOT FIRST, LAUGH LAST' aka 'UN UOMO, UN CAVALLO, UNA PISTOLA'-1967 .  This time Anthony is up against bandit El Plein played with unrelenting evil by muscle man Dan Vadis who is looking for a stagecoach carrying tons of gold.  The film again has a catchy music score , this time by Stelvio Cipriani  and great images by Marcello Masciocchi  culminating in a great shootout in a coffin factory.between Vadis and Anthony.  The third film, 'THE SILENT STRANGER'aka 'A STRANGER IN JAPAN' aka 'LO STRANIERO DI SILENZIO' -1969 was held from release for over five years and was severely tampered with in its American release with action scenes edited and more humor injected.  The catchy score is agsin by Stelvio Cipriani and the visual style by Mario Capriotti is hampered with unnecessary narration by Anthony throughout the film.  At the time, the Euro Western was blending East meets West cowboy/samurai styles in their plots.  This time ,the Stranger goes to Japan in search of a reward for deliverance of an ancient scroll.  The outlandish plot sort of paves the way for the next Stranger incarnation Director Fernando Baldi's 'GET MEAN' -1975 which is having a Blu-ray release by Blue Underground as I am writing this.  All three films are presented in nice, clear transfers for the first time.  One of the reviewers said that Turner Classic Movies aired the first two films in better condition than this release and I beg to differ.  I saw that broadcast and their images were fuzzier with the sound not as dynamic as these releases plus 'THE SILENT STRANGER' was never given a proper release and was paraded around with inferior bootleg copies for the past decade.  Yes, the extras are limited to one US trailer for 'THE STRANGER RETURNS' but this two disc set is perfect for now until Blue Underground or another company comes along with more gold for our Stranger. These films are extremely entertaining and a fitting tribute to Mr. Anthony and Mr. Vanzi's contributions to the Euro Western.",1450051200,12,3114,4.830508474576271
