1345889,5,B00004RYKP,"I was scanning through the tv stations and I came upon this movie. I wouldnt normally stop for a movie I don't know about but I just took a chance and thought Id try it for a few minutes. Well, I never stopped watching. It was such a wonderful movie and I wouldnt hesitate to watch it again.",1520294400,,291,4.0344827586206895

1345896,4,B00004RYKP,Cute story. Nicely done.,1518134400,,24,5.25
1345897,5,B00004RYKP,Loved it as much as I did the first time!!!  Didn't mind that the political senarios weren't all realistic....ie.  in one day getting just his cabinet (what happen to congress passing necessary budget changes to make it really happen?) to agree to $650 million change!!!  Or that most of what we saw Dave do as president was just public appearances.  Still. very entertaining.,1517875200,,376,4.920634920634921
1345898,5,B00004RYKP,"Always a fabulous movie. I was a bit disappointed this wasn't in Prime, so we had to rent it for a small fee.",1517616000,,109,3.782608695652174

1345900,5,B00004RYKP,This is such a great movie!,1517184000,,27,3.6666666666666665
1345901,2,B00004RYKP,"To be clear: I LOVE this film! I actually have a copy somewhere, but misplaced it, and wanted to watch with a friend, so ordered it on here. What I DIDN'T like was the quality of the streaming copy. It's supposed to be HD, but looks like it was dubbed off a VHS tape. Also, the sound was 'off' from the video here and there, which is very distracting, esp. during close dialogue. I would go as far as to request a credit, it was so bad, but there's no device for that on here. I recommend buying a copy of this on blu ray, or even DVD, it's that good of a film. We all wish we had a president like this in real life!",1517184000,,616,3.8968253968253967
1345902,5,B00004RYKP,Clever plot idea with Kevin Klein and Sigourney Weaver.  President has a stroke and Klein is the look alike that takes his place unbeknownest to the public. Great motion picture IMO. Recommended,1517097600,,194,5.0625
1345903,5,B00004RYKP,"The movie is enjoyable, happy, fun. We own it on VHS and couldn't wait to get it on DVD to add to our collection.  One of our favorites.",1516665600,,136,3.857142857142857

1345905,5,B00004RYKP,"We watch this movie at least a couple times a year - always enjoy with fun plot, great acting.  I already have DVD but wanted to support the movie more so BOUGHT Amazon Stream.  The PICTURE is TERRIBLE!  ORANGE-COLORED FACES, POOR PICTURE, POOR SOUND!",1514419200,,251,4.659090909090909
1345906,5,B00004RYKP,Never tire of this movie.  So lovely.,1514332800,,37,4.285714285714286
1345907,5,B00004RYKP,I enjoy this movie every time I watch it. Great casting and scripting. Love watching the transition of our government from an immoral and lying entity to one that cares about the people. Still extremely relevant today.,1512777600,,218,4.918918918918919
1345908,5,B00004RYKP,"This a funny and light comedy. The plot is well done. I can't believe I've never seen the movie in its entirety. I really enjoyed it- a good feel movie at a time where nothing is great about the actual political mileau. Moreover, a 90's movie that is much better than most these days.  Watch it.",1510876800,,295,4.267857142857143

1345911,5,B00004RYKP,Terrific movie.  Inspiring for what a President could do.,1507334400,,57,5.333333333333333

1345913,5,B00004RYKP,An all-time favorite! Love this movie!,1506729600,,38,5.5
1345914,5,B00004RYKP,This is one of my all-time favorite movies with a fun political twist.  It is particularly relevant in a time when we are finally experiencing a U.S. President who is not a career politician.  Timely and fun. :),1506297600,,211,4.526315789473684
1345915,5,B00004RYKP,"This is just a super fun, cute, feel good movie.  Start to finish it's fun and has great heart.  It's nice to watch a movie where teh good guy is good and there is a happy ending.",1505174400,,179,3.810810810810811

1345919,5,B00004RYKP,Good movie.  Enjoyed it very much.  Good actors!,1504137600,,48,4.875
1345920,1,B00004RYKP,"The streaming video quality of this movie was horrible.  A full quarter of the time, it was out of focus.  The movie was wonderful, but Amazon's service was pitiful!  Very unusual, but a disappointing movie night with the family nonetheless!",1502582400,,241,4.975
1345921,5,B00004RYKP,A good movie,1501977600,,12,3.3333333333333335
1345922,5,B00004RYKP,"This movie is similar to ""Moon Over Parador"" (1988) Where Richard Dreyfuss plays an actor playing the recently deceased president; only a little closer to home. This time it is the President of the US that over indulges and becomes comatose. Kevin Kline ""French Kiss"" (1995) gets occupy the presidential position for the stability of the country.
-----------------------------------------------

The behind the scenes people that actually handle the President spotted a job recruiter who acts like the President, in commercials. And eventually recruited him to substitute for the President ad a diversion. The President that is on a ""recreational"" tour has a debilitating stroke. This leaves the Chief of Staff, Frank Langella ""Sphinx"" (1980) the opportunity to place a fake President in place instead of the Vice President. You can guess the rest when the substitute teaches us. My favorite scene is where Charles Grodin ""Heaven Can Wait"" (1978) is helping prepare the national budget.",1501200000,,986,5.402597402597403
1345923,5,B00004RYKP,what a great movie!,1501200000,,19,4.0

1345926,1,B00004RYKP,I was not warned that there is absolutely NO WAY to turn off the stupid subtitles and they are very annoying...I am going to return this product...I am disgusted to be sure...,1497916800,,175,4.5
1345927,4,B00004RYKP,fine,1496880000,,4,4.0
1345928,5,B00004RYKP,"Wonderful chemistry between Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver. Great ""political"" film that calls out the not so great elements of the government but keeps things light and fluffy at the same time.",1496793600,,195,5.125
1345929,5,B00004RYKP,"Good movie, good story. Entertaining",1496016000,,36,6.4
1345930,5,B00004RYKP,"The year is 2016, and Dave is the President of the United States of America, but this is just a liberal fantasy, so the problems facing America aren't the ones Trump faces.",1495584000,,172,4.40625
1345931,5,B00004RYKP,It's a fun movie. If you're looking for a sophisticated political drama with intrigue then this ain't your kinda movie. It's not crazy funny and you can see the ending coming from the cheap seats but...its OK. It works. You'll find yourself watching it from the middle when you find it on TV because.....you just do.,1495152000,,316,4.660714285714286
1345932,4,B00004RYKP,This classic Kevin Kline movie has a funny (albeit predictable) story line and a terrific supporting cast. We enjoy it as a multi-generation-friendly movie that just makes you feel good.  And Kevin Kline makes me laugh out loud in the factory!,1494806400,,243,4.926829268292683
1345933,5,B00004RYKP,Always great!! Fun to watch,1494720000,,27,4.6

1345935,1,B00004RYKP,"The film was blurry and because of this poor quality, I stopped it after three minutes, approximately. Amazon should not charge my account!!  Yet, they did",1493251200,,155,4.961538461538462
1345936,5,B00004RYKP,What a classic!  Greatly refreshing look at what politics could possibly be like.  Kevin Kline brings such a breeze of fresh air to the role.  I love the way his outlook and behaviors persuade jaded politicians to remember who they serve: humanity.,1493251200,,248,4.857142857142857
1345937,5,B00004RYKP,Bought Dave and Fences-seen Dave many times before but my copy turned up missing. Great movie and excellent flawless print.,1491868800,,123,5.2
1345938,5,B00004RYKP,Just a very beautiful romance set in a rather complicated presidential  setting with a wonderful twist.....family safe for children over eight with no real language or sex scenes to embarrassingly negotiate.  Patriotic theme is sweet and plenty of humor as well.,1491523200,,262,5.365853658536586
1345939,1,B00004RYKP,There was no DVD inside!!!  Case all sealed in clear plastic wrap!  Even had security tape!!  But no DVD inside!!!,1491523200,,114,4.6

1345942,5,B00004RYKP,Dave is one of my favorite movies. I purchased four different copies of this movie on standard DVDs but every one I bought needed the user to turn off the closed captioning function. These faulty DVDs were purchased ove over three years. all of them had the same problem. I took a chance that the closed caption problem would not exist on the Blu-Ray version and I was correct. Great movie on a great medium.,1490745600,,408,4.453333333333333

1345953,5,B00004RYKP,It's what you hope a real president can do.,1487635200,,43,3.888888888888889
1345954,4,B00004RYKP,"Dave, a regular citizen who happens to look like the U.S. president, suddenly finds himself substituting for the president. He makes a better president than the real one. It just goes to show that often times John Q Public sees things clearer than the political leaders that are in office. This is one of my favorite movies and I should have given it five stars.",1487462400,,362,4.584615384615384

1345959,4,B00004RYKP,"A reasonably clever movie about the romps in the White House by a stand-in President. I liked the light-hearted presentation and with the primary ensemble, well, I can only imagine the fun they had in filming this movie. Very good production quality replicating the interior of the White House, too - see the extras!",1486425600,,316,4.87037037037037

1345969,5,B00004RYKP,"""Dave"" is a wonderful movie, funny and moving.  It is a love letter to Washington, the White House, the spirit of public service, and most of all the office of the Presidency; I intend to watch it on Inauguration Day.  Kevin Kline is superb, as just a plain guy who wants to do good and is drafted into a situation where he really can.",1484524800,,335,4.21875

1345999,4,B00004RYKP,This is a fun spirited movie with great humor with Kevin Kline. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it is very careful to stay away from the hot trigger topics that would divide people of different ideology.  It does a great job of letting you see some of how it might be like as a POTUS and yet the topics it uses for conflict we well chosen to present the concepts needed for the plot and yet not be a certain leaning virtiol lesson. Either side of the aisle should enjoy this film for that very reason.,1477785600,,517,4.17

1346008,4,B00004RYKP,"This is one of those movies that I missed 23 years ago when i was busy getting married, having kids and working full time plus going to school at night.  My friend recently said they couldn't believe I never saw it or heard of it.  So, as I've spent years watching oldie but goodies...I rented it, and I really enjoyed it, it was a very heartfelt movie.  Kevin Kline was excellent in it, he was my favorite, Sigourney was so so in it, but it truly was a great story. A classic 90's movie with a little corny humor and romance, but it was refreshing to watch something with NORMAL everyday actor and actresses and not fake face, fake body woman, and no arrogant uppity male actors.  Everyone should watch this movie as it has a lot of reminders of honesty and ethics in politics that people should consider in light of our current, crappy Trump/Clinton campaign going on right now (October 2016).",1476230400,,895,4.47239263803681

1346069,5,B00004RYKP,"If you are looking for a funny, family, movie, I would watch this one! It is an older movie but I feel that children as well as adults will fall in love with the story line. Dave is an ordinary person who is suddenly in a position of power and deals with it in a humorous and fun way. He is the typically nice guy who runs an agency and has a normal life. He is laid back and really has never had anything surprising happen to him before. The only thing is that he happens to look almost identical to the President of the United States. When the president wants to sneak away with his mistress, he is recruited by the secret service to act like he is the President. Then, the president has a stroke and Dave is hired on more of a permanent basis. Over all, it is a cute family movie that will have you laughing. I really like how they developed the characters personalities. Overall, I highly recommend it, especially if you want to watch a movie with your family.",1466467200,,964,4.216216216216216

1346124,5,B00004RYKP,"I've lost count of how many times I've watched ""Dave"". Though I'm sure that this scenario could never happen in real life, I can feel for the characters, especially Dave and the First Lady, who both try to to the right thing in spite of pressures from other people around them.

This movie reminds me of the book ""Double Star"" by Robert A. Heinlein. In it, the most powerful politician on Mars is kidnapped at exactly the wrong time, when he has an upcoming appointment to join (be adopted into) a Martian family. Nobody else can take his place on this ceremony, and unfortunately, native Martian protocols do not recognize kidnapping as a valid excuse to miss the adoption ceremony.

In ""Dave"" we have a scenario that could not happen, but in ""Double Star"" we see a scenario that would require hiring an actor to pretend to be the politician. In ""Dave"" we have a politician who was crooked, who has the Secret Service hire a double so that he can have a rendezvous with a secretary. In ""Double Star"" we have a politician who is so good a politician that people want to prevent him from making peace with the oldest Martian families. In ""Dave"" we have a pretender who does the right thing in the end, then fakes a stroke to let the Vice President take over. In ""Double Star"" we have a pretender who is forced to assume the role of the beloved politician for the rest of his life because the kidnappers pump the real man so full of drugs that he cannot possibly recover to be himself again.

This movie depicts White House life in a very realistic manner, and Washington ""life"" seems equally realistic, especially when we count all the cameos by actual Washington personages, including U.S. senators, representatives, reporters, and more.

There are comedic elements to this movie, but it is primarily a romantic drama. As the drama unfolds, we see a romance blossoming between the First Lady and the man that she soon discovers is not her husband.

I highly recommend this movie to you.",1455321600,,1986,4.614730878186969

Kevin Kline is glorious as the U.S. President lookalike who substitutes and gets swept away by the sheer enjoyment of playing the role on a grand stage (not just at car dealership openings), then by the satisfaction of accomplishing things with the power he wields. But all the actors (and cameos of real-life politicians, newscasters, etc.) are fun  from Dave's accountant friend Charles Grodin (who drops by the White House to help balance the budget and warns, ""Get out of here as fast as you can!"") to betrayed First Lady Sigourney Weaver (""Why couldn't you die from a stroke like everyone else?"") to White House tour guide Bonnie Hunt (""And we're walking, and we're walking, and we're stopping"").

1346194,5,B00004RYKP,"This is one of a few movies that really gets a emotional response from me. I have often wondered if this country will ever get a president who will truly act in the interests of the people like ""Dave"" does. This is a Cinderfella  story about a man who runs a temp agency being thrust into the role of president because he looks and sounds like him and the powers that be figure they can manipulate him for their own ends. It is also a love story.

I sure most people who aren't part of the power elite will relate to the simple message that this movie presents. Quite simply a man who hasn't been corrupted by the political process comes in sideways to assume the highest office in the land, President of the United States. He proceeds to run the country the way we voters wish it was run instead of being more of the same old stuff.

If you have missed seeing this movie somehow then I recommend you watch it. If nothing else you will be exposed to the idea that maybe the right person still can make a difference in the world.

The last president I felt good about was John F. Kennedy and he wasn't around for long. His brother wasn't around long either.

1346209,4,B00004RYKP,"I'm fully aware that this movie is in no way realistic -- it's a pure fantasy, even if it's technically considered ""realistic fiction.""  Politics is such a messy and delicate game that a scenario like the one presented in this film is pretty much impossible.  But even knowing this, I still enjoy this movie.  It's a feel-good film that shows that good people still exist, even in the political arena, and that one man thrust into unlikely circumstnaces can still accomplish a lot of good.  And the actors make it an enjoyable enough ride that one's able to forget for awhile that they're watching an improbable scenario.

The titular Dave (played by Kevin Kline) is your ordinary everyday American, running a temp agency and living life with plenty of enthusiasm... and he just happens to look just like the President of the United States of America (also Kevin Kline), to the point where he has a side job doing impersonations for public events.  This gets the attention of the Secret Service, who hire Dave as the President's double at a political convention while President Mitchell indulges in an affair with a secretary.  But when the President suffers a debilitating stroke, the corrupt White House Chief of Staff (Frank Langella) convinces Dave to stay on and continue the charade awhile longer, serving as a figurehead while he continues to run the country in secret.  Dave is content to play the role for awhile... but when he realizes he's actually in a position to change the country for the better, he takes the reins and kicks a plan into motion that will (hopefully) better the country, win the heart of the President's bitter wife (Sigourney Weaver), and anger the Chief of Staff enough to plot to get rid of this Presidential doppelgnger...

As I've stated before, the plot is pure fantasy -- ""fantasy"" as in unrealistic, not as in ""wizards and dragons,"" but fantasy all the same.  There are a number of plot holes that the movie doesn't even bother to address, and while it might have been slightly more plausible in 1993, it's definitely improbable in 2015.  Still, the movie remains pleasant and fun to watch throughout, and I found myself immersed enough in its story to overlook the plot holes and just enjoy the ride.  That's the mark of a good movie in my mind -- no movie will ever be totally free of plot holes, so a strong movie will be entertaining and immersive enough to make you overlook the plot holes while you watch.

The strong acting in this film helps it succeed.  Kevin Kline succeeds in being both the jerkish, egotistical President Mitchell and the likable everyman Dave, and seems to be enjoying his role.  His acting is reminiscent of Robin Williams' more laid-back roles -- pleasant and friendly, but not afraid to get goofy when the situation calls for it.  Sigourney Weaver starts off in a role that reminds me of her character from ""Avatar"" -- snarky, cold, and more than a little bitter -- but her character is more complex than just ""witchy woman,"" and she has a softer side that has obviously been beaten down by her marriage but is able to surface again around Dave.  Frank Langella plays an almost cartoonish villain in this film, but he hams it up just enough that you love to hate him but not so much that it breaks your suspension of disbelief.

As a bonus, there are plenty of real-life figures who make cameo appearances throughout the film, including politicians and media figures who were current at the time.  There's even a brief appearance by economist Ben Stein, whom most will probably remember as the stupefying-ly boring teacher in ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off.""

The DVD for the movie is pretty bare-bones, without any extras or behind-the-scenes information.  I don't often watch this bonus material (unless it's deleted scenes), but I know other people appreciate the extras, so if you purchase this DVD, know that all you're getting is the movie.  So I'd wait until it was $5 or less before buying.

A light, feel-good movie, this isn't a cutting-edge political film or anything that will challenge your views on social or political matters.  But it's a well-acted and well-written comedy, and a cut above most other Presidential comedies such as ""Man of the Year"" and ""American Dreamz.""",1431993600,,4253,4.786593707250342

1346213,5,B00004RYKP,"I love the movie. I first saw it when I was 13 going on 14. It was amazing. I had to replace this because I didn't want to watch The American President. This was the first movie where I started to get scared when I see Kevin get hurt or die on screen. Now I only have this as I sold my double feature DVD. Now I'm able to access a behind the scenes featurette. While I was watching that, I was surprised that the White House scenes were built and located in a movie studio because they can't really film the inside of the White House. I also admired Sigourney Weaver from Despereaux. Now I can't wait for the Italian DVD (with French) to come home. Kevin in my opinion is as handsome back in the young adulthood as he is today. I did the same thing to Wild Wild West where I sell the double feature DVD and replace it with only Wild Wild West. Sometimes I can look back to where I met friends and people who went to school with him and how they did not know that he's Phoebus in Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame movies. The role of Dave and Bill were written for Kevin. I'm also surprised that he shared a little screen time with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now I figured out how people in congress thought that Bill died and that was Dave faking the stroke. Then people would bring the real dead body to the ER and Dave dressed up as someone else.

1346221,5,B00004RYKP,"It's a really great feel-good movie! A callous president suffers a stroke and is vegetative. Outside of the scheming chief of staff and one other person, no one else knows. The chief-of-staff puts a nice guy, Dave, who looks like the president, into the role of the president, ostensibly, to keep up appearances for the good of the nation. In reality, however, the chief of staff plans to use Dave as a rube to forward his own ambitions.

The good-hearted Dave believes he is simply acting for the good of the country. In waters deeply over his head (imagine being thrust into a presidential briefing!), Dave is easily manipulated, especially in the early going. Over time, though, Dave starts to realize that no one outside of the chief of staff's innermost circle realizes that anything has changed. To them, he IS the president. Dave sees the scheming chief of staff's manipulations for what they are, and slowly starts exerting some presidential authority on his own. The outraged chief of staff can't stop him or reveal him because that would reveal the chief's own role in the ruse.

Even the first lady, who was emotionally estranged from her president-husband, starts falling in love with Dave. He represents all of the good things that her president-husband had long ago abandoned.

I'd spoil your fun if I told any more at this point! If you need something to help you feel good, you will love this movie!",1428364800,,1415,4.790983606557377

However, Dave is so popular its difficult to keep him in check. Sigourney Weaver is the first lady - and she is just as brilliant as Kevin Kline and everyone else in this drama/comedy. The President bubble must eventually burst, but the story is strong and entertaining and I enjoy it (even though I don't know any of the cameos of real politicians at that time and Kline isn't normally a favourite of mine).",1415491200,,659,4.5
1346289,5,B00004RYKP,"Dave is a political comedy about a man who was asked to stand-in for the President of the United States after the latter suffered a stroke that left him incapacitated. This led to surprising events and results from the administration. This is definitely a charming film that everyone would definitely enjoy. It was Capra-esque as we get to see the theme of an ordinary person fight against a superior evil forces imposed in a system. Added to that,one would definitely enjoy Kevin Kline's performance as it was full of authenticity and charm that one would simply enjoy Dave as a person. Aside from that,the lampooning of the political system was definitely enjoyable and laughable especially for viewers who hate corrupt people in the government.

This story of insider politics and double-dealing in Washington is one of humor and hope. Kevin Klein plays the dual roles of a corrupt President and his innocent look-alike, who is asked to stand in for the real president. What starts out as a one-time commitment becomes one of longer duration -- allowing Klein's naive look-alike to begin examining, exposing, and even correcting the corruption all around him.

Sigourney Weaver is a surprising accomplice as the First Lady. And Frank Langella is exceptionally evil as the President's Chief of Staff. Not to be missed! Pure, wholesome fun.",1412035200,,762,4.765151515151516

The plot is straight forward but the situations/scenes are anything but. The number of stars including the cameo appearances keep this story moving forward. If you like to sit down and watch a good wholesome movie and the idea of the common person winning over the politics of our country, this might be the movie for you. Of course, it would never happen in real life but it is something you might dream about given our current thoughts about our administration and congress.",1405209600,,602,4.742857142857143

After viewing it 3 times it occurred to me yesterday that this is a modern day version of ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"".  The premise being that a decent man not beholding to the wallets who helped bring him to his office can do real good for the people as a whole.  Of course, Dave is not elected to the presidency, but an accident has brought him to this position.  As his confidence grows he begins to use his new found power to help those who have no voice.

He had some interesting ideas that could help turn America's budget around and I wish our current president would take some of his ideas into consideration and get that budget under control.  Spoiler Alert:  At the end, he didn't try to deflect responsibility of the scandal off himself, but made sure the person responsible for the scandal was implicated as well and the vice president was cleared and he was able to return to a normal life.",1396569600,,529,4.921348314606742

1346396,5,B00004RYKP,"I started watching ""Dave"", which is just a great little movie that's about 20 years old (1993) when I saw it on Prime on Friday. I thought, cool, finally Prime's getting some actual decent movies.

Unfortunately I ran out of time and ended up only watching the first half. When I went into my Prime account today to watch the second half, it was gone. Amazon removed it from Prime and now wants money for it.

So a movie that was free on Friday, is now a FEE movie a few days later.

And apparently its that way with all Prime movies now. Anything decent seems to get removed from Prime, and put into the pay category. As I was musing on this I noticed in the ""suggested watching category"" below Dave was ""The American President"", another popular movie that I'd seen in Prime a while back and now also now wanting a fee. Its like they're moving all ""popular"" movies, the movies people actually want to watch, to the Fee based service and taking them out of the Prime membership.

So upon seeing this, I promptly went into my account, and CANCELLED my Prime Membership.  So no, I will NOT be paying the increased rate of $99 dollars to renew my Prime membership next month.

Prime was a good deal at one time, and I supposed if you buy lots of delivered products from them then you can probably make up the 100 bucks on shipping charges. But I bought Prime for all the great free movies. But those offerings have dwindled to a pitiful group of movies, most of which are free elsewhere as well, like Hulu and other similar places. So there's just no way I'm going to pay an increased rate for Prime this year while they're simultaneously decreasing the movies you get to see with it.",1396396800,,1681,4.389067524115756

1346399,5,B00004RYKP,"I have liked this movie since the first time I saw it. A comic rendition of politics and what can happen behind close doors. The almost unbelievable switch of presidents would have conspiracy believers up in arms, but the story line brings a mixture of true politics, the harden and the idealists, comedy among the scenes, and great acting from the participants. I especially appreciate the ending when the writer brought back around that the behaviors, words, and actions of the president is held accountable by the president. As Kevin Kline's presidential character states, ""The buck stops here."" There is a low-lying and subtle reference and connection to the idea that one's character truly does matter.

I recommend it!",1396396800,,724,5.084033613445378

1346424,5,B00004RYKP,"Sometimes you just need a good movie that has a happy ending and makes ya smile. This one is perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, not boring or dead time, it moved well and the cast worked so well together. NO murder, NO bombs or blood and guts. It was heart warming to watch the little guy try to fix a huge wrong. Happen in real life? Never- too much greed and corruption. The movie was still a nice break and could even make ya ponder, what if.....",1395878400,,457,4.204545454545454
1346425,4,B00004RYKP,"Interesting premise, great cast, especially the villans and hero in two roles. Subtle romance angle. Good triumphs over evil. Lots of fun to watch",1395878400,,146,5.125

1346427,4,B00004RYKP,This movie has a kind heart. A regular guy gets to be President for a while. His good intentions get a reality check. Definitely worth watching.,1395878400,,144,4.576923076923077

1346430,4,B00004RYKP,"Funny and entertaining. Dont over analyze it. Get some popcorn, relax and laugh. Very improbable but who cares. Have fun.",1395878400,,121,5.1
1346431,5,B00004RYKP,"This is a feel good movie
Gives you hope that one person
Can make a difference.
I highly recommend it",1395878400,,101,4.1
1346432,5,B00004RYKP,"Funny little comedy about Washington politics. While you would hope that something like this couldn't happen, we will never know. Sometimes over the top, this movie is very enjoyable and worth watching over again.",1395878400,,213,5.294117647058823

1346434,5,B00004RYKP,"I Love this movie more, everytime I see it.  I think it's delightful. Favorite part is when Langella is left standing alone in his living room.",1395705600,,143,4.5
1346435,3,B00004RYKP,"Though, the optimism that politics can spawn good things, even through all the bad, is still a stretch.  IMHO, enjoy!",1395705600,,117,4.85
1346436,4,B00004RYKP,"Liked this movie and the actors. The story is different for sure! Some of the story is 'light', some serious. Something like this would never happen in our country. Totally unbelievable... or is it? :D",1395705600,,201,4.771428571428571

1346439,5,B00004RYKP,"I sure hope the devious men who surround the president as portrayed in this movie are not based on actual advisers in real life.  This movie shows how one man really can make a difference when the motivation is not personal gain.  I highly recommend this movie...I bought it long ago, on VHS!",1395705600,,292,4.490566037735849
1346440,4,B00004RYKP,Very enjoyable movie and one I can (and do) watch over and over.  Excellent story and acting!  So glad it is on Prime!,1395705600,,118,4.086956521739131
1346441,4,B00004RYKP,Very entertaining and fun to watch. A good compromise choice for date night or a mixed crowd. Could easily watch it all over again right after viewing it the first time around.,1395705600,,176,4.53125
1346442,4,B00004RYKP,Getting a president who would work so transparently for the truth would be wonderful. But this level of fantasy is so far outside the realm of reality that aliens and unicorns seem more solidly based. I'm still waiting for the King.,1395705600,,232,4.682926829268292
1346443,5,B00004RYKP,"My favorite! It is a feel-good movie that has 2 great actors in Sigourney Weaver and Kevin Kline, who both shine in this classic movie.",1395705600,,135,4.44
1346444,4,B00004RYKP,We had seen this movie before but we enjoyed the story line so much we wished to watch it again.,1395705600,,96,3.85

1346451,4,B00004RYKP,Has all the elements of a good old fashion romance along with a happy ending. Love that Dave!  Thank you.,1395705600,,105,4.25
1346452,5,B00004RYKP,I love this movie and I've seen it many times.  It's a wish fulfillment movie for liberal Democrats.  Kevin Kline is in top form here and really shines.  Seeing the cameo appearances of so many real political figures is fun also.  Many of them are no longer with us now.,1395619200,,270,4.34
1346453,4,B00004RYKP,"If you like this, I also suggest..""The American President"".  It's a pipe dream, but I wish all politicians remembered what is important.",1395532800,,136,5.181818181818182

1346455,4,B00004RYKP,"Very funny. We enjoyed the film.  I don't particularly like, the promiscuity.  I think all our movies can do better on that.",1395446400,,124,4.590909090909091
1346456,5,B00004RYKP,"Have seen several times before, but brought up on Amazon Prime streaming once more. At the beginning, transition for Kevin Kline from clueless politico  to cynical and critical incumbent president is without makeup, only mannerisms.  As incumbent becomes incapacitated and 'Dave' takes his place, led by a particularly sneering Frank Langella, the gradual shift to a 'kindhearted' president is welcome. This is all supported by cameos of actual politicians and commentators of the day.",1395446400,,485,5.54054054054054
1346457,5,B00004RYKP,A charming romantic comedy (more comedy than romance). Kevin Line is great and Charles Grodin is absolutely brilliant.  All of the casting is perfect - watch for a young Laura Linney and Ving Rhames with hair!,1395446400,,209,4.805555555555555

1346459,5,B00004RYKP,We'll paced and developed story. Good acting and good directing make this a very satisfying comedy. Yikes it is even a very satisfying romantic comedy. From a guys standpoint that is saying a lot.,1395446400,,196,4.794117647058823

1346461,4,B00004RYKP,"I enjoyed this one.  Light comedy treatment of politics and how it effects the presidency.  A crooked president, and his look alike carry this script into wishing that this would somehow happen for real.",1395360000,,203,4.9411764705882355

1346463,5,B00004RYKP,"I have seen it twice and loved it both times, it is preposterous to believe that the plot could ever happen but it is still a great feel good movie where the bad guy gets it in the end.",1395273600,,185,3.769230769230769
1346464,5,B00004RYKP,"I've watched this show several times dating back to when movies were only in VHS tapes. I've followed it through DVD, Blu-Ray and now digital. This show will be remembered as a timeless classic.",1395273600,,194,4.735294117647059
1346465,5,B00004RYKP,I absolutely love this movie. It is truly an inspiration when an ordinary man can become president and actually make a difference.,1395273600,,130,4.954545454545454
1346466,4,B00004RYKP,"Kevin Kline makes his ""Dave"" character come to life.  Sigourney Weaver transforms her First Lady from a stiff caricature of a politician's wife into a warm human being.",1395273600,,168,5.0
1346467,5,B00004RYKP,I've watched this one many times and enjoy it every time I see it. Kevin Kline's a kick in the pants and so good in this.,1395273600,,121,3.6923076923076925

1346471,4,B00004RYKP,"Dave is the man, and the kind of guy every girl should want, and every guy should want to be.  Sigourney is very likeable as well, and a really different, loving role, for her.
Well done....",1395187200,,190,4.277777777777778
1346472,4,B00004RYKP,Great story with a refreshing take on the presidency. Just enough tension to make it a good story while interesting and fairly layed back.,1395187200,,138,4.791666666666667

1346477,5,B00004RYKP,"I've enjoyed this movie for years.  It's just too bad the real politicians can't accomplish as much as Dave did in his brief stint.  Unfortunately, the government functions more the chief of staff in the movie.  Great job by Kevin Kline.",1395100800,,237,4.7317073170731705
1346478,4,B00004RYKP,"Cute movie.  Kevin Kline plays two parts that are both convincing.  I have seen it before, but it was worth seeing again.",1395100800,,121,4.454545454545454

1346484,4,B00004RYKP,This is such a fun movie! The actors did a great job-it was very entertaining and heartwarming to see a story about a President who really cares about the people. It gives me hope that there is just the most wonderful president out there somewhere for the American people!,1395014400,,272,4.571428571428571
1346485,4,B00004RYKP,"Very interesting premise.  The story, although far fetched, made me wonder if doubles are now being used.  Guess we'll never know.  I liked this movie.",1395014400,,151,4.96
1346486,3,B00004RYKP,Dave comes from a different America than the one we live in now. Dare I say a simpler time? 1993 doesn't SEEM so far from us but things have sped up a great deal since then and it's not just in terms of the clunky computers and cell phones you'll see in this film. It's a political fable I guess and I won't waste time going over the synopsis..anyone reading this will already have an idea of the plot. A plot that is gossamer thin really and full of holes BUT it all works because it has heart and charm and a chemistry that brings it all together. Kevin Kline is very good in the title role and harkens back to the days of Jimmy Stewart and Sigourney Weaver works well with him. Ivan Reitman directs and it will repay thoughtful viewing.,1395014400,,739,4.211267605633803
1346487,3,B00004RYKP,"Looking for a light, fast moving entertainment, we hit on ""Dave"" which did not disappoint.  Would certainly recommend it to viewers.",1395014400,,132,5.285714285714286

1346489,4,B00004RYKP,Yet the double sounded a much better candidate the the real thing.. Who knows it could of happened already in our world of today.  The story of the man was too good to be true for the corruption of today. Praise the Lord if we can ever accomplish such a man to run our country.,1394928000,,277,4.036363636363636

1346491,4,B00004RYKP,"Probably not.  It hadn't been invented yet! This flick did explore the corruption in Washington.  However, this movie is sooo behind the times because it's not just the House and Senate,  throw in the FBI, NSA and the IRS.",1394928000,,222,4.641025641025641

1346498,5,B00004RYKP,"I saw this years ago and thought it was really good. After seeing it again I realized how relevant it is to my feeling about government today. The president was a corrupt, cold & void of morals self seeking man. Sound like Obama? Anyway, my favorite part was when  Dave calls a press conference & gets the head of committees to make compromises in order to fund a worthy project.",1394755200,,379,4.414285714285715
1346499,5,B00004RYKP,"It's an original story, part comedy-part drama perfectly suited for Kevin Kline. Kline, employer with a heart of gold, runs a temp agency in small town America, where he is discovered as a possible double for then, President Mitchell, who needs an impersonator to cover his trysts with a White House aide. When Mitchell suffers a heart attack during his liaison, Kline is asked to step in. Sigourney Weaver, who plays President Mitchell's wife, and Kline have wonderful chemistry together and the addition of Charles Grodin, who is one of the most under-rated comedic actors of all time, is outstanding!  I've watched this movie many times since I purchased it several years ago. Every time is a joy!  Supporting characters Frank Langella, Ving Rhames, and Kevin Dunn round out the superb cast!",1394755200,,794,5.007575757575758

1346506,5,B00004RYKP,Funny. This is a great performance by Kevin Kline. Probably one of his best. A comedy about the presidency that has a different spin.,1394668800,,133,4.583333333333333

1346543,5,B00004RYKP,"It's an obtuse premise...but it could happen! You would need either a very strong President who nobody really likes as shown, with a weak V.P., or a President who is a total knucklehead with a V.P. who nobody really knows, or a knucklehead President with a Veep who nobody can figure out, so he is sent roaming the world just to keep him away from The White House...(does the name Dan Quayle strike a familiar note?",1393200000,,415,4.473684210526316

1346545,5,B00004RYKP,"Comedy, romance, and a civic's lesson all in one. Kevin Kline plays Dave, a slightly naive optimistic do-Gooder that operates a temporary employment agency in a small town. Dave impersonates the President for a little extra cash, and ends up with the actual gig after the President falls ill.  The fun is in what happens next, and the charm is that Dave transforms the Presidency with his belief in the ability of government to help people. A modern fable well told.",1392854400,,466,4.753086419753086

1346547,5,B00004RYKP,Kevin Kline plays his part humorously most of the time but does a great job of being serious when required.  And the chief of staff campaign for the presidency is hilarious.,1392595200,,173,4.580645161290323

1346552,5,B00004RYKP,"As we can all readily observe in today's world, governments are all about control of the people, force and violence used against the people, and all of this is as a result of most governments being run by sociopaths.  But in Dave's world, the world of men with a conscience and a set or morals, things are different.  Dave is a good person, and he has a sound belief system that dictates to him that government should work for the people - that government should be the servant to the people.  How provocative is THAT?  Dave's right, of course, and I suspect that only the widespread examination and analysis of how the American federal government actually operates, when compared with how it actually could operate, will result in the changes we all need.

The sterling performances by actors Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley, Charles Grodin, and the rest of the supporting actors and actresses makes telling this story easy - they are all believable.  The good and the bad.

This has become one of my all time favorite movies.  There's not much depth to the vignettes, but the movie helps support and confirm my crazy belief that good people do exist in government, and that given half a chance, they will actually do good for the people for whom they serve.",1391385600,,1312,4.723684210526316

1346556,5,B00004RYKP,"Nice story about a simple guy wanting to help those around him then falls into political powerhouse types who want him to pretend to be President of the U.S. for a while to meet THEIR needs....romantic ramifications with the Presidents wife.

With Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, and Frank Langella (plus a strong supporting cast of players) this movie is excellent. Teaches some good lessons about politics and ethics as well (so well, in fact, that a school teacher acquaintance of mine uses it in his classroom).

1346561,4,B00004RYKP,"It ought to be that easy for a nice guy to get into politics and honestly work to make everything right...maybe it helps when you're both that nice guy and the President of the United States.  It obviously worked for Kevin Kline.  Mr. Kline did a great job giving his two characters distinct personalities and then blending them during his nice guy's time as the President.  Though I will say my favorite in this film was Ving Rhames as the Secret Service agent...I want him protecting me, though I'm not so sure he'd be so willing to take a bullet for me.  Ultimately, Mr. Rhames came off as the nice but tough protector and I think the only thing missing from this film was a scene where he had to stop an assassanation attempt on our beloved hero...though he did stand guard for him at the end (hint, hint.)  I was glad to see that Sigourney Weaver turned into more than just the scorned wife who found a second chance with a new man...her reaction to her husband's motionless body showed that she still cared and that she hadn't truely been ready to face life without him like that.  I wish Ben Kingsley had gotten more screen time as I wanted to see the ""good man"" that his character was rather then just hear about it from everybody else...though I really like his story about how he got into politics.  In the end, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to others.  And, if nothing else, I believe the White House sets in this film were also used in The American President and The West Wing.

1346565,4,B00004RYKP,"Bill Mitchell (Kevin Kline) is the uncaring President of the United States while Dave Kovic (also Kline), who bears an uncanny resemblance to the president, runs a temporary employment agency. When Mitchell wants some private time with a White House aide, the Secret Service tracks down and hires Dave as a stand-in. But when Mitchell suffers from a massive stroke that leaves him incapacitated, White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) decides to keep up the ruse longer than intended. While Alexander concocts a scheme to have himself installed as president, Dave finds he really enjoys his new job. Meanwhile, First Lady Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver) notices her husband's strange new behavior.

I found this movie to be a fun and lighthearted story. Kevin Kline nails his dual-roles. There are also many cameo appearances by real-life politicians and celebrities (such as Tip O'Neill and Jay Leno) that add to the fun. Despite the premise, this movie is not an overly serious satire of American politics nor is it a political drama. Instead, we get an optimistic movie with a happy ending. In some ways, the movie is a product of the times when America was a little more innocent than today (post-Cold War and pre-9/11).

In conclusion, this is a fun movie with good acting.",1390003200,,1299,4.981566820276497

He and Sigourney Weaver, as the First Lady,  have wonderful chemistry together. And Frank Lanagella is such a deliciously evil bad guy, he practically steals the show.

1346669,5,B00004RYKP,"My husband and I were looking for a movie to watch when we came across this one. The story is about Dave who impersonates the President of the United States at various venues. The real president uses impersonators to give himself free time and always has his special staff looking for men to use. They see Dave's performance at a car dealership. He is hired to walk to the car waving to the people after the real president's speech. Trouble ensues when the president has a stroke and Dave is brought back to pretend to be the president. He thinks he will be pseudo president until the real president recovers. The truth is that the stroke was massive and the president will not get better.

Despite the serious storyline, this is an uplifting, humorous movie that I enjoyed watching. Dave is a likeable guy. He helps others. He has a wonderful sense of humor. Most important, he does the right thing even when it is hard. He is true to the morals he lives his life by. This is a movie that makes you feel good.

1346708,4,B00004RYKP,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Most people would skip movies like that because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". Unfortunately, Dave is not a ""clean"" movie.  I actually watch it with a ClearPlay filter.

Early in the movie, there is a sex scene between the President and his secretary (no frontal nudity is shown, only bare shoulders and legs).  Later in the movie, the First Lady walks in on Dave in the shower. He is shown fully naked from behind through the shower glass. When he turns around to speak to her, the First Lady glances downward but no flesh is shown.  Near the end of the movie, a man and a woman are shown kissing passionately for several seconds.

Two scenes in the movie depict a man having a stroke and being rushed to the hospital. There are minor curse words used throughout the movie and in several scenes, characters are drinking beer or wine for dinner and cocktails. There is no drunken/lewd behavior, violence/gore, drugs, or smoking scenes in this movie.

The movie is about Dave, a temp agency owner, who is put in as a temporary stand-in for the U.S. President, but is convinced by the White House Chief of Staff, that he has a duty to take the job more permanently when the President has a stroke and goes into a coma.  The Chief of Staff has an agenda of his own: to hide the Presidents condition, pin some scandal (that he and the real President are actually responsible for) on the Vice President, so when the ""President"" has another stroke, this time more serious, he can name his Chief of Staff as the acting president.  However, Dave starts to get his own ideas about how things should be run.  Since the President was hired to do a job, and a temp job at that, he should care more about others than he does about himself. So, with the help of the head Secret Service agent and the first lady, Dave tries to turn things around.

Overall, I like the movie.  It has a lot of redeeming and funny parts, but I would not watch it without some kind of filter.",1380067200,,2150,4.376884422110553

1346736,5,B00004RYKP,"This is a highly amusing and very well-acted film about the shenanigans one can find inside the White House at any given time.  Is the man speaking really your President, or is it an imposter, a look-alike, filling in while your real fellow is in a coma?  Will any of us really know who or what our Presidents are, let alone if they are fakes?

This gem by the director of GHOSTBUSTERS shows a time in Washington awash in the euphoria of the post-Cold War, when our system and our Reagan adminstration, not to mention the internal conflicts of Communism, brought down Russia and the East Bloc nations.  Our military budgets were suddenly flush, our computer advances had made our country rich, the real estate prices were skyrocketing, and Clinton (even his wife, Hilary) looked good. That he was a glutton with little regard for anyone but himself - this was considered laughable, probably predictable, culminating in the low-down act of wannabe fornication with a Jewish female house aide, Lewinski.  Without shame, our President was on the prowl - as were many before him, especially Johnson and Kennedy, for the gullible females.  We're even shown the dark and slimy tunnel through which Johnson used to escape:  Dave uses it, too.

In any case, this film is an enjoyable romp through the front and back corridors of power as our real President lays in a coma after a double stroke.  Actor Kevin Kline plays brilliantly a temp-office owner who's a dead ringer for the man in the White House, Bill Mitchell.  He gradually comes to truly enjoy his new role, rather rapidly gets beyond the waving and handshaking role, and is soon addressing his aides and experts personally, all in bluff.  He banks on his puppetmasters not willing to admit this charade, and takes advantage of speaking his mind on issues to do with homeless children and unemployment.  His audience is astounded at his change of heart, attributing it to his short and quick brush with death.  The nation and its TV commentators are singing his praises, for he seems to be a new man full of hope and change and energy.

The audience, we happy citizens and taxpayers, sit and enjoy this charade at home or in a theater.  If it were true in reality, perhaps we would be upset for a moment or two, but upon quick reflection, we would shrug and admit, ""What difference does it make? They're all crooks.""  It turns out the real President Mitchell is indeed a crook in misappropriating funds along with his top advisors.  Our temporary step-in soon catches on to the hanky-panky and decides to address these millions stolen directly before a joint hearing of Congress and in impromptu White House press releases.  His real fellow's wife suddenly takes an interest in him, when in the real life, she despises her now almost-dead husband, his philandering, his ""misappropriations"", his callous indifference to the suffering of homeless and poor Americans.  She has become burnt out, angry and disgusted.  She awakens happily to the reality that a ""new man"" is in charge although he's a dead ringer for her real hubbie.

Since most of us are burnt out about our government, due to exposure to our own and foreign crime shows and horror films generally, not to mention big fat history books available to all in public libraries, this film hits the funny bone of those still not too cynical to laugh.  I really enjoyed seeing the quick guest appearances of Tip O'Neill, Jay Leno and Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with many other Washington insiders, who were apparently happy to show up and play a part in this send-up of our US government and its shenanigans.

IN the end, there's an attempt to make this film a ""Happy End"" film (as the Germans would call the genre), for our temp office owner does return to his true identity and tries to run for Alderman (or Councilman or Supervisor) as a starting point to get into politics, because he ""cares about helping people"".  That he misappropriated $650 million for his ""jobs"" program is irrelevant.  He CARES and we are supposed to be HAPPY that he CARES about the lack of jobs and the ensuring poverty.  Never mind that it has to be stolen from normal people in the first place in order to happen at all.  Hey, all you happy workers, keep on working and paying your taxes?

The ex-first wife (with now truly dead husband, therefore a widow) comes looking for him and they have a deep kiss.  All is well!  Let them eat cake!  (i.e. your eggs, flour, butter and sugar...)

What a story.

But in the end, it's entertaining and well-done, and the older this film gets, the more you may enjoy its nostalgic feeling, the time before we all started worrying about TERRORISTS, not our own in-house thieves.

Clinton, we salute your resolution to abstain from donuts,as Dave demonstrates with Schwarzenegger and kids!!!",1376611200,,4816,4.755716004813478
1346737,5,B00004RYKP,I was so happy to get this movie on DVD as I have loved this movie since it came out in the 70s. Kevin Kline's portrayal as an Average Joe who is suddenly thrust into the political limelight is a fun way to spend a movie night.,1376438400,,227,3.851063829787234

1346749,3,B00004RYKP,"I remembered liking this movie the first time I saw it, years ago, so I recently recommended it to a friend and we watched it.  It wasn't quite as good this time around.  Maybe because the worldview (and resulting political platform) of the president in the film annoyed me at times.  But if you can get past the simplistic view of politics and mistaken view of the role of state government, it's a cute film.  Cute premise.  Some sexual content at the beginning can be easily skipped, and some mild sexual content later in the film.",1375142400,,533,4.510416666666667

1346758,5,B00004RYKP,This is a great satire on politics in Washington and even features many of the key political players from the period. Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver are wonderful and I can't get enough of the understated but solid Ving Rhames as the Secret Service agent. Frank Langella plays a cross between Dick Cheney and Dracula. This film makes Washington look like a puppet show!,1373414400,,371,4.8125
1346759,3,B00004RYKP,"Let's not sugarcoat this too much.  `Dave' is a really stupid movie.  I mean, it would never and could never happen and at the end of the day the actions of many in the film are headscratching in their preposterousness and yet, to be honest, it all kind of works thanks to the presentation.  From Kevin Kline's touching performance to Sigourney Weaver's biting sarcasm and felt honest to Frank Langella's embrace of pure evil, `Dave' offers up a lot of clich&eacute;s and stereotypes and yet we accept it gladly.  Sure, I would have loved a little more thought to have gone into the plot.  We never really understand what Bob Alexander's evil machinations are all about and the surface attempt at giving Dave a `purpose' or a `cause' felt tacked on and underdeveloped.  Still, Weaver is a dream from the minute she walks on the screen (""why can't you die from a stroke like everyone else?"") and Kevin Dunn drips charm behind his beard.  Kline is an actor I just kind of love to see in movies, and this was no exception.  He just `gets' it.  Seeing Linney, Kingsley and Rhames looking so young was fun, and at the end of the day this kind of mediocrity can be entertaining in the right doses.  This isn't a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but sometimes `good' is all you need.",1373328000,,1290,4.521551724137931

1346762,4,B00004RYKP,"What would you do if you became President of the United States overnight?  Dave Kovic (Kevin Kline) is a likeable guy who runs a temp agency.  He also bears an uncanny resemblance to the President.  One day, some Secret Service agents show up at his house, recruiting him to act as a double.  Dave agrees, but then gets more than he bargained for.

This is a fun, good-hearted movie.  Kline is endearing as the underdog who suddenly becomes the Commander and Chief.  The supporting cast is also strong, with good performances from Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley and especially Charles Grodin in limited screen time.  This comedy manages to steer clear of potty humor and the like that is so common in films today, and instead explores the subject with an almost childlike innocence.

Parental Advisory: Dave is rated PG-13.  It does contain one adulterous sex scene that is heard more than seen (there is no nudity).  There is another scene where a man is seen showering through fogged glass.  His buttocks are visible briefly, but that's all.  There is some mild profanity at points and a couple abuses of God's name.  Other than these bits, it is a relatively tame movie.

The quality of the Blu-ray transfer is quite good.  Details are sharp, and colors are strong.  The sound is a little bit soft, however--I had to crank it on my system.  The weird thing was that it would not go any higher than a certain point.  It sounded no louder at 60 than it did at 30.  When there was no background noise, it was okay.  But when my wife started doing some stuff in the kitchen, it made it difficult to hear the dialogue at times.  Nevertheless, I was still pleased with this Blu-ray.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.

Dave is a light, heart-warming comedy.  It is a good antidote to some of the crass, hit you over the head comedies that are being made these days.  I highly recommend it.",1372896000,,1941,4.569767441860465
1346763,5,B00004RYKP,"Although this movie is now about 20 years old, before the internet & twitter (really before cell phones although some people had those big box things back then), it still seems uncannily current and relevant.  And although the story begs your suspension of some reality, in the end it's a heartwarming story and the acting's top notch. This movie reminded me so much of Frank Capra movies, ie. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and indeed I believe his son is one of the producers of this movie.",1372723200,,491,4.64367816091954

Even though the only way to do it is hire the unemployed, and give them make-work positions, this will be the legacy of an otherwise sleazy President before he turns the office over to a successor. Kevin Kline plays the part of the elected Commander in Chief, as well as a proprietor of an employment office (get the connection???). Sigourney Weaver is first lady who hates the 'pit vipers' who work for her husband and refuses to act out a role.
The contrast between the two men only seems to highlight the difference between those who have no ethics but reach for high office, and those with ethics who 'want to change things for better' and run for local offices.
Oh, there is a funny piece where Charles Grodin tries to balance the Federal budget.... Next Cabinet meeting, Dave uses some budget reallocations to achieve a social goal.",1370649600,,897,4.756410256410256

I think that it has a nice feel to it but is still able to convey the need for change in the US government.  So many of the political message movies today have such a hard exterior that, while they are great movies, stress you out a little.  This movie has the perfect balance of comedy and light-heartedness all while still conveying the obvious need for change in government.  It's a movie about political corruption that really doesn't focus too much on the corruption.  Obviously one could easily get caught up in the impossibility that is the premise, but if you can get beyond that it really is a nice, easy movie with a good message that reverberates today as much or more than it did when this movie was made.

In order to help her with one of her projects for the homeless, Kevin enlists the aid of Murray Blum,his friend and accountant played to perfection by Charles Grodin. Kevin asks him to help him trim a large sum of federal money in order to help the real president's wife, Sigourney Weaver, keep her favorite homeless project afloat. Makes it all look so easy in light of Washington, D.C.'s hopeless habit of overspending  and running up huge deficits. So, I ask: where are Kevin Kline (and Charlie Grodin ) when we need them?  Fun movie for some light hearted entertainment. I highly recommend it!",1366761600,,734,4.817460317460317

1346868,3,B00004RYKP,"First copy of this that we received when it was opened had some very noticeable fingerprints on one side (it is a double-sided disc) and a few scratches on the other side.  Made me wonder if it was a used copy.  At the very least there was some poor handling going on in packaging the DVD.  Then when we tried to play the disc, the subtitles came on and couldn't be turned off via the menu.  This was true for both versions on both sides of the disc.  The other issue is one side was supposed to be the full-screen version and the other side a wide-screen version.  I couldn't tell the difference as both sides appeared to be the full screen version.  Perhaps this may have been due to the age of the movie.  These issues were apparent on multiple players and on the DVD player on our PC.

Fortunately, Amazon was great about our returning the original copy of the movie after the normal return period, but the subtitles still came on by default on both sides of the disc on the replacement copy, but this time we were able to turn them off via the menu.  Still couldn't tell the differences between the so-called full screen version and wide screen version on the replacement copy.",1363219200,,1182,4.3807339449541285

1346875,5,B00004RYKP,"I love this movie Ive probably seen it 100 times. all on TV or ones I might have recorded myself. It is enchanting with the glowing romance between ""Dave"" and Segurney Weaver' Character.  also the idea of finding a ""Dave"" is very appealing. Who has not looked into a room full of people and wondered.  ""Is she/he my double? Maybe a long a long lost sibling?"" It almost fits in the ""fantasy"" than a ""comedy"". A lot of talking points are addressed and handled in a light-- hearted casual manner the is similar but lighter version of ""The West Wing"" . I finally bought this movie from Amazon. it  was on sale and I picked it from their very long list. It came two days after I ordered it. the disc is in good shape with no visible damage. If the recent election has you off the deep end with negativity try this dvd. I now know I can watch this disc without worring  that it will be phased out.",1360108800,,891,4.223529411764706

President Bill Mitchell (also Kevin Kline) is taken seriously ill when he suffers a stroke during an extra-marital liason with Randi (Laura Linney). A stand-in is urgently needed to fulfil the President's duties until he hopefully recovers. Just by chance, Secret Service Agent Duane Stevensen (Ving Rhames) happens on Dave Kovic, manager of an employment agency, who is a complete ringer for the President. Dave is coached into the part because the White House power-brokers know that they cannot mold Vice-President Gary Nance (Ben Kingsley) to do their bidding. But once `in office' Dave has ideas of his own about helping the disadvantaged and unemployed. The President's wife, Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver), leads an essentially separate life to the President but also is highly motivated with a social conscience. She is therefore surprised and delighted when her new `husband' starts supporting her in her social causes. President Mitchell eventually dies, Nance takes over, and Ellen is out of a job or home.

Former Speaker Tip O'Neil, Alan Simpson ( famous now for Simpson Bowles Debt Commission), Former Senator Chris Doss now running MPAA, and William Pitts, a long time parliamentary master House staffer who set up the House of Representaives scene and spoke the classic ""Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.""
Of course there is Kevin Klein, Ben Kingsley, S. Weaver, Ving Rhimes early great role as a secret service agent, and Charles Grodin as an outside accountant brought in to analyze the President's budget-an unforgettable scene.
It's all there inside Washington, particularly greed for power. I don't want to ruin the plot, but this is by far the best story of Washington, with biting truth  in an enjoyable comedic overlay.
Look for the insiders and others playing roles...guess who was the former judge in John Water's film, Cry Baby, or Ivan Reitman's son, now an Oscar winning director in his own right, with Juno, and others!

When the Secret Service recruits Dave to front for the President after a political speech, and the President unexpectedly becomes incapacitated, the unscrupulous White House Chief of Staff maneuvers Dave into continuing to pose as the President.  Dave, thinking he is helping the situation agrees, and soon finds himself in a mess.  He is alone, flanked by people bent on pulling his strings for their own purposes.  Even the first lady (Weaver) hates her husband, so Dave has no allies.  Then it strikes Dave that maybe, just maybe, he will be able to do some good and help some people.  Then his plan hits the fan when the Chief of Staff think that Dave is crossing him.

This is a wonderful story, and Kline and Weaver pull off their parts flawlessly.  This romantic comedy of political maneuvering and side-stepping while trying to do the right thing is sure to warm your heart.

We watched it since it is election time, and we are hoping that good people, like Dave, will actually be elected.

A strong cast and a heart warming story provide entertainment value throughout this movie, and Kevin Kline's dual role as the corrupt President and the struggling employment agency owner is another in the long list of examples of his versatility.

""Dave"" makes you wish that a dose of common sense could actually enter into the picture in our federal government, but of course that element of the film makes it the biggest fantasy effort of all time. LOL

1346936,5,B00004RYKP,"Dave, 1993 film

The film begins at the White House. A helicopter lands on the lawn, the President returns home. A double will be required to substitute for the President. Dave Kovick is offered a chance to help the Government. The President inspects him, and approves: don't smile! The President is on a Top Secret Mission! But a stroke happens. Can this be kept secret? Dave will impersonate the President full-time. Can the Vice-President be replaced? ""He's OK."" The President is recovering. Dave picks up the mannerisms. Can he convince the First Lady? ""Yes!"" Dave plays the part well. Was he transformed? Real people appear as themselves. The President and First Lady visit a Homeless Shelter for Children. Is this a change in personality?

The Presidential Veto affects Homeless Shelters. Murray visits to work on the budget. Can they rearrange the budget? Tough choices? Ellen suspects something. A secret passage leads to the lawn. They are pulled over in the street. ""Save your money."" Dave likes helping people [it requires power]. Will there be a conflict with Bob Alexander? Bill Mitchell has new proposals. Oliver Stone suspects changes in the President from the before and after photographs. [More humor?] Bob Alexander makes charges against Bill Mitchell. VP Nance is a good man. He started out selling shoes. There is a Joint Session, the President speaks about the First Liberty Bank scandal. There is a dramatic event! [This allows the end of the impersonation.] The President is rushed to the hospital, can he be saved? Did they switch bodies on the way to Bethesda Hospital? The nation goes into mourning. Gary Nance is now President.

This comedy satire is funny in spots, and dramatic overall. It presents an insider's view to White House politics. Students of history will see the references. Do Bob and Alan remind you of Haldeman and Erlichman? Does VP Nance look like Ross Perot with a background like Truman? Does the coolness between Bill and Ellen resemble that of another Presidential couple? Years ago I read a book by a Secret Service Agent who resembled FDR and doubled for him at times. While rulers have used doubles for centuries there is no mention about the President's doubles (if he has any). Was this inspired by true events? The experienced doctors at Dallas said JFK was shot from the front. The body in Bethesda had a shot from the rear. This could have been done with the sacrifice of a Presidential double. Was that the hidden message in this comedy? Or just a wild idea from an Oliver Stone impersonator?",1272758400,,2551,4.900462962962963

1346950,3,B00004RYKP,"I do agree that this film is funny.  I also agree that it provides the audience an insider's view of the world that is United States Presidency.

 What worries me, however, is the question of what sort of individual should the President of the United States be?  For that matter I extend this question to include any leader of a nation.  In this film the ""real"" President is a mean distant prick.  While Dave is a warm and open person who is concerned about the wellbeing of all Americans.  I certainly agree these characteristics are not only highly desired in a leader, but even required.  There is the issue that character Dave is a common man with no experience in politics whatsoever  This lack of experience would impair his ability to perform the tasks involved in being the President.  Not only that is that we have no idea of the character's background, specifically  the level and quality of education.

 It is clear that the makers of this film want to express an anti-elitist view on what sort of people should occupy political office, especially the presidency.

 This film was made in 1993, however in the context of recent history the subject is certainly very relevant today.  Does American society truly want a common man as President. Regardless of whether the people actually do, or not, I contend that they should not.  The job is extremely difficult one which requires very talented individuals with ideas that are well thought out, but also the image of the President must impress the international community.

 Can a person with only a mediocre education and a minimum of experience realistically meet the the same level of competency as as someone who has the very best background which includes graduating from the best schools i.e. Harvard, Yale and Princeton and significant experience in public office.

 Elitism in the media has recently been made to appear in a negative light.  To this I say do not the  people deserve the very best people with finest minds to lead rather someone who does not possess these qualities.

  The character of Dave is not the only example of character that is used to demonstrate the the film maker's argument.  The person who was the Vice President was originally a shoe salesman before running for office.  ha ha ha.  That is not even remotely realistic.  It may seem seem like a positive thing to other viewers of the film that a member of the executive would have such a background in order for him not to be an elitist, however, I ask the viewers to reconsider in the events of recent history.  Not to get to political but those who are against elitism in politics, specifically the Republicans should keep in mind that their past VP was a former CEO of Halliburton.  While this is an extremely distasteful corporate background to myself and and no doubt many others find it to be it still does prove a point.  No one who has been mayor of small town Wasilla, Alaska  which only has a population of 5,469 people and serves as Governor of Alaska for barely three years will ever be elected to the Executive.  Now, honestly, Is that not a good thing.",1266192000,,3113,4.680811808118081

The movie is both funny and serious, as it portrays the misadventures of Dave as he is kidnapped by the Secret Service to take the place of the actual president, who has been stricken with a stroke.

Does politics intrude on the movie?  Yes, if you're looking for it.  Dave is, after all, portrayed as kind of a bleeding heart liberal, but in the nicest possible way:  he genuinely cares about people; there doesn't appear to be a scheming, back-stabbing bone in his body.

While Dave, the movie, was released 16 years ago, it still rings true and will be, and should be, considered a classic movie about what is good about America and Americans.",1252713600,,884,4.776315789473684

I haven't seen this movie for 10 or 12 years so it was almost like new to me. Dave is a likeable, naive, everyman with an uncanny resembalance to the president. He has used it to make extra money & the White House had used him that very fateful night. The president is a rather mean sprited crook. He also cheats on his wife. While in bed with a young, female aide, he has a massive stroke. He is not going to survive. Instead of calling the vice-president, the president's Chief of Staff, a deliously evil, Frank Langella, calls on Dave to sit in as the president while he puts a rather complex plan into operation to seize the presidency for himself. He figures he can handle Dave & control the government from behind the scenes until his plan can go into effect. Time passes & President Mitchell still persists in a brain-dead coma. Dave starts to realize how criminally Langella has acted & starts exerting some authority. Meanwhile, he starts getting friendly with the first lady, Ellen (Sigourney Waever) who had been estranged from & ignored by the president. She knows about his affairs & soon figures out Dave is not the president. But he is interested in her pet project, helping homeless orphans which the president had rejected. So she doesn't blow the whistle & they begin to fall in love. When Dave becomes fully aware of Langella's criminality he fires him & the now ex-Chief of Staff plots revenge. The whole mess gets straightened out in the end. This movie puts me in mind of several movies that followed such as American President & Wag the Dog. My two favorite scenes were the first lady confronting Dave while he's in the shower. The scene of Langella, alone in the oval office softly humming 'Hail to the Chief' while he gleefully forges the president signature on various bills is priceless. Glossed over of course, is the fact that Dave & the first lady have themselves committed some serious crimes. But that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of this movie.

But when you cast Kevin Kline as both characters you have the makings of a terrific film.  Kline is so good that we suspend our disbelief and willingly follow him through this madcap scenario.  Sigourney Weaver is excellent as the first lady whose starch begins to melt under the warmth of the fake president,  Frank Langella is terrific as the evil brains behind the throne, Ving Rhames embues what could be a stock character with real warmth, Charles Grodin is always wonderfully funny, and Ben Kingsley is his usual sterling self.  Who have I left out?  Laura Linney has a small part but she always shines.  I guess Kevin Dunn plays the other bad guy and he's good too.

I found the first half, which is funnier, much more entertaining than the second part when the fake President (Dave) starts to take his job seriously and tries to implement real change.  That's where the plausibility gap got too big for me and a lot of shmaltzy stuff turned me off a bit (the fight to save the homeless shelter).  However by that time I was hooked by Kline/Dave and hung in there to see how the film makers were going to wind the thing up.

I kept thinking of how this could have been a real bomb (in the bad sense) with lesser actors---like Jim Carrey as Dave.  Kline takes what could have been a silly role and makes it something wonderful.  It's a film worth seeing.",1234051200,,1465,4.441947565543071

However, when Dave starts to see the advisors' cynical politicking for what it is, he becomes determined to follow his own conscience and try to use his position to help people.

Kevin Kline plays two parts in the movie, Dave and President Bill Mitchell. Dave operates a temp agency and also makes a few extra bucks playing President Bill Mitchell.

The night Mitchell is to give an important speech Dave is used as a decoy so that the real President can make it to the speech without the press hounding him. After the speech though the President meets up with one of his aids and while having sex has a massive stroke.

The Presidents advisers do not want the American people to know because they don't like Vice President Nance. They convince Dave to pretend to be Dave for a few months, which at first he does not want to do. They convince him though and for a while it works.

One wrench in the plan is Bill Mitchell's wife Ellen. At first she does not suspect anything is amiss, but soon figures out that Dave is not her husband. The reason for this is that Bill and Ellen do not have a great relationship (because she knows about his cheating), but Dave looks at her leg one day in the limo.

During Dave's time as President he learns a few things about life and politics and with the help of Ellen works out a plan to get out of the Oval office.

1346994,4,B00004RYKP,"Dave Kovic (Kevin Kline) is the owner of a small temporary placement agency who moonlights as a presidential impersonator. Through a series of unlikely events, he ends up masquerading as the President after the genuine article has a massive stroke. His Chief of Staff (Frank Langela) uses him as a puppet, he inherits a first lady (Sigourney Weaver) who hates his guts, and it's all he can do to remember the names of his major advisors. As the story progresses, Dave struggles to keep the lie from being discovered while doing good for America.

Like virtually any comedy, and especially these wish fulfillment types, Dave is not a movie whose plot would be called realistic. It's escapist entertainment, though it certainly has a message it wants to tell. Dave Kovic gets represents each of us in a way no elected President ever would, because he really is just an ordinary guy. His decency is touching and the movie does a good job of hammering home the theme that elected officials are there to serve the people, and not the other way around.

One odd thing about this film is that it doesn't have many laughs for a comedy. It isn't that a lot of humor falls flat, the truth is that there aren't too many places where they really went for major laughs. This is more of a relaxed remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Smith-Goes-to-Washington/dp/B00003L9CJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</a>&nbsp;than it is a true comedy.

This is an enjoyable movie, but its message is undercut by an apparent partisan blindness of the creators. Dave starts to leave the White House because he realizes that it's wrong to carry on the charade. Then he decides it's okay as long as he uses the power for causes he thinks are noble. Ouch. Dave and the Chief of Staff both try to take control illegally and both are equally wrong. The Vice President was elected by the people to serve if something happened to the President and Dave should have turned things over to him because it was the right thing to do, not because of a scandal. The filmmakers missed a golden opportunity to show that the means don't justify the ends and were apparently unaware that they sent the opposite message instead.

Dave is an entertaining movie, and its heart is mostly in the right place. It certainly isn't a movie that will make you laugh until you cry, but it does have an easygoing sweetness that makes it easy to watch. It doesn't break Hollywood's pattern of vilifying conservatives, but it's not as abusive as most movies. The performances are all very well done and the story moves along smartly. I would recommend it to almost anyone who can watch without taking any of it seriously.",1200009600,,2736,4.890086206896552

1346996,5,B00004RYKP,"I've been interested in this movie since it came out, and finally watched it.  It was better than I expected.  My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  There is one scene, one of just a handful that added the -13 to the PG rating, that we had qualms about, but even that scene had a key place in the story.

I love movies about ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances and rise above them.  This is an example of such a movie, and it is great.  The cast is fantastic.  And it saves one funny scene for the end.

One other good thing about this movie -- it uses real life politicians and political analysts.  The one draw back, which is normal (unfortunately) for Hollywood, is that the Democrats all side with the hero, while the Republicans are more skeptical.  I wish that every pro-Democrat movie would be matched with a pro-Republican movie, but it would take three years of every movie being pro-Republican to accomplish that (at least).

I highly recommend this movie, and if you don't believe me, note how many 2 and 1 star reviews this movie received.  At this point, it's zero combined.  Only seven three star reviews.  There are more than four times as many four star reviews than three star, and the four star and three star (and for that matter the one and two star) reviews combined are less than the five stars.",1195776000,,1361,4.524590163934426

1347001,5,B00004RYKP,"""Dave"" was a pleasant enough movie the first time I saw it, in 1993, with the good guys winning, and with superb acting performances by Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Ben Kingsley, and particularly Ving Rhames and Kevin Dunn in supporting roles. In a very small role, Charles Grodin does his best work that I've seen him do, and has one of the outstanding lines: ""Who DOES these books?"" Langella is quite believable as the astute, scheming politico who has never been bested; Dunn develops his character's moral conscience as we watch him on screen; and Rhames balances perfectly his character's initial distrust of the faux-president with his growing admiration of--and loyalty to--the kind of integrity so many of us wish we could find in ""the leader of the free world.""

When I decided to see it a second time, I viewed it as a movie or literary critic would, and found that it held together structurally, it developed organically, and it balanced some pretty heavy duty themes with good humor and almost-perfect timing. We have nearly worn out the original VHS tape that we bought, watching it whenever we want a ""feel-good"" movie, especially after seeing or reading about too much national and international news. Each time I watch it, I see more complexity to the character development and to the plot intricacies (which at first seem to be pretty straight-forward but, upon reflection, are not quite so simple).

""Dave"" grows on its audience, appealing initially because it does represent what so many Americans would really like our government to be like; but it invites repeated viewing because of its texture, its acting, and so many of its memorable lines.  How often, for example, can you imagine laughing at, ""I once caught a fish THIIIIIISSSS big!"" In the context of this movie, however, it is funny repeatedly while contributing seriously to character development. And how touching is the simple statement near the end of the movie, ""I woulda taken a bullet for you,"" spoken quietly though in turbulent surroundings.

Even the ending, sappy though it may seem to be, holds open a subtle promise for the future when it is viewed in the light of the early political career of the movie's Vice President. ""Dave"" has risen steadily to become one of my five or six favorite movies, with ""8 1/2,""  ""Inherit the Wind,"" ""Rear Window,"" ""Tootsie,"" and ""Blazing Saddles.""  I heartily recommend it: for a good time, call ""Dave."" Really.",1179014400,,2455,4.932203389830509

A very well written screenplay and a surprise that Hollywood would turn out something so wonderful given their usual depictions of politics in general. This is without a doubt my favorite film dealing with a political topic. The character of ""DAVE"" is so real and perfect for the oval office. He manages to turn around a corrupt government, balance the budget using down to earth every day person tactics and unites the country during his short term in office, as an imposter. He exposes those in high places who are trying to turn things to their own advantage, and brings a forgotten, unpopular Vice President to the fore front, to take the helm at a very crucial time for America. Many of us have often thought that the Presidency should be given to someone who is just a normal, every day American, without the wealth and prestige that is almost always associated with it. ""DAVE"" gives us that chance, if only fantasy. You will be surprised by every turn of this adventure. It is hilarious, dramatic, romantic and fun to watch.

Kevin Kline plays Dave, an affable temp agency owner who on his off-time likes to do small event impersonations of the President.  As for his luck, he strikes an uncanny resemblance, a la the Prince and the Pauper, and is found by the Secret Service to be an ideal candidate for a decoy body while the President is off doing...  confidential things.

However, when the real President has a stroke, his advisors don't want to set off a national emergency... especially with a liberal vice-president around to think about.  Thus they move Dave in a la The Hudsucker Proxy as the new President... but of course, Dave has a warm heart and an inspiration to try his hardest at everything he does, so...  he goes at his job with the energy, charisma, and skill that everyone wants from the most powerful man in the world, even warming the angry scowl off of Susan Sarandon's face!

Of course like most cathartic entertainment like this, it's not so much about the actual presenting of ideas on how to solve all the problems (some hints on where to start are made), but more a vehicle for opening up the minds of the audience to the possibility of TRYING to make the world a better place.  You can't get answers from it, but dreams, so dream hard.  Don't worry, Ving Rhames will grow to like you.

The true entertainment from this comes from Kline.  His acting is wonderfully physical and involved, and bleeds a sincerity to the common man, the salt of the Earth, that keeps the audience cheering for him the entire way.

The political vision of that film holds that the causes of violence, war and corruption in the world are basically some corrupt politicians, the mob, and spineless world leaders.  Likewise, this movie reduces the political powers that constrain a president's autonomy to a couple of white house handlers.  For example, President Dave initiates a bill that will give a job to every person who wants one, and which his successor pushes through Congress.  Absent are the military-industrial complex and the multinational corporations who hold most of the real political power in the world, and who would certainly have some objections to a full employment bill.

1347019,4,B00004RYKP,"One of the more charming romantic comedies of the 1990s, Dave is a Washington insider's dream - a dead president, behind the scenes power struggles, conspiracies, and lots of cameos by famous Washington politicians. Playing the title role, Kevin Kline comes across as an extremely likeable character, and Sigourney Weaver turns in one of the best performances of her career. In short, Dave is about the American Dream - the dream that anyone can grow up to be President of the United States. It's just that most people dream of taking a different route to the highest office in the land...

Dave Kovic (Kevin Kline) is a normal American, living out the American Dream by running his own business - an employment agency. A charismatic and loved figure in his own community, Dave also happens to be a spitting image of the President of the United States. Around town, he's famous for his brilliant impressions of the president, and people take notice. In fact, the Secret Service also takes notice...

One day, several Secret Service agents approach Dave in regard to acting as a double for the president. He agrees, and they hurry him off to a hotel where he's supposed to leave through the front entrance while the president sneaks out the back. But when the president suffers a stroke while having an affair with his secretary, Dave is retained by White House Chief Of Staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) and White House Communications Director Alan Reed (Kevin Dunn). The two men want Dave to fill in for the president while he recovers from his stroke, so as not to worry the general public.

Convincing the nation is easy for Dave, but convincing First Lady Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver), even though her relationship with the president soured long ago, proves to be a far more formidable task. With Alexander running the show as de facto president - telling Dave what to do, what to say, and how to act - Dave decides to strike out on his own and start introducing legislation. Angered, Alexander his cohorts devise a scheme which will implicate Vice President Gary Nance (Ben Kingsley), an honest man, for past crimes committed by President Mitchell. Meanwhile, Alexander plans to have himself appointed Vice President after President Mitchell's stroke is announced to the public. The nefarious scheme would make Alexander the new president, but Dave has other ideas in mind. Teaming up with the first lady, he devises a plan of his own to foil the evil Bob Alexander...

Like its contemporary, The American President, Dave doesn't take itself too seriously. Despite the absurd proposal of a guaranteed job for everyone (why not pass a bill that guarantees peace on earth?), the film doesn't pick a side between Republicans or Democrats. But more importantly, this film is funny. It's witty and entertaining. Dave isn't a film that was ever in danger of sweeping the Academy Awards (although it was nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar), but instead it's a film that's just to be enjoyed. And it is enjoyable - that's why Dave ranks as a definite must-see film...

The DVD Report",1113868800,,3091,4.88
1347020,4,B00004RYKP,"I presumed that unlike his peers, Frank Capra is the one filmmaking great whose style would be hard to replicate nowadays given his often Pollyanna approach to triumph over evil and corruption.  But director Ivan Reitman and screenwriter Gary Ross do a fine job with this 1993 comedy in evoking Capra's individualistic style in a contemporary setting taking on a typically Capraesque subject, the U.S. President as a man of the people versus the puppet of lobbyists and corporate interests. I was surprised at the light touch Reitman displays here after his heavy-handed ""Ghostbusters"", but it is a charming and amusing fable that reminds me a bit of Hal Ashby's ""Being There"" in its acute observation of open navet in the face of seemingly insurmountable cynicism and duplicity.

The unlikely plot focuses on Dave Kovic, who runs a small-town employment agency and also happens to be the spitting image of Bill Mitchell, the forty-fourth President of the United States. In a night of passion, Mitchell suffers a stroke and goes into a coma. His megalomaniac chief-of-staff Bob Alexander and fearful communications director Alan Reed convince Dave to substitute for Mitchell while he recovers. Of course, the ruse gets complicated as Dave starts to take his new job quite seriously, which sets up a showdown with Alexander that brings in the then-relevant S&L scandals, and as Dave becomes attracted to Mitchell's estranged First Lady, Ellen. The casting is ideal. Other than Tom Hanks, no one but Kevin Kline could have portrayed Dave with such non-ironic decency and good humor. It's a shame his career has never taken off the way Hanks' has, as he seems to have moved recently to more sanctimonious dramas like ""Life as a House"" and ""The Emperor's Club"", movies that do not remotely capitalize on his chief assets, his acute sense of the absurd and graceful physical humor.  While Sigourney Weaver cuts a properly imposing and increasingly vulnerable figure as Ellen, I have to admit I find her a bit of a bore since there is not much emotional latitude with playing the First Lady. One misses the type of snappy, smart-mouthed dames that Jean Arthur and Barbara Stanwyck played to perfection in Capra's films. On the other hand, Frank Langella is almost effortlessly malevolent as Alexander, the perfectly insidious villain; though it would have been a stretch to think that such an obviously slimy character would have made it to the Oval Office without an image overhaul. The funny and underutilized Charles Grodin plays Murray Blum, Dave's accountant, who figures out the budget cuts the President should propose and sets Alexander's plans afire. Smaller roles are filled expertly with Ben Kingsley as the befuddled Vice-President, Ving Rhames appropriately one-note stoic as the head Secret Service agent and Laura Linney and Bonnie Hunt in miniscule parts.

There are plenty of enjoyable scenes, my favorites being the Dave-as-President scenes of suddenly recognized empowerment and genuine euphoria, the traffic cop incident ending with an off-key rendition of ""Tomorrow"", and  the montage of celebrities commenting on Mitchell's changed personality ending with Oliver Stone's amusing conspiracy theory.  Reitman and Ross have really come up with a holistic view of Washington politics that is at once acerbic and hopeful, not an unimpressive feat when one thinks of the tone of current political films. In fact, ""Dave"" is as much a comment on the early, idealized Clinton years, as sadly, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is of the junior Bush years. Great gentle fun.",1113609600,,3564,5.157439446366782

Dave Kovic, as a look alike for the President, is used to fill in while the President, shall we say, crosses off a Clintonesque agenda item.  Suffering a permanently debilitating stroke, the President is holed up in a secret chamber of the white house.  Not wanting the benevolent, publicly minded Vice President to assume power, the cheif of staff has Dave fill in.  This ruse falls apart when Dave finds himself furthering goals that are inconsistent with his own values.  He also finds that he has been used, as he was told that the Vice President was mentally unstable.  Rather, the Vice President, starred by Ben Kingsley is a public minded servant of the people.

Dave fires his cheif of staff, after which, the entirely unlikable cheif decides he's going to bring down Dave.  Without giving it away, Dave gets the last laugh and the nation is turned over to right-minded leadership.

Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver really make this movie.  I also liked the minor role of the big, tough, secret service agent, who as it turns out has a heart of gold.

A cross between MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON and THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER the movie is entertaining and fun to watch due to Kevin Kline's performance in a semi-dual role.  He's Dave Kovic,a temp agency manager, who is a dead-ringer for the President of the United States, Bill Mitchell. Dave is tapped to take over the presidency when Mitchell suffers a irreversible stroke during an extramarital rendezvous.  Dave becomes President ""in-body"" only becoming a puppet to the the President's Chief of Staff, Bob Alexander (played to villianous perfection by Frank Langella).  At first he just follows along but then gets caught up in the ""job"" when the fine line between pretending and reality gets broken.  This is further enhanced when the First Lady, Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver) comes into the picture. The most hilarious segment is when President ""Dave"" brings in his accountant buddy Murray (Charles Grodin) to tweak the national budget in order to save some homeless shelters that the First Lady is counting on. What works in this film is the human element bringing plausibility to an absurd premise. Kevin Kline's performance brings to mind a Jimmy Stewart-type performance (hence the reference to Capra-esque and ""Mr Smith..."") and the support roles are spot-on perfect.  Charles Grodin's Murray Blum is small, but it's very effective and funny. Sigourney Weaver is good as always. Kevin Dunn as Alan Reed does a great job as Bob/Langella's co-conspirator who gets a change-of-heart about Dave. Ben Kinglsey as vice-President Nash has a great intimate scene with Dave/Kline. Lastly, Ving Rhames as Duane, the no-nonsense presidential body-guard is excellent (""I'd taken a bullet for you!""). The film is very topical for its day as comments are shown from TONIGHT SHOW host Jay Leno and there is very hilarious segment as Oliver Stone, fresh from making JFK thinks there is a conspiracy and urging Larry King and the public to compare photographs of 'President Mitchell' before and after his ""stroke"".  Overall, a very entertaining  film from Ivan (GHOSTBUSTERS) Reitman that works because of great casting and characters and making something seemingly impossibe..believable.

1347026,4,B00004RYKP,"There's something about Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver, the same quiet but pensive chemistry that layered ""Ordinary People"". Far as I am concerned that's reason enough to recommend this obviously implausible but ponderous jump through far-fetched political hoops.

 The premise is so loose it dangles -- an incumbent US president becomes terminally ailed (hints of satire in how that happens) only to be temporarily faux-replaced with a lookalike, who in turn develops a conscience but effortlessly fools the entire coterie of house helpers, senate and the public at large.

 Some characters such as a certain malicious minister and his crony are so cardboard you could punch right through them, which is indeed what you end up wishing you could do. There's even a cameo by Ben Kingsley, ever the confident propreitor of the moment, as the wrongly accused vice president.

 Yet, it must be the magnetic screen presence of Kline with his comic chips firmly in place or some fairly resonating dialogue that overcomes the highly porous plotline. I delayed sleep in the wee hours to sit through these proceedings with rapt attention, and the denouement is very rewarding as it wraps everything up in 'correct' ribbons.

 Political conscience and subdued romance when smoothly blended and lightly stirred make for a very refreshing drink. To this charming social fable that celebrates common man's idealism I say: Slurp.",1091750400,,1417,5.211453744493392
1347027,5,B00004RYKP,"Simultaneously, this film offers both implausibilities and delightful entertainment, with several appealing suggestions as to which values the president of the United States should affirm and which priorities should guide and inform the president's initiatives. Directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Kevin Kline as Dave Kovic, the basic situation is this: Bill Mitchell, the current president, suffers a massive stroke while abed with one of his mistresses and is totally incapacitated, sustained by life support technologies. Kovic has been earning a modest living as a Mitchell impersonator and accepts an offer from Mitchell's chief of staff (Bob Alexander) skillfully portrayed by Frank Langella) to take on a full-time assignment to replace Mitchell. What is Alexander's objective? To ensure that his political power base is protected. For a while, Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver) is deceived because she and her husband had had almost no personal contact in recent years. Other than Alexander, his accomplice Alan Reed (Kevin Dunn) and Duane Stevenson (Ving Rhames, also brilliant as the Secret Service agent in charge), the First Lady and everyone else think that Kovic is Mitchell. And then....

I have no problem with the implausibilities because they create so many opportunities to affirm the the aforementioned values which, in my opinion, define ""compassionate conservatism."" For example, with the aid of his accountant and friend Murray Blum (Charles Grodin is also brilliant), Kovic is able to save a compellingly humanitarian project by trimming hundreds of millions of waste from the federal budget. This situation reminds me of one which sets up the climax in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) when a filibuster by interim Senator Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) defeats a pork barrel bill and thereby protects a Boy Rangers camp. Naive? Corny? Unrealistic? Perhaps to some but so what? I admire Dave because this contemporary version of ""The Prince and the Pauper"" has crisp direction, an engrossing plot, charm, wit, and stellar acting. The performance by Ben Kingsley (as Vice President Vance) is also noteworthy but I still have apprehensions about including news media journalists (playing themselves) such as Bernard Kalb, Larry King, John McLaughlin, and Helen Thomas. One clever touch is the cameo appearance by Oliver Stone who offers a conspiracy theory to explain President Mitchell's ""bizarre"" behavior. Those who share my high regard for Dave should check out Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Meet John Doe (1941), and Primary Colors (1998).",1091145600,,2573,5.4325
1347028,3,B00004RYKP,"The film ""Dave"" went through a script change. The story of a Presidential look-alike (Kevin Kline) who fills in for the secretly deceased real thing, the original story featured a Republican who brought his skills as a small entrepreneur to the job. Hollywood turned him into a Democrat, but kept his G.O.P common sense, such as when he and his partner look at the Federal budget and balance it by using the methods any small businessman would use. Naturally, pet liberal projects are all interjected while ""Republican priorities"" are given the heave-ho. You can search far and wide, and you will not find Hollywood films that openly portray a Democrat as the bad guy. I wrote a screenplay a few years ago called ""A Murderous Campaign"". It had all the elements of a great script. A beautiful porn star has an affair with a Democrat Louisiana Senator. She overhears him plotting the assassination of a political rival, but they find out she heard the plan. They try to kill her, so she goes into hiding and hooks up with a crusty old Washington reporter who is considered kooky because he has been accusing this Democrat of these crimes for years. A retired FBI friend of the reporter helps them. The Democrat announces a Presidential bid. The porn star uses her considerable charms and discovers that the Governor of New Jersey is the assassination target at a Statue of Liberty rally. She saves the Governor, and the plot is revealed, but the Democrat candidate goes into spin control. Nobody can really prove the plan. It looks like he will win the nomination, having weathered the politics of personal destruction. Finally, the porn girl and the reporter find the old father of the Democrat's chief of staff, a former Ku Klux Klansman who wants to get what he knows off his chest before passing from this mortal coil. He tells them about the drug smuggling operation the candidate has been running in the Louisiana Bayou. The reporter's FBI pal arranges a raid. They discover all the ""smoking gun"" evidence of a series of political murders going back years. The girl is re-united with her family, gets out of the porn business, the reporter wins the Pulitzer, and it is jail time for the Democrat. The end.
 Creative execs who loved the verbal pitch when I simply described the Democrat as a ""politician,"" a ""candidate"" or the ""Senator"" all passed when they read the part in the script that identifies him as an actual Democrat. Pamela Anderson would be perfect as the porn chick. I could see Denzel Washington as the reporter, and Gary Busey as the Democrat Senator. I was asked if I would change him to a Republican. My answer was that I wanted to maintain the realism of the story. See ya.

Now the man whom they have hired is Dave Kovic (Kevin Kline), a goodhearted man who likes to help people find jobs. After making his little exit, the real President suffers a stroke and is completely incapacitated.  The corrupt and manipulative Chief of Staff, Bob Alexander, plans to use Dave to elevate himself to the White House.

1347032,5,B00004RYKP,"Kevin Kline stars as Dave Kovic, an owner of a temporary employment agency.  He is hired to serve as a double for the President of the United States.  However, things don't turn out as planned and Dave finds himself continuing his charade.
The real President has suffered a stroke while making love to his secretary and Dave continues his impersonation.  The President's advisors don't want to inform Vice President Nance, played by Ben Kingsley, because Chief Of Staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) is jealous of him. Bob has his sights set on the Presidency, so he has sent the Vice President away on an African goodwill tour.  While the V.P. is gone, Bob begins digging up dirt about him.
Meanwhile, Dave continues to learn more about the Presidency, and he's taking over some of the Presidential tasks.  Eventually, he meets First Lady Helen Mitchell, played by Sigourney Weaver.  The real President and First Lady have a very rocky relationship and they rarely see each other, but Dave is attracted to he immediately.
Soon, Dave is making visits to factories and sitting in on Cabinet meetings, all the while charming everyone and watching the approval ratings soar.  While Dave is enjoying his success, Bob is seething.  He's angry that Dave has become so popular, and he fears losing his chance at the Presidency.  Also, Dave is beginning to see the schemer that Bob really is, and he asks for Bob's resignation.  This leads to Bob blowing the lid off a White House scandal involving the President and Vice President.  But due to some quick thinking by Dave, he manages to clear the Vice President and inform Congress that Bob was really behind the scandal.
While addressing Congress, Dave fakes a reoccurance of the stroke that plagued the real President, paving the way for Vice President Nance to take over as President.  Dave then goes back to work at his Temp agency, having decided to run for city council, and he gets a little help from the former First Lady as well.
I enjoyed this movie very much.  The acting is excellecnt.  Kevin Kline, Frank Langella, Sigourney Weaver, and Ben Kingsley give top notch performances.  This is a funny and uplifting movie and shows that the little guy can enjoy the limelight once in a while.",1045699200,,2243,4.8046875
1347033,5,B00004RYKP,"Hollywood has long bashed politicians in its films. Usually, these greasy-palmed lechs are seen as no more than variations of Willy Stark from ALL THE KING'S MEN. But there have been a few notable exceptions: MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, and now director Ivan Reitman presents Kevin Kline as the sainted president-imposter of DAVE. The plot is nonsense, of course. Kline is a businessman who bears a stunning resemblance to the real president who unexpectedly suffers a stroke. Frank Langella, who also bears an equally stunning resemblance in both looks and attitude to former Nixon henchman Bob Haldeman, recruits Kline to stand in for the president. Kline's imposture is so convincing that everyone, including the president's wife (Sigourney Weaver), is fooled. Langella sees Kline only as a buffoon, easily manipulated until he is ready to annoint himself as the new president.
The joy of DAVE is watching an updated version of the fish out of water routine. Kline is genuinely funny as he struggles to master the protocol needed to run the free world. What gives DAVE a touching resonance is the subtle transformation of Kline as the admitted fish out of water to a good-hearted human being who slowly realizes that the power of the presidency can do far more for America than merely enrich the one who sits in the Oval Office. Even the burgeoning romance between Kline as the fake president and Weaver who thinks him the real thing is touching. Director Reitman diluted the focus of interest with a deluge of cameos of famous politicians and Hollywood stars, all of whom do little more than add one moment of cheap laughs in a movie that tries hard for serious laughs about serious issues that range from who we are to who we might be. It is the totality of questions about the need to establish our moral center in our rightful identity that makes DAVE such a refreshing breath of air after the thundering blasphemies of that self-appointed crude politico Willy Stark.",1041638400,,2024,4.886627906976744

There are several memorable scenes: the First Lady and Kline impersonating themselves at a street fair, for example. My favorite character here, though, is the Secret Service man responsible for looking after Kline. His final scene with Kline is touching and prompts a ""yes"" response.
Washington would do well to have more ""imitators"" like Kline.

1347038,5,B00004RYKP,"What would you do, as a fulfillment of office, if you were given the chance to stand-in for the President of the United States? ""Dave"" answers this question in a light political comedy that is sure to please anyone. The film may not be as intelligent a material as ""The American President,"" but it is still a winner in its own right, and much more.
A stroke while on adulterous sex has the incumbent President incapacitated by stroke, and look-alike Dave is secretly planted into the position by the scheming Chief of Staff to prevent the ""Boy Scout"" VP from taking it otherwise (the movie leaves us to deduce much of the Chief's hidden agenda. It is quite bloody when you think about it.) Other than a breach in democracy and the breaking of a multitude of laws, what follows is the heartwarming story of a White House adventure that is very satirical, endearing, funny, melancholic and ultimately romantic.
Originally, I thought of giving this film four stars, but changed my mind since having noticed that it got better and better with each viewing. Having seen this film more than once, I also found out that what makes ""Dave"" work is not only its ability to warm the heart, but to make it soar as well. We find a connection with Dave (Kevin Kline) that makes us want to give him a big hug for the things he did in the White House. What is mostly curious is the movie's ability to arouse the pride of the nation, all the while saying (and portraying) that ""the country has a lot of problems that we don't want to face them anymore.""
The wonderful storyline is seasoned with:
1.) lots of excellent performances (to name one, watch Frank Langella silently boil over as he helplessly watches Dave do cuts with the budget,)
2.) lots of cameos by real-life politicians, and personalities from TV, film and media, lending credibility to an otherwise incredible story.
3.) lots of comic moments,
4.) some one-line punchers such as Sigourney Weaver's ""Go to hell..."" (for a 1993 movie, this remark seems to hail a future event,) Charles Grodin's ""Get out of here as fast as you can!"", and the sudden and uncalled for remark of the real president, "" &iexcl;Kjust get rid of that grin, you look like a schmuck.""
5.) and at least a seemingly irrelevant (and short) but ultimately funny scene where the dialogue veered into the topic of thick necks and sweaters.
This movie is bound to raise different kinds of questions. It makes us ask why things are always otherwise than that of the movie. Could be that this is bred from our want of political heroes, something which our modern world lacks and lacks and lacks. My answer, ""Let the film inspire you."" However on the other side, one will find implausible such a scenario as the film's premise. My answer, ""Who cares??""",1016323200,,2763,4.629327902240326
1347039,4,B00004RYKP,"Though this film was directed by Ivan Reitman, it's the screenwriter's picture all the way.  Gary Ross has made his reputation spinning stories of innocents caught up in the world of the not-so-innocent--or vice versa.  With Big, starring Tom Hanks, it was a 12-year old magically transformed into a 30 year old man, contending with the world of grownups.  In his latest film, Pleasantville, it's two hip, decidedly uninnocent teenagers zoomed into the innocent world of a typical 50s TV show.
In this, his middle film, it's the owner of a copy shop, Dave, called on to impersonate the president--a high strung cad who's just suffered a heart attack.  Dave is a heck of a lot more innocent than most guys his age.  Divorced, he busies himself with his work and sports, always hoping to meet the right woman.
What's groovy about this film is that it's a hip, comic American remake of the great Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha.  In that film--a powerful drama with no comedy at all--a grievously ill warlord tells his vassals to find a man who resembles him as closely as possible so the warlord can instruct the other man in the ways of ruling a region; if his subjects see him alive and healthy, they'll be reassured and spies from enemy regions will know he's still a force to be reckoned with.
The vassals find a commoner whose resemblance to the warlord is so striking, there's no one else who could do the job.  He's told exactly what to do, how to stand, sit, and do all the other stuff a warlord should.  The same happens in Dave--he learns what to do from the evil Frank Langella, the White House press secretary.  As Dave, Kevin Kline strikes the perfect balance of innocence and determination to right the wrongs so clearly in evidence.  And Sigourney Weaver does a more than credible job as the first lady who's charmed by this knowledgeable innocent.
Also here are Ben Kingsley as the just as innocent Vice President (contrast this with his absolutely astounding performance in the recent Sexy Beast as a nasty rotten gangster!) and Ving Rhames, always reliable, as the secret service man who's on Dave's side all the way.
Ross is one smart cookie.  Taking Kagemusha and updating it to 90s America, mixing it with big dollops of comedy and a poignant love story, was a great idea.  This film really works.  Take a look at Ross' other films; they're just as great.",1011916800,,2369,4.679518072289157

Kline (Silverado, A Fish Called Wanda) portrays a likable man with an uncanny resemblence to the President of the United States, also played by Kline.  The unlikable president has a stroke while having an affair with his assistant and Kline steps in to pinch hit while the nearly dead president stuggles to live.  (This is not the only film where Kline plays the president. He also portrayed President Grant in the forgetable Wild, Wild West).
Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Ghostbusters, Gorillas in the Mist)  plays the wife who no longer loves her wandering husband and presents the greatest challange for Dave.  He must convince her that he is her husband and at first succeeds.  But once she realizes that the president is not her husband, things really get interesting.
Frank Langella portrays the bad guy with verve, convincingly creating the constitutional crisis.  Ving Rhames plays a Secret Service agent in the role that lit his career, Ben Kingsley makes a quick entrance as the vice-president, and Laura Linney plays Randi, the President's assistant who is with him when he has the stroke.  She is best known for her role as Jim Carrey's wife in the Truman Show.
A number of characters who were politically important or recently washed up take a turn in front of the camera, as do talk show regulars.  I think this was one of the first films to call on political commentators and politicians to make it seem real.

Pay special attention to the scene when he examines himself as both Dave and the President.  The chemistry between Kline and Signourney Weaver is also capitivating.

Sigourney  Weaver is similarly fantastic as the strong and independent First Lady who  finds herself becoming attracted to the Presidential impostor. Fill the  rest of the cast with great performances from some well-known character  actors and you have DAVE.

This is definitely a  movie to buy because it needs to be seen many times.  The innumerable funny  pearls in this movie alone are worth the price of the DVD.  For  Minnesotans, one of the slyest gags was Dave's gig early in the moview,  imitating the President at the grand opening of Durenberger Motors in his  home town.  The movie was released around the time that David Durenberger  (Minnesota's senior senator) was embroiled in an ethics scandal.  A  personal favorite moment was the scene where Dave (with the help of his  accountant buddy played by Charles Grodin) pares the federal budget to save  a homeless shelter for children -- the cabinet members bemusedly  participating just like a family sitting around the kitchen table wrestling  with its own budget.
