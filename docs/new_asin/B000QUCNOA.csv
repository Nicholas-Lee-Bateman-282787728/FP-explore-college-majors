2840225,4,B000QUCNOA,"I had previously viewed this film; I bought it because of the storyline and the brilliant acting of Vanessa Redgrave (Angelina...what happened?)
Everyone should mediate on the message of this film. The subject matter should be one of the great 21rst century challenges as to social justice and equality. Was very satisfied--I got what I ordered.",1443830400,,345,5.178571428571429
2840226,4,B000QUCNOA,"An interesting movie, with a unique viewpoint, and one that I think more people need to see.",1430265600,,92,4.470588235294118
2840227,5,B000QUCNOA,"An interesting (Docu-Drama) movie presentation, done in an unusual way and setting. Historical theme that's plagued mankind for ages yet shrouded in dilemma of a more current setting. Measure progress, wealth & growth realizing true costs, worth and limitations? Thought provoking and eye opening. A Dark movie, with streaks of illumination which admittedly cast more shadows on reality of the World. Sadly it's too close to home for me. Even though its never mentioned it sure described the Balkans (ex-YU region) to a tee. Highly recommended, but demands a captive audience. Great for Social Studies classroom or Geo Political junkies. A Stage Play should-have-been!",1385337600,2,668,5.4326923076923075
2840228,5,B000QUCNOA,"Not knowing what to expect, I sat down with my morning coffee to watch Vanessa Redgrave, a true privledge any day.  One does not expect to face challenges to one's societal norms over their morning coffee but this was to be that morning.  The Fever is a philosophical shock.  Jesus said, the poor you will always have with you but not him.  Perhaps what he meant is that there will always be Jesus or someone like him to remind us of our common bond, our humanity, for Jesus was poor, as was Gandhi, Buddha, Mother Teresa and so many others with true compassion.  This movie is crafted to challenge our fundamental belief in equality while maintaining fiscal classes, in our right to acquire more than others - where consumptions are small but continual.  As with Brown vs the Board of Education, separate but equal cannot exist in a true republic.

I don't know if a movie can change a society but it can start a new trajectory and this movie certainly makes the attempt.  It's not easy, comfortable or even necessarily desirable: after all, could it be made, could I watch if, I were not using those consumables?  So, I give this high marks while recognizing the trajectory diversion will be miniscule.  Look at a globe, drawn a new circumfrance line .1 degree off the current equator - eventually you will cover the globe.  Gradual change is never fast enough but it is inevitable.

Don't expect to be glad you saw this movie.  Don't let that stop you from understanding it.  It's not Ayn Rand but it's not Karl Marx, either.",1363305600,4,1528,4.590405904059041
2840229,4,B000QUCNOA,"As already noticed, Vanessa Redgrave does a wonderful job playing... herself.  I'm not so sure Angelina Jolie is quite there yet; had I decided to go through the labor of filming in such an evocative place, I'd have settled for an authentic actress of that place.  Angelina starts credible, but soon loses it and reverts to her being an American in language and all that.  Michael Moore is again OK, but his name in real life looms larger than his character's.  All in all, 4 out of 5 stars for acting.

The story line is an entirely different animal.  It starts by expanding the context of comfort for your typical westerner by considering the banality of evil in a nearby place, not known or seen despite its relative proximity.  They could have chosen those kids in, say, Africa who disassemble electronic debris from the west, or some plantation workers, but such images have already been re-presented time and again and they must be soliciting by now  mild indignation at best.  No, the film makers don't choose such images to show the body of the iceberg we know only by its tip and call western affluence.  They go into a place where people are Christian, and white, and (civil-)war-torn.  Aha, so misfortune in this life is not ethnic as much as is geo-graphic. Since this 1/2 of the story is about the nearby geographies of misfortune in places we might mistake for our own, how do the filmmakers represent them and their peoples' struggles?  Oops, from the perspective of the western newspaper reader.  Yup, there's nothing to show they understand the drama of these places other than the cycle whereby a bunch of deceitful cynics replace a bunch of careless cynics.

What does the character of Redgrave do?  After becoming aware and the ensuing moral crisis, she settles in some sort of moral relativism...  I guess, this is as real as it gets, for those few and well meant westerners who venture that far have to return.  Much fewer of these try to actually go beyond, but they may well be the saints of our days.",1305504000,5,2025,4.659154929577465
2840230,5,B000QUCNOA,"A beautifully orchestrated short opera by American Composer Robert Ward with text by Roger Brunyate. The opera is based on a story ""Roman Fever"" written by Edith Wharton.  It is story about two American 40-year widows who were friends in Rome in the 1920s (when they were flappers), and one was engaged and had a fiance there.  They return 20 years later and each has a 20-year-old daughter.  Thus a great drama unfolds over their past.  This is a great one-hour opera for those who haven't been exposed to operas as it is short and written in English.  The staging and music is beautiful, performers have stunning voices with all the drama and emotion of an opera. Robert Ward is among the first contemporary American composers who is best known for his Opera, the ""Crucible,"" which he won a 1962 Pulitzer Prize.  He has written a number of wonderful operas, so I found this short opera very enjoyable and fresh.",1264550400,,913,4.675
2840231,5,B000QUCNOA,"Ok. This is one of those movies--few, sadly--that easily leads viewers to: 1, turn it off, commenting to dismayed, similarily bothered fellow on-lookers, ""that's depressing!"" as they seal the Netflicks envelope, or 2) ""wow...there is something profound in the message here, and even if I am not ready to really sit with it, this is important stuff.""

What runs over the character deftly played by Redgrave, are the subtle and pervasive ways selfishness, self-absorbtion, and cognitive short cuts are used by humans--typically of the well-healed classes, who possess more influence for change--as they bypass crimes carried out across the world. Ok. We've heard this before e.g., Jesus, Socrates, Ghandi, Biko, MLK, RFK, Marx and yes, even Michael Moore in his way. But Redgrave's confronting of her comission in the way things operate arrests. I suspect that few with a conscience, who look authentically at themselves, the world around, will remain unaffected. Spiritual, Economic, Political, Moral. This is revolutionary.

Well done.",1198540800,16,1035,5.4625
2840232,5,B000QUCNOA,"Although categorized as Drama, this film is best thought of as a cinematic essay - one woman's affecting reflection on the mysteries of life, morality, politics, right and wrong in a complex world, the sort of stuff you may get from a good Charlie Rose interview but at a surprising depth.  For a film consisting largely of Ms. Redgrave's ruminations in the form of a voice-over monologue, it was unexpectedly engaging.  It asks all the right questions, even if it doesn't always have the satisfying answers.

There is something of a back story, but the story is basically besides the point.  Although a lot of the filming was apparently done in Croatia and the location looks vaguely Eastern European, the fictional country that much of the story takes place in is never named.  On the one occasion that someone pointed to a map of the country on a wall, oddly enough it was a map of China - you can clearly see Taiwan and Hainan off the coast.

Ms. Redgrave's character is in practically every frame, and every other character is basically a cameo.  Michael Moore, who gets second billing, did a competent if not particularly demanding job playing a war correspondent in a single scene lasting about 3 minutes.  The only actor that comes close to being a bona fide co-star is on screen for 6-7 minustes but she is not even mentioned on the jacket.  That would be Angelina Jolie, who brings remarkable emotional depth to an otherwise small role.",1197763200,19,1446,4.7063492063492065
2840233,5,B000QUCNOA,"I caught this on HBO and Vanessa Redgrave was fabulous. Surprisingly good performances from Angelica Jolie and Michael Moore (yes, THAT Michael Moore), too! I'm looking forward to the DVD release.",1195430400,8,196,5.354838709677419

A must see. I don't want to give it away because it evolves as time passes.
Self examination and honesty are the keys to this. If you are desirous of seeing or learning about the process of letting go of the burden of lies in your life or which make up your life. You will like this. If you are not interested in self examination or watching one go through due to a myriad of
experiences, then skip this. But, if you love good acting and a fabulous story line and script more than an action flick...this is for you. I could not take my eyes away for second.",1465430400,2,609,4.213675213675214
2840263,5,B000QUCNOA,"Dear Reader,
See this film. --If you have ever questioned the appetites of your own egoic drives, see this film.  If you've ever experienced a chain of strange coincidences that reflect the edges of your current state of self-awareness, see this film.  If you love great acting, click the clicker and see this film.
The only bad thing I can say after seeing this film is that I'm deeply troubled that Carlos Gabriel Nero has not made more films.  The original writer, Wallace Shawn, has done some spiritual heavy lifting for all of us, and for that I am grateful.  SM",1451606400,,567,4.584158415841584
8197390,1,B000QUCNOA,"A great cast and fine writing, but ultimately the movie is a dull story that revolves around far-leftist politics, and not in a particularly interesting way.  The nave ramblings of the bourgeois main character are as vapid as the leftist platitudes of the people who are supposed to be teaching her about the way the world should be.  'This ice cream is nice, but shouldn't the milk be given to the children'",1521331200,,408,4.652777777777778
8197391,1,B000QUCNOA,"Boring, dry dialogue which only serves to further the preachy, progressive Hollywood narrative. Obese celebrity Michael Moore eating ice cream while condemning the nation for using it's limited supply of milk to make it instead of ""milk for the children"" was surreal and too funny.

8197392,1,B000QUCNOA,The best part of this movie was Vanessa Redgraves' wardrobe.  It was beautiful.  The movie itself went on and on about poverty and wealth and the uneven distribution of money and power.  After a while it become extremely boring even though I love Vanessa Redgrave as an actress.

8197395,5,B000QUCNOA,"Thought provoking, and at times depressing, but a wonderful story about coming to grips with how the rich view and deal with the poor and how few of the upper class of society can really see through the eyes of the poor and destitute. It takes courage for someone in the main character's shoes to go outside her comfort zone and try to understand why there is such poverty and suffering in the world and to make sense of it all.",1498089600,,428,4.296296296296297
