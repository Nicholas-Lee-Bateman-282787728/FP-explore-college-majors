2712846,5,B000LQGV4W,"This is very well done and it has lots of content for one dvd. We also bought their ""Beginning Foxtrot"" which we also like. Even if you are experienced dancers I would suggest getting the Beginning Foxtrot before tackeling the intermediate.",1170115200,3,240,4.878048780487805
2712847,5,B000LQGV4W,"This is well done and there is a large amount covered on just one dvd. We have taken lessons for years but this is excellent because it is so clear and

it is nice to be able to refer to it any time to brush up in a particular area. This will work well whether you are just beginning or have lots of experience.

We also bought ""intermediate Foxtrot"" and are also pleased with it.",1170115200,,380,4.053333333333334

8163597,1,B000LQGV4W,"We are learning the ballroom foxtrot, so when I bought this I wasn't aware it was a social and not ballroom foxtrot. I suppose I expected it to focus on the posture, poise, footwork as the title was Intermediate instruction so I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it could have been made clearer as the title and the no. of stars made it a little misleading.  I do understand why it has quite a few stars because its a very good dvd if you want to learn a social foxtrot. We live in Ireland and I know now there are differences in the dance styles from the UK and America - maybe that needs to be made clearer.",1344384000,,617,4.133333333333334
8163598,5,B000LQGV4W,"Foster and Judy are excellent instructors!!  Rather than being a cheapskate, I wish I had started my dancing with their DVDs.  I've literally, without a partner, taught myself Foxtrot from their Foxtrot DVDs.  I have people ask me where did I learn some of my moves, and I tell them from the DVDs.  One CAVEAT:  It's easy to see that the DVDs were copied from video tapes.  However, I rate the video quality an 8 out of 10.  The instruction is clear and concise with plenty of examples.  I'm very happy with the quantity of moves.  The main menu and the sub-menus are a breeze to use and quickly find a specific location on the DVD.  I have gone on to purchase Bolero, Rumba, Samba, Mambo, Waltz, at discounted prices through Amazon.  Although, the DVDs come from ""Dance Lovers"" (the creators of the DVDs), the DVD containers do not come manufactured- wrapped.  No problems so far.",1237161600,,881,4.576923076923077

8163600,4,B000LQGV4W,"The production quality on this DVD isn't very good.  I looks like it was shot in the early eighties, and the picture is grainy.  That having been said, the teaching techniques are good, and the steps build on each other.  If you are a beginner looking to learn the rumba, this is a good choice.",1231718400,,294,4.3090909090909095
8163601,3,B000LQGV4W,"the quality of this dvd is not good, very grainy...poor copy, the instructors are a little out-dated (interms of clothing), the instruction however is good. That said I had been doing dance classes for 3 months and so I bsaically knew the steps demonstated already so I would havereturned it if I could, but I don't live in the US and it would be too difficult. I have however purchased their rumba intermediate which was better quality and i would recommend it!",1187913600,3,462,4.646341463414634
