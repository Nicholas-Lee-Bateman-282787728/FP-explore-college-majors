They seem to have wanted to re-make the classic in color, and I think they succeeded admirably. I have many, many Japanese movies, and I have bought copies of this one to give to friends.",1358553600,2,282,4.339622641509434
8356394,1,B0028MJH1Q,"I really wasn't expecting it to be good as the original version by Kurosawa and Mifune, but this is exceedingly bad.  I guess I was expecting a new interpretation of the characters and updated action sequences. No such luck.  This is almost a verbatim script of the original and worst of all it's as if the actors were trying to imitate the orginal cast down to facial expressions.  I wasn't expecting the masterful camera work of Kurosawa, but this one's down-right amaturish.  The actor playing Sanjuro just doesn't have the maturity, toughness, roughness, uncouthness of Mifune.  When they cast a younger actor, they should have let him reinvent the character.  Bottom line - watching this movie was like watching a mediocre high school production based on a classic movie.",1310601600,4,776,4.976744186046512
