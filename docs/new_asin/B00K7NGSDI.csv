6404264,5,B00K7NGSDI,"Offbeat and quirky, but strangely charming...just what you'd expect from O'Dowd.",1424390400,,80,6.363636363636363
6404265,5,B00K7NGSDI,"This is a super cute, sweet, slightly ridiculous, brilliantly acted show.  Chris O'Dowd is fantastic, and the young boy lead is outstanding. All of the other actors, both children and adults, are perfectly casted and are all also wonderfully talented comedic actors.",1418515200,,266,5.333333333333333
6404266,5,B00K7NGSDI,A really great sitcom about a young boy growing up (with the help of his imaginary friend) in a little Irish town in the late 80's early 90's. Also great period soundtrack.,1418515200,,172,4.40625
6404267,5,B00K7NGSDI,So funny.,1417219200,,9,4.0

6404269,5,B00K7NGSDI,This show is the best- An excellent follow up to the hit first season. Martin's family is charmingly functionally dysfunctional and the humor is in the little things. I grew up a few years behind Martin so it is funny to see this coming of age comedy set in the years of my youth.,1413676800,,280,4.203703703703703
6404270,5,B00K7NGSDI,"At last the hit comedy is back with another six episodes of nostalgic Irish fun. Martin Moone has an imaginary friend Sean played by co-writer and great actor Chris O'Dowd. This series picks up where the last left off. Martin is now going to `Big School' along with best mate and part time cross dresser Padraic. His eldest sister is now heavy with child thanks to the less than charismatic religious organiser and loud shirt wearing Dessie.

This time the situations will range from Irelands' entry to the Football World Cup in 1990 and a less than idyllic family holiday. Martins first day at school, his first love with a free wheelin `art teacher'; and the school disco sans alcohol but very much avec embarrassment. An ingenious if unreliable ghost ship for the Halloween special - watch out for Jonny Vegas playing invisible friend `Crunchie Haystacks'. Ireland's answer to squash with a show down of handball where Simon Day plays a golfing ghost, the wedding and a group of travellers moving in to the field next to the Moones'.

I loved the first series and downloaded these as they became available and they are every bit as good as the first outing. All the same actors play all the main characters and it is hard to single anyone out as being brilliant as they all put in such great performances which just compliment each other. Whilst still not as big as it ought to be I feel with the rise of Chris O'Dowd as a recognised talent it is only a matter of time before these little gems get the full attention they most definitely deserve.",1400284800,4,1549,4.608695652173913

Reminds me of The Middle...",1451692800,,127,4.333333333333333
6404273,5,B00K7NGSDI,It is worth watching the show just for the actor's facial expressions. Moone Boy is clever and unique. I'm anxiously waiting on Season 3 to be released in the US.,1444262400,,162,4.433333333333334

6404278,5,B00K7NGSDI,"Moore Boy is sure to be a cult classic. Highly quotable, witty, clever and strangely grounded despite its eccentric premise. If they release it on DVD compatible with US players I would buy all the seasons.",1434931200,,206,4.75

6404282,5,B00K7NGSDI,"If you are a fan of the old PBS British comedies, you will enjoy Moone Boy.  It is a very funny series about a quirky Irish family and very well cast.",1432166400,,150,3.838709677419355
6404283,5,B00K7NGSDI,Love Moone Boy. We had purchased series one and couldn't resist when we saw series two available. I find myself grinning while I'm watching this!!,1432080000,,146,4.88

6404289,5,B00K7NGSDI,"A fantastic comedy by Chris O'Dowd that has so much hidden comedy and nuances, that it may take a couple, if not several viewings to grasp all comedy and references. Plus, Martin, Sean and Padraic's adventures, as well as the whole extended Moone family bring you into the streets of Boyle, Ireland in a ""hand buzzer"" of laughs.",1425686400,,328,4.672413793103448

8656591,5,B00K7NGSDI,"I have never actually peed in my pants from laughing at a TV show before, so either this show is hilarious or I'm enjoying premature incontinence. Let's pretend it's the former. I grew up in Ireland and was a teenager misspending my youth in an alcoholic haze at the time the show is set so it's nice to relive the innocent childhood I missed. Or might have missed if I was a lovable gobshite from Boyle. Familiar enough for me to love such fantastic touches as the 'Grange Hill' theme song but generally appealing enough for my 8 and 10 year old (American) kids to think its the best TV ever and to call each other eejits for days. There's not a lot of TV we can all enjoy together and I get serious mileage bribing them with an episode of Moone Boy as a reward. They loved the books as well.
