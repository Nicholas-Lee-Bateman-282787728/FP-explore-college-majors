5277542,4,B0099115TQ,"My gripe:  A less than perfect review because of $$ Price $$ and approach to have the seasons split in two. The PLUS:  tremendous show, great season with suspense-packed episodes!  DVD quality is pretty decent: bright colors and crisp/good images.  All in all, price asides, I commend Warner Bros for putting out this set and rescuing my household from the garbage that evening reality TV has become.  My family room is a better place to hang out because my wife and I can re-live these, and my kids get to see what a show created by talented scriptwriters looks like.  Thanks WB!!! ...Keep'em rolling...Can't wait for more sets to come out!",1348790400,11,641,4.72972972972973

5277573,5,B0099115TQ,This is the first set of discs for the third season of this classic T.V. program.  Once you have seen it you will want to buy the part two of this series as the F.B.I. was one of those programs that provided both drama and plenty of action. Buy parts one and two together and I guarantee you will like this show.,1429574400,,312,4.032258064516129

I guess  J. Edgar didn't mind as FORD was sponsoring the series. All the Quinn Martin series were well done...I highly recommend.",1411603200,,397,5.107692307692307

5277599,5,B0099115TQ,"Warner Archives recently started releasing the First Run batches of their
Multiple disc-Sets (TV Series) as Sets with factory-pressed DVDs.
Can someone comment here - when Amazon starts to offer those DVD Sets - if these are
also factory-pressed discs (despite their DVD-R media note)?
Or does Amazon indeed sell those Warner DVD Sets on burned DVD-R Media
unlike Warner Archives who sell factory-pressed discs?
That would be interesting to know ...

5277603,3,B0099115TQ,"I had been deliberating for a long time whether to buy a FBI season or not, now after buying them I am sorry I did.
Amazon did an excellent job of getting them to me in very quick time and I looked forward to seeing the discs. Now I doubt I will ever bother, what a waste of money.  Fore the money spent on these discs. I would expect top quality/

The sound is OK and so is the definition, but the the colour rendition of the faces and reds is ridiculous. The faces are nearly orange and the dessert scenes are oversaturated. So are other colours.
I cannot understand why these DVDs gets such good reviews.  The story lines and acting may be good, but what is the point when the colour rendition transfer is as bad as it is . It spoils the worth of watching them.  No more orders of The FBI for me. I do not who was responsible for the transfer of these series, but they did a terrible job. They want to try emulatiing a transfer of the Series ""The Virginian"" and some others I could mention, these are real quality/",1353456000,4,1017,4.147208121827411

5277605,5,B0099115TQ,"Having already purchased and watched the first two seasons of The F.B.I., I was looking forward to season 3. Now that I am watching it I find it is even better than the first two seasons. I enjoy William Reynolds in the role of Erskine's partner. The scripts and production values seem improved in season 3, and the transfer to DVD either used cleaner copies or was remastered, since these prints are very good visually. They also abandoned the rather crude animations of Washington landmarks in the opening titles that were formerly used and this results in a cleaner start to the show.

Disk #2 is especially good, with a fine 2-part episode featuring Arthur Hill, and another episode I particularly enjoyed that is set in the middle of an electrical blackout that features the late Diana Hyland at the pinnacle of her loveliness. While these sets are relatively pricey, if you enjoy TV series of this era there are few better. I highly recommend this and am looking forward to season #4.",1353110400,9,990,4.722543352601156

8537713,2,B0099115TQ,"SEE BELOW ON THE DISCS THEMSELVES: - Bought Season 3,4, 8 and 9 from 2 different resellers - all Seasons had MOD Discs with circular markings, scratches and dark blemishes

Though there is no remastering or cleanup of any kind (to the best of my knowledge although one season shows Dolby mono but not the others best I can tell), the plain film transfers are quite good. Our Blu-ray/DVD player did a great job on the output presentation with very minimal if any noticeable noise or artifacts even on a 78"" screen where just about every anomaly appears . The picture format was also set to 16:9 vs 4:3 ratio which also maintained very enjoyable (albeit slightly stretched) watching quality. Optimally we set our audio receiver to ""Mono"" which is a match for the audio output on these discs. The audio was not muddy and rather clean but of course it lacked much dimension. Both the music score and voice could be heard clearly without strain (we have a Denon receiver 5.1 sound). Additionally I had also performed an additional satisfactory test by playing one DVD (disc 1) on our computer (non Blu-ray) to a 50"" plasma TV screen and it too appeared quite good as well as the audio which was listened to via good quality closed ear (non ear buds) headphones.
Setting the performances and episodes aside (which I would rate between a 3.5 and 5), all things considered, this would get a 5 star on the straight film transfer to digital on Warner Brothers part. Perhaps for the small ransom they are asking though, surely something else could have been included such as bonus material, interviews, outtakes and so on as with the Quinn Martin ""Invaders"" series where Roy Thinnes has multiple introductions and the unedited pilot was included. The FBI film transfers show minute bits of dust, scratches and other anomalies only on rare occasion. The color prints held up quite well without any noticeable fading or color degradation overall. If you have an audio receiver I'd suggest flipping through your sound modes and check out the mono option if it exists. Overall I would certainly recommend this Season 9 except for the MODS - continue reading.

UPDATE: The packaging itself is a different story. Since we all don't play the disc right away I opted after a few days to inspect all the discs and found markings on Disc 1,2, 5 and 6. Well it gets worse from here. I ordered Season 9 with two damaged discs. Season 4 all seven discs had fine small scratches, two had blotch stains. Season 3 all but one disc had markings. one was acceptable, the others all had small scratches and or circular markings. These MOD discs are unacceptable especially at this price. It's hard to blame the reseller. Season 3 and 4 I had ordered from deepdiscount.com, a different vendor though they resell here on Amazon also. It's difficult to buy another FBI disc until WB remedies this issue. I have written to them with my receipts and evidence of purchase and photos. They have agreed to replace season 8 and 9. Awaiting a reply for Season 3 and 4. I've included a sample image of what you can expect with these discs. I am confident this is clearly a handling issue at the WB plant where they are burned and packaged.",1471046400,,3198,4.658407079646017
