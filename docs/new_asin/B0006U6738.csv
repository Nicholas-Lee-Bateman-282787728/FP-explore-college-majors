8043327,3,B0006U6738,"You can probably find this DVD at a $1.00 or $0.99 bargain store and that is where it belongs. Three of the four episodes are from either VHS or many generation dupes of soft film prints. The four episodes are in order: Halloween Party with a very young Ricky; Rick Gets Even, with Ricky at 16 or 17 years; The Duenna with Ricky at about 12; and, An Evening with Hamlet, with Ricky around 9 or 10. Only Rick Gets Even is from a good, sharp print. The other three are watchable but there are many other collections with better such as those from the Shout Factory or Mill Creek. Watching these on a good monitor only decreases viewing pleasure, so watch on a small portable DVD player or computer screen.",1213488000,,703,4.374045801526718
8043328,1,B0006U6738,"Sure, for only $5 or so it sounds like a great deal.  But what I dislike about this packaging, like so many DVDs, is that they do not provide details of the contents.  There are only 4 episodes.  The particular purpose for me buying this video was the early year indicated on the package.  Yet only 1 episode contains the young boys.  The boys are all grown up and working at the law firm for the rest of episodes.  So, I say, like Aunt Bee says, ""fiddle faddle.""",1211155200,5,463,4.204545454545454
