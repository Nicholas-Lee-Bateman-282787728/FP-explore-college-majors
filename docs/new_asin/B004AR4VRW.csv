4310716,5,B004AR4VRW,"Freedom Riders is a powerful movie about a significant, nation-changing moment in the United States.  It documents a six-month period in 1961 during which brave, determined Black and White university students, travelling together by bus from Washington, D.C., into the deep south, confronted southern segregation at great personal risk and injury.  What started as a small group of about two dozen university students turned into a national movement involving several hundred students from across the country.  Their experiences were broadcast throughout the nation and the world and forced the federal government to confront segregation in a way that it (the government) really didn't want to.  The material is well researched and well presented.  It includes film clips from newscasts and home movies of the time, current and recent interviews with participants, their supporters, their opponents and government officials, and even a Greyhound bus commercial.  The film doesn't sugarcoat the story, but transmits the tension and drama, and even moments of humor, to the viewer.  While many will be familiar with the general story of the Freedom Riders, I don't doubt that the film contains details that will be new to almost everyone, if not to absolutely everyone.  As a document of one of the major blows to segregation, this is a film that should be seen by everyone, and won't easily be forgotten.",1305590400,38,1403,5.260089686098655

Something that I believe should have been part of history when I was in school. I ordered about 6 copies of this movie to send to family members and friends. The young people in this movie changed many things for all people. It was like GOD had sent them. They stood together and would not physically fight back, they were ready to die for the rights of all people. Young people standing together of different races. GOD bless them.",1454544000,,536,4.37

4310738,5,B004AR4VRW,"I used this film in my US history class and in all 4 of my classes, students were both riveted and inspired. I don't generally use film, or at least entire films. But this one so engaged high, low and middle learners and everyone developed an A game to bring to the discussion and essay on the topic of Freedom Rides.  It was a lesson to me in how the content impacts the product teachers get from students.  I have immigrants, native born, every ethnicity you could imagine - almost - and everyone was moved, inspired, and mobilized to recognize and speak out against not just racism but sexism, homophobia, and 'immigrantism' (ok - don't think that is a word, but you know what I mean,).

Sweet Honey in the Rock have a song - We Who Believe in Freedom Cannot Rest.  That's why we need to see this movie.",1434153600,2,806,4.3533333333333335

4310744,5,B004AR4VRW,"I dislike people being labeled, however I will identify myself as a WASP just so you know my background.  Having grown up in what was then an all-white Unicoi County, TN, I had never had a social relationship with a person of color until I was serving my mandatory military obligation.  What an eye opener that was--to discover that my fellow soldiers were pretty much the same, regardless of the color of their skin or their religious beliefs/non-beliefs.  By the time I got back to the USA, a black man had become one of my dearest friends.  Though settled in places like NH, PA, TX and FL, four of our military unit stayed in touch over the years, until old-age thinned us out until now only I remain.
In the 1980s my black buddie visited me in FL, and I confessed to him that I felt guilt for not having been active during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.  He then told me that he too felt shame for being so wrapped up in raising his family and work that he did not join in that struggle.
My personal feeling is that viewing this movie should become a mandatory part of the American History courses in our public schools, and hopefully in our private schools as well.  We must do our best to educate our youngsters, in order to avoid another such dark time in the history of our beloved United States of America.",1417737600,7,1324,4.383673469387755

4310765,5,B004AR4VRW,"I've shown this movie to my freshmen English students at the college where I teach dozens of times, and it never fails to shock my students, most of whom are young African Americans.  Most of them had no idea who the Freedom Riders were and how much they sacrificed so that these students and their parents could have many of the freedoms they have today.  Most of them had never heard of the characters who were in the movie other than JFK and MLK and they learned some pretty interesting and controversial things about these two men who everyone thinks are perfect.  In this movie, we find out that ""they have feet of clay,"" as the narrator says about MLK, but the same can be said of the early days of JFK.  The bravery of the Riders is astonishing.  The fact that many of them were white is a revelation to many of my students as well, and there is also some humor thrown in so the movie is not deadly serious at all times.  One of the best I've ever seen.",1407628800,3,960,4.247252747252747
4310766,5,B004AR4VRW,"This film is not about race. It is about courage.  The courage to do something very dangerous, to do it for the first time, and to put your life in the hands of those whose fear of you, of your thoughts, makes them frankly crazy. And the courage to do it singing.  The courage it takes for a college girl to tell a Justice Department official to stand back. To tell him matter-of-factly, ""We don't want to see you get hurt. We're trained in non-violence, and you're not."" And: ""Before you start telling me this is dangerous"" -- he had been sent to dissuade the Freedom Riders -- ""I want you to know we all wrote our wills last night.""

What provocative demonstration were they undertaking? RIDING PUBLIC INTERSTATE BUSES.  A simple, even banal right. For this they were beaten, jailed, and sent to Mississippi's notorious Parchman prison. Crammed together and abused, they made of it, as now-Congressman Carl Lewis calls it, ""our university.""

Some were white, and had travelled long distances, obeying an inner pull.

Throughout, they refused to hate. Why let someone else choose your emotions? Sing, as you deny them that power.

They were touched by something hard to describe, but impressively moving. This film is a treasure, but let us not tie it in a ribbon and place it on a shelf.  Let us not file it under ""Civil Rights movement, long ago.""  It models what we need today.",1406764800,7,1381,4.650205761316872
4310767,5,B004AR4VRW,"I showed this to my fifth and sixth grade students as we were studying peace makers and race relations.  I cut out a couple parts after previewing as they were not appropriate for that age. It had a strong effect on them and heightened their awareness.  for me,  I was very interested in this film and learned a lot.  I have a tremendous respect for all those who fought for equal rights, even more so after watching this.  Very well done.

4310771,5,B004AR4VRW,"To view this DVD is to be inspired, but also reminded of the bravery and dedication it took to finally allow African Americans their rightful place in America. I don't know how many of us would have found the courage to take on the morally bankrupt system of segregation. To watch what John Lewis, and other young people like him suffered, to give voice to the cause of true equality,brings to mind the words of Dr. King that  ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it eventually bends toward justice"". The story also serves as a reminder that was gained, must never be surrendered.",1390435200,,587,4.537735849056604

4310774,5,B004AR4VRW,This is a very good educational documentary on segregation in 1961. I was growing up during this period and happy to be learning more about the struggle and its impact on the nation. In my opinion this should be required reading for high school students. The film Freedom Riders is a very worthwhile addition to anyone's DVD collection. Buy it today.,1376092800,,350,4.754098360655738
4310785,5,B004AR4VRW,This is a fantastic video to show in class.  I teach high school history and my students raved about this film.  There are parts that are hard to watch but it's a wonderfully telling story about the struggle against racism and segregation.,1371427200,,239,4.666666666666667
4310786,5,B004AR4VRW,"Saw this on PBS years ago, and it was still great viewing. Remember as a young girl, watching tv news reports about the Freedom Riders. They were a brave lot and now it's a great DVD explaining the why, who and where. This should be in every High school for students to watch and have an understanding about the civil rights struggle. If you like American history and the story of a people to be able to just travel freely across the South, get this Movie and you will have a more real understanding about America. This was a reasonable $ and worth the money. I recommend this. The picture black and white, reflecting the real film taken at the time live and the dangers of those behind the camera's. Sound was good also.",1362441600,,721,4.388059701492537
4310787,5,B004AR4VRW,I have been fascinated by the Freedom Rides for a long time and this doc did a fantastic job of distilling the events into a compelling story.

Get it.,1361664000,,326,4.295081967213115
4310788,4,B004AR4VRW,"I purchased this back in 2010 and I learned a lot about the horrors of the people who went through the Civil Rights Movement. I definitely gained a greater appreciation for all the people who had to go through this period and have to endure daily torments of the ""N"" word multiple times a day. They are much stronger people for what they went through compared with the spoiled people of our current generation.

I am from Generation Y born in 1983, and I am definitely more well rounded and respect the people who went through this period. I respect african americans, but don't like it when some try to play the victim card when things don't go their way in life. These days many african american kids don't appreciate what their grandparents did in the civil rights movement, and basically have a ""the world owes me"" attitude. I see this everyday with the kids at walmart who are spoiled rotten by their overworked parents.",1359849600,,925,4.606060606060606
4310789,5,B004AR4VRW,"Powerful, moving, and engrossing documentary.  One of the best I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. One thing that makes it so good is the interviews of a surprising number of people who were there and are still alive.  Freedom Riders, an ex southern governor, Kennedy administration staff, and media who filmed it.  Just an incredible story.  I thought I already knew civil rights history.  Not so!  Like any great documentary, it educates you and blows you away with things you never knew. This does that, and makes you feel like you're there, with the interviews.  Add to that the suspense of not knowing what happens, like a good movie.  When a documentary has you on edge of your seat, you know its a winner!  An important period in american history that we must never forget. Buy it.",1359072000,,789,4.618705035971223
4310790,5,B004AR4VRW,"I did not realize just how dangerous it was to ride the buses.  They were very brave people and I wondered if I were in their shoes if I would have had the character to make the same choices.  I also think that if kids today saw what it took for them to have ""equal"" rights they might value their education more that pm they do now.  They might not take it for granted like they do now.  They might not throw away their change to further their lives like to do all to often.",1357344000,,474,3.957894736842105

4310799,5,B004AR4VRW,"Over the years, I have heard much about the Freedom Riders - those courageous souls who rode buses in through the American South in 1961 to protest the racial segregation of bus facilities. But I knew little about the riders or the details of their struggle. This marvelous DVD, ""Freedom Riders,"" arrives to fill the gap. Using film from the period as well as recent interviews with people on both sides, the film tells the story of the young black and white men and women who faced down one of the most terrifying and brutal regimes of its day. The frightening mob violence in Montgomery, Alabama, where mobs beat riders with pipes and bats, is highlighted, as is the evening church service where 1500 blacks were imperiled by ugly white mobs throwing rocks and setting off tear gas. The film shows the Kennedys, especially Bobby, alternately discouraging the ride and pressuring the Alabama government to protect them. Interviews with those in power, including former Alabama governor John Patterson suggests that they still have little remorse for their actions 50 years after they occurred. The role of Martin Luther King, Jr., who preached in Montgomery but declined to join the riders, shows some of the complex emotions and strategies at play in that hot summer.

""Freedom Riders"" fills an important historical gap, depicting how the courageous actions of a few hundred dedicated individuals, united by a strategy of non-violence and inspired by a desire for justice, rained hammer blows on the citadel of racism and segregation. Educational and inspirational!",1328659200,4,1567,5.073643410852713

There were many young people who had tremendous vision for the future and the courage to take their conviction seriously with knowledge they may be killed in the process. I think this Country or at least the people of African American descent own Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) a great deal of thanks.  This outstanding Patriot was at all the historical events surrounding the Civil Right struggle in the 1960s, and he is still a fighter today.

There are several people that are still predjudiced and I really hope that they can see that everyone is equal regardless of their skin color.

The courage that each of the participants exhibited brings pride and joy to my heart.  It encourages me not to accept things as they are, but to make my life the way that I want it.

This movie sure woke up a lot of memories!! A good buy for history buffs and for anyone who doesn't believe that things like this ever took place!,1315180800,6,325,4.344262295081967
4310805,5,B004AR4VRW,"I saw ""Freedom Riders"" on PBS and it raised several emotions in me.  Awe, at what an excellent documentary it is. Shame, at the story it told. Tension, because though I had a general idea of ""what happened"" at the beginning of the civil rights movement, I didn't know this specific story.  Where and by who were the Freedom Riders going to be threatened next as they ventured further south?  It could only end badly when law enforcement is complicit in the one-sided violence.

I didn't write a review for ""Freedom Riders"" when I saw it, but I'm compelled to do so now, because I just saw the movie, ""The Help"".  Both films take place in the early 1960's and my mind boggles at the fear, no, terror, on which Jim Crow was based.  Granted, ""The Help"" is fiction, but it tells a riviting, and from what I've read, true-to-life story.

The Freedom Riders had one goal.  Riding buses where blacks and whites sat together on the same bus and where-ever they wanted, and also sat together at the bus stations. And when they got to a town, they tried to eat together at the same restaurants. As they got plenty of attention, it got so the bus was anticipated on arrival. People were lying in wait for them. They were beaten just getting off the bus, much less anything else. It was brutal, including a time when some locals actually tried to burn the riders alive in the bus.

This is a wrenching documentary to watch, but full of such interesting facts that I highly recommend it. What these people went through, all volunteers, took courage that I really don't think I have.

I was young when the Freedom Riders were in the news and did not really understand, as a ""white"" person, what was trying to be accomplished.  Being more informed today, I hold these young people in the highest regard for their courage, commitment and accomplishment in making these United States a better place and more consistent with our founding principles.",1314576000,2,432,4.904109589041096
4310807,5,B004AR4VRW,"People think I am exaggerating when I describe some of the horrible events that occurred during the freedom rides. Police forces were told to stand down and allow these people to be savaged. Buses were set on fire with people inside them. Outrageous ideas and hate speech were openly expressed. You have to see this to get a real sense of how intense a revolution the freedom riders brought with their willingness to die for equality. Sadly, I doubt many US citizens have this kind of guts today.",1313193600,10,496,4.6477272727272725

4310810,5,B004AR4VRW,"I was horrified to see and learn more about that time in history. In 1961 I was only three years old when these courageous Freedom Riders took those bus rides. I cried throughout this film. I don't understand, why people were so ignorant and hateful. But I highly recommend this film, it was a real eye opener to what happened.",1308096000,7,327,4.466666666666667
4310811,5,B004AR4VRW,"If you missed this two-hour documentary that aired on PBS earlier this month as part of the American Experience series, I urge you to catch the DVD version now available. A copy also belongs in every public and school library as this superbly done film covers - and does NOT sugarcoat - this important event. (Be aware that the ""N"" word is not edited out from archival footage, so it might be advisable for parents to share the viewing of it with young children.)

It's hard for me to believe that it was only 50 years ago this month that near-complete segregation still existed in the U.S. Though the Supreme Court decided in the Brown v. Board of Education case that integration was now the law, in much of the South buses and lunch counters were still ""separate"" for ""whites"" and ""coloreds"" . It was in the Spring of 1961 that CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) organized a volunteer group of both black and white individuals to ride together on two separate buses (one Greyhound; the other Trailways) from Washington, DC to New Orleans. The first half of this film concentrates on that ride, melding archival footage (some amazing film!) with new interviews with those involved - most in their 70s now. We hear from the ""Riders"" as well as onlookers like Janie Forsyth McKinney, who was only 12 years old when one of the buses was torched in front of her parents' store. With tears in her eyes, she describes how she tried to help the injured in any way possible.

When the CORE ""ride"" was finally canceled (it was a no-win at that point), the task was taken over by the Nashville Student Movement, which is covered in the later part of the film.

Even if you think you remember what occurred - by reading the newspapers - you will discover new facts by watching the film. The lack of interest in supporting the ""Riders"" and resolving civil rights issues in general by the Kennedy administration is one fact that may surprise you.

It is wonderful that the producers and directors were able to interview so many of the individuals who were there while they are still alive and their memories clear. Now it is documented for future generations to learn from.

This film is a ""MUST SEE"".

4310812,5,B004AR4VRW,"For more than 30 years, I've been a journalist covering cross-cultural issues in America. I've reported from across the U.S. and often, over the years, have reported on the legacy of the civil rights era. With all that background in my own work, I was startled by details, insights, archival photos and fresh interviews collected in this gripping documentary.

The filmmakers' painstaking care in matching archival images with narratives from people who personally recall the events is startling--right down to a desperately needed glass of water placed into the hands of a Freedom Rider gasping from the smoke in her burned-out bus. These are the details that underline the accuracy of this dramatic account of the Freedom Rides--and, accumulated across the two hours of this documentary, they allow our spirits to soar with these young heroes on the buses. This is not Hollywood hype. This is hard-edged journalism documenting their real-life story.

You will be surprised as you watch this film. There are revelations here about the Kennedy brothers' ambivalence toward civil rights and about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s own attitude toward the young activists. The faces will stir you: Hateful faces in high-resolution images will shock you, but the calm determination of the young Freedom Riders themselves will move you in a hopeful way.

There are oceans of video about the civil rights era. As a journalist who has covered many of these enduring issues over the years, I can tell you: This is a must-see film reported in amazing detail.",1305849600,42,1554,5.086274509803921
4310813,5,B004AR4VRW,"It was a pleasure watching Ray Arsenault on the PBS special Freedom Riders. Ray has been working on this subject for years and has a vast knowledge on this era. We must not forget what a struggle it was to get to where we are today. I was at a Tulane seminar on this topic (sometime before Katrina) with a number of the Freedom Riders and was surprised at how few young people were there for this special gathering. I was so satisfied that this historical event is finally getting all the attention it deserves after 50 years. The documentary is a must see.

4310814,5,B004AR4VRW,"As you watch this amazing documentary, you're struck by the shameful chapter of American history that is the Jim Crow era of segregation. The Deep South (Alabama and Mississippi) must have been hellish places for African American people back in those days. The sheer courage of the Freedom Riders, who were African American and Caucasian, who undertook bus journeys into those areas was a sharp contrast to the cowardly whites who beat, burned and cut these young people because of hate.

Every young person should watch this documentary to see the effects that nonviolence and courage can have on evil. Some of the Freedom Riders were in their teens, but they went into this fight willingly and with admirable grace. This is definitely a must-see.",1305676800,6,748,4.984
