2388868,2,B000AGTQ18,"It seemed a little dull and lifeless.  Watchable, but nothing I'd watch again...  should have seen if Netflix had it!!!  : )",1377734400,,124,4.545454545454546
2388869,5,B000AGTQ18,"If you are a Steve Martini fan and enjoy his books then you have to see this movie,  Brian Denahey is awesome. The movie follows the book very closely and the ending is great  I just wish more Martini stories were made into movies.",1368748800,,231,4.2272727272727275
2388870,3,B000AGTQ18,"The movie itself was OK.  I, too, was able to guess who was the killer but still enjoyed it overall and especially Brian Dennehy's performance.

As to the issue raised by another poster regarding closed captions, my DVD is not closed-captioned and ""CC"" is not indicated on the case description.  Amazon does describe it as ""closed-captioned"" and when I submitted a Catalog Update Form to correct this, my suggestion was denied.",1366329600,,427,4.985915492957746
2388871,3,B000AGTQ18,"Though I figured out early in the movie ""who dunnit,"" I still enjoyed watching this mystery unravel. Brian Dennehy almost always makes a good movie. Great actor!",1362700800,,161,5.0
2388872,5,B000AGTQ18,"I am satisfied with this movie.
Shipping was quick and reliable.
Love this movie.
Saw it a long time ago on the TV.
Thank you very much for this deal.",1361145600,,150,4.033333333333333
2388873,4,B000AGTQ18,I have a number of Brian Dennehy films on tape and I can't wait to be able to replace the with DVD's. I have really enjoyed then all.,1302739200,3,133,3.7857142857142856
2388874,3,B000AGTQ18,"I had a very good experience with the purchasing of this movie. Film was packaged neatly and shipped swiftly. Undue Influence was a great movie, packed full of Suspense at every turn. And you will love the ending! There was an unexpected twist. Would recommend this film to everyone I know.",1279152000,,290,4.705882352941177
2388875,5,B000AGTQ18,I am quite pleased with my purchase and I look forward to possible future purchases.,1264896000,,84,4.666666666666667
2388876,3,B000AGTQ18,"A recent widower defends his sister in law who is accused of murdering her ex-husband's trophy wife after a bitter custody dispute. Dennehy is always believable as the hapless lawyer and Patricia Richardson (Home Improvement) portrays the sister in law who doesn't put up much of a defense much to his frustration.

I love character actor Dennehy, who always injects an ""everyman"" vibe to all of his characters. Unfortunately, at a little under three hours, there were lots of twists and turn, but this was too long and too predicatable. I guessed the ""twist"" within in the first half hour, so it was a big letdown.  The Madriani character lives on, but not with Dennehy - he is protrayed by Mr. Big himself, Chris Noth in a sequel from 2001.",1253577600,4,742,4.7
2388877,5,B000AGTQ18,"I am so sorry it has taken so long to leave feed back.
This was sent very prompted and just what was advertised.",1229040000,,112,3.9130434782608696
2388878,1,B000AGTQ18,"I wouldn't know if this film is any good or not because it is NOT closed

captioned though the description says it is.",1196121600,3,118,4.130434782608695
2388879,5,B000AGTQ18,"This movie keep's you guessing from start to finish. There are enough twists and turns along the way and for 3 hours of quality entertainment, this is great value for money. I totally recommend this movie. You will not be dissapointed. And, if you like Brain Dennehy, this will be one of your favourties.",1194393600,10,304,4.648148148148148
2388880,5,B000AGTQ18,The movie keeps you guessing who dunnit until the very end.  It was great.,1184371200,7,74,4.285714285714286
2388881,5,B000AGTQ18,"I have never seen this but I am a huge Whitney fan and I can tell you it is not her TV Special from the early 90s.  That special was called ""THIS IS MY LIFE"".  I would like to know what this is also.
CHECK OUT WHITNEY'S GREATEST HITS... The album is the bomb.  WHitney's voice is stratispheric!  She's a legend!",973900800,4,311,4.049180327868853
8078502,1,B000AGTQ18,"Does not wear well, 22 years on. The final plot outcome was predictable very early (and al the twists along the way were silly red herrings like 80s movies, of which this trails badly in terms of time). Meanwhile all the stereotypes of females, including but not limited to  innocent girl child to devious hottie to bitchy prosecutor to evil, destructive, home-wrecking nympho were trotted out for all to see, by a B- cast.
(And although I like Dennehy, this swashbuckling role was clearly written for  a much younger, less lumpy and paunchy guy.
I do wish Amazon would stop bulking up its Prime list with stuff like this.",1526083200,,622,4.697247706422019
8078503,5,B000AGTQ18,"Love a who-done-it and this one has twist and turns like you would not believe!  Brian, Jean, and Patricia were at their best.  I like Jean better as a blonde but she was lovely as a red-head.",1525478400,,192,4.162162162162162
8078504,3,B000AGTQ18,"One cliche after another but a good TV who done it if you are too tired to follow a film that has a lot of new
story lines. In fact it was fun to count off the cliches.",1524960000,,168,3.4473684210526314
8078505,3,B000AGTQ18,"It could have been better.  The plot was ok and kept you guessing, if at times it was too coincidental.  But, sorry to say, as good as Brian Denehy was as an actor, he was at least 50 pounds too heavy for this role.  Madriani is the hero, the romantic hero, and it's hard to watch someone as fat as Denehy as the romantic hero.  Before you all start screeching, picture the opposite:  Jean Smart 50 lbs heavier and Denehy as a thin (and younger) hero.  Never would have been cast like that, never, ever.  Also the character of Harry was one big cartoon, from the dyed black hair, his silly clothes and the huge cigar which overpowered his face, to say nothing of the shareless overacting.  Last comment:  Lousy music.",1524960000,,717,4.412213740458015
8078506,2,B000AGTQ18,Audio/video not synchronised.  Bummer because it would have been great from the 5 minutes I was able to sit thru.,1524268800,,113,4.65
8078507,2,B000AGTQ18,"would have made this movie more compelling. I like and respect Brian Dennehy's work, but I think he was miscast here.",1524009600,,117,4.619047619047619
8078508,3,B000AGTQ18,"I like Brian Dennehy and so I watched this entire movie.  It was pretty obvious about 15 mins. in who killed the second wife.  Overall, the acting was just terrible but then the dialogue was not much for them to work with.  Brian should not be doing scenes requiring running - it is obvious he is having hip and/or knee problems.  But I love the guy's presence on the screen - he projects decency, protectiveness and reliability.  The little girl did the best acting.",1523491200,,467,4.511904761904762
8078509,5,B000AGTQ18,I couldn't find this movie anywhere and I finally did! My mom looooooves this movie. I just wish I could find the others like this starring Brian Dennehy that were made for TV. The ones my mom loved were never put on DVD.,1505865600,,221,4.162790697674419
8078510,4,B000AGTQ18,"Nothing wrong with it except, because I am hard of hearing, I am disappointed that there is no CC or subtitles.",1494806400,,111,4.333333333333333
8078511,5,B000AGTQ18,Good movie,1475280000,,10,4.5
