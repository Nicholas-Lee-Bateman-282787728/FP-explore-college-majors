It raises the expectations for even B-level Zombie movies.

5058418,3,B0076VJ2V4,"The 3D effects were pretty good. I am a huge Zombie fan and I knew Jeff Combs before his movie career took off. I was disappointed with the storyline as well as the acting, but it's worth watching if ur a die-hard fan like me :)",1349654400,3,228,3.9782608695652173
5058419,4,B0076VJ2V4,"Note: I said the best 3D zombie film. Not even close to the best zombie flick but with the 3D it is a very fun watch. I really thought they dropped the ball with day of the dead 3D in a lot of cases but have done a much better one with this movie. This is a prelude to the night of the living dead 3D DVD movie starring Sid Haig.(which i didn't think was too bad at all and hope to see that get a 3d blu ray release at some point)

I won't lie there is some light ghosting here and there in the movie but nothing like day of the dead 3D and most of the time you really don't even notice. lots of guns and zombie hands coming out of the screen for some 80's 3D  horror fun!!! ( which i am a nut for!!! I am also talking to you Friday the 13th 3D)

Some really funny sceneshelp bring out the fun cheese factor that any true horror fan i think will apprechate. Plus as one reviewer said you have the wish master and the re-animator fighting off zombies!!!! Whats not to like about that?!!!! okay maybe i went a bit over board with that last part but if you are a 3D horror fan like I am you will more then likely love this little gem as much as I do.",1346284800,3,1147,3.831223628691983
5058420,3,B0076VJ2V4,"The movie wasn't bad, per se.  It was worth seeing ol' Jeffrey ""Herbert West"" Combs back in action in a zombie movie, (though, of course he wasn't *playing* Herbert West!)  All around, the 3-D was *decent* with the rod, the shovel, the couple up-close zombie scenes, and the graveyard.  However, it was a long, drawn-out film that had very slow pacing.  It's meant to be a prequel to the 2006 ""Night of the Living Dead"", but the end had me totally confused and left me saying, ""Yes... but what of it?""

All-in-all, it was ok.  I've seen a LOT worse in the genre.  Go ahead and take the chance, even if it's just for the 3-D Blu-Ray effect.  That alone made the movie for me.  Another reviewer was stating that the film had stills and utilized sock puppets... I have NO idea where they got that idea from!  This particular movie had much the same effects as many other post-modern-day zombie movies. (Think ""Walking Dead"" type effects with CG blood trails when zombies are shot in the head.)  It's a basic B-Class horror film, hands down.  No complaints, but nothing to write home about.  Worth the $20.  Thing is, this movie above is PAL format, so if your player doesn't play PAL, do NOT order!  Our PS3 played it fine however.",1345593600,2,1228,4.493212669683258

The two stars, Divoff and Combs from the Re-Animator movies, are worth the price of admission.  The actress from the Asylum movies, Sarah Lieving is also really good in this too.  She's been good in mostly bad movies up until about now and this flick shows just how good she can be.  As zombie movies go, this one's a little weird.  But at least it's different.  Just read on the official Facebook that it may get a limited release in theaters.  I'd pay to see it up on the big screen in 3-D.  4 out of 5 stars.",1335312000,4,657,4.225806451612903

A good 90% of this is not even a motion picture but still drawings which look like a pre-schooler drew. Then they have the audacity to use clay motion that makes Mr. Bill look like break through technology!! Simply horrible!! Sock puppets were even used at some points!!

5058423,2,B0076VJ2V4,"Ok ,  I for one love campy zombie horror movies but,  this one is a sad attempt at a remake.  Worst ever acting, staging, cinema-photography and script. Several shots (actually many) are computer generated that do not need to be. So I am wondering, is this bad editing or did the crew re-film stuff after the production.  Zombie reanimation from chemical laden body bags are now reanimating the recently and not so recently departed.  The main character has stored bodies that were due for cremation ""the oven"" in a room, (computer generated scene room???) at his mortuary and now they are reanimating, some took a long long time and some come back sooner and slower. This story was just not even good for a campy movie,  all I can say is viewer beware.  But if you are a true zombie fan, then it is a must see,.... Let me know what you think when you do get to see this one....",1331769600,6,878,4.416149068322981

5058429,4,B0076VJ2V4,"So, first off, I love campy zombie movies and consume as much as I possibly can. I'll watch anything, I don't care how bad. But my true loves are definitely the original romero trilogy, especially Day of the Dead.

But I think maybe the movie I enjoy watching most is the 90s remake of Night of the Living Dead.

Now, this movie is pretty goofy, for sure. The effects aren't great. But there's just *something* about it. It centers around this one man's attempts to cover up his mistakes. Andrew Divoff is just awesome. I love it. No one around him acts very well, but he's really good. I dunno, there's just something about this movie.

It's slow, but it's freaky and it builds. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because there are just way better movies out there. But once you've seen all of those, give this a watch.",1414540800,2,828,4.363636363636363

Watched on an on demand service and it was simply horrible. I give it one star for the 10% of the movie that had zombies and gore effects. They were pretty good. But the acting, plot (more like plodding) and questionable storyline were terrible. It's kinda like what you would get if you put a Sarah Palin look-alike, several zombie tea party people (they called them tea baggers in the movie), pot smoking crematory workers, a clueless policeman, an evil mortician in a blender and blend without the top on and see if anything sticks to the wall.

I'm sure there are more, but I had to stop halfway through the movie.  I'm no fan of Sarah Palin or the Tea Party movement, but the social commentary in this movie was truly dull and not amusing.

It was not what I expected. the suprise was the mortician. I got a kick out of how he played the role.
They cheated a bit using notld in the title. Still I got a mild kick and a few laughs from it. I did not expect a lot. All I ask is to be entertained and I was mildly entertained.
If you like a little cheese and have some twists in your sense of humor you may find a little fun here. I often like the odd in movies.

5058437,1,B0076VJ2V4,"I like Jeffrey Combs and, to a lesser extent, Andrew Divoff. This film had potential but within a few minutes that potential was beaten in the head with a shovel and left to rot. The acting is corny (normally I can handle corny but this thing has more corn than Gatlin Nebraska).  This....movie harkens back to a similar piece of... film called Children of the Living Dead. This movie is a step or two above that one but not by much and that's not saying much. There are some humorous moments and an amusing middle finger to Sarah Palin. The effects are not bad. That's one of the few things it has going for it.

In a nut shell, if you're looking for a captivating story and social commentary like Romeo, skip this one.

If you're looking for a brainless turd that has absolutely nothing to do with NOTLD and is just something goofy to watch and make fun of while you're drunk (I don't recommend viewing this one sober) then give it a go for the stoned zombie getting it on with a mortuary employee on an embalming table.

from him.  No spoilers here.  The gore factor
was ok in the limited zombie actions.  The
zombie effects were good and the CG wasn't
awful.  The scene where our undertaker is shooting
zombies in the furnace room was silly.  The
shotgun has a clip, 1 in the chamber and maybe
3 in the clip.  I lost count after 15 shots

5058443,3,B0076VJ2V4,"Night of the Living Dead: Reanimation (Jeff Broadstreet, 2012)

To put it kindly, Night of the Living Dead: Reanimation has been savaged on the Internet, with just a 3.1 rating on IMDB. I think it suffers from the same disease that pummelled the stupid-yet-oddly-entertaining 2008 Day of the Dead remake--it's not canonical! Which is absolutely true, and I will warn you right now I'm about to give Jeff Broadstreet a pass on something I castigated George Romero for in Land of the Dead (and I'm giving Broadstreet a pass because this isn't a canonical film in the NotLD universe). But let's face it: given the average quality of the canonical films that have come out in the past ten years, culminating in the loathsome Survival of the Dead, well, I'm really starting to prefer the movies not made by George A. Romero. And this one's got something truly special, albeit in the cheesiest of ways: it's Wishmaster's Andrew Divoff squaring off against Re-Animator's Jeffrey Combs. You're talking about a recipe for cheesy greatness here! And while I will be the first to tell you this is a low-budget (despite the 3Dand I should note for the record I saw it in 2D), amateur, labor-of-love kinda film, it's not even playing in the same city, much less the same zip code, as Survival of the Dead, and it is immensely preferable.

Plot: Gerald Tovar, Jr. (Divoff, taking the role Sid Haig played in the 2006 Night of the Living Dead 3D) is the only funeral director in Hinzmanville, PA. (Yes, that is the level of inside-jokey humor to be found in this movie, and you know what? I loved it.) He works there with his Aunt Lou (Geppetto's Melissa Jo Bailey), aide Dyeanne (The Lost's Robin Sydney), and general handyman/stoner Russell (Redemption's Adam Chambers). Gerald has himself a small problem for a funeral director: he's pyrophobic, and so every time someone has wanted a body cremated since he took over, he's just kind of... stored it. At the same time, he's kept up pappy's old business of taking in medical waste (a government contract, of course!), and he doesn't burn that, either. A couple of weeks ago, they delivered something that, when combined with the corpses, started having nasty side effects. But the zombiesand as a side note, the funeral home is not the only place the zombies are popping up (in fact, we are told in a TV clip the characters are watching that the Vice President of the United States is a zombie!)--are far from Gerald's only worry. His younger brother, veterinarian Harold (Combs), has turned up looking for money. He's not happy with Dyeanne's work, and has just hired recent mortuary school grad Cristie (Lakeview Terrace's Sarah Lieving) to replace her. Some whistleblowers are sniffing around, having got wind of pappy's side business. You know, that sort of thing. Oh, and Russell keeps getting the workers stoned...

Yes, it's stupid. It's gratuitous in at least one scene (Dyeanne, it turns out, seems to be based on Karen Greenlee, which is the only way I can say that without spoilers; wikipedia the name if you want to know more without seeing the film), which paves the way to a scene that rivals the girl-on-girl kiss in Land of the Dead for sheer gratuitousness. But again, this isn't Romero-canon, it's Jeff Broadstreet making a loose sequel to an even looser remake that parts ways completely with canon. So you want to throw in a gratuitous sex scene? Go right aheadI mean, you've already stuck a pot-smoking zombie in less than two minutes previous.

I don't mean to imply this scene is synecdochic of the entire film. It's an anomaly, though not too much of one; there's a lot of stuff that's in here just for laughs, or just for nostalgia purposes (the first TV clip we hear Aunt Lou watching is Chilly Billy's news report towards the end of Romero's '68 classic), that does nothing at all to advance the film's admittedly paper-thin plot. (But come on, save the original Dawn of the Dead, what was the last zombie movie that did have a plot? White Zombie?) When you're making a movie that's basically plotlessand even worse, derivativeyou've got to work on points for style, as David Gilmour once said. And I'm not entirely sure what Jeff Broadstreet was slipping into folks' drinks when he was making this movie, but he managed to coax performances out of these folks I haven't seen in dogs' yearsor ever seen. The last time I remember liking Jeffrey Combs this much was The Frighteners (1996). Divoff? Never been this good. Same can be said for Sydney, though she's been around much less time. If she keeps throwing out performances like this one she's got a very bright future ahead of her. In fact, all the principals here are very good, though some of the minor characters could've used some... okay, a lot of... work. Specifically, Denice Duff, a mainstay of the Subspecies franchise, portrays a Sarah Palin knockoff who never rises above one-dimensional parody. Imagine what Broadstreet could have done with a character like that had he attempted to build in some classic-Romero-era satire. But when Broadstreet is on, he is on. Combs and Divoff's first face-off, when you're not quite sure whether Gerald is going to welcome him back into the family? That's very good stuff, right there. If the rest of the film had been of that quality, we would have had a minor gem on our hands. Instead, we got a watchable movie with a number of missed opportunities, a number of surprising performances, and a lot of, in my estimation, undeserved brickbats being tossed at it from all comers. ** ",1362960000,,5548,4.775

It's not a action zombie flick though, it's more character driven and too many people today want endless zombie kills and no plot. You get plot here and acting and some zombies.

5058450,5,B0076VJ2V4,"Gerald (Andrew Divoff ) is a deadpan undertaker. It seems his mortuary has a re-animation issue which we don't see start, but from the beginning we get the suspicion Gerald knows something. His employees include the well endowed Dyeann (Robin Sydney) a goth who describes herself as a ""necro."" There is young Russel (Adam Chambers) the handyman. Melissa Jo Bailey plays the snarky secretary, and Jeffrey Combs plays Harold, a conspiracy buff brother who has returned for some money. He reminded me of a young Dabney Coleman.

The movie returns to some zombie basics. In this feature the culprit is army chemical waste as this film sets up to be a sister film of the ""Return of the Living Dead"" series. The zombie effects were good. I liked the maggots, a feature rarely used outside of 80's Italian Zombie productions. The zombie metaphor is brought into the realm with references to former VP Cheney being a zombie. There are negative references to the Tea Party (T-baggers), The Drudge (Grudge) Report, Fox (Fixd) News and Sarah Palin (sister Sara) who is played by a you betcha Denice Duff down to the red jacket stolen from Admiral Kirk. Later she will crave brains. There is political satire at work, an aspect which might make the film more or less enjoyable depending on one's leanings.

I also liked some of the background stuff such as Dyeann watching ""White Zombie"" and the picture of Lenin in daddy's office. I had to laugh out loud when I saw the air fresheners. There is a humorous aspect to this film too. The film lacked the heavy human vs. zombie action which has spoiled us. Most of the action takes place on only a few sets and you never expected it to expand, especially with things relatively under control. The film sets up for an interesting sequel.

C'mon Combs n Crampton.....I'm not getting any younger and neither are you both.  Barbara more nudity.  Oh, the movie?, It was not memorable.",1529971200,,312,4.923076923076923
8511168,2,B0076VJ2V4,"The movie started out promising, showing a bit of zombie action within the first few minutes, but then, except for a few gory special effects, there's nothing but dialogue until the last 25 minutes or so. As a remake / parallel to the Sid Haig version I found it to be fairly enjoyable overall, mainly because of the performances of the two main cast members, Gerald Tovar, played by Andrew Divoff, and half-brother Harold, played by Jeffrey Combs, who I most fondly remember as Weyoun from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Oddly enough, in this performance, Combs looks more than a bit like Dabney Coleman as Otis Drexell.

As good as the main cast performance is though, and as nice as it is to see Combs in just about anything, the film is just too talkative.

Additionally, if you're one of the people bothered by such things, the blatant political commentary kills the mood somewhat, especially when you consider that it's played for comedy, and the movie can't seem to decide whether it wants to be scary or funny.

I'd say, if you're a fan of the actors involved, or you consider yourself a zombie completionist, then this is worth watching at least once, but probably not more than that.",1524960000,2,1190,4.6571428571428575

The ""Acting"" could have been done by a kindergarten drama group, and been done better. There really is no point to this unless you are really REALLY drunk. I made the mistake of Buying it on DVD.

8511174,5,B0076VJ2V4,"Andrew Divoff wonderfully plays the role of a man whose life pretty much starts to unravel shortly after his father dies, and he inherits a decrepit old house and a funeral home full of odd characters and very strange happenings. Enter Jeffrey Combs, who plays the younger brother. He's come home, looking for his part of the inheritance. Amazing actor, great part. This movie was actually funnier than I expected. It was a fun, creepy little film that makes you sad when it ends. Watch for the little car air freshener trees and what they're used for. Hilarious. As an added plus, there's a gag reel and some behind the scenes footage and interviews with Andrew Divoff.",1487635200,2,670,4.735042735042735
