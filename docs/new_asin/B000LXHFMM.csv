2716981,4,B000LXHFMM,"What a quirky movie yet there was something compelling about it that made me keep watching.  The perpetually overcast scenery and the not frigid but still chilly weather threw a blanket of menace over everything.  As much as I hate watching movies with subtitles I couldn't get myself to stop watching.  Even though I'd read the blurb about the movie on IFC I still kept waiting for a logical explanation for the main character's suffering OTHER than possession.  I KNOW!  What a Hollywood theme right?  But the Germans made a very non-Hollywood film.  It's quiet and understated.  There aren't any bizarre special effects with blood spurting everywhere.  Conversations are quiet, subdued even when the devil is speaking.  LOL  I have no idea if the actors are well known in Germany but none of them were even vaguely familiar looking to me which also added to the feeling of realness about this movie.  The ending caught me off guard although it probably shouldn't have.",1239580800,4,971,4.889570552147239
2716982,2,B000LXHFMM,"Although the actors' portrayals in this film were well done, the film itself failed to strike a chord in me entirely. I believe that the actual topic of the film was tip-toed around as it took too long to get to the actual story. There was too much socializing and partying going on which abaded the true topic. The ending was extremely poor as it simply states the official outcome of the film's premise rather than take you through the meat of the process which is what would've been the real point to the film. If you really want to see this film I would not recommend purchasing it but rather renting it, if possible. Good day! :)",1233878400,6,634,4.38135593220339
2716983,3,B000LXHFMM,"""Requiem"" is a drama, not a horror film.  Both the illustration on the cover of the DVD and the price of the movie itself are misleading.  This is not very frightening and does not warrant the amount of money one has to pay for it.

That said, as a psychological drama of the most disturbing kind, it works well.  Sandra Huller gives an amazing, understated performance as  Michaela Klingler (aka Anneliese Michel), a German college student with a history of epilepsy and other psychological problems who makes a bid for fulfilling her potential by going away to college at the age of 21.  Her family is ultra-Catholic (the director has lots of fun pointing his finger at this for her horrid fate, as any mainstream independent filmmaker must for the sake of political correctness), and her mother is a cold, repressed woman who generally disapproves of everything she does.

Burghart Klaubner gives a touching performance as the girl's warm and supportive father, who only wants to see his daughter succeed rather than suffer. He covers for her when she has spontaneous fits or acts strangely for the sake of her overall happiness.  He does everything he can to keep her from the snares of her mother's iron grip.  Ultimately, however, all of this fails.

Anna Blomeier plays Hanna Imhof, another college student who attended high school with Michaela.  Another supportive figure, she slowly watches her friend descend into the worst kind of madness: refusal to eat, hallucinations (are they?) of demonic influeneces preventing her from prayer, etc.  One might say she is the ""secular hero"".

Both priests as portrayed, of course, as misguided and generally unhelpful, though the elder of the two tells Micheala appropriately to see a psychologist right away.  Here the film becomes a bit confusing, as though Schmidt couldn't decide what he wanted to say, though it becomes more clear at the end: she is taking her medicine for epilepsy, but she is still not getting better.  The slightest things cause her horrible anxiety and she is unable to touch a crucifix.  In one one scene, when is attempting to pray, a rosary spontaneously falls from the table.  What is that supposed to mean?  Every scene suggests that she is mentally disturbed and nothing more up till then.

This is difficult to watch and makes one reflect on the general cruelty of Anneliese Michel's fate, possessed or insane.  We see different viewpoints from different characters, but in her last conversation with Hanna, the makers of the film seem to be implying that Anneliese was a girl who was narcissistic and disturbed, and wanted to ""go out in style"" (by starving herself to death, eating bugs, inflicting wounds, etc?) like
the saint she idolized, who died a martyr. In other words, she wanted to die and life was too much on her, but she wanted to be special in a spiritual way.  If I were one of the parents of Anneliese Michel I would find that very disrespectful.  Though the director makes his case well I doubt that was the case.

Also, the film just sort of ends without showing the exorcism or anythinf of the kind. I couldn't believe it.  This is most certainly worth watching for the amalgam of possibilities it presents, but I would get it used and be aware that this is not a horror movie, but minimalist psychological drama.",1212883200,12,3316,4.818021201413427
2716984,4,B000LXHFMM,"I watched this movie on the IFC tv station.

I didn't realize until reading some of the other reviews that this is the true story behind 'The Exorcism Of Emily Rose'.

Emily Rose was much more frightening to be sure and completely different from this movie.

In this movie it's hard to determine if this unfortunate young woman is even possessed or if she is only suffering from some sort of illness.

Based on what they showed this case would not pass the strict rules that the Catholic Church has to determine if demonic possession has occurred.

However I gave it four stars since you become endeared to this girl.  It's set in Germany and you definitely get the feeling of a simpler place and time.

It's a sad story because she has the same hopes and dreams that most people have but this issue with her mind interferes with everything.  As it attacks her more and more she cannot function normally in society, make friends, continue with college, etc..

As it is even when it's not attacking her you get the feeling that she is never quite normal at any time.

The movie starts to take a sort of disturbing and unenjoyable turn towards the end as she becomes more and more disfunctional, sort of like someone with Alzheimer's disease or something like that.  Just typing a school paper becomes almost a life and death type issue.

The ending is sort of a let down and anti climatic.

It's a sad story.

2716985,4,B000LXHFMM,"Requiem (Hans-Christian Schmid, 2006)

The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Scott Derrickson's 2005 reimagining of Felicitas Goodman's nonfiction book on the Anneliese Michel possession case, is one of the best American horror films of the past decade, and arguably the best from a major studio. The source material, however, by virtue of the case itself, belongs to the Germans. It's no surprise that German director Hans-Christian Schmid (Crazy, It's a Jungle Out There) and first-time feature writer Bernd Lange crafted what can be seen as an answer to Emily Rose with Requiem, a decidedly different take on the Michel case, but one that is just as effective in its treatment.

The story concerns Michaela Klingler (stage actress Sandra Huller, in only her second big-screen appearance), a college student on her way to becoming a teacher. Vague references are made early on to bad events that occurred in her past, but the first glimpse we get that something is amiss comes when we see what appears to be a minor seizure. We get more vague mentions of what happened in the past, and a lot of short scenes of Michaela taking her prescription anti-seizure medication. Michaela, it comes out, is convinced that she is being assaulted by evil spirits. Those around her have very different opinions as to the accuracy of her beliefs. The priest who serves her parish is convinced she has a mental problem, while the guy he replaced is intrigued with the idea that Michaela may be possessed. Her mother, deeply and conservatively religious, is of the opinion that the only ""evil spirits"" involved are those any college girl is exposed to when away from home. Her father just wants his daughter to get better, and doesn't care what the reasons are, as long as they can be fixed. Her best friend, the aggressively atheist Hanna (Anna Blomeier), thinks Michaela's religious upbringing is to blame. And the boyfriend-- who knows what he thinks? Everyone's keeping him in the dark.

If it sounds like a farce, that is because, in part, it is-- albeit a deadly serious one. There were never any solid answers in the Anneliese Michel case, and Schmid and Derrickson take very differing approaches to their source material. In a sense, the two movies are of a piece, as The Exorcism of Emily Rose picks up almost precisely as Requiem ends-- with the exception of one half-hearted attempt at talking to the ""demons"", Requiem shows nothing of Michaela's final days. I say this not as a spoiler, but as a way of dissuading those who continue to refer to this as a horror film. It is nothing of the sort. This is a drama, or more accurately a character sketch; it's not about the exorcism, it's about Michaela Klingler (or, more accurately, Anneliese Michel). Without spoiling either movie, it's safe to say that both want you to take away a different idea of what actually happened in the case (and, interestingly, both takes on it are different than the conclusions reached in Goodman's book on the case, which makes experiencing all three interpretations in a relatively short period of time feel not in the least repetitious); either is plausible, depending on your beliefs.

Differences or no, the strengths of both movies lie in the same place, and depend on the same thing-- their lead actress. Where Jennifer Carpenter's strength lay in the dramatic difference between Emily Rose the vivacious college student and Emily Rose the demon-possessed monster, Sandra Huller's lies in showing how we get from point A to point B. No matter what happened to the woman, what captures the viewer in this case is the sense of loss of self that Michaela Klingler suffers over the three or four months spanned by the film. That's why, both in this case and that of Emily Rose, what the director and screenwriter want you to believe about the Anneliese Michel case is ultimately irrelevant. What's important, what's compelling, is the universal themes raised-- the smothered child suddenly thrust into the big, wide world, and the anxiety issues that are bound to follow.

What really happened to Anneliese Michel? We will never know; the only person who can tell us has been dead for over two decades. We, living in the twenty-first century, have been remarkably fortunate to have people speculating on that question who are capable of offering up such compelling thoughts on it. ****",1199318400,23,4355,4.8956639566395665
2716986,4,B000LXHFMM,"This film is probably the closest to the truth any film maker will come to telling the story of Anneliese Michel, the girl that also ""inspired"" the more sensationalist production of Exorcism of Emily Rose.

You're not going to find paranormal phenomena, gore and chilling hallucinations in this movie. Instead you'll see rock solid performances about a poor girl who had epilepsy and most likely dissociative personality disorder with psychotic episodes. Who's parents and town priests chose to treat her with a 10 month long excorcsim rather than continue further treatment attempts by psychiatrists.

I'd like to point out that the cover art and advertising for this film is completely misleading, much to my surprise as the distributor is IFC Films. For decades now, American distributors choose to advertise foreign productions in a way where they appeal to the stupidest of all audiences. In this case, Requiem is sold as a hack horror flic that rides the success wave of ""Emily Rose""...which it isn't at all. Shame on IFC.",1197158400,11,1028,5.076923076923077

2717030,3,B000LXHFMM,"ve got to say that I marveled over Sandra Hllers performance, its absolutely astonishing! The young lady is talented beyond belief. If she had been an american rather than German and this film was an american production rather than a german one, chances are she would have easily walked away with an oscar for the sheer beauty of her acting. She plays a girl torn to tatters with a strange type of epilepsy that some believe can be cured with medication, while others including she her self, believe she is possessed by a demon. Based on a true story this film leaves one wondering if her condition was indeed caused by epilepsy or if she was in fact suffering from demon possession. One may never know. As her illness progresses she can no longer hold a rosery in her hand. Then later on she cannot touch a crucifix. Then even further on she cries out in mortal terror in the presence of prayer. She hears voices, and begins to worsen until she is totally in the depths of madness. This actress won me over with one of the most electrifying performances I have seen in ages.

2717034,4,B000LXHFMM,"Requiem is a drama film based on demonic possession and epilepsy. Don't be fooled though, this film is not a horror movie like most popular possession films. Requiem works very well as a drama.

What did I like? The film is very immersive, in my opinion. I was very interested in the events and how the movie would play out; would it lead to a scientific or religious explanation? Sandra Hller gives a great performance as Michaela Klingler. No need to modify her voice or throw cuts on her to make her performance effective. I definitely enjoyed the realistic route the film took instead of going over-the-top, like some recent possession films. It's a very well-made drama.

What did I dislike? The pacing was a little off and I actually would of liked a little more detail; for example, I would've enjoyed a more detailed doctor visit explaining what they believed her sickness was.

Overall, I highly recommend Requiem as long as you make sure you know this is NOT a horror film. It can get disturbing and creepy at times, but it's not meant to be a straight horror film. As of 7/18/12, Requiem is available on Netflix Streaming if you're still unsure and would like to save some money.

2717036,5,B000LXHFMM,"Schmid's Requiem is a sober case study of the effect of freedom on a pill-taking epileptic who hears voices as she tries to move outside of her deeply religious family's restrictive upbringing. She tries to cope at university, for the first time outside the narrow world that she knew,making new friends of both sexes. Michaela reaches out for saints,crosses and prayer rather than psychiatry, as she has her seizures. Her family, priests and friends restrict her choice of solutions to those of exorcism or prayer and 'home treatment'.The actress playing the central role of Michaela(Sandra Huller), conveys the religious-epileptic ambiguity very well. This film was so free of the sensationalism of the Emily Rose variety,even the death happens in the subtitles, that I thanked the greater subtlety of European cinema for this called-for treatment.

The question of possession is left open,it is not ruled out. She believes she is possessed but the director films with a clear mind the alternative theories of what is going on. The conflict between her parents,her father's closeness set against her mother's controlling nature,her epilepsy,her religiosity,leave her with limited interpretations of her experience. The lead performance was superb,coming as she does from stage acting. Again, German cinema,with films like this,Sophie Scholl,The Edukators,The Lives of Others,The Nasty Girl,Downfall and The Baader-Meinhoff Complex,is forging ahead,showing European cinema with a fine conscience what it can do. I recommend
this film like a doctor recommends you take your medicine!",1277164800,4,1583,5.595833333333333
2717037,4,B000LXHFMM,"REQUIEM retells the haunting story of Anneliese Michel (changed to Michaela for the film) , a young college student plagued by 'demonic' forces that caused her both physical and mental harm before a rogue exorcism lead to her death in July of 1976. The story had been popularized a year earlier in THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE, but where EXORCISM seemed to promote the idea that Anneliese was, in fact, possessed, REQUIEM takes a much less theatrical approach in depicting the events from a psychological standpoint. Michaela's spastic behavior and horrified reactions to her visions are the only clues the audience is given as to the hidden terrors that she is experiencing. The documentary-style filming gives the viewer intimate access to the events as they occur, drawing additional sympathy from those watching as they are faced with the deteriorating effect Michaela's condition has on her sanity and those around her. What many will find to be the most disappointing aspect of the film is that it ends at what would be the story's climax (that being the series of exorcisms that resulted in her death). This choice was presumably made to allow the viewer the chance to decide whether or not Michaela was possessed for themselves, but how she may have acted during these missing sequences may have had a profound impact on the viewer's final opinion. REQUIEM remains a competent character study that approaches the subject from a subtle and unique angle.

2717038,4,B000LXHFMM,"There has been quite a good number of movies that have been inspired by the life a German- Catholic young woman named Anneliese Michel, who was believed to have been possessed by 6 or more demonic entities. More or less, folks are very familiar with Scott Derrickson`s ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" which may be the most popular one due to Hollywood`s marketing ability. Another film that depict her life is ""Exorcism: the Possession of Gail Bowers"" which I haven't seen yet. ""REQUIEM"" however, has been billed as the most accurate and truthful depiction of the events in Anneliese Michel's experience with exorcism and bouts with epilepsy. The film is directed by German director Hans-Christian Schmid and presents a dramatic approach of the true events rather than approaching them with the trappings of a horror movie. The names have been changed to protect the persons involved.

Germany in the late 1970's. Michaela Klingsler (played by Sandra Huller) is young devout Catholic woman who suffers from Epilepsy who is determined to get a college degree regardless of her condition. She sees education as a form of an `escape"" away from her family's overly religious ways and traditional beliefs. She shows great potential in becoming a scholar and with a very timid support from her father (Burghart Klausner), she begins to excel in her studies. She also tries to build relationships while fighting a feeling of loneliness and sexual awakening. Several months after Michaela becomes a college student and she begins to experience strange things within her psyche; Michaela begins to hear voices, she begins to see things no one else could and what is more disturbing is that she has begun to be repulsed by religious objects, prayers and priests. Science says that she has a mental sickness but Michaela believes that she is being possessed by a demon. What is real or what is a hallucination? Michaela wants to subject herself to the rites of exorcism which may prove to be more than she had bargained for...

Hans-Christian Schmidt's ""Requiem"" unfolds more like a character-driven dramatization rather than a horror movie. Instead of following the usual horror movie trappings and diverting to fantastical recreations of demons spewing out goo-ish stuff , jumping out and screaming obscenities; ""Requiem"" is a docile film that keeps its tone quite low-key and very subtle. If you are expecting a movie with lots of scary images, gruesome make up, and strong dialogue then you may be a little disappointed and you should see ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" instead. However, if you are curious as who or what is the real Anneliese Michel then this movie will not disappoint.

A lot of the film's theme lies on the fabric of Michaela's potential insanity and a war of divine faith. Much of the lead character's belief lies on the fact that medicine cannot remedy her suffering and that relief may be found in the comfort of God's hand and the priests who try to aid in easing her suffering. The film's script manage to raise questions about faith, religious belief and medical science without becoming preachy and passing judgment. Her experiences present a question between the three notions of possession, epilepsy and mental imbalance, the director wisely asks the right questions and brings forth an area for bafflement.

""Requiem"" takes a more focused approach on its humanism rather than subjecting the audience to elaborate `jump' scares and tricks with imagery. The script shows that Michaela is suffering, we witness her becoming more and more sickly, upset and towards the end, she becomes a more malevolent. The atmosphere gives off an aura that the film is a factual event and most of the demonic haunting is exhibited with Michaela's reactions and not on violent imagery. The screenplay also draws out the characters of Michaela's parents that gives them a feeling of helplessness; they are torn on what they have to do. Even the priests are given a somewhat of a contrasting characterization as one is able to embrace the possibility of a demonic possession as presented by father Martin (Jens Hurzor) and one who may be terrified to the point of denial in father Gerhard's persona (Walter Schmilinger). The film takes on a more relaxed approach and keeps its focus on Michaela and the situation that torments her. It is none the less unnerving as we see her deteriorating state of being.

I know it is difficult to portray a film supposedly full of factual events but director Schmid adapts the material very well; it also helps when the lead actress is as talented as Sandra Huller. Huller plays her role very well, with a restrained craft that will still bring some chills in your spine. Michaela believes she is being oppressed by evil spirits and the actress does a terrific job with the script. Huller would only do this when the she sees fit, after all, an oppressed-possessed individual would try to hide this fact as much as they could until it spirals out of their control. Huller plays her character with this understanding which makes it very powerful. Michaela is given a depth based on a controlled, awesome, innumerable mixture of emotions and sensations. It also brings questions as to what provoked the experiences; sexual awakening and modernization, stress from college, not taking her medicine or maybe all of the above?

""Requiem"" is a film stripped down and is raw from any easy resolution to the questions. I liked the idea that the direction sidestepped the trappings of a horror movie but instead manages to bring the characters out in a compelling dramatization. Instead of invoking fear from stylized special effects and dumb jump scares, the film brings a persuasive feeling of dread by bringing forth its humanity. It makes one wonder if Michaela is indeed insane or just sick with epilepsy...or is it indeed ethereal? The doctor who tended to the real Anneliese Michel was recorded as saying: ""there is no injection against the devil, Anneliese"".

Director Schmid manages to ask the right questions without spoon-feeding his own conclusions to his viewers. It is easily one of the best films that have tackled the subject matter of demonic possession and exorcism. ""Requiem"" feels very authentic to a truthful story and there is nothing more unnerving than a horror movie based on factual events. The performance of Huller (who won best actress for this film) is worth the price of the dvd; she brings you straight into the psyche of Michaela that is very creepy but at the same time, so honest and sincere in simplicity. ""Requiem"" is a tumultuous journey with a young woman who just wants to live her life, stay true to her beliefs...demons or not.

Highly Recommended! [4+ Stars]",1255737600,7,6725,4.955673758865248

By contrast, in the movie ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"", the character was well respected in its purity, and scenes of terror are horripiantes. In both films, the performances are good. Returning to ""Requiem"", this film does a very good ambience in the early 70s. Finally, ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" is best film, and ""Requiem"" I recommend less.",1411689600,,1063,4.7771739130434785

In this movie, you don't know for sure whether it is spiritual, psychological or demonic.  The outcome is the same, but we have no priests on trial, here.  This is about a real woman with a debilitating disease and how fear and ignorance can literally destroy a person's life.",1381708800,2,371,4.857142857142857
