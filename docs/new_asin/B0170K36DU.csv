Great makeup effects, funny characters, and very entertaining horror comedy. Hope to see more of Mr. Crippleton in the future. This is good redneck fun! 5/5",1465948800,2,268,4.723404255319149

Great horror satire, a great party flick, and worth it's weight in moonshine...  Highly recommended for the B-Movie horror fan in all of us.",1449792000,2,393,4.571428571428571
8737743,3,B0170K36DU,"Man oh man! What can I say? Without revealing what it is,... the opening scene of this movie IMMEDIATELY grabbed my attention and I couldn't tear myself away until the picture was finished. If nothing else I HAD to watch and see just HOW the outcome would turn out. Modern times with zombies taking over the film/TV industry this movie fits right in... and more. We can ALL use a little Hans for our troubled times. Now I have to hold myself down and wait for the sequel(s). Grab the popcorn and the mixed drinks and watch it. This one is destined to be a cult classic! Now where did I put my chainsaw? ... and my Jack Daniels?",1448064000,2,627,4.277310924369748
8737744,4,B0170K36DU,"I got to see the screener of this movie and I laughed, quite out loud, several times.  Below is the review I wrote for IMDB.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Hans Crippleton, in this viewers opinion, is the logical extreme of any ""reality"" TV show. It is no more silly than Ghost Hunter and the Real Wives of Wherever rolled into one. We as the viewers are essentially treated to an episode of Horror Hunts with Barnaby Hunt, played by Andy Hankins. The ""show"" follows the life of Hans Crippleton, played disturbing well by Kevon Ward, and his inbred family and their lives living on a rundown farm.

We are immediately greeted with a seriously ""holy Toledo!"" moment near the beginning of the film when learn of Hans' birth in a dirt field as his mother is being chased by zombies. Hans is dragged through a field by his umbilical cord. This scene immediately let's us know exactly why Hans is the way he is and what kind of movie this is going to be.

The Crippleton's are essentially the Kardashians of hilly billy, inbred zombie killers and Hans is the Kim of the family. He is the celeb among celebs of their community.

On a much deeper level, this movie pokes fun at the cliques in the film and acting community. Celebrity and its micro-chasms. Hans makes a ""living"" attending Horror Conventions, where he is regarded as one of the celebs. Even the entire inbred Southerner theme is actually more of an allegory for the incestuous relationships that go on in the movie business as a whole. While the horror movie genre would be the first guess, I tend to think this is shot across the bow at all movies like it. Even when you look at Comic Book conventions, and the stars they now attract you see the same people over and over again, celebrity begetting celebrity. Any Star Trek convention without Jonathan Frakes isn't really a Star Trek convention is it? Any horror convention that isn't ""Hans Approved"" really isn't a horror convention! Hans himself is a reminder of the price of celebrity and how fickle the world can be. It might also be a lesson to not take your 15 minutes too seriously and just enjoy them.

I don't want to put in too many spoilers so I will wrap it up by writing this: Watch this movie with an open mind, and an open mouthed laugh and you will enjoy it. Micro-budget films like this are something that are best approached with levity in your heart. You will find it much more entertaining if you do. If you expect big budget explosion after explosion, scenes doctored to the nth degree, and unlimited re-shoots to make it ""perfect"", than this type of movie is probably not for you.

Jimmy Lee Combs is a welcome addition to the micro-budget film genre, giving us a film that is funny, has layers, doesn't bury its message too deep, but allows us to dive in deep if we want to. Jimmy lets all that is sacred just hang out there like a piata to be beat upon, and like blind-folded little kids, we can run around and laugh and have a good time doing so.",1447372800,4,2992,4.457038391224863
