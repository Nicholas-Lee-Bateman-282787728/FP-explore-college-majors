3616588,5,B001GMS5O4,"This 1945 ""B"" movie, ""Detour"", was produced in a matter of days by a cheap ""poverty row"" Hollywood studio. It is based on a pulp novel of the same name by Martin Goldsmith who also wrote the screenplay. Edgar Ulmer was the director.  After ""Detour's"" release, the film's reputation gradually continued to grow until in 1992 it became the first ""B"" movie selected for the Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically"" significant. ""Detour"" has become a cult classic and books and articles have been written about it, eg&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Detour-BFI-Film-Classics/dp/1844572390/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Detour (BFI Film Classics)</a>. I have become interested in noir, both books and films over the past few years and stumbled on ""Detour"" by chance. Chance and fate are strong themes of the film.

This is a gritty film about thwarted dreams, told as a lengthy flashback with extended hard-boiled voice-overs by the main character Al (Tom Neal).  Al is a piano player in a cheap nightclub who hopes to marry his sweetheart, Sue, (Claudia Drake) who sings at the club.  But Sue leaves for Hollywood in search of a better life. Lonely, Al decides to join her and sells his few possessions to hitchhike to her across the country. A wealthy playboy, Haskell, picks Al up and then drops dead on the road.  Al, fearing he will be accused of murder, hides the body, takes the car, and becomes a haunted fugitive.  His troubles are only beginning as he picks up a young woman, Vera (Ann Savage) who, in another coincidence had also had a ride from Haskell.  She tries to blackmail Al.  Al abandoning his dream of marrying  Sue and finding a happy life, accidentally kills Vera by causing her strangulation with a telephone cord.

The movie is in grainy black and white and is filmed largely on desert roads. The movie builds in tension over its 68 minutes aided by the taut musical score of Leo Eroddy.  Ann Savage delivers an extraordinary performance of the femme fatale, with her sneering lines, hard character, and smoldering, frustrated sexuality. The movie takes the ""road"" theme of much American literature and gives it a dark twist. Instead of becoming a place for freedom and a new start, the road becomes a scene of menace, darkness, fate, and of lost individuals.

Film critic Roger Ebert said of ""Detour"":

This movie from Hollywood's poverty row, shot in six days, filled with technical errors and ham-handed narrative, starring a man who can only pout and a woman who can only sneer, should have faded from sight soon after it was released in 1945. And yet it lives on, haunting and creepy, an embodiment of the guilty soul of film noir. No one who has seen it has easily forgotten it.""
(quote taken from Wiki)

""Detour"" is a must-see for anyone with a serious interest in film noir. The film is in the public domain and readily accessible with a bit of searching.

3616589,5,B001GMS5O4,This film is a monument to director Edgar G Ulmer. It is a masterpiece like so many others he directed. the man was an under appreciated genius.

3616590,4,B001GMS5O4,"A lot of guys, musical guys anyway, are always trying to reach that high white note, that elusive note that says they have made it, have met god and his graces, in their chosen profession.  A few guys, guys like the Duke, Benny, Lionel, Charlie, Miles reached it, reached it at great expense but reached it, other guys though fall down, don't make it. Maybe it is lack of talent, perseverance, wit, or just plain old circumstances, bad luck or a wrong move but they fall down, fall down hard. Take Al Roberts (Tom Neal), the guy who is the guy in the wrong place at the wrong time in this gritty, cinematically interesting black and white beauty of a B-film noir under review, Detour. He had his dreams; he had his chance to take the brass ring but some stuff, some serious stuff, got in the way so we will never know whether he had the stuff to hit that big note floating out into the film noir night.
Yah, no question, Al Robert's was born under an unlucky star or something. Here was a guy with all kinds of talent, including some classical piano training playing for dimes and donuts to make ends meet at some back street supper clubs in New Jack City. On an lucky night he might caught a five or ten from some drunken party hungry to hear his sentimental journey stuff, stuff strictly meant for the tourist trade. The only bright spot was that his honey, a white night torch singer, was strictly first-rate and they, if they could ever rub two dimes together were going to get married. Oh yah, and as if to mock him, after that song bird made it big in Hollywood where she was headed to make herself a star before they got around to tying the knot.

Well you know the old Hollywood fame song by now. Al was lonely in New Jack City and song bird went crashing down, serving
them off the arm in some hash house in Santa Monica and so Al, penniless Al, decided to hitchhike out to share his honey's fate. That search for the high white note be damned, be detoured. And although the road cross-country was nothing but a lot of short haul rides and lonely waits at miserable back road cross roads in place like Neola, Iowa and Lawrence, Kansas he finally got a break, a guy, Haskell, a guy who was a step up in class with a big old convertible, maybe a Packard stopped and picked him up and said he was heading for the coast. Yes sir, a big break finally. Except that big break turned into an Al nightmare when the apparently sickly Haskell hauled off and died leaving Al holding the bag. Who, after all, was going to believe a fairly young guy with dough didn't meet with anything but foul play from a penniless tramp.
And in a way Al was right in his thinking. But he got a little cloudy in his thinking, a little confused, no, a lot confused. See Al came up with the bright idea that he would change identities with the deceased Haskell and abandon the car in L.A.  on his way to his honey. Not the best idea, really, but an idea. Except Al made one fatal move, not intentionally, but just as fatal nevertheless. He picked her up. Her being a wayward and mouthy femme fatale named Vera (Ann Savage) who, down or her uppers, was hitching the roads west.

But here is where Al really was born under an unlucky star. She, having hitched a ride earlier with the deceased Haskell and having had to fend him off, knew that Al did not own the car. Vera, nothing but a flat-out gold-digger and hustler, started squawking about her cut, or else. So she has them act as a married couple in order to bamboozle Haskell's estranged rich dying father into believing Al was his long lost son. Al finally balked at that and Vera threatened to call copper on him for Haskell's death. He tried to stop her once she was in a drunken rage by attempting to pull the telephone cord through the closed bedroom door on her. All he did though was strangle her accidently when she got caught up in the cord. Yah, but who was going to believe a tramp, a two- bit guy didn't have murder and mayhem in his heart not once but twice. So yah, he never did get to see his song bird. And worse, Al never got to reach for that high white night blowing our hard from some beachfront club with the Japan Current in the Pacific Coast night.",1375315200,,4205,4.292191435768262

3616592,5,B001GMS5O4,"Al Roberts(Tom Neal) is down and out:  broke and  hungry and his only mode of transportation is his thumb.  But Al doesn't like hitchhiking:  ""It's dangerous.  You never know what's in store for you"".  But nothing will deter him from finding his love, Sue(Claudia Drake).  Al and Sue used to perform at the second-rate ""Break 'O Dawn "" nightclub in New York City(Sue was the vocalist, Al the piano player).  Their relationship was ""healthy"" and Al was ""in heaven"" until Sue abandoned him for her dream of stardom in Hollywood.  But Sue's dream went bust and now she is slinging hash.  Al determines to find her and take care of her.  In the Arizona desert he is picked up by a pill popping ""piece of cheese and big blowhard"" named Haskell(Edmund MacDonald).  Haskell has nasty looking scratches on his arms, the result of an encounter with a  woman who didn't appreciate his attempt to get ""friendly"".  When Haskell zonks out from the pills Al takes over the driving.  Sometime in the night Haskell dies and Al panics.  Afraid he will be blamed for murdering Haskell, Al hides his body in the desert.  Then he takes off with the dead man's identity and car.  Outside Los Angeles he picks up a hitchhiker named Vera.  Vera is played by Ann Savage and never was an actress so aptly named for her part: Vera is the most ferocious female ever seen on screen.  Her eyes blaze with Hell fury.  Her voice cuts like a machete and every word that passes through her snarling lips is an insult.  At her most charming she is a vicious drunk.  Unfortunately for Al, Vera is Haskell's ""unfriendly"" woman.  She knows Al isn't Haskell and quickly takes control of him with threats of turning him in to the police so he can have some of ""that perfume"" Arizona dispenses in the gas chamber.  Vera decides Al will sell the car and give her all the money.  But to facilitate this they must pose as husband and wife.  Al is about to close the deal on the car when Vera stops him:  she has discovered that Haskell's wealthy,dying father wants to be reunited with the son he hasn't seen in fifteen years.  Vera tells Al he is going to pose as Haskell and collect millions.  For the first time Al stands up to the bullying woman and refuses.  The two argue through a booze soaked night.  Finally, a drunken Vera grabs the phone, locks herself in the bedroom, and tries to call the police.  Al grabs the cord from the other side of the door and tries to pull the phone away.  When he enters the room he discovers that Vera, in her drunkeness, fell with the cord wrapped around her neck.  Al has accidentally strangled her.  Once again, afraid he will be accused of murder, Al drifts away into the night.

What makes ""Detour"" so intriguing is it's point of view.  We never see anything as it happens.  Al narrates the action, we know only what he tells us.  And Al isn't telling the truth about a lot of things:  Al, Sue, and Vera are not young.  Al is pushing middle age and the women are already middle aged. And Vera is definitely not beautiful.  Quite frankly, she is a hag.  And a lot of things make no sense: Why do they need to pose as a married couple?  Why has Al been hitchhiking for years?  It doesn't take that long to get from New York to California.  Is it really plausible that the lazy, passive Al would actually take care of Sue?  And why is he so sure he will be accused of murdering Haskell? After all, the man's system will be full of drugs.  More likely, Al's profession is kept man and Sue is another dead body in another run down apartment house.  ""Detour"" is an endless guessing game of possibilities.

The movie is famous for it's cheapness but it really isn't that bad.  There are other movies with bigger budgets that look worse.  The quality of this DVD is pretty good.  There is one bad place but that is obviously on the negative.  All in all, an excellent buy for the price.  Highest recommendation.",1365033600,,3905,4.430183356840621
3616593,4,B001GMS5O4,"A reviewer mentioned most of the movie was filmed at night. Dauh It's called a Noir cool guy. This film isn't great by any means. I honestly don't know why people luv it so much. You gut a spineless guy being bullied to death by a mean girl & also you get 2 see his woman out in Hollywood act like a B---- & tramp around in order to make it big.

Both woman in this film got no redeeming qualities what so ever. The back story behind the original lead actor is pretty crazier. Even crazier a guy named Wade Williams supposedly bought old movies. That I guess conveniently went into public domain not long after. He made some cash & re-made this film. It's nice to see someone be so passionate about a film.

I wish it had been a better 1, but the re-creation & great use of color is good. Of course their are much better noir's out their in color & don't cost 50 Dollars for a damn VHS. But hey I'm an obsessive collector. Was the film worth 50 Dollars. Heck No. Did I enjoy it. We'll yeah. It's sorta interesting seeing the lead man go from so dark. Then flash back 2 him being all happy, bossed around nice guy 2 being all hard again like Eastwood. It's quite amusing.

I honestly wish more classy noirs were made & not updated in anyway except color. It sucks I searched everywhere for a cheap bootleg hopefully on DVD. Nope, all bootlegs are of the original film. Most people hardly know this film exists.

Oh trust me it does & it's a miracle it exists at all & I do get a smile on my face knowing I'm 1 of the only people who probably owns it. I'd suggest someone buying it. But whoops. Just like with Hoodlums & The Big Heist. Looks like I got the only available copy. We'll sorry about that. Maybe 1 day they'll get released.

3616594,3,B001GMS5O4,"Detour (1945) Is A Well Done Movie, but it is Also Grim and Depressing...Who Needs That?

Detour (1945) starring Tom Neal and Ann Savage is an excellent movie and deserves all the honors and ""best film of it's type"" listings it always gets everywhere. It's honored and should be honored.

But Detour (1945) starring Tom Neal and Ann Savage is a detailed portrait of a very unhappy man leading an unhappy and amazingly unlucky life.

It is grim and depressing. The movie is well acted, written, directed, and photographed. And all these result in the ""grim and depressing"" theme and result of the movie digging deep into the viewer and invading his dreams, conversation, and even ideas.

Ugh! In a way, it is sort of like an artist doing a good job at depicting human body waste in such accurate, stomach turning detail, the viewer becomes nauseated and vomits, winces, and otherwise is revolted.

Yes, the artist did a good job at accuracy and the result was a dramatic effect on viewers.

No, the result of viewing such art (and this applies to the experience of screening Detour [1945]) is not uplift or edification.

One can't even defend it as a cautionary tale, because the story told is so extremely unlikely and outlandish one can say with certainty such bad luck and bad results would never, ever happen in real life. They could, but most likely, they won't.

So, what's the point of praising and screening Detour (1945)? What is it's place in cinema history and on lists of honored movies (it appears on almost all such major lists)? Detour (1945) starring Tom Neal and Ann Savage is more than just a film for masochists who enjoy being made unhappy by watching a skillfully made movie bound to summon negative mental emotions.

It takes it's place among honored literary (if grim) art by writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, Ambrose Bierce, and Franz Kafka, and beside the work of honored studio artists such as Goya, David, and Picasso. Even Shakespeare's tragedies (King Lear and Hamlet) might be mentioned on this list of grim, unlikely, but dramatic and honored works of art.

Not for everybody, and not for consuming at all times in all places, but important, in a limited way.

I don't plan to screen it again soon.

3616596,3,B001GMS5O4,"<strong>Detour</strong> (Edgar G. Ulmer, 1945)

If you spend your time hanging around reading stuff written by people who make thousand-best lists, you're not going to get too far into any discussion of <em>noir</em> without hearing about Edward G. Ulmer's <em>Detour</em>. Which I do not mean to imply is a bad movie, but I can't quite grasp why people who should know better would be mentioning it in the same breath as such classics as <em>Night of the Hunter</em> and <em>Out of the Past</em>, both vastly superior to this.

Plot: Al Roberts (Tom Neal, who had been paired with Savage a few times previously) is a pianist with shattered dreams of making it at Carnegie Hall and a bubbly girlfriend named Sue (<em>The Return of Rin Tin Tin</em>'s Claudia Drake) who heads west to try and make it as an actress. Al gets lonely and decides to hitchhike out west to see her, accepting a ride from one Charles Haskell, Jr. (<em>Destry Rides Again</em>'s Edmund MacDonald), a vastly unlikable sort who meets with an untimely, if accidental, end. Al, terminally (and chronically) broke, appropriates Haskell's identity, and his fat wallet, and continues his journey out to California after a quick and incompetent hiding of the body, picking up another hitchhiker, Vera (<em>The Unwritten Code</em>'s Ann Savage), on the way. It turns out Vera and Haskell had some dealings before the opening frame, so she knows Al isn't who he claims to be... and cooks up a scheme for them to profit from it. It's at this point that Mr. Murphy (of the law), who has never been far offstage, steps in and starts really slapping the characters around...

All well and good, but what I simply cannot get my head around is the idea that Al would hang around with Vera, who is the very epitome of shrew, for any length of time instead of even attempting to develop some sort of plot to get out from under her. He obviously can't stand the woman, he's still carrying a torch for Sue, and he hasn't done anything wrong enough to come out the other end of things relatively unscathed, though he sees that last bit somewhat differently. Still, there would be ways to get out from under her that he never even thinks about. This being <em>noir</em>, you know nothing's going to end well, but the entire mechanism of this film is Al's Empedocles-like indecision, and it's infuriating. The guy couldn't have afforded a nickel to go watch Fred MacMurray in <em>Double Indemnity</em> and pick up a few pointers, or at least a warning sign or two? Sheesh. Still, as an example of dirty, low-rent <em>noir</em> that was cobbled together for next to nothing, it's not terrible. ** ",1335484800,,2647,4.785557986870897

3616598,3,B001GMS5O4,"Literally stumbled across this gem of a film.  Talk about a guy who can't win for losing, and the other folks who described Vera as ""the woman from hell"" were right on target.  The bad news is the this Alpha DVD is really really bad - the video is better than the audio, but that is faint praise.  But the film itself is worth a repeat viewing.",1328745600,,344,4.104477611940299
3616599,4,B001GMS5O4,"The black and white film noir genre is making a huge comeback and scores of old B&W films are now being released on DVD's in bunches. Film noir movies are ones where the protagonist, and mostly everyone else in the movie, are not very sympathetic characters. Think Bogie's Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon. Or Edmond O'Brien in D.O.A. They are flawed people, but the plot is so gripping, we follow their exploits anyway with more than a moderate degree of concern. (Roger Ebert once said the difference between a crime movie and film noir is that in a crime movie the bad guys knows that they are bad guys and want to stay that way. While a noir hero thinks he's a good guy who has been ambushed by life.)

Detour, a 1945 movie, staring Tom Neal and Ann Savage, and directed by Edgar J. Ulmer, certainly falls into this category.

Neal was a mainstay in B movies, staring in dozens of them in the 40's and into the early 50's. His career was derailed when Neal, a former boxer, KO'd actor Franchot Tone while they were fighting over a woman, breaking his nose and giving him a brain concussion. From that point on Neal, was reduced to small parts in obscure television shows. Neal was toast in the business for good, when in 1961, he shot his third wife Gale Bennett in the back of the head, killing her instantly. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in jail. He served six before he was paroled.

Savage, who acts in Detour with a permanent snarl on her face, made over twenty B movies between 1943-46. She was also a popular World War II pinup model and appeared in an Esquire centerfold. Stunningly beautiful, she steals this movie with a mouth dipped in vinegar.

Neal's troubled soul is evident in Detour, who some critics consider the greatest B movie of all time. Some critics even rate it as one the best 100 movies of all time. Detour was shot in six days, using a total of six sets, with a total budget of only $20,000. On the cheap, even for 1945.

Al Roberts (Neal) is a New York City piano player working in a cheap joint, who's in love with a singer named Sue (Claudia Drake), also struggling in the same dead-end dive. Sue decides to leave New York City for Hollywood for bigger things, leaving Roberts behind and not too happy. Lamenting the loss of his true love, Roberts decides to head west himself, but lacking the funds to go in style, he sticks out his thumb and hitchhikes. After making it as far as Arizona, he's picked up in a snazzy convertible by a man named Haskell (Edmund McDonald), who has fresh scratches on his hand and is popping pills like they were candy.

After a while, Roberts takes over the wheel, while Haskell takes a nap in the passengers seat. It starts pouring rain, so Roberts gets out to pull up the top, when he realizes Haskell is dead from an apparent heart attack. Roberts panics and drags Haskell's body onto the side of the road and down a gully. He changes into Haskell's clothes, takes his money, and afraid of being blamed for murder, he assumes Haskell's identity.

As fate would have it, Robert's makes a fatal mistake when he soon picks up a nasty-looking hitchhiker named Vera (Savage). It turns out Vera had hitched a ride earlier with Haskell and was the person who gave Haskell the scratches on his hand, apparently because Haskell had trouble keeping his hands off her drop-dead body. Vera realizes immediately that Roberts is wearing Haskell's clothes and driving Haskell's car. After pretending to sleep for a while, she bolts upright in the front passengers seat and shrieks, ""Where did you leave his body? What did you do to the owner of this car? You're not Haskell! What did you do -- kiss him with a wrench?""

Playing the bitch role to the hilt, Vera, sneer in place the entire movie, starts blackmailing Roberts. She demands the money Roberts took off Haskell's body and forces Roberts to sell Haskell's car for $1600, which she immediately pockets too. They rent an apartment in Hollywood and after they polish off a bottle of booze and start on another, Roberts says, ""Whichever way you turn, fate sticks out a foot to trip you.""

Vera reads in the newspaper that Haskell's rich father is dying and Haskell is set to inherit a huge fortune. She decides that Robert must impersonate Haskell so that she can divert that inheritance money to herself. Roberts refuses. The plot reaches a boiling point, then ends predictably in an unpredictable way. In a final bit of bad luck, Roberts is picked up by the police in the film's last shot.

As the film ends, Roberts laments in a voice-over, ""Fate, for some mysterious force, can put a finger on me or you. For no good reason at all.""

No good reason? How about calling the police next time a guy dies of a heart attack, instead of taking his clothes, his money and his car? Maybe then Roberts could have avoided the fickle finger of faith.

Darn, I hate cliques.

Fans of film noir will absolutely adore Detour. Neal and Savage both give performances for the ages, especially Savage, whose mean-spirited act leaves an indelible mark on cinematic history. Even if you're not a fan of the genre, you'll get sixty five minutes of taut suspense.

On a range of one to five stars I give Detour a strong 4 stars. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the director Ulmer's lack of funds forces him to shoot scenes that are visually unappealing and downright depressing, which in this movie, may not have been such a bad thing.

Still, the plot's the thing and Detour definitely delivers on that account.

DETOUR (1945) directed by Edgar G. Ulmer
****SPOILERS******

At a running time of 67 minutes this great little ""poverty row"" noir had the distinction of being the first of its kind to be chosen by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry.

Poor Al Roberts (Tom Neal) just can't catch a break. He plays piano in a New York dive so that he can scratch together enough money (in his words money is a piece of paper crawling with germs) so that he can get married to his girlfriend Sue (Claudia Drake). But wait! She has dreams of going to Hollywood so she decides to postpone the wedding indefinitely, and off she goes in search of her dreams.

I don't want to give too much away but things just go downhill from there. Either this film is the nightmare of a bum wallowing in self-pity or, if real, this cat is the unluckiest slob in the world. Just when you think his luck couldn't get worse he runs into a trainwreck named Vera (Ann Savage). Undoubtedly the most venal, selfish woman on the planet.

Vera: ""Say who do you think you're talking to - a hick? Listen Mister, I been around, and I know a wrong guy when I see one.""

Edgar Ulmer slipped into doing poverty row pictures but if you look real hard there are some gems out there. His 1934 movie ""The Black Cat"" with Karloff and Lugosi is one of my favorite horror films. In 1946 he directed a great film ""The Strange Woman"" based on a novel by Ben Ames Williams (Leave Her To Heaven). It starred Hedy Lamarr, George Sanders and Lewis Heyward.

Low-rent movie or not, ""Detour"" contains some dialogue that could serve as the Mantra for all ""noir"" films:

Al Roberts: ""I keep tryin' to forget what happened and wondered what my life would have been like if that car of Haskell's hadn't stopped. But one thing I don't have to wonder about. I know. Someday a car will stop to pick me up that I never thumbed.

Yes -- fate, or some mysterious force can put the finger on you or me for no good reason at all.""

3616605,5,B001GMS5O4,"What modern day film makers could learn from this one: it was made in only six days with no budget and tells a heck of a deliciously diabolical story in only 67 minutes. I have a very bad copy of this movie on VHS, it is not for everyone, I am sure, but it is for people like me and I give it five stars for what they were able to accomplish with nothing--nothing but a single great storyline, great acting by relative unknowns and great NOIR-y camera angles and deep tones.  A poor unmarried couple, played by Tom Neal and Claudia Drake, are struggling to get by.  She craves stardom and has a beautiful voice.  He plays piano in the (isn't this precious) Break O'Dawn Club. She decides to leave for Hollywood where she is determined to get discovered as a singer.  His heart is ripped out as he continues to take his frustrations out on the piano keys, getting a huge tip, BTW.  He can take it no more, he must hitchhike to California to be with his sweetie, Sue. He is finally picked up by a mysterious man. ""I never know what to say to strangers driving cars,"" he quips to himself for our benefit. The driver lets him in on the fact that a previous hitchhiker, female has scratched him up badly, so he kicked her to the curb.  The driver then strangely dies in the night as our friend Al is driving.  He realizes he may be blamed with the guy's death so he ditches the body and continues on, the next day he picks up a female hitchhiker.  It soon dawns on him that this is ""the scratcher,"" played so brilliantly by Ann Savage. She is a true psycho and her rants are only a couple of notches down from the possessed Regan in The Exorcist. In an aside he tells us, she has ""a beauty that is almost homely because it is so real."" Psycho-Vixen begins spinning her web of blackmail. She knows the owner of the car is dead and all she has to do is turn Al over to the police, if he doesn't obey her every command. When they get to LA she demands they get a motel room where she tries in vain to seduce him. She then goes on a drunken binge hurling more epithets at him. He confides to us, ""My goose was cooked."" Each time he thinks he has figured out a way to be rid of her, she plots another nefarious scheme. ""That's life.  Whichever way you turn, fate sticks out a foot to trip you."" As they both duke it out verbally and physically, the parasitic woman is accidently killed.  I will not spoil the ending. This is no GWTW, but it is a little masterpiece in noir films.  The background score is beautiful, but comical in that setting.  It is very much like other such films and their scores, and I cannot imagine any event in history not having this music playing in the background, a quirk of my own.  The camera work is splendid and there is one scene in particular where Sue is singing behind her microphone stand and in the backgroud are not real orchestra members, but black silhouettes, shadows of them on the wall at a slant, great stuff.
The dialogue in this movie is to die for, if you are a true afficionado.",1248220800,,3018,4.227826086956521
3616606,4,B001GMS5O4,"The Bottom Line:

A ""skid row"" production, Detour is an incredibly minimalist picture that manages to do a lot with very little and emerges as a interestingly-hard edged psychological thriller of a noir; the Hays Code-enforced ending detracts a little from the spirit of the film, but Detour is a diversion worth taking.

3.5/4",1245110400,,327,5.037037037037037
3616607,3,B001GMS5O4,"Detour is a great old noir film that heads off in the right direction before getting sidetracked.  But, despite the lost meandering, there are still a few scenes in the film worth seeing, and an overall theme that I found haunting and thought-provoking.

The film is pure noir.  Like my favorite film from the genre, Double Indemnity (review), it starts at the end, with a bedraggled protagonist who is about to flash back on how everything went horribly wrong.  It is the conceit that allows the classic noir voice-over to guide ensuing events.  As a fan of this genre, I never tire of the routine.  It isn't imitation so much as homage.  This is what makes the genre, and I would be ticked if certain expected elements weren't present.

The story of Detour is pretty simple.  Two lovers who both work the small-circuit music biz are separated when the woman decides to try her hand out in Hollywood.  Some time passes and the man, Al Roberts (Tom Neal), decides to journey west to join her.  Low on funds, he resolves to hitching clear across the country.  But of course, from the title of the film, we know that his trip is going to take a route more scenic than he would like.

The problems begin when Roberts gets into the convertible of a wealthy dude heading for California.  While Roberts is taking a turn at the wheel as the owner of the car gets some sleep, it begins to rain.  Stopping to put the top up, Roberts is unable to wake the owner.  When he opens the door, the man spills out and bangs his head on a rock.  This doesn't seem to help in rousing the poor fellow.  Roberts can find no sign of life and realizes that this will look like a robbery, no matter what he tells authorities.  So he decides he should at least use the car to get to Hollywood.  But he'll need money for gas, and he will be guilty whether he robs the man or not, so he takes his wallet.  But the cops would never believe that a man dressed like himself would own such a car, and they are similar builds, so he switches outfits as well.

The process of gradually rationalizing one's way from a small mistake to the worst sort of crime is entirely believable.  The actions of an innocent man who knows he will be found guilty anyway are perfectly recreated.  This was the spooky theme of the film, and nothing scurries me to the edge of my seat quicker than the plight of an innocent man accused.  The film was starting off perfectly for me as things were going bad for Roberts.  And things are about to get worse.

After a close call with motorcycle cop right there at the scene, Roberts feels like he is in the clear and will soon be with his honey in Hollywood, able to forget this unfortunate turn of luck.  But when he sees a female hitchhiker he is unable to resist giving her a lift out of empathy.  The problem is that she has already been given a ride by the man that owns this very car, and she knows that Roberts isn't him!

The rest of the film is basically a hostage situation, with the female hitchhiker, Vera (Ann Savage) threatening to turn Roberts in unless he gives her the dead man's money and whatever they can get for selling the car.  Their back and forth banter has some excellent moments, with the pace and lethality of machine-gun fire which is typical of the genre.  But I feel like the movie missed a better story by taking the second detour.  The stolen identity tale would have been more entertaining, and there were hints in the second half that it was at least considered.  But perhaps due to budget concerns, the second act takes place almost entirely in a hotel room, and does not live up to the expectations created earlier.  The only saving grace is the great death scene at the end, which is just the sort of tragic and unforeseen conclusion I expect of good noir.

Overall the film played out like a realistic road trip.  It started with thrills, anticipation, and excitement and then it became hard to stay awake as we got to the second half of the drive.  At the end there was enough of a spectacle to make the journey worthwhile, but only barely.  This is a brief adventure that you recommend to people you know are into this sort of thing while knowing that everyone else will be satisfied with a postcard.  If you like noir, please check the film out.  If you don't, I hope you enjoyed the review and I suggest you give Double Indemnity a go.  Maybe you will become a fan and journey back to this one for more.",1238284800,,4441,4.365853658536586

3616609,5,B001GMS5O4,"____Well, in life, values and purposes are all at last relative and debatable. In this film, the protagonist, Al Roberts, apparently at first should be classified as a jinx man. He's truly a winner, this is, a master and a top artist in the art of losing, as I think for attain so constant bad luck, one has to be predestined, born so, and more, to train and cultivate.
Effectively, Roberts is a truly pessimistic man and from the beginning he has that dash. Later we understand why. He's full of reasons for this. Not only this movie shows the big problem of the man who takes him while doing auto stop and  dies during the travel by natural but suspicious motives, but there are the small details: if Roberts drives a convertible car and the hood is down, it begins to rain furiously while the owner dies and the hood, of course, is blocked; if also he's very tired, he has to drive hundreds of kilometres with bad night vision, if he was in a lonely highway in a compromising situation, a policeman has to  appear just then, if there's too much heat at the hotel, the windows are closed, if Robert wants to open these windows, someone impedes him to do, all that, impossible to remedy.
Prevision, reflection and taking of decisions  isn't neither the strong point of Roberts, as I think he commits a basic error by no declaring the death of Hassel, the owner of the car, and taking his money and documentation, starting so a series of confusions and disgraces fortunately he seems to be accustomed to coping with. Moreover, the car documentation results insufficient and incomplete to sell the car, as Hassel the dead owner, also seems not to have been an example of virtue during his life. To close all this, he finds a woman which truly is a specie of insufferable feminine devil.
And at the end, another succession of improbable accidental facts (but for Robert, we have to believe by then that abnormal and accidental things are normal). The case is all these happenings avoids him to be arrested and stay perhaps more sure and perhaps even happy in jail, but this is not, and he continues free to follow with his terrible fate and life, as he's still young enough to suffer many other misadventures.
But in the same way accumulation of all these errors make Roberts to remain free, in this movie, facts and adventures are done and disguised with so great talent and mastery, that this  movie, full of artifice, is a masterpiece, perhaps because we all have passed sometimes a luck so black as that of Al Roberts.",1234742400,,2520,4.580931263858093

""What kind of dames thumb rides?  Sunday school teachers?""

I guess this would be the most appropriate tagline for this black and white grade B noir from 1945.  Al Roberts (Tom Neal) is the one asking the rhetorical question, although it could have been Charles Haskell Jr. (Edmund MacDonald) who has some nasty scratches on his hand to prove he can speak from experience.  The lady in question is Vera (Ann Savage) who can turn on you like a cornered rat and strike at you like a rattlesnake, which is what she does to Roberts after he's picked her up hitchhiking.  In a scene as startling as any I've seen in quite a while, Vera wakes from a nap and suddenly, without warning, but in retrospect with plenty of foreshadowing, viciously tears into Roberts who finds himself caught in a deadly vice of his own making.

Roberts plays it passively, a born loser who knows he's losing again.  A pianist who once dreamed of Carnegie Hall, he just knuckles under to Vera who comes off as a dom...--well, I won't use the word, but she appears to be the kind of dame who likes black leather while welding certain items of inducement, shall we say.  But Roberts can't get a yen for her since he's still in love his sweetheart, a night club singer named Sue Harvey (Claudia Drake).  Too bad, if he had, he might have gotten the upper hand in his relationship with Vera because she certainly wants him.  Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, it is said, and 'tis true, I can tell you, but Vera had the fury from first glance.

Some of the dialogue is pretty lame, dime novel realistic you might say, the kind of talk that is written on the fly without imagination.  E.g., ""As I drove off, it was still raining and the drops streaked down the windshield like tears,"" which might not have been half bad except that the windshield wipers were flapping and there were no tracks of anybody's tears...  Or, how about this: ""Life's like a ball game. You gotta take a swing at whatever comes along before you find it's the ninth inning.""

Strange to say though, sprinkled among the prosaic and the banal are such gems as the one at the top of this review and this: ""So when this drunk handed me a ten spot after a request, I couldn't get very excited. What was it I asked myself? A piece of paper crawling with germs. Couldn't buy anything I wanted.""

Sociologically speaking, this is a bit of a retrofit from the Depression era which featured gritty tales about guys down on their luck hitchhiking and looking for that one big shot at something, anything, love, money, half a break.  And Roberts, even though a pianist of some talent, is like a James M. Cain protagonist, an ordinary Joe who gets involved with a dame (or two) and somehow makes the wrong moves and ends up in the deepest of deep quagmires.  And like many another antihero, we can sympathize with him although we know and can see it's mostly his own damn fault.  Fate has dealt him a bad hand that he should have tossed in, but he plays it out with the kind of fatalism that would befit a minor Greek tragedy.",1233273600,,3214,4.416949152542373

3616614,5,B001GMS5O4,"Detour is the first poverty row film chosen for conservation by the Library of Congress. The cast is largely unknown and the studio PRC Pictures specialised in extremely low budget movies. Detour, their biggest success was shot in 6 days by cult director Edgar Ulmer.

The star of the picture, Tom Neal was a Harvard Law Graduate in real life. He was known for his difficult temperament which limited the roles he was offered by the major studios. In 1951 he beat up Franchot Tone over a girl giving him a broken nose and cheekbone. In 1965 he was hauled up for the murder of his wife and eventually found guilty of ""involuntary manslaughter"". Charming leadman huhn? The femme fatale, played by Ann Savage is supposed to be 24 in the movie. She looks much older but really was 24 when Detour was made. She made a total of 5 films with Neal - who regularly used to hit on her.

The lighting in the film is superb and it is quite taut at only 67 minutes. All the successful noir films from that period were being made by the big studios and involved talents like Billy Wilder, John Huston, Jacques Tourneur etc. This film contributed greatly to the genre with its success because it was a good entry to the genre with a Grade B budget. This encouraged a whole spate of other low-budget noirs although none of them were as good. Edmund MacDonald gives a fairly good performance. The only disappointing thing was the ending.

3616615,5,B001GMS5O4,"Detour is one of the all-time great examples of film noir.  The use of shadowy black and white cinematography, a star-crossed protagonist, a femme fatale, a cynical voice-over narration and ambiguous morality can almost be used to define the Film Noir Genre.  Brought together by legendary director Edgar G. Ulmer in only a few days and on a diminutive budget, Detour's B-Film sets only add to both the film and the genre, a true testament to the mastery of Ulmer.

Al Roberts (Tom Neal) makes a series of bad choices that bring him to a very low point in his life.  Vera (Ann Savage) plays the quintessential Bad Girl.  Their witty repartee and in truth, much of the dialogue throughout is a main attraction of this film.  The plot is revealed in flashbacks and continues on uncompromisingly to the conclusion.

a certain amount of film and was told by the studio that he had to shoot within 15 miles of the studio's headquarters. Despite those limitations, this is a classic 1945 low-budget film noir directed by Edgar G. Ulmer.

Though I wouldn't go as far as to call it surreal, the low budget quality and the simplicity of the plot make it almost dream like. It's 67 minutes of pure noir bliss.

Al is a talented and going no where fast piano player.  He's a good guy the kind you only see in old movies, but this isn't just an old movie it's a film noir.  Why name it noir?  To make it arty.  I guess it's better then film black which is what the future is looking here for good ole Al.
So why such negativity bub?  If Al's on the up and up.  Well his girl is sick of the night club scene see, so instead of marrying Al she's doing the opposite literally and heading to L.A.
Al needs his girl bad so he's heading to L.A but the only bad he's got is luck and plenty of it.  A ride he hitches ends up hitching a ride to the pearly gates during a rain storm leaving Al looking responsible, he comes up with a plan but like all plans things happen.  One of those things is Vera a tough as nails girl who sees through Al like a window; kind of like a rear window, which fits like a glove seeing Al is like a wrong man framed out of an old Hitchcock flick.  He's not the wrong man though or do we have it all wrong? Talk about when it rains it pours, better put on your overcoat it's going to be a bumpy ride.

That was fun and so is this film noir.  It's all about the dialogue in these films and this one has it.  It doesn't take a wrong turn in this fast paced hour and 7 mins full of thrills.

3616629,4,B001GMS5O4,"Those of you who've read other reviews already know the plot. It won't be rehashed here.

I'd like to post some thoughts on this drama. Only one other reviewer has offered an alternate solution, viz., that Al is really a murderer who's giving us an unbelievable story. I quite agree with him.

Al's account of both deaths aren't believable; one death, while possible, is unlikely, while the other one is flat out ridiculous. It makes more sense to me that Al's trying to convince the audience with the tale he's planning to give to the police. I'm sorry, Al, but it won't do; I'd vote to convict you.

Al's account of Vera's character is very believable, though. One really has to see Ann Savage's portrayal of Vera to believe it. What an arch-*itch she is! Maybe the most evil woman to ever hit the screen. She'll make your skin crawl. The movie's worth buying just to see this performance, especially the scene in the car where she turns on him. Villany personified! It's easy to see why he ""killed"" her--if he  did. You decide.

A couple of plot holes exist. Vera tries to get Al into some money-making schemes that wouldn't really work, from a legal standpoint--even in 1945. Moreover, the first death (supposedly from natural causes [but not really]) would have easily been detected through an autopsy; the victim is seen taking what is presumably heart medication, which would have been found in the glove department.

One point nobody's pointed out: at the end, one isn't sure whether Al's actually being picked up by the police, or if he's just daydreaming/visualizing the scene where he's actually is. This isn't really a plot hole, though, merely an ambiguity.

An interesting tidbit: even in 1945, there were inspection stations in California--""Do you have fruits, vegetables, or livestock?"" Another one--evidently, in those days, driver's licenses only contained a description, not a picture.

The print I saw on TCM is in very poor condition. The dialogue is sometimes inaudible. In some of the early scenes, the picture is badly blurred. A couple of times, definite signs of nitrate decomposition are noticed.(The print has those spots in the frame that are the sign of this decomposition; it looks like moldy cheese or something.) In the scene in the car, while Vera and Al are talking, frames and dialogue are actually missing. Presumably, those frames had decomposed too much to be used. It makes the viewer realize that, sadly, tons of films are in desperate need of restoration.

4 stars. I only docked one point for the poor quality of the print.

See the movie; you won't regret it.",1165881600,,2603,4.842342342342342

Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe Hollywood crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic...Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s...Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Depression...the term film noir (French for ""black film""), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most of the American filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs..the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics; many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film.

Five-disc collector's set includes ""SCARLET STREET"" (1945) (95 mins/Universal Pictures), featuring Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Dan Duryea and Margaret Lindsay --- ""DETOUR"" (1945) (67 mins/PRC), featuring Tom Neal, Ann Savage, Claudia Drake and Edmund MacDonald --- ""THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTA IVERS"" (1946) (117 mins/Paramount Pictures), featuring Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, Kirk Douglas, Lizabeth Scott and Judith Anderson --- ""WHISTLE STOP"" (1946) (85 mins/United Artists) featuring George Raft, Ava Gardner, Victor McLaglen, Tom Conway and Jorja Curtright --- ""HE WALKED BY NIGHT"" (1948) (80 mins/Eagle-Lion), featuring Richard Basehart, Scott Brady, Jack Webb, Roy Roberts, Whit Bissell and James B.

Film noirs tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm, often fall guys of one sort or another...the characteristic heroes of noir are described by many critics as ""alienated""; in the words of Silver and Ward, ""filled with existential bitterness.""...certain archetypal characters appear in many film noirs--hardboiled detectives, femmes fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers...as can be observed in many movies of an overtly neo-noir nature, the private eye and the femme fatale are the character types with which film noir has come to be most identified, but a minority of movies now regarded as classic noir feature either...crime, usually murder, is an element of almost all film noirs; in addition to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation...a crime investigation--by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur--is the most prevalent, but far from dominant, basic plot...in other common plots the protagonists are implicated in heists or con games, or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs...false suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses...amnesia is far more common in film noir than in real life, and cigarette smoking can seem virtually mandatory.

This collection of ""The Ultimate Film Noir"" (1945-1953) --- still has the magic that we remember from those bygone years --- but as long as we have the labels and networks who play and show these wonderful films of yesteryear, they will never be forgotten --- plus the Bonus of Best of Film Noir on the final disc --- and a great job by Passport Video for this release --- looking forward to more of the same from the '40s and '50s vintage...order your copy now from Amazon or Passport Video, stay tuned once again for more remarkable films from the vaults of classic television and Hollywood during the Golden Era of Film Noir --- All My Heroes have been Gumshoe Detectives!

Savage is so brutal that her insults, put-downs and nasty demeanor just make you laugh out loud. If this was made today, I could the imagine the profanity spewing out of her. She shows you don't need that to get your points across.

The movie, as a whole, is not as good as many critics would have you believe. Until Savage enters, it's so-so at best.

Al Robert's [Tom Neal] takes a detour into the twilight zone, literally, in a dark tale that he narrates in flashback form. It plays like a nightmare where the dreamer wishes he could wake up, but can't.

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: FILM NOIR IN ITS MOST TAWDRY FORM

Somehow, Al Roberts finds himself hitchhiking across the USA to reconnect with Sue, [Claudia Drake] formerly a nightclub singer where he played the piano, who thought Hollywood was her destiny. Everything was going slowly but surely according to plan until Roberts connected with his last ride in Arizona.

Charles Haskell, Jr [Edmund MacDonald] picks Roberts up, and after a meal takes a nap while Roberts drove to L.A.. Only after if it begins raining into the open top car which forced Roberts to stop does it become apparent that something is wrong with Haskell. In fact, Haskell had died, probably of a heart attack. This is where the film-noir dankness really kicks in.

ABOUT THE VIDEO: TRANSFER QUALITY IS VARIABLE ON VHS

Parts of this film, particularly the evening settings, are really in rough shape. It almost looks like parts of the film were taken from TV station cuts on 16 mm film that were adapted for home video. Nevertheless, the film, recorded on SP mode, is watchable, and the rough texture of the film's tone seems to play well on a less than perfect transfer of this 60 year old B-film.

BOTTOM LINE: JUST LOOK AT WHAT CAN BE CREATED IN JUST 6 DAYS!

A dark and sinister nightmare that plays out as a fascinating very-low budget B-film. Detour clearly illustrates how the right director can create a potent, and expressive vehicle even out of the most shoddy materials available and in just 6 days.",1143158400,,2240,4.758441558441558

Granted, I do agree with much of what has been written and I would give this movie a high rating; certainly one worthy of a high recommendation, but... I saw the entire premise of this movie in a different light than any other reviewer, evidently. Most of them saw the Tom Neal Character of Al Roberts as either a fool, a chump or the unluckiest guy in the world. I saw him as a murderer! This entire movie is shown from Roberts' point of view, remember, in the form of flashbacks and his own narration. As the movie progresses, we can hear him attempting to rationalize, and justify, the murder of both Haskell and Vera. The 'ride' he is taking the viewer on is one he has orchestrated himself. It's as if we, the viewers, are the jury and Al Roberts, on trial for the murders, is 'telling' us what 'really' happened. Wink-wink, nudge-nudge. For example, after Haskell is 'discovered' dead in his car and Roberts drags him into a ravine to hide the body, his voice-over narration lets us know the reason he 'had' to take the man's wallet. Of COURSE, a dead man has no use for over 700 bucks, and Al was broke... and, of COURSE, no one would believe that such an expensive car would belong to a man so shabbily dressed, so Al just HAD to switch clothes with the corpse. Yeah, right, Al. Then comes the lovely, charming and oh-so-demure Vera. After Roberts 'finds' her strangled by a telephone cord, we, the jury, are supposed to believe that's just the way it happened, never mind that it is patently ridiculous. He wants us to believe he is just a poor, dumb schlock who made some bad decisions and Fate took over from there. Oh, and lookie here... here's yet ANOTHER example of the HORRIBLE luck this unfortunate, miserable schmuck has run into. A police car just HAPPENS to be waiting for him as he leaves the diner. My word, how badly this poor schlemeel has been treated by Lady Luck! Anyway, that's my take on this whole story. He killed two people and is trying to make us believe he is a victim of cruel Fate. Well, as foreman of this jury, I'm not buying it. I find the defendant, Al Roberts, GUILTY as charged. Thank you, your honor. Oh yeah, this is a review.... Great flick, good acting (especially the frighteningly convincing performance of Ann Savage as the Devil herself), and a fun 'hypotheical' story that can be confusing. As I say, is he really a murderer, or a poor, unlucky victim himself? Sort of reminds me of the ending of Total Recall.

While the black and white film has all the earmarks of this genre including tough unforgiving broad Vera played by the acerbic Ann Savage, it fails to pull you in.

Neal's girlfriend Sue Harvey played by Claudia Drake a nightclub singer in the same dive he works in forsakes his marriage proposal for the bright lights of Hollywood.  Neal realizes that he can't live without her and plans to hitchhike his way out to California.

His tale is told in flashback fashion while he sits unshaven and disheveled in a roadside diner ruminating over a cup of java.

With Neal taking over the wheel MacDonald catches 40 winks.  Soon thereafter Neal realizes that MacDonald has actually expired in his sleep.  Fearing being apprehended for killing him, he hides the body along the roadside and takes his car, money and clothes and assumes his identity.

Realizing that Neal isn't who he says he is, she threatens him with revealing his supposed crime to police.  In this way she holds him a vertible prisoner with this threat of extortion while she plays angles necessary to bilk Haskell's possessions.

3616638,2,B001GMS5O4,"Touted as a defining example of Film Noir, it fails to deliver the goods.  Sure, it has the lighting, the hard boiled dialogue, and the mood, but it ends up being more comedy than suspense.

For starters, voice-over is overused throughout the film to explain or justify behavior that is just plain irrational.  Take Haskel's death and Robert's entry into his ""Detour."" Robert's explains why he ""had"" to swap bodies, rob a dead man, and flee.  Anybody with an ounce of sense and the thoughts explored in the voice over would have called the police--and been released and on their way.

Adding to the implausibility, Roberts ends up picking up Vera, the ""dame"" who had earlier ridden--and fought--with Haskel.  This is interesting as a plot device and might have worked if it had been handled with a delicate touch.  Had Vera played a little cat-and-mouse with this information it might have been pulled off.  But she doesn't.  She drops the bomb in Robert's lap with the subtlety of a chainsaw, and the improbability sinks a film already built on unstable ground.

Finally, taking the improbability over-the-top is Vera's ""accidental"" death, supporsedly at Robert's hands.  What did he kill her with--a dirty look?  Too much voice over?  She runs into a bedroom of her own volition and then she's dead?  What the...?  Huh?

3616640,1,B001GMS5O4,"Were you laughing and confused at the same time as you watched this film?  I was as I attempted to watch the first ""official"" Hollywood film noir thriller, Detour.  Filmed in 1945, this film took some heavy risks that the normal Hollywood production at this time was not willing to take.  Detour dabbled in heavy themes, dark context, and highly developed characters, yet seemingly lacked in production and acting.  While watching Detour, it became obvious that these missing elements turned this film sour.

The production of this film consisted of three scenes:  a hotel room, the restaurant, and finally (the majority) scenes of a car with a screen behind it.  It was obvious that there was no budget.  Due to these budget restraints, the overall elements of this film were completely clouded in spotty backgrounds and amateurish acting.  This was a case in which more money would have helped create a stronger film.  Normally, this is not my feeling, but for some odd reason, Detour brought this thought come out in me.

Finally, perhaps it was the era that this film was made, or maybe it was something else, but I felt as if both the director and the editor could have been heavily intoxicated while filming Detour.  The scenes are so jumbled together and are so horribly spliced that you can tell when the actors have made a mistake or when the director had to cut and start again.  Perhaps this would not have been the case if the director had a better grasp of what he wanted to do and how to do it.  The plot, due to the direction, seemed implausible at best.  I had trouble coming to terms with the fact that an educated man would run from the law (and steal from a man) when he did nothing to cause his death.  Any man of the law would listen to his story, look at the evidence, and see that Al is innocent.

When Al runs from the law near the beginning of the film, it made me consider a point that was never developed in Detour.  Was Al crazy?  When he hides the body, thinking that he killed Haskell, we begin to see a side of Al that was not obvious in the first fifteen minutes of this film.  Something, from before this film began, changed Al.  What was this changing event?  The world may never know, but it would have been helpful seeing at least a few scenes of Al's past to help develop his character a bit more.  This was the same with Vera.  I didn't know enough about her to really get a grip on her character.  I needed more between her and Haskell before her meeting with Al.

While Hollywood has expanded and obviously grown this genre over the years, it was interesting to see its beginnings.  Unfortunately, due to poor production and overacting, this was not the best film to begin the genre.  Detour is a ""starter"" film.  It reminds me of buying a house, it isn't the house of your dreams (or in this case film), but it does allow you to begin building towards your next dream.

3616641,4,B001GMS5O4,"This review is for the DVD released by Alpha Video in 2002.

The storyline of this movie focuses on a piano player in an east coast nightclub named Al Roberts (Tom Neal).  Al is dating a nightclub singer named Sue Harvey (Claudia Drake) and when he confronts her about getting married she tells him that she needs to establish her career in Hollywood before tying the knot.  So she moves to L.A.  and not too long after, Al decides to meet her in California.  It appears his only option is hitchhiking across the country.  By the time he reaches Arizona, he is completely broke and is picked up by a bookie named Charles Haskell.  From this point on (without revealing the entire story), there is a tragic twist of fate for Al and has to make some moral choices and unfortunately makes the wrong ones.  But his choices are not without consequences as he meets a woman named Vera (Ann Savage).

The movie itself is very simple.  It uses rarely known actors and was probably made on a shoestring budget.  Tom Neal does a great job starring as the hapless road traveler and Ann Savage wasn't much to look at, but does a respectable job as a blackmailing, browbeating scank.  Without revealing the whole story, there are two tragic incidences that are crucial to the plot and neither event was convincingly executed to be fully believable in my opinion.  But if you accept the outcome each major event, it's an enticing movie with an outcome that has some redemption for what these characters deserve.  It's clearly a very dark and viscous movie for its time, yet its interesting to see how culturally different it was compared to movies being made today - especially in a situation where an unmarried couple is living together.

As for the DVD quality, as is the case with many of Alpha's releases, it's essentially an un-restored, non-enhanced transfer from a film with some intermittent wear.  The picture lacks sharpness and contrast one expects from a DVD and the sound is fair.  There is a 4 or 5 second sequence where the master film appears to have been creased thus causing a very wavy look to the picture.  But if you are a little forgiving about the picture quality, you should be able to follow the story without any problems or major distractions.

The film is about a man who hitchhikes across country to be with his sweetheart, only to run into trouble along the way.  He's not a bad guy.  But you couldn't convince a judge and jury of that.

I'm not interested in recommending it as an example of film noir of the 1940s.  This isn't a classroom.  I give it a lukewarm three star rating.  The film did hold my interest but it fell far short of greatness.  The most memorable character in it is the witch of a hitchhiker.

The main character is a bland monotone of a man.  His sweetheart has an annoying personality but is a terrific singer.  The witch-hiker is even more annoying, which is really going some.  She's so nasty that she becomes memorable.

One problem I have with the story is that at several turns of the plot I found myself thinking ""Oh no, don't do that!"", and sure enough he does it, and it lands him in trouble.  In other words, the leading male character is a moron, causing his own problems.

Why doesn't this fool simply report what happened to the police from the start?  He wouldn't have gotten in trouble.  And why does this total moron pick up a hitchhiker at a time when secrecy was his only safe option?",1122422400,,1381,4.282945736434108

It's about a very introverted and weird man, Tom Neal, traveling across country to get to a woman who he has just gotten to agree to marry him after several attempts. He has no car or money so he hitch hikes. He is picked up by a very mysterious man, Charles Haskill, who is obviously hiding something and also takes pills for what appears to be a heart condition but we never find out for sure.

The hitch hicker is now driving while the owner of the car sleeps. The hitcher tries to wake him up but can't so he pulls over , opens up the door and the man falls out, hits his head on a rock and is dead. Now of course the hitcher immediately tries to cover everything up and take the guy's money which we find out he had a lot of. He feels real bad about it, of course, but thinks nobody will believe the truth. So this is basically the basis for the whole movie. Then he picks up a hitch hicker in the dead man's car (brilliant idea) and she turns out to have known the dead man and figures out that this guy killed him. So then she blackmails him to try and get as much money as she can. There are some slight sparks on her end but not on his. The woman that plays this part is very over the top! Making her appear comical and unbelievable. Anyways, the guy kills her by accidentally strangling her with the phone cord through a door. He feels real bad about that too. He never does make it to his fiancee and all the loose ends finally catch up to him. blah,blah,blah.

Bottom line - I don't think this movie was well acted, directed, written, or filmed, and it's hard to take seriously.",1121817600,,1812,4.058659217877095
3616644,4,B001GMS5O4,"""Detour"" may not have the budget but it does have all of the elements down of classic noir.  The shadowy black-and-white cinematography, the hard-luck anti-hero, the dangerous femme-fatale, the weary voice-over narration.  The script's twists and turns compensate for the film's low overhead.  What I found interesting is director Edgar G. Ulmer's casting of Ann Savage as the venomous Vera.  Savage is not what you would call pretty in any conventional sense but she is perfect for this part.  The glare in Savage's eyes and her consumptive cough suggest that her character's walk on the wild side aged her beyond her 24 years.  Anybody interested in the genesis of forties noir should check out ""Detour"" as one of the defining film's of the genre.",1117411200,,749,5.0
3616645,4,B001GMS5O4,"""Detour"" is a low budget film noir whose low budget really shows. But it's a classic tale of a man who falls victim to his own foibles, with the help of an unscrupulous woman and  a series of fateful coincidences. Al Roberts (Tom Neal) is a struggling pianist in New York City who plans to marry Sue (Claudia Drake), the singer in the club where they both work. But Sue doesn't want to give up on her career just yet. She wants to try her luck out in Hollywood before she settles down. A resentful Al eventually decides to stop sulking and join her in Hollywood. He can't afford transportation, so he hitchhikes his way westward. Somewhere in Arizona he is picked up by a well-to-do bookie (Edmund MacDonald) who can drive him all the way to L.A. But the man dies of apparently natural causes. Afraid that he will be suspected of murder, Al hides the body and takes the man's identity. But he makes the mistake of picking up another hitchhiker: a rough, tough-talking woman named Vera (Ann Savage), who happens to have known the dead man.

""Detour"" is told mostly in flashback with voiceover narration by Al. Al is a morose man who tends toward self-pity and seems to unconsciously be seeking something other than what he admits. If you get past the low production values, this is a wonderfully sardonic story about a couple of characters who start out poorly and spiral downward from there. Ann Savage's performance is unforgettable. Vera isn't the typical femme fatale. She dispenses with such niceties as  seduction and manipulation in favor of outright bullying and blackmail. She's predatory, hateful, and, yes, savage -which makes it easy to remember the actress who brought her to life. ""Detour"" has a distinct B-movie flavor, and even noir aficionados may be taken aback by Vera's viciousness. But this is a gritty classic.",1109289600,,1831,4.751572327044025
3616646,5,B001GMS5O4,"Have you ever wondered how little things--a hitchhiker you pick up, a newspaper you buy--can change your life forever? Edgar G. Ulmer certainly did, and in his zero-budget 1945 film noir, ""Detour,"" he demonstrates how they can ruin even the remotest chance of happiness. The film looks cheap--the photography is muddy, the continuity choppy, the sets out of Edward D. Wood--but Ulmer, a former assistant to F.W. Murnau, knew how to create memorable visual effects on no budget, so that most of the movie seems to be drifting in a hellish limbo. In ""Detour,"" fate is totally a matter of chance, and any decision you make is bound to be the wrong one. What is particularly fascinating about ""Detour"" is that neither goodness nor street smarts are of any use: scheming, hard-bitten Vera (Ann Savage) gets no closer to achieving her dreams than does naive, well-meaning Al (Tom Neal). They are the couple from Hell, trapped in a B-movie ""No Exit"" in which they can never feel anything for each other except bitter hatred. (No wonder the French were the first to hail ""Detour"" as a masterpiece: this is existentialism distilled to its essence.) By now most fans of ""Detour"" know the film noir turns that Tom Neal's life took in reality; what is less well known is that Edgar Ulmer and Ann Savage had some noirish twists in their own lives. Ulmer, who emigrated to Hollywood from Germany in the early 1930s, started out as an A-list director; but when he ran off with the wife of studio head Carl Laemmle's nephew, he was henceforth and forever blackballed to Poverty Row. As for Savage, she retired from the screen in the early 1950s, only to find herself suddenly penniless in 1969 when her supposedly wealthy husband died, leaving nothing but debts. She was forced to work in a law office well into her old age, returning to the screen only briefly, playing an elderly nun in the 1986 B-movie ""Fire With Fire.""",1106179200,,1907,4.72972972972973

  We go back to where this story begins in New York. Al is a piano player for the Break O'Dawn nightclub. He plays solo and for Sue (Claudia Drake) and the band. Him and Sue had plans, but she tells him she is leaving this dive and moving to California. Some time goes by and after receiving a $10 tip, he decides to give Sue a phone call.

As in this movie, Tom Neal had a troubled life. In 1965, Neal returned from New York to reconcile with his third wife, Gale Bennet. Their was a fight and a gun went off. Neal was not seen at her home, but police found her with a gunshot in the back of her head and a blanket covering over her. Tom Neal was considered a suspect and confessed. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. He was released from prison in December 1971.
  On August 7, 1972, Tom Neal was found in bed by his 15 year old son. He had died from heat failure at the age of 58.

  In 1992, Tom Neal Jr., the son of Tom Neal,  tried his hand at the same role his father played 47 years ago, in a remake of ""Detour"" shot on video.  Same story, some things added, different ending. Started in black & white and changes to color.

3616650,5,B001GMS5O4,"An unshaven and weather-beaten young man sits brooding over a cup of coffee in an anonymous roadside caf&eacute;.  A man of means by no means, as Roger Miller would put it.  But Al Roberts (Tom Neal) is king of no road, and by the end of DETOUR we wonder whether he is even sovereign over his own soul.
 A potential ride in the form of a friendly trucker strikes up a conversation.  Where you coming from? West.  Where you going to? East.
 Roberts is wrong, though.  He's coming from Hell and he's going to Nowhere, and the last thing he needs is a chatty trucker along for company.
 DETOUR is told in a flashback from that lonely stool.  Roberts and his girlfriend work as pianist/singer in a fleabag club out east.  Comes a foggy night and she splits up with him to pursue fame out west.  Weeks later he calls and they agree to get back together.  He'll come out west and they can be married.
 Being down at his heels Roberts is forced to hitchhike to California.  All goes well until he reaches Arizona, where Fate deals Roberts one nasty hand after another.  In short order the innocent Roberts finds and feels himself a hunted man.
 DETOUR is a wonderful film.  Neal is perfect as the moody young musician who finds himself trapped first by and accident and later by femme fatale Ann Savage, who know his terrible secret and has no scruples against using it against him for her own nefarious purposes.  Veteran B-movie director Edgar Ulmer has enough tricks up his sleeves to surmount the Poverty Row studio conditions he was working under.  If you're a fan of film noir, or enjoy hard-bitten stories, you'll enjoy DETOUR.
By the way, my thirty year old first edition copy of The Film Encyclopedia had an interesting entry on DETOUR'S star Tom Neal. He received a law degree from Harvard University in 1938.  Throughout the forties he appeared in a number of B-movies, usually cast as a tough guy.  In 1951 he found himself in the middle of a love triangle involving Franchot Tone and Barbara Payton.  Neal ""smashed"" Tone's nose and a scandal ensued.  Neal became poison and no studio would employ him, so he became a gardener and later established a landscaping business.  In 1965 he was accused of murdering his wife.  Able to prove that the gun went off accidentally, Neal had the charges reduced to manslaughter and served a six-year sentence.  He died in 1971.",1088985600,,2370,4.5966587112171835

3616653,5,B001GMS5O4,"1945's Detour is not only one of your truly vintage film noir classics of all-time, it is also ranked by many among the best low-budget films ever made, largely due to the memorable performances of Tom Neal and Ann Savage.  The directorial slant which frames the story is dead on, and one has to think that a larger budget would probably have done more harm than good to this gritty, realistic, film noir tour de force.  Tom Neal plays Al Roberts, one of those unfortunate men who was born both stupid and incredibly unlucky.  Shortly after his girl Sue up and goes to California looking for stardom, Roberts decides to go west and join her, hitchhiking his way across the country.  This one fellow picks him up in Arizona and says he will take him all the way to L.A.; then the guy has the audacity to keel over dead.  Afraid he will be accused of murdering the guy, Roberts decides to hide the body, take the guy's money, and assume his identity until such time as he can ditch the car in a big city.  Then he himself picks up a hitchhiker, a woman who ends up being the last person on earth he would ever have wanted to encounter.  Vera (Savage) know that Roberts is not the man he claims to be, and Roberts quickly finds himself quite at the mercy of this shrew of a woman.  Her greed knows no bounds, and Roberts' life becomes more and more complicated and unhappy by the hour.
Ann Savage's character Vera is perhaps the most blunt, cold, evil, wholly unlikable woman I have ever heard tell of.  It is quite easy to see why the man we meet in the opening scene is as hateful and short-tempered as he is.  As we flash back to the whole story of Roberts' hard times, accompanied by plenty of voiceover narration, one cannot help but feel sorry for the guy.  His initial decision to cover up the death of the guy who picked him up is a bad, undeniably stupid, mistake, but he certainly does not deserve the level of vitriol and pure evil that afflicts him in the form of Vera.  The ending is a tiny bit flat, but the story itself is fascinating and the performances of Neal and Savage are not to be missed.  Detour is vintage film noir and should not be missed by any and all fans of the genre.",1063065600,,2196,4.300970873786408

3616655,4,B001GMS5O4,"`Detour' is either the worst B movie ever made or it's a masterpiece, I can't decide which.  Roger Ebert includes the film in his book `The Great Movies,' yet other critics dismiss it with a laugh.  So which is it?
From the opening, I immediately had my doubts:  Shaky camera work on an already unsteady highway, shots of a stationary car while the background changes, lights going down in a restaurant with the main character's face lit up for a flashback...all cheap B movie stunts, which you expect.
But what you don't expect are good performances.  `Detour' contains at least one good one and one superb one.  Tom Neal plays a piano player from New York hitchhiking to L.A. to meet his sweetheart.  Neal is right on target as the passive loser.  His face looks like it was formed in a vat of perpetual disappointment.  Something happens on his trip to L.A. that makes his life even worse, if that's possible.  Then he meets a woman named Vera.
If they had a Best Actress category for B movies, Ann Savage's portrayal of Vera would be the standard by which all other actresses would be judged.  She's evil, scheming, conniving, wicked, hateful, vengeful...and that's all before breakfast.  Savage multiplies Neal's problems a thousand-fold and grinds the tension out all the way until the end.  With a better script and better production values, Savage and Neal could have lit up the screen for the definitive film noir.  But director Edgar G. Ulmer makes the best use of the limitations he has.  Despite its problems, `Detour' is a better than average B movie/film noir that deserves to be seen.

3616656,3,B001GMS5O4,"Film noir describes Detour well. Everything about this film is dark, from the black and white print shot mostly at night, to the plot, no hope for any of the characters, to the acting, not a smile to be seen among any of the principal actors. Nor is there any reason for smiles in this pessimistic look at the role fate plays in our lives. No exit for anyone caught in this Detour.
Why watch? Movie buffs want to know just what can be done on a shoestring budget when you have a story to tell and a competent cast. Tom Neal and Ann Savage are the couple from hell. Savage is as her name suggests and Neal appears to be too stupid to escape from her threat of going to the police to accuse him of a murder he did not commit while hitching a ride to California.
The story is told in flashback while Neal sits in a roadside diner contemplating his fate. The cost of filming the diner scenes, and the rest of the movie, for that matter, could not have been cheaper. It is fascinating to see what can be done with no money, but a little imagination and a fairly good script.
This film is recommended only for B movie buffs who delight in watching the second half of the bill, when going to the movies meant a feature and filler. Detour is the B side of the show and, as sometimes happens, the throw away is better than the feature.",1047513600,,1326,4.18359375

He is picked up by McDonald who tells him of a female hitchhiker he picked up earlier; she scratched him when he made advances toward her. When it begins to rain, Neal (who is driving while McDonald sleeps) tries to awaken the car's owner in order to put the convertible top up - and finds he's dead.

3616659,5,B001GMS5O4,"Director Edgar G. Ulmer turned out this low budget masterpiece in six shooting days, making ""Detour"" a classic case of an enduring film done in the most economical manner.  Ulmer was the reigning creative head of Producers Releasing Corporation, a Poverty Row studio on Santa Monica Boulevard.  Ulmer spurned offers from majors, preferring instead to operate where he could function as his own man, away from the confining and sharply controlling influences of the big studios, where the bottom line was the essential ingredient.
Martin G. Goldsmith adapted his own screenplay from a highly praised novel which had critics comparing his earthy, ""man against the forces of nature"" style to James M. Cain.  Goldsmith grew up in New York but spent much time during the Depression making his way across the nation, constantly battling for survival.  Having lived the life of the main character, it is understandable why the biting narrative of Tom Neal in ""Detour"" has such a realistic ring, reminding one of some of Robert Mitchum's more somberly existentialist narration from ""Out of the Past.""
Neal starts out in New York playing the piano in a small nightclub, after which he takes to the road, heading for Los Angeles to reunite with his girlfriend nightclub singer, who had gone West to attempt to get into the movies.  Goldsmith knew the terrain and familiarized his audience with it in the film.  While Goldsmith was destined to remain in the world of B screenwriting, he obtained a ""Best Original Screenplay"" Oscar nomination for a film which stands with ""Detour"" as being one of the greatest B noir dramas ever made.  That was the 1952 release, ""The Narrow Margin,"" an RKO film starring Charles McGraw, Marie Windsor and Jacqueline White.  This movie paved the way to a successful career for director Richard Fleischer.
A 1945 release, ""Detour"" has the ring of Depression drama, following not long on the heels of that period of American history.  Neal is determined to reunite with his girlfriend and begins hitchhiking his way to Los Angeles.  He is picked up by a loquacious gambler in Arizona, who, while Neal is driving, sustains a fatal heart attack.  Convinced the police will never accept his account of events, Neal abandons the dead man and takes his wallet along with the better than seven hundred dollars in it, along with his driver's license.  The two men were of the same approximate age, so Neal decides to pass himself off as the deceased man until he gets to Los Angeles, where he intends to reassume his actual identity.
Tough femme fatale Ann Savage foils Neal's plans.  He picks her up after noticing her hitchhiking near a gas station where he has stopped to refuel not long after crossing into California.  Once more Neal is a cruel pawn of fate.  Savage had ridden with the deceased from Shreveport, Louisiana to Arizona, ending her journey after he made a sexual advance on her.  In the ensuing fracas she badly scratched the other man.  Neal had heard that part of the story from the other man not long after getting into his car and noticing the ugly scratches.  The cynical Savage laughs at Neal when he tells her his account of what happened, accusing him of killing the other man.
Eventually Savage tells Neal that she is in control of events.  He moves into an apartment she rents in Hollywood, hoping to shake her after the dead man's car is sold.  When she learns through a newspaper article, however, that the dead man's father is seriously ill and worth fifteen million dollars, she orders Neal to attempt to pass himself off as the man's son, since he had been told that the man had not seen his father since running away from home as a youngster after putting out a playmate's eye.  Neal rebels, insisting that the crazy scheme would never work, and that he had no access to personal information about the dead man, contending he would be tripped up in no time.
The hand of fate deals Neal another stern blow after an argument with Savage.  The heavily drinking woman steps into the bedroom, announcing her intention of calling the police and turning Neal in for murder, angry that he will not act upon her idea to shake money out of the father of the dead man.  She passes out before making the call with the phone cord around her neck.  Neal does not know this since the door is closed.  He instead attempts to pull the cord out of the wall, thinking she is calling the police.  Instead, through fluke circumstances, his efforts result in the accidential death of Savage.
Neal then takes to the road, sadly abandoning his reunion with his girlfriend, wishing her ""happiness"" but realizing that any involvement would be to her disadvantage.  After stepping out into the darkness after having coffee in a diner near Bakersfield, Neal is apprehended after a police car pulls to a stop beside the road.
Goldsmith's brilliant narration contains the desperate ring of a man seeking to survive as long as he can in the most trying circumstances.  Neal realizes he is doing no more than staving off the inevitable for a little while longer.  His is the sad tone of a man who knows that he has been the victim of a merciless fate.",1013126400,,5166,4.747203579418344
3616660,5,B001GMS5O4,"Filmed in 1945 on what looks like a $39 budget does not at all detract from this great slice of cinematic excellence. A great film is a great film regardless of production values. This is a tale of a man caught in the tangled web of fate and his doomed attempt to get himself out. Tom Neal's character hitchikes his way from New York to Los Angeles to be with his girlfriend. His fateful ride comes courtesy of a man who proceeds to die on him in the car. Figuring the police will pin the death on his all too easy to railroad drifter self,he decides to ditch the body and ride on into Los Angeles in the dead man's car. At a gas station he picks up a hitchiking woman who turns out to be his worst nightmare. The hellish Fury of a woman(Ann Savage) strait out of Greek mythology turns out to be a previous hitchiker of the man who keeled over. She recognizes the car and proceeds to threaten blackmail. But she doesn't seem as interested in blackmail as she is torturing the poor man unlucky enough to have met her. Neal's character eventually manages to get away from the beast but the end of his troubles are only beginning as the film comes to a close. Without a doubt one of the most bleak,raw films ever made is made palatable by its short running time,about 65 minutes. This is a film everyone should see at least once. The fact that it doesn't seem so much a movie as it is a private peek into the dirty underbelly of twisted,wasted,insane and hopeless lives makes it a refreshing change of pace from the glamorized grit that usually passes for Hollywood ""realism"".",1009324800,,1573,4.3720136518771335

grace the screen. And anyone can identify with Tom Neal's doomed
character. If you're serious about film noir, you MUST have this
amazing film in your collection. Proof that great films  don't have to cost a mint

3616663,1,B001GMS5O4,"I wasn't all that impressed with this movie, finding it too  self-consciously ""noir-ish"" for its own good. But you know something? I'm going to give it another chance sometime in the future, as I can't help but feel that the reprehensible shape of the print used to make this DVD contributed to my lack of enjoyment of the story. In fact, it's like I haven't even SEEN the whole movie, as entire lines of dialogue were missing every few minutes, accompanied by horrible splices. Trust me, stay away form this particular DVD and wait for someone to release a print of it that's at least watchable.",1000771200,,596,4.622641509433962
3616664,1,B001GMS5O4,"I am a great admirer of ""Detour"" which is probably the best low-budget film noir ever made. But this DVD is a piece of junk. It is transferred from a lousy, battered 35mm print that has badly spliced gaps and screwed-up film footage in crucial scenes, obliterating some of the best dialogue. The company that put this out should be ashamed of itself, especially considering this film is now considered a low-budget masterpiece. If you have no copy of this, get the Sinister Cinema VHS. It is a much higher quality print.",996364800,,520,4.663043478260869
3616665,5,B001GMS5O4,"DETOUR is the ultimate work of art on human fate. ""Wherever you go, fate is stretching his feet to trip you"" says the doomed hero.  Unlike many film noirs and crime movies, the hero is an ""ordinary healthy guy"" as he describes himself, trapped in an extraordinary unhealthy series of situation. In another word, the film is truly chilling because it evokes the frightening sensation that this might happen to myself.
This film has inspired generations of filmmakers from the French new wave to Quentin Tarantino, because it is a masterpiece of low budget esthetics. It is indeed one of the most influential film in film history.
Produced with a next-to-nothing budget and a production schedule of a mere week of shooting, the precision of and ingenuity of Edgar G. Ulmer's direction realized a rich cinematic universe filled with extremely expressive details. Take for instance the way the lighting changes from naturalistic style to a haunting spot-lighting effect on Tom Neal's eyes as he goes into a flashback of his doomed story (a technic that, by the way, Scorsese has stolen so effectively in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE) . Or the cleverness of expressing his nightmarish state of mind simply by shifting the focus of his point of view shot in and out.
Even though it is a low budget film in which it was impossible to hire known actors, the performance is incredible. Tom Neil's haunting voice-over sets up the entire mood so effectively,  and Ann Savage is... well, she is the ultimate femme fatale, so savage and brutal.
Before the DVD release, I had been  able to see the film only with dupy grainy prints and low quality video. But now we have the DVD which is TRANSFERRED FROM THE ORIGINAL CAMERA NEGATIVE. Overall, the image is incredible, so crisp sharp and full of nuances it is difficult to imagine that they shot the film in only a week. But even the original is not in the best shape. A few scenes shows severe deteriorations of the film elements; some shots are distorted and some frames are missing (so it looks like a jump cut). I hope some serious restoration works will be done in the future to correct those flaws, then I'm sure I'll be the first one to buy it.",970704000,,2179,4.669270833333333
3616666,3,B001GMS5O4,"I love the way this story unfolds, in flashback, which is relatively common in film noir.  This story opens with Neal looking back on events as they unfolded, similar to the way Fred MacMurray opens Double Indemnity with his narrative.  The dialogue exchange between Neal and Savage is wonderful too, even hilariously unbelievable at times, like when they first meet.  The only trouble I have with the DVD is that the master was apparently in sad shape.  In more than a few places, it is apparent that this movie is in deperate need of a restoration.  Several scenes have visual noise and thin vertical lines running across the frame.  Even the audio fades and crackles at one point (where Neal and his girlfriend kiss goodbye), which is jarring when one considers this is a DVD.  I do not regret buying this DVD because I love this moive--I only hope that it will be restored one day.",970531200,,885,4.634615384615385
3616667,4,B001GMS5O4,"Come on, it doesn't get cooler than 'Detour'! No budget, no stars, and a wacked-out story of hellish bad luck. Tom Neal is what passes for our hero,  a pianist en route to the coast to meet up with his girl when 'fate sticks  out a foot to trip him'. It's really amazing to see how great this thing  turned out considering how little it had going for it. Watch it at like 3  a.m., when everything is a little foggy, and you'll appreciate it even  more. Then, watch 'D.O.A.', and 'He Walked By Night'.",965606400,,500,4.221052631578948
3616668,5,B001GMS5O4,"'Detour' manages to do in 67 min. what most films dream about in two hours. Made for almost nothing in 5 days by a small-time studio, this goes to show that you don't need money or big studio support to create an  enduring movie. You can sense the tight budget all around. Take into  consideration for example that Ulmer shot a big portion of the film inside  cars (notice how the first few cars have the driver's seat on the left  side, like English automobiles), a cheap nightclub and a creaky apartment.  Also in the flashback sequence when Tom Neal is sitting in the restaurant,  Ulmer simply put out the lights, made a close-up on Neal's face and shed a  rectangular light onto his eyes to create the flashback effect. All this  techniques, while not very innovative, add to the effect of this bleak  little gem. A dark little drama that is deserving of it's cult following.  Tom Neal is the ultimate screen chump as an innocent man who happens to  land on Ann Savage's deadly lap. Ann Savage creates one of the most  ruthless characters ever to grace the silver screen, her character doesn't  have a shred of human kindness or decency, she's tough, greedy, ruthless  and relentless. It has all the elements of great noir; a truly memorable  femme fatale, dark foggy streets, acid-stingy dialogue and a hero who gets  his just desserts. A dark little gem that deserves to be discovered by noir  fans. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!",964483200,,1449,4.554263565891473
3616669,5,B001GMS5O4,"As soon as Al Roberts's (Tom Neal) doleful face appears in the opening minutes of Detour, viewers can readily suspect that he is in deep trouble. Told in a narrative voiceover, Detour (1944) epitomizes the tragic  innocence of a protagonist trapped in a conspiratorial entanglement of  deceit. Al Roberts is one of the most empathetic figures ever to apear in a  noir film.  Roberts justifies his unlawful actions by convincing  viewers  that the truth will only bring him unjustifiable punishment.  Ann Savage as  Vera gives an unforgetable performance as the most cantankerous dame ever  to appear in a black and  white film.  Within the genre of noir, Vera's  deviousness and quest for manipulative control are unparalled. Both  alluring and repulsive, Vera strikes out at Al's weakness and exploits his  vunerability with the skill of a poker player holding a full house against  two  pair. Operating with a sneering face and an unflattering voice, Vera's  powerful feminine instincts pounce on Al's weakened masculinity.  With a  tight script, bounded by Vera's caustic lines-(Shad up, your making noise  like a husband); Detour convincingly moves through its skeptical plot  structure.  Director Edgar G. Ulmer should be praised for establishing the  excellent timing of the dialogue exchanges between Vera and Al.  Savage's  lines are delivered with snap and laced with vinegar.  Sometimes Savage  crowds Neal's responses with her leads, but that is thankful, since Neal's  delivery is often bland and weak.  But then again, what is a guy to do when  a girl you just met wants to frame you for murder and says: ""I'd hate  to see a fella as young as you wind up sniffing that perfume that Arizona  hands out free to murderers"" With a minimal budget to work from, Ulmer  maximized his limited resources.  The scenes in the diner, jazz club, and  hotel room, ooze with noir realism. Al and girlfriend Sue's (Claudia Drake)  night-time stroll along Riverside Drive was cleverly filmed. Detour is the  king of B noir films. Why actress Ann Savage never attained major roles in  other notable noir films is mystfying. Does anyone know the make and model  of the  convertible  used in the film?  Also since reviewers at this site  are not allowed to discuss film endings, does anyone know the significance  of the police patrol car at the final fade out?  I have my own theory.",961545600,,2377,4.966751918158568
3616670,5,B001GMS5O4,"I saw this in the middle of the night on cable more than 10 years ago and still haven't forgotten it.  This may be the most despairing noir ever made.  According to this, we are all just playthings in the hands of a  sadistic god.  But there's a kind of gallows humor in the movie that is  perversely entertaining.  The Tom Neal character is such a sad sack that he  is more than a little responsible for bringing catastrophe on himself.  And  what catastrophe!  It becomes so bad that it resembles a sick, shaggy-dog  joke.  And facing up the the worst in literature and film, if done with wit  and compassion, is always cathartic.  This is a stinky little gem.",961113600,,662,4.408333333333333

Since the other reviews cover the plot and style,all I have to say is that what makes this movie great for me is that  it has a quality similar to a Greek tradgedy. Is it the woman or a weakness  in himself that dooms him? You can see the hero's doom rushing to  inevitably meet him,and he rushing to meet it,yet you hope he can somehow  avoid it. Will he? That's the question that keeps you nailed to your seat.

8306140,2,B001GMS5O4,"Detour, 1945 film

The film opens on a lonely two-lane blacktop highway. Its geography suggests southern California. A man walks along the highway until he gets a ride. The juke box plays a big record, the tune brings back memories. We see what happened before to Al the piano player. A long distance call is handled by dozens of operators. Al hitchhikes across country to Los Angeles. One man, Charles Haskell, picks him up and tells about his past life. Then something goes terribly wrong. Al switches clothes and takes Haskell's identification, then drives to California. Al picks up a woman by a gas station, Vera is going to Los Angeles. Later there is a surprise from Vera! She is trouble.

Vera and Al register as Mr. & Mrs. Charles Haskell. ""I'm always right."" Their conversation tells about their characters. They don't sell the car. They dine at a drive-in diner. Vera has big ideas. The monetary figures date this film. An argument results in more bad luck for Al. He leaves, but an unforeseen event occurs to end this story.

A better script could improve this low-budget story. The idea of impersonation of a stranger was used in other films and stories. If Vera was thrown out of Haskell's automobile why would she return to it? It does teach of the problems that come from making a wrong decision (picking up a stranger hitchhiker).",1474070400,,1347,4.723404255319149
