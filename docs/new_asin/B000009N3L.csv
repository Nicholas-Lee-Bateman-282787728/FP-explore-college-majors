7905615,5,B000009N3L,"Very smooth and creepy, with solid acting all around. A dark film in every way with a haunting beautiful sound track featuring a song that really must be redone with modern sound recording, ""Ni deng zhe huei lai"" [...]. Unfortunately neither the movie or the song is available in a good format.",1362096000,,294,4.673076923076923
7905616,5,B000009N3L,"Ok, the first time I saw this movie I was really scared. This is a ghost story that is suspenseful and disturbing to say the least. The director was able to bring out great performances from all the actors/actresses. A definite thumbs up for someone who likes scary movies.",1039651200,,273,4.591836734693878
