1889905,3,B00009RXI7,"Onmyoji is a fair film which really deserves 3 1/2 stars but is not quite a four.
The plot takes place during the Japanese Heian period, where demons and ghosts can envoke havoc on the living.  The havoc in Onmoyoji ranges from slight to down right scary when two Onmoyoji are pitted against each other for control of the imperial city.  This battle is brought on by Doson, an Onmoyoji, who wishes to take control of the city anyway he can.  He starts by using slight manipulation and treachery before he turns to an all out onslaught of evil spirits to do his bidding.  Seimei, another Onmoyoji, is recruited by Hiromasa to battle theses disturbances of the ghostly invaders.  Together they unravel a plot of betrayal and trechary, and it's ultimately the combined powers of both which is needed to try and save the day.
The plot and idea of Onmyoji was an exceptional one.  The  political intrigue element adds a lot of intelligence to the story and makes the characters plights interesting.  Also, the friendship between Seimei and Hiromasa adds a Sherlock Holmes type element to the story which is easy to appreciate.  There are also plenty of interesting characters including a demi-god who hangs out with Seimei and can turn into a butterfly, and a guardian of a tomb who can suck in, and spit out evil spirtis as a favor to Seimei.  Seimei and Doson also use lots of magical tricks throughout the movie which gives ample opprotunity to use CGI effects.  (some of the best I've seen in a Japanese production)
After all that praise why only 3 1/2 stars?  Mainly because Omnyoji fails to seize opportunities to add more action to the movie.  Especially towards the end, when the city is being taken over by ghostly foes. More action would have hit the spot.  Overall though, Onmyoji is worth a watch.  The cinematograhpy, costuming, and special effects will probabally be enough to hold your attention. You will probabally have to watch it twice to take in the whole story, due to the complicated-ness of the plot, but you'll notice things the second time around that you may have brushed off the first time.  Seimei is nothing else if not deliberate.  (You'll see what I mean)
Note:  This film is not like the Vampire Hunting movies in Hong Kong Cinema.  It's not particularly scary, and the battle with the spirits is minimal.  This is more of a Japanese fantasy with mystery and intrigue.  Keep that in mind while viewing it.",1061769600,2,2432,4.688679245283019
1889906,4,B00009RXI7,"I first stumbled across information about this movie while researching the religious background behind the art of Onmyo (Onmyodo).  Having previously read several of Abe no Seimei's stories, I was excited to see that this movie came out in the U.S. Taking place in the Heian era, this movie follows the story of the onmyoji Abe no Seimei and court noble Minamoto no Hiromasa.  It is a tale of court intrigue and relationships between characters.  The reason it interested me is that there was a large focus on Onmyodo as well, going into the background of this tradition; the spells, curses, divination, talismans and chanting.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see some of the traditional tales of Abe no Seimei adapted into the movie.
The only complaint that I have with the DVD release is that the sound quality could have been better.  I noticed that toward the end of the later DVD chapters, the sound sync started getting a little behind the video.
Like with many Japanese movies, the emphasis is not on action. This is opposite of a good portion of American films.  Some might find that it is a slow-paced movie and that the acting and special effects are ""not up to par"" with American movies.  However, this movie is very much colored with rich culture, as well as deep character relationships and emotions. I think that anyone with an interest in Japanese court culture or magico-religious beliefs would enjoy this movie immensely. It is also a great movie for most anyone in general, unless you get queasy at the site of blood. There isn't a large amount of blood, but there is a scene or two that probably aren't for the weak-stomached.",1061078400,27,1649,4.724738675958188

1889955,4,B00009RXI7,"Ok. I'm going to be as honest as I can be. I've always had a fascination with Japanese culture. This movie is set in Heian Japan, and is a fantasy movie. It's sort of like Harry Potter set in ancient Japan, but with adult protagonists. As some other reviewers have said, it can have a B-movie quality at times. In fact, for the first 15 minutes, i burst out laughing multiple times because of this. But, once you get used to it, it's a great movie. The costumes, the culture...it really is a cool movie once you acclimate yourself to it. If you are interested in ancient Japanese culture and myths, this movie is really worth it. And as I was watching it, I thought this would really be a fun movie for kids to see....BUT, it does have some pretty gruesome depictions of death, such as a corpse laying in a riverbed, that would not be suitable for children under 12.",1325894400,,866,4.351851851851852

1889976,4,B00009RXI7,"I have been a great admirer of Japanese art and films for half a century.  This film fell a little short of the mark, but it's still worth seeing.  The dubbing is truly horrific.  I would prefer to have listened to the Japanese and read subtitles than to hear really ordinary Hollywood voices.  This was definitely not Masterpiece Theatre quality dubbing.  You see gorgeous costumes and elegant courts and then hear people speaking the most common sort of American English, like ""he's a good fellow"" which sounds idiotic, not to mention how totally lacking in culture the voices are.

This alone would be cause for seriously downgrading the rating, but the editing is a bit incoherent at times and some things lacked credibility, like the five-pointed stars.  Still, the film has merits and is capable of triggering some interesting reflection.",1313798400,,844,4.985714285714286

1889980,5,B00009RXI7,"Abe no Seimei...
dear lovers of magical movies,
... was a real magician of Heian period Japan. There is a temple built in his honor in Kyoto. He practiced Onmyoji, a form of magic and astrology based upon the Chinese Yin-Yang and five elements system. The acting in this film, particularly of the lead character, is a bit stylized, but, we feel works well with his interpretation of the character, as well as, traditional Japanese theater.
  The story itself is the usual good vs. evil, save the realm from rising darkness, but there is a reason this mythology is so often repeated and it is the same reason Buffy needed to save the world every season. It is because it works for dramatic tension and it works because it speaks to our own psyches and our hunger for a solution to the darkness rising in our modern world.
  But more importantly, this is a wonderful movie about magic and it delighted us. If you love movies about the occult, and you love to see evil get its butt kicked, then you may love this movie and its sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Onmyoji-II/dp/B0002IQHAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Onmyoji II</a>, as much as we did.

1889981,5,B00009RXI7,"A story taking place during a period of japanese history not usually seen in japanese movies (about 1000 years ago). Beautiful costumes, but the special effects are a bit crude.  Overall though, a well done movie.",1233532800,,213,4.916666666666667
1889982,4,B00009RXI7,"Abe no Seimei is sort of the Japanese equivalent of Merlin. He lived a thousand years ago, was an onmyodo pecialist, and was supposed to have been the offspring of a man and a fox demon.

So it's not exactly surprising that ""Onmyoji"" is soaked in fantasy, with shapeshifting butterflies, ghosts, immortals, evil sorcerers, demons and armies of ogres. It has some distinctly hokey special effects (is that a feathered Muppet?), but the complex plot is kept afloat by solid direction, and some truly brilliant acting from Mansai Nomura as the foxy lead character.

Heian-era Japan is infested with demons, monsters and spirits, which are regularly dealt with by the Onmyoji (sort of astrologer/sorcerers). The greatest of these: Abe no Seimei, whose magical heritage gives him a distinct advantage over his fellows.

Hiromasa no Minomoto (Hideaki Ito) is initially nervous when he's sent to fetch Seimei, for some friend who is being haunted by an angry ghost. But the earnest young nobleman is impressed by Seimei's power, insight and deft handling of delicate cases. So when the emperor's newborn son is suddenly possessed by a demon, Hiromasa immediately comes to Seimei for help.

With the help of a strange immortal woman, Seimei saves the day. But his archrival Doman (Hiroyuki Sanada) is still working behind the scenes, using spells and demons in assassination attempts, and even trying to have Seimei arrested for treason. And despite his immense power, even Seimei does not suspect the malignant magics that Doman is going to use....

Though it has a lot of the trappings of cliche fantasy -- evil sorcerers, vengeful ghosts, a plucky young hero -- ""Onmyoji"" is a pretty unique experience. It's soaked in Japanese folklore, costumes and history, but at its heart it's really just about the growing friendship between two very different men, and the ways that Hiromasa's innocent outlook affects the jaded, languid Seimei.

Obviously for that, you need some excellent actors, and Nomura gives a mischievous, lazily sly performance as the vaguely vulpine Seimei. But he can handle more dramatic scenes, such as Seimei's childlike panic when Hiromasa is shot. And Ito plays the naive Hiromasa as a young, romantic, idealistic nobleman (also loosely based on a real person), whose bright personality is enough to endear him to Seimei. By the climax, their odd friendship feels real and solid.

And director Yojiro Takita does an excellent job bringing this slow-moving storyline to life. Juggling fantasy, horror, romance and political intrigue at a slow pace isn't an easy task, but Takita manages it quite well. He unwinds the plot slowly, peppering it with lots of supernatural plots and nasty little ghoulies and ghosties. But about three-thirds of the way through the plot, things suddenly pick up -- and we're in for battle scenes and magical duels.

And Takita has an eye for bringing medieval Japan alive -- he weaves in scenes of pure beauty (Hiromasa playing his flute for his melancholy ""lady of the moon"") in with the horror. And that horror is pretty diverse -- we have everything from a lady ghost cuddling her ex to the exorcism of a veiny many-headed scarlet demon in Seimei's garden. Even odder, all this is handled in a matter-of-fact way, as if there's nothing too unusual about hauntings and demons.

Problems? Well, some of the special effects are terribly hokey, such as Doman's feathered familiar (hello, animatronics!) and the corkscrew ogre fangs. When one character started chewing on Hiromasa with those funky teeth, it was hard not to laugh.

""Onmyoji"" suffers from some distinctly silly special effects, but the bulk of this solid fantasy movie is all good -- lots of Japanese folklore, a touch of horror, and a very foxy anti-hero.",1213747200,2,3765,5.048309178743962

I think it is so much better than the sequel, Onmyoji II, and do not understand why it received an inferior rating. This film has a touch of the fantasy seen in ""Crouching Tiger"", but this movie has a happy ending! (and is Japanese).

The cinematography is excellent, the costumes are phenomenal, the story line is heart-rending with multiple love stories intertwined, mixed with power struggles and the supernatural.  What more could one ask for?

I love this film a little more each time I see it, and whole heartedly recommend it to anyone.",1159488000,3,631,4.761467889908257
1889995,5,B00009RXI7,"This is obviously not a movie for everyone.  If you go into this movie expecting it to be like a western fantasy movie then you'll be disappointed.

As a number of other reviewers have pointed out. This movie is meant to be stylized, there are many references to traditional Japanese dramatic styles (including both Kyogen and Noh) particularly in the manner in which the characters act.

Translating classical genres into modern contexts such as the monster movie is always a bit fraught. On balance I liked what director Takita Yojiro did with this movie despite it's clunkiness for the modern viewer.

The stand out for me was the acting.  Nomura Mansai was particularly good as Abe no Seimei.  I thought his ""foxy"" persona was spot on. I also liked Ito Hideaki's flute-playing nobleman sidekick. The two of them have great rapport together.

For people interested in Japanese culture there are several other really interesting aspects to the movie (as pointed out to me by my colleague Alex Golub of Golublog and Savage Minds fame):

Firstly, the whole issue of where demons come from and how to destroy them.  This revolves around the issue of social harmony. When harmony in relationships is upset through anger, envy, jealousy or whatever, the negative emotions create the demonic aspect of the person which then takes on a life of its own. Exorcising the demon primarily involves the restoration of harmonious relationships (and not the intervention of ""good"" as is the case in Christian understandings of exorcism).

The other interesting aspect of the movie to me was the way in which magic is a function of words and movement performed properly.  For me, the climatic fight scene was great because it was so clearly NOT about weapons skills or direct combat at all, but rather the use of spiritual skill and intelligence.  Seimei's laying out of the pentagram was a marvellous peice of film-making and captured the spirit of East Asian martial arts philosophy beautifully.

The last example of something thought-provoking in the movie I'll give (though by no means the last thing in the movie) was the way in which the director forced you to confront the boundaries between the real and the ""unreal"": the use of paper dolls and butterflies as the ""real"" forms of Seimei's women servants (and at one point, himself) was a great example of this, and added layers of meaning to other instances of this motif in other Japanese films. For novices to Japanese cinema like myself, a good example would be the paper birds that attack Haku the dragon in Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"".

Overall, I liked this movie a great deal. It's worth seeing in its own right but as a way to learn more about traditional Japanese culture, it's worth even more stars.",1138492800,,2752,4.877682403433476
1889996,3,B00009RXI7,"There's an evil prince and a good prince, aided and abetted by evil and good wizards.  Butterflies turn into beautiful maidens.  Beautiful maidens either live forever young (forget it - got to eat merman sushi to qualify), turn into delicate paper dolls, or, if the wizard is prankish, turn back into butterflies.

  Our hero, Hiromasa, is a young, junior grade wizard, a wise man in waiting, an onmyoji in ONMYOJI.  Spends most of his time playing flute solos in front of closed carriage of a mopishly beautiful, eternally youthful maiden.  Falls in love with her, apparently by osmosis - how do you fall in love with a sigh machine, anyway?  Hiromasa's boss is Seimei, a yin-yang master of the complex spells with a strange sense of humor who may, or may not, help the Mikado when his newborn son is threatened by the evil machinations of boss bad wizard Doson.

 With plenty of supernatural elements, the plot is both busy and superficial.  The characters are pretty shallow, and production values are campishly low. There's a supernatural bird and a sick animatronic baby that look like they were purchased at a dollar store.  ONMYOJI recalls the spirit, if not the particulars, of the old Gene Autry and Roy Rogers programmers of my Saturday morning television youth.  No central love story, or much graphic violence.  Target audience, adolescents. With its indifferent acting, stylized and unambitious action it seems more or less the same as those bygone cookie cutter westerns.  Some of the special effects are laughably bad.

 ONMYOJI was comfortably interesting, an unusual flight of fantasy.  Good Saturday morning fare, safe for the whole family.",1132790400,,1658,5.010989010989011
1889997,4,B00009RXI7,"Abe no Seimei is a legendary figure from Japanese history, a sort of Merlin figure with an authentic historical basis.  A master of the art of Onmyo-do, a Yin-Yang sorcery based on prevailing scientific theory and Chinese mysticism, Abe no Seimei was a hero of stories factual and fanciful.  Reputed to be the son of a Fox spirit, he worked as an Onmyoji to the Emperor, casting spells and advising on the spiritually correct way to handle affairs.  His arch-enemy, the Onmyoji Ashiya Doman, is a jealous figure who seeks to embarrass and undermine the popular Seimei.

This latest interpretation of his story, ""Onmyoji,"" sees Abe no Seimei as an attractive, almost rock-star type of figure. In a world of mysterious spirits and invading demons, he is the unrivaled master of magic.  Ever at his shadow is the scheming Douson (instead of Doman, for some reason).  In this movie, Douson arranges the stealing of a sacred sword,  placed in trust of a mis-used spirit a century ago, in order to pacify his anger and make him a guardian of the capitol city, in keeping with Shinto beliefs.  The theiving of the sword creates an angry army of the dead, and only Abe no Seimei and his stalwart companion Minamoto no Hiromaki to defend.

""Onmyoji"" is a showcase for actor Mansai Nomura, who is often miscredited as a Noh performer but is actually an actor of Kyogen, a traditional expressive form of Japanese comedic theater.  Nomura has one previous film credit, in Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" but ""Onmyoji"" is a much greater platform for his Kyogen-honed skills, including the various foxy glances and smiles that exude the supernatural parentage of Abe no Seimei.

Not a great film, ""Onmyoji"" seems unsure of itself as either a theatrical film of a television series.  The major action is segmented into 30 minute episodes, so it could easily be broadcast as a TV miniseries.  The special effects on on par with an average Japanese supernatural TV series, so it leads me to believe that a theatrical release was not the original intention.  Previous incarnations of Abe no Seimei have been TV programs, so it isn't unlikely.

On the plus side, Nomura's acting is enough to carry the show, although the over-the-top style of Kyogen might be off-putting to some American viewers.  The story is Grand Opera, end of the world type of stuff, with plenty of room for personal sacrifice and pathos and all the other goodies that one expects from this type of flick.

A perfectly entertaining film, although there is certainly room for improvement.  However, as time has shown, this will not be the last time that Abe no Seimei makes a screen appearance.  His story has lasted for over a thousand years.  It will last a bit longer.",1118966400,22,2709,4.797413793103448
1889998,4,B00009RXI7,"Onmmyoji is a terrific little Japanse film. First, if you don't like Japanese fantasy then you won't enjoy it but if you're willing to just relax and go with it, the movie is a lot of fun.

You have a court appointed wizard who'se job is to protect the emperor and his family. Where did he come from and how old is he really are not known. You have a good hearted but bumbling Watson like buddy and you have a the wizard's assistant who is not human and functions as a witches cat or a living magic wand. Oh and you have a villain who has a huge beef, destroys property and kills a lot of hapless extras and a of course you have a bounty of lovely ladies.

By the end of the movie I learned that if you are brave but stupid it's really good to have a wizard for a best friend becuase he's there to repeatedly save you and attempt to educate you.

Villains take a good ten minutes to laugh about their evil plans so you should take your shot while they're occupied.

Wizards never answer direct questions so don't even try asking.

If you're going to fall in love find a woman who has nothing to do with the emperor and move fast becuase she might be dead before the final reel.

Onmyoji is a popcorn and beer movie. It's highly amusing without scads of graphic violence, sex or hidden agendas. Give it a look see.",1107648000,5,1313,4.169960474308301
1889999,5,B00009RXI7,"Onmyoji is notable both a period piece and an example of the Japanese taste in tales of the magical and monstrous. A jealous woman and a greedy counselor seek to end the power of another courtesan and take the life of the newborn prince. They enlist Doson, one of the Onmyoji - scholar mages whose duty is supposedly to protect the Mikado. Doson has another agenda - he is determined to bring the Mikado down, but his spells are repeatedly brought to nothing by the actions of Minamoto no Hiromaki and the brilliant sage Seimei. Confrontations continue to escalate until all of Heiyan Kyo (which will become Kyoto in another life) is at the brink of becoming a demon kingdom.

While it is easy to summarize the film in a paragraph, what stands out is Director Yojiro Takita's ability to take this story out of the monster movie genre and give it the trapping and movements of traditional Japanese theater. The film's settings are remarkable, as are the costumes and makeup. It's a bit like looking at an old story scroll. Japanese magic depends on chant, gesture, and dance as well as spells written on paper. Is it all authentic? I don't know, but it is easy to imagine that it is so.  And on the screen, all the ritual takes on a life of its own.

I think at least some of the perception of campiness that viewers feel is due to the high fantasy approach that Yojiro Takita has adopted.  Characters develop very little outside of the friendship of Hiromaki and Seimei. These are characters in masks, following a set of carefully circumscribed actions, much as if Noh drama had been translated into this century. I found it very enjoyable, but not particularly deep. There is enough though so that the film will certainly bear up under rewatching. And anime fans will see parallels all over the place. Think of it as a confection to set before the Mikado.",1103241600,10,1856,4.598187311178248
1890000,5,B00009RXI7,"Even upon multiple viewings, this movie never fails to delight.  Anyone who enjoys Japanese film, especially of an historical, magical bent, cannot help but like these characters---a court magician who feels no need to compete and is almost cranky when enjoined to take a stand against a fellow omiyogi who is power-hungry and villianous to boot.  The enjoiner is a rather minor court noble, who is pure of heart, yet not particularly brave until he is called upon to be a guardian of the city.  Add to this various court ladies who are either magical, cursed, or immortal (and even a pair of doomed, star-crossed lovers) and we have quite a pleasing mixture.

It is beautifully photographed, scored (especially the flute and celestial music), and costumed; therefore, taking all of the above into account, I was forgiving of some less than spectacular special effects.

I particularly like the dance sequence which brings one character to life, at the willing sacrifice of another.  Since the dancer, Seimei is a renowned Noh dancer---no wonder he was so impressive.

I look forward to the lift in spirits that this movie has always given me and I will watch it often.",1101686400,21,1169,4.903553299492386
1890001,4,B00009RXI7,I have no idea what these people are complaining about. This movie is exactly what it was meant to be. Saying this is campy is like saying Excalibur was campy. It's a fantasy movie. I thought the wire acting was a little old-school and the butterfly woman was goofy but it was a pretty good movie through and through. I would only recommend buying it to true lovers of fantasy and Japanese movies but most other could rent it and enjoy it.,1075075200,11,439,4.365853658536586
1890002,2,B00009RXI7,"The question here is if you can get past the campiness of this particular rendition.  I originally purchased this while at Kinokuniya because I loved the miniseries version of the whole Abe no Seimei legends from (I think) Fuji Television.  Although that production had a lower budget, I found that it was better written and soundly produced with better acting for an overall rather good retelling of these fun and compelling sword & sorcery epics from the Heian period.
I had several problems with this rendition.  Overall I liked it mostly because I love old tales of the Onmyoji, and I felt that although the treatment of the story was almost Godzilla featurette-esque.  Seimei appears here as a omniscient superhero complete with smiling arms-akimbo stance a la those old black & white Superman serials save for the foppish, girlish demeanor given to Seimei by the actor who plays him.
Overall, if you're not looking for a Kurosawa-esque voyage of cinematic mastery, you might like Onmyoji as long as you liked ""Creature Double Feature"" on Channel 56 when you were younger.",1073692800,8,1077,4.966666666666667
1890003,4,B00009RXI7,"In order to appreciate this movie, you have to know that the whole Onmyoji story is not just written by someone for this
time.  It is based on a true story(!) in 8th Century Japan.
The charactors and stories are from the one of the oldest records written in Japanese.  Those guys were existed then, doing those miracles in daily life.
It is so interesting to learn about Japanese beliefs and religious activities in old times, which lead us to understand what the bases of them today.
Also, you should know that the main actor is a ""prince"" of ""NOH Dance"" which is one of the most ancient art forms in Japan.
This is why his movment is not at all like other actors but with a special NOH technique.
Overall, this is really a great Japanese movie. Should be more introduced to foreign countries since it represents depth and difference of their culture.",1072828800,32,852,4.525974025974026

Mansai Nomura is great as the great aloof onmyoji, Abe no Seimei, and Hiroyuki Sanada is a the perfect villian as Dosan!",1434326400,3,282,4.423076923076923
