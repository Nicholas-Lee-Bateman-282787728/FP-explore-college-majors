212214,3,6300181847,"This classic early '50s Sci-Fi romp influenced a generation of writers and film-makers, not so much from what it was but what it promised and fell short of.
In fairness, This Island Earth is quite a good movie for its  time.  Unfortunately, repeated viewings only hold up as an unintended  comedy.  The early scenes of the film, with their overtones of cold war  espionage and shady goings-on are both interesting and effective.  Exeter,  the alien hero, is likeable and oddly believeable.  However, once the film  moves into outer space and becomes true science fiction, it's like trying  to walk on a sliding board with greased shoes.  While the premise of a  beseiged planet struggling to survive is plausible and sympathetic, the  combination of poorly done matte paintings, exploding raisins on strings  and bipedal lobster sentries is just a bit too much.
When watching this  movie, enjoy it for what it is and resist the temptation to compare it with  modern science fiction.  Remember, it's a classic of its time.",944697600,16,1021,4.946745562130178

It keeps you intrigued from the introductory scene where a jet plane is saved from crashing on burn out and we see a mysterious light on the plain as it is brought to a save landing.

Later while ordering electronic parts for a project Dr. Cal Meacham (Rex Reason), receives a unique catalog that would not raise an eyebrow in today's market. The pages were made of metal and the products are miniature electronics not anywhere near today's circuitry.

While hiding from their hosts prying eyes a small group of invited scientists notice that the live in cat could tell that they were being scanned. This was probably the original ""CAT scan.""

Russell Johnson has this thing for islands. First, there is ""This Island Earth"" then there is ""Gilligan's Island"" and my favorite island with him on it is in ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" (1957) where he gets his tubes eaten.

Never dreamt as a kid I'd have a perfect copy years later to watch over and over. Great G/PG rated fun that you can watch w your nieces and nephews and not scare them to death.

212482,4,6300181847,"1. A superb under appreciated 1950s era science fiction classic. Great plot line, cheesy looking monster creature. Love the whole mysterious interociter fabrication angle...
The movie is crying for a modern, intelligent, science fiction remake. Regrettably  the previous sentence is an oxymoron. These days it seems that in the movie industry we have great special effects capabilities, but script writers that only cater to adolescents to make the film industry money. They are completely unaware of the incredible goldmine of script ideas to be found in 1940s-60s science fiction. I can count intelligent movies of this genre on one hand. (Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey, Scott's Blade Runner, and Spielberg's Minority Report come to mind...)
2. NOT 5 STARS RATED BECAUSE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO (anamorphic*) MULTI REGION BLU RAY DVD OF THIS FILM. This would be a great companion piece to the excellent Blu Ray remake of Forbidden Planet...

212497,3,6300181847,"This is one of those films I read about in Famous Monsters of Filmland, but never had a chance to see.  It looks fun and you get an inkling that it might be hard scifi, but in fact it is just a 50s formula flick.  I must say, I was disappointed.

I will try to avoid spoilers.  The film starts out well:  a great scientist is enticed to join a mysterious research cooperative, filled with taciturn colleagues, with one of whom he had formed an old romantic attachment.  What the ""sponsors"" are doing is a mystery, and they have unusual technology as well as a somewhat menacing mean with their strange appearance.  There is one who seems reasonable, but the other is more sinister.  What ensues is kind of fun and there are some interesting ideas thrown in, but in the end it degenerates into a monster chase instead of developing the promising themes more thoroughly.  The ending is too abrupt, like they ran out of budget and got lazy.

This is the kind of thing I grew up watching.  No doubt, I would have loved it as a kid.  But it is not for hard scifi fans, who have much much better 50s films to choose from, e.g. Forbidden Planet or The Day the Earth Stood Still, both of which are absolutely first rate.",1443398400,2,1212,4.337777777777778

Out of all of them, This Island Earth, if you can appreciate the concept of the story, is perhaps the most imaginative of them all.

The film starts with a scientist trying to extract energy from a nuclear source -- something that the 50s movies all were obsessed with. The lab gets a sample of some small beads that were supposed to take the place of a huge condenser, normally designed for this kind of amperage. In this case, the small beads outperform anything they'd ever used. Yes, it's a story for people who enjoy geeky science, but because of that it's an intelligent film that gradually unfolds one mystery after another. They eventually receive a book of plans to build a device called an interociter, a device that acts as a communication system as well as an incredibly destructive laser force. The story diverts to a private home miles away from anything else, where a select group of scientists are all working to solve the problem of developing an energy source. They later reveal this is for the home planet of the beings that enlisted them, some of which are ruthless while the main character is more benign. It's a film that includes space travel, science, intrigue and some goofy looking aliens, but for the most part this is one of the most imaginative films made in those early years, and a must-have in anyone's DVD collection. I don't know why it hasn't been remade. It deserves far more attention.",1442448000,,1587,4.667857142857143

212517,3,6300181847,"I love cheesy old science fiction films, and I am generally willing to put up with a lot of flaws. This Island Earth was a big hit at the time because of its special effects and beautiful color print, and the acting's not bad either--a cut above most period ""B"" movie outings. So why am I so lukewarm about it? The plot is non-existent and the main characters don't get to do anything except witness stuff other people do. No one in the film has any effect on its outcome, and characters periodically do nonsensical things apparently just to create ""conflict"" or ""action.""
<<SPOILER ALERT>>
The hero gets a mysterious summons to a remote research facility and upon arrival meets an old flame who insists they have never met before. OOO! MYSTERY! Within an hour or so she admits that yes, she is who he thought. Why pretend she wasn't? No real reason beyond, ""We have to be careful."" or something like that, and then lets everyone know they are old friends. The host (pretty obviously not from around here) entertains them and says he's brought the top scientists in the world together to work on this special project. The hero and the girl escape that night, the research facility blows up killing all the other scientists the aliens brought together, and then the hero and girl are captured by the aliens and taken back to Metaluna (their home planet) to help defend them against evil(well, MORE evil) invading aliens. Why blow up the lab and all the other scientists (aside from the obvious reason that they wanted a big dramatic explosion)? The alien has decided the hero and girl are the smartest and so didn't need the other after all. (That makes sense. Get six or eight of the top scientists on Earth together and kill all but the top two. I mean, what use could the others have possibly been?) They get to Metaluna and the Big Boss Alien wants to turn them into mind slaves, but their pal, the Alien who brought them, thinks that's immoral. (Huh? After killing all the others because he had no further use for them?) He helps the hero and girl escape and flies them off in his ship just as the defenses are collapsing and Metaluna is destroyed (so notice that even his whole project was a wasted effort from the start, as there was never enough time for these Earth Scientists to even see the inside of a lab before everything went pear-shaped). There's a thing with a ""Mutant monster"" but it's just to show off the mutant suit and manufacture a few more cheap thrills which have nothing to do with the plot. Alien Pal gets them back to Earth, sends them on their way, and blows up his ship and himself--for no articular reason, but that's pretty much par for the course in this film.

Given it's good features, why does this plot stuff grate so much with me? Because the film is so deadeningly pretentious. ""Look at us!"" it demands, ""We're making SERIOUS science fiction."" No, you're not. It's just stupid crap dressed up to look serious. There are 1950's science fiction films out there made on much smaller budgets, with less-talented actors, and far fewer pretensions to being ""quality,"" but which actually manage to find room for things like character arc, real conflict, tough moral choices, failure and redemption, and solutions generated by the protagonists. You will look and look for anything like that in THIS ISLAND EARTH and come away empty.

I gave it three stars. I was feeling generous.

Notice that at no time in the film do either of the two main characters have any effect on anything. They could as easily have been played by inflatable dummies the alien hauls around from place to place and periodically delivers his long, weird speeches to.",1438128000,3,3670,4.634408602150538

My old worn out vhs copy of this movie looks superior to this dvd transfer. It's as if someone decided let's put this on dvd pulled the film and transferred it with no regard to quality. Parts of this film look terrible compared to the old vhs the scene in the fog is the worst of it. The stock footage at the beginning has always looked bad, but even the parts when Cal is flying the jet look terrible. This is such a classic I just cannot believe they did such a poor job, it's criminal.

TDTESS and TIE were both inspired by published science fiction stories, while FP was adapted from Shakespeare's The Tempest, of all things! Of all 3 , THIS ISLAND EARTH is the most fun.

I watched it for the first time this afternoon and found it entertaining and well done for the time and considerably better than I expected it to be considering it was made in 1954.

This is the story of an alien race that has secretly come to earth for help in their very survival as a species. They lure a group of scientists unknowingly to their cause by dangling advanced science before them as bait. This is the story of two of the earth scientists who were trapped and taken into space.

The story was well paced and held my interest from beginning to end; while certain aspects of the movie were dated the overall effect is very good. If you're a sci-fi fan and have somehow managed to miss this one you owe it to yourself to either rent it or buy it; if you're a collector you'll probably want to buy it because it does make a noteworthy addition to any sci-fi film collection along with other movies of that time frame like War of the Worlds, and Forbidden Planet.",1381622400,3,1098,4.351219512195122

212728,4,6300181847,"This is not a bad 1950'S Sci-Fi movie. The book was much better, however. And the movie would have been better if it had stuck more closely to the original story.

And the story is very original.

But the movie, for some reason strays from the book about 1/2 through. It's not bad but the orginal story was far better.

Inviting the geniuses and testing them (ie building the intercociter, etc) was the best part of the film. Once they took the main leads prisoners the movie started to stall a little. It wasn't bad - just not as good. The scenes on the alien planet could have been much better but once again were above average even through they felt rushed - like they were running out of time.

As others have pointed out this picture is pretty sexist. But keep in mind the time period this was made. There weren't many female pharmacists, Drs, etc compared to now (pharmacy schools are running now almost 75% female!!). I can overlook this just as I think most people can overall (or whatever you want to call accomodating what's no longer the norm) look past this and enjoy the story.

Off subject a little - why won't Disney release 'Song of the South' - I believe most people would be adults and understand that the movie was made when times were different - sigh!!

And I don't understand why this move has been made fun of but to each his own.

The picture had some improvement (you can sometimes see wires, etc) over my VHS and the sound was acceptable. The DVD arrived quickly in perfect shape. The price was competitive (IF you can even find it anyplace else).

I would rate it thus - 1st half a solid 8 to 8.5 out of 10. The second half a 7.0 to 7.5 making this a very solid 8.0 overall. This movie is NOT a must have (like say 'Forbidden Planet' or 'The Day the Earth Stood Still') but still will be enjoyed by most Sci-Fi fans of the 1950's.",1370390400,,1857,4.316091954022989

212730,4,6300181847,"I recall that as a boy reading comic books I'd see advertisements for Heathkit electronic products that the buyer would have to assemble at home.  E.g., a person could buy a TV set in pieces and enjoy (??) putting it together.  In ""This Island Earth"" we see the results of such endeavors.  If my memory is accurate, a humanoid alien with a large forehead and white hair, named ""Exeter,"" leaves a message that enables a scientist to assemble a communications device called an interociter. I don't know whether this part of the plot was inspired by Heathkit, but the scientist succeeded where I certainly would have failed.  He managed to get the gadget to function.  As a result of this success, the scientist is led to a large home where he meets other scientists who have also been lured there to do scientific work for the aliens, who are from the planet Metaluna.  The scientists, including Russell Johnson from Gilligan's Island and Faith Domergue, are actually being held hostage to do this research because Metaluna and another planet are at war and help from earth is needed.

This is one of the best 1950s sci-fi movies and features excellent special effects for its time.  One of the frustrating characteristic of many 1950s science fiction movies is the absence of convincing visuals.  Without modern computer graphics, many of the movies simply did not deliver.  Yet there were a few, such as this one, Earth vs. The Flying Saucers, and Forbidden Planet that had excellent effects for their time.  For anyone interested in 1950s science fiction, this film is one of the better choices.  So, if you're willing to take a break from assembling the Heathkit, and thereby avoid contact with desperate aliens, you might consider this movie.",1368835200,,1745,4.858108108108108

I wish the movie were longer, particularly the scenes on 'Metaluna' when the story reaches its totally engaging spike of entertainment that is followed by the cresendo of events on the space ship.

Plus, theres nothing worse than a sci-fi movie with obvious scientific errors (which more or less defeats the purpose of a film overburdened with a ton of pseudoscience).  Thank goodness the Professor from Gilligans Island showed up to lend some credibility to this terrifying tale of kidnapping and world domination!  I can see why this was one of the films mocked by Mystery Science Theater.  The plot begs to be mocked.  A noted scientist, Dr. Cal (Rex Reason) receives an unsolicited doodad from goodness knows where and with the help of his unable assistant, promptly breaks the darn thing.  Another truckload of freebies later and they build themselves an interocitor (basically an upside down triangle TV set from the planet Metaloony).  They converse with a guy sporting a bad perm and a very very big forehead.  He destroys their new gadget after inviting Dr. Cal to a secret get together.  Who, in their right mind, would attend such a meeting.....never mind getting into an unmanned plane bound for parts unknown!?!  Worse, it takes this idiot doctor half the movie to realize he shouldnt put his trust into guys with BIG foreheads, bad hair, and plastic hats!  Things most people would realize the minute they construct a thingamabob out of parts they don't recognize, that produces a GIANT screen, which allows a guy with a BIG forehead to spy on them in the discomfort of their own lab.  I wouldnt put Dr. Cal in charge of my laundry never mind giving him a lab.  As for the Metaloonies, wouldnt it have proved a better plan to take over the Earth while they were already here working to that end, rather than wait until their planet is destroyed by an obvious superior race of Zagonians?  Just saying.

Make no mistake; I absolutely love love love this old movie because its so serious and intense.  AND!  It stars a monster with an even BIGGER head than those who created it!  Thats ingenuity.",1361145600,5,2024,4.767241379310345

Upon release, this Science Fiction classic stunned audiences with its incredible array of special effects presented in eye-popping Technicolor, but behind the visual appeal lies a thought-provoking storyline and an admirable list of characters who bring the film up from the usual 1950's fare. The alien struggle in THIS ISLAND EARTH serves as a microcosm for our own fears of nuclear devastation entering the Cold War. The uranium deposits that the Metalunans have come to Earth to mine would only be used to create weapons of mass destruction against their enemies, but as we come to find, this only leads to the complete annihilation of both races. THIS ISLAND EARTH features a great cast led by Jeff Morrow in the role of Exeter, Faith Domergue as Dr. Ruth Adams, and Rex Reason as Dr. Cal Meachum. It also includes some of the most memorable monsters from the era: The mutant slaves of the Metalunans. Certainly a must-see for all Science Fiction fans.

Rarely does a film become an entirely new experience when released on Blu-ray as this has. This clarity has one draw back; the star field actually begins to look a bit silly in comparison to the art used in THE CONQUEST OF SPACE or FORBIDDEN PLANET. But this is a small complaint indeed when you see what comes after. A beautiful picture, this. There is a moronic suggestion on the net that this is supposed to be 2:1 to 1. Really? It was shot in Superscope? Well,duh, no! It was shot full frame for unconverted theaters and framed for 1:85 for remodeled theaters. As the years progressed, only two (removable) aperture plates would be left in theaters, widescreen or full scope. Douglas Spencer has a role here as he does in THE THING or DAS DING from Art Haus/Kinowelt, which needs to replace the junk from Warners and the better looking junk from Universal in the U.K. Spencer was also in Ray Milland's ALIAS NICK BEAL whose absence from DVD is conclusive proof that most distributors wouldn't know a great film if the cases fell out of the sky on their heads.

212764,4,6300181847,"I'm surprised that some reviewers who say they like 50s sci fi give this low reviews. Sure the science is flawed as some reviewers say, but if you are going to watch and enjoy these movies you need to keep in mind they are science FICTION. Have we seen any insects turn gigantic by nuclear testing? But we love ""Them"". A killer vegetable? But we love ""The Thing From Another World"".

Aliens from a dying world come to Earth to take back a couple of our scientists to try to save their world from an enemy who has managed to turn meteorites into bombs (glad they aren't attacking Earth) and hurl them at the Metalunans. So they could travel all the way to Earth but they need our scientists? Anyway they take 50s required suave male scientist and babe female scientist. Despite the female scientist being one of two in all of Earth that can help them she immediately turns stereotype incapable of doing anything other then admiring our hero, screaming, and falling four times in space of about ten steps while being chased. Just great stuff.

I actually thought some of the effects were pretty good compared to other B movies of this era. I liked the meteorite explosions as they hit Metaluna. Also the taking up of our heroes into the space ship was right out of modern day abduction mythology.

Yes, there is a lot of talking of the faux sci type and not much action. At times the sound effects become too much with their non stop shrill sound. A few dust specks towards the end on my DVD copy. However, what really made this movie is my new favorite line of dialogue ever in a movie. When sci babe asks sci hero how he was feeling while in a tube to compensate for atmosphere change he uttered ""I feel like a new toothbrush"". What the ...?! That is awesome writing. I am going to use it from now on whenever I am asked how I am feeling.

212777,5,6300181847,"By the mid-1950s, space aliens had established a small, covert unit on planet Earth.  Founded in desperation, and perhaps with the bitter taste in loss of pride, its purpose was to enlist the help from beings they considered inferior to themselves.  But they had no choice: their planet was under siege, their defenses failing, and most of their scientists killed: they urgently needed scientists to discover new sources of energy to bolster their defenses.

The small-brained beings, that inhabit Earth, had only recently discovered nuclear energy; their scientist, new and fresh, might just stumble on something that could help the aliens.

The aliens concocted a plan to entice and gather Earth's most brilliant scientists and place them in an idyllic setting with the most up-to-date lab facilities to pool their resources into creating new sources of energy under the guise that their work will be for the benefit of mankind.  Plan A was proceeding smoothly, albeit slowly; to complete the team, they needed just one more scientist: Dr. Meacham . . . .

If you are Cal Meacham you are excited about the unbelievable breakthroughs you are making in transmuting Lead into Uranium!  You think nothing could be more exciting, but then, when you build a wondrous alien machine from parts you ordered from a metallic catalog, you feel that your assistant can carry on without you, while you go and investigate the offer from a man called Exeter . . . .

If you are Exeter you like these humans, but unfortunately the Council has tasked you to perform distasteful things to them.  In defiance, you have not fully complied; impairing their minds will, at best, slow things down ... and time is running out . . . .

The counter-rotating flying saucers, audio effects that sound like they were created with a broken Moog, and dystopian alien civilizations that have fallen from utopia.

212800,2,6300181847,"Let's see -- hole-filled plot, cold war hysteria, wooden actors, and a plot that turns out to be completely pointless. Yeah, I can see why ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" made fun of ""This Island Earth,"" a tedious sci-fi flick that could have cheesy fun, but takes itself so painfully seriously that it just ends up being cheesy.

The rugged yet brilliant Dr. Cal Meacham (Rex Reason... is that his real name?) receives a mysterious machine that he and his disposable assistant manage to assemble -- only to have a big-skulled guy named Exeter (Jeff Morrow) invite him to some sort of... research conference.

Yes, Exeter is clearly an alien, and any moron can clearly see it. So naturally, Cal (supposedly one of the smartest men on the planet) does not.

So he gets on board a special plane sent for him, and whisked away to a secret compound full of scientists and large-skulled aliens. Immediately Cal decides to break out of the place (you volunteered to go, idiot) along with his required love interest -- and soon they find themselves whisked onto a flying saucer and headed for the doomed planet Metaluna.

If you can brush off the blatant stupidity of the human characters (EXETER IS AN ALIEN, YOU MORONS!), ""This Island Earth"" starts off decently. You've got aliens with murky motives, a semi-decent 1950s spaceships (oh look, a saucer), and Faith Domergue to scream on cue whenever something vaguely alarming happens. Oh yes, and anti-war preaching.

Then once the spaceship arrives on Metaluna, the plot simply falls apart. It's like they realized that they squandered most of their allotted time on talking and traveling, and now have only a short time to wrap EVERYTHING up.

So we end up with silly-looking ""mutants"" (mutant... whats?) with exposed brains, pyrotechnics, and massive plot holes about the cliche ""we destroyed our world, oh woe."" I mean, if the Metalunans are so smart, why didn't they decide to leave their planet BEFORE it was ten minutes from self-destruction? And by the end of the movie, you'll be left wondering, ""... okay, what was the point of ANYTHING in here? It's so depressing!""

The one saving grace of the story is Morrow, who manages to give a certain amount of dignity to his character... although the guy doesn't seem very upset about the possible extinction of his species, as long as the all-American heroes get to go home. Domergue spends a lot of time screaming (because she's a GURL, y'know), and Reason is just embarrassingly wooden. You might as well have a mannequin with a ""Rugged Hero"" sign around his neck.

""This Island Earth"" is mediocre but vaguely amusing through most of the plot, only to spectacularly implode in the last lap. Jeff Morrow does his best, but tisn't enough.",1281398400,3,2735,4.854077253218884

I have seen this film on TV and always enjoyed it but this DVD makes it look better than ever.  I have to admit they did a great job getting a good print to transfer this film to DVD.  I would suspect this is the original negative and it shows.  The images are clear and with classic Technicolor it look great.  This film will never get a frame by frame restoration so you do see dirt and white specs from time to time but other than that it looks good for a film that is 55 years old.  It would probably cost 1 or 2 hundred thousand to restore it and it would never sell enough copies to get it back.  Its good enough as is.
I do wonder if it was ever shot in wide screen?  There is some argument about this but....

One note to ad, this is a 2006 release which I read is much better than the earlier out of print Image Entertainment release from years before so make sure you get the Universal release.  After all it makes sense since this was a Universal Picture.

8/9/12,  I now have a Sharp 60inch LED and this film looks even better.  Very sharp image most of the time like when you can see individual hairs etc.  I can only imagine what a Blu Ray and restoration would be like.  I also made a discovery while I was playing around with my Panasonic Blu Ray player.  You are able to adjust the aspect ratio.  Switching it to zoom would normally fill the screen but stretch and distort the image but it didnt.  I checked the DVD Beaver review that has the region 2 wide screen version and it is almost the same to that wider screen version.  That is how I will be watching it from now on.  I think that the Universal version has the wide screen image but I am not able to quite get all of it with my zoom feature but its close enough that what is missing does not matter.

Faith Domergue adds the requisite glamour as Dr. Ruth Adams.

The special effects are the main reason why THIS ISLAND EARTH continues to stand up well.  The Metaluna scenes look to be a clever mix of miniatures and matte paintings, and are reminiscent of a 1950s era comic book.  Faith Domergue, a noir leading lady, has the right air to play Adams, and (most importantly) injects some much-needed life into staid Rex Reason.  Jeff Morrow, Lance Fuller and Douglas Spencer co-star as the Metaluna aliens.

Universal made many Sci-Fi classics in the 1950s, but this was bigger budgeted and more thought provoking than most. It was also in color and it's special effects are actually top of the line for the time.

The plot is about how a group of aliens are enlisting the aid of humans(unwillingly) to help save there dying planet which has undergone devastation due to war. The aliens are depicted sympathetically and lead alien, Jeff Morrow in an odd role, is quite good.

Rex Reason and Faith Domergue are the scientists that journey to there planet aboard there spaceship and there likeable enough protagonists. There they encounter one of make up artist Bud Westmore's strangest creations with the ""Metaluna Mutant"", a strange humanoid insect thing with a giant external brain and clipper hands!

While the film wasn't as intellectually compelling as say ""Forbidden Planet'(1954), ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""(1951) or ""The Incredible Shrinking Man""(1957), the film still has enough brains and charm to entertain many years after the fact and still remains an enjoyable Sc-Fi adventure.

That said, This Island Earth was the first color sci-fi film I ever saw on the big screen at the LUXOR theater in the Bronx.  You could feel the emotions of first time viewers emerging from the theater laughing and chattering about how great this movie was.  My memory is that movie posters and lobby cards for This Island Earth looked colorful, exciting and promising of a good time.

When I first watch this film I was not disappointed in the special effects, presentation on the big screen, or anything about it.  It was a night to remember and helped make me an avid sci-fi film fan to this very day. I don't begrudge any reviewers their five star rating for this fun film.",1217376000,3,1094,4.527918781725888

212879,4,6300181847,"One of the most thoughtful and well-written gems of classic 50's sci-fi, THIS ISLAND EARTH has seen its reputation dimmed a little over the years in comparison to some of its cousins, such as WAR OF THE WORLDS, THE THING, or THEM!.  Granted, those are classics in their own right, but so is THIS ISLAND EARTH.  I think the reason this film is often a bit downplayed in modern circles is the slow pace at which everything moves, especially in the opening half-hour when our characters and the unique situation they find themsleves in is being gradually developed.  There is some validity in this, as things do take a while to build up, but the compensation is believable, relatively three-dimensional characters and a fairly tenable rationale for the fantastic plot.  Acting and direction are very good, with excellent performances by Rex Reason, Faith Domerque, and Jeff Morrow.  Reason combines scientific expertise with a degree of sci-fi heroism quite effectively, while Domergue is not only exquisitely beautiful but brainy and brave, as well.  Morrow's character is perhaps the backbone of the story, however, an alien called Exeter who evolves along with the plot.  Special effects are of course not up to our contemporary standards, but after all the movie was made five decades ago.  For their time, the FX were cutting edge, and even today they are still good enough to entertain.  No, there is no bargain-basement CGI, but isn't that sometimes a good thing?  THIS ISLAND EARTH deserves its generally accepted classic status, pacing and all.  It is a very literate and surprisingly cerebral little mastperpiece of sci-fi history, one which modern fans would do well to take the time to enjoy.",1212796800,3,1701,4.99645390070922

Although This Island Earth lacks the poignant message of films like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" it still manages to convey humanity in a hopeful light in the face of challenge. Most of the alien hierarchy look like Bill Murray with obscenely large foreheads. There are comical errors when the film cuts from grand eloquent sets, to stock footage of a car crash. This film synergistic compiles all the esoteric components of 50's sci-fi. It has amazing effects for the time, a plausible, but familiar, plot which is complimented by the cast. It has amazingly surreal monsters that are greeted by a woman's scream and lamenting alien would be conquered.

  2-- The sight and sound of the Saucer Launching up into the sky on it's pulsating green beam behind the exploding manor on the hill.  Cooooool!
  3-- The Saucer gliding over the blasted Metalunan surface and then descending down into the crater to the underground city while the spooky theremin score marched over goosebumps.

  The rest of the movie is standard 50's monster pulp. Entertaining, but not overwhelming. At the same time, this movie defines for me the essence of the scary yet irresistable allure of what we used to call ""Outer Space"".

Are copies lost? It would certainly look far better if presented in its original theatrical presentation.

But nevertheless, this Full-Frame (1.33:1 TV Screen Format) presentation is still worthy to be bought.

One should never compare a '50s Sci-Fi movie, with later produced ones.

We tend to forget that in the '50s, the Sci-Fi genre was still snobbed by major studios. This is also why Masters like George Pal, Rod Serling and later on, also Gene Roddenberry, took it upon themselves to launch this genre with such marvelous products like ""War of the Worlds"" (still the best version ever filmed), ""The Twilight Zone - TV Series"" (still the best and most intelligent series ever produced), and ""Star Trek"" (the best Sci-Fi saga and cult series ever conceived for television).

Without these ""grand-daddies"" of the genre we wouldn't have had ""Star Wars"", ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""V -Visitors"", ""Dune"", ""Babylon 5"", and even ""Alien"".

They all started it. So, please, take it with some salt, and do not laugh just in order to laugh. Think when you watch them, how many sacrifices went into producing them and what efforts were made to bring them to the screen in the first place.

Always remember, without them, you wouldn't even have something to laugh at, because you wouldn't even be able to watch ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or ""E.T.""...

Just think about it. We have a lot to be grateful about.
They all took us to other worlds and told us some amazing stories.
A nice trade-in to modern fairy-tales, but at times, also the base on which to tell prophetic and yes, even controversial stories (see ""Solaris"" and many others).

I, on my part, love these movies, cheesy as they may be, they all took a lot of work to be made, and I honor this work and this creativity, that seem to be lost in these times of highly advanced technology.

If they don't come through as they should, it is due to the times we are living in, filled with jaded people, spoiled by all the visual improvements, which in reality all stem from these very first ""baby steps"", which enabled it at all to develop into what it is nowadays.

  It's interesting, almost delirious and hilarious, to see Robin Williams, in what must be his earliest role, as eXeter, predating the other alien he was predestined to play, Mork from Ork in Mork and Minda.

  Ahh, human!

  Don't think it's him? Nanu Nanu? Think it's really Jeff ToMorrow? Shazbut look again. And again and again. You'll soon see.

  You can even uncannily tell by his calm, gentle, lyrical voice! But those eyes, with even more of that quality, with even more of that quality than RW himself, see it's him, IT IS HIM!

  I can hardly see Jeff in there at all. Only Robbie the Alien. Robbin the Williams.

  And if anyone thinks he was too young then: How do you think he's the funniest guy on the planet (just as Exeter's the most serious guy off the planet)?

  Because he IS an alien. He is not just a comic genius but a cosmic genius.

  Can anyone truly say he was not 4 years old? That in his youth at least, earthtime meant little and that he grew up quicker?

  I need not point to the parallel providence, that The Professor from Gilligan's Island plays one of the scientists, learning in this film the great, almost fantastic, knowledge needed for his later, perhaps stranger, journey to the incredible Gilligan's island, from which none of the suvivors returned.

  I believe this movie truly is the magic of filmaking, and has a subtext, or supertext, if you will, my friends, far beyond the normal, with a scope far, far beyond the 2 1/2 years in the making.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  Rex Reason, with a name as fantastic as the movie's title, shoulda been the guy with a high forehead - in real life.

  With a voice as deep as space, he's infinitely the right guy for this job.

  In the end, Exeter, as his name suggests, in deed prophesies, does... well I won't give it away. Poor inhuman. Think, if he was called Cliffhead and he jumped to his death into the sea he would be even truer to his name.

  He and his kind ain't the only ones with a convoluted brain case in this film (talk about: is that a huge bulge in my head or am I just glad to see you, earthman?) Besides the plot, the mutANT - as Exciter convulantantly, and excitedly, calls him - which, also true to its name, is a giant insect - is the biggest off-ender.

However, once you get over the plot, this movie is very entertaining given the neat special effects of the 50's, the interocitor (sp?) powered by a thyratron, the transport aircraft etc ..,  This fits right in there with the origional war of the worlds and is from the era when they made fun, non explicit movies for the whole family",1160006400,7,638,4.521739130434782
213112,3,6300181847,"Let's start with the most important stuff here if you've seen this classic 50's film. How does it look, sound and are there any worthwhile extras? The colors look quite nice in this print. The Image disc appeared a bit blurry at times with colors bleeding. That doesn't occur here. ""This Island Earth"" was shot using the Technicolor three strip process (except for the visual effects).  The film was shot in full screen but presented in widescreen. That will bug you if you have a widescreen monitor but probably won't if you have a standard TV. Three and a half stars for the visual presentation because it isn't presented in its original widescreen presentation.

The sound extremely good even if it is presented in mono (I suspect if it was exhibited in stereo that the original tracks are long gone). Universal could have gone to a little extra expense and created a artifical stereo track. Four stars for the audio even though it's missing the original stereo soundtrack.

We get only the original theatrical trailer which is disappointing considering the detail that Paramount went to in upgrading their terrific ""War of the Worlds"" disc and Warner is doing with ""Forbidden Planet"". Surely Universal could done what Paramount did with their commentary track which featured two of the surviving cast members on one track and director Joe Dante along with film historian Bob Burns? No stars for extras.

Someone commented on the ""factual errors"" on the naming of the cat. I personally felt that the line about the cat's name ""Neutron because he's so positive"" was meant with a touch of irony a pretty foreign concept in American science fiction much less American film in the 50's. There is humor lurking beneath the surface of the film.

While this isn't perfect (and could use an upgrade to a ""Special Edition"" like ""War of the Worlds"") the film looks and sounds good. It's a pity that Universal didn't put more work into the film for its fans.",1158105600,14,1950,4.808955223880597

213114,4,6300181847,"Here's an interesting bit of trivia (okay, maybe not so much interesting, but worth noting, at least)...seems the film This Island Earth (1955) was one of the first major science fiction features filmed in Technicolor, a process that actually had been around, in various states, since the early twentieth century.  Directed by Joseph M. Newman (The Gunfight at Dodge City, Tarzan, the Ape Man), the film stars Rex Reason (The Creature Walks Among Us), Faith Domergue (It Came from Beneath the Sea, Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet), and Jeff Morrow (Kronos, The Giant Claw).  Also appearing is Lance Fuller (The She-Creature), Robert Nichols (Giant), and Russell Johnson (Attack of the Crab Monsters), probably best known as `The Professor', from the mid 1960s series ""Gilligan's Island"".

As the film begins we meet a scientist named Dr. Cal Meacham (Reason), preparing to leave Washington D.C. after attending a conference on atomic energy.  Anyway, Cal borrows a jet to fly home (must be nice), and upon arriving, his plane conks out due to some showboating (nice play, Shakespeare), but Cal is saved as a mysterious force takes control and lands the vehicle safely, much to the amazement of Cal and his dopey assistant named Joe (Nichols), who I think is supposed to provide a comedic element for the film, failing miserably I might add.  But wait, there's more...shortly after Cal's return he receives a catalog featuring advanced electronic components related to assembling something called an `interocitor', which turns out of be a fancy, schmancy triangular television with some pretty amazing and far out capabilities (actually, it looks a bit like the drive-thru order box at a fast food restaurant, but that's neither here nor there).  Once constructed, Cal receives a message from a melon headed, white haired nerdlinger type named Mr. Exeter (Morrow), who invites Cal to join a mysterious brain trust whose purpose appears to be development of new forms of atomic energy.  His curiosity piqued, Cal hops a plane (one which he isn't piloting, thankfully), and ends up in a remote location somewhere in Georgia where he hooks up with Exeter (apparently he's dropped the `Mr' routine), Dr. Ruth Adams (Domergue), another scientist named Steve Carlson (Johnson), among others...eventually Cal learns Exeter is not of this Earth (well duh) and his motives for assembling Team Brainiac not as altruistic as originally stated, which leads to Cal and Ruth trying to escape, only to get beamed aboard Exeter's spacecraft (commence the probings), complete with swishy doors, and transported to Exeter's home planet called Metaluna (once you reach Neptune, hang a right and go about three billion miles, look for the Stuckeys and you're there).  As far as what happens next you'll just have to watch the film, but I will share this, there's aliens, an honest to goodness flying saucer, ookie mutants with huge brains and oversized claws with a penchant for pinching, killer remote-controlled meteors, some dude named The Monitor (sound ominous, doesn't it?), matte paintings of fantastic alien landscapes, and so on...

I really liked this film a lot...sure, the acting leaves something to be desired (Rex Reason probably could have been replaced with a tree and few would have noticed), but there appeared to be a real sense of ambition towards the presentation of the material.  The main strength of this film is the special effects, which, in my opinion, come off pretty well.  Certainly compared to today's standards they'll seem hokey, but I'm betting when the film was originally released audiences were amazed and I'll doubt few left the theater feeling like they didn't get their money's worth.  The bits I thought really odd were how some of these so called scientists, at least the ones who didn't have their minds `toyed' with, at the Georgia facility seemed so slow on the uptake with regards to figuring out their host was an alien (I would have thought the ginormous cranium a dead giveaway).  And then once they did figure it out, no one seemed that surprised or shocked.  Honestly, had it been me being abducted and taken a bazillion miles into outer space, ending up on some alien planet I would have been seriously freaking out, but neither Cal nor Ruth really seemed all that upset.  Perhaps scientists are made of sturdier stuff than us non-brainy types, of which I consider myself one.  As far as the characters there was some promising development early on, but it eventually faded as those introduced fell into homogenous roles (Reason the rugged, masculine hero type, Domergue the attractive screaming mimi in peril, etc.).  Morrow's character of Exeter did seem to have the most potential, in terms of his altering certain plans based on his developing an understanding of humans after spending time with them, but this sort of petered out a bit, taking a backseat to the visual aspects present in the film, which is a fairly common pitfall in the genre, especially in today's films, in terms of flashy effects superseding the more substantial elements of the story.  All in all you can certainly find plenty of fault with this feature, but I'd suggest viewing the film with a slightly less critical eye, as not to miss all the fun.

The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), does look really good, despite areas that exhibit some minor signs of age (there weren't any frames missing, but there was some specking here and there).  As far as the Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio, I thought it came through very well and had no complaints.  There's not much in the way of extras except for an original theatrical trailer and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.  I was a little surprised at the lack of an audio commentary, especially since I've always considered this staple film in the classic science fiction genre, maybe not to the extent of those like The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), The Thing from Another World (1951), or Forbidden Planet (1956), but one still worthy of attention.

Incidentally, This Island Earth was given the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment, as it was the flick featured when the show made the leap to the big screen back in 1996.",1156723200,84,6216,5.000968992248062
213115,2,6300181847,"I just finished watching this new to DVD release of This Island Earth.
Technically Universal did a pretty good job of cleaning up this print. Though the usual streaks and specks are in evidence to show its' age(someone please rush a copy of the Criterion Collections' ""The Blob"" over to Universal asap....they could certainly use lessons on how to properly clean and distribute their property)the film throughout is quite clear and nice to view.
For this I would give it a three and a half to four star rating.
However everything goes downhill from here.
Two and a half years in the making? If they'd have taken five years I'd hate to think of what they would have come up with.
This 50s Sci Fi film,in my humble oppinion,is NOT a classic of its' era despite what others and Universals' hype machine would want you to believe. The plot certainly had potential. An extraterrestrial race comes to Earth to enlist the help of some of its' most brilliant minds to help its' dying world. But in execution,style and regrettably its' stiff acting this film falls flat on its' face in the first few minutes. It's a movie that tries so hard to be better than its' collective parts but only fails in the end. And the plot has more holes in it than a piece of swiss cheese after someone took a shotgun to it!
I must admit that the movie does have its' neat little imaginative touches like the Enterocitor and a bug eyed ""Mew-Tant""(that by the way is only on screen a little over two minutes in total!).But the special effects which always seem to be touted as one of this movies highlights go from good to bad and back again throughout this uneven juggernaut.
By the time we get to the dying world of Metaluna and are on our way back and find our pal Exeter, the white haired and wonderfully tanned abductor of our Rex Reason(trying his damndest to keep his jaw tight)and Faith Domergue(who should have been carrying a full length mirror for Rex to look into),is really a nice guy after all after delivering a boffo ""ain't-I-one-heck-of-an-altruistic-son-of-a-gun"" speech..(whew!).....you simply don't give a rats patoot.
In conclusion unless you are a 50s Sci Fi compleatist I would respectfully suggest you stay away from this movie. It's a bare bones release with not a single shred of extras. A classic?....please!!",1156377600,2,2308,4.715346534653466

213159,5,6300181847,"Save your sci-fi DVD sheckles for the August 22nd, 2006 re-mastered, re-release of one of the finest,'funnest' outer space adventures ever made--""This Island Earth"" (""TIE""). You wouldn't try to judge spectacles like Spielberg's phenomenon of ""Jaws"" up against 2006 CGI-effects standards, nor should you attempt to compare the movie-making standards of 1956 to today's filmaking of sci-fi spectacles. Just trust that ""TIE"" was the premier effort (along with Forbidden Planet) made by a Hollywood studio at making a state-of-the-art outer space movie in the mid 1950's. ""TIE"" and ""Forbidden Planet""(new DVD Special editions coming on Nov. 14th) stood out as the very best films of their small outer space genre, at least until ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" in 1969 anyway.

""TIE"" actually did spend nearly two and one-half years in production(as trumpeted on its outstanding one-sheet poster) and it shows! Phenomenal, never-since-surpasssed matte work on and around the distant planet Metaluna still thrills today. The sense of wonder overall approaches that of ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" as you are whoooshed off into a mysterious journey from dull 'ol earth to help save a dying civilization. Sure the 'science' from those far-off movie-making days doesn't hold up. But there was a majesty (and a sadness) to the performance of Jeff Morrow as Exeter that sure does. Let's also point out the fine performace and incredible beauty of the late Faith Domergue as the lady nuclear scientist. Another actor unjustly never given her due.

The biggest joke of Mystery Science Theater's series was when they chose the classic ""TIE"" as a film to parody. The joke was on those fools because this film delivers thrills and imagination that have seldom been equaled by other outer space films during any decade. In fact, just why isn't it possible for Hollywood to find still another great story set in outer space to get us all in our movie theater seats once more? A properly budgeted and promoted ""Serenity"" sequel anyone? A film version of Arthur C.Clarke's ""Against The Fall Of Night""?

If you haven't seen this film, then you should be in for a jaw-dropping treat as, along with all of the film's many fans, we can only hope that Universal will finally be releasing a pristine transfer of this classic.

Once more though, the ""U studio"" totally misses the boat by not providing a smidgeon of bonus features for one of their most requested titles. What, you Universal shmucks couldn't get a commentary from the sorely underrated Rex Reason? He gave a fine performance of a heroic, thinking person's scientist; one for the ages! Once more--shame on you Universal!

Why don't everyone do that on all their DVDS now that I think about it?",1152144000,9,344,4.014705882352941
213161,5,6300181847,"Having both film production and exhibition experience, and knowing something about aspect ratios, I can clear this up easily. After Cinemascope came along, the studios wanted to in effect ""widen"" the standard aspect ratio without the need of special optics. This was done by simply cropping the top and bottom of the standard 4:3 aspect frame. The cropped (or ""matted"") aspect ratio varied from 1.66:1 to 2:1 until they arrived at a standard (in the US anyway) of 1.85:1 - which is what it is at present. When the films were shot, they allowed extra head and foot room to accomodate cropping. Theatres had the option to project cropped or full frame. Television of course always ran these films full frame.

""This Island Earth"" is one of my favorite sci-fi films and I know for a fact that it was shot in this manner. I recently saw it in a theatre in ""cropped"" 35mm widescreen. If you have the previous DVD or any other video release of ""This Island Earth"", look at the opening credits and notice how much space there is above and below the text. Also notice the amount of headroom throughout the film.

A number of mid-to-late 50's non-scope sci-fi films have been released on DVD in 16:9 (1.78:1 in film terms) by cropping. But that is actually the way the films were expected to be shown in theatres. If it is an anamorphic DVD and you have a widescreen TV, you are getting a somewhat higher resolution than you would if it were ""letterboxed"". So this is by no means a ""hatchet job"" as I have seen it referred to. It is how it was meant to be presented in theatres that were configured for widescreen. But yes, any films made before the mid-fifties that were reconfigured for widescreen, such as the 70mm ""Gone With the Wind"", truly were butchery.

Go to the Widescreen Museum website (for some reason Amazon won't allow the weblink of this informational website to be posted) for a full explanantion of the zillions of widescreen processes out there.

Where this ""ultra-wide"" scope notion for ""This Island Earth"" came from is beyond me. But a 16:9 anamorphic DVD would be perfectly appropriate.",1151020800,24,2099,4.664864864864865
213162,5,6300181847,"Whether or not THIS ISLAND EARTH was originally released in the ""widescreen"" or ""square"" ratio of most analog tv's is predicated on more than an ""either or"" dictum. While it's true THE ROBE was the first true Cinemascope feature (1953), the first film released in a wider aspect ratio than those prints commonly shown on TV was IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, which also happened to be in 3-D, though not the first film in that format. Most American films released after IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE (1953) were released in this wider aspect ratio which then became the norm, though it did not require an anamorphic projection and was not as wide as Cinemascope or the many other very wide formats that followed the Cinemascope craze of the 50's.

But most films did follow a more rectangular aspect ratio after IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE. THIS ISLAND EARTH was released in 1955--two years after the wide format began--so it does follow that the film was probably released in some form of rectangular ratio, just not necessarily the widest.

For instance: the first three James Bond films were not shot nor released in a true ""wide-vision"" format. That didn't happen until the fourth Bond outing, THUNDERBALL. These first four Bonds were released to tv and to the video tape market in a ""flat"" or square aspect ratio, as there were no widescreen HD sets available at that time and ""pan and scan"" was the norm. Not until laser disc did UA take advantage of the few more inches at either side of the frame that make those first four films ""widescreen"" but NOT Cinemascope. They do, however, perfectly match the 16X9 ratio of the new HD standard as--again--do most films made after 1953.

In other words: THIS ISLAND EARTH may not be true ""widescreen"" but it might very will fit perfectly into the current 16X9 HD TV screens with little or no cropping, which is reason enough to go to the trouble of making the correct telecine transfer of this film over the old ""flat"" release of a few years back.

I suspect this will be the case of virtually every film released in the upcoming HD DVD's versions of Hollywood films, simply to take further advantage of the HD DVD format. Too bad it (apparently) does not seem to be the case with this latest release of THIS ISLAND EARTH.

Hope this helps clear things up a bit.",1150588800,6,2298,4.60880195599022
213163,3,6300181847,"(NOTE: I wrote this review shortly after receiving the new Universal DVD released on August 22, 2006. Why Amazon has chosen to date my review on the date I ORDERED this new DVD is beyond me. This review refers specifically to the NEW Universal Home Entertainment DVD.)

The good news--a reasonably-priced DVD of ""This Island Earth"" is again available after waiting many years. The not-so-good news--this new DVD doesn't have much going for it except that there is now a trailer included (the only extra) and the print is slightly better than the previously-released Image Entertainment DVD. Why it took Universal this long to give us essentially another vanilla release is anybody's guess. I only wish they had cleaned up the print a little more. If you don't think about the ubiquitous scratches and blips, you probably won't notice them. But if you happen to see them every now and then, you'll find yourself having trouble ignoring the problem. (But what else would you expect from the usually-spotty Universal Home Entertainment.)

With regard to the issue of this film having ever been originally ""widescreen"" or not...here's the scoop once and for all: ""This Island Earth"" was SHOT full-screen (1.33:1) but EXHIBITED in non-scope widescreen (2.00:1). Long story short: in 1954-55, about two dozen Universal theatrical releases were shot in full-screen 3-strip Technicolor BUT 'masked' in-projector for exhibition at 2.00:1 in theatres (until Universal was able to start shooting many of their pictures in the Technirama 'scope' process a year or two later). In 1955, ""This Island Earth"" was absolutely projected in theatres at 2.00:1; since this DVD release is the full-screen un-masked version, in essence you are seeing quite a bit more picture than what audiences originally saw in 1955. On the other hand, it certainly would have been nice if Universal had AT LEAST released a DVD with letterbox on one side and full-screen on the other.

However, if you're hankering for the original theatrical experience, one very unsophisticated suggestion I have is for you is to affix some sort of masking over the top and bottom edges of your television screen to simulate the original aspect ratio. I know this idea sounds a bit cockeyed, but I tried it out last night (August 25th) and I was very pleased with how it turned out--the picture looked GREAT. A little hint: if you go to the scene where Cal first returns to his laboratory, there's a shot where he looks into a device on the wall to watch the commencement of his latest experiment. That shot (Cal's POV) has a rectangular-shaped 'binoculars' appearance; if you conform your homemade masking to begin just above the top edge and just below the bottom edge of that rectangle, I think you'll be very pleased with how the entire movie plays at that aspect ratio. Give it a shot.

And the truth is, the print used on the Image disc really wasn't that great.  Plus the Image DVD had absolutely no extras.  But THIS ISLAND EARTH is discussed in the Universal sci-fi documentary included on IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE.

Now, on to the movie.  I have fond memories of staying up with my older brother and catching this one on ""All Nite Movies.""  This was before DVD or VCR's.  If you wanted to see a classic sci-fi movie, you simply had to STAY AWAKE long enough to watch it.  And this one was worth the wait.  Everything you could hope for in a fifties science fiction film is here: Interplanetary travel, space battles, a mutant creature, scientists in love.  And what is too-often not mentioned when discussing THIS ISLAND EARTH: The story is intelligent and thought-provoking.

You see, aliens from the planet Metaluna are recruiting Earth scientists to help them produce atomic energy to fight off attacks from the another race, the Zaghons.  The Metalunans are an advanced race, but the Zaghon attacks have virtually destroyed their planet.  This is documented in the brief but highly effective tour of the dying world, a masterpiece of art direction and special effects that was surely cutting-edge in 1955.

A capable cast of 50's genre regulars is on hand: Rex Reason, Jeff Morrow, Faith Domergue and Russell Johnson.  But the real stars of THIS ISLAND EARTH are the colorful effects, which (according to publicity materials) were 2 1/2 years in the making!  With the possible exception of FORBIDDEN PLANET, no fifites sci-fi flick delivers ""the goods"" like this one.

Universal has done a fine job of presenting THIS ISLAND EARTH is ""out of this world Technicolor.""  The colorful visit to Metaluna certainly highlights this, but when comparing this disc side-by-side with my Image version, ALL the colors look brighter.  Even Exeter's mansion comes to vivid life, with details that may have been overlooked before now.  It's nice to also have the rarely-seen theatrical trailer (a fact that is mentioned nowhere on the DVD case, by the way).

THIS ISLAND EARTH certainly belongs in any sci-fi fan's collection.  For great memories and grand entertainment, assemble your interocitor and take a trip to Metaluna.

Examine all of the original advertising for the movie and you will not find any evidence of the film being shot in 'Widescreen', 'Cinemascope', 'VistaVision' or any other popular moniker for widescreen shooting of that era.

Also, consult Philip Riley's excellent treatise on 'This Island Earth' (Magicimage Filmbooks, 1990) and you will find no mention among the author's extensive coverage of the film's production that the movie was ever shot in a widescreen format (nor that it was ever even considered as a widescreen production). So, take heart all you SF fans and dvd aficianados and buy your copy of 'This Island Earth' with confidence knowing that you're not getting cheated out of a WS experience - because there was never one in the first place.  Then sit down and enjoy one of the best space adventures of the fifties!

****>IMPORTANT (June 14, 2006 ADDENDUM): One reviewer in this mix keeps insisting that this movie was in widescreen.  IMDb is being trotted out as the authority to turn to.  Well, IMDb IS QUITE SIMPLY, WRONG!! (No surprise here)  'THIS ISLAND EARTH' WAS NOT, IS NOT AND NEVER WILL BE A WIDESCREEN MOVIE (unless it's butchered)!  If there is a copy on vhs in a 'Widescreen', 'Cinemascope', 'VistaVision' or 'Ultrawide Scope' (whatever that may be!) format then it's because the vhs/dvd distributors forced it into a widescreen format by cropping the frames to make it look like a WS version - much like the late 1960's re-release of 'Gone with the Wind' which was cropped at the the top and bottom of the frames, transferred to 70mm film stock and released to the theatres as a 'wider' version (to the horror of GWTW fans) .  And, as all competent film buffs know, 'Gone with the Wind' was also NOT a widescreen movie (mercifully, it's been restored to its Standard Full Frame format for the dvd release).  So, if y'all want Universal to release a 'widescreen' version of 'This Island Earth' they'll have to butcher the film by cropping it to give the illusion that it's a WS feature.  I can't think of a more boneheaded approach to releasing a film on dvd just to appease the misguided, misinformed and perpetually ignorant WS crowd.",1149724800,20,3155,4.830855018587361

Since this second re-release by Universal is been greatly appreciated, it is long overdue and needed. BUT WHY JUST ONCE AGAIN, IN FULL FRAME AS BEFORE, WHEN THIS MOVIE DESERVED A FULL RESTORATION ON IT'S ORIGINAL FORM: ""WIDESCREEN."" A fully restored re-release is needed, but this time on ""Anamorphic Widescreen DVD Format""

""THIS ISLAND EARTH"" Directed by Joseph Newman, Starring: Jeff Morrow, Faith Domerque, Rex Reason have an screenplay by Franklin Coen and Edward G. O'Callaghan. It deals with the saga of a pair of rocket scientist, turned nuclear fission experts, that are taken from earth on a flying saucer by the mysterious allien, Exeter, to his planet ""Metaluna"" in order to help in the defence of their dying homeland, which is been destroyed by the nefarious Zahgons, in an inter-galactic war.""

This film was theatrically released in Cinemascope/Ultrawide-Scope ""Now Know As Widescreen"" in 1955, just three years after the first movie of this type ""The Robe,"" was released in 1952, using this new revolucionary theatrical screen format. So on account of that now, this newer release by Universal would make it ""THE GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY OF THIS FILM OPENING.""

What makes this movie feature so fenomenal are above all ""THE INCREDIBLE SPECIAL EFFECTS CREATED AT THAT TIME IN 1955."" (Featuring the likes of death rays, mutant bugs, and above all the battered but fabulous cities as well as the tattered landscapes of Exeter's dying planet Metaluna. AWESOME SETS TAKE MY WORD.

I have even wondered if George Lucas was not inspired by this sets, created here, to display the ruined remains of Metaluna's urban areas, in order to design on his own merit, the capital city for ""Stars Wars.""

Unfortunately, without a Cinematographic Anamorphic Widescreeen/Ultrawide-Scope Restoration, preserving the original aspect ratio on this film release; all the creative artistic elements of those Fifties Special Effects, would be, but just lost for the Sci-Fi archives of film history.

Just imagine that it took two and half years in the making, to produce all this 'Fabulous Special Effects"" worth, I may said, of a two disk DVD 'Director's Cut,' so we can learn how it was done way back then, in pre-computer graphic's 'Hollywood Land.'

Add to this also, the fact that all those sets, created for this movie, were then filmed in ""Out Of This Word Technicolor.""

Now more than fifty years after it's theatrical debut, ""This Island Earth,"" is regarded by film critics and collectors as the archetypal Sci-Fi flick of the Fifties, way ahead of Sci-Fi films such as ""War of The Worlds,"" ""When Worlds Collide,"" ""The Day The Earth Stood Still,"" & later on ""Forbbiden Planet.""

Therefore, on account of all the above, we are still very confident that an ""Anamorphic Widescreen/Ultrawide-Scope Release"" this time preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition, is what Universal is giving us now. Since it would be well received, awaited by all of us ""Sci-Fi Collectors"" in 2006.

Hopefully, that is precisely what Universal is doing right now, and the news that this ""DVD Release"" is been made once again in ""FULL FRAME"" is but just a ""Press Release Error,"" done by an unfortunate oversight of the publicity department ""HOME VIDEO"" over there.

Since the recent re-made of ""War of The Worlds,"" By Steven Spilberg, released to critical acclaims reviews proves that it is worth the extra milleage and money spend to do it right once and for all. Just look at the financially rewarding returns of his film on DVD.

All this facts are win win guarantees to Universal Pictures, that the money witch the Studio would be spending on a full restoration of ""This Island Earth's on Anamorphic Widescreen/Ultrawide-Scope Format"" can also too, be financially well rewarded and received by the public.

So please! MCA UNIVERSAL HOME VIDEO! Give us an ""SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY 'THIS ISLAND EARTH' WIDESCREEN DVD EDITION NOW.",1149033600,36,4184,5.080174927113703
213202,5,6300181847,"I'm not sure what Russell C. Longmire was referring to in his review of March 16, 2006 (a few messages before this one).  The movie is not based on a Chad Oliver book.  It's based on Raymond F. Jones' book of the same name, which in turn is a compilation of his three magazine short stories that were collectively called ""The Alien Machine"".  Forrest Ackerman reprinted the book a few years ago (by all reviews I've read, the editing is terrible in the reprint).

Anyway, I agree with Russell C. Longmire otherwise- it's one of the best SF movies to come out of the 50s. The movie follows the book pretty closely in the first half.

213244,3,6300181847,"Seeing a science fiction film like THIS ISLAND EARTH is like taking a time warp back to the mid 1950s when it was released. I do not refer to the film technology of the day but rather to the encoded culture hardwired into the entire production as a subtext. By 1955, the Second World War had been over for only ten years, and film ticket buying Americans still thought of enemies in terms of storming the beaches at Tarawa and Normandy. A new enemy had appeared and he was the Red Menace.  Sometimes this enemy looked like us and sometimes not.  In THIS ISLAND EARTH, the bad guys were conquerors from Metaluna, who used deceit and trickery to lure nuclear scientists Cal Meachem (Rex Reason) and Ruth (Faith Domergue) to produce nuclear power to save their own planet from yet another warlike race, the Zaygons. The first half of the film is centered on the tight drama of the typical television actioner of the day.  There is surprisingly little action or special effects as directors Joseph Newman and Jack Arnold set up the interaction between Reason, Domergue and Exeter (Jeff Morrow), the Metaluna representative on Earth.  Reason and Domergue are your standard love interest but the Exeter character steals the show with his verbal quips and his evolving character.  He begins as the typical slimy alien weasel whose only purpose is to be the spearhead of the next Red (oops-alien) invasion. As the film progresses, he becomes dramatically rounder, and hence more interesting.  In the second half, directors Newman and Arnold place the film more squarely in the cheesy tradition of the space opera.  There are explosions, bright lights, walking humanoid space bugs, and pyrotechnics that served as the immediate predecessor for FORBIDDEN PLANET that was to come out just one year later.  The climax of the end of Metaluna and the return of the humans to earth even today is remarkably gripping, which proves once again that talent, competent acting, and a stirring sense of wonder and vision can elevate a merely cheesy concept into a movie that is fun to watch.

213246,4,6300181847,"In 1955, Joseph M. Newman directed the film adaptation of the 1952 novel ""This Island Earth"", which was written by sci-fi author Raymond F. Jones (1915-1994).  Raymond F. Jones based the novel upon three short stories that were part of his ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" that he wrote between 1949 and 1950.  The stories were entitled ""The Alien Machine,"" ""The Shroud of Secrecy"" and ""The Greater Conflict"" and centered on the main character of Dr. Cal Meacham, who was played by Rex Reason in the film.  The story begins with an unusual flying incident with Cal as pilot, who then proceeds to his laboratory with his assistant Joe Wilson (Robert Nichols).  After Cal asks Joe to order some new electronic parts, they receive an usual glass bead with two glass leads on either side, as well as a mysterious parts book.  Not sure what the bead is, Cal & Joe start a series of electronic tests on the part to determine what it is.  After destroying the part while testing, Cal is intrigued tells Joe to order more parts.  Shortly thereafter, Cal & Joe receive numerous boxes of strange & bizarre parts with instructions to build a device called an interociter.  Cal's curiosity encourages him to build the machine and upon activation, the interociter puts him in contact with an unusual looking man named Exeter (Jeff Morrow, 1907-1993), who demonstrates the interociter's full destructive power to Cal.  In spite of Joe's misgivings, Cal decides to take up Exeter's invitation to join his team.  Traveling in a windowless airplane, Cal arrives at a mansion where Exeter, several men that look like him, and several scientists that Cal knows are working.  After two of the scientists, Dr. Ruth Adams (Faith Domergue, 1924-1999) & Steve Carlson (Russell Johnson, who is better known as ""The Professor"" on the 1964-1967 TV sitcom ""Gilligan's Island""), explain what they know to Cal, they try to leave, but are intercepted by a large flying saucer.  Cal & Ruth are captured by Exeter, who is the captain of the alien flying saucer, and takes them to his world of Metaluna where even more excitement awaits!

""This Island Earth"" demonstrates that its author was clearly inspired by the then recent events of World War II and growing tensions between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union in the early years of the Cold War.  For a mid-1950's sci-fi film, the special effects are pretty good, and the film is filled with most popular aspects of most sci-fi films of the era: scientists, aliens, mutants and flying saucers.  However, the film does have several obvious flaws (including its very melodramatic acting), which made it the center of parody in the 1996 film ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie"".  In spite of its flaws, ""This Island Earth"" is still quite entertaining on its own.  It's certainly not a great film, but I give it an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars for being a great, bad film, as well as being a cinematic classic.  So sit back, grab a snack, and enjoy the campy entertainment of ""This Island Earth""!",1098576000,8,3021,4.7992277992278
213247,4,6300181847,"I love this movie. Sure, it's dated. But that's what gives it its charm. One should judge this film based on the standards of the time period it was made in. For the 1950s, this was a quality sci-fi film.

Some argue that it's a plot hole that the aliens would come to earth for scientists because their society is more advanced than ours. But that doesn't mean that everyone on their planet is a scientist. It's kind of like how on earth we have people who invent computer technology, we have those who build computers, and we have those who use them. The film makes it clear that there were no scientists left on their planet. Just like how not all humans are scientists, not all aliens are scientists either.

I also don't understand why some are complaining about the DVD quality. Sure, it's kind of grainy, but not really that bad for being an old film. The color was also fine in my opinion. For a version that hasn't been restored, it's in great condition. I do hope that they re-release this in a restored version though, as I would for any old film. And they just need to re-release it anyway since it's out of print and it's a popular old sci-fi film.

A physicist working on new power from uranium and the transmutation of elements to create more uranium, gets involved in a project of a far grander scale.  Replacement parts are ordered for the lab but the parts that arrive seem far superior to anything that should be available.  Then a catalogue of other equipment arrives and soon the lab is set on building a strange device.
The device is a communications console which puts the scientist in contact with a white-haired man seeking out talented scientists to tackle the issue of world-wide peace.  The scientist joins a small think-tank of top researchers who are working on increasing the energy available from nuclear reactions.  But it soon becomes apparent that all is not what it seems.  The head of the project, and his assistant, are actually aliens.  They are hoping that the human scientists can come up with a way to save their home planet.
The story then escalates to include the alien world and their plight at the hands of a second, and vicious, race of aliens.  We learn of motives, deceits, and how far the peaceful will go to save their own home.  Distrust and compassion struggle against one another until the film's conclusion.
This is not a typical B-movie of alien invasion.  Unlike most of that type this film was not a quick project.  Two and a half years were spent in the making so that the film is pretty well consistent within itself.  The pacing of the plot's revelations is well handled and almost resembles a classic tale of A.E. van Vogt.

213270,4,6300181847,"About a year ago when suddenly there were no copies of this available through the retail market, I took notice of the incredibly high asking prices that some individual online sellers wanted. I knew there was no way I would spend big bucks for something that was originally worth a lot less. Then I happened to find a brand new copy of the DVD in a local record store. I bought it cheap, never opened it and sold it on the Internet for a huge profit. I believed a lot of the reviewers on Amazon that the DVD transfer of""This Island Earth"" was nothing to write home about so had no problem with making a little money on it. The problem is, where is a re-release of this film from Universal? What's taking them so long? Are they planning to wait until the film is destroyed? This is an important science fiction classic that needs and deserves to be preserved and presented on DVD. ""This Island Earth"" is arguably the most imaginative science fiction film of the 1950s and it seems Universal is brushing it aside. C'mon, get with the program, Universal. You got this film and a whole bunch more from the fifties like ""Tarantula,"" ""Monster on the Campus,"" and ""The Mole People"" that a lot of fans would like to see offered on DVD. Let's get rolling on this stuff.

Addendum
What is up with the good folks at Universal? This little gem has been making sellers of ""Rare DVDs"" rich over the past three years, yet the clowns in charge of Universal sit back and don't try to cash in on their own product. There's obvious bootlegs floating around, and the Image Entertainment release is selling for big-time bucks.

And it's not just ""This Island Earth"" where Universal, and unfortunately, collectors and fans, are losing out. The studio has an entire plethora of classics sitting in their vaults rotting away. What about ""Tarantula,"" ""Monster on the Campus,"" ""The Deadly Mantis,"" and ""The Monolith Monsters?"" Those titles along with a bunch of others haven't appeared on DVD at all yet. Now, rare video salespeople are peddling VHS copies of ""Tarantula"" for the low, low price of only $30 or more. Soon, they'll be asking for $300 for a VHS copy of ""Tarantula."" Maybe some of these rare video sellers will start offering a package deal that includes a DVD copy of ""This Island Earth,"" boxed together with vhs copies of ""The Mole People,"" ""The Incredible Shrinking Man,"" and ""Monster on the Campus"" for the bargain-basement rate of $7,999. What a steal!!

Addendum #2
The party is finally over for sellers of ""rare"" Image Entertainment copies of the ""This Island Earth"" DVD. I can't wait to see the new bargain basement rates. They won't be able to give those older versions away now. I'm glad I cashed in on mine a long time ago on Ebay.",1079136000,9,2729,4.59958932238193

Even as a kid I thought that the triangle device shooting rays at the escaping jeep was strange because it kept getting new views of the jeep without a camera, hmm, they used a lot more poetic licence back then. I think that no serious sci-fi collection is complete without this movie.
Good special effects movies for that era: War Of The Worlds, This Island Earth, Invaders from Mars (scared the liver out of me), When Worlds Collide (acting surupy), Day The Earth Stood Still (great foreboding music), Forbidden Planet (awesome effects and music way ahead of its time).",1032998400,4,1116,4.52970297029703

213290,4,6300181847,"THIS ISLAND EARTH is a 1950s science-fiction pulp magazine cover brought to life: clunky spacecraft, battling planets, evil aliens, and screaming heroines in distress.  The special effects are 1955 state-of-the-art, and they still hold up very well today, for unlike ultra-realistic computer generated graphics they have a fantasy feel that is very, very entertaining--a sort of ""Wizard of Oz goes sci-fi"" look that is very appealing to the eye.

As already noted, the story concerns several of earth's best minds who are kidnapped by aliens and ordered to create an endless source of energy for a dying planet.  The script is laced with 1950s sexism--one line, for example, is ""Don't tell me that as woman you're not curious?""--but this is actually less offensive than it is rather amusing, in keeping with the magazine cover sensibility that pervades the piece.  The cast plays with great sincerity: Rex Reason is appropriately heroic, Faith Domergue screams the house down, and the aliens all have high foreheads--excepting, of course, that really evil looking one with claws for hands!

Some humorless-type science-fiction fans won't enjoy it, and if you're not the type to get a kick from period visuals you might want to give this one miss.  But for pure 1950s matinee fun, you can't do better than THIS ISLAND EARTH.

213295,2,6300181847,"This Island Earth (1954), directed by Joseph Newman, opens with Dr. Cal Meacham, a handsome, dashing nuclear scientist cum jet pilot, losing control of his jet.  As Meacham prepares to land, his jet turns green, starts to glow, and emits a high-pitched noise, landing on its own with its pilot utterly impotent and unable to control the plane's movement.  Nonplussed, Meacham immediately goes to work in his laboratory and subsequently passes a kind of supercharged IQ test by demonstrating his ability to assemble a high-powered intergalactic receiver/ transmitter.  After demonstrating his scientific acumen and intellectual prowess, Meacham is kidnapped by other (intellectually superior) scientists from the planet Metaluna.  Invaders from another planet have killed off Metaluna's best scientists, and Meacham's scientific expertise is necessary to save the doomed planet of Metaluna.  However, Dr. Meacham soon discovers that Metalunan's ruler have secretly made plans to leave their doomed planet and take over planet Earth. The ruler of Metaluna, a haughty and supercilious despot, is vaguely reminiscent of Adolph Hitler, and his death scene reminds the viewer of the last hours of Hitler's life.  Meacham escapes an exploding Metalunan with his attractive and very sexy fellow scientist (and former lover?), Dr. Ruth Adams, as well as with Exeter, the Metaluna scientist who had originally kidnapped Meacham and Adams and taken them to Georgia (before transporting them to Metaluna).  Metaluna is destroyed and the Doctors make it safely back to Earth, which is saved from Metalunan invasion.  Exeter, mortally wounded, first ensures his earthly friends are safe and then bravely pilots his burning saucer into the sea where it can do no harm. The superior intelligence of the Metaluna scientists is evident in their large foreheads and receding hairlines.  The robotic servants that have been breed to serve as guards and soldiers are even more frightening than the scientists of Metaluna; these characters are reminiscent of the dwarfed, semi-moronic Epsilons in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932).  Despite their subhuman qualities, each Metaluna guard has an extremely large cortex (sans skull), and one seems enthusiastically determined to rape the beautiful Ruth Adams.
Interesting special effects partially compensate for the film's predictable characters, insipid dialogue and turgid plot.  The film reminds the viewer of the limits of science, the dangers of scientific hubris, the need for trust in desperate situations, and the fact that love can overcome adversity.

213313,4,6300181847,"Of all the Sci-Fi landmarks to have come from the 1950's, Joseph Newman's 'This Island Earth' is probably the most original. In terms of plot, this film is more complex than any of its contemporaries and demands more from  its viewers than the stereotypical B-movie of the era. It also utilises  suspense mechanisms at a higher level than its brethren apparent.
  Luckily, every part of the movie's fabric is strong enough to act as a  support beam to hold the immense weight of its storyline. For 1955, the  special effects are state of the art and heavily invested in. These hold up  impeccably today because the team had crafted something miles beyond  sticking sparklers in the tail pipes of die-cast models or messing about  with thirty-nine cent wire devices.
  Makeup is first rate  also, even that of the much-assailed crustaceoid guard. Interestingly (but  hardly surprisingly), Jack Arnold (the Godfather of monster makeup) was the  one who directed the climactic scenes involving this hostile being.  Comprised of the fruits of some very hard work (SFX were two years in the  making), 'This Island Earth' looks almost too good to be true.  Consequently, it shouldn't take much to appreciate that there is no fair  way to make fun of this film or any aspect of its appearance without  seriously scrutinising the work in very fine detail.
PLOT -  Essentially friendly aliens make contact with top notch Earth scientists to  aid in the defence of their home planet Metaluna. However, by the time  Exeter (the alien Earth expedition leader) manages to transport two of  these nuclear boffins back to Metaluna, it's too late: Metaluna is being  destroyed by an enemy civilisation. Exeter and his superiors formulate a  last ditch plan - to colonise Earth and make Mankind docile to their  orders. The two human scientist-prisoners make good their escape from  Exeter's damaged spacecraft on the haphazard journey back from the chaos,  leaving him to smash into the ocean.
  This film has suffered  much battering over the years. Ironically, it's the most thought provoking  of the genre.  The messages in 'This Island Earth' are certainly subtle, so  unlike those to be found in 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' or 'Forbidden  Planet'. It's refreshing to cast an eye back at this release and  acknowledge it for its complexity at a time when wafer thin ideas were  given substance by special effects and quaint models only. Having said  that, there are a few things in here that one can be forgiven for laughing  at. The benevolent aliens with their huge foreheads doubtlessly inspired  Saturday Night Live's hugely popular Coneheads feature sketches. Also, the  actors seem a little leaden at times, surprising given the awkwardness of  their predicament.
  Watching this movie in Twenty Hundred isn't  difficult at all, though. As a matter of fact, it's all too easy to enjoy  it no matter how high or low your expectations run.
