3692694,5,B001M5V330,"I have been suffering with lower back pain for quite a while primarily due to my job. I sit at a desk, hunched over staring close at my computer screen, naturally this has taken a toll on my posture as well.

Someone recommended trying yoga to help alleviate some of these problems. I researched a few of the available titles and stumbled across this DVD.

Like anyone else that has had problems with pain or inflexibility for a while, I was a little skeptical. But I honestly have to say that I do feel better physically which has in turn helped my general mood during the workday. I was told that positive side-effects of yoga are an improved physical and mental state, I would have to agree at this point.

I was pleased that the poses and techniques were geared for people like me who have never tried anything like this ever before. I really liked how this video features a section where each pose they cover is clearly demonstrated step-by-step.

The pose breakdown section in this DVD was extremely helpful because a friend told me her experience with some videos were that they start right out of the gate throwing poses and terms at you ""downward dog, warrior etc, etc"". To someone who has never attempted yoga in their life, this can be a frustrating way to start.

The video had multiple workout lengths that you can choose from depending on how much time you had to devote on any particular day. It also had a nice section showing me techniques I can use while I am in the office.

I am now a believer in the positive effects of yoga. If you are brand new to yoga and looking for a great way to start, I would recommend this DVD.",1231027200,18,1641,4.417218543046357

3692698,4,B001M5V330,"I like the few yoga sessions I have done so far.  It is great for runners who need to do more deep stretching.  I know what some of what the other reviewers are saying about the people doing the yoga in the video, but it makes me feel better when I can do the poses!",1420588800,,266,3.8181818181818183
3692699,4,B001M5V330,"This DVD is exactly what it says it is.  It's for beginners, which is exactly what I was looking for.  It has several routines and a section where you can watch and learn individual poses.  I'm a runner and have always avoided yoga but I know of the benefits so I gave this a shot.  It does a good job of providing good stretches and core strengthening exercises.  It can also be fairly relaxing.  One great thing is that it's not intimidating at all.  The woman that leads the video does a great job of explaining and encouraging.  The background people seem like beginners as well.  One of them is an old guy that makes you think, ""I'm not so bad after all.""  I would give this 5 stars but the production quality is poor and well....there's an old guy instead of some eye candy haha.",1408492800,,785,4.315068493150685
3692700,5,B001M5V330,I am a newcomer to Yoga and loved this video. it is clearly low - tech - ie no background music etc but I actually liked that. and the people looked like normal folk who were trying to learn yoga ...like me!,1403481600,,207,3.9523809523809526
3692701,5,B001M5V330,"I gave this a 5 star rating because there are 8 customized sessions. I have to confess that I had to look past the instructor who does not look like a runner, and try this dvd. So far, I have completed session 3 which is 1 hour. I have an injury and super tight adductors. This session really is fabulous at stretching the adductors and also hamstring. As a runner, I would prefersomething faster but stretching is so important and Marleen will hold the stretches to release the muscles.  I need to go back to session 2 because the parts I did were good for the glutes, another problem area for many runners. I haven't even done the detailed pose breakdowns.

She is an excellent instructor and explains the poses. I am so happy I went back to this dvd and recommend it for people who need to stretch.",1392768000,,801,4.369127516778524
3692702,4,B001M5V330,pretty good/useful.  Helpful if you want to start slow or if you are a beginner into yoga.  I liked it well enough.,1380240000,,115,4.181818181818182
3692703,5,B001M5V330,"We wanted a beginners yoga dvd, and that is what this is.  Each move is explained very well.  Also, alternative positioning is demonstrated so that everyone can do this regardless of ability.",1370476800,,191,4.9375
3692704,4,B001M5V330,"This DVD is great! The instructions are clear, the pace is excellent, and the general tone and vibe is perfect for an introduction to yoga. There is no music or fancy location in which this takes place. If you are going to be doing yoga at home, this gives a very 'at home' feel which is comforting for a beginner. I love Marleen's accent and the way she begins and ends each session. Her words are heartfelt and her meaning is genuine. There are several workouts of varying lengths with the shortest being a selection of poses within the overall collection of poses she covers and the longest length being a session that includes all of the poses. The intermediate length workouts are cut and paste versions and permutations of the overall general footage so that every time you go through a particular sequence, it is the exact same as in prior sessions. I like this because as a beginner, repetition is very helpful. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is the DVD began skipping after gentle use. Perhaps because of the cut and pasting of the same footage into several session contributed to this, I don't know. The DVD ended up functioning better on my computer than on the little DVD player. All in all, I definitely recommend this DVD for a beginning start into yoga. I tried a few DVDs before getting pulled into yoga by Marleen.",1303516800,2,1344,4.534979423868313
3692705,5,B001M5V330,"I bought this based on the reviews below and I have to agree with the others- it's a great, no-frills DVD for people who want the physical benefits of yoga and stretching without all the spiritual stuff. I didn't know how tense my body had become from sitting at a desk over the last 4 years (I'm only 25) but I like that this video is especially geared for people like me. I also like that all of the poses are explained with different variations based on your flexibility. There are also several different sessions you can choose from, which helps when you only have half an hour to work out somedays and over an hour available on other days. I haven't gotten to the part where she demonstrates moves you can do in the office but I love that this DVD offers that option. Overall, I think this is a perfect DVD for beginners of all ages because it allows you to customize your workout depending on your range of flexibility and the amount of time you can spare to work out.",1303084800,,974,4.327868852459017
3692706,5,B001M5V330,"This is probably my favorite yoga DVD.  Marleen is conscientious, incredibly detailed about body mechanics, and kinda wonky, which I really like.

In addition, you get a ton of material on this DVD.  The most valuable part is the lengthy section introducing the poses.  Marleen talks in detail about what the pose is trying to achieve and how your body should be aligned for maximum effectiveness and to avoid injury.  Then her students, representing a range of ages, abilities, and body types, demonstrate each pose, which Marleen modifies for each person.  The viewer can imitate the different approaches and pick the one that best serves his/her ability level.

The DVD also has a bunch (more than 4 and less than 10--I don't remember exactly how many) of different routines, each ranging from around thirty minutes to somewhere around an hour. We've been focusing on the first (shortest) one so far, but I think it's a great feature that the DVD can continue to offer me new material and variety as I improve.

For a variety of poses, specificity of instruction, adaptability to different skill levels, and sheer mass of information, this DVD is a terrific resource.",1279324800,4,1170,4.933673469387755
3692707,5,B001M5V330,"I cannot compare to other yoga videos, but am glad that I bought this one.  I have taken various live classes of yoga over the past 10 years, but this video is MUCH more targeted to me as a runner. As a runner, who sits at a desk a lot at work, I need something to help me work on hip flexibility, and this one has some excellent streches for that.  I like the section on general instructions on stretching and the varied lenghts of different workouts.  Instructions/reminders are reasonably well-done during workouts.  One teeny distraction is that during part of the workout, I can hear a very faint train whistle in the background.  Sort of odd for a professional video.  Also as usual the closer of the ""universe in me saluting the universe in you"" or whatever and that sort of stuff is pretty minimal thankfully from my perspective.",1278806400,2,837,4.546666666666667
3692708,5,B001M5V330,"Being an active, former collegiate athlete, with already one surgery on my shoulder 3 years ago, and countless trips to PT to help treat my hip problems (due to overuse and tight hamstrings) I wanted something different from my usual workouts of lifting, running, kickboxing, and spinning. I am 24 and I have never been so stiff and tight in my muscles in my entire life. I wanted to try yoga and I spent hours searching amazon and reading customer reviews on beginner yoga dvds. I bought one that was wayyy more advanced than I needed, and wanted one that broke down the positions, as well as modifications if you cannot get into some of those crazy positions. I just did this DVD twice, and LOVED it! Yes, it is ""low budget,"" a simple studio with no music, but the people and the instructors are REAL. They are real people with the same physical ailments as the rest of us (tight hamstrings, back problems, lack of flexibility, etc.) and the instructor does not expect you to stretch like a rubberband. She gives you appropriate modifications that are right for you in order to get the proper stretch without taking your spine out of alignment or injuring your muscles. If you want a DVD or need a DVD with an engaging background, this is not the DVD for you. But if you are looking for a true beginner's guide to yoga, this is DEF. for you. My recommendation is to download some of your favorite relaxing songs (classical, yoga, new age, etc.) and burn a CD to play in the background along with her instructions, its very relaxing. The stretches and positions feel incredible and you can feel the release of tension almost immediately. An added bonus is a section for those people who work in an office, hunched over a desk or computer all day. She gives you things to do in your office to take away some of that tension. I definitely recommend this DVD to someone who is new to yoga and isn't ""hip"" to all the yoga jargon and positions (yet). There are no crazy expectations and it is completely individualized to you. Good luck!",1278633600,8,2033,4.5271739130434785
3692709,5,B001M5V330,"While this DVD doesn't offer the perfectly sculpted instructor in a sexy outfit with beautiful assistants performing incredible poses in a stunning setting while soothing music plays in the background it offers a lot to a newcomer to yoga.  It offers a section on breathing, something most ""beginner"" DVD's don't take the time to fully address how to do and the importance of.  It also offers a section on how to appropriately stretch while doing poses in order to avoid injury.  It offers a section where each pose is shown and explained in detail.  Then it offers multiple length workouts with varying degrees of difficulty and intensity.  During the sessions the instructor offers alternatives for individuals with limited strength and flexibility.  While the quality of the DVD may be limited, the content isn't.  I gave it 5 stars for content, not high tech beautiful quality.  It shows real people doing yoga.  For more help in learning how to do different yoga poses there is a very helpful website.  [...]  Many yoga poses are shown in animation giving the opportunity to watch and learn.  A DVD that I recommend after this one when one has learned some terminology and poses is Larry Payne's The Classic Beginner's Program for Men & Women from Samata International.",1269475200,4,1274,4.929577464788732
3692710,1,B001M5V330,"The video is of low production quality. The whole scene is set up in the corner of some random gym room. The photography is poor. There is no background music. The yoga instructor is not in good shape, and her assistants are, to be frank, unpleasant to look at.",1249430400,2,261,4.346938775510204
3692711,4,B001M5V330,"No hype - this DVD is exactly what it says it is. The Essential Guide for those Beginning Yoga. The pose by pose guide is extremely helpful to watch BEFORE beginning a session. The guide breaks down the poses that are the basis for an asana practice. After reviewing the pose by pose guide I was able to follow Marleen's sessions without having to stop the DVD in order to look at what she was doing. All of the sessions incorporate the poses she guides you through, they don't assume you know what utkatasana is.
If you are interested in exploring yoga, but bewildered by all the choices there are, Yoga For Beginners : The Essential Beginner Yoga Guide For Runners, Walkers & Desk Jockeys is a wonderful place to start.",1238630400,6,721,4.511450381679389
3692712,5,B001M5V330,"I'm an avid long distance runner with very tight muscles.  I needed a yoga dvd to encourage me to stretch.  This DVD is unintimidating, easy to follow, and can easily accomodate a 30 min session up to 90 min.  If you are completely new to yoga, the poses are explained first so you are not lost during the class.  I highly recommend this DVD for beginners and athletes wanting to add a little yoga to their routine.",1238457600,11,415,4.35064935064935
3692713,5,B001M5V330,"I have many yoga DVDs and this one is definitely one of my favorites. I have lot of pet peeves when it comes to yoga DVDs:

1) Many DVDs assume you can see the screen when you're in down dog or in a twist and the verbal instructions are so vague you have to come out of the pose to see what we're doing next. This one is extremely clear in its instructions: this pose is next, and this is how we do it, leg goes here arms goes there.

2) Lack of flow in the workout(s). Some DVDs are pose by pose, getting you out of the 'zone' with every pose change (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-For-Inflexible-People/dp/B00006JXWB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga For Inflexible People</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-to-the-Rescue-Feel-Good-from-Head-to-Toe/dp/B000PUB29S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga to the Rescue - Feel Good from Head to Toe</a>&nbsp;come to mind). Some are all over the place with their flows: standing, lying down, back up to standing, etc. This DVD has a great flow no matter what workout you do (it has little transitional snippets if the end of previous module doesn't match the start of the next one, a little odd at first but I quickly got used to them). It goes from standing to kneeling/down dogs/lunges to balancing to seated to lying down, and no funny business.

3) Many famous yoga instructors have no memory of what it is like to be stiff and inflexible. There is no chance on earth you can do the pose like they do it, but they can't conceive of giving you some workable pointers on what you can realistically expect the pose to look or feel like. Sometimes they have some models in the back pretending to be inflexible, but that still doesn't look like anything you and I do. This instructor is not really Gumby herself. I think she started out like most regular people and has won what flexibility she has through hard work. She sure has lots and lots of tips on how to modify your poses. Even better, the two models on the DVD are regular people: they are not young, beautiful or flexible and when I can't do what the instructor does, I can for sure do what the middle aged guy in the back does!

The structure of this DVD:

1) Important information for anyone doing yoga with instructions on how to find your 'edge' to prevent injuries, how to breathe during the workouts, how to stretch efficiently. This is not standard information on most yoga DVDs, but after listening to this I think it should be! This is the stuff that makes a difference. It is a voice over over slo-mo images from the rest of the DVD so you're not just watching a talking head.

2) Pose breakdowns with modifications. Very thorough, very well explained instructions on how to do most of the poses in the flows. Not only about how, but also WHY to do a pose this way. Marleen and the models (4 this time) show the wrong way to do it, the right way to do it and how you can use blankets and pillows, chairs and belts to make the pose more accessible if needed. I also like the frequent pointers on how to do the pose safely when you have back problems (like 80% of us Americans apparently do).

3) The workouts. These consist of about an hour and a half total of different poses, cut to make 8 workouts of different lengths. Each module is shot in a different configuration, (probably to show different angles for certain sets of poses) so it jumps around a bit when going from one module to the next which is a bit strange at first but works for me. They range from about 30 minutes to 90 minutes. I love the workouts. Like I mentioned, the flow is good and allows you to get in the zone so that 50 minutes fly by! As the title implies these workouts are really good for the hips and the legs. The whole lower body feels strong and supple when I'm done. I also really like that there is an actual final relaxation after each workout (many DVDs lack this!). And it even varies in length! After a short workout there is a a few minutes relaxation and it gets progressively longer. The 90 minute one has about 15 minutes of relaxation.

So what are the draw backs?

It isn't actually filmed at the beach, as you might think from looking at the cover. It is obviously a more low budget production than that. So if you mainly want to sit and gaze at  beautiful people doing beautiful things with their beautiful bodies in a beautiful landscape, this DVD isn't for you. If you want to actually do accessible yoga, it is.

The sound quality isn't great. The instructor also has a slight accent, but she has a pleasant voice.

All in all a great DVD that may be a bit hard for beginners at first while they're developing strength and flexibility, but both should develop rapidly if they stick with this.

I'd like to see Marleen Stam-Gibbs do a DVD for the upper body as well.",1237161600,42,4876,4.61662817551963
3692714,5,B001M5V330,"I've had this DVD for a couple of months now. I absolutely LOVE it! It's totally changed my workout routine. Because it has all these different session lengths, I can do yoga just about every day. Somedays I can do the 50 minute session, some days the 60 minute session, this morning only had time for the 38 minute session but what a way to start the day!

The instructor is down to earth and very detailed at explaining what you're supposed to do and what you're not supposed to do, so she's so easy to follow. I've been practicing yoga for about 6 years. She is BY FAR the best instructor I've come across. I'm not into new age or anything too spiritual. I don't like DVD's that try to get you to buy more stuff. She shows you what your body is capable of doing in such a way that you enjoy doing it. She seems like an every day person who has a talent of being on your same level in the way she teaches. Then after your yoga work, her final relaxation brings you to the most stress-free place you can imagine. You will melt in to the floor.

I've purchased 3 additional copies for a couple of friends and my mom. Can't wait for the next series. If you're looking for a great first experience with yoga or just a fresh no nonsense approach, buy this DVD.",1236211200,8,1257,4.190082644628099

8320554,5,B001M5V330,"If you've never done yoga--and even if you have--get this DVD!!! She does an excellent intro with the breakdown of all the poses, along with modifications for those of us who aren't so flexible yet or have back problems (me on both counts!), and showing how some who have done yoga do some of the poses incorrectly and why.  The quality of the DVD is not great, the one I received warbles at the beginning of the intro sections, but there were no issues with the first session that I did today, so hopefully at least all of the sessions are in good working order.  I have tried yoga a little bit in the past, but past videos were discouraging and seemed to only be for people already familiar with yoga and/or very flexible. Due to my back pain and being a desk jockey, I wanted to give it another try.  Naturally this dvd appealed to me, especially with the mini session for the office. It is very simple, no flash, but isn't that what it should be--simple and relaxing? This fits the bill!  She has a very pleasant and relaxing voice, and she is very good at describing everything to where you will find yourself not having to constantly look at the screen to know what's going on--which is amazing when you are trying to hold a pose, lol!  The first session was only 32 minutes, and at the end I felt like ""that's it?!"".  But I already feel the benefits in my lower back! The nagging pain I deal with on a daily basis has already greatly reduced--apparently what I've felt for some time was true, I just really need some good stretching but the stretches we are typically taught for back issues just weren't helping me anymore.  I look forward to doing this daily.  First exercise I've ever done that has made me feel so good, and the time was up before I knew it!  I look forward to doing the longer sessions!
