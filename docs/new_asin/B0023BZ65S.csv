3841757,3,B0023BZ65S,"If you aren't fairly familiar with modern Japanese comedy then you are probably going to miss a lot of what ""Big Man Japan"" has to offer.  For example, ""Downtown"" is not a name that is going to mean much to most Americans, but they are a phenomenal comedy-duo that are incredibly influential and whose style dominates much of modern Japanese comedy. Think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python-s-Flying-Circus/dp/B0009XRZ92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Second-City-Theatre/dp/1566634318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Second City Theatre</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Live/dp/B000JLQPYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Live</a>.

""Big Man Japan"" (Japanese title ""Dai-Nipponjin"" or ""Giant Japanese Person"") is ""Downtown"" member Matsumoto Hitoshi's big screen debut as both a staring actor and a director.  Much of the humor is in his trademark style, and he brought along plenty of famous friends for cameos, although noticeably missing is his ""Downtown"" partner Masatoshi Hamada.

The film is done in a mockumentary-style, following the life of slacker Daisatou Masaru who has inherited his power to grow to an enormous size from his father and his now-senile grandfather, both who previously served as ""Big Man Japan.""  Masaru draws a government salary to protect Japan from the various Godzilla-like monsters that attack from time to time, but his heart isn't really in it.  The public mocks him and complains about the property damage and environmental aspects of his battles.  His manager sells advertising space on his giant body.  Things just aren't going well.

Most of the first part of the film is just following Masaru around, looking in on his daily life, dingy apartment and how he looks after his senile grandfather.  When duty calls, however, he swells up to battle the monster-of-the-week (many of whom are the aforementioned cameos of famous friends), sometimes managing to beat the monster away but sometimes getting it handed to him.  The final sequence goes to even more left-field, as Big Man Japan gets to live his dream by joining the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultraman/dp/B001CHFM62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultraman</a>&nbsp;squad, and all pretense of story goes out the window.

All of the monsters are CGI, and they are intentionally done in a cheesy manner.  Like the bad special effects on shows like ""Saturday Night Live,"" much of the humor comes from how terrible and unrealistic the special effects are, and from seeing famous comedians morphed into giant versions of themselves.  Other than these big flashes, the humor is done in a deadpan-style, and it isn't a fast-paced movie until the final payoff in the end.

I really enjoyed ""Big Man Japan,"" but I think this is because I lived over in Japan for several years and am a huge fan of ""Downtown.""  Like the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Takeshis/dp/B000M4RG06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Takeshis</a>, which also was cameo-ridden,  this just isn't something that was made for the overseas market, and I think if I was seeing it cold then I wouldn't have enjoyed it.  Fans of pure absurdity will probably get a kick out of it, and people who enjoy a good man-in-suit giant monster movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Super-Robot-Red-Baron/dp/B0010T3UO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Super Robot Red Baron</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Monsters-Attack/dp/B00125WAYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Monsters Attack</a>&nbsp;might find something good here too.

As a satire on Kaiju films, this works on some levels, but the heart of the film is some very surrealistic monsters in some not-very-good digital animation. Amazingly, only one building gets busted up--although much is made of public outrage at the collateral damage caused by Big Man and the various Kaiju. However, the last ten minutes of the film are hilarious if you are familiar with Ultraman and other tokusatsu series. The film has other satirical targets, though, which make the film difficult to categorize. Other than the soundtrack being noticeably and annoyingly out of sync, my problem with the film was pacing. Although this is supposed to be a mockumentary, ten minutes could easily have been taken out. Think *Troll Hunter*, a similar film that moves along at a more invigorating pace. If you watch the film, be sure to stay through the credits (think about the ""Chicken Schwarma"" scene at the end of *The Avengers*).",1413158400,,1139,4.841025641025641

3841783,4,B0023BZ65S,"This movie is great, but I must admit it is VERY Japanese... which isn't a bad thing. There are a lot of cameos and Japanese references that I know I missed, but the film really is a work of art. I began watching with somewhat low expectations (watching mostly for a few laughs at Japanese culture) but what I got was no mere cheap-frills comedy.

The story starts off in a interview/mockumentary style, and much of the comedy in the first part of the movie is a little bit hard to catch. The character development seems almost a little dark, and you really feel bad for our main hero, Big Man Japan himself. You learn a lot about why he does what he does, and it's a real play on the human nature of sticking to what we know and fearing change.

It almost seems like a serious movie up until you see the first monster. This is where the movie gets GREAT!

All of the monsters are creative and hilarious. I won't spoil any of them for you, and I recommend you watch the movie without looking up any videos about it beforehand, as seeing the monsters in the context of the movie really adds to the humor of it. Any fans of Godzilla or Japanese media such as myself will know what these monsters are parodying. It's a nice laugh after seeing so many giant monsters being taken so seriously by other Japanese media. The monsters in this movie really make it worth the watch.

Unlike most Japanese monster flicks that I have seen, this movie uses CGI for its monsters. I am not a fan of CGI myself, a reason that I have always admired the modern Godzilla films that use latex and makeup, but this movie I forgive because the monsters are so well done. It doesn't look like a big budget $22 million Michael Bay CGI film (which I still say looks cheap compared to classic effects), but it has its own own charm.

If you find the beginning of the movie boring, don't quit watching until you get to the first monster scene. It is not too long into the movie, and trust me, you should be hooked after that.

A few people have complained about the ending, which again, I will not ruin. All I will say is that it is not expected, and I find it to be one of the greatest endings of a comedy I have ever seen.

CONCLUSION:
This movie is a comedy, but it is not a comedy that takes itself to seriously like most comedies from the US. It is not for everybody (the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.. it's five stars in my book), but anybody who is interested in Japanese media should give it a shot. The monsters in the movie are a real treat, and I found myself excited to see the next one. The story line changes style a few times throughout the movie, but there is humor in each transition. This movie is a really fun watch.",1347926400,6,2714,4.227799227799228

The movie is let down mainly by its pacing which is far too slow and the lead actor. I think in better hands this would have been a hoot. Never been a huge fan of Matsumoto as a comedian in Japan anyway. He's no Tunnels, Tamori or Beat Takeshi. Then again who is?

3841786,3,B0023BZ65S,"Big Man Japan is a mockumentary following the life of a man who grows 20 stories tall to save Japan from giant monster attacks ala Godzilla.

The grand irony of all this, as other reviewers have pointed out, is that while he's called Big Man Japan, he's a very small person.  He lives in poverty, the broadcasts of his fights air at 2am to low ratings, his wife left him and is embarassed to let thier daughter be around him, the people he protects find him more of a bother than a hero, and his agent takes advantage of him.  Its an interesting commentary on how fame doesn't assure a person of glory or riches, as well as an interesting way of showing how people sometimes cling to dying tradtions because they don't know where else to turn to.

The humor in most of this film is found in the awkward and defeating circumstances BMJ is often in.  In this respect it reminded me of the UK version of the Office, its very VERY dry.  The situations were so awkward and depressing that I didn't really laugh out loud all that much, but upon thinking about it later it was funnier in retrospect.  Your experience may vary, but that's about how it was for me with the UK Office too.  Some of it is really funny looking back, but dry enough to be uncomfortable in the moment.

The monster fights, on the other hand, are completely absurd and insane.  They are rendered in (I assume intentionally) cheesey, low budget CGI.  Its used to excellent effect in just smacking you upside the head with their weirdness.  I'd liken them to more of a sketch comedy styled parody of giant monster battles, and it makes for quite a contrast with the extremely dry humor found in the live action sequences.

Some have complained that they didn't get the movie and needed to be more ""in the know"" with what its making fun of.  I disagree.  I don't think a person has to have an intimate knowledge of the giant monster sub-genre of Japanese cinema, they just have to know that it exists; that for a period of time it was trendy to feature movies where men in rubber monster suits fought each other.  Really, if you've seen more than one Godzilla or Gamera movie, or caught a few episodes of Ultra-Man or the Power Rangers as a kid, you'll have all you need to ""get"" what this movie is trying to do.

Overall, I liked the film, but there are two key areas where I thought it could've been better.  First off, the pace.  This movie could've been 20 minutes shorter and not have lost a single joke.  As is, it drags quite a bit.  Overall, the dryness of the humor and the slower pace makes the movie's puchline of an ending hit quite a bit harder, as it is a DRASTIC change in tone (I laughed myself silly the first time I saw it, and you will too, provided you've seen either Ultra-Man or the Power Rangers), but it could have been just as effective had they cut more of the dead space leading up to the good scenes.

Secondly, I thought BMJ himself could've been made a bit more sympathetic of a character.  We feel like his life is sad, but there are a few times where he just flat-out lies to the camera crew or acts a little bit like a jerk to them, and it takes away from his likeability.  Like the pacing issue, a few small edits were all we needed to change this, and he would've been a much more sympathetic character as a result, we would've had a much stronger desire to see him succeed.

THE BOTTOM LINE:  An interesting, if somewhat flawed film.  It was definitely an original concept, and I enjoyed it, even if it was a bit on the slow side.",1314835200,,3531,4.31866464339909
3841787,3,B0023BZ65S,"Strangely paced, unflinchingly crazy and brow-furrowingly confusing, this is a tough movie to get a handle on. It's pseudo-documentary in the same style as Christopher Guest, but with a less obvious comedic timing, more humble, unassuming characters and a hefty injection of pure, unabashed Japanese absurdity. The camera's focal point is Masaru, a soft spoken middle-aged loser with a going-nowhere life and zero self confidence, who nonchalantly moonlights as the fifteen-story tall, nearly naked hero ""Big Japanese Man."" Despite saving the city from a series of rampaging monsters, public interest in his work is waning and he's beginning to find it difficult to make ends meet. Excruciatingly slow at points, it has a few interesting things to say about the longevity of the superheroic profession and the notoriously fickle nature of public favor, but much of that is lost beneath the burden of such a painfully dull lead character. Its dry, bizarre sense of humor hits the mark more often than not, and the CGI fight scenes make for quite the spectacle, but this really didn't need to be half as long as it is. Fans of the eccentricities of Japanese culture will have a ball with it, although they'll have to wade through some arid terrain to get to the good stuff.

And I haven't laughed so hard watching a movie in a long time. This thing is funny, funny, FUNNY.

The slow parts are funny because it is easy to relate to our hero. Like so many of us he just wants to make a living, have a wife and a kid who love him, take care of his elderly parent, and to do his admittedly bizarre (and low paying) job as well as he possibly can.  And like most of us that simple set of goals can seem a thousand miles away.

Think Rodney Dangerfield got no respect? Big Man Japan not only isn't respected - he is hated and taunted by the very folks he protects!

And every time he turns around another obstacle and disappointment awaits in his personal life. Sound familiar. BTW: The actor is EXCELLENT in his portrayal of the disappointments and triumphs of everyday living.

The monster fight scenes are off the charts funny. If Monty Python staged Godzilla battles they might well come out similar to this. Literally I couldn't stop laughing..

However if you're accustomed to more experimental Japanese films then you're probably a little more primed for what to expect. We follow a thirty something solitary guy who lives alone and just happens to defend Japan from an odd assortment of giant monsters. That's probably all I should say, getting too much more into it would be utterly confusing to articulate.

I absolutely love movies like this, mostly because seeing films play it safe gets old fast... having something jump in there and just be totally 100% unique is such a great breath of fresh air. Also, the cool thing is that even though this movie is wacky and off beat it still seems meaningful at times, and underneath all of the goofiness there is still plenty of meaningful symbolism to be found.

3841792,2,B0023BZ65S,"I watched it based on the loopy trailer. As others have stated (even fans of the film), it's a complete bait-and-switch. This is a slapstick CGI comedy about giant monsters the same way ""Run Lola Run"" is a cartoon about a chick running up and down stairs. As for the rest . . well, I'll be kind and call it ""dry."" If you have zero familiarity with Ultraman or Spectreman, just skip to the next film on your list. I was only vaguely aware of the source material, but always regarded its appeal as a mystery I was never going to be motivated to crack. That aspect of Japanese culture might have appealed on a purely superficial level when I was 10 and loved Godzilla movies, but now it seems quaint at best.

The ending of the film is going to seem incomprehensible to anyone without very specific interests in the material it's ribbing, which isn't the case in other much better mockumentaries. Would I find it hysterical if I bothered to dig deeper into old Ultraman? Maybe, but nothing about this tedious exercise inspires me to invest the time required to do so. I can't imagine watching a few hours of oddball Japanese fluff is going to suddenly let me see BMJ as a comedy classic. Life's too short; there are too many other great movies to discover to justify devoting more time to a genre that just doesn't connect with me.

This humor takes aim at very specific targets. The mockumentary portion of the film (80% of its running time, I'll guess) has everything one could want in a comedy . . except actual jokes or wit. If you tend to enjoy wacky Japanese humor, there's a chance you might appreciate it. Heck, I'm glad I saw it if only because it's unlike anything I've ever seen -- and thus gets an extra star. But as a viewing experience or candidate for repeat viewing, I vote ""nay."" I've given Japanese kitsch several chances to grab my attention over the years, and nothing's stuck.

This is a slow paced mockumentary about a Japanese man who is now semi-retired, and is on call to fight monsters for saving Japan.  The film is a satirical take on the many poorly done Godzilla movies.

A film crew follows Big Man Japan who uses electricity to enlarge himself and who is past his prime, sadly out of the loop.  He is certainly not a well loved figure, criticized for ruining the environment and nature.  The superhero trait has been in his family for generations, and he struggles to keep it up.  However, his audience calls him fat and edgy, and says his  performances are pathetic.  Big Man Japan takes public transportation, has an agent who makes more money that he does.  He fights the enemy monsters with advertising on his massive body.

The film is with very subtle humor that is certainly not for everyone.  If you are not into foreign film and not understanding of this mockumentary humor, you may be disappointed.  This is fun, and the spoof on the monster fighting is just that, a wacky spoof.  Although the fight scenes at the end are rather lengthy. The ending is pretty clever, See it twice to catch more that may have passed you the first time. Subtitles are easy to read....Rizzo",1277424000,,1364,4.586776859504132

This eccentric film about a lonely and sad man who lost his family to a special power that turns him into a giant is a fun and enjoyable romp.  It is a documentary style film following the man as he battles with personal failures and attempts to protect Japan from various attacking monster, all the while being unappreciated by his family and the Japanese who he saves on a daily basis.  It is sad at times and funny at times and I think fans of Japanese cinema will enjoy this.  But there is a WTF ending that may leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, but I recommend giving it a try is you like odd, off beat Japanese Comedy.",1272844800,,691,4.134328358208955
3841796,2,B0023BZ65S,"Big Man Japan (Dai-Nipponjin): 4 out of 10: I had such high hopes for this one; really high hopes. I love monster movies and while the idea that a man turns into a giant to protect Tokyo from the various monsters that attack. This idea, which is kind of Jet Jaguar (Godzilla vs. Megalon) crossed with Apache Chief (Super Friends), seems like perfect Anime material.

Big Man Japan is a live action mockumentary however. Yes feel free to groan now. Look I loved this is Spinal Tap as much as the next bloke, but the reason Spinal Tap worked was not because it was a fake documentary but because Stonehenge statue was 6 inches tall and in danger of being crushed by dancing dwarfs.

If you fake a documentary and don't write jokes and funny bits it simply is a boring documentary that isn't true. This whole `the character and situations provide an inside laugh' does not work. You got to write some bloody jokes.

Eighty percent of Big Man Japan consists of our hero [who is a dead wringer for Neil (the hippie) from The Young Ones] sitting. Sometimes he sits and rambles on about how bad his life is and sometimes, as God as my witness, he just sits. In what possible universe is this entertainment?

The monster stuff tries too hard as well. Okay that is not completely accurate, since the city design is so lacking in detail and believability one must assume it looks that fake on purpose. It is the monsters themselves however that seem to strain to get a laugh. (Ooh a giant hairy scrotum with an extended eyeball.) But at least the monster bits were trying to be funny and in their own way were well done, which is more than can be said for the rest of the film.",1270252800,2,1667,4.420195439739413
3841797,4,B0023BZ65S,"As other reviewers here have stated, this is largely a satire on certain genres of Japanese film, and it helps to know those references. But even as one who's seen a pretty small amount of Japanese film (except Kurosawa, a true genius), I still found it slyly funny during the many slow character-driven parts, and incredibly stupidly hilarious during the fight scenes.

Even if you get bored with the satire of the superhero's daily life (it is indeed very dry wit and meant for those with enough intellect to not demand a new fight every two minues), simply fast forward to the half dozen fight scenes, which are among the most insanely goofy visual weirdness I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty. They mock the monster genre while simultaneously glorying in the splendid silliness of the whole concept. Plus, the monsters are some of the weirdest creatures you will ever see. Just looking at them is funny, but watching them fight the bored superhero is a whole new type of laugh.

This comedy turns all sorts of ideas on their heads and exposes the idiocy of not only fanboys and cultists but also the selfishness of modern people, whatever culture they're from.

Highly recommended for those with imagination, and those who can laugh at their own preconceptions.
And remember, even if you get bored, make sure to ff to the fight scenes. They get better and better as they go, and the ending is a cracker.",1265760000,4,1409,4.719512195121951
3841798,1,B0023BZ65S,"As previous reviews have stated, don't go by the American trailer, which makes this look like a fast-moving monster farce for Godzilla fans.  Don't go by Roger Ebert's reverent review, either.  This is not ""This is Spinal Tap"" or anything like that.  It will be off-putting and inaccessible for many people.  The central conceit is excellent: a man who can expand on demand to fight bizarre monsters, yet has trouble in his personal life.  But most of the film is him mumbling on and on about his troubles, and when the monster fights do come, they are over quickly and aren't interestingly staged for the most part.  There are several good laughs, and the monsters are ingenious, but it's not worth putting up with the excruciatingly slow interviews of this loser.  I love dead-pan humor, but this was just dead.  I'm told that if you know about this-or-that genre of Japanese film, you'll get the inside jokes.  Fair enough.  Nobody in the crowd I watched it with, ages 13 - 50, male and female, got it.  And we watch a wide variety of foreign movies, cult hits, and so on.

Then there's that ending.  I'm persuaded by some of the reviews that it's a commentary on the loss of Japanese culture, and on the state of Japan - U.S. relations.  OK, but that commentary had no place in this movie.  The movie didn't earn its sudden turn into supposedly deeper depths.  It was arbitrary.  Some movies, I don't mind not getting the ending or the hidden depths until after thought and discussion.  This one did not build to anything or deserve making its audience work to get it.

So, if you are looking for a movie that is weird for the sake of weirdness, or if you have a deep and subtle understanding of certain Japanese cult movie genres (see other reviews for details), by all means seek this movie out.  Otherwise, even if you pride yourself on the breadth of your tastes and perception, avoid it.",1259366400,2,1896,4.56973293768546
3841799,3,B0023BZ65S,"Daisato is an ordinary guy, divorced and living in squalor in a small house, taking care of his senile grandfather and trying to make ends meet by carrying on the family business.  As it turns out, the family business involves electrocuting themselves until they turn into a gigantic superhero to protect Japan against a whole host of huge marauding monsters.  Once revered as national heroes, the latest generation ""Big Man Japan"" is barely tolerated, and needs to tattoo brand names of sponsors on his body in order to supplement his small government stipend.

Big Man Japan is filmed in the style of a fake documentary, that follows Daisato through his ordinary and utterly mundane daily routine, interviewing friends and acquaintances along the way.  Since he's always ""on call"" we also get to witness the occasional super monster match, in a style that alternates between silly CGI and low budget Power-Rangers type effects.  It's all played for laughs, with a peculiar brand of humor - not jokes, but a kind of deadpan bizarre, and of course the main joke is that even giant superheroes have the kind of small problems that can become huge pains.

3841800,2,B0023BZ65S,"Yes, could have been better with better, faster pacing!
BIG MAN JAPAN is a satire of Japanese monster movies and Superhero shows, and had they gone with a faster pace and more depth in the story, could've been great.
Movie is done in sort of an ""interview"", documentary style, and that wasn't a bad idea, its just that they spend too much time talking and the action is rather limited, and when it does occur, it is rather short in duration.
Story involves the human alter-ego of a giant Sumo-like superhero and his ""adventures"". Seems he is the 6th in line of a group of similar heroes, but he himself is very unpopular and widely disliked because of his clumsiness during his battles with the monsters.
Said""monsters"" are outrageously designed critters that all have human faces except for one with a giant eye. The effects ARE pretty good, and the hero and the monsters really do look as big as they are supposed to be, but the action sequences are not very exciting, nor do they last long.
There are a few genuinely funny moments, but they are few. You must be familiar with Japanese superhero shows like ""Ultraman"" to have any idea what is going on here. Worst of all, the ending!!All I can say is ....WTF!!!! Has nothing to do with the pace of the story and only serves to show this is a parody of ""Ultraman', and not a good one at that!
The basic problem is that the movie is too slow-paced, it it mostly talk with the hero and the off camera interviewer, and when the action occurs it just isn't enough to save the movie from being an utter bore. At least ""Monster x Strikes Back"" has better pacing than this one, and that certainly wasn't a good movie!
So Japanese monster lovers...be warned, this just isn't as good as it sounds or as good as it easily could have been!",1254268800,,1779,4.443425076452599
3841801,3,B0023BZ65S,"And this movie by appear funnier than it really is. Big Man Japan showed a lot of promise. I was hoping that was would be comparable to a film like ""Kung Fu Hustle"" in imagination and hilarity. Maybe I set the standards too high. Big Man Japan tells the harrowing tale of a middle aged loser who, by electrocuting himself via nipple clamps, can transform into a bigger middle aged loser wearing a diaper. As ""Big Man Japan"" he uses his abilities(or lack there of) to defend Japan from an array of ridiculous monsters. For example, one monster is a head with a foot, one monster has rubber band arms. While fighting these monsters he causes massive amounts of property damage and the populous begins to hate and ostracize him. The film is shot like a documentary with a journalist following Big Man( in his common human form) around has he mopes around and attempts to see  daughter and Ex-wife. When the journalist asks him questions Big Man mumbles and answers in two word replies. I think the writer was trying to establish him as the lovable loser type but it didn't take long for me to dislike him as much the Japanese citizens. The longer interview scenes where painful and I found myself waiting for him to fight the next strange creature but even when that happened it was disappointing half of the time. Though some of the fights and creatures where pretty funny, the movie only got a few chuckles from me and my friends. It's one of those movies where the trailer in funnier than the film.",1253145600,,1498,4.548148148148148
3841802,3,B0023BZ65S,"Apparantly, I didn't get Big Man Japan.  It's not a bad movie, it's just rather unclear to me what was trying to be achieved.  Big Man is a quiet, sometimes touching, sometimes ridiculous movie, but it wasn't very funny, nor was it a giant monster movie, which I had expected it to be.
The closest reference I can think of is the movie Kairo / Pulse.  Kairo looks like a horror movie on the outside, but it's more of an existential thing.  It's not horror, unless one finds tedium and lonliness to be horrifying.  Like Big Man, Kairo isn't a bad move, it's just a little too vague.

I especially didn't get the live action end of the movie.  I do get that the movie tries to spoof the old giant monster tv shows like Ultraman or Space Giants.  But I found the live footage jarringly inappropriate after such a thoughtful, introspective journey for the main character.  If the entire movie, or at least the main battle scenes had been done in a similar over-the-top manner, the movie would've been really funny.  On the other hand, if the end of the movie had remained true to itself, it would've made for a truly fascinating work.
As is turned out, Big Man felt not quite right.",1252368000,3,1178,4.437209302325582
3841803,5,B0023BZ65S,"I missed this movie when it played in Atlanta, but was glad to get it on DVD. The comments by several people who have lived in Japan are enlightening, and made the movie even funnier for me. But you don't have to know the inside jokes to enjoy it.

Now the part everyone talks about...the ending. It made the movie have so many more levels of meaning, politically, historically and even as a comment on Kaiju films in general. To some extent it is a parody of a ""coming of age"" film as well, but in a twisted way, because sometimes the things we aspire to look great from the outside, but once you attain them, they seem false and lose their luster.

Therefore, like an exclamation point used on an expletive in writing, it is completely necessary for it to make such a drastic twist at the end to avoid becoming just another japanese giant monster movie. Though it is extremely entertaining, this is film more as an art form than the typical Hollywood big-studio dribble currently spoon fed to audiences. Whether you like it or not, it will probably make you stop and think, ""What the heck was that?"" (""Think"" being the important word in the last sentence.)

BTW, don't buy the idea they ran out of money at the end. Movies usually aren't made in a linear fashion. We just watch them that way.

Ah. I'm probably just reading too much into it. Great movie anyway.",1249603200,2,1363,4.461847389558233

(Magnolia/Magnet Films, 2009)
---------------------------------------
 ** Spoilers below **
---------------------------------------

""Big Man Japan"" (""Dainipponjin"") is a feature-length sci-fi comedy directed by and starring comedian Hitoshi Matsumoto; it is a dry, laconic mockumentary about Japan's last superhero, a depressive, forlorn, middle-aged loser who is paid a small stipend by the Japanese government to keep him on a retainer as the nation's last monster slayer.  The glory days of Godzilla and Rodan are decades past; now the only monsters that show up to menage Tokyo are bizarre, grotesque oddities -- a giant head on a single leg that jumps from building to building, a flatulent flower-pod monster that comes to the city just to hang out and blocks traffic.

The camera crew follows Big Man through his daily routine, peeling back the layers of his sorrow, as we discover how sad his private life has become and how bored he is with his mission.  It's a pretty funny movie, although the humor is very dry and slow-moving.  For the right audience, this is a real gut-buster, although many viewers might find it inaccessible.  Some of the humor revolves around the casting -- many of Matsumoto's creative partners are cast as the monsters -- but the film itself isn't particularly ""Japanese"" in the sense that you don't need to have a specialized knowledge of modern Japanese culture to ""get"" the jokes. Just knowing about the tradition of low-budget monster movies in the 1950s and '60s, as well as superhero kid's shows such as ""Ultraman"" is really all you need. This is a very funny movie, destined to become a cult classic.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film review blog)",1248566400,2,1700,5.134057971014493
3841805,5,B0023BZ65S,"Saw this at Facets in Chicago last night, and it was amazing. It's one of those movies that I want to show to all my friends.

Fair warning, DON'T WATCH THE US TRAILER. They should fire whoever was responsible for that. This is a CGI action movie the same way ""This is Spinal Tap"" is a 90-minute live recorded performance by U2. That is to say, it's not. 90% of Big Man Japan is shot in a documentary style and it has a hilarious ""slow burn"" style of humor that is just not evident from the trailer. If you're expecting slapstick and big monster fights, you'll get some of that but it's not what the movie is all about. It's very Christopher-Guest-ish, so think ""Waiting for Guffman"" or ""Best in Show"" (or again, ""This is Spinal Tap"").

I probably laughed harder at the ending to this movie than I did at anything all year, and I feel sorry for the people who didn't ""get"" it. Do yourselves a favor and watch some old tokusatsu like Ultraman or Spectreman before you see this. That is the genre that this movie is spoofing, so you should at the very least have a LITTLE familiarity with it. Beyond that, you don't need to be a huge Japanophile to love this, as the humor is pretty universal. This movie definitely earned its spot in my top 25 favorite comedies.",1246060800,31,1261,4.361702127659575

The fight scenes are simply over the top and a delight, each one being memorable in their own way, him vs his grandpa is fun for sure, and a flashback sequence to  our hero as a kid and jumper cables on the nipples...Friggin classic.
