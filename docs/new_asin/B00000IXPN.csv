1230128,4,B00000IXPN,Watched this at the theatre long ago with my dad.  Wildly weird movie and makes me think of my dad when I watch it. I liked it you May too.,1509753600,,139,3.6333333333333333
1230129,4,B00000IXPN,"After all these years still entertaining on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Lame by today's technological standards, but good enough to be worth a watch.",1506211200,,146,5.125
1230130,5,B00000IXPN,"good story, mediocre execution. Subject matter is a depraved view into what humanity might become if shed of their morality",1505433600,,123,5.2

1230132,1,B00000IXPN,"After years and years of reading about how every science fiction fan (particularly those devoted to Post-Apocalyptic Sci Fi) needs to watch this film, I gave in and added it to my watchlist. I have slogged my way through some tremendously difficult films in the past, but there was just no finishing this one. Perhaps in its time, a time of accepted sexism when spousal abuse was rarely prosecuted and it was not possible for a man to rape his wife, this film held some appeal. It should not, however, still hold appeal for anyone except for as a cultural landmark to be analyzed academically but in no way enjoyed. It is not that rape and the pursuit of women is not a trope in a wide variety of apocalyptic fiction, but the casual way this film normalizes rape and glorifies the protagonist as he seeks out women to attack and brutalize is appalling. Again, for its time this may not have seemed so horrid, but to currently tout this film as something worth seeing...I just can't fathom it.",1502668800,,992,4.5474860335195535

1230134,1,B00000IXPN,Extremely low budget boring movie. Invest in some excellent Sy-Fi. Everyone has to start somewhere in the motion picture business. Thank goodness Don went on to bigger and better entertainment.,1500163200,,193,5.466666666666667

1230137,1,B00000IXPN,"It normalized rape and cannibalism. It opens with a gang rape and ends with the main character and his dog discussing the flavor of a woman they just ate. The movie presents rape as normal and acceptable behavior, while cannibalism is an amusing twist which apparently redeems a poor movie for many reviewers.",1498348800,,309,4.849056603773585
1230138,3,B00000IXPN,"Roger Ebert called it a weird movie. I see weird is used a few times here. It is weird and at times hard to follow.  The Director's most important job is to tell a story and for the most part he does. It just gets a little cloudy at the end. I think mainly because there is too much weirdness to comprehend. I came away understanding it, but not so confident. A google search confirmed my assumptions about the plot during what I would call the final act. The final scene is obvious enough and somewhat of a twist, but a foreseeable one. It appears that we all wanted some sort of character growth and we really didn't see it. What we see is a bleak dark ending to match a bleak dark world. I can see why it wasn't so popular. However, if you don't require the Hollywood ending and enjoy this type of science fiction, I think you'll find a lot to like here.",1497225600,,857,4.162650602409639

1230141,3,B00000IXPN,I saw this back i the movie drive in . it goes full crazy with the underground city. but it is a long way from the worst movie I have watched and a longer distance from the best,1496448000,,177,3.6842105263157894
1230142,2,B00000IXPN,"This movie is not rooted in any kind of reality. I think it's a goofy R-rated dark comedy, but it isn't quite over-the-top enough to make it obvious what the intention is. The first half feels like a pre-Mad Max apocalyptic film. And the 2nd half feels like some kind of faux-Christian underground reminding me of John Waters Mortville in Desperate Living. The dog and Don Johnson are a good pairing. But beyond that, Johnson's character is pretty gross -- a horny anti-hero who wants to force women to have sex with him. Apparently, there are not many left -- except when you get to the Christian world. Anyway, lots of weird gun battles and weird acting. And a damsel in distress who may or may not have fallen for her would-be rapist Don Johnson. Oh, and a killer robot? Anyway, I lost interest half way through. No comprendo. Part of it was interesting, but the whole thing is unexplainable. If you like weird movies, or like looking at young Don Johnson, then this may be for you.",1496361600,,985,4.53932584269663
1230143,5,B00000IXPN,"Fantastic film set in a post apocalyptic wasteland, but not very dour. In fact, it's pretty much a dark comedy. Decent pacing, fun dialogue, and the inspiration for the Fallout series can be seen. It's not too long of a movie, give it a shot, it is very worth it.",1496361600,,263,4.28
1230144,5,B00000IXPN,"The ultimate male chauvinist movie. Normally I would have given this 4 stars because of the mediocre quality of the transfer...but the ending scene still made it 5 stars. Don Johnson was excellent, Jason Robards was great and Susanne Benton was yummy.  Feminists beware, this is what happens to ill-behaved broads!",1496188800,,314,5.1568627450980395
1230145,1,B00000IXPN,"How does this movie get so many 5 stars???  Let me tell you the whole story in one sentence.  Boy (young man) and his telepathic dog go looking for women to rape during the apocalypse.  Yes, you read that right.  I'm hardly the politically correct type, but the premise of the movie is distasteful and vile.  Here's one of the lines in the first 5 mins of the movie, After finding a woman raped and murdered our main character says, ""Hell, they didn't have to cut her, she was still good for at least 2-3 more times"".  Like I said just vile.  Most of the people giving it 4-5 stars must be prepubescent teenage boys with overactive hormones and rape fantasy on their minds.  Besides the subject matter, the movie was slow with poor costumes, settings, and acting.  The only saving grace is the dog which in many instances was witty and funny.",1496016000,,842,4.450980392156863
1230146,5,B00000IXPN,"The misandry (girl hates boy) themes in this '75 spec fic flic was awesome and spot on.  Harlan Ellison did not, I just read, particularly like the alternate words LQ Jones chose for the ending.  In my opinion though, the film's ending may have told better the subtly of the choice made by Vic (to cook his man-resource-exploiting chic) on behalf of his best friend even at the expense of a girl not worth the effort to feed her.

The sequences from beginning to end required a lot of patience, given their contrast with less creative modern films.  The patience paid off for me.  I truly enjoyed to pace of this movie, it's themes, it's quirks -- all somehow worked together.  The weave connecting each scene (especially the scene when the diggers are digging and Vic and Blood are watching from distance; then Vic closes that distance and connects the scene both there in the moment and tells us all we really need to know about Vic and then even foreshadows the tough decision, and right risky one, at the end.  Well done.

The misandry theme became apparent to me in the lead up to Vic's move to rape Quilla June.  She's warm to it when she shouldn't be; just like a woman does when she's not the prey but the man is.  I didn't mind her absence at all from the last scene.  I didn't mind one single bit.

Great movie from a ballsy writer.",1495929600,,1342,4.4105691056910565

1230148,3,B00000IXPN,"Saw this at a drive-in back in the day, which was the right place for it. For low-budget mid-70s sci-fi it has a nice premise, via the master, Harlan Ellison. The post-apocalyptic wasteland depicted in the first act must have influenced Mad Max and Road Warrior -- it predates Max by 4 or 5 years and the similarities are pretty striking. Things bog down when Vic (played by a young and handsome Don Johnson) reaches Jason Robards' dys/utopian underground city. For all its weirdness, it's a pretty boring place. Then the film recoups itself with a great, wacky, surprise ending. And you gotta like that the cowboy actor L. Q. Jones wrote and directed. Hardly a 5-star classic, but pretty good 70s sci-fi.",1495497600,,705,4.739837398373984
1230149,3,B00000IXPN,"I don't know what to write, this movie was highly weird, but somehow amusing. Some parts were crude and ugly, then the protagonist was able to garner some respect, then it turned completely creepy. But at the end I felt the protagonist matured, he was obviously not quite the ""boy"" he was at the beginning.",1495324800,,306,4.581818181818182
1230150,5,B00000IXPN,Don Johnson has the same mannerisms in his early days as he did in Miami Vice. This movie is somewhat like early Mad Max. It's surreal and dystopic. A bit too deep for many of the lemmings who think Legally Blonde is a highly intellectual movie.,1495238400,,245,4.3478260869565215
1230151,4,B00000IXPN,I liked the movie but I didn't like the voice of the dog. And the dialogue during his time underground was a bit difficult to follow.  I really liked that a pretty face didn't win this time,1495065600,,189,4.108108108108108

1230154,5,B00000IXPN,"OMG! This movie is the best movie ever. Better than John Wick. Keep in mind, though, that it was made back in 1975. Seriously, This movie paints a GRIM look at the apocalyptic future but it is well worth the time.

1230159,2,B00000IXPN,"The whole of the film is like a teenage boys wet dream turned nightmare turned dream again. The main character is certainly a 'boy' character. With no depth, no emotional gravity, no sense of conviction about anythinghowever fitting for youth, provides a character which is wholly 2 dimensional. The look of the film and semi-psychadelic influences amount to nothing more than slightly colorful and incoherent boredom. The film basically culminates into a 1.28 hour joke with a punchline of sorts at the end. The book may be better, I've no idea. So much of the film seemed to have no background or purpose behind its reasons, everything comes across as surface only. I'd heard enough about the film that I thought I was going to catch some kind of cinematic cornerstone. It took me three nights to watch it, hopping for the film to improve or form into anything better than what I was watching. I kept having to take a break from the film because I kept feeling like I was watching one of the worst movies ever made. I think my initial thoughts of as much were right. I wish I could get back the 1.28 hours of my life.",1492560000,,1119,4.544554455445544

If you won't be satisfied with anything less than a high action blockbuster, you probably won't like this, but if your willing to look at whats there and enjoy the PA atmosphere and sets this will entertain you.",1474934400,,415,4.421052631578948
1230178,4,B00000IXPN,"Be aware there are actually two different Blu-ray releases of A Boy and His Dog: the 2-Disc Shout Factory release (that's a Blu-Ray+DVD package with the colorful one-sheet art on the sleeve), and a single-disc release from Inspired Studios (sleeve art is Don Johnson standing in front of a mushroom cloud, similar to the alternate one-sheet art from when the film was released under the title ""Apocalypse 2024"").

These are completely different releases. Shout Factory's release features a new transfer, a commentary track, and probably the most amazing extra--almost an hour conversation with writer Harlan Ellison and director L.Q. Jones.

The single-disc Inspired Films release is an inferior transfer that appears to be standard definition (even though it is pressed to Blu-ray disc) with no extras. Do not be confused by claims that the Inspired Films release is merely a ""single disc"" or ""different sleeve art"" version of the superior Shout Factory set.

A lot of this movie was horrible, e.g., what happens to women during and at the end. But seeing Don Johnson so young was hilarious. Mostly I enjoyed seeing how the Fallout writers adopted elements like the encampments and mattresses lying around and little things like file folders lying on the ground. I tried to draw a connection between the evil rulers in the movie and the Institute in the game. Both created robots in human form to do their bidding. It was very amusing in that regard.

If you haven't seen this film, it is a wickedly twisted take on human nature, with a brilliant satire of the evils of government, the blissful ignorance of the masses, cultural fads, and superficially idyllic middle-class society in the film's second act.

The dog's dialogue is hilarious. And, without spoiling what one could argue is one of the best movie endings ever... suffice it to say that if you have ever been wronged by or otherwise have disdain for the calculating, cunning, selfish, and manipulative seductress, you will find the film's conclusion perversely satisfying to an extreme.

Slow moving in parts of the first half, and has the occasional cringe-worthy content and lines, but the payoff is well worth it if you watch to the very last line. Five stars!",1431907200,,1034,4.897142857142857

The film, if you have not see it, is a classic of 1970's Sci-Fi and even though the effects as a bit low production the story is one of Harlan Ellison's best.
I originally reviewed this after I purchased a DVD that was obviously a bootleg and rated it 1 star. The sound track on that film is out of sync with the picture  and the DVD has no liner notes, the menu no ""Special Features"" and if you return to the menu it start the DVD over.

 What a treat.  Don Johnson is just a kid in this.  It's a fun sci-fi romp, but non-sci-fi folks will enjoy it, too.  Not a big budget, but not necessary to enjoy the ""nightmare"" of being the one of the few males to survive  the bomb--sexually potent.  Someone's imagination went way around the bend in writing this life-after-the-bomb scenario.  The survivalist/realist struggle from xxxxxxx (not to spoil it too much) is second to the wit & humor proposed as ""realism""  in post-apocalyptic life.  The box cover captures that theme, but the life & death post-apocalyptic challenges faced by a boy and his dog takes a different path in this tale.  It's not a blockbuster.  It might be considered a classic.  It's definitely worth watching.  Need a smile?  Get the popcorn, kick back & enjoy.",1393200000,,905,4.711538461538462

Like many, I first saw this in college, about 10 years after it was made (maybe around 1981 is when I saw it).  At the time I remembered most the character Jason Robards plays and the bizarre white face/clown makeup everyone wears in the underground -- now Harlan Ellison explains it!  Many call this an ""underground classic"" (ironically enough), but for any horror/sci fi fan of the 20th century films, I believe this is essential.",1392595200,,604,4.723809523809524

He is kidnapped by conformists who base their community on the Hollywood view of Topeka, Kansas, then escapes and feeds his girlfriend to his dog.

1230359,5,B00000IXPN,"I remember the first time I stumbled across A Boy & His Dog - relaxing in my apartment with my roommates, cycling through the vast amounts of movies on Netflix until we randomly decided to give this a go. I'm fairly certain my roommates thought the movie quite odd, but I was captivated by it. So much so that I ended up watching it again in my room several days later and eventually gave in and purchased the dvd.

A Boy & His Dog could be considered boring to some, laughable to others, and possibly even downright sexist to a good few. There is something unique about this film that seems to capture a great many and turn the rest off completely - I'm not sure exactly what that is.

Simply put, the story revolves around a young man (Vic) and his telepathic dog (Blood) as they scavenge the wasteland post-apocalypse in search of food, women, and more or less, excitement. It is definitely slow moving compared to today's fast paced action-oriented doomsday movies, but I believe that is one of the reasons I enjoyed it as much as I did. It was different than the rest. I didn't feel rushed through the story, but instead felt comfortable with the pace. I found my curiosity peaked every twist and turn in the movie wondering and waiting for what might just happen next in the odd duo's adventure.

I would highly recommend this movie a try if you are a fan of any of the following post-apocalyptic tales: Fallout 3, The Last of Us, I Am Legend, The Postman, The Day of the Triffids, The Book of Eli, and Children of Men.

1230361,5,B00000IXPN,"The speculative portrayal of a post-nuclear-holocaust-earth is chilling in its descent into barbarism.  The portrayal of an isolated community trying to maintain a structured society is even more chilling as it gradually reveals the lengths people will go to and the compromises they will make in human values in order to avoid the disorder elsewhere.  Although based on a great story by the ever-inventive Harlan Ellison, the film still had the potential to be very depressing and unremarkable, but clever direction, sensitive cinematography and a liberal sprinkling of dark humour lift it to its undoubted cult status.  Some fine performances too, which is a blessing in a genre where special effects often become the focus at the expense of the acting.  While engrossed in the unfolding story, it is all to easy to forget that much of the dialogue heard on the soundtrack represents an audible rendition of the telepathic communication between the boy and his dog, which, once appreciated, enhances to one's respect for the acting.

1230394,4,B00000IXPN,"Based on a popular story by reknowned sci-fi writer Harlan Ellison, this film is suitable for those who enjoy sci-fi with weird undertones.  A Boy and His Dog tells the story of a post-apocalyptic world where women are scarce commodities to be hunted.  Don Johnson (young and pre-Miami Vice) plays Vic, a wanderer in the devistated wasteland whose number one priority is indulging his carnal lust in pursuit of the opposite sex.  Vic's sole companion in his travels is a dog who he shares a psychic bond with and whose hunting talents come in handy by catching the scent of nearby females.  Unfortunately the latest gal this twosome encounters has plans for Vic, which will lead him into a strange underground world.

SPOILERS:

Set in a post Apocalpytic world where food and women are scarce, Vic (Don Johnson) his telepathic dog Blood (the voice of the late Tim McIntire who also co-wrote the music score)hunt for both and get more than they bargained for when they meet Quilla June (Susanne Benton). Quilla has escaped from an entire community underground and she lures him back into a trap ready to be sprung by the leader of the town (Jason Robards).

END OF SPOILERS:

The blu-ray transfer of ""A Boy and His Dog"" is the best the film has ever looked on home video. An early DVD release the film receives an improved transfer for its high def debut. The source print could have used some sprucing up but, on the whole,the film looks nice. ""A Boy and His Dog"" will never look as sharp or brilliant as a contemporary film but Shout has done the best with the source as possible.

Unfortunately, only the original mono elements are available for the soundtrack so we don't get a 5.1 lossless presentation. Still, the mono lossless presentation sounds quite nice with dialog to the forefront of the mix.

The special features include a good commentary track with director L.Q. Jones, his director of photography John Arthur Morrill, and Critic Charles Champlin which appeared on the 1999 DVD.

New to this set is a fifty minute conversation between director Jones and author Ellison. It also appears on the DVD. They still disagree about the last line of the film (Ellison still hates it)but they clearly enjoy each other's company. We also get the original theatrical trailer and radio ads for the films.

A well made low budget science fiction film (and one of the few adapted from Ellison's work that manages to be relatively faithful to the source) with a good transfer and some nice extras, ""A Boy and His Dog"" is well worth catching.",1376265600,,2022,4.724431818181818
1230414,5,B00000IXPN,"A Boy, A Dog, A Woman -- and L.Q. Jones and Harlan Ellison: A Writer's Wounds 40 Years Later
I liked Blood.
I liked Blood right up to the end.

I liked Blood until Blood, the telepathic dog, the sardonic sage, laughed callously at the death of a woman, until Blood dismissively made a cruel joke out her and then laughed until fade-out.

Shout! Factory has released the 1975 cult film A Boy and His Dog, on Blu-ray, directed by L. Q. Jones, who also adapted the literate and multi-faceted Harlan Ellison's award winning novella for the screenplay.

This film about a post-apocalyptic Earth, set in the first half of the film in barren desert landscapes, bleached of color, bleached of life, probably set the tone for many later films depicting the aftermath of nuclear war, including the Mad Max films, before Mel Gibson revealed maybe he wasn't just acting nutso crazy mad.

L. Q. Jones is adept at capturing the desert landscapes, and this Blu-ray showcases the natural lighting of the cinematography.

The second half of the film is set within a brightly lit world of artifice, a world of conformity and rigid rules and grotesque cosmetic and fashion trends. L. Q. Jones is less capable of capturing this world, although he neatly handles one of the key sequences underscoring the recurrent theme of sexuality in the film, capturing it and making it clear what is going on in a fashion that certainly wasn't common-place in the mid-'70s in pop culture.

I know. I was there. And believe me, violence was never the problem when writing comics.

Sex was the problem. It was sexuality that would come under attack by those who would determine what you could get to see...and not see. I often suspected that those editorial censors were like ""family value"" politicians. It's okay for them. Not for you.

Shout's Blu-ray of A Boy and His Dog is invaluable to writers (and to those who want the history, the background of what shapes and influences the movie they have known for years).

What I find most interesting and emotionally raw is the 40 minute video interview on the Blu-ray of Harlan Ellison, the creator of the story, of this novella he has loved and had turned into a film, and L. Q. Jones.

I've written much more on this in my Riding Shotgun column up on ComicsBulletin.com, complete with video of Harlan speaking at a convention, and even the trailer.

Hope those of you who are interested in the BluRay have found this of some value.

1230442,4,B00000IXPN,"A Boy and His Dog (L. Q. Jones, 1975)

A Boy and His Dog was--and still is--widely seen as a failed, if valiant, experiment. I'm not entirely sure why; as far as I could tell, there's not a great deal about it that actually fails. Character actor L. Q. Jones, who acted in over one hundred movies during a five-decade (as of now, he seems to have retired; his last job in front of the camera as I write this was in 2006, though he seems to still be alive) career, only stepped behind the camera to direct a feature twice--1964's The Devil's Bedroom and this. Whether the decision not to direct again was his or Hollywood's I do not know. Judging by this film, either way, it was the wrong decision.

Vic (Miami Vice's Don Johnson in an early role) and his dog Blood are inhabitants of a blasted, post-nuclear landscape where food and women are the most sought-after commodities, in that order. Blood, who communicates with Vic telepathically, tells tales of a place Over the Hills, where the land is still arable and existence isn't jst a daily grind. The two of them make a pact to try and get there, just as soon as they can save up enough supplies for the journey. There is also Under--a series of communities that sprung up far beneath the surface after World War IV destroyed it. While they are ruled by zealots (they're a grimly amusing precursor to today's ""gated communities""), life is much easier there. Or is it? Vic meets Quilla (The Last Horror Movie's Susanne Benton), who just may be the woman of his dreams, who's from Under, and after an attack, Vic and Quilla get separated from Blood, and Quilla takes Vic home for some life-saving surgery. At first, the community accepts him with open arms--but the longer he stays, the more he wonders if life under the strictly-regimented gaze of Lou Craddock (Jason Robards) is really better than life on the surface.

Word on the street (at least word on IMDB) has it that Harlan Ellison began the screenplay himself, but it was taken over by Jones and producer Alvy Moore after Ellison suffered a case of writer's block. (I find that excuse somewhat hard to believe given that Ellison is--by far--one of the most prolific American writers of the past century.) This would explain the rather nave, black-and-white worldview the movie presents, which is probably the least Ellisonian thing about it. That said, this being mid-seventies sci-fi, expecting a subtle, shaded moral landscape would be... ridiculous, really. Even the greatest sci-fi films of the seventies were overly-simplistic in terms of their morals (Soylent Green, anyone?). I don't necessarily ding the movie for that any more than I ding it for presenting a world in which women are, for all intents and purposes, currency. It's a horrible idea to contemplate, but given the parameters of the world we are handed, it's also not an implausible one. (Lord knows once we get Under, the boys get their comeuppance with a vengeance.) This, of course, makes for an uncomfortable viewing experience--but then, one assumes, as one assumes in much dystopian science fiction, that's the idea. If you don't find, say, A Clockwork Orange uneasy viewing, that says a great deal more about you than it does about the film, I should think.

A Boy and His Dog has faded unjustly into obscurity over the past four decades. It deserves to be rediscovered and placed on the same short shelf of seventies sci-fi-classics as many of the other films I have mentioned in this review. Both technically and artistically, this is a good, if disturbing, little movie, and it deserves much more attention than it gets. *** ",1367712000,,3619,4.756369426751593
1230443,3,B00000IXPN,"Portions of the movie take place at night or indoors and it's a bit too dark. At times the musical score and the sound effects are perfect and at times they are a major distraction. The script is really brought to life though. It's a very good adaptation of the story. It concerns a boy, Vic, and his intelligent K-9 traveling companion, 'Blood'.  Blood the dog is actually smarter than Vic, and telepathic. The audience can hear what he says/thinks. Similar to Dean Koontz 'The Watchers', he's descended from dogs who have been genetically engineered for war.

Vic used to be in a gang but now he's a solo 'rover'. Vic and Blood, the dog, travel across a post-apocalypse landscape in search of food, sex, and what good times they can find. In the middle of the movie, honest to goodness, there's a scene where it's apparent there's a love triangle between Vic, Blood, and a human female they come across. The girl in question is Quilla June, a young girl from an underground shelter who's been sent above ground to lure one of the young solos underground. Quilla June ends up knocking Vic out but 'accidentally' leaving behind her ID card/gate pass. Vic feels compelled to stalk her, and follow her into the down under, presumably to get back whatever he feels she took from him, or from his well-developed sense of entitlement.

Jokes aside, it's as if the movie makers took care to make this movie PETA approved. It's not so kind to human females. When the movie begins a gang rapes and kills a young woman. When Vic, the protagonist, gets there, kind of like a scavenger, he's only sorry they killed her, ""She could have been used one or two more times"" he laments. It's a wonder there are so many girls around (at least Vic spends a bit of his time trying to find his next lay). From there Vic and Blood attend an old beat up movie theater (which will figure later in the review) and watch old films with the gangs.

In the above ground world girls don't care too much for sex. In the original story Vic remembers raping a girl screaming all the while saying she'd get him. Afterwards he ""tied her up just to be sure"". In the underground world, the girls want sex. There the men are sterile, though presumably still able to do it. One reviewer saying (and I did not notice it myself) this is one of the messages of the movie, repressing men leads to them being sterile.

It's almost like two movies in one. In the second half Vic leaves Blood behind and travels underground to a city critic Roger Ebert called ""a truly horrible place that looks like a cross between a Norman Rockwell small town and a circus sideshow.""

The underground community has loudspeakers constantly blaring out relationship advice and recipe tips to the public. For me it tied the movie together a bit in that it reminded me of the voice over of Blood the dog giving out advice earlier in the movie. I have to admit here, If I were the boss, or owned my own island or something, this is the style of propaganda that would appear in the 'free press'.

It is a scary view of 50's America though run by 3 members of 'the committee' (three committee members who feel no compunction to follow the helpful advice given out by the loudspeaker for sure) backed up by the muscle of a single robot/android enforcer, Michael. After being written up three times for 'transgressions', citizens (whole families) are sent, ""off to the farm"" a euphemism for being killed by the robot. ""Write down they both had heart attacks"" a committee member says after disposing a case.

Vic manages to escape the underground where he's been caught by Michael the robot and forced to be their sperm donor (since they are infertile that's why they are holding him). Quilla June, who has a change of heart, steals Vic's guns back for him helping him escape. After about 30 rounds of ammunition Vic puts their robot out of commission. This is the point in the original story where it becomes obvious it has an agenda. As they make their escape, shooting at the last townsfolk chasing them, Vic says to himself, ""they should have known better than to mess with Jimmy Cagney."" Cagney being the actor who always plays the gangster in the movies he loves to watch. Then of course right after their escape, there's the twist ending.

This is the most conservative work of fiction I've ever read, ever. Perhaps the filmmaker failed to convey this but I think the failure is more on the part of the viewer. Do we have an underlying fear of seeing things in an incorrect way? The original story was written in 1968. Is it difficult for us to empathize with a world view so different from the one we're ordinarily presented with?

Perhaps, though, it's just an ode to freedom, or a dark comedy where everything in existence is evil and self serving.

Or perhaps it's simply a well-needed critique of conservative America.

We're often told about the atrocities of the Nazi's. Or even of the evils of communism (although this isn't taken as seriously, hardly seriously, even when it's documented as in the case of the Khmer Rouge, when millions immigrated to America - oops were exterminated). Let's just hope next time the reader er the ringleaders will be publicly brought to justice. That should delay communism another Century or so.",1365033600,,5275,4.6

S. of A.). As in all of Don Johnson's earliest films (his more frequently buttocks- and bollocks-baring ""The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart"" and ""The Harrad Experiment"", especially), this actor, in appearance and personality, was winsomely, alluringly cute, and enticingly sensuous in bearing. Johnson's occasional nudity, or, more frequently, his near- or partial-nakedness in this film, amply show off such elegantly youthful assets, as then usual in his burgeoning cinematic career. Johnson's spunky manner was delightfully insouciant and irresistably, potently sexy. He really has been the main reason, over the years, for continuing to want to see and to treasure this peculiar movie.

The film gets rather grim at some points, but the surrealism of it all makes the viewer laugh as well as squirm a bit. Don Johnson did not flinch at anything that his scripts might demand at this early stage of his life in film; it helped that one of his assets was being so naturally exhibitionistic and playful by nature, revelling in his own boyish beauty and lithe atheleticism.

As for young Vic's canine companion and tutor, named Blood, whose pet-human, hunting boy, and pupil Vic happens to be, that wily and domineering animal is shaggy and, not surprisingly, his dawggy lips don't move with his dialogue. Not to worry. It's a telephathic kind of thing!

Jason Robards is weird and theatening, just the right guy for one of the villains in the film's post-nuclear underworld.

1230492,4,B00000IXPN,"Since its release in 1975, L.Q. Jones' A Boy and His Dog has become one of the quintessential midnight movies. This faithful adaptation of Harlan Ellison's novel by the same name presents a dark post-apocalyptic world inhabited by barbarians above ground and a Stepford-like totalitarian society below. Our hero Vic (Don Johnson in an early staring role) and his telepathic dog must wind their way through various adventures as they struggle to survive. A Boy and His Dog was an instant cult classic and the direct inspiration for George Miller's Road Warrior series.

This is a unique film that has stood the test of time and achieved the rank of classic. In his commentary track director L.Q Jones says that the movie played continuously for 14 years. I remember seeing it on its second reissue one midnight in 1982. The film is a testament to independant filmaking and distribution.

The disc that I screened presented a letterboxed wide screen presentation with decent picture quality. The Letterboxed transfer of A BOY AND HIS DOG is an absolute necessity for one's enjoyment of this film. Without the Letterboxing, its a complete waste of time. The transfer was supervised by both the film's director L.Q. Jones and cinematographer John Morrill. The colors look very good and the image is nicely detailed. The film element used for the transfer has a number of markings scattered throughout, but none become too bothersome. Digital artifacts were virtually absent from this DVD. The monaural soundtrack is presented in two channel Dolby Digital.  Supplements include an audio commentary with the film's director L.Q. Jones as well as cinematographer John Morrill and film critic Charles Champlin. The commentary gives a great deal of background on the production. Unlike most commentaries, this one doesn't pull any punches and doesn't gloss over the problems with the film.

1230528,4,B00000IXPN,"""A Boy and His Dog"" is one of the strangest science fiction movies to come out of the 1970's. The then-unknown Don Johnson stars as Vic, a survivor of World War Four, who roams the post-apocalyptic wasteland with his best friend, a dog named Blood. Blood is no ordinary dog, though: he is a hyper-intelligent mutation who can telepathically speak to Vic (voiced with sarcastic resignation by Tim McIntire.) The film is based on a novella by Harlan Ellison, and is equal parts commentary on the geopolitics of the cold war (as perceived in the mid 1970's,) and horrific survivalist black comedy (some would argue they were the same thing.)

I found the film entertaining, though sometimes for the wrong reasons. It is effective as a dark comedic piece, though the acting was sometimes a bit stilted even from such greats as Jason Robards (in possibly his creepiest role) and Alvy Moore. The surrealism of the subterranean world that Johnson discovers is both highly amusing and alarming, and features frequently unexpected plot twists. In this regard director L. Q. Jones (Justus McQueen) achieves his goal, and despite the ridiculous talking dog concept central to the movie, the feature works better than I expected. As an aside, the commentary is very illuminating, and covers many directorial and production decisions, including a lengthy discussion of the pros and cons of having Blood's lips move during his dialogue.

I was frankly torn about what rating the film should have: on one hand it is a bit heavy-handed and ponderous, the pacing can lag at times, and some of the performances seem intermittently wooden, but on the other hand the movie is extremely creative, and viscerally captures the attitudes of the era better than many works of historical nonfiction, and certainly better than the vast majority of sci-fi films ever could. I settled on four stars: the film does have flaws, but is still fun to watch. I was especially pleased with the conclusion of the film that involved both supremely sly writing and nuanced acting from Johnson, making it clear that Vic had finally correctly come to terms with the priorities in his life. I recommend ""A Boy and His Dog"" as a bizarre cold war relic and blast from the past version of 1970's dystopian filmmaking.",1303603200,,2272,4.9140625

Of course now that finally a Blu-ray edition has been released, the problem of no anamorphic version has been solved.  The new Blu-ray is quite good.  Yeah!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I purchased the latest A BOY AND HIS DOG from amazon based on the aspect ratio listing as 2.35:1 widescreen - and the following paragraph in Michael R. Gates's review in this site stating:

Several DVD editions of A BOY AND HIS DOG have been available over the past few years, and all have delivered good letterbox widescreen digital transfers.  THE CURRENT OFFERING FROM FIRST RUN FEATURES IS AN ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN VERSION,  and it also contains an interesting feature commentary and theatrical trailers.

In fact, the currect offering is not anamorphic, but letterboxed - and purchasing a DVD with a film in 2.35:1 aspect ratio that is letterboxed is a great mistake as you will only see the movie in a very small portion of your screen making it not a pleasant experience.  Even if you zoom it up - the grain becomes a problem.

I called First Run Features and they tell me that they have not changed the presentation of this film on DVD since they have distributed it - and it is, indeed, letterboxed.  There is no anamorphic version from First Run Features they tell me as of March 2011 and they did not know of any near future plan to release an anamorphic version.

So, there it is.  If Mr. Gates can tell me where I can get an anamorphic version of the film - please let us all know.  I would be one of the first to get it, as this is a very original, and great film.",1301443200,,1563,4.4734982332155475

1230558,4,B00000IXPN,"Years after WW4 decimated the earth you're stuck in a post-apocalyptic, wasteland.  After food and water, what is next on the list of ""necessities"" for a lonely survivalist?  Well, if you're Vic (Don Johnson), the obvious answer is sex.  Lucky for him he has a telepathic link with a pet dog named Blood who is willing to traverse the desert landscape and sniff out the feminine scent.

Despite the dire situation, A Boy & His Dog plays out as more of a dark comedy than anything else.  The constant sarcastic exchanges between a dense human and genius dog - voiced dryly and hilariously by Tim McIntire - carry the movie from beginning to end, and through a few slow moments on the hunt for women.  When Vic and Blood encounter nomadic villains and scheming seductresses, the action or plot advance only as far as dialogue can carry.  Johnson acts nearly solo the entire movie, and does so admirably, but Jason Robards provides a reserved performance as the ruler of a warped subterranean society.

Somehow this movie about a serial rapist and his mutant dog is charming, even if the charm isn't expected - which is why it's often referred to as a cult classic.  There are definitely filming and transfer issues, but neither dates or distracts.  Ultimately the movie is just an odd perspective of dystopian future that paved the way for films like Road Warrior and Postman.  Stick around until the ending, when Blood utters one of the funniest closing comments in movie history (sums up the movie perfectly).

Not necessarily Don Johnson movies, or ones with Harlan Ellison screenplays (though the latter are probably few); ones which are actually controversial. Sure, it suffers from the usual urban screenwriter paranoia about middle America (can't we make a dystopia where the masses are oppressed by the nightmare world of urban screenwriters? that sounds a lot closer to the truth than making middle American life, which doesn't even exist any more, look sinister). Sure it's going to offend the deeply politically correct, who think that women are all snowflakes and bunny rabbits and nature's aristocrats. It will also offend people who think Science Fiction means lots of dumb special effects. Probably, this is why such movies don't get made any more; no constituency.
This movie is arguably one of the most important in science fiction, mostly because Mad Max stole the aesthetics from this film. Yet, nobody has heard of it, and it remains obscure and unloved, for the crime of making demands of the viewer.

1230563,4,B00000IXPN,"A Boy and His Dog is the hearwarming tale of....you'll never guess! Oh, right. The title. Well, this particular tale of the old-time cliche has telepathic canines, green glowing monsters (albeit unseen ones), cannibalism (of course), and semen-stealing underground societies with a mime-like face paint motif. Got your attention? Good. This is a post-apocalyptic science fiction tale for the ages based on the classic novella by Harlan Ellison and it's gooooood. I'm talking about a movie where the hero (Vic) exploits his partner, a telepathic and extremely intelligent (and snide) dog named Blood, to find women to rape. Vic gets the food, Blood finds the women. What a damn premise! Let me tell you, if I was in a post-apocalyptic wasteland a hyper-intelligent talking dog would be at the top of my list for partners. That or a vampire girl. A really hot vampire girl. Who is also a ninja. Wait, what was I talking about? Right. Post-apocalyptic stuff. The world Vic and Blood wander is an alternate Earth where the Kennedys were never assassinated which led to no less than three different presidents bearing the name. While the movie doesn't do the best job of explaining, choosing to simply explore the world while teasing the audience with bits of history that Blood attempts to bludgeon into his less-than-intelligent partner's head. Vic was born after the apocalypse so he has no sense of society outside of the wasteland. This is a damn great setup for a story.

 After arguing with Blood at a makeshift theater showing an old dirty movie (the dog likes his popcorn), Vic convinces his companion to reveal to him that there is a lady hidden in the audience. Turns out she's about damn sexy too. But they are going to have to fight for her. At this point, the film goes from insanely cool to meh. The final acts separate our two ""heroes"" (bad move) and reveal an insanely creepy underground society attempting to preserve the good ol' days. Or at least, a bizarre approximation of it. Naturally, this means religion. Lots of religion. Oddly enough, this part of the story takes up too much screentime while at the same time is not developed enough. It seems like it could be an interesting story unto itself, but in this particular film it feels like an interruption of our regularly-scheduled prgoram that isn't fleshed-out enough to justify itself. It kind of kills the awesome tone of the film a little although it would be a cool story given more development. Thankfully, the whole thing ends up worthwhile with one of the best and most joyously twisted ending of any film ever. If you see it coming, I will eat my keyboard.

While the tale has been criticized for misogyny, I feel that the world the story takes place in is one where even the heroes are bad people preying on those weaker than themselves and is meant as a statement on humanity as a whole. Having the protagonists on the hunt for girls to rape is not the most PC premise of all time, but it makes sense for the story and the world inhabited by that story. Don't let the fact that the only being (if any) considered worth saving is a dog fly over your head, either. In my mind, that's the premise and any misogyny is a means to that end.  A Boy and His Dog is a very entertaining film that makes up for what it lacks in effective exposition with attitude and humor. As far as visions of a post-apocalyptic future go, this is one of the coolest by far. I feel another half hour could have made this a five-star film, but as it is it is still a must-see. Ellison actually made a sequel to the story in graphic novel form (although turns out he did it literally to spite pushy fans), and I do believe I'll check that out.",1278720000,,3698,4.598484848484849

1230565,4,B00000IXPN,"Based on a Harlen Ellison novel, ""A Boy and his Dog"" is a cult classic that is part dark comedy, and part post-apocalypse sci-fi.  This is one movie where the more time that went by after I finished watching it the more I realized I enjoyed it.  ""AB&HD"" is set in a post-nuclear wasteland where people wander around attempting to survive in a ""Road Warrior"" type fashion; but also where pockets of society have sprung up underground in a quasi-dystopia state.

Don Johnson's character (""Vic"") wanders the surface...not as part of one of the bands of humans who've ganged up for protection...but rather Vic travels solo, with the exception of his dog who Vic can communicate with via telepathy.  The dog alternates between providing Vic helpful information, and making sarcastic quips- usually at Vic's expense (and often to Vic's consternation).  In addition to protection, one of the services Blood the dog provides is the ability to sniff out human females.  The state of the above-ground world and the ""dystopia"" society that crops up may or may not be a literal prediction of what is to come after nuclear annihilation. But then again who's to say what type of nutty cults or societies may pop up.

This is one of Don Johnson's earlier movies and one can certainly see rumors of his later characters like Sonny Crockett. In addition to Don Johnson and the voice of Blood the dog played by Tim McIntyre, other fine acting performances in the movie include Susanne Benton and Jason Robards, Jr.

Every viewer can decide for themselves how seriously to take this movie (but after all, it's about a talking dog...). Overall, this movie may not be for today's average movie-fan, but it's definitely enjoyable if you like cult classics and 60-80's ""B-type"" sci-fi's.  (warning- mild spoiler) As the movie progresses, no overt explanation is given as to why or how Don Johnson's character can communicate with the dog...whether Blood obtained this ability as part of the holocaust or whether there is something special about Vic, or whether Vic is just crazy and Blood's just a regular dog.  I personally think this adds to the humor that they don't bother trying to explain it..",1273622400,,2176,4.872628726287263

(God, two easy chairs in the back of a '54 Ford pickup, with a half rack of PBR and a fresh lid....life was good)
 Even with the PBR & some Doobers, I never thought this movie was much good, but I thought maybe 30+ years might improve it. Unfortunately, I'm SOL. I love post-apocalyptic fiction and Sci-Fi(except&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tank-Girl/dp/B000059H98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tank Girl</a>), and while I usually detest remakes, this is one that badly needs to be re-done, since Ellison's story was treated so badly. Actually, there are reports it's to be remade, but animated....oh goody, Disney & Pixar??
One reviewer on IMDB said ""The acting is very good as well. Don Johnson is, surprisingly, dead-on as the arrogant post-apocalyptic punk"". Wow, far out! I'd never realized that good acting included having almost the entire movie being dubbed- I kind of expect a bunch of tiny Oriental people to start running around screaming about ""Godzirra!!"". Johnson has never had a whole lot of acting chops, but Blood the dog totally outshines him here. I do have to say that Blood's ""lines"", voiced-over by Tim McIntire steal the show. They're great.

1230598,4,B00000IXPN,"Typically I do reviews for games, but I noticed this copy of ""A Boy and His Dog"" had a huge lack of support compared to the other copies being sold here on Amazon. The quality of this DVD format is fairly good for being a 1970s film. Most of the scenes were shot on dark sets, yet I could see everything clearly. That can't be said for all movies from this decade. It did not look as crisp as the ""Planet of The Apes"" DVD conversion, another movie from the 70s, but then again ""Planet of the Apes"" was a Hollywood hit from the get-go. ""A Boy and His Dog"" was B-grade back then and still is today. By the way, there are no special features on this DVD and the movie can only be viewed in standard 4:3 format.

As for the movie itself; it's exactly what my title says it is. The world has been decimated by Atomic bombs and humanity is stretched thin. I guess nothing can grow, because everyone scavenges for canned food left behind by the old world. Canned food is also the currency. Without it, you cannot survive or buy yourself admission into a barricaded movie theater under the stars in the middle of a vast wasteland. People will even work for canned food.

Aside from hunger, other stubborn human needs never seem to die, such as sex. Women are as scarce as food, yet they are only worth having just once since keeping one for yourself would be a constant battle with other sexually deprived assailants. Dogs are used to sniff women out of hiding.

Speaking of dogs, the K9 in this movie is also one of the 3 main stars. Another thing, it talks to its owner, or...at least the owner believes the dog can talk. Whether or not the owner has lost his mind from scavenging the wasteland for too long, I don't know, but their personalities are complete opposites, and they are constantly arguing with each other. The boy acts more on his emotions while the dog is more concerned with maintaining their survival and their little squabbles are pretty darn funny.

Eventually, the boy becomes infatuated with this woman, and despite the protests of his dog, he follows her into an underground bomb shelter whose inhabitants have preserved somewhat the society and culture of the old world, and down there he gets himself into a whole heap of trouble. Years of surviving the world topside lent him the skills to survive the ordeal and we learn that if no one can be trusted in a world gone sour, a boy can always depend on the loyalty of his dog.",1235692800,,2443,4.4222222222222225

Vic's main goals are to find food and sex and Blood helps him with both...Although more of the sex one.  Its kind of funny actually that the dog kind of ""sniffs out"" females for his master.

Humanity has reverted to a sort of cro-magnum mindset (Food, sleep and sex are the 3 essentials of life) and that's suits the two friends fine, until one ""outing"" turns into an ordeal unto it's self.

It is a fantastic cult science fiction classic and model of post-apocalyptic film making. Deft touches of humor abound. The back lists it as an inspiration for Mad Max.

A Boy and His Dog is the story of Vic/Albert, and his dog Blood as they eke out their living in the Southwest wastelands of post World War IV. Blood is a lot smarter than Vic and communicates with him telepathically.

Vic is played by Don Johnson, after he had made 3 earlier films and was about to make 5 or 6 tv pilots before landing Miami Vice. If you have a low opinion of Don Johnson's talent I believe this film will change your mind. I will give no more of the plot away, but I have to say if the ending surprises you then you missed the point of the picture.

The dog's training and voiceover is as much responsible for the success of this film as anything else. The voice of Tim McInire fits perfectly for the dog's character and was magnificently acted/voiced. The best lines are given to Blood (""Once more into the breach, dear friends""). The dog was phenonomenal. When the (voice of the) dog is talking the animal's posture and movement are perfect. I found out in the commentary that the pooch's trainer got together before the shooting and transferred control of the animal over to Don Johnson. Therefore during the movie it would not look to its trainer for guidance, but to Don instead.

""A Boy and His Dog"" (1975) is based on a well-known novella by Harlan Ellison of the same title.  The movie focuses of the adventures of a young scavenger Vic (Don Johnson) and his telepathic dog Blood as they wander through the  wasteland where Phoenix, Arizona used to be in 2024 AD after the end of WWIV that resulted in nuclear holocaust. In their duet, Blood seems more intelligent, experienced, sarcastic, and reasonable than Vic but they need each other to survive, to find food for both and the girls for Vic.  All females have moved underground where a parody on pre-war suburban middle class life has been preserved and it has been over six weeks since Vic got laid last. Blood will sense a girl who dressed like a boy to attend the screening of an old porn-movie and Vic will follow her as far as the underground city ""Topeka"" against the Blood's advices. Little he knew that Quilla June was supposed to lure him down under where he will be used as a source for sperm that the underground women desperately need to get pregnant. After series of adventures, Vic was able to break away from the scary looking machine he was hooked up to with Quilla June's help and two of them escape to the surface...

While technically, the movie is not the most spectacular or visually prominent, the acting of the main characters, the communication between a boy (good performance from young and very  handsome Don Johnson) and his dog (Tim McIntire was very convincing providing the voice of ""Blood"" and singing the main title song, ""A Boy and His Dog""), and especially the story, dark and funny, make it well deserving of its cult status.

I wanted to see the movie because I am very impressed by Ellison's writings and consider some of his short stories the best, the most brilliant, incredible, shocking, and  disturbing  ever written.  The first one I read literally took my breath away. It was ""The whimper of the whipped dogs"" that I found in the thick volume ""The Best American Mystery Stories of the Century"" and it was the brightest star among the works of such writers as O'Henry, John Steinbeck, William Faulkner, Patricia Highsmith, Joyce Carol Oates, and many more. Since my first encounter with Ellison's writing, I became his loyal fan. Later, I read Ellison's collection ""Deathbird Stories: A Pantheon Of Modern Gods"" which ""The whimper of the whipped dogs"" opens. While reading the story that gave the book its title, ""The Deathbird"", I first learned about ""A Boy and His Dog"":

""Yesterday my dog died. For eleven years Ahbhu was my closest friend. He was responsible for my writing a story about a boy and his dog that many people have read. He was not a pet, he was a person. It was impossible to anthropomorphize him, he would not stand for it. But he was so much his own kind of creature, he had such a strongly formed personality, he was so determined to share his life with only those he chose, that it was impossible to think of him as simply a dog.""
-Harlan Ellison ""Ahbhu"", the short story inserted in ""The Deathbird""

After having read ""The Deathbird"", I was not surprised with the ending of ""A Boy and A Dog"", the story and the movie. Even though, they are attributed to the genre of science-fiction satire (and they are, intelligent, sharp, sarcastic, and biting), I think of them more as the  meditation on many important subjects and the tribute Ellison paid to the true friendship, loyalty, and love. He also  could've brought to the story resentment and disappointments from his broken marriages and relationships.",1182816000,,3587,4.700159489633174

And despite Amazon's description, this release is NOT ANAMORPHIC, though, like the others, it is widescreen. (I've submitted a change to the description).  I could live with the dust and scratches -- after all, all the known prints of this film have been knocking around for almost thirty years, and as far as I know no pristine negative exists anymore.  But I *wish* we could get an anamorphic transfer.  How is it that a Hugo award-winning film that is so loved by critics can be overlooked for a decent DVD treatment for so long?

Now, the good:  In addition to the now-familiar (and very entertaining) L.Q. Jones commentary track which has appeared on all the others, we also get two trailers restored to the DVD (these appeared on the first release, but not the one from Slingshot).  And the fact that it is available once again at all -- I didn't relish the idea of shelling out ~$100 if something happened to current copy.  Kudos to Firstrun for printing 'em again.

To this day, however, I can't figure out what was supposed to have happened at the end, and I watched the picture 5 times.

The dog grumbles about not getting any food while the boy grumbles about not getting any.  Oh yeah, they also happen to communicate with each other telepathically.  Strange?  You bet!

Set in 2024 A.D. following World War IV, the pair survive by scavenging a desert wasteland for food, stealing what they can.  Meanwhile, they are secretly monitored by shadowy members of an underground community who have more sinister plans in mind.

Filmed in 1975 on a low budget (the sets consist of junkyards emptied into the desert near Barstow), the picture succeeds because it is visually compelling throughout.

1230655,4,B00000IXPN,"""A Boy And His Dog"" is definately a cult classic, but defies being more neatly categorized beyond that genre. It's been labeled alternately and collectively as being ""misogynistic"", ""the greatest Science Fiction movie ever made"", ""black comedy"", and as a ""cross between George Orwell and Mel Brooks"" (the last description is my personal favorite), to list a few. Although it is true that the film is rather misogynistic, I don't find this a fault; the film is supposed to be portraying a terrible, possible future reality. And it may not be nice, folks.

""A Boy And His Dog"" was directed by L.Q. Jones, a character bit actor favored by Sam Peckinpah for his westerns, and is based on the novella of the same name by Sci-Fi legend Harlan Ellison (who by all accounts loved the film version).

It takes place in the year 2024, after WWIV has ravaged the earth's civilization, rendering it into a post-apocalyptic desert, where humans have become complete scavengers. A very young, relatively unknown Don Johnson (way before his days in TV's ""Miami Vice"") stars as Vic, a young ""solo"" as the loners are called, trying to stay alive in this post-atomic desert of a world. Veteran actor Jason Robards appears in a small part, as a favor to Jones. Vic's companion, friend and mentor is a sheepdog named Blood. The dog, named Tiger in real life, was a very popular animal actor of the times, an extremely well-trained and appealing performer, and in fact was the family dog on the TV show ""The Brady Bunch.""

Vic and Blood share a special bond, and the two communicate telepathically.

Don't laugh at that last remark; it's done very well in the film.

An element that could have ruined the film if not done carefully is, however, handled perfectly. Although it was suggested that animation be used to make it appear as if the dog's mouth is moving, thankfully none was used, and Tiger's masterful ""acting"", combined with the scruffy, gravelly, world-weary, old-west ""voice"" provided by Tim McIntire makes for some of the best acting in the film, and some of the best lines. Blood literally sniffs out women for Vic to have sex with, helps Vic be on the lookout for other packs of scavengers trying to kill him and each other in the ongoing fight over food and women, and Vic does the shooting, and the foraging for food. In addition the two are best friends, with Blood being the most intelligent by far. It seems that in the future, people have become the real animals.

The elements of caustically dark humor and dry dialogue (the dog gets the best lines) helps carry the film. And while this is in no way ""the best Science Fiction movie ever made"", in my opinion, it's certainly a great one, along with others of its time such as ""Soylent Green"". There are practically no special effects; the scenery and sets are cheap and minimalist, letting the characters and script tell the story, for the most part. This isn't a happy-happy-joy-joy overly-laden with special effects film like many of the ones made these days.

In case this whole scenario seems reminiscent of another film, ""Mad Max"", it's true that ""A Boy And His Dog"" inspired ""Mad Max"". I myself find this film to be superior, even if, and maybe in spite of, the fact that it is far less politically correct.

WARNING:  SPOILER FOLLOWS!

When Vic conveniently meets a young (and suspiciously clean and friendly) woman named Quilla June (portrayed by Susanne Benton), she pulls him in and the lure of frequent sex with her blinds him to Blood's warnings. So when Quilla June disappears Vic follows her to her underground community of Topeka, where he finds a warped reality of futuristic country living, combined with creepy clown makeup and aw-shucks country clothing. Its trio of self-anointed rulers is called The Committee, (this is where Jason Robards comes in), and they have a plan in mind for the young, able-bodied Vic. This all makes for a riveting scenario that's part ""Stepford Wives"", part ""Hee-Haw"", and more than a pinch of ""The Twilight Zone"". Beyond this, I will say no more except that the ending of the film is one of the best parts of the entire movie.",1114387200,,4127,4.743375174337517

1230668,5,B00000IXPN,"In the annals of low budget, post apocalyptic science fiction, you would be hard pressed to find a film stranger than director L.Q. Jones's cinematic adaptation of Harlan Ellison's ""A Boy and His Dog."" Here is a film that fairly screams cult classic despite its rather unexceptional backstory. In the year 2024 (or thereabouts), humanity teeters on the brink of ultimate destruction. Not one but two nuclear conflagrations have reduced most of the planet's denizens to scruffy, underfed ruffians. Why did the wars in this movie occur? Who knows? During the Cold War we all expected a nuclear exchange to break out any day over any number of reasons. Perhaps the Soviet Union would invade Western Europe. Maybe the United States and Russia would exchange volleys seeking control of Persian Gulf oil. Even a spark in a third world nation presented humanity with the threat of utter annihilation back in those days. One could argue that the nuclear threat hasn't gone away today since both the United States and Russia still possess arsenals. Even worse, proliferation means other countries with far less self-control already have or will soon have the bomb. Whatever the reasons for nuclear war, they are far less important in this film than life afterwards.

Vic (Don Johnson) roams the blasted plains of post-apocalyptic America with his trusty pooch Blood. Interestingly and weirdly enough, the two are able to communicate through a psychic link obviously brought about by too much exposure to radiation. Boy and dog spend all of their time looking for food, a challenge in a world where supermarkets tend to lie under tons of atomically fused soil and where one must battle roving packs of pirates for a can or two of preserved fruit. More important than procuring food is Vic's desire for locating women, any women but good-looking ones are better, in order to fulfill age old desires. It is this food/female combination that forms the central tenet of Vic's relationship with Blood and vice versa. The dog can quite literally sense the presence of women in the area, much to Vic's delight, but Blood insists on food before disclosing the location of the female in question. Blood's demands frequently result in flaring tempers, heated exchanges, and elaborate negotiations, but both eventually get what they want and, more importantly, possess an extreme loyalty to one another when the chips are down. A good example comes when weird shrieking creatures arrive on the scene and Blood helps Vic escape from them as well as from a band of hostile men. It's good to have such a loyal companion in this post-apocalyptic world.

Sadly, it takes a strange series of events for Vic to learn how important Blood is to his well being. Predictably, the trouble starts with a woman, a very attractive woman by the name of Quilla June Holmes (Susanne Benton). After Blood sniffs her out for his buddy Vic, Holmes lures our young hero into what can only be described as a dystopia that would give George Orwell nightmares. It appears Vic has a very special trait highly sought after by Topeka, an underground society led by Lou Craddock (Jason Robards) and a couple of other people, and that trait is fertility. Vic's vital fluids will help this community repopulate itself, but the whole thing isn't as much fun as it sounds. First, these people are weird on a metaphysical level. The whole community strives to reproduce a vision of America, but it looks like they culled their ideas about the pre-war United States from books written in the 1950s. Marching bands and picnics form the crux of the society's activities, and people wear attire that makes them look like parodies of American regional types. Second, these people look bizarre and act in strange ways. Craddock, along with the rest of the citizens, wears this hideous white pancake makeup that is truly frightening. Loudspeakers blare a constant litany of recipes and other news announcements. Yikes.

The conclusion to the film is downbeat yet fits perfectly with the off the wall antics of the preceding ninety minutes. And everything about ""A Boy and His Dog"" is off the wall. You want to see a pack of pirates digging for food in the desert? A bunch of folks watching a blue movie out in the middle of nowhere? Here's your film. This is such a strange jaunt into the realms of the odd that the idea of a human communicating with a dog seems perfectly normal. Speaking of Blood, it's the same dog that played Tiger in the Brady Bunch. The person voicing this animal is a real hoot, what with the off color limericks and world weary sarcasm that dominates his discussions with Vic. For his part Don Johnson does remarkably well in a role that requires him to act opposite an animal in a believable way. It is Jason Robards, however, who steals every scene he is in as the tyrannical Lou Craddock. Everyone knows this actor was a real talent, but it's nice to see him take on such an offbeat role. I always like an actor or actress who steps outside the conventional, and Robards definitely does that here.

Extras on the disc aren't plentiful. There's a trailer, of course, that tries to play up the controversial elements of the film. The real treat is the commentary with L.Q. Jones; he discusses every element of the movie from the low budget to working with Robards. One intriguing anecdote involves the scene where Craddock eats the sandwich while talking with his associates. Jones relates with great glee how the sandwich was rotten yet Robards refused to interrupt the scene in any way to voice his displeasure. That's professionalism carried to the nth degree, wouldn't you say? ""A Boy and His Dog"" might not appeal to many viewers, but it's definitely worth watching for the cult film fan.",1108857600,,5757,4.835699797160244

Well, whether you would or not, that was definitely me. All I heard about this movie was that it was set during a time when the Earth was ravaged and that the movie was about a hungry/horny boy with his faithful dog who complains about his libido all the time.

What came to my mind was an image of a 13-14 year old boy and a dog wandering around the desert looking for something to do. Of course, if I had known this movie got an ""R"" rating, a more accurate image would have come to my head.

I was very surprised by this movie. Aside from the fact that the movie shows pornography and rape, it also portrayed the main character as some kind of a sex addict. Since I had originally thought the movie had a ""PG"" rating, I didn't even think it had any of these.

I found myself stumbling upon a very strange movie, indeed. You could clearly see that this is from a non-PC time because aside from the fact that it shows women as sex objects, it also shows the main character choosing his dog over a woman that claims ""she loves him"". Now, aside from that, he does something that women today would consider VERY sexist. I thought it was cool as hell, but hey, that's me.

Anyway, a number of things got me confused about this movie. Now, of course there would be very little people, but why are there so much less women? Did the men have some sort of gene that allowed them to survive nuclear war better? Aside from that, why did they kill women so frivolously if women were in short supply? None of it seems to make any sense to me. The thing that really hit me, though, was the lack of commitment in EVERYONE. Considering the human race seemed to be on the verge of extinction if something wasn't done fast, why were so little committed to having children? Food didn't seem to be a factor since one scene showed them giving away food in order to see a pornography movie. Was wondering the desert with your pals digging up old cans of food so much fun that you didn't want to bother having children to make sure your species don't go extinct?

Of course, that is just the gist of it. There seems to be A LOT of unexplained or unplausible stuff in this movie, but then again, you're probably not watching this movie for the plausibility.

Despite the strangeness, I actually like this movie. It was fun seeing the teen kid argue with his dog about women. It certainly was touching to see how loyal they are to each other. How many guys today would give up a woman for their dog? Even if the woman was a conniving wench and the dog was loyal beyoung belief? Not many, I bet.

Overall, I consider this movie to be excellent! Pick it up if you can. It's very good.",1100390400,,2866,4.255514705882353
1230672,5,B00000IXPN,"It's the year 2024, and most of the Earth's nations have been demolished by yet another world war (the latest being WWIV).  In this postapocalyptic world, slow-witted survivor Vic (Don Johnson) forages through the ruins for food and women with the help of his faithful dog, Blood (voiced by Tim McIntire), with whom he is able to communicate telepathically.  Blood, more intelligent and more cultured than his young ""master,"" often gets impatient with Vic's immature behavior and lack of interest in his attempts to educate the boy, but he nonetheless loves Vic and sticks with him to help him survive. And after several minor adventures and one huge misadventure, Vic does learn one incontestable actuality: Nothing is more important to a boy than his dog.
Based on an award-winning novella by the curmudgeonly SF writer Harlan Ellison, A BOY AND HIS DOG was adapted and directed by character actor L.Q. Jones and co-produced by Jones and Alvy Moore (the latter probably best known for his portrayal of scatterbrained Hank Kimball on TV's GREEN ACRES).  While Ellison has said many times publicly that the film is the most faithful adaptation of any of his works, he has nonetheless complained vehemently about some of Jones' ""adjustments""--most notably the minor addition of some gross or vulgar dialogue--and tried unsuccessfully to get them changed.  Whether or not Ellison's complaints have merit, A BOY AND HIS DOG has come to be regarded as a science-fiction classic, its popularity undoubtedly due to its likeable characters who, despite their constant bickering and individual quirks, are redeemed by their committed friendship and their sarcastically humorous approach to survival.
The performances in A BOY AND HIS DOG are top-notch.  Johnson convincingly portrays Vic as a filthy scavenger who, in spite of his dire situation, still manages to remain a decent human being at the core.  Tim McIntire's vocal characterization of Blood embodies Ellison's original concept of a mutant pooch with a caustic ego that is balanced with just the right amount of off-beat humanity, and this portrayal is enhanced further by the outstanding on-screen performance of Tiger, the canine thespian that portrayed the family pet on TV's THE BRADY BUNCH.  In his supporting role as the governor of a subterranean dystopia, Jason Robards is delightfully smarmy.  And when beautiful Susanne Benton bares her ample ""talents"" on the screen, that's a lot of fun watch, too.
With A BOY AND HIS DOG, Jones' intention is not to make deep socio-political innuendos or to meet the average action-fan's prosaic expectations, and sentimentality is obviously far from his mind.  Instead of serving up a dull postapocalyptic survival-of-the-fittest thriller or a clich love-among-the-ruins drama, Jones gives us a wry black comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously.  His direction is tight, his staging often inventive, and the dialogue--while MOSTLY lifted directly from Ellison's story--is often sharply sardonic and frequently witty.  With this AND the outstanding performances he elicits from his cast, Jones creates a realistic world of future desolation, but he peoples it with central characters that learn to deal with the nightmare while still maintaining their humanity...and a sense of humor.
Several DVD editions of A BOY AND HIS DOG have been available over the past few years, and all have delivered good letterbox widescreen digital transfers.  The current offering from First Run Features is an anamorphic widescreen version, and it also contains an interesting feature commentary and theatrical trailers.
All in all, A BOY AND HIS DOG is a wonderful interpretation of a classic SF novella, and this DVD will make a great entry in the film collections of SF fans who love quirky non-mainstream films.",1078790400,,3801,5.264462809917355
1230673,4,B00000IXPN,"It may not be a perfect adaptation (actually, only the robotic ""Michael,"" the strange pumping machine, and the last line of the film are major differences), but it fares much better than I thought it might when I first had a look.  It is low-budget, but the interplay between man and beast, as well as some surprisingly good acting, make up for the lack of funds.  It could have been very bad.  I've noticed in my screenings of this film for friends, that women tend to dislike the film very much.  This could have a lot to do with the ending, which despite what a previous reviewer has said, is quite unambiguous and easy to understand (my 61-year-old mother got it, and actually liked the film).  The ending, which is a bit shocking at first, simply fails to fully evoke Ellison's original, more subtle approach.
Harlan Ellison, a man not easily pleased by adaptations (especially of this story, arguably his most personal--at least at the time), has said he really likes this film, but the last line bugs the heck out of him.  For those of you who haven't read the story, you should know that Vic never took a bite at the end.  He did what he had to do for Blood, but couldn't bring himself to eat.

1230674,4,B00000IXPN,"This pre-""Mad Max"" low budget sci-fi, based on a novella by Harlan Ellison, has gathered quite a devoted cult following over the years, in addition to spawning a (by now overworked) movie subgenre. A youthful Don Johnson wanders a post-nuclear outback, chock-a-block with the requisite mutants and ruffians, ever on the prowl for food and sex. Oh, did I mention ""the dog""? The voice-over work by actor Tim McIntire, ostensibly ""as the dog"", steals the movie at every turn and undoubtedly cemented the film's cult status (it certainly wasn't Johnson's rather workmanlike performance). By turns annoyingly amateurish and brilliantly inspired, the film ultimately generates a certain kinky charm-in a guilty pleasure, pre-P.C. era kind of a way (Johnson's glorified serial rapist undoubtedly earns the film few feminist admirers). It's a ""love it or hate it"" scenario, and those already devoted will not be swayed. DVD notes (2003 reissue edition): The (widescreen) transfer itself is decent; unfortunately the print it was taken from is, shall we say, ""less than pristeen"". The audio is mono and still quite tinny, but a bit improved over previous VHS versions and cable airings.

This movie gives its main character two choices, life in a desert wasteland surrounded by roaming tribes of savages, or life underground enslaved by the rements of the old regime who enforce their will through androids. The Telepathic dog is by far the best character in the movie and has the best lines, vainly trying to give Don Johnson's character history lessons. This movie paints an exagerated but bascially accurate potrait of the world we live in, people are either dominated by fascist regimes that exploit their citizens, or live in wild, chaotic, untamed areas where different tribes or groups steal from and kill each other. Either slavery or an extreemly dangerous freedom are the choices the chacters in this movie are presented with, and it is that really so different from the world we live in? We are either corporate slaves or outlaws, one or the other. Some people might call these a simplistic world view but they would be wrong and I would be right. In this movie Don Johnson can trust no one but his dog, is that so different from real life? This movie is clever and disturbing, thought provoking and interesting. The first of its genre.",1058400000,,2345,4.677966101694915
1230989,2,B00000IXPN,"I despised the main character, a nomadic rapist.  There was nothing at all worthwhile about him.  The movie sets him up as being a survivor only by very contrived writing.  He is able to raid a gang only because the gang is the apocalyptic equivalent of the Keystone Cops.  He waves his gun around in town - this will get a loner shot 100% of the time.
The ""choice"" he makes between the girl and the dog is also contrived.  If you actually stop to think for a moment (warning, having a mind and using it destroys any chance of ejoying this film!), he had plenty of choices (there was food right behind that door if he made a quick raid).
Frankly, the only way I can see that this movie would have any appeal is if your emotional development stopped at 12, and you like having sex with women, but really dislike women themselves.",1035763200,,828,4.316129032258065
1230990,4,B00000IXPN,"Don Johnson plays ""Vic"", the boy of the title and the brawn of a due led by a telepathic and psychotic dog named ""Blood"".  After more global thermonuclear wars than anybody can count, America is a wasteland, covered up by mud.  The remains of most cities are buried under ground, as are most of the products (canned peaches being a favorite; weapons and ammo and porno films also being top draws) that postwar denizens actively seek.  Blood, we learn, was one of the technological innovations of the wars - an intelligent if still vicious animal bonded telepathically to a human to form a hunter-killer team.  With the wars over, the wasteland is covered with canine-human duos like Vic and Blood - with the humans providing the muscle to find food and to protect the dogs.  In a set-up that gives a new spin to the term ""tail wagging the dog"", the canine half provides the real end of the team - Blood uses his telepathic powers to ""sniff"" out women, who in the post-apocalyptic setting are seen as fit for nothing but temporary pleasure.  Blood proves his worth early in the film when, while the two take in a porno flick along with dozens of other teams, Blood is the first to sense the nearby presence of a woman.  With Blood's help, Vic traps the seemingly virginal Quilla June.  Unfortunately the headstart isn't long enough, and Vic and Blood find themselves in a firefight over the woman, too embroiled with the other HK teams to realize that Quilla June has plans of her own - plans for Vic that don't include Blood or the wanderers' life that is the only existence Vic knows of.
""A Boy and His Dog"" (aka ""Psycho Boy and His Killer Dog, Blood"") is a pretty thin story, which is why it's the director's credit that the flick is just so much fun.  The settings are cheap, but not unconvincing - it could very well have been filmed by denizens of the post-apocalypse.  This could very well have been one of the movies filmed for the fun of the rape-teams (they would've severely dissed the lack of gratuitous sex and nudity, but the flick ends on a subtly shocking dark joke, one they'd definitely appreciate).  In any event, the flick beats any of the similarly themed and more expensive flicks (barring the ""Road Warrior"" flicks, but definitely including ""The Postman"").  Beyond the novelty of a young Don Johnson, you've got the sarcastic and bloodthirsty reparte of  whoever plays the voice of ""Blood"", though I'd see this again Sussanne Benton who, as Quilla June, manages to be emulate innocence, ambition and seduction very well.  I've seen this flick on TV once - and that was back in 1987.  If you want to see this flick again, you're not going find it on TNT.",1024790400,,2675,4.590336134453781

Based on a Harlan Ellison novella, the story wazs actually entertaining!
Robards plays the leader of a cult. A judeo Christian cult who claims the hero, Don Johnson, for their own. He is to impregnate the women, the males having all become sterile. Don Johnson falls in 'love' with a member of the cult, and facilitates his love by sharing her meat with his dog!

1230993,3,B00000IXPN,"Like many artifacts of the 60s & 70s, y'hadda be there...at least in order to feel a protective fondness for what is without question a very flawed movie. The miracle of this film was that it was made AT ALL. (Due in no small part to the tenor of the times it sprang from. The shackles on pop culture and genre fiction were loosening, allowing for more serious themes and treatment; of course, two years later STAR WARS would tighten the shackles again.) I'm a little amazed at the many posters bitching about cheap sets, poor fx, etc. Does everyone watch a movie EXPECTING a 50-million-dollar budget and CGI up the wazoo? If so, we're in deeper trouble than I thought. I look at A BOY AND HIS DOG with great affection as a sincere attempt to do something different, provocative and heartfelt, and although it's informed by a naive leftist worldview I don't share, there's a great deal of audacious creativity at work here that transcends many of the budgetary limitations. You'd think oddities like this would be treasured as artifacts of a more open and experimental period in movie history, rather than derided for falling short of INDEPENDENCE DAY's store-bought bombast and opticals.

1230994,4,B00000IXPN,"Ok, so technically this is one awful film.  The director just had a low budget.  The concept however is great.  Vic, a young loner in a post-apocalyptic world travels with his telepathic dog in a symbiotic relationship searching for food and women.  The harshness of the above ground post-nuclear nightmare is contrasted with the absurdly conformist underground community of 'Topeka' where painted smiles, plaid shirts, family values and hypocrisy rule.  Vic is forced to choose between a Roussean (absolute institutional power) or Burkean (no institutions) nightmare.  His choice, and its expression will leave you with either a gasp or chuckle, but you'll be glad you saw this quirky yet thoughtful film.",1002240000,,706,5.315315315315315
1230995,3,B00000IXPN,"This 1975 film takes only the bare bones from Harlan Ellison's novella, forgoing its final proof of how much a boy can love his dog.  What is left is Don Johnson as Vic, the young post-apocalyptic loner and his telepathic dog Blood (Yes, that is Benji, boys and girl), who eventually meets a girl from an underground community where Jason Robards and the folks are clinging really hard to the old ways.  If you have not read Ellison's original story you can probably suffer through this film, provided you have plenty of stuff to eat and drink.  It was certainly remind you of the old days, when low budget meant the film was probably made by a schlockmaster and not and independent auteur.  But if you know what the answer was to Quilla June's question, ""Do you know what love is,"" this disappointing film will ring hollow.
Tim McIntire, who did the voice of ""Blood"" also had the honors of singing the main title song, ""A Boy And His Dog.""  This movie, also known as Psycho Boy and His Killer Dog, was directed by L. Q. Jones, who appears as an actor in the porno film Vic and Blood are watching.  Except for some work on the television series ""The Incredible Hulk,"" Jones never directed again after this one.",982627200,,1210,4.502283105022831
1230996,4,B00000IXPN,"First, I really like this movie for lots of reasons.  It's tough to grade it with stars.  Maybe 4 stars is accurate.  It wisely switches gears in the middle with a weird setting change.  Very affective to keep it interesting.  And...it has one of my favorite endings of all time.  Quite shocking!  Don Johnson was a good choice for the lead.  He was a natural this early in his carear.  Kevin Coster only wishes Waterworld and Postman were this good (and at a fraction of the cost...ha ha!). This is just a good sci-fi movie.
3 out of 5 stars for the DVD presentation.  I didn't expect the picture quality to be very good when I bought this and low expectations paid off.  It's a mixed bag with the first half of the film being in the worst shape.  It's a shame that better quality prints don't exist (or DO they?).  But, what's here isn't that bad.  The sound is okay too.
Extras:  2 great trailers stuck on the end (the first one is my favorite because it doesn't give the movie away).  Also, audio commentary from the director L.Q. Jones & some other folks that worked on the film.  I thought it was funny when ""Q"" said that Blood the dog was almost nominated for a ""best supporting actor"" Oscar and somebody said: ""Best supporting dog?""
The DVD case gives part of the movie away on the back so don't read until you've seen the flick at least once.
If you like low budget sci-fi with a first-rate story and good cast...or if you have a furry best friend of your own then ""A Boy And His Dog"" is worth trading a few cans of peaches for!",981158400,,1537,4.28125
1230997,5,B00000IXPN,"While I give this *movie* 5 stars, I was disappointed in this DVD  presentation and would give it 3 stars.  The film-to-DVD transfer is of  marginal quality, and the source was in terrible shape (dirty and badly  scratched).  Either they didn't use the original film master, or it has  deteriorated badly over the past several years.
I personally found the  director's commentary disappointing as well.  IMHO, L.Q. spends too much  time discussing high level approaches to general film making, and not  enough time detailing the specifics of the AB&HD filming.  If you, like  I, hang on directors' commentaty for copious quantites of behind-the-scenes  trivia, little known facts, and explanations, you may be greatly  disappointed.  If, on the other hand, you don't care for play by play  discussions of the film, you might not mind.  I was also disappointed that  the DVD contained no supplemental information about the novella on which  the movie is based.
In all, a brilliant story by Elison, brilliant  screenplay and directing by L.Q. Jones, so-so DVD presentation.",968716800,,1071,5.152046783625731

The dialog between Vic (Don  Johnson) and Buck (the dog) was classic, especially the history lessons on  presidents (Kennedy-Kennedy-Kennedy; thank God that never panned out!).  Suzanne Benton does a great striptease in reverse.  And is it just me, or  does 'Michael', the killer android from 'downunder' look like Alan 'The  Skipper' Hale Junior?  Funny, sexy, and ultraviolent, this movie is a cult  classic, to use the purest definition of the term.  The moral, such as it  is: beets are better for you anyway.

1231019,4,B00000IXPN,"A cult favorite for years, this faithful version of Harlan Ellison's classic novella enjoyed some mainstream popularity in the mid-'80s when its star, Don Johnson, hit the big time with ""Miami Vice."" In recent  years the movie has settled back into cult status, which is for the best.  Johnson (in an excellent performance) is Vic, a simple-minded survivalist  who wanders what's left of post-apocalypse America with his dog Blood  (played by Tiger of ""The Brady Bunch,"" with voice by singer Tim  McIntire), with whom he has a telepathic bond. Vic's main ambition in life  is to, well, find female companionship; he demands that Blood sniff out  girls for him. He meets a seemingly innocent young woman who leads him down  to a strange subterranean civilization where all the men are sterile.  Eventually, Vic is presented with a hard choice. The decision he makes has  remained controversial; the one-liner that ends the film is even more so.  (Ellison didn't write the line and has expressed discomfort with it. I  think it's one of the great final lines in movie history.) If you haven't  seen this film, chances are you've seen a dozen better-known SF movies it  influenced (like the ""Mad Max"" series), and Kevin Costner's  ""The Postman"" was a windbag '90s variation on the same theme.

1231021,4,B00000IXPN,"Mid-70s post-nuclear apocalypse movies are not a genre I generally enjoy.  ""A Boy and His Dog"" (one of the first of the type) is the exception that proves the rule.
The shattered world above is not the  interesting part of this film, and it moves slowly for the first hour while  we're in it.  What keeps us watching is the great dialogue and interaction  between Vic (Doh Johnson) and his dog, Blood.  Vic and Blood can talk to  each other, and the dog is rather smarter than Vic.  Once we go  ""downbelow,"" into the survivalist enclave called  ""Topeka.""
One reason I didn't give this film 5 stars was the  slowness at the start; the other reason was the poor quality of the DVD  transfer.  If ever a movie cried out for remastering, this is it:  it  really does look like they just transferred it from VHS.  There is a  commentary track with film critic Charles Chaplin, director L.Q. Jones  (this was his last film directing), and John cinematographer Morrill.  It  makes for interesting listening.
