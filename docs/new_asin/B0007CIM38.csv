8046767,3,B0007CIM38,"KAIJU BIG BATTEL SHOCKING TRUTH (Koch Vision) is the follow up to the 2003 bizarro cult hit Terebi Sento.  The latest DVD release brings newbies into the Big Battel universe and encapsulates years of the in-ring monster mayhem storylines with its ""patented mix"" of action and comedy.

From safety of your home, protected by the TV screen, you can experience what thousands of awe-struck fans have witnessed at sold-out live Kaiju events.

And just what is a Kaiju event? Think WWE Smackdown meets Monty Python in which exuberant, weirdly costumed athletes stage elaborate, over the top ""fights"" in large, wrestling type rings. Using oversize movie props and stomping miniature cityscapes the combatants are surrounded by crazed, screaming fans. During each bout, the complex epic tale further unfolds.

Here's the set up:

Planet Earth is under threat. Scattered throughout the galaxy is a monstrous mob of maniacal villains, menacing alien beasts, and giant, city-crushing monsters that are waging war against one another. Presiding over this mayhem is the Kaiju Commissioner, an enigmatic human-arbiter appointed by a clandestine cadre of world leaders to regulate Kaiju rage. If the Kaiju Commissioner doesn't do his job perfectly the entire world could get caught in the crossfire.

At this writing, the Kaiju Universe maintains an active roster of about 40 monsters, including a blue alien-glutton named Sky Deviler, a factory-worker-turned-soup-can called Kung-Fu Chicken Noodle, a dirty hare-sage dubbed Dusto Bunny, Uchu Chu the Space Bug, and a despicable, square-headed mad scientist known as Dr. Cube.

In addition to the Kaiju Commissioner, a few other privileged humans also get a piece of the action, including Referee Jingi, a mustachioed official who enforces fairness and civility in the ring, Anthony Salbino, an urban renewal expert who reconstructs crumbled cityscapes between Battels, and one tuxedo-wearing, mouth-running MC, Louden Noxious.

Hope you got all that...

This DVD will initiate neophytes to the Kaiju universe and answer all your burning questions about these live, multi-media, tournament-style, character-driven, tongue-in-cheek performances that are a hybrid of American pro-wrestling, Japanese monster-movies, and lowbrow pop-culture.

Studio Kaiju is an independent Boston-based performance and media group.",1122940800,4,2348,5.663817663817664
