7918810,2,B00003E4E9,"I bought this box set because I had seen these episodes when I was very young and really like them at the time. Turns out that they voice acting on these videos is absolutly terrible. The inflection and traslations are very juvenile, much more so than I remembered. But then again, I was quite young last time I watched it.

The biggest problem that I ran into was the tracking. I have two VCRs with auto tracking and tried them on both and at least twice per episode the tracking would get so bad that the screen would go blank before the tracking could catch back up and the quality was pretty poor through out all of the episodes.

All in all, not bad, but I'm sending it back since since it wasn't what I was expecting between the quality of the video and the voice acting.",1219363200,,777,4.27891156462585
7918811,5,B00003E4E9,"This (along with STARBLAZERS and TRANSFORMERS) was HANDS DOWN my favorite cartoon series when I was a kid in the 80's... I think that this was only shown locally in the Northeast... This is where it's at for CLASSIC anime... it's hilariously quirky, has great plotlines, and an AWESOME funky soundtrack.

PLEASE RELEASE FORCE FIVE ON DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1169510400,,372,5.526315789473684
7918812,5,B00003E4E9,"I haven't seen this box set, but I have been fortunate enough to see the complete show of Grendizer. So, I'm not commenting on this box set, but I'm providing information only on the UFO Robot Grendizer, which was created by Go Nagai the creator of Mazinger.

Grendizer appeared for the first time in Arab World at the 80's as a complete two-season Arabic dubbed show. It gained a huge popularity among the Arab children in the 80s, especially because dubbed cartoons are very rare at that time. Grendizer popularity in Arab World even very much exceeded Mazinger's; especially in Saudi Arabia where Mazinger has never been shown on TV.

The show is still being aired occasionally on both Space Toon and ART Teens (free-to-air Arabic satellite channels) which can be received in Middle East, parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia on the Egyptian TV satellite (Nile Sat). Also VHS tapes for the complete show (19 tapes)are being sold in Saudi Arabia.",1098576000,,945,4.827160493827161
7918813,5,B00003E4E9,"While Robotech, Starblazers, Speed Racer and Kimba are all great old school anime, many have forgotten that the 70's was the sprouting decade for mecha anime. Now, the best of anime from the 70's is now chroincallized in this four tape set. Originally airing as a week block of animation called Force Five, these tapes are mega old school.
Spaceketeers.
Directed by the famous Leiji Matsumoto (Starblazers, Galaxy Express 999) and then just forgotten by all because it seems this wasn't the high point of Leiji's career. However, it is actually pretty good. There is no mecha in this saga however. It is more like Ronin Warriors in space. It starts out with the princess of an empire who is to free an evil android that will save her planet from the evil animal-aliens. The only problem was that this series is too short. Just when I was really getting into the story, they cut it off after only two episodes. I need more!
Starvengers.
Directed by Go Nagai, this series was known as Getter Robo G in Japan and was a sequel to Getter Robo. Fans of Getter Robo Armageddon will want to check out this tape to see where it all began. The story begins right after the third pilot of the old starvenger (or getter robo) is killed and unvails the new unit. The first two episodes introduce the enemy and the new team member quite well. Plus, the artwork is really great. However, some of the dubbing is a little stereotypical, but I'm surprised they would keep in the word kendo. How about that?
Grandizer.
Also directed by Go Nagai and also another sequel. This was the second sequel of Mazinger Z which has become very popular with many mecha fans and I can see why. It takes place in a western setting where a science institute has built special UFOs. However, new aliens have come to Earth to destroy it. And who better to fight them than an alien himself. Grandizer was really exciting! Two explosive battles on this tape.
Gaiking.
The last tape on the set is pretty much what you should expect from a mecha series. It's like Voltron fell into Dancougar. When a rookie baseball player fractures his throwing arm, he is called to a secret labratory as a possible candidate for piloting the Gaiking. Not all that exciting, but it's a fair series.
There were a lot of anime series that came out in the 70's and I can't count how many. But it was cool to see that America wasn't afraid to stick their hand in and grab a few. And with the exceptions of a few edits and hardmatted credits, these tapes are pretty much uncut! Plus, I gotta give Jim Terry props for including the creators names in the credits (most series before the 90's never did that). So go out and get some of the most classic anime of the 70's. Highly recommended!",1018828800,2,2727,4.5
