8427092,1,B004EJU4TU,"This video should be entitled ""How to turn your offense into hot garbage"". How do you take a returning National Champion team with all its parts and turn it into a dumpster fire of check down passes and jet sweeps? Ask Ed Warinner because he has mastered the art of sucking on offense. Buy this DVD if you hate football.",1483142400,,320,4.35
8427093,1,B004EJU4TU,"God awful product. Have you seen Warriner running Ohio State's offense into the ground? Their offensive line gave up 11 tackles for loss against Penn St. under his watch

Is that really someone you want to buy a ""How to block"" DVD from?

No",1477180800,,240,4.431818181818182
