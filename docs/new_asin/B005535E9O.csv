8457464,4,B005535E9O,"Mollie goes to college with the best of intentions, but an overwhelming part of the college experience isboys. Her parents aren't as keen on their daughters college experience and sexual awakening as is Mollie. This is a cute, engaging comedy from the 60s. Good acting all around. James Stewart is very good in comedy roles, and Sandra Dee does what she does best. It gets a little predictable and routine at times, but overall it serves its purpose well as an entertaining comedy. Worth a watch.",1468022400,,496,4.77906976744186
