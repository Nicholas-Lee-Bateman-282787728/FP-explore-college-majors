8284615,5,B001BSBBE4,"I purchased this film having seen the motion picture that came out some time ago, and was not sure what to expect. This is a very well made documentary that shows everything about Seabiscuit, from his birth and all through to his great races. Even if you never saw the major motion picture about the story of Seabiscuit  you will be entertained by yet another great release from Legend Films. A good one for the kids too, but maybe not the toddlers!! I gave this one a well earned 5 star rating.",1395964800,6,495,4.380434782608695
