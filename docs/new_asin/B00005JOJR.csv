1543182,5,B00005JOJR,"The Scarecrow and Mrs. King was one of the most unusal shows ever on television.  A housewife who becomes a spy.  Kate Jackson as the housewife looking for part-time work was hysterical. Bruce Boxlietner as the dashing, experienced intelligence operator and playboy and leading man, was charming.  The cast that supported the main characters, from Mrs. West, Amanda King's unawares and completly in the dark, mother to the head of the spy division, Billy Melrose were all good fun.  Yes there are car chases, yes there are shots fired, but there is also a lot of great writing, acting and creativity. And it is still a show you can show to the children without being bored yourself. It is time the series was released on DVD.",1128816000,21,725,4.73015873015873

1543184,5,B00005JOJR,"How Many People Have To Ask For It To Get It Released??????, September 4, 2006

43 people have now taken the time to review this show and ask for its release on dvd (including myself almost a year ago).I have already given up on Dynasty and Hart to Hart being released in their complete series runs and purchased each complete series (probably illegally) from another website. The quality wasn't the best,but at least I have seen Dynasty and Hart to Hart from beginning to end. It looks like I will have to do that with Scarecrow and Mrs. King too. I am tired of waiting for it to be released. It amazes me that shows that are still airing daily on television in repeats (and many of them lousy ones at that)are being released every week to dvd and yet a quality show such as this is being ignored!
.....................................

  MY ORIGINAL REVIEW............SEPTEMBER 2005
I have to agree with Michelle. I loved this show growing up and would order each and every season as soon as they were released. Good luck trying to find shows these days without blood and gore,horrific violence,mental or physical cruelty. This was a show the whole family could enjoy. I have already pre-ordered season 1 of Hart to Hart,so come on and release Scarecrow and Mrs. King next. PLEASE.",1127433600,155,1283,4.714285714285714
1543185,5,B00005JOJR,I just don't understand why scarecrow and mrs. king hasn't been released on DVD.  This is one of my all time favorite shows.  Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner were the best partners on the show. Come on I know I am not the only Scarecrow and Mrs. king fan out here.  They finally released Lois and Clark the new adventures of Superman on DVD then why can't they release Scarecrow and Mrs. King.,1127347200,164,395,4.383561643835616
1543348,3,B00005JOJR,"Scarecrow and Mrs. King?  Love them.  Recommend the show highly.  This particular DVD version?  Well - it'd be great, if only I could play it.  While it works fine with a regular DVD player, it won't play on my laptop because this DVD is copy protected, and attempting to play it on a computer apparently triggers some kind of failsafe.  The DVD doesn't even register as a visible disk in either a Mac or Windows computer, and won't play using Windows Media Player (Windows), DVD Player (Mac), QuickTime (Mac), or VLC (Mac/Windows).  Very disappointed.

Summary: If you plan on playing this disk in a regular DVD player, then go ahead and buy it.  If, like me, you only have a computer to watch movies on, then think twice.",1487548800,,723,4.5859375

1543715,5,B00005JOJR,"I am technically too young to have really watched this on television, but my Mom used to watch reruns when I was growing up.  So, I was exposed to some of it and I remembered liking it.  After buying all of the seasons and watching them, I can say without a doubt that this is one of my favorite 80's tv shows!  I know that it was cancelled due to some health issues causing filming conflicts or something like that, but I think they should bring it back now!  The humor might need a little update (I often times laugh at something because it's my ""mom's"" humor)... but overall this show would be great revived.

I've watched the entire series several times over the past couple of years and I will definitely watch it a lot more!  The acting is great (in my opinion) and obviously being an 80's show there are things that are great to see from ""back then"".  A LOT of fight scenes but not too boring if you don't like fight scenes.  Overall a great show!",1462060800,2,954,4.261111111111111

1543722,4,B00005JOJR,"Washington, DC, suburban housewife is divorced with two kids. Her mom lives with her in Arlington, VA. By accident she runs into an undercover government guy. From then on she keeps getting drawn back into the espionage activities across the Potomac in DC without her family knowing.

I liked this show as a kid and now as an adult. As an adult I, of course, can spot the crazy feminism throughout the series. It warrants nothing more than an eye roll though compared to some TV shows and movies back then. Like that they had the will-they or won't-they build up between the two characters over the run of the show. Definitely get to see how America was back then. Everyone skinny. Good looking. Normal looking/acting. White/black instead of the UN we are today. Love the stay-at-home mom bit. She was a proud mom. But of course she had to do the career thing on the down low to satisfy the femnazis.

I found it funny about 20+ years later this man I knew who was married, had two kids, couldn't hold down a job, but loved that his wife could told me that he would have never have watched such a show like this as Kate Jackson ""dumbed herself down to be a house wife"". I told him that he obviously had never watched the show. He said no. I said I knew because Jackson's character was the one who solved most if not all of the mysteries. He didn't know what to say then. But he pretty much told him himself--why he was such a feminist cheerleader--because he was lazy. Who knew feminism would ultimately make it harder on women--being mom's, wives, employees, and keeping up their lazy husbands. What a joke.",1452470400,,1608,4.465986394557823
1543892,5,B00005JOJR,"I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this quirky '80's mix of humor, international intrigue, and (very!) understated romance.  Amanda (never ""Mandy"") King (Kate Jackson) is a ""typical housewife,"" 33 years old, a mainstay of the PTA, the Little League, and the Scouts, with a college degree (major in English lit, minor in photojournalism--she probably planned on a career as a newspaper reporter), ""a house (in suburban Arlington, VA), a mortgage, two children (Phillip (Paul Stout), 10, and Jamie (Greg Morton), eight), and a mother (the sometimes slightly dithery Dotty West (Beverly Garland), who shares quarters with her daughter and grandsons)""; she's been divorced for a year and is now tentatively dating a weatherman named Dean (whose face we never see).  Lee Stetson (Bruce Boxleitner), who has something of an international reputation under his code name of ""Scarecrow,"" is a service brat and top-rated agent for the otherwise-unspecified ""Agency,"" working out of a front office that proclaims it an independent documentary-film company; emotionally battered by his parents' deaths when he was very young and a strict and unsympathetic uncle who raised him, he's already lost one partner and is determined never to have another.  When he's handed a package of vital information and has to go on the run from the people who want it back, he ends up at the Washington Amtrak station, where he passes it off to Amanda with instructions to give it to ""the man in the red hat.""  Though things don't quite go as planned, Lee's Section Chief, Billy Melrose (Mel Stewart), approves of Amanda's intuitive style and ability to think on her feet and improvise (vital gifts for a mother of young boys), and keeps calling on her for courier work, cover jobs, and eventually clerical tasks that expose her to a lot of confidential information.  Since this is 1983, the KGB and the Eastern Bloc are still major threats to U.S. security, and Amanda and Lee, often thrown willy-nilly into unofficial partnership, find themselves opposing agents of both, along with international gunrunners, defectors, free-lance assassins, and traitors.

Amanda's not conventionally pretty, with her tall boyish figure, shaggy '80's haircuts, and often endearingly squeaky voice, but Jackson brings her to delightful life, showing the conflicts between family and unexpected new career, including the necessity of often lying to her mother about what she's up to--and the unexpected wellsprings of courage and initiative she discovers within herself.  Lee is smooth and tough, if something of a playboy, and his fellow agent, the always-perfectly-coiffed, domestically-helpless, and sometimes snarky Francine Desmond (Martha Smith), adds an underplayed note of humor teamed with, as needed, flinty purpose and competence.  The series also has a very coherent, unified feel to it, probably because, out of the 21 episodes in this season, six were scripted by series creators Eugenie Ross-Leming and Brad Buckner, four by producer Peter Lefcourt, three by Rudolf Borchert, two by Tom Sawyer, and one by executive producer Juanita Bartlett--over three-quarters of the whole.",1451692800,,3146,5.328629032258065

some episodes have twists). Plus, you don't have to follow a season long plot
line. Most episodes are stand alone. Best if watched in sequence, but you can
delay watching them without having to review the prior episode.

These DVDs are excellent video and audio transfers. Video is not perfect, yet they
are good quality standard def. and better than many '80s DVD transfers. Almost
better than SD. Audio is mono of course, though again the quality is great.

I been waiting and checking regularly for this series to come out on DVD for quite awhile; I checked again recently and was elated to find it available. I got it right away and I am so glad I did. This was one of my favorite shows when it was on and for years in reruns afterward.

Too bad there's no bonus features though; it would be great to see archived interviews with the cast, original series promos and/or a show retrospective with the cast today. I just ordered the second season and can't wait to receive it. I will be getting the entire series soon.

One more note: the show really depicts the technology of the time and it was really fun looking back on all the now obsolete technology and remembering how it was so advanced for the time. It makes me smile because I used to work on those computers, too; and now look at us. :)",1430092800,,887,4.236686390532545
1544055,5,B00005JOJR,"When several friends found out I was a fan of Babylon 5, they made the connection between series star Bruce Boxleitner and his 80's series, Scarecrow and Mrs. King.  Curious, I found it in reruns.  I was quickly hooked on this light, charming spy show.  After years of waiting, Warner has finally released the first season to DVD.  And it is as charming as I remembered it being.

Lee ""Scarecrow"" Stetson (Bruce Boxleitner) is one of the top spies for unnamed ""Agency"" located in Washington DC.  One day, when in danger, he gives a package to divorced mother of two Amanda King (Kate Jackson of Charlie's Angels fame).  Impressed by her resourcefulness, Lee's boss Billy Melrose (Mel Stewart) hires Amanda to work for The Agency part time.

It really is amazing the kinds of dangers you can find in suburbia.  Early episodes of the season find Amanda uncovering spies in a cosmetics company and a fast food chain.  As the season continues, the two deal with royalty, a mole, and various Russian plots all while flirting shamelessly.

I've got to admit that I don't buy the romantic chemistry between the two that much this season.  Scarecrow is still too dismissive of Amanda and upset by being saddled with this civilian.  By the end, I am seeing a real friendship develop, however.  When Amanda is in trouble, Lee will do anything to save her.

The show is pure 80's, and I'm not just talking about the costumes (although they are obviously dated as well.)  All the villains are communists, usually of the Russian variety.  The Cold War permeates every aspect of the story.  The villains love to plot in heavily accented English instead of their native language, and cars explode on any impact.

The show has its own charm.  Yes, it is a spy show, but all the plots take place in Washington, DC.  And how Amanda figures things out and how she and Lee get in and out of danger would only happen on TV.  The show does deliver some danger every week, but very little in the way of stunts or realistic violence.  This is the spy show you can watch with your grandmother.

But as I said, the show is charming.  And that comes from the characters.  You can't help but truly like Amanda and her over eagerness to help.  While Lee can be gruff with her, he usually softens by the end of the episode after she's provided some important piece of the puzzle.  Both of the leads play their scenes perfectly.

And a lot of the fun comes from the supporting cast.  Mel Stewart is given the least to do as the serious boss, but he does make Billy memorable.  More fun is had by Martha Smith as Francine Desmond, the agent usually left in the office.  Francine doesn't get why she, the trained operative, is stuck in the office while the amateur is out in the field.  She takes every opportunity she can to get her digs in, and they usually fly right over Amanda's head.

Also in supporting roles are Amanda's family.  Paul Stout and Greg Morton play Amanda's two boys; they may appear in one or two scenes per episode.  Beverly Garland gets more screen time as Amanda's mother, Dotty West, who also lives with them.  Since Amanda can't tell her family about her new job, deflecting her mother's suspicions provides plenty of fun moments.  All three characters do add to the charm, keeping the feel of the series very light.

Despite what I've said about the light feel, the plots do hold together.  The first few episodes have some holes or leaps of logic, but once the season gets rolling, these stories make sense.  They may not be the complex, realistic stories we'd get today, but for a comedic spy show, they are perfect.

The first season consisted of 21 episodes, and we get them on 5 discs.  That's it.  No bonus features at all.  The full screen picture looks good, except for the stock shots of Washington, DC used.  The mono sound won't tax your system, but is easy to understand.

I remembered all over again why I found this series so fun when I first discovered it.  If you have fond memories of the show, start your collection with Scarecrow and Mrs. King Season 1.",1429574400,8,4067,4.544827586206897
1544056,5,B00005JOJR,"My wife and I love this show.  She keeps the DVDs inside our TV/DVD combo in the kitchen 24/7 and watches it all the time when cooking and doing dishes.

It is a through back that doesn't have too much violence and mature themes that you get nowadays on all shows.  Very nostalgic.",1429228800,,281,4.264150943396227
1544057,5,B00005JOJR,"Who doesn't like the 80s. Of course if you grew up watching this show you will love seeing it again as an adult.  Both my daughters have enjoyed watching this two, for the first time.  They are a bit cheesy, but they are cute, funny, and they show a bit of what life was like as a spy without even having a cell phone!!!  We laugh and enjoy these together as a family and don't end each episode feeling dirty or disturbed by graphic violence.  I loved this as a teenage and love them now as well.",1428624000,,496,4.082474226804123

1544167,5,B00005JOJR,"This was one of my favorite shows growing up. I recently started watching it again and was so happy to find it available on DVD and streaming.
I have let my 7 year old daughter watch a few episodes and she's hooked. We haven't let her watch any current primetime shows and this is perfect-it's not too intense/scary and there is very little I'd feel uncomfortable with her seeing. It's nice to have a show we can watch together where we are both happy.
The chemistry of Bruce Boxleitner and Kate Jackson is such that within 3 minutes of seeing them on screen together she asked if they would end up getting married. Now she plays ""spy"" and talks about wanting to meet ""Mrs. King"" to get her autograph.
LOVE season 1!!!! I didn't realize as a kid what a great comedic actress Jackson is. I can easily watch all of these episodes again and again.
And.....gee whiz I wish there were some bonus features. I would pay extra for commentary/interviews, anything. This show has a strong and loyal fan base for a reason.",1417996800,4,1011,4.5

1544246,5,B00005JOJR,"This show was awesome back in the early 80's. Loads of fun and the chemistry between the Scarecrow and Mrs King was well lets just say lots of tension there. Very cute, well written, fun stories, early 80's cheesy cold war drama where it was secret U.S. government agents up against those pesky iron curtain agents with those foreign accents. All the while Amanda King gets mixed up somehow in some way where she gets to work the case with Scarecrow. Lots of secret agent fun, great supporting cast, takes you back to when TV was fun and we weren't plagued with the non-fun mindless junk thats on now. This is classic TV that anyone in the family can enjoy. Old TV beats new TV hands down and Scarecrow and Mrs King does not disappoint!",1404432000,,736,4.45925925925926
1544247,5,B00005JOJR,"Funny detective show!  Kate Jackson is so funny as Mrs. King.  Scarecrow is a little weird because of the way he is played.  I would have liked for him to be either ""Maxwell Smart"" spy or someone who is so James Bondish that it would be funny.",1403308800,,243,4.127659574468085

I actually like this better than my wife. I recommend if you like this type of TV series - Remington Steele is another series we like.  The quality is good enough for a 55"" HD TV.",1388534400,,329,4.140625

1544420,5,B00005JOJR,"I am generally happy with my Prime membership but I have recently found a lot of videos in my watchlist that were previously ""included"" that have now become pay-per-view. This includes really old films from the 1940s, so this can't just be about the studios charging more for these videos. So I was almost through the first season of Scarecrow and Mrs. King when Amazon decided to remove it from Prime and then bring it back as an expensive pay-per-view. $1.99 per single episode for a show that is 30 years old? And these old shows had something like 22-24 episodes per season - you do the math. If I could buy permanent video access to an old show for something reasonable like $10 that would be one thing, but $40+ per season? This is just greed on the part of Amazon and the studios - the content was created decades ago. Now they are just selling something that costs them almost nothing to reproduce and share.

At any rate, this is a great old show. I wish they would make more shows like this today - some action, some villainry, but clean enough that kids can watch (like I watched this when I was a kid). And Bruce Boxleitner is always terrific.",1376265600,2,1155,4.422535211267606

1544424,5,B00005JOJR,"Since I was very young I loved spy stories, (that is why I think I absolutely love James Bond up to this day), so when this show came around I got into it head first and it still remains one of my favorite shows ever. The storyline was clever, the characters very likable and every week they had a different adventure and in the process the got to know each other better and developed a friendship that soon turned into something else, and that chemistry between them is what got me hook episode after episode and after all these years I still enjoy the Scarecrow and Mrs. King's adventures.

For people who never saw this show I absoulutely recommend it, and for those out there who love it just like me, there's never too late to come back and enjoy it again.",1372723200,,761,4.359154929577465

1544525,4,B00005JOJR,I enjoyed watching the first season on Amazon prime and most of the second season. Then suddenly it disappeared from Amazon prime and is only available at $1.99 a show. Does this happen often with Amazon prime? Makes it less enticing to join.,1372464000,,242,4.651162790697675

Highlights the well-known fact that a housewife can do just about anything and still keep her hair straight.  :>)  While the plots and scripts are somewhat lacking, I find it refreshing that the actors aren't falling into bed all the time and blood and gore isn't the major focus of the program.

1544691,4,B00005JOJR,"I remember loving this show as a child. And I wasn't disappointed when I watched it again for the first time in many years. The whole premise of a housewife becoming an assistant ""spy"" is pretty preposterous, but somehow it works here. Kate Jackson is likeable as Spy Mom and Bruce Boxleitner does a good job as the cool, ""loner"" spy. Their chemistry is great and there's lots of action to keep the plot rolling along.

It was a simpler time, when the bad guys were shot they did not explode in a mass of organs and blood. They simply fall to the ground.  The plots are not complicated and the photography and acting are very weak by today's standards.

Even better I can watch it on Amazon Instant video with my Amazon Prime membership.  Just another great perk for being an Amazon Prime member.

Some of the plot concepts might be a bit far-fetched but it was and is a fun program to watch. Comparing the technology then with what we have today is eye-opening - there were no cell phones then and computers were huge - we have come a long way!

If you like light weight spy stuff like the episodes of Murder She Wrote with Michael Haggerty in them (they're some of my favorite episodes) then you'll most likely adore this too. The thing that first grabbed my attention was the fact that they looked like such a cute couple ( I don't say that often, mainly because it sounds so sappy, but it's true), combine that with the plot and you've got a good bet that it's going to be a great show.",1362441600,,516,4.212121212121212

1545234,2,B00005JOJR,"I'm sure it was cute and funny when it first appeared in the early 80's, but by today's standards, the plots are implausible, the acting is immature, the scripts are inane and the action looks less fluid than Gumby.  The premise is good and would hold a lot of interest  -- a divorced mother of two sons, living with her mother, is inadvertently drawn into the world of spies and finds she has a knack for solving problems and getting her erstwhile partner out of jams.  Her partner refuses to acknowledge the partnership, but his superior continues to call on Mrs. King to help him.  I watched five episodes, then realized I wouldn't be watching anymore.  Too silly.

1545385,5,B00005JOJR,"I enjoyed re-visiting this show all these years later.. enough to buy the dvds. I never get tired of the very first episode.

The cases are interesting enough but not too complicated. Amanda gets into just enough trouble to use her skills from being a cub scout mother and a savvy housewife to get herself out of trouble. Lee trails behind her and gets her out of the bigger messes. I think part of the appeal is that Amanda is a 'housewife' with so much potential and just when she needs to break out of the mold, Lee appears. He's so suave and world smart, but reluctantly feels the need to protect Amanda and learns from her more basic lifestyle. This mutual need draws them to each other and they work well together.

I got the biggest kick out of looking back at the show and all of it's 'retro' glory. Pay phones, phrases, huge computers and printers, award winning wardrobe at the time, the guest stars, etc. It's fun to watch with someone else so you can laugh at this stuff together.

Good show with just enough attraction between the leads and just enough cheese factor.",1360454400,,1080,4.472081218274112

1545388,5,B00005JOJR,"I watched this series as a young teenager with my mom and we both really escaped into it. It's actually an interesting experience to see what I loved as a kid and realize the quality was really there. There are very small details in dialog in Season 1 that get unexpectedly added by the characters - perhaps even are ad-libbed by the actors themselves. Very quick rejoinders that you don't expect enhance the dimension of the characters and the humor. The pacing of the romantic tension between the lead characters is excellent in season 1, given the fact that you'd never know whether or not you were going to be renewed when you start shooting. (Nowadays, you don't even know you're renewed after finishing the season...) SC&MRS.K still holds up very well. Costuming has a few small ""whoa is THAT out of fashion"" moments, but otherwise all elements, including the editing look current enough to avoid distraction a generation past it's shelf life. Fun show!",1358812800,,959,4.818181818181818

 again!",1356739200,,88,3.4
1545392,5,B00005JOJR,"Unlike a lot of people who reviewed the show here, I didn't watch it during the `80s, but that was only because I was too young at the time to know it existed.  I discovered it in reruns years later.  Like other reviewers, I enjoy the show because it is much less violent and crude than a lot of newer tv shows, and I think it's a lot more fun, too.  Scarecrow and Mrs. King has a little of everything: action, adventure, comedy, and romance.  Sometimes, it has a bit of mystery, too.

The premise of the show is that ""Scarecrow"", a secret agent working for an organization in the Washington D.C. area known only as the ""Agency"", finds himself in a tough spot one day and is forced to ask a civilian, Mrs. King, for help.  Although he thought that their association would end after she completed a small task for him, she ends up helping him much more than he expected and joins the Agency herself, offering a unique point-of-view on things because she understands more about ordinary civilian life than the regular agents do.  At times, the series might seem a little corny because of the way an elite group of trained secret agents comes to rely on an ordinary suburban housewife, but it's all in fun.  Personally, I find the shows hilarious, with the clashes between Mrs. King's nave yet practical approach to situations and Scarecrow's professional experience, particularly since Mrs. King has to go to great lengths to keep her family from finding out that she has become a spy.  At first, Scarecrow and Mrs. King only work together reluctantly, but they eventually become friends and later fall in love.

Here is a list of the first season episodes:

1. The First Time - Amanda King, divorced mother of two boys, starts off a hectic day by giving her boyfriend a ride to the train station where she is approached by a stranger who tells her that he's a government agent and begs her to deliver a package for him.  This simple task proves much more difficult than it sounds, and Amanda finds herself drawn into the world of espionage with the spy, Lee Stetson, whose codename is Scarecrow.

2. There Goes the Neighborhood - Amanda is out job hunting when Lee unexpectedly shows up and recruits her to pose as his wife while he investigates sinister happenings in an ordinary suburban neighborhood.

3. If Thoughts Could Kill - Lee is injured when another agent suddenly goes crazy and shoots up the Agency's headquarters. He ends up in the hospital where Amanda has been doing volunteer work and becomes a target of the same brainwashing that caused the other agent to go berserk.

4. Magic Bus - The latest in weapons technology is an armored, weaponized vehicle that looks like an ordinary RV.  Lee is assigned to drive it across the country to the testing ground, but it is stolen by members of a survivalist group.

1545558,5,B00005JOJR,"I'd forgotten how delightful this show was when it was a weekly series in the mid '80s. You might have to suspend your belief in some of the ""bad"" guys they try and thwart as you wonder, when the spies are serious, how they did it without laughing as the threats seem a little tame by today's standards.  Some, surprisingly, may have been simply ahead of their time as it seems like something taken from a current headline. There is no gratuitous sex, minimum amounts of violence, with no blood or guts that today's TV shows think I want to see, and subtle humor.  The chemistry Kate Jackson makes with all the co-stars makes it worth watching alone. But, the chemistry between Jackson and co-star Bruce Boxleitner is what makes this show so delightful. I've purchased seasons 1 and 2 and watched 3 and 4 on Amazon Prime. In season 4, the relationship between Scarecrow and Mrs. King becomes serious and marriage occurs; but, unfortunately, Jackson became ill and was in the series very little half-way through and you can see why the series was canceled.  No Jackson, no chemistry on the set, boring show.
  My nine-year old grandson loves this show.  He finds it hard to understand life with no cell phone and no computers.  ""How did they LIVE back then? I mean, how did they do ANYTHING?"" he asks.  It is fun to remember the days of phone booths and very, very basic computers.  It's a ""feel good"" show even though they are tasked with making the Nation safer.
  If you want to harken back to some of the joys of television, when you couldn't wait for each week to bring you a new episode, when sex and violence were footnotes, not the main story, then I recommend ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King.""
  Someone in another post mentioned the sound quality.  It isn't the best. We have to turn our TV up very high.  We have watched with subtitles, which helps.",1325116800,4,1852,4.536144578313253

I used to watch this program as a kid, and the humour is such that kids and adults can understand and enjoy it. No hidden meanings, no sexual double meanings, just the slapstick and laughs of a good clean show! The Russians want their top agent back, so they decide to capture ""the agency's"" top agent to trade. By a wacky series of events, they think Scarecrow is Amanda, not Lee, and they capture her. Of course the US government won't give up their prize rook captured for a small pawn, but Scarecrow (the real one) takes matters in his own hands to get her back. This puts him in trouble with the agency, so he must break up the Russian ring to clear his name. Of course, he does-but with the bad guys still thinking Amanda is the dreaded scarecrow-even giving up when she says she has them beat (which she doesn't)! Haha!

Now I'm able to watch this where and when ever I want.  The clarity was good, tha audio was good. I guess I should now tell what I liked about this show, for those rare people who didn't have the opportunity to watch it back in the day.

What is the chance that a suburban housewife would get the chance (by accident) to work with the government.  Slim and none. So just based on this alone the storyline was great.  It allowed us at home to put oursleves in Amanda's place without actually being in any kind of danger whatsoever.

The Chemistry between kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner made the show even more believable to watch. I can't wait to watch Season 2.",1305849600,7,857,4.2592592592592595
1545631,5,B00005JOJR,"My Mom wanted this for her birthday.  I had never heard of it before but Mom said it was a great show and she was right!  There is just something funny about it when you take a suburban housewife and pair her with one of the Agency's top agents.  I think the funniest part about this show is how Amanda (the housewife) continually manages to not only get Lee (the agent) into trouble but out of it as well.  Of course, he really doesn't need any help getting into trouble but you can be sure something will go wrong the moment you add Amanda into the equation.  I have yet to go through and count all the times she saves his life but I'm sure the number would be high.  Billy (Lee, and eventually Amanda's, supervisor) provides a nice support to the two stars with his sense of humor and enjoyment at pairing Amanda and Lee together for case after case.  Lee used to be a loner after his partner took a bullet in the head for him, but not after Billy met Amanda who is probably the only one who could put up with Lee.  Lee doesn't like the fact he is paired with a civilian, at least in the beginning.  However, just as Amanda manages to grow on the audience, she also manages to grow on Lee and the others with whom she has contact at the Agency.  Lee of course doesn't admit, at least to Amanda, how much he cares for her which adds an interesting twist to the story as he tries to hide his jealousy and affection.  And of course, no one can know that Amanda works for the Agency.  Add in the fact that Amanda has two little boys, is divorced, and her mother lives with her and it makes for a quite an adventure.  As Amanda gets called away on cases, the stories to explain her coming and going get to be more and more hilarious.  Her mother's suspicions of what she is up to also seem to hit the ceiling, the most prominent being that Amanda is having an affair.  All in all, a delightful show perfect for families.  We have already bought season 2 and will probably get seasons 3 and 4 as soon as they come out.",1304467200,2,2015,4.167958656330749

only 26 years old, so this show was just airing the year I was born, but I must have seen
re-runs as a very young child, because even though I have no distinct memories of any one
specific episode, I've always wanted to see the show again, & I've always had a special
fondness for it. When I saw it release on DVD I was thrilled, but a recent loss of job
caused me to hold off on buying it.  This last Christmas, however, my brother bought it
for my Mom, & we watched it together, beginning to end, in less than a week! I've enjoyed
it immensely!  I must have had good taste as a child, because it has instantly become one
of my top 5 favorite shows.  I'm actually starting over on it for the 3rd time now! ;)

The humor is great... sometimes it's silly, sometimes it is ooooh so subtle, & sometimes
the biggest laughs in the whole episode are the baffled looks on the faces of Amanda's
coworkers.  The chemistry between Boxleitner & Jackson is superb... you actually believe
they are 'more than friends' behind the scenes as well - they play off of each other so
well. One of my favorite scenes is from ""Filming Raul""... while waiting in a car for a
signal from headquarters, a moment of feined love-making almost turns into the real thing!
It remains totally innocent of course, but their response afterwards is priceless!! And
the action/suspense in this show just pulls you right in. Who needs blood & gore when you
have this family friendly action? It's got all the good stuff that's worth watching.

Sometimes I want goofy, sometimes I want serious, but this is a perfect blend of the two.
This show is an entirely enjoyable 'experience' that I recommend to anyone. I've really
given up on modern shows.... too much skin, too much innuendo, too much gore, & too much
dirty humor. Thankfully, with a show such as this, I don't miss those moderns shows one
bit. In fact, I would trade out all the modern shows for this one classic gem.

Warner Brothers... Thank you sooo much for releasing the First & Second seasons so far..
but PLEASE don't forget about us & leave us hanging here!  Please bring us the final two
seasons quickly!",1301443200,6,2222,4.402439024390244

The show revolves around the interaction between a surburban housewife and top CIA agent Lee Stetson. You start off feeling slightly embarrassed to be a housewife;-) Amanda redeems herself, however,and saves the day on several occations. The funny situations the two get themselves into are really hilarious, and i cant stop smiling when i think about the two of them.

1545694,5,B00005JOJR,"Looking for some light entertainment, I bought ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" on a whim.  I had pleasant but vague memories of watching it occasionally as a college student when it first aired in the 80s but had not seen it since then.  Now, I'm startled at how much I enjoyed this first season.  The premise is a variation on the fantasy plot about an object or a portal that allows the finder to enter an alternate world.  In this case, via a mysterious package and a train station, Amanda King leaves her safe, warm, but predictable family life to join agent Lee Stetson (""Scarecrow"") in a realm of danger, adventure, and intrigue.  Much of the pleasure of this show is seeing how those two worlds collide and how Amanda and Lee form a partnership that segues into a friendship and (almost) a romance.  The chemistry between the two leads (Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner) sparkles, and the show is often quite funny, especially when Amanda tries furiously to keep her alternate life a secret from her mother and sons.  At the end of many of the episodes, she  returns home safely again, but Lee often shows up unexpectedly to talk with her through a window or in a back garden; interestingly, by the close of the season, he seems a little wistful about not being able to come openly into the ""home"" realm that he knows so little about.

I am 24 years old, these shows are older than I am, but I still love them.  Fortantly the only thing that dates them is the women's fashions.  The men all wear suits which never got out of style.  The plots are sometimes silly but always well done.  In short I recommend this show for anyone who is a fan of spy shows.  A little comedy, a little drama, a little romance, this has something for everyone.",1296518400,,563,4.10091743119266

Many of the older tv shows are so much better than what we see today.  They are more imaginative and better written.  Now most of the dialogue is written to be said over an autopsy.

I think it is appalling that for one it has taken this long to even come out with Season 1, much less have to wait infinity for any of the other seasons... It would be nice if it is taking this long that some of the 80's interview and commercials would be on the next discs for extras as well as current interviews of the remaining cast members (even down to the boys).

I pre-ordered Season 1 as soon as I discovered it was going to be released, and I am signed-up for notifications as soon as Seasons 2-4 are to be released.  This show Features the escapades of a divorced Suburban mother of two young boys who accidentally gets involved in a Government Agency operative, codename Scarecrow.  Season 1 finds Mrs King being asked to assist Scarecrow on various cases, much to his chagrin.  He feels burdened by her seemingly backwardness and practicality, however, she brings something to his line of work that he never expected - logic and sensitivity.  Bruce Boxleitner portrays the suave and daring Scarecrow. Kate Jackson is the typical suburban housewife-turned-spy.  If possible, I would give this program 10 stars.

What a joy it has been to discover that this brilliantly written series is timeless ... the humor and romance is just as fresh now as it was 25 years ago.  I watch the episodes again and again and never get tired of the satire and great laugh-out-loud moments, as well as the awesome chemistry between Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner.  And with all the ""permissiveness"" in today's programming, it is refreshing to watch a show with high moral standards.  In addition to being great entertainment, Scarecrow and Mrs. King is a wonderful trip down Memory Lane, 80's style!

1545974,5,B00005JOJR,"I had never seen 'Scarecrow and Mrs King' in its original run in the 1980s. I was too big a fan of Remington Steele to watch anything else! After watching all the seasons of R.S. countless times, I needed to give it a break. I looked to Amazon for suggestions and got 'Scarecrow and Mrs King'. I love it! It's better than the constantly bickering couple in Moonlighting and it's got smarter storylines of spy, treason and espionage so typical of the Cold War era. It's funny now to hear of defection from Hungary, hearing a man being referred to as 'cute' and seeing someone rooted to the spot calling from a phone booth but it's all a good reminder of how our world has changed in 25 years. Bruce Boxleitner is certainly eye candy (even today) and Kate Jackson has good chemistry with him. I would have liked to see the Mrs. King character as a little less housewifey/ditzy though -- her character would never fly in the 00s. Beverly Garland was the quintessential nagging mother. Overall, 'Scarecrow and Mrs King' is a great series and I'm definitely looking forward to the release of the other seasons; for now, I guess I'll have to watch the other seasons online.",1284681600,,1167,4.561904761904762

Chemistry like theirs is very rare, and the show's talented writers made the most of it.  I couldn't be happier that Season 1 is FINALLY out (25+ years is a long time to wait).

Although nearly every episode of season 1 deals with the bad guys being Russian or at least Communist, the story lines are ""spy"" enough to keep your attention.

1546103,5,B00005JOJR,"After waiting years for Scarecrow and Mrs. King to be released on DVD, I was thrilled to finally purchase Season One. It was delightful to view each uncut episode in crisp color and enjoy clear sound. I do wish there had been some extra features, like interviews with the stars. However, with or without the extras, the Season I DVDs didn't disappoint.

The show is well written, the acting is top-notch, and the chemistry between Lee and Amanda jumps off the screen. Kate Jackson, Bruce Boxleitner, Mel Stewart, Martha Smith, Beverly Garland, Paul Stout and Greg Morton are a wonderful essemble cast. The show's unique take on a house-wife-turned spy is light-hearted fun for the whole family. While most episodes dealt with espionage during the Soviet Union Era of the Cold War, other episodes dealt with a wide array of threats to the U.S., like terrorism, drug cartels, mob bosses, environmental threats, etc.

I can only hope Seasons two, three and four will also be released. Each year, the series got better and better. Four or five episodes of Season II were filmed in Europe and they are ""must-see.""

Season III saw the most growth in the main characters and their relationship. Also, the episodes became more dramatic without losing their charm. Season IV had some of the most riveting episodes and was highly satisfying for the fans.

The series was enjoyed by my whole family. I watched it with my young children in the 1980s, my husband and I watched it in reruns in the 1990s, and our children again became fans while in college. We'd all like to see it again, uncut and commerical free. I hope the next generation of grandchildren get to see it, too.",1276732800,5,1665,4.750865051903114

'Nuff said.

I loved this show when it was first shown and watched faithfully until its premature end.  As has been said before, television that you didn't mind sharing with your children or your mother and all could enjoy.  Much as I love a number of current shows, the double entrendres and outright sexuality in them is sometimes too much.

And she was right, it is really similar (though not enough to make Chuck a remake of this show).  And now this show is at the top of my list of favorites.  Check it out!  You won't be disappointed!

I love the way the series has played out, the way the characters interact with each other, and the growing romance between the two main characters.

I always thought she was funny on ""Charlie's Angels"" and so I decided to give ""Scarecrow"" a try.

This show is great! It brought back a lot of memories especially after I heard the opening theme song.

Kate Jackson is wonderful as ""Amanda King,"" the suburban divorced mother of two, whose mother is living with her when she gets ""drafted"" into becoming a government operative. Jackson has great comedic timing and even though she plays a bumbling housewife, she comes up with some out-of-the-box thinking to help ""Scarecrow"" crack the case. Bruce Boxleitner is dashing as the suave ""007"" type of government agent, Lee ""Scarecrow"" Stetson, who ropes Amanda into working for the US Government as a ""civilian"" agent-- even though at first he can't stand working with her! Eventually they start developing a friendship and each episode borders on a little romance that might spark up between them at any moment.

That romantic tension is the glue that keeps the show from becoming stale and there's mystery, crime, and action in each episode.

The supporting cast includes Beverly Garland ""Dotty West"" Amanda's mother, Mel Stewart ""Billy Melrose"" the government agency boss, and Martha Smith ""Francine Desmond"" another agent, as well as two talented young boys, Greg Morton and Paul Stout, who play Amanda's kids.

Picture quality is decent and the clamshell case holds all five DVDs. It also comes with a foldout insert that lists episode name, air date, and brief description.

Unfortunately there aren't any special features. I hope they release the second season soon!",1273190400,,2019,5.493548387096774
1546206,5,B00005JOJR,"Mrs King makes an appealing spy with a tantalizing relationship with Scarecrow. Neither can admit their feeling for each other, but show obvious concern for the other when in trouble. Mrs King (Amanda) knows nothing about the world of spys, yet shows excellent instincts that often gets both of them out of trouble. Scarecrows assumption that he knows whats best often provides the comedy as Amanda finds a way out of trouble. The show is predictable yet enjoyable. Its fiction with believable conflicts between the various characters.",1272758400,,535,5.160919540229885

  That's the ""shtick"" of the story . Yes , it is cornball from the 80's time period and fun for whole family to watch . No cell phones , old cars , AND styles that are coming full circle . Kate does the babbling airhead well and is change from her Charlie's Angel's ""braniac"" part . Probably Bruce Boxleitner's best overall part .

The interaction and chemistry between Lee and Amanda is wonderful! I just love the way that Amanada doesn't let Lee get away with anything. She's his dose of reality. I fervently hope that the rest of the seasons of ""Scarecrow and Mrs King"" can be released on DVD in the very near future. It can't come soon enough for me!!!

1546260,5,B00005JOJR,Loved it!  You won't be disappointed if you are an original fan of the show or a fan of this type of romantic comedy/action/suspense series.  Boxleitner and Jackson have undeniable chemistry!  It reminded me a bit of the TV series CHUCK and the whole Chuck/Sarah dynamic.  They took the same kind of comedic approach to the whole spy genre and added quirky humor combined with sexual chemistry between the two stars.  Except I like Scarecrow and Mrs. King better!  Enjoy.  And let's demand that the WB release the remaining three seasons ASAP!,1271203200,,543,4.836956521739131

1546334,5,B00005JOJR,"Finally, fans can view this great show on DVD. The package comes complete with episode synopses--a nice product for old and new fans alike. As for the show itself, it's an entertaining alternative to some of the less than family friendly options out there today. The plot lines are a bit simplistic, the bad guys are from the Cold War, and some of the outcomes are rather predictable. Still, the characters are nicely developed throughout the season, and the show does not have much violence or suggestive dialogue. Family values are promoted, and positive character traits are encouraged. It is a ""spy"" show, so there are the usual bad guys, and some fist fights or shootouts to go along with the whole thing. Also some tense moments when lives are in jeopardy, but since this show was filmed in the 1980s, most viewers would consider it rather tame. Overall, the show is sure to garner new fans with this release.",1270944000,,915,4.725
1546335,5,B00005JOJR,"We're thrilled to have the first season of this wonderful show on DVD at long last! We were especially happy as we watched the show and saw that it really hasn't ""dated""- besides the fact that the cold war is over, the themes remain the same: spies, government secrets, codes, international intrigue, etc. You'd never watch it and think ""cheesy!"", either. The humor, wit, and acting in the show is better and more natural than any modern comedy/romance on TV or in the movies, in our opinion- but this show has the added bonus of being completely watchable by any member of the family, which is something that is rare today. We could go on forever about the wonderful leads, but in this show the whole supporting cast is also excellent and the ""character actors"" that play the baddies in many episodes are always fun to watch.

The packaging for the DVDs is excellent as well, not flimsy at all! Also, no annoying double-sided disks here! The show itself is crystal clear and the sound is great, and it's really nice to have the complete episodes (every now and then there's a sentence or two that you never saw in the syndication version).

5/5 stars for the show, quality video/audio and packaging!

Bring on Seasons 2-4, please!! It just gets better from here!",1270857600,3,1263,4.654708520179372

The quality of the DVD series is great and the show is just as entertaining as I remember it . . . although I don't remember laughing quite so hard at the fashion and hair style choices back then!

When this 1st season finally came out on DVD, I immediately pre-ordered it.  I was a little worried, though, that my childhood memories wouldn't hold up- there are several shows that I thought were awesome as a 13 year old, that now seem trite and outdated.  Not so with Scarecrow and Mrs. King!  The shows may deal with a political world that no longer exists, but who cares?  The chemistry is obvious and the acting is wonderful.

There is nothing on television today or in the last decade that can compare to the great writing, wit and acting.  There is a great chemistry between Bruce and Kate that can be seen as early as the first couple episodes and continues through all 4 seasons.

I was expecting the picture quality to be very poor. After all it is a 27 year old TV series, but the video quality is quite exceptional for standard DVD (been spoilt lately with blu ray). Watched Episode 3 upscaled to 1080p using my 92 inch projector, and it still held up! Nice colour saturation and plenty of detail exposing all those awful 80's fashions, make-up and hairstyles! The Dolby Digital MONO soundtrack is very lame, but does the job of providing good clear dialogue.
The chemistry between Lee and Amanda is the corner-stone of the show. Very nice. Hope that season 2 follows.
Edit: for those of you in Australia, the discs are Region Free!",1269388800,2,811,4.6
1546416,5,B00005JOJR,"Absolutely fantastic and long overdue!

I remember watching every single episode of Scarecrow and Mrs. King when it was on the air.  The chemistry between Lee and Amanda and watching it develop drew me in every week.  It's so great to finally be able to watch all the Season 1 episodes again - without commercials!  What's even greater is that I can watch them whenever I want.

The pairing of Bruce Boxleitner and Kate Jackson was absolutely perfect.  They played off each other so well.  I don't think any pairing, other than Bruce and Kate, would have made this show as enjoyable and fun to watch.

OK... Not sure about anyone else but... I'm ready for Season 2 and more!

The only improvement I can think of for the rest of the Seasons releases would be the addition of a ""Scenes"" menu so you can pickup where you leave off when you have to stop during an episode.

Would be nice if they include some bonus features (e.g. out takes, interviews, etc.).

Even if the format is the same on future releases.... I'd still be an extremely happy camper!",1269388800,4,1050,4.502645502645502

The only thing that would have made the set better would have been some extras - other than episode selection and languages. Bruce Boxleitner, Kate Jackson, Greg Morton, Paul Stout and Martha Smith are still alive and well, so it would have been great to have some commentary from them.

1546499,5,B00005JOJR,"The life of Amanda King (Kate Jackson), a divorced mother with two young sons, is turned upside down and inside out when super-sexy spy Lee (Codename: ""Scarecrow"") Stetson (Bruce Boxleitner) gives her a package and asks her to get on a train and give it to ""the  man in the red hat."" After their first ""accidental assignment"" is completed, Lee's  boss Billy Melrose (Mel Stuart) thinks that  resourseful Amanda would be a valuable asset to the ""agency."" After all, who would suspect a surburban mother, with a station wagon and a mortgage,  of being a spy? Amanda quickly becomes a ""spy in training."" Lee reluctantly takes her on as his partner; which doesn't please fellow female spy Francine (Martha Smith) at all. Trouble is, Amanda must keep her new job a secret from her sons (Paul Stout and Greg Morton) and her meddlesome but oblivious mother Dotty (Beverly Garland). Amanda comes up with some outlandish excuses for her long absences as, each episode, she and Lee go off on secret missions full of excitement, intrigue, a little danger, and a lot of comedy. While working undercover, Amanda says, ""I feel like I'm lying and cheating."" Lee replies, ""You are lying and cheating. You work for the United States government.""
  The superb music that plays during the opening credits of each episode perfectly illustrates the series' deft mix of action, adventure, and comedy. But it is the incredible chemistry between Bruce Boxleitner and Kate Jackson that made ""Scarecrow And Mrs. King"" a popular success for CBS from 1983-1987. Kate Jackson deservedly received Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations for her engaging performance as Amanda. I think Bruce Boxleitner  also deserved an Emmy Award nomination  for his performance as Lee, everyone's ideal  rugged, sexy spy. Beverly Garland is a delight in her supporting role as Amanda's mother Dotty, who never notices that numerous kidnapping and asassination attempts are taking place across the street and sometimes practically in her own backyard.
  All 21 episodes from Season 1 (1983) are included in an attractive, easy to use box set. The series is mostly lighthearted, escapist fun. The episode ""If Thoughts Could Kill,"" in which Lee is brainwashed to kill Billy, is about as intense and scary as the show gets. I hope that Warner Brothers will quickly release Seasons 2-4. ""Scarecrow And Mrs. King"" is more than entertaining and fun. It is absolutely addictive!",1269216000,4,2425,5.0375

1546506,5,B00005JOJR,"So after many years of asking, praying, begging, pleading, fans have FINALLY been treated to the first season of everyone's favorite spy and spy/housewife from the '80s. I watched the show in syndication years ago, and when I heard that Warner Bros. had finally agreed to produce the series for DVD, you could have knocked me over with a feather. It was released at the perfect time too, as my mother's birthday was approaching and she'd loved the series as much as I had, and she saw the original run.

So here we are, a week after the first season's arrival, and the giddiness still has yet to completely fade. Oh, many of the storylines are as cheesy as ever, and it's hilarious at how often Scarecrow or Amanda have to run to find a pay-phone to check in with Billy at the Agency (it was a dangerous time, that era before cell phones), but the chemistry between Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner still speaks in a genuine tone that appeals to any generation.

Aside from a few subtitle options, there aren't any extra goodies to peruse, but in this case, they're hardly necessary. Fans of this adorable dramedy should jump at the chance to own this old classic.

1546597,5,B00005JOJR,"I have watched nearly the entire season in the last few days and have been loving it!  I had nearly forgotten how much I used to love this show as a teenager, but then I saw this DVD set advertised in an email from Amazon and knew I had to buy it.  I wasn't sure that the show would hold up today, after all it has been so long, times are so different now and I am all grown up.  But it does hold up pretty well, even given the huge political shift since then.  The show might seem like sort of a white-bread presentation of the world of counter-intelligence, and that may be true in some ways, but the writing and performances are surprisingly good.  I thought it might seem sort of ""Leave It to Beaver"" to me now, but it doesn't really--although not overly violent, people do actually die; there is some fairly spicy dialogue, and the development of the characters is good.  Of course, the chemistry between the lead actors Bruce Boxleitner and Kate Jackson, and hence their characters Lee and Amanda, makes the entire show.

It would have been great to have some special features on the DVDs too, but I was so happy just to see the show again, and in rather good quality video and sound, after all these years that I went ahead and gave it five stars.  I can't wait for seasons 2, 3 & 4 now!  And I would love to see a reunion movie too, to get a glimpse of what would have happened to Lee & Amanda over the years.",1269043200,,1417,4.199261992619927
1546598,5,B00005JOJR,"Okay, so that was six words instead plus and exclamation point. Anyhoo--I was ten years old when this show first came on and I kid (no pun intended) you not, I remember each and every episode like it was yesterday. For two days my couch was my best friend. I made a marathon weekend of it. Every episode made me feel like it was 1983 again. From the opening theme song (I can hear it playing now) to the closing credits, each disc brought back fond memories. So here's another five words--When's season two coming out?",1268956800,,518,4.40625

The COMPLETE episodes - without cutting for length (as syndicating does); or censoring Scarecrow's occasional d___mn (he was kind of a cowboy after all); or editing a modern day perceived political correctness issue (like they did in the Commish release)!  This show was great and even today, I still am amused by some of the schticks.  PLEASE release the next episodes as soon as possible as I've already finished this set in less than a week and I need some more Scarecrow fixes!  Again - thank you - thank you - thank you!!!!",1268870400,,638,4.56140350877193

1546602,5,B00005JOJR,I have been waiting for years for Scarecrow & Mrs King to come out on DVD.  This set did not disappoint.  This series was obviously remastered because I did not realize how poor the original video quality was until I compared the two.  This is a series for anyone who likes light-hearted action as it depicts a suburban housewife who is pulled into the world of spies and somehow manages to stumble around and still save the day.  Add to that the gorgeous Bruce Boxleitner as a superspy and you have a can't-lose combo!  Highly recommended!,1268697600,,540,4.583333333333333
1546603,5,B00005JOJR,I bought it the first morning it came out last week and have almost finished watching the entire first season. It's great clean entertainment that my children and I like to watch together. the Chemistry between Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner is amazing from the moment they meet at the rail station. We've also enjoyed the great storyline in each episode. I beg all to go out and purchase this DVD so Warner Bro's will continue to release this fantastic series.,1268611200,,464,4.7407407407407405

Has everything from adventure to romance.  Please release seasons 2-4.  Will buy as soon as they become available.,1268524800,,267,4.931818181818182
1546605,5,B00005JOJR,"I was very pleased to see an official release of Season 1 of Scarecrow and Mrs King. Great packaging, nice photos and clear as crystal episodes of this great 80's classic TV show. I was sad to see no extras included, but that is Ok-maybe next time. Here's hoping Seasons 2-4 are released soon.
All fans these clear episodes are well worth purchasing.",1268438400,2,350,4.571428571428571
1546675,5,B00005JOJR,"It didn't seem that long ago, since this show has been in syndication for years, but it's been close to 30 years ago, and I still love Scarecrow and Mrs. King.

I know many people who resorted to bootlegs over the years, or the few VHS tapes, but the quality is always questionable that way, and often you're just getting someone capturing the syndicated broadcast, most of which were cut in places, or edited. I never could figure that out - this show was fairly tame, even by the standards of it's day, and certainly in comparison to current shows - yet it still got edited for non-primetime re-runs. This version doesn't appear to be remastered or restored too much - there are some bad dubbing or recorded spots that were in the original broadcast as far as I can remember.

The show is a little campy at times, and you suspend disbelief many times, but it's still a lighthearted and fun poke in the eye of the very serious business of national security.  To sum it up quickly, a divorced Virginia woman ""with two kids, a mother and a mortgage"" becomes the reluctant accomplice of a spy in the fast lane of Washington DC espionage. When the plan falls apart, Amanda King (Kate Jackson) thinks on her feet, applies everyday logic, and helps save the day.

Then to the surprise of the spy, codenamed 'Scarecrow', she seems to enjoy the work and seeks out more, and Lee Stetson (Bruce Boxleitner) becomes the reluctant one - this is no business for suburban moms, certainly not kind-hearted ones who cant shoot, can't hit, and is only guaranteed to confuse the enemy to death. It seems he can't avoid her now, and you get the feeling that their boss, Billy Melrose (Mel Stewart), enjoys throwing them together to get Lee to gear down out of the fast lane a little.

The first season (this item) is a steady mix of a budding friendship/attraction and 'would you please get out of my life?!' on both sides as they intrude on each others comfort zones.

All the while, Amanda keeps her employment in espionage out of view of her family, though expect frequent and funny results when the two worlds Amanda is living in have near misses and collisions on a semi-regular basis. Lee only has one world, and it never included many truly close ties to any one or any thing, and he is caught between irritation/resentment with Amanda who only operates that way and apparent enjoyment at knowing someone who (unlike most people he meets on a daily basis) doesn't function on deception and casual lies.

There is also Francine Desmond (Martha Smith), a character and performance I appreciate more now than I did as a kid, also new to field work, but has been working towards it for all of her career. She is clearly irked that Amanda went from Den Mother to field operations literally overnight, while she has taken the long road training to be an agent. Her thinly veiled jabs at Amanda make you love to hate her, and the rare return volley by Amanda always make the two characters interesting together.

It's a lighthearted romantic show that I love as much now as I did as a child of the 80's. I've avoided watching a current show, Chuck, because the similarities would only make me wish I could get all of Scarecrow and Mrs King on DVD.

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Cough up the rest of it, Warner Brothers!",1268438400,4,3293,4.558375634517766

1546677,5,B00005JOJR,She cannot believe it finally got on DVD.  She has waited for years.  She watches Chuck because it reminds her of the good old days with Lee and Amanda.  Here is hoping the rest of the series is released on DVD.,1268179200,,211,4.097560975609756

Eagerly awaiting for it to arrive.  Now I can finally retire my poor old VHS tapes from the Family Channel and Pax days of SMK.  I will absolutely be ordering the next seasons when they come out - no question on that.
I'm not a big fan of buying entire dvd collections of tv series - until now.  This will be the 1st one for me and I can't think of a better show than this.
Once it arrives, will probably post another good review for it - don't think there's anyway a bad one could happen unless we get a bad DVD copy.

1546749,5,B00005JOJR,"Thank you to the person or persons responsible for releasing ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" on DVD. This is one of my all-time favorite shows. The blend of action, mystery and romance is a winning combination. Each character creates a depth to the show that is seldom seen; especially in one-hour dramas. Lee Stetson proves himself to be someone who can be both gentle as well as fight hard for what he believes in. That sometimes leads him to the brink of insubordination. The plots are generally believable and often fun. There is also a fair amount of humor.

One of my favorite aspects of ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" is the relationship between Lee and Amanda. Kate Jackson makes her character come alive. One of my favorite lines by her came when she and Lee were working with a Russian to defuse a nuclear device, ""I think you should pull the blue wire."" Later Lee asked how she knew it was the blue wire and she said something like, ""It's always the blue wire. When the washing machine has a problem I just jiggle the blue wire."" Great show and one you will enjoy for many years to come.

I'm placing my order NOW and will order each one as they are released. The price is reasonable and I believe that will make a big difference in the success of this release.",1262822400,6,1261,4.454545454545454

The way I see it is that the show was not broadcast in High Definition so I can live with watching it blurry on a standard definition DVD disc. Sure the definition will be fuzzy but I feel that will only add to the nostalgia value.
The show follows the adventures of a Washington, D.C. based home-maker who is thrust into the world of espionage. Its a fun piece of hokum and well worth your time and money.
I have been waiting for this show which, along with ""The Fall Guy"" is a beloved part of my childhood memories, for a long time and will be purchasing this set, even if it is only in low definition.",1261872000,2,801,4.10828025477707

1546925,5,B00005JOJR,"If you wanted a little bit of everything wrapped up in spectacular writing, directing, and acting this was definitely the show to watch. I remember this as one of the few shows I could watch with my parents and all of us enjoy it. There was action for the guys, romance for the ladies, and mystery and comedy for all. I was and still am hard-pressed to pick my favorite character from the two leads, Great performances for both make that a decision I may never be able to make. Add in the great supporting cast and I'm surprised the show isn't still being produced today. Of course, it would have been impossible to keep the story going that long and keep it believable.

Truly one of the unsung heroes of television. The scenery, the locations, the stories it all came together to give us a very memorable experience. Honestly, who can forget the great acting of Bruce Boxleitner, Kate Jackson, Beverly Garland, and Mel Stewart. Personally, I enjoyed this show more than Simon & Simon and MacGyver (And I've always loved MacGyver).

This is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite television shows. It had action, romance, mystery, and comedy. What else could one ask for? Sadly it should have been released to DVD a decade ago and we are still waiting. Please, Release the DVD's soon with great special features like interviews with the cast and crew and behind-the-scene footage. Oh, and make sure to include Bloopers.

This show was VERY entertaining, VERY exciting and VERY romantic.  This is among the very few shows that kept a would-be relationship hanging for a long time without upsetting, frustrating or boring me.

Bruce Boxleitner is his usual suave self as the Scarecrow.  He makes a great spy and a very magnetic love-interest.  It's really very heart-warming when we, the audience, see how he is falling for Amanda King.

Mrs. King (two boys, divorced), who desperately needs a flexible part-time job in the pilot, is also charming, but in her very disarming and gentle way.  She is fun, funny, smart and humble, and wins the heart of nearly everyone she meets.  (This excludes, of course, the few people who have their ego, ambition or plans dented by Mrs. King's presence.)  Kate Jackson has never been better, and she's always good!

The chemistry, as others have mentioned, is amazing.

Factory for quite a little while before getting the first two seasons released and able to buy through amazom.com. I look for something on amazon.com and if it's not there, but at other little stores, you can pretty much bet they're no good.

SMK was very popular in the 80s, and has a large following of fans - it is on the top 10 list of television series with online petitions for DVDs as well as a TV movie sequel.

Think about it before making the purchase - it is frustrating to have poor visuals, the last couple of minutes lopped off the end on many episodes, etc...

Amanda's anxiousness to help, but her inability to perform with proficiency of the a skilled spy allows her clumsiness to bring in our oh so attractive lead spy Lee.  Bruce Boxleitner's return to network television portrays the sexy Lee Stetson who finds a the most unlikely partner in work and in love.

I purchased the set advertised on dvd globe and they are very poor quality. The picture is blurry on some episode, while the sound is distorted in others. Aside from that, they are not the unedited versions that they advertise on the dvd globe site. They are from the syndicated reruns that aired on the now-defunct Family Channel. For those of you who are die-hard fans like myself, you know what I mean. For those of you who don't, FAM edited these eps for language and violence and sometimes just to shorten the episodes to include more commercial time. I don't know anything about the quality on the other sites advertised, but I would reccomend staying away from this one even though they offer the cheapest price. I love this show and couldn't wait until Shoot The Moon decided to realease them, much to my disappointment.

SMK is such a pop culture icon, Kate Jackson even provided her voice as Amanda King on an episode of ""The Family Guy"".

If other 80's TV shows like Punky Brewster, Remington Steele, The Golden Girls, ALF, and Mork and Mindy have been released on DVD, why not SMK?

I have come back to this ""product"" three or four times now in the past couple of years, and I have the same reaction as everyone else whose ""reviews"" (or cries for justice) I have read. WHY NOT S&MK? Not every television series ever created has been released so far, with only S&MK left lonely and avoided, but I do not believe that any OTHER show not in DVD release has gotten such a large number of fan requests.

An average person who was swept up into the world of national intrigue. Mrs. King could have been anyone of us and with Bruce Boxleitner in the picture could only be a bonus. So many television shows have appeared on DVD now, including several that should have been forgotten but this series had a huge following, not just for the hunky spy but because it was an all around, family friendly, show which kept America entertained.

1547405,5,B00005JOJR,"Let's face it guys, the reason this series is likely not being produced is that its probably bogged down in film rights or some other such nonsense.  Someone made the comment about all the stupid shows being released on DVD and why not this one, but that's just the point.  The ones that weren't popular are going to be a lot cheaper to buy the rights and reproduce.  Here's a series that was great from beginning to end: with humor, action, and a even a good romance thrown in; and we're probably waiting for nothing as the studio will never bother re-releasing it.  So, all the die-hard fans will end up buying unauthorized copies and the studio will continue its efforts to stem illegal pirating, which is ironic when most people would prefer to pay for a well-made copy in the first place.  I'm afraid it's hopeless. =(",1198022400,3,823,4.533783783783784

Warner Brothers is missing a huge opportunity. The way I see it, ""the OC"" and many shows of its ""ilk"" are being released first season. Those shows are adored by (mostly?) teens and young adults.
Hellooooo? Warner Brothers? Scarecrow and Mrs King's fan base grew up watching THIS show (and don't get me started on the merits of Scarecrow and Mrs King over ""The OC!!!"") Therefore, the fan base are women (primarily?) in their 30's and 40's... and up... with... (signal cash register cashing out sound) ... EXPENDABLE INCOMES.
This was a wonderful show with talented ACTORS (rare these days) great STORIES (not just a wink and a tumble, to quote one of my favorite characters from another series,) and true chemistry between the leads.

I even tried ordering from one of those iffy Canadian sites (be careful) they still haven't mailed me my disks.

Edit : 3/22/10  - I was so happy when this finally came out on DVD.  I'd been spying on TV Shows on DVD dot com for ages, waiting for some news.  I'm already on the second disc and it's just as hilarious and awesomely 80s as I remember.  The picture quality is great.  I'm trying to drag it out, rather than watching it all in one sitting, since I don't even see a listing for season 2, yet...sigh.  I'm not too worried, since this is WB and not Disney (who has a terrible habit of dropping a show in the middle of putting it out on DVD), but I am crossing my fingers that they release the whole thing.

1547473,5,B00005JOJR,"You know, I read all of the 94 previous reviews about ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King,"" and it really is a confounding mystery as to why this series is not out on DVD.  I remember that the time right around my 16th birthday was when Lee and Amanda finally shared their first kiss.  It was definitely the main topic of conversation when one of my friends and I had the post-show phone conversation we always had every Monday night following SM&K.  This show was a special offering because it really did celebrate, in the best sense, the style and substance of the great movie pairings (William Powell/Mryna Loy; Cary Grant/Rosalind Russell; Cary Grant or Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn; Rock Hudson or James Garner and Doris Day).  Bruce Boxleitner and Kate Jackson (herself almost an iron-clad guarantee of top ratings for years, and who is a vastly underrated talent) shared that unique quality of charming comedic and romantic banter that such aforementioned movie greats also had.  I have read that Kate is a big Katharine Hepburn fan, and I think her respect for and mastery of the slightly screwball, classic genre definitely shows.  She is one those women that the guys found appealing while the women enjoyed her adventures vicariously.  And as for Boxleitner, I am still in awe of his presence. Man, what a gorgeous specimen!  Besides his obvious sex appeal, I just don't see reliable, manly, trustworthy male lead characters like his in current TV offerings. It's really kind of a letdown.  All of this to say, S&MK truly deserves to be released for the public to enjoy in DVD format.  It is a body of work that is proof that quality entertainment--appropriate for everyone in the family--never really goes out of style.  I hope the production companies concerned with this series will do whatever is necessary to present the viewing public with a boxed set featuring outtakes and some other ""behind-the-scenes"" material.

This was a great program that had a little of everything in it.  I also thought it was one of Kate Jackson's best roles.  She and Bruce Boxleitner had such chemistry. The only problem I had with the program was that it ended so abrubtly.  I would have liked to have had at least one more season, but I know that was during the time Kate had BC.  Anyway, I say its time to get a move on and get it on DVD.  You won't make any money until you do. I guarantee you will find that it is a goldmine once it is released.

  Amazon is providing a great service with the notification feature. (It is how I learned about the DVD release of ""The Man from Snowy River"", for example.) I do appreciate it.

All I can say is there was nothing better than the chemistry between Amanda King and Lee Stetson - Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner were terrific in their roles and made me want to watch them when the show originally aired, despite how I was all of 8 years old (seriously, I remember being a kid and staying up to watch this, and despite how I probably didn't understand half the content when it originally aired that is how much I appreciated the show even back then).

I would scoop this up in a second if it came up, and I know a lot of other people would too.  So please, please, please release this show...

Okay, if being a pop culture icon is what it takes to get a DVD (which i can't imagine with all the garbage being released) then Scarecrow and Mrs. King certainly hits that mark. If nothing else, this show has been mentioned 2ce on Family Guy. You'd think that would count for something. I mean, no matter how you feel about Family Guy, being referenced not once but twice in two separate episodes means the show has some kind of status. It's also been on Jeopardy and I found a question in my friends Trivial Pursuit game...

I would pay whatever the studio asked to get these. My tapes are going downhill fast. Homemade dvds are awesome to have, but they don't always play on my DVD player.

1547828,5,B00005JOJR,"Considering the sheer number of television show DVDs released every year, I find it baffling why a show as enjoyable (it was my favorite show of the era) to watch as 'Scarecrow and Mrs. King' has not been among them. From the very first show in which Mrs. King (Kate Jackson) is inadvertently sucked into a world of handsome spies [believe me, Boxleitner would make any woman want to 'look for the man in the red hat'], international intrigue, and catty co-workers -- 'Scarecrow' takes us on a fun, exciting, and witty fantasy ride. The chemistry between Boxleitner (Scarecrow) and Jackson's characters is instantaneous but of course, neither is willing to acknowledge it to the other. Thus, we have the setup for several years' worth of good, exciting, and relatively wholesome entertainment. Along the way, the housewife's natural instincts for the world of espionage are polished and she earns the respect of her co-workers at the 'Agency'. But during those first four years, there are enough laughs, thrills, intrigue and romance to keep fans coming back for more. What more can I say? Oh yes.

Like others, I was a little bit worried that I wouldn't like the show as much as I remembered or that the first season might not be that great (seasons 2 and 3 are the ones I remember as favorites). But I was pleasantly surprised. This show is just as funny and cheesily entertaining as ever. The clothes, hairstyles, and ""technology"" of the 80s lend some extra laughs all these years later. The chemistry between the stars is great right from the start. And I'm not disappointed by the lack of commentary and interviews, since I've found with other shows that the stars can sometimes ruin the shows for me with their comments. Now the only question is, when does the next one come out??

My original review:

Like many of the other reviewers, I'm wondering when this show will finally come out on DVD. I have a bunch of mishmash VCR tapes from when SMK was on the Family Channel, but they're getting old, no one is showing the series right now, and I'd LOVE to own all 4 seasons on DVD.

PLEASE, someone, release this show of cornball, America-before-globalization, pre-end of Cold War, goofy, goodness! This show truly came just before the end of an era, one I remember fondly, when you could still believe in Americans working for the government as good guys. Okay, that's probably enough, but yeah, bring on the 80s.

1547832,5,B00005JOJR,"I see I am not the only one out there that wants to see this series again.

Thank God for that.

I grew up watching this series. My mom liked it and she and I would watch every episode when it originally aired, particularly the one where Lee and Amanda finally got married. I don't have a DVR or enough time in the day to hunt and search for the episodes, which many times air out of order. Can we get this on DVD?

Here is a really, super smart idea.

Anyone ready for this one?

Take pre-orders. Release the ENTIRE SHOW on DVD, then send it out to those who have pre-ordered it. That makes a lot of sense. Why am I seeing some new series, which haven't been on but even 1-2 seasons, before they are out on DVD.

Sopranos? NIP/TUCK? These series are still being aired with new episodes weekly. I know they are popular, but come on, this show was good too.

How hard can this be? There are a lot of people that like the series, and want to see it again. There was a time I had to wait 2 years in between the time it was on one station in syndication before it came back on another station.

AS OF 3/9/2010....

This series has been released on DVD. The earlier review was written 3 years ago. I had actually forgot I had written a review of this until I went to review it and it gave me the option to EDIT, and EDIT I shall.

I still give it 5 stars. The network and production company did great by it, or as best as they could; given it's age. It has been over 20 years since it has been on and I bet the original tape/film is not as good as it once was, but it isn't as bad as it could be either.

But don't look for extras--out takes, commentaries, promo commercials or even a ""behind the scenes""; because it isn't on this wonderful 5 disc set. I say wonderful because the packaging is awesome. It is one jewel case with single sided DVDs which take no more room than at best 2 DVDs on the shelf, which goes into a cardboard sleeve. It comes with a booklet to explain each episode and the characters. The DVD artwork is good. The DVDs are clearly marked and the ""menu"" screen is simple. You can play ALL episodes at once or select individual ones.

As far as the quality, it might not have been digitally remastered as you can literally see the ""scratches"" in the file. The DVDs play without skipping and the episodes are just as wonderful as I remember them being.

If you love the series, here it is. I can not wait for the rest of the seasons and hope they are as quickly released as Nash Bridges has been.",1161302400,11,2512,4.112474437627812

However, I'd still rather wait until Warner does get off the stick, for reasons of quality; not to mention the fact that Warner's more likely to be around to complain to about any problems. ;) S&K was one of the best action/comedy shows I've ever seen. Boxleitner and Jackson made perfect foils for each other. Watching the relationship between Lee and Amanda develop through the show was engrossing; the supporting cast was great; the plots nicely combined humor with danger and intrigue, and later, romance. I loved ongoing themes like Lee shooting Amanda's ideas down, then his chagrin when they worked out. Amanda's constant struggle to keep her mother and boys in the dark about her secret career was a hoot. Even with all the humor, when danger came up, it was real.

1548063,5,B00005JOJR,"I agree the the DVD set is long overdue.  Three seasons of Remington Steele have been released.  What's the hold up?  If you're desperate for a fix, streaming video of about a dozen or so SMK episodes is available on the internet.  (It's against amazon.com review guidelines to put the URL in the review, but it was listed in the May 29 TV Guide).  The video quality isn't that great, but until the DVDs are released, it's something.",1148428800,8,433,4.5
1548064,5,B00005JOJR,"At the risk of sounding really corny, I just have to say how much it would mean to me to have Scarecrow and Mrs. King released on DVD.  This show has always been my favorite show and it would mean a lot to have quality versions of this show on DVD finally.

My teenage years were spent growing up in the 1980's and so I have a lot of fond memories of the televsion shown back then.  I loved Hart to Hart and Remington Steele and I've noticed they've made it to DVD.  A least one season of H to H and Remington has 3 seasons out now.  Please, consider releasing Scarecrow and Mrs. King.  I know there is a pretty sizable fan base out there who would gobble these DVD's up like a house on fire.

For those of you who have never seen Scarecrow and Mrs. King, you are missing out.  This is just a fun show.  The characters are great, the chemistry between Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner is exciting and it's just an all around enjoyable show to lose yourself in for awhile.

So, to the powers that be, please release Scarecrow and Mrs. King on DVD.  Thanks!",1148428800,8,1056,4.178217821782178
1548065,5,B00005JOJR,I love this show and have every episode on tape.  I have been waiting to get this on DVD and have real quality shows without commercials and ends cut off.  I have friends and relatives who are waiting for this show to come out on DVD also.  It has a huge following and deserves to be in a box set!,1148256000,8,297,3.9166666666666665
1548066,5,B00005JOJR,I have never watched a show before or after Scarecrow & Mrs. King that was as captivating as this show. I couldn't wait each week for the show to come on.

It's the romance,the humor, and the element of suspence that keeps you coming back for more. Not to mention Bruce Boxleitner is such a hunk. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD, I hope it is very SOON!",1146873600,11,371,3.8947368421052633
1548068,5,B00005JOJR,"I remember when Scarecrow and Mrs. King came out in the 80's and was hook the very first episode. You just can't get any better than these two characters in a series, the freshness they brought to the show and the chemisty that they had toward each other. With all the other shows on televisions I just can't wait for this one to come on DVD, because  it will be in my collection of series to get. On the rainy days when nothing else is on t.v. you can pull out the dvds and just lay back and relive the days and the adventures of Scarecrow and Mrs. King. So pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee, pleaseeeeeeeeee put this show on DVD",1146441600,10,638,4.406779661016949
1548138,4,B00005JOJR,"This is one of those shows from the eighties that had charm and  real chemistry between its main stars. Kate Jackson was a lot of fun to watch as divorced woman becoming spy. Bruce Boxleitner was my first real crush and a suave leading man who didn't take himself too seriously. Like most of the shows I remember from the 80's this seems to have been over looked by the studios. Thanks to cable I don't watch any network shows. However, along with ""Sledgehammer"", ""It's a Living"" and this show I could relive the 80's. Please release it on dvd. I would like to buy a whole season at a time though. The main reason for this is space. I have so many dvd's that storage is a problem.",1146355200,13,680,4.271317829457364

Now that I live in the States, I not only want to watch the show again, I also want to own all the seasons on DVD. I have been waiting for years and the wait is driving me NUTS! Please, I am begging you; bring back the friends from my childhood who inspired me to see the world! Many of the other great shows of the 80s are on DVD...",1145750400,12,505,3.8190476190476192

1548141,5,B00005JOJR,"I barely remembered the show, but liked it. I found out over on AOLtv.com they show episodes of it and have been hooked watching them night after night. This show has a lot in common with one of my other favorite shows: Moonlighting, but with its own wonderful chemistry and flavor. Regarding what the other person said about it being repetitive, show me any tv show that doesnt get at least a little repetitive and use the same formulas after the first season ALL tv is like that no matter what the show. What makes it entertaining is watching how the game is played out between the characters not the game itself. I will be ordering a season boxed set of this the minute it comes out, a wonderfully entertaining show a little James Bond, a bit of comedy, and a lot of sexual tension done in just the right way. I was actually pretty surprised with how real world (for the 80's) they made the spy part, its really more realistic than James Bond, but just as much fun.",1145059200,9,968,4.383333333333334

1548144,5,B00005JOJR,"I couldn't believe it when I saw that ""Hart to Hart"" was on DVD, but not Scarecrow and Mrs. King.  This is one that so many of us grew up on, and now you can appreciate it all the more.  How cool is it to see characters actually talk and have personality and not just have sex and then dump each other inside of two episodes?

  The allure of this series was the brilliant and often funny culture clash between the prim housewife and the dashing secret agent.  They were the Scully and Mulder of their time: usually bickering and not understanding each other, but ultimately working together and teasing the audience with relationship tension that always kept us coming back.

  They don't write shows like this very often.  You have to watch ""Lost"" now if you want real boy/girl tension, and the  heroism that was mainstream in the 80s is all but extinct in modern TV.

  We've also learned that terrible reality shows rule the schedule (""The Bachelor,"" Skating with Celebrities), icky shows rule the popular crowd (CSI, Fear Factor), truly stellar shows  get canceled (Firefly), and classics like Scarecrow need to be revived.

  We need it now, more than ever!",1137715200,22,1163,4.673267326732673
1548145,3,B00005JOJR,"This several year series has a lot in common with Hogan's Heroes.  The plots are minor variations on the same theme.  If you like the interaction between the characters you will not get bored.  If not you will quickly tire of the program.  After a while seeing scarecrow hiding outside Mrs King's kitchen window and talking with her in the presence of the King mother who is oblivious to what is going on becomes tediously boring.

If you have not seen the program before I suggest that you buy the minimum amount of the program and view it before you buy the whole series.",1137110400,6,573,4.471153846153846

7941199,4,B00005JOJR,"The first season of Scarecrow and Mrs. King is, as with most series, about the main cast getting comfortable with their roles and each other. The stories are good, the acting in some places, fair, but for the most part good! Bruce Boxleitner and Beverly Garland do a great job with their roles, and Kate Jackson keeps getting better as the episodes progress. A fun series! RP",1524009600,,375,4.611940298507463
