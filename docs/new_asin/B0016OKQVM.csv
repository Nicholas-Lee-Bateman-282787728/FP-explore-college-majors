8354338,5,B0016OKQVM,I teach journalism in middle school and sometimes they need to see things to be able to understand it and this video is great! I made a little worksheet to go along with this video and it helped them stay engaged. They also had lots of questions and it always leads to great discussions afterword. The video is well done and would love to see another one that continues with the rapid changes in media and the use of internet.,1249084800,4,426,4.3375
