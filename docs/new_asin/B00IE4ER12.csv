6260507,5,B00IE4ER12,"Have just watched this series for the THIRD time, and still uncover marvellous clues and hints, and as always sit amazed at the writing and at the acting. The producers' commitment to use local actors, sometimes novices, is a resounding success. Gone are the days when the BBC or other monolith would ship an elite London cast to, say, North Wales, and create ""a Welsh story.""",1508716800,,376,4.712121212121212

Can't wait to binge the rest. Brenda Blethyn was one of my favorites before this show; it's a real treat to have her in the lead for this > a middle-aged woman who is in charge leading her team, uses her brain and isn't expected to be a sex object,  is very refreshing.",1491004800,,418,4.160493827160494

6260554,4,B00IE4ER12,"Vera Series 4 (2014) introduces a new, younger police pathologist Dr. Marcus Summer (Kingsley Ben-Adir), who is not as much of a personality as his predecessor Dr. Billy Cartwright. We learn that DC Rebecca Shep Shepherd (Clare Calbraith) was formerly a military policewoman, which explains her demeanor and knowledge of weapons. DS Joe Ashworth (David Leon) is still Veras second, and DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison) still does spade work and puts of with a lot of teasing. Brenda Blethyn carries the show as the frumpy, pushy, DCI Vera Stanhope of the Northumberland & City Police, who always gets her killer, eventually. Only On Harbour Street is based on an Ann Cleeves novel; the rest are original stories. Three out of four mysteries find their motives for murder in the past, which has become a tired theme and cop-out for lazy writers. The DVDs (Acorn 2014) include scene menus, optional English subtitles, and the forth disc features a Photo Gallery of publicity and production stills.

The episodes are:

DS Joe Ashworths (David Leon) young daughter Jessie (Olivia Armstrong) discovers an elderly woman stabbed to death on a subway train in On Harbour Street. The victim is Margaret Krazowski (Annabel Leventon), who lived in a guest house in the seaside town of Mardle, for which she had done the accounts for several decades. Her employer and longtime acquaintance was Kate Darrow (Eva Birthistle), whom Vera feels is hiding something. As it happens, the boatman who works nearby, Malcolm Kenrich (Paul Copely), another of Margarets longtime acquaintances, had also taken a young Vera and her father hunting in the area many years before. A missing ex-husband and aging prostitute Deirdre Dee Sinton (Tilly Vosburgh), formerly a successful businesswoman, are among the clues that convince Vera that the solution to the mystery lies in Margarets past. Meanwhile, a new pathologist, Marcus Summer (Kingsley Ben-Adir), is introduced at the station.

In Protected, 37-year-old real estate developer David Kenworthy (Rob Jarman) is found bludgeoned to death on the beach during a weekend celebration. He had been at the anniversary party he threw for his retiring father Alan Kenworthy, a local real estate magnate, and his step-mother Karen (Christine Kavanagh). Davids father was about to turn the company over to his son, who had been researching land values in Whitley Bay with an eye to developing. The investigation leads to a local arcade owner, Larry Crowe (Dave Hill), who held a grudge against the Kenworthy family, since his teenaged son died at their house years ago. Vera and Joe dig deeper into the familys interrelationships and become increasingly frustrated with the inability to locate Davids cell phone that was turned over to the police the night he died. By luck, they find Davids estranged older sister Lorna (Teresa Banham), who might hold the key to the case.

Struggling novelist Shane Thurgood is found shot to death on the fells, a short distance from where a truck belonging to deer poachers was torched in The Deer Hunters. Thurgood was a native of this rural area who had returned to deal with probate on his grandfathers farm. He intended to sell the farm to the Peyton family, owners of a nearby lodge and museum, eager to acquire the land. At first, Thurgood is suspected of poaching, along with Linus Campion (William Ash), whose truck was burned that night with a stag in the back. Vera thinks the murderers motives may lie in the past so reads Thurgoods only published novel for clues. Queen Mabs Fool was based on the authors relationship with the Barnes family, in particular daughters, Clara (Lisa Kay), now married to Will Peyton (Richard Dillane) and Vanessa (Kellie Bright). He was trained as a tracker by their father Allen Barnes (Clive Russell). Picturesque countryside features prominently in this episode.

Death of a Family Man finds the body of business owner John Shearwood in the river, while family and co-workers thought he was in Dublin on a business trip. It might have been a suicide, but his shoelaces were tied together, and there is evidence that John was in a fistfight shortly before he died. An agent of HMRC (Revenue & Customs), Owen Preece (Robert Glenister), approaches Vera to inform her that John had been working as an informant for two years, informing on his old friend and employee Mark Donovan (Tim Dantay), who was using the company to deal in illicit booze. Vera is reluctant to delay her investigation to satisfy HMRC. Johns wife Stella (Maibritt Saerens) claims ignorance that he was in the country at the time of his death; his son Billy (Billy Howle) has a history of drug abuse and petty crime, since he was involved in a car accident that killed a young boy years before. But everyone who had motive seemingly has an alibi, leaving Vera baffled.",1483056000,,4833,4.983890954151177

6260568,5,B00IE4ER12,Vera is a more realistic woman detective than the plethora of model-quality actresses playing similar roles today.  Blethyn is around 70 and has the grace of a 50-year old.

I'm not sure why all the British series need to give their main characters such difficult home lives, but Vera is no exception.  The landscape is bleak and dark and that fits the story lines.  Kudos to this ensemble cast.",1474848000,,363,4.806451612903226
6260600,5,B00IE4ER12,....And it continues....EXCELLENT SERIES!!!,1474848000,,43,10.0
6260601,5,B00IE4ER12,"To me, Vera is exactly the speed of murder mystery I enjoy. The British style is evident, the accents make it personable, and Vera's sympathy towards real victims reads well, while her Columbo-like laser-focus on the perpetrator is equally fun. Her often condescending treatment of Kenny aside, she protects her team when they do well, and chides them when they fall down. It's a very realistic-feeling drama which reminds me not just a little of ""Frost"", which I used to call ""Tea and Half-Finished Sentences."" In this one, the tea is still prevalent, but most of the sentences at least get finished.",1474848000,,601,4.901960784313726

6260748,5,B00IE4ER12,"The Vera series is, quite simply, superb.  Brenda Blethyn is a wonderful actress who can convey more with a shrug or facial expression than most actors can with a whole speech.  The writing on this series is also consistently excellent.  The more I watch any of the mystery series, British or American, the more I realize who hard it is to write a plausible mystery plot.  This series rivals the Prime Suspect Series with Helen Mirren in excellent plotting and writing.  Finally, the producers and directors of this series have beautifully captured the visual sense of place -- the sea, the moors, the hills and the towns, that populate the Ann Cleeves novels.  A delight.",1446076800,2,672,4.8
6260749,4,B00IE4ER12,"Vera is a classic detective of the ""Columbo"" ilk played by the fabulous Brenda Bletthyn. For one thing, she's almost never without a coat and scarf (and often a mashed-down rain hat). When you see her with it off, it's rather shocking because she seems to be wearing old-fashioned house dresses. The stories are often full of twists and turns, and the setting, in the far north of England, is a fascinating character in itself. The best thing to do with this series is to start with season 1 and follow it through; as with many such series, we gradually get to know Vera, her young partner, and her staff. Get used to everyoneincluding the perpsbeing called ""luv"" and ""pet.""",1445558400,4,674,4.625

She and her partner a perfect crime solving pair. Now, in season 4 the plots seem scattered, hollow. Vera's character is no longer so deep or funny or tragic. FLAT. Bad writing? Bad directing?. David Leon (ever the drop dead handsome bloke) basically phoning it in maybe because his character has been so simplified and he's not coming back for the next season.
I miss the vast room where they would all work out details on the wall, the visits to Vera's house, dark and cluttered with her demons ever present, talks with Joe about her childhood, the pervy pathologist, his jokes and Vera's quips her messy hair and sloppy hat. I must say I bitterly disappointed and not looking forward to the next season without Joe.",1439942400,,858,4.76510067114094

6260868,5,B00IE4ER12,"""Vera"" is a tremendous visual and imaginative treat. Always superb, Brenda Blethyn is the driving, elemental force that is Detective Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope: salt of the earth. Blethyn's face is as expressive and interesting as the blustery northern English landscape, weathering storms of conflict within and without. Blethyn grew up in unpretentious, working-class circumstances, and brings that richness of experience to her role. Great mystery series go beyond the genre to encompass a wide range of life-issues; ""Vera"" explores complexity beautifully. Filmed in clouded northern light, with nuanced shades of human emotion, DCI Vera Stanhope's unresolved pathos over her lonely life underlines the narrative. Slugging down whisky under sullen clouds, Vera once declared that solitude is not for the faint-hearted. Northumberland is another character, its rolling hills and rough coastline, the heavy line of the sea, castle ruins, and towns hit hard by decades of economic hardship, providing a unique canvas for these mysteries. Houses huddle under a leaden sky that slams down at the end of the street, a permanent dead-end. The northern dialect, strewn with a heritage of Viking remnants, is as hefty and delicious as meat-pies and ale. Northumberland's northern light and wave-tossed seascapes provide a timelessness to the human narrative strewn upon the landscape.

The haunting soundtrack, by Ben Bartlett, adds an ominous depth to the series. The marvelous Brenda Blethyn is amazing; she and the rest of the talented crew authentically bring alive the mystery novels of Ann Cleves. The series is further enlivened by a great cast. David Leon is excellent as Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, coping with Vera's dark moods and worrying over her health. Jon Morrison plays long-suffering Detective Constable Kenny Lockhart, Sonya Cassidy perfectly depicts Sergeant Joe Ashworth's wife Celine, and Clare Calbraith is newcomer DC Rebecca Shpherd. In the U.K., theater, movie, and television productions value actors who are robustly, deeply human, and provide venues like this series that share this wealth of talent.

6260872,5,B00IE4ER12,"Vera's back and criminals better beware. Vera Stanhope, played brilliantly by Oscar-nominated Brenda Blethyn, is sometimes described as a 'female Columbo,' but she's far craftier and more single-minded than the trenchcoat-wearing legend. Vera's workaholic ways may exasperate her staff, especially Det. Sgt. Joe Ashworth (David Leon) but her patient, persistent crime solving  always pays. The Northumberland setting provides stark and beautiful backdrops for evil doings. These four new stories are completely absorbing and even the most skilled amateur sleuths among us cannot beat Vera to the solution. Acorn thoughtfully provides subtitles for the sometimes unfamiliar accents. Vera, please solve more crimes and keep us entertained for many more seasons.",1419033600,2,759,5.963302752293578

Therefore, I suggest readers of this review not take too seriously the three stars, because I would have absolutely given the first three seasons Five Stars.  In the first episode of Season Four, what I truly did not like was the sappy presence of David Leon.  Yes, there are evidently ""bad"" things happening in his marriage, but he was previously so vital, and the repartee between his character and ""Vera"" was so much more snappy in the first three seasons, I have to wonder if there are different writers on board.  Everything seemed slowed down, almost sloppy.  The story line was all right, although a little difficult to follow in places -- leaps made that if one misses a sentence or two, one might be confused from there on.  Even the accents were less ""authentic"" perhaps because there have been some complaints (here) that the accents made the words hard to understand.  I'm sorry to have to give this first episode three stars, but again, hope that readers will not make a judgement about the entire season based on this review of only one episode.  I, myself, will be watching all the episodes and hope that the acting, writing, and pace of the show in Season Four will pick up.",1418515200,6,1368,4.643153526970955

6260887,5,B00IE4ER12,"Review of DVD  NO SPOILERS!  Another great set with easy to read subtitles

First, off, know that Amazon will often group reviews of different formats of a film or TV series (streaming, and various regions) so, when reading a review, you should note which version the review is commenting on.

If youve come to this review, you have probably already seen Series 1 through 3 and know the basic characters for this wonderful mystery series produced by the commercial ITV network in the UK (as opposed to the BBC). So I won't rehash that info. Like the previous sets there are four approximately 90 minute episodes  one on each DVD in the package. Each has a murder (or two or three) that must be solved by DCI Vera Stanhope portrayed by the wonderful actress Brenda Blethyn. Vera and her team work in northern England and the country scenery (especially in the third story in this set) is gorgeous. As others have pointed out there is some graphic violence to be aware of, but no profanity. Some compare the frumpy Vera to Peter Falks detective Columbo but I don't see much of a similarity other than their attire.

Some reviewers here have posted the plot summaries that show up on your screen before you get to select the Play button. Im not sure they add much to enjoying the stories. After all they are mysteries. The murders happen at the beginning and they are solved by the end. So I won't discuss the plots.

I will point out that for the US NTSC release Acorn has added English subtitles in really easy to read YELLOW fonts. While I can easily understand what Vera is saying, some of the regional accents can be a bit tough so Ive enjoyed using the subtitles. Its also interesting that sometime the subtitles add info you might not hear (a certain sound) or provide the name of a character whose name is not spoken. I think Acorn should be thanked for providing what I consider the best (well, easiest to read) subtitles of all the companies releasing British TV series in the US.
The other nice thing about th8is series is that not a lot of time is spent on personal lives of the crime team. It happens occasionally but not often and each story can stand on its own.

If youve come to this volume by watching the previous ones, youll certainly enjoy this one. Yes, you could start here but I really like starting with Series one of any series.

There are no special bonus features on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6260888,5,B00IE4ER12,"DCI Vera Stanhope of Northumberland is my kind of detective. In this series 4, she has a new haircut, which is more akin to wind blown and the absence of a hairbrush. She dresses for warmth, not style, although her raincoat is fashionable, and her sturdy shoes look as if they are handmade. All this discussion of her sense or lack of style is necessary to get the full picture of this detective. She is someone you feel you can trust, however, you cannot pull the wool over her. She knows when you are lying. Vera is down to earth, dresses for warmth, eats when she can, drinks more often, and her life as a DCI is her life.

Brenda Blethyn plays Vera, and she is absolutely brilliant. She has the ability to transform herself into Vera, her actions, her speech and her essence demand respect. In this series we are privy to more information about Vera's childhood, as she relays bits and pieces to her DS Joe Ashworth, played by David Leon. Joe, has a young family and a beautiful wife who wants the best. This causes discomfort and dissension in the family, and this is prominent in seep real of the episodes.

Series 4 as usual provides the best in acting, writing and directing. The episodes are all new and reality driven. We can see this happening in any neighborhood. These episodes take place in Northumberland, the moors, the desolate places and the nicer neighborhoods. Vera has a cast of characters who are all put in their place, she wants them to work harder, do more, bring in the clues and help solve the crimes. In series 4, a new young pathologist arrives, and he brings some needed romance and mystery. I found this series 4 to be one of the best of the 4 series. I have read test a series 5 has been ordered, David Leon will not reprise his role, so, a new DS will be introduced. Looking forward.

6260889,4,B00IE4ER12,"Not only am I a fan of Vera, the television series, I love both series of police procedurals by Ann Cleeves (the books) with which I'm familiar -- this one and the so-called Shetland mysteries. I found Vera Season 4 at my local library, so don't automatically assume you have to break the bank to continue enjoying this. In each season, there's one stand-out episode that has a superior plot, the best acting, even the most atmospheric soundtrack. In Season 4, it's ""Protected."" About half way through when some astonishing secrets were revealed, I started watching it again from the beginning. I didn't want to miss one clue, one facial expression, one moment of Vera's deductive reasoning. These four episodes are all quite good, but this one is equal in quality to ""Young Gods"" in Season 3. This might have been five stars except that Billy, the medical examiner, has been replaced by a young actor who does double duty as love interest for Shep. I think he'll be fine, but I don't like change. When Billy sang Bruno Mars' ""Grenade"" to Vera in a wild falsetto voice last season, he won my heart completely.

She coos and calls people ""love"" and ""pet"" and then goes in for the kill during interrogations. She's not much kinder to her hard working crew of detectives either.

Discs two and four are especially brilliant and absorbing.  The cast has been cheapened a bit by the presence of a young black hunk (think PC) as the pathologist, and he's making out with a much-too-attractive white detective on Vera's squad.  Aside from that, the stories are fascinating and the acting, directing and camera work are out of sight.  How can something of this caliber be made in a dying culture?  Well, don't miss it.

This is a very real character that you keep rooting for.  I also love the backdrop scenic views of the English northern towns and cities and, in particular, the cold and somehow fearful North Sea that I remember visiting once in my youth (in comparison the English Channel in the south is so mild).

Cases as violent as the country is ruggedly beautiful.

The longer this series continues, the more intense the situations get. Good crime drama with many ongoing character threads. If you like Midsomer Murders, you will like Vera.",1412294400,12,1703,5.129963898916968
6260915,5,B00IE4ER12,"Just finished watching Season 4 on Acorn TV.  Wish they made more episodes. I love her character and while she is a tad crusty and seemingly unreasonable to her staff, it is easy to see through to how much she genuinely cares for them. These are outstanding mysteries that are typically not solved until the very last minute. Can't wait for season 5.",1410739200,27,350,4.555555555555555

6260917,2,B00IE4ER12,"I tried to like this show. Watched three episodes before bailing. Quite apart from being hard to understand (and I'm British), the lead character Vera is obnoxious. She's an unprofessional shrieking fishwife with no respect for her co-workers. I'm a big fan of British mysteries and police procedurals, but this is an exception. Not recommended.",1410393600,4,345,5.290909090909091
6260918,5,B00IE4ER12,"Love Love Vera! Smart drama, I can watch it over & over again. Very detailed, lots of texture & layers, Vera is always thinking.
I wish it did not take sooooo long for sets  to be released.  I'm ready now for set 5.",1408492800,25,215,3.9767441860465116
6260919,5,B00IE4ER12,"VERA, Set 4. (2011- ) This is a new, contemporaneously set British television series made by ITV. The British mystery series/police procedural, in its 2014 fourth season, returned to record ratings in the United Kingdom. The series has aired in the United States on PBS channels. It is based on the best-selling mysteries of British author Ann Cleeves, and like her work, is set in the extreme northeast of England, Geordie-land, just under the Roman-built Hadrian's Wall, which separates England from Scotland.

The production stars two-time Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn (LITTLE VOICE, SECRETS AND LIES, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, ATONEMENT) as DCI Vera Stanhope, a solitary, obsessed, caustic investigator with a messy persona and private life. She's 40 pounds overweight, a bit disheveled; dresses for comfort and warmth --think female Columbo -- in the brutal Northumberland winters. It is available streaming or in a boxed set that includes four feature-length, character-driven crime dramas on four discs, runs 370 minutes. For mature audiences. A photo gallery comes as an extra. And thank you, RLJ Entertainment-Acorn, it's got subtitles: otherwise don't know what we'd do with the local accent on this side of the pond. I received this as a review copy.

Stanhope pursues the truth in the cases of murder, kidnapping, and blackmail that occur on her patch of Geordie-land. She's driven by her own demons; fails to follow the rules of proper nutrition; hides her loneliness well; drinks more than she ought. We're told she lost her mother as a young child, was raised by a distant father, is estranged from her only sister. She's a complex character: a brilliant, independent cop with a dumb private life; a character that undoubtedly requires an actress of Blethyn's skill.  In addition to her sidekick Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, as played by David Leon, who characterizes his part with an odd, bowlegged walk, as if he were malnourished as a child and had rickets, she's supported in the cop shop by Paul Ritter and Jon Morrison. The episodes are, to quote RLJ/Acorn:

Disc 1
EPISODE 1: On Harbour Street
Stanhope investigates the stabbing death of a senior citizen aboard a crowded rush-hour trainand learns that the chief witness to the woman's killing is Ashworth's young daughter. The case takes the detectives to a tightknit community in the quiet coastal town where the victim lived and where, Stanhope suspects, the killer knew her well.

Disc 2
EPISODE 2: Protected
When a young man is beaten to death along the seafront at a popular resort, Stanhope wonders why he was there rather than at his father's retirement party. Suspicion falls on a local arcade owner with a grudge against the father. However, the inspector believes the answers may lie with the deceased's own familythe domineering patriarch, stepmother, underachieving brother, and a sister who appears not to have had contact with the others for years.
Disc 3
EPISODE 3: The Deer Hunters
Two local poachers are shot at and their truck torchedwhile less than a mile away, a man recently returned to the area is killed with a single round from a hunting rifle. The gamekeeper from the nearby estate denies involvement in the incidents, and Stanhope and Ashworth keep all their options open as they enter a world dominated by rural tradition and life on the moors.
Disc 4
EPISODE 4: Death of a Family Man
Was the dead body found in a local river a case of suicide or murder? The victim was a successful businessman who was supposed to be on a business trip to Dublin. The waters muddy further when Stanhope and Ashworth discover that other law-enforcement authorities are interested in the man and that there was more to his family life than met the eye.

I love this series, loved Set 3, which I reviewed on its website in these pages, and have got to manage somehow to double back to Sets 1 and 2. These powerful free-standing episodes have been filmed in the original villages of the Cleeves crime novels; the bleak, lonely landscapes of Northumberland, a region of the U.K. that has traditionally suffered, and still does, from underemployment,  look beautiful here.  The mysteries are muscular, and so, uniformly, is the acting, with particular praise due Blethyn, who has created a very strong yet vulnerable character. The stories are dark and realistic, dealing with middle and lower class people, in contrast to most glossy American cop shows, female-centered or not.  In further contrast to the female leads of most American TV cop shows, Vera's not young, pretty, sexy or well-dressed. She doesn't have a husband, or a lover, and doesn't seem interested in getting one. She doesnt have a social or family life and doesnt seem interested in getting one. She's interested in getting her perps, man or woman, and she does.",1408147200,62,4809,4.986284289276808
