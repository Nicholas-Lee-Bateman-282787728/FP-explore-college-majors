8356658,5,B0028R1M9G,"A charming little award-winning indy film that harkens back to the days of interesting characters with an original plot that has funny and unexpected turns. A great sound track and family friendly, too!  But, what do I know, I'm the producer's wife - just being honest.",1361145600,,269,4.8478260869565215
8356659,1,B0028R1M9G,"the music is freaking horrible, & the characters look like they're from the '70s. Could turn out to be good but after 2 aweful songs w/in 10 minutes I couldn't take anymore.",1341619200,,173,4.4375
8356660,4,B0028R1M9G,"this movie is quite good.  It has great shots of San FRANCISCO and a great soundtrack by Craig Long.  The acting is very good, especially since they are all unknowns.  I'm glad I bought it.",1281484800,,189,4.3428571428571425
8356661,1,B0028R1M9G,"I forgot to check the distributor when I ordered this - and once again Vanguard lets out another complete dud made to look like a 1970s TV film. I gave it a fair shot though as I love watching San Francisco films. This disappointed in every way except for the City - but let's make this quick so you can move on.

The picture, sound and DVD quality are all very poor. The DVD menu had spelling errors, there were no special features and the overall look succeeded in appearing older as this was made almost 10 years ago. The acting was laughable, and there were several scenes (edited to look like they were days apart) that were obviously filmed at the same time, except the cast changed shirts (doubt the AMR ambulance rig would stay parked at exact same spot for a week on a busy SF street/park, numerous other background flubs, etc.).

A light evening rental for those that want to see some SF streetscapes from early 2000 time period and reminisce for that Barney Miller/Streets of San Francisco feel (but much worse). Skipper.",1251072000,,1032,4.543010752688172
