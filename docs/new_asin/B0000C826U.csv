7998262,5,B0000C826U,This is a great DVD. Bill's music combined with his rather hallucinatory images taken from real life make this one something great for repeated viewings. You will always notice different things each time the images are flashed before your eyes. Bills music that accompanies these short art films flows perfectly in time and enhances the magical effect. His art gallery that is included in the special features is phenominal. Bill is one of the most extraoridinary artists of our time and a brilliant musician. His solo work throughout the eighties and nineties was amazing. His collaborations with artists such as David Sylvian (Gone To Earth) have also been of the highest calibre. Don't miss this one.,1069632000,13,703,5.068965517241379
