1212671,4,B00000G0CS,"You know the story: man about to be executed and last minute fight to save him. The only thing is, the directing and acting by Clint Eastwood is so good and the story line is so riveting, that it holds you and grabs you in  the gut, from beginning to end. All of the acting is worth the price and  Eastwood's real daughter (who plays his little girl inthe movie),  is  amazing in her short acting bits. What a kid!  As the recovered  alcoholic newspaper reporter, Eastwood still has the nose for the truth in  this good script.  If you favor capital punishment, you may think it  through again after seeing this film.",952387200,8,617,4.389380530973451
1212672,3,B00000G0CS,"This is a decent, if not stellar, movie rental for those who like mystery/morality plays.  I rented the video and then bought a previously-viewed copy to keep because of the fine support performances by  Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton; these 2 tug your heartstrings with  their portrayal of a loving couple facing the ultimate separation of an  enforced death penalty.  If you have the patience to sit through all the  side stories (and there are way too many) told to illustrate that Clint's  character is an aging hack without a personal life or moral conviction to  speak of, then you'll see some great acting by Washington and Hamilton, as  well as James Woods as Clint's editor.  Other stupid side stuff: the  inclusion of Clint's ex partner, their daughter, and his current wife in  cameo roles and some haggling-for-money-sexual harrassment scenes by a  homeless man intended to be humorous but which were just annoying and  dragged the movie out still further.  In conclusion, this film needed a  much tighter editor/story but the supporting cast still makes it worth  viewing.",948499200,3,1094,5.022346368715084
1212673,4,B00000G0CS,"In True Crime, Clint Eastwood continues to deconstruct the roles he played in earlier movies.  This is Dirty Harry without the psychos and mean shootouts.  It's the Eastwood anti-hero dealing with the consquences of  being an anti-hero.  In other words, what Unforgiven was to his western  films, True Crime is to the Dirty Harry movies, though not quite as  good.
Over the last month, it's the first movie I've seen that maintained  my interest and I suspect this is largely because it's more concerned with  its storyline than with focus group feedback.  The movie is also much, much  more than Clint Eastwood.  Isaiah Washington delivers a wonderful  performance in what has to be the most difficult of roles - playing a nice  guy.  And James Woods is masterful as the verbally brilliant editor.
There are also musical gems in this film, like Diana Krall doing  ""Why Do I Care?""  Overall, while not a great film, this is a  very, very good one and I don't understand how it arrived and left with so  little notice.",947376000,,1017,4.714285714285714
1212674,1,B00000G0CS,"As a long term clint Eastwood fan, I found this movie to be a big disappointment. Eastwood's direction is poor, the excitment that should have been present in the story was not there. I found his acting much  better than his directing. I did enjoy some of the other performances,  especially James Woods. The movie is worth renting but I would not buy it.",945561600,6,355,4.53125
1212675,4,B00000G0CS,"I've read the reviews from other people, and felt they were a bit unfair. I completly agree that seeing Clint half-naked isn't the best scene in the movie, that the plot is somehow predictible, and Clint should play  womanizers anymore.
Still, Clint is still a fantastic actor, the  performance by Isaiah Washington is nothing less than outstanding.
The  movie itself has a light smell of the 70s, which remind the Dirty Harry  days.
I enjoyed this movie, I can also accept some people didn't, but I  think it was good",942796800,10,518,4.711111111111111
1212676,5,B00000G0CS,"Eastwood climbs off of his hero's horse and delivers a brilliant performance as a degenerate newspaper reporter with a talent for ""smelling"" the truth. Once again, Clint puts together a stunning  supporting cast. People fail to see the genius in Eastwood because of the  subtle way in which he goes about his acting/directing. Though not of the  caliber of ""Unforgiven"", this is a must see, tip of your toes  thriller, starring the most popular actor in history ( he edged out John  Wayne 2 yrs. ago). C.B.",938131200,3,506,4.7701149425287355
1212677,4,B00000G0CS,"Eastwood's directorial debut was ""The Unforgiven"", a stylistic return to the glory days of the western. This time he has entered a new one, films about the death penalty. Eastwood plays a barely-sober hack  newspaper reporter. His character is very enigmatic, although I think that  was much more to do with Clint than with the story. He is walking a fine  line between being a brilliant asset to the paper and being fired. You see,  he has a tendancy to go on crusades, and he is about to embark on a fresh  one with his current writing assignment. His job is to write a ""human  interest sidebar"" about the execution of an accused murderer. The  problem is, Clint thinks he's innocent. Is Clint stupid for going off half  cocked? Is he just being reckless with his career, or is he brave in  standing up for what he beleives is right? These are the questions the film  asks us to contemplate as Eastwood gets clues and revelations about the  case. I like to see Eastwood in this type of role, which is quite similar  to that burgler one a few years ago. A low key guy struggling with his role  in life. Quiet and subdued, he constantly wonders about what is the right  thing to do. I was never a fan of ""Dirty Harry"", or those Sergio  Leone films. We see a rare raw side of Clint Eastwood the man here, instead  of Clint Eastwood the cardboard cutout. The title says it all, this is  realistic, not superhero fantasy.",934761600,3,1418,4.434108527131783
1212789,2,B00000G0CS,"This film is almost 20 years old, so it brings back to life the days of smoking in the workplace, drinking from flasks at your desk, and rampant, soul-crushing sexism that made me, a fifty-something dude who is no stranger to newsrooms, want to take a Silkwood shower in the fetal position out of embarrassment for my gender.

Clint Eastwood plays a borderline sociopathic, womanizing, recently-on-the-wagon drunk who has built a career of hunch-based journalism. If that sounds like a libel suit just waiting to happen, it's because this reporter is protected by a top editor who is just as sleazy, only his desk is neater and he has an office. Eastwood's character has raspy, carnal Eastwood relations with the wife of a managing editor (Denis Leary) who is such a tool that it's easy to root for the infidelity.

Much more likable: Isaiah Washington as the wrongly convicted prisoner and his tender family, with actual heartfelt, gripping emotion.

Much less believable: That even a washed-up investigative reporter would be stupid enough to start trying to prove actual innocence a few hours before the execution. I know we tend to be deadline-oriented, but Jesus.

Most of the characters in this film  from the district attorney to the sources whom Eastwood interviews to the prison chaplain to pretty much everyone at this newspaper save one sweet editorial assistant  are horrible, walking employment lawsuits, and I say this as someone who has demonstrated huge patience and appreciation for the neuroatypical demographic who are drawn to the newspaper business.

If you are a human being with empathy, you probably won't like this film.",1514332800,2,1645,5.07037037037037
1212790,2,B00000G0CS,"Except if you like witnessing a veritable cabaret of old skool sexism & misogyny. Eastwood is at least 20 if not 30 years older than the women in this movie he is married to or womanizes with or attempts to womanize with. His playa prowess is...kinda boggling. His character is the kind of charming that's not, and the way he describes himself....he sounds and acts like a sociopath, not really caring about anything but his ""hunches""

We go through the set pieces of Eastwood's Everett being a jackass to his co-workers (he's banging his bosses wife) his wife, his daughter - who he accidentally injures - while the REAL interesting story is the *STORY* Everett's reporter is trying to get.  Isaiah Washington & Lisa Gay Harden are phenomenal and affecting as the wrongly convicted death row inmate & his wife. The actress that plays their little girl is a heartbreaker.

It's when the action switches back to the jail that really interesting things happen, with the prisoner and the guards that are kind and respectful. And Bernard Hill (LOTR's Theoden) as the formal warden who begins to have doubts at the very very last minute. The movie crackles with energy and characters that have chemistry with one another, and most of that happens when Eastwood is behind and not in front of the camera.

The story is about a bunch of couple of real jerk journalists (James Woods' eats all the scenery) who believe in the power of the hunch and do the right thing, maybe for the right reasons. I honestly don't know if we were supposed to hate Eastwood's character as the extra-strength anti-hero who gets the job done No Matter What The Cost To Himself.  But boy, do I.",1514332800,2,1664,4.684931506849315
1212791,5,B00000G0CS,"What I like the most about this film (True Crime 1999) is the direction and consistent delivery of high quality film from Malpaso Films. Eastwood is more riveting and gruesome than some of his other Malpaso Productions characters in this picture. He is a heavy smoker; derelict, unfaithful spouse, and floundering recovering alcoholic who is on the verge of losing his job as a crime reporter for the Oakland Chronicle. His boss, James Woods, gives a gritty but hilarious performance, as well as Dennis Leary (the husband of one of the women with whom Eastwood philanders with).  Eastwoods character is determined to serve justice to a man who is on death row with 24 hours to live, whose case he has covered since a wrongful conviction, and he does satisfyingly achieve his objective after a series of rough set-backs by people who are only self-centered.",1511568000,,856,4.903448275862069

1212968,5,B00000G0CS,"TRUE CRIME is a color film taking place in the present era.  The film concerns an experienced newspaper reporter for the Oakland Tribune who, on short notice, inherited a story from a novice newspaper reporter, who perished on an automobile accident.  The reporter, played by Mr. Eastwood, has a character with these consistent traits: (1) Alcoholic, (2) Extra-marital dilly-dallying, and (3) Calm, persistent, and non-flappable.

On initially reading Wikipedia's blurb about this movie that it was not a financial success, I kept my eyes open for elements that discourage viewers from enjoying this movie.  Yes, I was able to find elements of this type:  (1) Much of the movie takes place on death row in San Quentin, (2) Clint Eastwood takes his 6-year old daughter to the Oakland zoo, and because he has a work-related appointment later that day, decides to race from animal to animal, pushing his daughter in a baby carriage.  But in his rush, the baby carriage overturns, and the girl gets a bloody gash on her forehead, (3)  In the first ten minutes of this movie, the novice reporter (a young hottie) is diving on a barrow winding riad in the rain, but fools around too much with her car stereo, and she gets in a crash and dies, (4) There are several unpleasant scenes where Clint Eastwood gets angry flack, because of his dilly-dallying with his co-worker's wife.  Okay, most of the movie is occupied by these unpleasant features.  But then, at the same time, the plot has an undercurrent consisting of Mr. Eastwood's sleuthing activities on behalf of the man on death row.  This undercurrent develops into an ocean swell, which eventually develops into a whooshing tidal wave.

The final ten minutes is amazingly clever, and soulfully satisfying, and because of this ending I am compelled to give this movie FIVE STARS.  The movie does have some light-hearted moments, but these are far and few between. The accused murderer has a beautiful 5-year old daughter, who makes crayon drawing of a green meadow with sun above.  Another light-hearted moment, is when Mr. Eastwood tracks down the mother of the suspected real killer (suspected only by Clint Eastwood) and the mother scolds some hoodlums who are infesting the sidewalk in front of her house.  One feature that is consistently admirable, is the accurate depiction of the decrepit nature of Richmond, CA.

PENNY BAE BRIDGES.  Penny Bridges, born in 1990, plays the daughter of the accused killer and death-row inmate.  She plays a major part in this movie, and all viewers will likely be captivated by her dialogue with her father, when her father explains to her that she can still talk to him when he is ""away"" even though it is never explained to her that the term ""away"" means death by lethal injection.  Just as I was charmed by the father/daughter interactions between Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning in WAR OF THE WORLDS, I was charmed by the father/daughter interactions between Isaiah Washington and Penny Bridges in TRUE CRIME.

REQUIRED READING.  Movies with a similar theme to TRUE CRIME are COACH CARTER (2005) starring Samuel L. Jackson and THE PLEDGE (2001) starring Jack Nicholson.  Coach Carter depicts the run-down and decrepit nature of Richmond, CA, along with the street gangs and crime, in much the same way as in TRUE CRIME.  THE PLEDGE concerns a man wrongly accused of murder, and this movie provides an exciting detective hunt for the real killer, in a way similar to that in TRUE CRIME.  In both movies, the man detective work is not supposed to be doing any ""detective work."" In THE PLEDGE, Jack Nicholson is actually retired from the police force, and in TRUE CRIME, Clint Eastwood is actually just a newspaper reporter with the assignment of doing a short human-interest story.  Thus, I recommend Coach Carter and The Pledge, if you want to see movies with themes similar to those in TRUE CRIME.",1483488000,2,3889,4.875379939209727

1213157,5,B00000G0CS,"Fading journalist 'Steve Everett' (Clint Eastwood) a womaniser and hard drinker is given the task to cover the human-story
of convicted for murder 'Frank Beechum' (Isaiah Washington) who is due to be given the 'lethal-injection' at one minute
past midnight.'
The office is a tense place of work for 'Steve' with one of his bosses whos wife he'd slept with looking for an excuse to dump
him out.
'Steve' sets about investigating the six-year old crime to give himself a background to the case before writing the story, he
soon discovers anomalies in the evidence, could it be that 'Frank Beechum' is in fact an innocent man.
He discovers the evidence of the key-witness to be doubtful,  and after visiting the prison becomes even more convinced
that a miscarriage of justice is about to take place.
'Steve' checks out the findings of colleague 'Michelle' who had earlier been writing the story he was now working on but
had died the night before in a car-smash, could her notes uncover a vital lead ?
He draws a blank seemingly, now with time ticking away all seems lost, could there be one last clue to change the course of
events ? ...or is it quite simply too late.
Saw this one a while back, forgotten just how good it really is.
The film has plenty of tension along with some deeply emotional moments along the way.
This is 'Clint Eastwood'at his very best.

again extremely well Directed by Clint eastwood
excellent cast, Great performances aswell by Isaiah washington & James woods
definitely on Clint eastwood's list as one of his best Directed films
anyway Warner bros has decided to release True crime on blu-ray finally
but spent not much effort doing it i tell you
again all warners has done which is typical of them
is upgrade the picture quality with a new HD transfer in 1:85:1 ratio, the back cover ratio says 1:77:1, that's Dead wrong
the screens ratio is 1:85:1 same as the old dvd
plus a new 5.1 master audio mix so the picture & sound quality have been upgraded from the very old dvd version
and the new transfer does look excellent, very nice sharp & clear quality much better quality than the old Digital remaster
so warners have made the effort with the picture & sound which is to be expected
but that's all they have done
in terms of extras, WB have only recycled the extras from the old dvd version that's all
which are the 2 making of featurettes, Diana krall music video and the usual Theatrical trailer
would've been Great to get new interview with Clint eastwood about Directing True crime
but ofcourse warners did not bother
so is this new blu-ray worth buying, definitely worth upgrading to this new blu-ray
much better 1080p HD transfer than the very old dvd version
5 stars for the film, 3 stars for this new blu-ray based on new HD transfer & 5.1 master mix
but the extras have been recycled",1461974400,,1507,4.523809523809524

He feels that he has a nose for a story. Now, he has a job with a small newspaper and is sleeping with his boss wife who tells her husband about the affair. He is ignoring his wife and daughter.
A reporter who was supposed to interview a man on death row is killed in an accident and he is given the assignment. The man will be executed in twelve hours for murdering a pregnant woman some half dozen years ago. He is certain that the man is innocent and despite the opposition of many who think he is wrong, he tries to prove the man innocent.

Enjoyed the entire film except for the homeless man character.  The over-the-top vulgarity was unnecessary and lent nothing to the story other than telling the viewer that reporter Everett was acquainted with a foul-mouthed manbig whoop.

There were a lot of gut-wrenching, sad scenes, but funny moments, too.

The film didn't change my pro-death penalty view.  It did have a sledge-hammer impact, though.  Persons investigating a crime and/or charging a person with a crime have a greater responsibility than the average worker.  In other words, if you're involved with law enforcement or the legal system, you must perform your job better than the rest of usthats big time stress.  Kudos to the men & women who can handle those types of jobs; they must be pretty special folks.

It makes one wonder how many Wardens of prison life, find themselves wondering if a prisoner is truly guilty of their crime.  The laws don't always get it right.

Not one of my favorite movies of his, but it did make me feel a lot of emotions.  Isaiah Washington was superb.  I wonder how he felt being in a position that some have actually endured before actually dying.  The tight space was chilling enough.  Being strapped down like an animal.  A condemned prisoner watching others watch their execution as though it's a performance for their entertainment.  Of course, it's actually real.

For those who believe in the death penalty, this should definitely give one something to think about.",1405296000,,846,4.76551724137931

1213601,5,B00000G0CS,"This picture has the simple whodunit style of a murder mystery that I've always enjoyed, along with quite the ticking clock.  Clint Eastwood goes above and beyond when his journalist character is assigned to simply interview a Death Row inmate, played by Isaiah Washington.  Initially driven by simple curiosity, he goes to the scene of the crime to get some background information.  It is then that he finds genuine inconsistencies in what happened a few years back.  With less than a day to prove that an innocent man is about to be executed, he gives it his all to find what he needs to save the man's life.  Some might say that it's rather far-fetched as to how the reporter determined the condemned man might be innocent...really, no one previously considered things like the store's layout being different then described?  I would agree were it not for the 140+ real-life individuals who were sent to Death Row and later exonerated.  Unfortunately, I buy the circumstances in this film and they were pretty interesting circumstances.  While this film may not be able to hold up in comparison to films like Dead Man Walking or The Green Mile, it's still a film worth watching.  Clint Eastwood is lively throughout as the alcoholic reporter trying to do the right thing.  I did think that Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton, who played the condemned man's wife, were a bit bland.  It's possible that the weight of the situation overcame them, but shouldn't there be some emotion throughout this grim process?  And did they have to kill Mary McCormack's character off so quickly?  Yes, it's what happened in the book, but its Mary McCormack...give her just a few more lines.  This is a fine film to watch, especially if you liked the book it was based on.

Raunchy ol' Eastwood sets a hilarious scene of confrontation with fellow police buddies; James Woods, Clint, and a very young Denis Leary (holding his own with the big-timers).  That scene is worth the price of admission :) ! Hopefully the out-takes will be included in future revisions/releases (please?)

Of course, the 'old technology' (Phones/computers/cars) are a gift in themselves.

One forgets the range Clint is capable of, until you view some of his older films.  He is much deeper than ""Dirty Harry"".

Of course, human-interest stories are just not what Everett does, so he immediately sets about investigating the condemned man's guilt or innocence, especially as a couple of facts emerge by accident early on in the day that make him suspicious about the verdict. The editor-in-chief Alan Mann (James Woods) has some sympathy with Everett so allows him his head to investigate. A new possible suspect emerges, so it's a race against the clock to save someone who appears to be innocent: but we don't know whether or not the film is an anti-capital punishment story in which an innocent man dies - or is he guilty as a visiting priest coerces a confession from Beechum? It's a tense thriller, very well acted by the principals, and we don't know the outcome till the very end of the movie.",1349222400,,1069,4.8791208791208796

The central character played here by a 68 year old Eastwood,is just such a man. Eastwood is ably backed by a great supporting cast;Eastwood has had the good fortune and wherewithal to surround himself with talented folks throughout his long and distinguished career. Isaiah Washington is on hand as the criminal wrongfully convicted and on death row,James Wood is the head of the newspaper where he works and Denis Leary is Eastwood's immediate boss.
The plot finds Eastwood as a womanizing,drinking newspaperman who has been shipped from New York to Oakland,California. Some claim he hounded the NYC mayor who got him ousted. We later learn it was his womanizing that actually did the trick,so to speak. As the film opens he sits beside a 23 year fellow reporter and makes a few propositions towards her which she nicely rejects and leaves. On the way home she is killed in a car accident at,like the Jan and Dean song,Dead Man's Curve. Eastwood however arrives to work late the next morning,after having slept with the wife of his immediate boss Leary.
He is given the bad news and is told to take  her place in finishing up a story she had been given regarding a death row inmate sentenced to die that very night. Right off the bat Eastwood starts asking questions about the murder the man on death row committed,but his editors don't want a holy crusade,just an interest piece. Off he goes,but he has to take his young daughter to the zoo first. It's a whirlwind tour,literally,and Eastwood's running while his daughter is in a stroller,ends up with a spill onto the pavement. Eastwood and daughter arrive back home,but find the wife in a terrible mood after she sees what has happened. The door is slammed and Eastwood is off to interview a prime witness in the original case.
The interview doesn't go as the interviewee quite expects,as Eastwood just can't get around his story. They part but things are bugging him about this case and the clock is ticking. He goes to the deceased reporters home to get info there,but little is gleaned. However he does discover there was someone else at the scene who fled,just before the one who was accused entered the scene. He tracks down that person through his grandmother,only to find he has been deceased three years. Eastwood cannot get his editors,nor the authorities to run with his suspicions. Later in the evening Eastwood sits at home with his wife,who gives him back their wedding ring,sobbing all the while. Eastwood returns to his local watering hole and while sitting there spins his wife's ring. At that moment he gets a flash that a locket the deceased person wore,a gift from her father,was not there at the crime scene. He recalls the grandmother clutching what appears to be the same locket when Eastwood last talked with her.
Eastwood dashes to grandmothers house and before long both are on the road to the Governors mansion to get a stay of execution. Will they make it in time,as the first vile of solution has already entered the prisoners body and the second is starting? The scene switches to Christmas time and Eastwood is in a gift store buying some presents and chatting up the sales rep(a cameo by Lucy Liu!).Outside he stops and when he looks up there is a family of three walking away from another store. The film ends as Diana Krall's haunting song""Should I Care"" kicks in. Mr Eastwood has always been savvy when it comes to jazz,and Krall's career was just starting to break at this time when he included this video in his film. It was a great boost for her,to be sure.
What a wonderfully crafted piece of film making this was. Everything from the editing to the camera work,to the writing to the acting,all falls seamlessly into focus,bit by bit. Eastwood I find can be like a chef,throwing in ingredients,pieces at a time,stirring for awhile,then throwing in some more and stirring again. This film,like many of his other top end ones,are layered;each character,with their own back story,adding to the over all texture of what we see on screen. Until in the end everything falls neatly into place,and you have partaken of something rich and full of taste. True Crime is that kind of movie and more. It is serious,has pathos,drama,then at a moments notice he throws in a bit of humour to lighten the visual load,then it is back to the core again.
This hasn't anything to do with True Crime but I have followed Mr Eastwood's career since the late 60s. I had seen his work on TV and his spaghetti westerns,but Hang em High and Coogan's Bluff really caught my attention back then,as if to say""here's someone special,keep an eye on this guy"".After that I've been in his corner ever since and watching him grow as an actor and film maker year by year. I think there isn't an Eastwood film I have not seen;some I like more than others,but the ones I was never too fond of,I still could respect for the thinking behind them. He put out stuff the public loved and the critics,for the most part,reviled. He has finally gotten the respect of critics,he so deserves,but it took him years to get it. However,I don't know Mr Eastwood personally,but if he and I were sitting here yakking on about Hollywood and his career,I suspect that he might say the only respect he ever wanted was that of the publics. And That,he never lost. Thank you Mr Eastwood for your long lasting contribution to MY world of entertainment,and may there be many more!
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include two featurettes,the trailer and the musical video for Krall's ""Why Should I Care?"".A classy touch to a classy film.
All in all a highly recommended Eastwood jaunt into the realm of the executing of inmates. Eastwood takes neither position,if there indeed is one,but instead let's you be the judge.",1348099200,,6040,4.763358778625954

The film follows a womanizing older man who is a recovering alcoholic(Eastwood). It's a little bizarre to see Eastwood in this role as he is a little past his prime to be playing this philandering reporter, but he handles it fairly well. The story moves along at a good pace and the plot involving a man on death row is engaging.

1213827,5,B00000G0CS,"We turned on True Crime as part of a project to watch all the films of screenwriter Larry Gross, and this one turned out to be a gem.  Primarily a showcase for Clint Eastwood, the film has a hypnotic power that sees us through some rocky shoals.  Mostly, the director has a problem with his star actor--he's too old to play the part, and at first it's disconcerting to see him canoodling in a quiet Oakland bar with a fellow reporter Mary McCormick.  The film says she's 23 (though I must say she looks older), but he must be 70 and we start doing all kinds of subtraction in our head.  At heart the movie is a study of a man falling apart, losing everything the good old fashioned Richard Yates way, and the conceit of the movie is that it all takes place within that Aristotelian framework of 24 hours (plus a little epilogue that must take place several months after the main course of the plot, for it's Christmastime, and Clint is Santa).

Oakland never looked so good or so bad, and I doubt that Eastwood ever assembled a better cast of actors all the way around.  Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton are both magical in parts that fall outside their usual acting range--here they're Christians struggling through his final hours on Death Row, with Michael McKean as an officious chaplain.  In the outside world Clint is cheating, smoking up a storm, cuckolding his boss, fooling women who see through him.  Chief among them is Diane Venora as his long -suffering wife.  Once again Venora proves that she has the dark acting chops that should have landed her starring parts in every Cassavetes movie ever made: she actually looks as if her suffering is not going to be wiped off when the camera's aren't rolling. I think she must still be crying somewhere, helplessly, over Clint's roving eye.  That Venora hasn't the Oscar nods of, say, Meryl Streep, is the real ""true crime"" here",1239148800,,1891,4.584569732937686

I thought it had a great storyline and wasn't at all predictable. (You figure it will be a 50/50 chance of how it ends and if THAT makes it predictable, then I suppose it was).

Clint is remarkable.  I miss his Western films, but I'm also glad that he's showing us a different side of him.

A cop trying to save a family man from dying.  Throughout the entire film, Clint has his audience wrapped around his finger.  Trying to piece together what really happened. It goes to show you that the truth has no boundaries, and desperate times require quick thinking.  Clint wanted us to think that the inevitable will happen.  But he portrayed his role as a caring citizen willing to risk his job and life in believing something that everyone ruled out...the ""real"" truth.

Small details do make a difference and boy in today's age...people rarely care.  Clint couldn't sleep at night knowing what had to be done or at least knowing he ""really"" tried doing the right thing.

If we as people in a civilized society can't get passed what their next door neighbor's skin is, how are we going to survive as morally descent human beings?  This film portrayed the true nature of the true crime that almost sent Clint and Isaiah to death...",1163030400,,1097,4.661458333333333

Unfortunately the script is not up to the story line--the dialogue is corny and false.  Several of the scenes calculated to be gutsy and comical come off as silly.  James Woods chews the scenery.  Not Clint's best but worth a look.",1143331200,4,557,4.8
1213876,4,B00000G0CS,"Clint Eastwood's 1999 release, True Crime, was based on an Andrew Klavan novel and filmed in a style that reminds me of movies made in the late 70's or 80's.  As I watched the first few minutes, my first thought was that poor Clint was to old to portray the part of Steve Everett and this movie had been a waste of money.  At first, it actually kind of ""creeped me out"" watching him come on to the beautiful young women in the movie, but you cannot always judge the movie by your first impressions.  Steve Everett is a cheating husband, a horrible father, a recovering alcoholic, and a womanizer, but he is, first and foremost, a newspaper reporter with a ""nose"" for the truth.  His boss, Bob Findley (Denis Leary), assigns him to cover an execution as a human-interest story.  Bob has a hard time working with Steve, knowing that Steve has been sleeping with his wife, and struggles to maintain a professional office relationship.  Steve has a hunch that Frank Beechum (Isaiah Washington), a black man convicted of the murder of a pregnant white girl, is innocent, but only has one day to come up with evidence before the execution takes place as scheduled.  The plot to this movie is predictable and has been done in other movies many times, but Clint Eastwood's skill as a director turns this otherwise ""dog"" into a suspenseful thrill ride.  The performances of Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton are precise and moving.  James Woods is hilarious and Francesca Fisher Eastwood, Clint Eastwood's daughter in real life, is adorable.  Michael Jeter, Michael McKean, Bernard Hill, and Diane Venora also give great performances and help make True Crime a very good movie that is definitely worth 127 minutes of your time.  Oh, and about my first impressions, I was wrong, Clint is not too old for the part or the beautiful young women.  Clint is still number one.",1081036800,,1866,4.707692307692308
1213877,5,B00000G0CS,"Another great Eastwood directed film with terrific performances by everyone in the cast especially (i.e. Isaiah Washington, Lisa Gay Hamilton and James Woods).  Eastwood is one of my favorite directors ever.  If you are in any way familiar with an old radio show called ""Nightbeat"" this film is very similiar.  This one has a very suspenseful ending.",1075420800,6,350,5.105263157894737
1213878,5,B00000G0CS,"Okay, let's get two sore points out of the way:  Yes, Clint is really a little too old for the leading role, especially in pairing him with such young ladies; and yes, James Woods goes way over top in his cartoonish role as Alan, the editor in chief.  But, aside from that TRUE CRIME is an astounding work for the director Eastwood.  The real stars of the picture, however, are Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton.  As the doomed but innocent Frank Beecham, Washington controls his performance, making him both heartbreakingly real.  No overacting here.  He uses his face, his body, his voice to convey the hopelessness and fear of his impending execution for a crime he did commit.  Hamilton as his wife, Bonnie, has a very demanding role, and her grip on this character is unbelievably subtle and intense.  Some real tear-jerking scenes in this one.  Hard to believe Washington and Hamilton were overlooked at Oscar time.  Denis Leary is exceptionally good as Eastwood's boss who finds out his wife is sleeping with Eastwood.  Leary could have taken this over the top, but he again controls the anguish, jealousy (both professionally and personally), and doesn't resort to familiar tactics.  Bernard Hill as the warden, Michael Jeter as a key witness, and Michael McKean as a really scuzzy minister also do well.
Also, the lovely song voiced by Diana Krall, should have made it to the Oscar nominations too!  Her voice reflects the hopelessness and despair of the film's script.  The writers should also be commended for its faithfulness to Andrew Klavin's excellent novel.

This movie gives you cheating wives, cheating husbands, irresponsible fathers, paper thin plot, superficial characters, and boring dialog. I totally lost my respect for Clint Eastwood after viewing this - and ""Unforgiven"" is one of my all time favorite films! How can a person be so inconsistent?",1061683200,7,549,4.89247311827957
1213880,5,B00000G0CS,"Once i said I would watch any movie directed by Clint Eastwood, no matter genre, cast or plot. I maintain it. Eastwood has reached a point of his career where he has no longer to prove that he is good as his job. His critical success with ""Unforgiven"" and his still-alive popularity have converted him in one of the greatest film directors of all-time and -probably- one of the last living classics.
The important thing in this movie it is not the so-called plot. It is deliberately unbelievable and stereotypical: a convict waiting for his execution and the investigation which may or may not result in stopping the execution, literaly, on the nick of time (Eastwood's character, Everett, starts investigating the very same day of the execution). This thriller plot is deliberately kept as much time as possible in a second term, while Eastwood focuses in what is the main interest of the movie, character description.
During a great deal of the movie, the plot grows in function of the characters and their psychology. The important thing is not that an investigation is on the way, but what the said investigation reveals of the characters. Of Everett it reveals that he is, more than ever, an outsider, and that the main reason of his acts are to prove that he was right and all the rest were wrong, Of Everett's superiors, it reveals their mean -though they are conveniently humanised- thinking, it explores the problems of the convict's family, etc, etc.
Add one of Eastwood's best directing skills -absolutely not a spare shot during the two hours of the movie-, a joyful sense of humour, wonderful performances by the whole cast, nice touches of drama and satire, sharp dialogue and one of the most thrilling climaxes I have ever seen.
I don't care if it could be more thrilling, I don't care if the plot is schematic (it is deliberate) and I don't care if Eastwood has more critically aclaimed films. If not only to watch Eastwood at work again and succeed with style, I am definitely watching this again.",1019433600,4,2014,4.757142857142857
1213881,3,B00000G0CS,"Clint Eastwood has been a star for thirty-five years. He is also a good composer and a respected director. In 1993, he won the Oscar for Best Director for Unforgiven, which also won Best Picture. Now nearly seventy, his movies since then have reflected a more reflective, but still sure, pacing and tone. True Crime, then, is not the action-adventure picture it was merchandised as.
Eastwood plays Steve Everett, a hard-living, womanizing reporter. He used to have a great career in New York City, but he blew it. Now he works for The Oakland Tribune in California, where his job, like the rest of his life, is perilously close to coming apart. Steve is a brilliant and complex character, and Eastwood gives a fine performance. Steve is a sort of Everyman of modern American society. He has lived his life without much continuity, and his relationships have been the shallow sort typical of our times. Now his one gift, which he calls following his hunches, is beginning to fail him. His lifestyle leaves him with no one to save him.
One day another reporter is in an auto accident, and Steve is assigned to take over the story of an execution, which is to take place that night. The editor wants an interview with the condemned man for a human interest story. Steve, though, is of the old school and is always looking for a news story. After some research, his hunch is that his subject is probably innocent of the crime. Of course, there is little time for Steve to prove his theory, and this is what gives True Crimes its tension.
The condemned is Frank Beecham [Isiah Washington], who has always claimed he did not kill a college coed over a $96 debt six years before. Almost half the movie takes place inside the prison, where we see Frank's grim last hours, which include a heart-wrenching visit from his wife and young daughter. There is a parallel here because Steve is estranged -- or nearly so -- from his wife. They also have a young daughter. We see that both characters are basically good, but got into their present predicaments through past behavior. Just as no one believes Frank is innocent, Steve's wife and coworkers do not believe him when he says he can change.
There are elements in True Crime which do not ring true, although they do not ruin the movie. They make it good rather than great. Eastwood's career has been primarily built on characters who are manly loners. Handsome though he is, he's rarely been believable as a romantic lead. Age has not been as kind to him as it has to Sean Connery and Harrison Ford, and the easy with which many women fall for him in the film is hard to swallow. Also, there is a wild chase scene at the end of the picture, which is at odds with the tempo of the overall effort. It's almost as if Eastwood felt obligated to revert to his former image for the sake of his fans.
On the whole, True Crime is interesting and thought-provoking. With its sultry jazz score and its emphasis on characters, it makes for decent, but not riviting, entertainment.",1016755200,,3010,4.575925925925926

1213923,4,B00000G0CS,"I like Clint Eastwood, and wanted to see this video even though the reviews had been lukewarm at best.  However, I found myself relaxing and getting into the story although the suspense was non-existent, the story full of cliches, and the casting weak.  Eastwood plays a reporter who saves a black inmate (Isiah Washington) from death row.  From the beginning the inmate is portrayed in a sympathetic fashion, as is his wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and young daughter visit him on the day of the execution.  There are a lot of interesting details about how an execution is carried out and the warden as well as the prison guards are portrayed as real human beings with internal conflicts of their own.
Eastwood was born in 1930, but this role as a womanizing reporter who beds young women should have been played by a younger man.  James Woods is the newspaper editor and the two of them exchange bawdy one-liners that seem more suited to adolescents than to grown men.  There are a few scenes where Eastwood takes his young daughter to the zoo.  She's about 5 years old, and I remember thinking that he is much to old to play the father.  However, I later found out that the little girl cast in the role actually is his real-life daughter.  But real life does not equal a good movie.
In spite of these many faults I liked the movie.  Why?  Maybe because I always yearned to be a journalist myself.  Maybe because I like Eastwood's strong presence, although I do not now nor did I ever find him sexy.  Maybe, because in spite of the lack of suspense, I found the tempo and cadence of the film relaxing.  There are a lot of reasons to watch a video.  One is to leave the world behind for a little while and let yourself get caught up in a story.  This is a story that's been told before.  And will be told again.  It is the story of the underdog (the reporter) whose life is a mess, and through this good deed, redeems himself and achieves reward and recognition.

The movie has a lot of big names in  the movie including Clint Eastwood, who produced and directed this movie,  Dennis Leary, and etc. Happened to see Absolute Power, directed by  Eastwood, but this movie is a much superior film. Eastwood definitely  redeemed himself in this one.  So go watch this great film.",967852800,26,788,4.375
1213928,4,B00000G0CS,"When a jaded reporter gets an eleventh hour assignment to witness an  execution at San Quentin, it turns into a personal quest for justice as he  spends the last hours of the convicted man's life in a last-ditch effort to  get to the truth of the case.  ""True Crime,"" directed by and starring Clint  Eastwood, is a taut thriller that goes to the wire as Steve Everett  (Eastwood), a journalist and recovering alcoholic, tries to find out what  really happened that fateful day when Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington)  entered a convenience store to buy a bottle of steak sauce and wound up  being convicted of murdering the store clerk.  It's not a campaign born  entirely of compassion, however; Everett has had a checkered career that  has taken him to the top of his profession, only to have his own errors of  judgment (attributed to the bottle) precipitate a swift decline that has  ensconced him in a job at a large paper in the Bay area of Northern  California writing personality pieces and sidebar profiles.  He's not a man  of tremendously high ideals or great conviction, and his moral character is  somewhat ambiguous, but he demands one thing from himself and everyone else  when it comes to reporting a story:  The truth.  In that he is adamant, and  he pursues it without compromise using the one tool in his personal arsenal  that has never (when he is sober) failed him, his ""nose"" for news, that  innate sense that unfailingly leads him to that which he is seeking.  In  the case of Frank Beachum, Everett's nose tells him he is innocent; but  he's only got a few hours to prove it.  And it's been awhile since his  ""nose"" has been put to the test; the last time turned into a debacle that  cost him his reputation.  This time, not only his job,  but a man's life is  on the line.  And the clock is ticking.  Behind the camera, Eastwood is  a master storyteller; he exacts winning performances from his actors,  delivers his movies with a deliberate pace and cadence, and knows how to  keep the tension on the edge right up to the very end.  And this film is no  exception.  As an actor, he's reached a maturity that lends itself  perfectly to characters like Everett, imbuing him with a  been-there-done-that countenance, from the expressive lines in his face to  the way he carries himself physically, that not only makes him an  interesting (if not entirely sympathetic ) character, but adds nuance and  credibility to his overall performance.  Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton  (Bonnie Beachum) also give excellent, emotionally stirring performances  that anchor this story of a desperate family that finds an unlikely  champion in Everett, in whom their only hope for justice and survival lies.  In a terrific supporting role, James Woods plays Alan Mann, the editor for  whom Everett works; it's a dynamic performance that produces some great and  memorable scenes between his character and Eastwood.  Denis Leary is also  outstanding as Bob Findley, Everett's boss, and he turns in a subtle,  understated performance that works as a perfect counterpoint to the  characters of Everett and Mann.  Things really ignite when the three of  them are in a scene together.  Also memorable in supporting roles are  Diane Venora (Barbara Everett), Bernard Hill (Warden Plunkitt), Michael  McKean (Reverend Shillerman), Michael Jeter (Dale Porterhouse) and Mary  McCormack (Michelle).  Be advised, ""True Crime"" is a movie that will put  you through your paces.  From the beginning, you realize that it's highly  unlikely that Everett will succeed; there just isn't enough time.  But you  also know that ""it ain't over `till it's over,"" so you hang on to that slim  thread of hope, and through that you are readily able to relate to  Beachum's situation.  And it makes you realize that if hope is all you  have, at least it's better than nothing.  After all, sometimes in the end,  it all pans out for the better.",967852800,8,3925,4.817220543806647
1213929,4,B00000G0CS,"Great movie!  It was suspenseful.  The name true crime was so fitting.  You read about men sitting on death row and they're innocent.  Steve (Clint  Eastwood) having the affair with his bosses wife, that really happens..  Sound track featuring Johnny Hartman was perfect.",962755200,,271,5.186046511627907
1213930,4,B00000G0CS,"I agree with reveiwer Dan40 about the two best scenes of the film.  I was going to mention the Eastwood/Wood battle of the wits as MY favorite.  I haven't seen comedic timing like that in a long time.  I laughed for a half  an hour...one joke being added to my own ""repetoir"".  Overall, it  was well acted and suspenseful enough to keep you watching from start to  finish with no ""potty breaks"", and it was nice to see that the  good guy sometimes does win (this isn't necessarily in reference only to  the man on death row either).  The cast is great and Eastwood did a good  job directing it , in my opinion.  Don't skip over it like I nearly did  because of box office feedback.",957139200,2,681,4.267716535433071
1213931,5,B00000G0CS,"At least two scenes of TRUE CRIME should stay in my memory for a very long time : the visit at the zoo with Clint Eastwood shouting ""Speed Zoo"" and ""We're going fast"" while pushing his daughter on  wheels and the scene involving Clint and James Woods for a conversation  about women, ethics and capital punishment : two great actors for a moment  of pure pleasure.
At first, TRUE CRIME could be considered as another  movie about capital punishment. Well filmed, with a good rythm and  convincing actors, this movie is the perfect movie to rent. But take a  second look at TRUE CRIME and you won't be disappointed. This movie can be  seen one, two or three times, it will still unveil a lot of goodies. One  can admire how Clint Eastwood compares with subtlety the destiny of Steve  Everett and Frank Beechum by using descriptions of similar situations : for  example, the two little girls harassing their fathers with multiple demands  at a crucial moment. Let's also observe how Clint uses a clever editing to  pass from Beechum's cell to Clint's scenes : cigarettes, paintings (the  green pastures) for instance are themes that bind the two destinies.
I  strongly recommend this film which is another masterpiece in the  exceptional directorial career of Clint Eastwood. Sound and images perfect  for me with above-averages extra-features.
A DVD for your library. At  least, I hope so !",956880000,45,1389,4.817796610169491

It was not at all fluid in telling the story and lost my interest in several places, which is unusual for a Clint Eastwood vehicle. I am not at all sorry I watched the movie, but it could have been so much better than it was. It just wasn't that engaging due to poor execution of storyline.",1520640000,,417,4.225
