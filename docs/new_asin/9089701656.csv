1172687,5,9089701656,"This is a beautiful butterfly and flower DVD. I have many Tony Helsloot videos and it's really hard to choose which one I like the best - he has many varieties of subject matter. As always, the photography is stunning - this video is SO relaxing - I absolutely love it - and since I love butterflies too, it makes it even better than simply beautiful flowers. Another great job!",1387065600,,378,4.414285714285715
1172688,5,9089701656,"This DVD is an amazing collection of the natural sights and sounds that you might find walking in some of the worlds most beautiful gardens.  If you love the experience of visiting botanical gardens or if you just need something to help you relax and reduce stress, then this DVD is the perfect choice for you.
 Much more than simply a walk in a garden, Tropical Gardens and Butterflies allows you to become a quiet observer as the delicate beauty of nature unfolds around you.  You focus up close on tropical plants and flowers as gorgeous butterflies and dragonflies alight on the leaves and the flower petals, you experience the magnificence of awesome waterfalls, and you relax as perfectly themed piano music and the sounds of nature gently wash away your stress.
 This is a must-have DVD for inviting friends over, a romantic evening, doctor or dentists offices, or just unwinding after a long day of work.  The playback options make it easy to put it in the DVD player and leave it on; no need to keep fiddling with the remote control.  Reasonably priced and professionally produced.  Highly recommended.",1386979200,10,1111,4.815789473684211

1172706,5,9089701656,Absolutely brilliant! I used this DVD for the first time last Thursday as a visual for my elderly dementia residents while the piano lady was playing. It kept their attention with all the beautiful butterflies and flowers. It is great on its own to listen to or just for visual. Will get many hours of use from this great DVD.

It shows beautiful pictures of orchids, fountains, waterfalls and lotus ponds with soothing piano music, where you can relax wonderfully from everyday life. The flowers are shown with their gorgeous colors in a close-up view, so you can see every detail. Watching the waterfalls and fountains with the sparkling water is very soothing.

1172729,5,9089701656,"I bought Rain, Cascades, one about undersea life, and this DVD from the Ambient collection. Ambient DVD's were recommended by the storekeeper in the healthy living store at my healthcare provider's office. My favorites things about them are: they will play without stopping indefinitely. They just keep re-looping, so I don't have to start them again. Second, the menus on the DVD's allows me all kinds of flexibility; I can play just the nature sounds, or just beautiful, relaxing music, or both, for example. Add to that the impeccable quality of the images themselves, and I could play these videos for hours. Which is why I do :-).",1422403200,14,635,4.888888888888889

1172733,5,9089701656,"I seem to gravitate towards the relaxation DVDs that feature relaxing piano music with beautiful scenes of nature and this DVD exactly fits that criteria for me.  It's slow paced - fading from one scene to another.  It's filmed in HD so everything is crisp and vibrant - I wanted to smell the flowers!  I love the faded backgrounds throughout section 1 and 2 - it draws attention to the insect or flower and it gives you a chance to really study it.  Images of butterflies, dragonflies, birds, beautiful orchids, ferns, water, light, waterfalls, mist, greenery, rain - are all the images that you will be able to take in.  I watched this DVD on an evening when it was 10 degrees outside with snow on the ground and it was so refreshing to be in a tropical paradise for a little while and escape the cold!  In Soothing Scenes 1 - there are crickets, birds and waterfalls.  It is a daytime jungle experience.  My husband said the sounds reminded him of when he was in some of the more tropical parts of Australia - it was that realistic.  Soothing Scenes 2 starts with a lush garden and waterfall - just beautiful!  In the 3rd segment - I was amazed at being able to study the details in a single leaf.  In my opinion, you can't go wrong with this DVD.  The piano music is by Simon Daum.  You have your choice of piano music or the natural sounds.  I like having that choice and can play according to my mood.  Another beautiful DVD from The Ambient Collection!",1418169600,2,1459,4.391791044776119

1172752,4,9089701656,"Since purchasing the ""Tropical Aquarium"" by Isis Visuals, I checked out the other products and purchased three more so that I could have a variety to choose from.  Tropical Gardens and Butterflies was one.  Another was ""Rain"" and another was ""The Living Ocean"".  I like to read having the visuals and music and nature sounds in the background.  Isis Visual products are well done.  The music is non-intrusive which makes it great to have in the background for meditating, reading and even for having a group of people over to provide ambiance.  Also, I like the fact you have a choice to have nature sounds, music or both as the video loops.  Thank you Tony Helsloot for a quality product.

I ordered another Tropical Garden dvd because my sister loved what she saw.  I received the dvd today and am a little puzzled.  The second dvd says it has 80 min  My original one says it has 120 min run time.  I wonder why they shortened it.  Since I am giving the second one as a gift, I haven't yet seen it.
