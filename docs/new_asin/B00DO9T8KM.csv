8595324,4,B00DO9T8KM,"The 4 instead of 5 star rating is only because the film suffers from noticeable deterioration at points. That said, buyers of pristine quality, beware. All others rejoice! We have here a wonderful Wally Wales starring feature complete with a newly added musical score by Jack Hardy that fits each scene to a tee, no scratchy old time ill-fitting 78s providing the background music. Hardy's score really enhances the viewing pleasure, especially during the two outstanding chase sequences; Wally rescuing a child in a runaway buckboard and the climatic rounding up of the outlaw gang at the conclusion. Slim Whitaker plays the boss heavy here. When sound & the 30s came in he was usually regulated to one of the gang.
Wally, released from prison after two years for a crime he did not commit, comes home to Ma only to find out that the ranch has been lost to the ones who framed him. In a pretty standard plot, Wally overcomes all odds, defeats the bad guys and wins back his ranch and the sheriff's daughter. But it's not really the plot that matters as much here as it's the execution of those events and Wally's overall charm and easygoing likableness.
Filmed in Julian, California local historian David Lewis provides us with some important insight as well as then and now photo comparisons. A lot of Julian has remained the same over the years and the photo sequence is a nice bonus touch to a very enjoyable silent Western.
Historically significant glimpse into the past, when such location filming was really not all that far removed from the real West, despite the use of automobiles on dusty unpaved roads and coca cola advertising on the grocery store. A real treat, especially for those who can appreciate such a glimpse into a long forgotten era when cowboys meant so much to popular entertainment and projected life values onto impressionable youths...Highly recommended.",1435622400,,1883,4.869158878504673
