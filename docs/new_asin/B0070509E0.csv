Played this DVD like 10 times, the kids loved it. They were evening acting out the scenes by end of the trip.

I wish BAPS produces a series out of this. Entertainment and traditional values go well together.

Great DVD. Highly recommend this DVD.

4 stars because there is always room for improvement.",1339459200,,408,4.472972972972973
8588201,5,B0070509E0,"I remember being stopped in my tracks when I first saw the trailer of Ghanshyam and the Storm of Evil. Although I'm no longer a kid, I really enjoyed watching this child-focused film with my younger siblings. The colors and characters are vibrant, the story line is catchy and full of action, and I remained captivated throughout the entire film. It was almost like experiencing a comic book come to life. In my opinion, this film is great for all ages.",1331596800,,453,4.604938271604938

8588203,5,B0070509E0,"I bought this DVD for my nephew (age five), but I think we both enjoyed it equally. It is in both English and Hindi, which is great for many audiences. Being Hindu in America, I am always happy to get a chance to increase my nephew's exposure to our our faith and culture. This film is a great solution.  It both entertained and taught him about  Hinduism in an interesting way. The film presented important morals through a lovely set of characters. Also, I must add that the storyline can be surprisingly suspenseful at times. Definitely something that is worth watching either by yourself or with the younger generation.",1329868800,2,623,4.706422018348624

I am thrilled to know that my daughter is learning about her heritage in an age-appropriate way, through a multi-sensory approach. This is great!",1327276800,2,313,4.814814814814815
