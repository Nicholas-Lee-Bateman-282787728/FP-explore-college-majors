8339913,2,B001SK746E,"There are two chapters included on the DVD ""6. Number Theory & Algebra"" and ""9. Probability & Statistics"" which are not included in the workbook--no sample problems, no reviews, no exercises.  The other sections which are included on DVD amd workbook both are well done with clear explanations.  I am disappointed because the instructional set  is not complete and those sections are what my daughter needs the most help with.",1389052800,,426,5.057142857142857
8339914,5,B001SK746E,"Both of our girls really didn't care much for math before we switched to Mastering Essential Math Skills.  Once we made the change, the girls actually liked doing their math lessons because they loved the simple, step-by-step instructions, the review problems, and the 10 problems that came with each lesson.  (They weren't overwhelmed with tons of problems).  In fact, in our homeschool, we moved our 2nd daughter from 5th grade to 7th grade because she was ready for this book; and she has done well!  It really is 20 minutes a day to success!! Thanks Mr. Fisher",1238544000,6,564,4.783505154639175
