I wanted a tape that had chest hair, dolphin shorts and hot men from the 80's,  I didn't know that I could ever find such a tape until I bought Playgirl's Complete Morning Workout, otherwise known as Hunkercize.  The workout is effective and a lot of fun, and the scantily clad Playgirl men really make me not want to skip a workout.  Follow this up with Playgirl's Supertoner, and you've got a toned body and a smile.",1366934400,,498,4.43956043956044
