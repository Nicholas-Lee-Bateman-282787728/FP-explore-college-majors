1908467,5,B0000AOV5X,This is a very underrated movie but excellent nonetheless. No a big budget flick but still just as polished with great acting and a good story. Definitely recommended.,1304812800,,167,5.0
1908468,4,B0000AOV5X,"A seemingly chance encounter with an old lady results in architect Michael Lewis (Andrew McCarthy) developing the ability to see and communicate with dead people. One of the ghosts he sees is that of a little girl who was murdered by a serial killer and Lewis is enlisted to solve her murder so that she can rest in peace.

This movie was shown on Australian television as a lunch time movie (a time-slot not exactly renown for it's high quality entertainment) and I watched it solely because I will watch just about anything that stars Andrew McCarthy, no matter how bad it might be (and a lot of his later films are pretty bad). It, therefore, came as quite a surprise to me when this film turned out to be a pretty good murder mystery that kept me guessing right up until the end. This movie is, in fact, a pilot for a TV series that was never made, and at the end of it, I was genuinely disappointed that this series hadn't been picked up. I really wanted to see more.

This movie was written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, director of such classics as ""Resident Evil"" and ""Alien vs Predator"" (interpret that information whichever way you choose) and has an interesting ""Alice in Wonderland"" theme throughout (which I think is meant to symbolize Lewis's transition into a strange new world, ""down the rabbit hole"", so to speak - whatever it means, I enjoyed spotting the ""Alice"" references). Unfortunately, this film seems to currently be unavailable in the US (it is available on DVD in Australia, however), which is a shame because this is a good film and a cut above your average pilot or made-for-television movie.",1214524800,2,1627,4.626297577854671
1908469,5,B0000AOV5X,LOVED IT!  VERY ENTERTAINING  SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SERIES  LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE.,1206662400,,81,5.076923076923077
1908470,5,B0000AOV5X,"You will totally love this movie, especially if you are an avid Kevin Tighe fan as am I. His supportive role gave great credibility to the movie. The suspense and the mood will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the very end. There are moments that will make you jump out of your chair one minute and have you laughing the next...so get the popcorn ready, turn out the lights, call a friend to come over and watch The Sight and enjoy!",1173657600,7,445,4.126436781609195
1908471,5,B0000AOV5X,"This was obviously a pilot for a TV series that never happened. Pity too, because it leaves many peripheral questions unanswered. It has a very Matrix-esque ending that makes you go, ""huh?"" However, the base mystery is very-well done about an American architect who is lured to England and finds out he has the dubious ""gift"" of speaking to the dead.

The atmosphere is very spooky with plenty of jump-out-of-your-skin moments. There are also a couple of funny moments, but most of it moves along at a fairly quick pace as Michael Lewis must race to stop a serial killer before he strikes again. There's also the disconnect for Michael of not knowing if he's talking to a ghost or a live human. It leaves you guessing to the end as to the killer's identity.

It's too bad that this never went any further. It's obvious the writers had more planned than just a weekly series about an amateur detective who speaks to ghosts.",1143331200,,922,4.615853658536586
1908472,4,B0000AOV5X,"I first saw this movie as a TV program that was interrupted by severe weather, so I lost much of the story line.  After watching the DVD version without interruptions I found it very entertaining and well done.  The casting was really good with the character of Alice Cooper stealing much of the show for me, as children so often do. For those who enjoy this genre, i.e.  supernatural vision drama, this movie works well.  Like much of today's Hollywood production, the chase scenes at the conclusion were somewhat overdone but did not greatly detract from the story.  Being in England set a tone or mood in the movie that could only be achieved there.  Not a great movie, but really good entertainment  -  a movie that can be enjoyed by repeated viewings.",1128556800,,756,4.631578947368421
1908473,5,B0000AOV5X,"THE SIGHT is a made for Fox TV movie directed by visionary director Paul W. S. Anderson, who directed Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil and Event Horizon.  Although it might be tempting to compare this movie to THE SIXTH SENSE, they're really quite different.

Andrew McCarthy, one of the Brat Pack, stars as an architect who is summoned to London to restore an old historic hotel.  While there, he accidentally runs over an elderly woman who has left her hospital and wanders the streets.  This lady (played with fervent tongue in cheek by Honor Blackman - the original Emma Peel and Pussy Galore in Goldfinger---informs McCarthy he is to take over her role as the ""advocate for the dead.""  He is gifted with ""the sight"" you see, so now he is to be the champion for several murdered children who want him to find the serial killer responsible.

McCarthy gets good support from Kevin Tighe, Alexander Armstrong, Amanda Redman, Jessica Oyelowo, and Maurice Roeves.  Even though the plotting is at times ludicrous, Anderson weaves some spooky and atmospheric visuals, and the pace is brisk and involving.  You'll find yourself enjoying it in spite of yourself.",1105401600,11,1153,4.907216494845361
1908474,2,B0000AOV5X,"Useless piece of movie by director Anderson. He apparently used this movie as a laboratory or as a stop-gap between his bigger Hollywood productions like Alien x Predator and Resident Evil 2.

Shot in London, this movie has the merit of bringign Andrew McCarthy back. He's a fine actor who unfortunately dissapeared from the big roles. And he does not have a big role here, but at least it's the main role, and he does a fine job.

The story is pedestrian and perfunctory, but anyway the photography has a certain style.",1097971200,2,520,4.641304347826087
7997748,4,B0000AOV5X,Good movie! Need more of Andrew McCarthy.,1471046400,,41,5.0
7997749,3,B0000AOV5X,"I really like this movie, but have not been able to find it new. Considering this is a used DVD, and that my DVD player is an economy model, I am pleased with the DVD. It only freezes in one spot, where I have to stop, go past that point, and then back up to just past that point. Other than that, the DVD played quite well.",1452556800,,324,3.8507462686567164

7997752,5,B0000AOV5X,"I gave this a five because it is a remake of an older movie that I like and I thought the acting was good and captured the mood well.  McCarthy makes a great bad guy,  I enjoyed it.",1444003200,,181,3.736842105263158
7997753,4,B0000AOV5X,would have made a great series if they followed through,1431648000,,55,4.6
7997754,4,B0000AOV5X,I saw this movie a long time ago and it just stuck in my head.  A good tv movie that has been remembered,1389139200,,104,3.5217391304347827
7997755,5,B0000AOV5X,This movie of an architect who can interact with Spirits is the best of its type.  This well acted ghost story pre-dates Ghost Whisperer and was shot in England. Spirits intrude on the lead character's life needing help to solve their murders. Likeable characters and a very hateable serial killer make this story enjoyable and creepy. There should have been a sequel.,1336435200,,368,4.935483870967742
7997756,5,B0000AOV5X,"This movie was very,very good and also wanted to see Kevin Tighe in it. He used to play in Emergency. The movie keep you on the edge of your seat. Thanks",1319241600,,153,3.967741935483871
7997757,3,B0000AOV5X,I liked this movie. It is a little tame when it comes to paranormal films but I would suggest this to anyone who doesn't understand the meaning of being a Medium.,1318204800,,162,4.258064516129032
