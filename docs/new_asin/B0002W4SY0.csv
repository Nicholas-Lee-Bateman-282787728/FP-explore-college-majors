2128675,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles and Exo Squad are by far the two best animated series to come from America, and amnong the three best ever produced in the world. Why? Because they didn't insult the intelligence of their viewers. They treated kids as capable of dealing with the grit of reality. The good guys weren't perfect and the bad guys weren't pure evil. This was high-quality, high-intensity drama for the Saturday morning crowd, and to be honest, most adults would find it enthralling too. Disney spared no expense when making this series; they got numerous Star Trek alumni to lend their voices, including Jonathan Frakes (Riker/Xanatos), Marina Sirtis (Troi/Demona), Michael Dorn (Worf/Coldstone), Brent Spiner (Data/Puck), Kate Mulgrew (Janeway/Titania), and so on. And let me tell you, Star Trek actors make AWESOME bad guys (don't believe me? Check out Patrick Stewart in  Masterminds).

I've set my TIVO to record reruns of the show on Jetix and I've downloaded probably at least half of all the episodes from Kazaa. Ever since DVD boxsets became popular, I've been waiting for the first season to be put on DVD. Years later, my dream has come true.",1093737600,53,1141,5.031746031746032
2128676,5,B0002W4SY0,"Disney's GARGOYLES is a classic. Despite its toy manufacturer's mandate to appeal to little boys, it was unafraid to take on a broader audience and can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.

GARGOYLES is a show about building relationships despite surface differences. A message its fans have taken to heart. Each year they come together to meet and celebrate the series at The Gathering of Gargoyles. This unique convention will be profiled on the DVD in a 15 minute documentary fimed at the most recent stop in its ""World Tour"" Montreal Canada. Next stop in 2005 Las Vegas Nevada.

An additional feature on the disc will be an audio commentary by Series Co Creators Greg Weisman and Frank Paur and Voice of Goliath Keith David on the 5 part series opener ""Awakening"".",1093478400,12,766,4.7518796992481205
2128677,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles is the greatest thing to happen to animation since the invention of the pencil. This show has something for everyone. Action, comedy, romance, everything you could ask for in entertainment. You can watch it twenty times and still find something new. This is so cutting edge in the field of animation that after you've seen it you'll find yourself wondering if it was real. Just in time for the holiday season, so it'll make a great gift. All my friends are getting one.",1093305600,10,479,4.714285714285714
2128678,5,B0002W4SY0,"Nearly ten years have passed since Gargoyles first aired.  It had a short run, two years, maybe three, quickly thrown aside to make room for ""Power Rangers.""  You may think that the series is forgotten, and that any hope of bringing it back has been lost, but you could not be more wrong.  There are thousands of fans all over the globe, people of all ages and backgrounds, all of whom praise this series for the reality intertwined with fantasy and myth, coupled with excellent characters that almost seemed real, in such a way that the love for the series still blooms and the hope of it returning in some way, shape or form has not been lost.  It holds a special place in people's hearts, and new fans are falling in love with the series through reruns on Toon Disney and ABC Family.

What is it about the show that is still bringing in new fans even though it's been cancelled for EIGHT YEARS?  Well, the story is about creatures who are ""stone by day, warriors by night.""  A thousand years ago, they protected their castle at night, while the humans protected them while they slept.  The humans treated the gargoyles with nothing but disrespect, and the gargoyles were betrayed, shattered in their stone sleep, and the surviving gargoyles (Goliath, Hudson, Brooklyn, Broadway, Lexington, and Bronx) were cursed to sleep in stone until ""the castle rose above the clouds.""  A thousand years passed.  Billionaire David Xanatos learned of the gargoyles, and had the castle moved, stone by stone, to the top of his skyscraper.  The gargoyles awakened in a strange new world and had to learn to adapt if they wanted to survive.

The series deals with subjects such as the consequences of using guns irresponsibly in the episode Deadly Force (the episode that was banned from Toon Disney for a long, long time), revenge, betrayal, death; things you won't find in your average Disney cartoon.  The series itself looks like it was written as a whole; every single episode is part of the continuity and each and every character is important.  The series is not all about drama; there is some comedy here and there, as well as love, understanding, tolerance, and hope.

You may also find yourself recognizing some of the characters' voices, such as: Keith David (Goliath), Ed Asner (Hudson), Bill Faggerbake (Broadway), Thom-Adcox Hernandez (Lexington), Salli Richardson (Elisa), Jonathan Frakes (Xanatos), Marina Sirtis (Demona, Margot Yale), among many others.  The series is so full of talent and you can tell that a lot of love went into this series.

There's a lot more I haven't mentioned here, but there's just too much!  This series truly has everything.  If you've seen this series before, then re-experience the phenomenon that is Gargoyles through DVD.  If you've never seen this series before, I highly recommend the DVD.  It may change your life.  If you're still not convinced, then think of this: if enough people buy this DVD, then we'll get Season 2 and 3, and maybe even new episodes, which is every fan's dream.  Still not convinced?  Well, Disney may consider releasing other animated series (such as Darkwing Duck and TaleSpin) on DVD, as they're ""testing the waters.""  If you're not doing it for Gargoyles, then at least do it for those other shows that you grew up with.

If I have convinced you, then great!  I know you'll enjoy ""Gargoyles.""  If not, then you're truly missing out on one of the greatest series of all time.  Five stars!",1093219200,47,3454,4.7969543147208125
2128679,4,B0002W4SY0,"Others have praised this show, and I'm sure that more will.  This much seems clear: ""Gargoyles"" had its genesis in a creative team who set out to make the animated television show that THEY would want to watch.  The result is a muscular, bold and ambitious series, one featuring many strong and multi-faceted characters, drawing from many sources of inspiration while remaining its own unique and appealing beast.

I'll let the fact that I ordered it IMMEDIATELY say the rest.  (Although I'd also add my not-so-secret wish that interest in this series will lead Disney to make some of their other classic animated television series, such as ""Darkwing Duck"" and ""Talespin,"" available on DVD.)",1093132800,13,691,5.035087719298246
2128680,5,B0002W4SY0,"Ten years ago, ""Gargoyles"" aired on television for the first time, and it forever changed my life.  Finally an animated series with as much depth as any classic novel, great characters who were believable on every level, breathtaking animation, terrific acting.  ""Gargoyles"" had it all, whether you were a fantasy enthusiast, a sci-fi fan, whether you loved noir or Shakespeare, and even figures from ancient mythologies.

Lending their voices to the series were veteran actors such as Keith David, Salli Richardson, Jonathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis, John Rhys-Davies, Ed Asner, Jeff Bennett, Thom Adcox, Bill Faggerbake, Paul Winfield, Tim Curry, David Warner, Sheena Easton, and many, many others.  Behind the scenes had the most dedicated crew you could ever find.  Series Creator Greg Weisman who's passion for the series is still alive and well ten years later and has been a real presence in the fan community, Frank Paur, Michael Reaves, Brynne Chandler, Lydia Marano, Greg Guler.  The care put into the series rivals and exceeds that of most movies.

But most of all, the series inspired a strong fandom that is going strong today, meeting annually at the fan conventions.  Next year they will all be getting together in Las Vegas to celebrate THE NINTH ANNUAL GATHERING OF THE GARGOYLES.

So, buy this DVD and re-experience (or experience for the first time) the first season of this now classic series.  There has never been a series like it before, and will likely never be a series like it again.  Ten years later, the magic is still there.  So, buy it now.  I guarantee you will love it.",1092960000,16,1598,4.940074906367041
2128681,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles is far and away THE best animated series that I have ever seen. The animation quality was excellent. The voice acting was incredible; the characters really came alive thanks to an incredibly talented cast of actors and actresses.

The writing was superb and smart. The stories were steeped in mythology from around the globe. No doubt Joseph Campbell would have liked the series. References to Shakespeare and other classic stories abound.

The stories were character-driven and had arcs over many many episodes; life in the Gargoyles universe didn't simply ""reset"" at the start of the next episode. And no matter what happened, everything was consistent within the universe that had been defined for Gargoyles.

The show dealt with mature themes like gun violence, environmental disaster, and grief over loss of a loved one, but it was always presented in a way that was appealing to both parent and child. Believe me, if the show's writers had beaten its audience over the head with the Morality Bat or otherwise dumbed down the stories, Gargoyles would never have become as popular as it did.

Clearly, if there was ever an animated series (I hate to label this a mere 'cartoon') that had EVERYTHING, Gargoyles was it. And not Disney, nor any other studio, has managed to duplicate this feat since then.",1092960000,23,1316,4.968181818181818
2128682,5,B0002W4SY0,"Without a doubt, the best animated series Disney/Buena Vista TV has created-and one of the best series of all time -  period!  Unleashed to TV in 1994, Gargoyles was a departure from most of the comedy/action series that Disney had created before or since. Although darker, with much more depth in character and story than your average animated series - it will touch you in a way you likely never thought an animated show could ever do before.  Stone gargoyles come to life at night, with an instinct to protect those in need of help - but feared for their appearance.  The mix of mythology, magic, technology, ties with literature, history, drama, action and even romance and weaving it all together into an incredible continuing story of 6 gargoyles and their struggle to find acceptance. Besides the incredible stories Gargoyles offers - the voices that bring the characters to live are an all star cast of actors including Keith David, Ed Asner, John Rhys-Davies, Bill Fagerbakke, Salli Richardson, Tom Wilson, Matt Frewer & Cree Summer.  If you're a Star Trek Fan, the first season includes voices done by Jonathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis, Nichelle Nichols & Michael Dorn (The show's second season brings more voices from the first 4 Trek series into the fold as well).

""Stone By Day, Warriors By Night"" - not only do the Gargoyles come to life, the characters themselves in this series feel very real.  A show which covers life lessons, family values, environmental issues and more without doing it in a preachy, heavy handed way.  An amazing show for kids and equally, if not  more entertaining for adults as well.  As a 38 year old animation fan, I can't say enough about this series.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.  Let's hope season 2 isn't far behind.",1092960000,14,1767,4.814569536423841
2128683,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles was, hands down, one of the best shows to come out of Disney's animated series department. Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gargoyles used the combination of action, drama, unique story telling, character development, and amazing acting to make a masterpiece of a show. It is the story of Gargoyles, creatures who are stone statues by day and come to life at night, which have been ripped from their time in 994, Scotland and thrust into modern day Manhattan. And in this brave new world they not only fight for survival but also understanding and friendship among people who would fear and misjudge them. Featuring an all-star voice cast of Keith David (Chronicles of Riddick), Salli Richardson (Anacondas), Edward Asner (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), John Rhys-Davies (The Lord of the Rings), Bill Fagerbakke (SpongeBob SquarePants), Jonathan Frakes (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Marina Sirtis (Star Trek: The Next Generation), and more; All helping to bring to life a story of life, humanity, and love.",1092960000,10,1015,5.157575757575757
2128684,5,B0002W4SY0,"For those who don't know about Gargoyles, let me explain a bit.  Gargoyles is Disney's first foray into a dramatic series.  The writing, character development, and story development are all PHENOMENAL.  The animation is Disney's usual good stuff, but it's definitely the story and the characters that make this worth getting.  Is it suitable for young children?  Absolutely.  It carries a Y7 rating for fantasy violence, but there are plenty of good lessons to be had in the story lines.  Also be sure to check the fan website at [...] and look for information on how to join us at next year's 9th Annual Gathering of the Gargoyles in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 29, 2005.",1092960000,12,670,4.724137931034483

These were packaged well and in great shape.  I am very glad I could find these well drawn cartoons with great storytelling from the 1990s.

In case you don' know it was a time with a lot of cartoons with better characters and deeper stories than even some movies (not to mention almost all of the cartoons since then!).  Just so you know, I'm not just saying that due to nostalgia either.  =D",1506988800,,539,4.144230769230769
2128694,5,B0002W4SY0,"I've slowly been making my way through a long list of movies and TV shows that were either recommended to me, or are famous/considered classics that, for whatever reason, I never saw them. And back in the day, for the longest time, my family couldn't get the Disney Channel, so shows that were an integral part of other kids' childhoods (like Ducktales, TaleSpin, etc.), I totally missed out on. But thanks to DVD's and the internet, I finally rectified this missed opportunity, and dove into a show that many considered to be Disney's answer to Batman: The Animated Series.

The comparison is an accurate one, for this is easily Disney's darkest, most well thought out, and most complex series ever made.

In the world of ""Gargoyles"", the titular creatures are akin to vampires, in that they turn to stone statues during the day, but come alive at night. The series begins in the year 994, in which a clan of gargoyles protects a castle in Scotland. But through a series of betrayals from the humans, most of them are destroyed, with a slim remainder being put under a magical curse, in which they'll be permanently turned to stone until the castle ""rises above the clouds."" A millennium later, in 1994, billionaire David Xanatos purchases the gargoyles' castle and has it reconstructed atop his New York skyscraper, thus awakening the remainder of the clan. While trying to adjust to their new world, the gargoyles are aided by a sympathetic police officer, Elisa Maza, and quickly come into conflict with the plotting Xanatos. And now with old but wise Hudson, hot shot Brooklyn, funny and imaginative Broadway, tech expert Lexington, loyal dog Bronx, and their noble leader Goliath, our group of outcasts swear to protect the Big Apple from any and all threats, from street crime, to supervillains, to mythical legends and the supernatural.

I can easily see why the series is well loved by so many fans, for the show boasts some great animation that's on par with (and in many respects, arguably, even better than) Batman: TAS. This is a fully realized world that digs deep into mythology while also combining it with modern science fiction. And the plots always keep the viewer guessing, with constant call backs to past episodes--keeping in continuity all the time. Characters or details that seem inconsequential at first often times turn out to be incredibly important later on, and sharp eyed viewers will be greatly rewarded for paying attention.

But by far, the show's strongest point is its characters. No one completely falls into a stereotype, and each of the characters, both hero and villain, make mistakes, learn lessons (that don't beat the viewer over the head) and grow and change as the series goes on. All the villains have various motivations for why they do what they do. Power hungry Xanatos gets what he wants by any means possible, and never loses his cool. When one plan fails, he immediately has a new plan up his sleeves. Some foes, like Macbeth, who just wants his immortality curse to end, are more sympathetic.  And some even turn to the side of good (like some members of the assassin squad, The Pack).  But by and large, the most tragic of them all is Goliath's former lover, Demona, whose hatred of humanity sends her down a path of destruction and loneliness--carved by her past mistakes she refuses to learn from.

Bottom line, this was a series that didn't talk down to its audience, and was unafraid to push the boundaries of what ""children's TV"" was allowed to show. Unique and original, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre.",1504224000,,3592,4.821428571428571

2128705,5,B0002W4SY0,"I just watched Gargoyles for the first time - meaning I have no nostalgia for it - and had *so* much fun. It's a unique blend of fantasy, drama, a cop show, science fiction, and even Shakespeare. And it works so, so, well.

Kids can enjoy this show, but it is definitely not ""dumbed-down"" for kids - characters do get injured or even killed. The antagonists are not one-dimensional ""I'll-get-you-next-time"" evildoers; rather, they are smart and capable, with reason to believe that what they are doing is justified, or even right. There is also a continuous plotline (something I don't think many American animated shows do), complex characters with distinct personalities and goals, and a level of sophistication and maturity that surpasses many ""grown up"" shows I've watched.

I don't want to say too much more because this is a show that I wish I could watch again for the first time and I hope you watch it, if you haven't already. If you have never watched Gargoyles, this is an excellent opportunity and I hope you take advantage of it.",1494115200,,1042,4.751381215469613

2128728,3,B0002W4SY0,"Just finished watching the complete Season 1. Long ago, I'd caught random episodes on television, and I'd wondered about the premise and if it was good. Well, perhaps my tastes have changed, but I don't find much of interest. It has a Hispanic female cop and voices by STNG leads Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis (and, on occasion, Michael Dorn as lead gargoyle Goliath's brother). But it's a combo of ""historical fantasy"" (10th  c. Scotland), wrestling of a sort (The Pack), anime metal warriors, and, in the middle, the gargoyles, who would have been happy enough to serve as personal security for their rescuer-of-sorts David Xanatos (Frakes), if that's what he really wanted. After the 8th episode, the writers assume that the viewer knows enough to follow into more complex story lines--which I will encounter when I wade through Season 2, Part 1. The series continues to have a following, i.e. an annual ""Gathering of the Gargoyles"" fan convention, so I won't dismiss it.
So what's my objection (other than my mild annoyance at Goliath's romantic posturing)? Set aside the sophistication of recent anime (e.g. Attack on Titan, Ghost in the Shell SAC). Look instead at its contemporary, Batman Beyond, which is much superior intellectually and visually. 'Nuff sed. There was better out there at the time, and it still holds up. Some fans of Gargoyles might say the same--but I'm not one of them.",1471651200,,1401,4.961702127659574

2128737,5,B0002W4SY0,"Are you sitting down? Good. Prepare to be familiarized with (or introduced to) one of, if not the, greatest American-made cartoon series ever made. You may think of gargoyles as just decorative carvings on old churches and castles, but in this case, the truth is far more astonishing. In truth, gargoyles are an ancient reptilian race that turn to stone during the daylight hours. Existing behind the scenes, they are sworn to protect mankind in spite of our fear and prejudice to their demonic appearance (the writers of the show borrowed many plot points from the X-men). A thousand years ago, the last remaining gargoyle clan was betrayed by one of their own, placed under a curse and hidden away in the ruins of a Scottish castle. Flash forward ten centuries. The spell was broken when they and their castle were relocated to the City That Never Sleeps. Now claiming Manhattan as their protectorate and aided by an NYPD detective, they're going to have their hands full with this place...

As far as super hero shows go, this is definably in the top five, at least. The writing is crisp, intelligent, dramatic, and quite dark in places, with multiple intersecting story-lines and complex backstories for each character. The characters themselves are a huge draw, with Goliath, the leader (stoic, fearless, etc), Hudson (the old warhorse), Brooklyn (the rookie aide-de-camp), Broadway (the fat, stupid one that everyone loves for some reason), Lexington (the brainiac inventor), and Bronx (the doglike one that can't talk). The voice-over acting is first-rate, with half the cast of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" lending their talents, particularly Johnathan Frakes playing the main villain to Mephistolean perfection. There's much more to cover, but will have to wait until Season Two.",1468108800,5,1792,5.1160409556314

2128780,4,B0002W4SY0,"I recently heard about the series Gargoyles finally being relased on DVD not to long ago so I bought up all the seasons I could get. Starting with this one Season 1.

I am glad it is available because of the fact this show was amazing when it first came out. Very interesting characters, stories, myth and legends, and settings.

I won't go into the story of the series just cause if you're looking at buying this you probably have already seen or know about it.

So this DVD set isn't that great ill admit it. The main reason it is getting a good review from me is just for the fact we finally have it. Most companies from the 90's never seem to want to release their series on DVD or re-release it on DVD (before being only VHS).

The DVD's are bare bones. Barely anything to them other then some trailers for other shows, and a few extra bits of behind the scenes such as a pitch for gargoyles the creator did for Disney way back when.
You can see the big changes that occurred with some of the characters and designs, which I am actually glad happened otherwise we might have ended up with a cartoony dog that eats fire hydrants. :S

There is also the ""gathering of Gargoyles"" type of convention video.

Other then that, there is just a play all button, or episode selection. It could have been even more bare bones (like Season 2 volume 1, and volume 2 are) but I am just surprised they didn't include anymore behind the scenes stuff. But just be glad they released the DVD's themselves otherwise we might have never gotten them till say 50  years from now when most of the cast or creators would have passed away or something.",1447200000,2,1632,4.348684210526316

I've pretty much forgotten a lot of what went on in this show, so it's nice to be able to have them all in this DVD set. The only reason I gave this four stars though is because I'm very upset that the intro does not have the voice following the theme intro: ""One thousand years ago, superstition and the sword ruled. It was a time of darkness, it was a world of fear, it was the age of Gargoyles. [Drum roll please] Stone by day, warriors by night. We were betrayed by the humans we were sworn to protect. Frozen in stone by a magic spell for a thousand years. Now here in Manhattan, the spell has been broken, and we LIVE AGAIN!! We are defenders of the night. We are GARGOYLES!!!""

2128829,5,B0002W4SY0,"The first season of GARGOYLES introduces the character, creatures with a five parter episode that also has an interesting audio commentary with Keith David, the voice of Goliath and Greg Wiseman and Frank paur, the producers and directer of the series! As I've pointed out before on GARGOYLES the second season, there would be no GARGOYLES if not for the success of BATMAN the animated series!

The 5 parter episode starts out in 1990s New York city and in flashbacks goes back to medieval Scotland to show the history of these characters and how a curse was placed on them to turn them to stone both day and night until David Xanatos(Jonathan Frakes) releases them from their spell by raising the castle above the clouds! Meanwhile Demona, a female gargoyle,(Marina Sirtis) plots against Goliath and mankind and blames them for the destuction of her race! Many STAR TREK voices are featured as characters on this show. Xanatos is arrested for his schemes but many conflicts between him and Golaith will be resolved during the course of the series! GARGOYLES is an entertaining, thought provoking show with plenty of plot twists to keep one interested and guessing to what will happen next. It's amazing it lasted 3 seasons considering Disney's track record of having just for kids tv shows!",1426464000,2,1291,4.922018348623853

2128849,4,B0002W4SY0,"Growing up this was one of my favorite shows.  It had a darker tone than many of the other cartoons included in the Disney Afternoon (a time slot on a basic cable channel for those of us whose families didn't subscribe to the Disney Channel back in the 90's).  This cartoon was more like an action movie in cartoon form and had something for pretty much everyone.
Action: Lots of explosions and fight scenes.
Biblical: David and Goliath.
Shakespearean: The three sisters and Macbeth.
Romance: Goliath and Eliza...and later on Broadway and Angela.
Fantasy/scifi: It was a show about gargoyles coming to life and trying to learn about our society and our modern world.
It had magic, revenge and a decent storyline.  It was Disney's attempt at being edgy and more adult, but still keeping the kids in mind.
""Does it hold up?""  You ask.  Why yes, yes it does.  The character design, voice actors and development are still amazing 20yrs. later.
The only issues I really had were with the DVD package and a couple of parts where the show fades out.
The first DVD is in a slot that's supposed to be hinged to the DVD case...didn't arrive like that, but no big deal it's an easy fix-just pop it into place.
There are a few parts where, when originally broadcast the show would fade to commercial and for a couple brief seconds it's just a dark green screen and back to the show.  I'm not sure if this will affect the quality in later viewings and it may be something that didn't get fixed in editing.
Other than those two small issues, I would recommend this show to anyone who likes action/sci-fi/fantasy.  I would especially recommend it to those who enjoyed the show back when it originally aired.
Other than the outdated technological advances shown, the show seems to have stood the test of time.
Granted, if you're not into the darker and more mature side of Disney, this may not be the show for you.  It is a little on the violent side and some of the references to literary characters might go over a very young viewer's head.  And in case you're wondering, yes the voice actor portraying Goliath also portrayed Dr. Facillier in The Princess and the Frog.  This show also has a great deal of Star Trek alum.",1420588800,,2207,4.5620253164556965

2128862,5,B0002W4SY0,"It still surprises me a show as complex and as bold as Gargoyles even exists in the realm of animation. This, along with ""Batman The Animated Series"" and ""The Simpsons"" changed the landscape of animation dramatically. Gargoyles is still a great show because series creators Greg Weisman and Frank Paur had the guts to push the envelope of animation. I highly doubt episodes such as ""Deadly Force"" would even be approved for production today, at least without some resistance. It is important to note however, that while ""Gargoyles"" is a great animated series, it is a great series in general. The story lines are intricate and the audience will fall in love with these characters instantly. Hopefully, the protectors of the night will ""live again"" someday. Highly recommended by someone who is  difficult to impress.",1415577600,2,816,5.044444444444444

The animation is great and the plot (especially in the first several pilot episodes) is among the best story for any of the old cartoons. It's too bad it was such a short season.

Living in SE KS is not very convenient. Enter Amazon. This company rarely disappoints. Not only do they have the products, brands I need, but they are at a competitive or less expensive price. The plus factor. I do not have to load and unload my car with all of these products. I am single and on a fixed income.  Many of the products are not even at the same store.

The show is very entertaining with great visuals, great action but is also has a well written, well though out storyline. This was a cartoon that was ahead of its time....it was sort of like ""the Dark Knight"" of its day. If you love great animated series or are a fan from the 90's looking to re-experience a bit of your youthful days, then this dvd set is a must own! Seasons 1 and 2 are for sure worth picking up.

But other than the nostalgia I got from this seeing it as an adult this time it has an interesting story, the characters are as I remember them to be and it had some surprising twists. Voice acting is top notch, it has a blend of mystery, action and thought provoking scenes that just made me love it even more than before.",1366848000,,436,4.141176470588236

2128919,5,B0002W4SY0,"in the 1990's Disney came up with some of the best lighthearted and colorful cartoons: Talespin, Darkwing Duck, Gummibears, etc.  However, on the other face of the coin was Gargoyles. This show was darker, with more violence and scary scenes then any Disney cartoon before it or after.  Although it may not be for the little ones of the family, it is great for teens and also the adults who remember when this was on the air. I just wish that the rest of the series was available. At the time of this writing all that exists is season two part one.",1365984000,,548,4.362745098039215
2128920,5,B0002W4SY0,"This is by far the greatest thing Disney has ever done.  It was a mature, intelligent animated series.  My dad even liked watching it with me.  It had interesting plots, rich characters & good animation (for the most part).  It was always my favorite Disney Afternoon show.

1-5.  Awakening:  The origin story, about how the Gargoyles lived in 994 AD, were betrayed by 2 of the humans they swore to protect, & were frozen in stone for 1,000 years.  Then they awaken, & befriend detective Elisa Maza & make enemies out of the rich man Xanatos & the evil she-gargoyle Demona.  Disney has done some excellent multi-part pilots/origin stories before (Rescue Rangers' ""To the Rescue"", Ducktales' ""Treasure of the Golden Suns"") but they really outdid themselves with this one.  From the mysterious opening battle on the rooftop to the exciting showdown with the Steel Clan, this is perfect.  A+

6.  Thrill of the Hunt:  The young gargoyles meet their favorite TV characters, The Pack, who aren't what they seem, and Lexington ends up getting Goliath into a messy situation with them.  An excellent follow-up episode.  A+

7.  Temptation:  Brooklyn, out for a joy ride on a new custom-built motorcycle, gets into a bit of trouble, only to be saved by Demona. It seems that Brooklyn and Demona both want Goliath to see the ""truth"" about humanity.  Aside from Brooklyn trusting Demona a little too easily, this was great.  A-

8. Deadly Force:  Xanatos has a shipment of high-tech laser guns stolen from him. After an unfortunate accident with Elisa and her handgun, Broadway goes on a streak of vengeance against someone he sees selling the stolen guns.  A shockingly violent & strong episode on how dangerous guns can be.  A+

9. Enter Macbeth:  A man named MacBeth shows up and seems to know a lot about the gargoyles. He is also searching for Demona. The clan is forced to find a new home in a clock-tower, when Xanatos is released from prison.  A great episode introducing a mysterious new character.  A

10.  The Edge:  Elisa has a new partner, Matt Bluestone, a conspiracy buff. The gargoyles are blamed for stealing the ""Eye of Odin"" after Matt and Elisa see a gargoyle shaped figure stealing it. The Steel Clan is back, new and improved!  A great introduction for Matt.  A

11. Long Way `til Morning:  Hudson is plagued by memories from 984 AD, when Prince Malcolm was poisoned. In the present day, Goliath is shot and grievously injured, but Hudson won't leave him behind, even as they are both hunted by Demona.  This is my favorite episode of the season.  I always loved the flow of the 2 different plots with surprising parallels.  A+

12.  Her Brother's Keeper:  Jackal and Hyena are up to no good again. Xanatos offers Elisa's brother, Derek Maza, a job as a helicopter pilot. Elisa attempts to find out what Xanatos is up to by visiting Fox in prison.  The low point of the season.  It's not bad, it just feels a little contrived and heavy-handed at times.  B

13. Reawakening:  Demona and Xanatos mix Science and Sorcery together to resurrect Goliath's long-dead rookery brother Coldstone.  This is a perfect episode to end the season on.  A+

Then out of the blue popped Gargoyles, a show about the awesome stone creatures that protect our buildings, coming to life during the night for some PG ass kicking action!  But behind the action exterior of the show was a heart of pure gold that tackled the deeper themes of prejudice and racism, encouraging kids to look behind our appearances and see the person on the inside.

The themes of family, friendship, tolerance, duty, honor, etc. are prevalent on this show and the stories are incredibly compelling. The lessons this show taught kids - too much TV is never a good thing, respect your elders, etc. are timeless.

Even with Pixar's incredible animation, Gargoyles is able to compete with their hand drawn, 2-D illustrations - the drawings are just that good.

The influence of the Batman series that was running at the time is obvious and very welcome! The intelligent writing and mature themes were a big hit with kids and adults alike. I myself was in my late 20's, and never missed an episode. (I only wish there were some programs like it today!) Considering how popular it was with kids at the time, I'm surprised there's not more of a following for it. (Those toys were big sellers in their day.) The voice acting was some of the best ever done for any animated series, American or Japanese! Every episode was a great game of ""try and guess the voice"". Was there any ST TNG cast regular who didn't voice a character? (Not to mention Keith David who was doing Spawn on HBO about that time, another underrated show.) This show went places few other ""kids shows"" dared to go. True life and death struggles, real betrayal and many grey areas when it came to right and wrong. The science and technology was very respectfully treated and when combined with the magical/fantasy aspects made for very engaging stories and action. I am disappointed to hear Disney has not released Season 2 Vol. 2, but not surprised. These are the same people who put Gargoyles on their own network and edited them mercilessly! Needless to say I purchased the portions of the series that were available to see them as originally aired and await the rest. I would recommend that if you love Gargoyles you might like all the Warner/DC shows (Batman to JLU), Exosquad(a MUST see!) and Robotech(though it is showing it's age a bit, it's still worth it uncut!) Let Disney know they need to release the rest of Season 2 at least!

2128974,5,B0002W4SY0,"Once uppon a time, in an era known as the Roaring 90's, you could see cartoons in any time block kids were likely to be watching TV without even having to have cable. It is in these ancient times that several excellently written, exciting, and intelligent kid's shows were born into the 2:00 P.M.-5:00 P.M. time block. One of the greatest of these was Gargoyles.

Concerning the adventures, trials, and tribulations of a clan of Gargoyles cursed to remain stone until their castle towered over the clouds in ancient Scotland who's curse was broken by the modern buisness man David Xanatos, Gargoyles is truly one of the shining creative gems of American animation. Even if you watched this series as a kid, as an adult or teenager you will still be enthralled in the story line. The characters in the series, both protagonists and antagonists, are generally more three dimensional than is common for most shows aimed at the same target audience and even episodes about common kid's show themes such as trust, friendship, and family are written with a maturity level that is now rare in any show meant for people under 30.

In a time when American cartoons (and shows aimed at a young adult audience and the people who edit anime for US television as well) tend to sacrifice plot and character development in order to appeal to the lowest common denominator, Gargoyles is a breath of fresh air, whether you're 2 or 52, without having to delve into the anime section of your local video store.",1225152000,2,1491,4.730769230769231

In 1994, the Walt Disney studio took a risk on an unusually dark premise for an animated television series. Little did they know that it would become a critically acclaimed epic. Over a decade after it's cancellation, the series has a devoted cult following. The series was exceptionally well written and the animation surpassed just about every other animated series on TV at the time. But what really made Gargoyles stand out was its mythological, philosophical, psychological and social depth. The stories utilized everything from Shakespearean melodrama to science fiction, from medieval folklore to organized crime. It was also very progressive in a sociopolitical sense. It took a stand against all forms of prejudice and bigotry, and even featured an episode devoted to the dangers of handguns.
The story involves a clan of gargoyles, creatures who are stone by day but flesh and blood warriors by night. The gargoyles are betrayed by the humans they once protected and are frozen in an enchanted sleep for a thousand years. An egotistical and corrupt billionaire awakens them in modern day Manhattan. There they must learn to adapt to a drastically different world where those they protect fear them and those that offer them their support only seek to control them.

The series had an amazing cast of voices to bring to life an even more amazing cast of characters, including:

The noble leader of the gargoyle clan and a fearsome yet just warrior

Hudson- voiced by Ed Asner
The venerable former leader of the clan, and Goliath's most trusted friend and ally

Though Gargoyles only lasted for a few years it managed to spawn a spin-off series (Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles) and its impact on outcast teens and adults today is as strong as when it first aired. Gargoyles wasn't just a flash in the pan trend like many of today's cartoons. It's an intelligent and provocative masterpiece that shows that even if you're different that you can still be accepted, and more importantly that we can help to create a better world by having faith in one another.

Its that GREAT it even makes me sad that there will be no other volumes avalaible :-( Since there is not some Disney Channel service available in my country (and it never was) this show is NEW to me!

Ever wonder what gargoyles did after dark? This is the main premise behind this marvellous Satanimation. The ancient gargoyles awakened by Sorcery into the modern world. With them, comes chivalry & nobility. But also, a host of enemies to contend against. A beautiful female detective aids Goliath, & his band of fellow gargoyles, to fight Xanatos, their major nemesis.

2129003,5,B0002W4SY0,"This is serious cartooning- none of that kiddy stuff here. It can be blatently dark and ominous at one point, but some lighter moments are thrown in to help us realize that being a Gargoyle in NYC can't be all that easy when your used to guarding a Scottish castle for a few hundred years. It is very well written, and has a real story line one can follow as opposed to some rubbish thrown in for filler. Good for older kids and adults who get tired of ""real people shows"", but may make some little ones a bit uneasy(face it- gargoyles were not meant to be pretty!).

It had too short of a life, but at least we can enjoy what we had whenever we want,now. Go get seasons I and II!",1168560000,5,680,4.112781954887218

It is very close to Japanese animation movies and that is exactly why I like this series.  I'm kind of bored from those 'Hey, I'm the superhero, now I will beat you all' stuff.

You are not quite sure what's gonna happen at the end.  Heroes may win or lose.  Stories are always down to earth, they make mistakes, they get hurt, they love and so on.  For example, you know romance will grow between Goliath and Maza but you feel bad when you and they see that it can't be because, well you know... I even felt tears in my eyes in City of Stone episode in season two.  And Maza looks damn good as a Gargoyle if I might add.

If you haven't seen this show and wasted money on other useless superhero 'cartoons' you are missing a lot.  And please, don't call yourself the fan of the genre if you don't own this series.",1166400000,4,931,4.25

The series is quite old (I forget the original airdate), but don't let that fool you.  The series, today, remains one of the best executed cartoon series that I can remember.

Take your basic gargoyle mythos, ""Stone by day, alive at night."" Add a magus, a princess, ancient battles, and throw in a spell that would imprison them in stone until the ""castle rises above the clouds"" and you have a recipe for excellence.

The plot twists on this series alone elevates it from mere children's programming to something an adult will appreciate and find rewarding.  Multiple references to Shakespeare, Arthurian legends, etc., make this series fun to watch.  It's especially satisfying when you recognize such references.

It's definitely worth buying....the only thing left to do is wait for Disney to release the rest of this excellent series.",1156982400,2,963,5.174193548387096

Gargoyles introduced me for the first time to Dostoeyvski, Norse Mythology, African mythology, the Shakespearian plays 'MacBeth' and 'Midsummer Night's Dream,'the concept of bioethics (cloning, cybernetics, etc), and opened my eyes to the racial tensions in my world through the struggle and nearly-genocidal misunderstandings that ensue when the gargoyles interact with judgmental humanity.  Difficult moral issues are explored with realism, consequences for actions are shown, and honor, respect, bravery, and familial love are held up as virtues throughout this series.  I am purchasing these DVDS now to save this series so that I can share it with my future children and with my neices and nephews.

The characters, human and gargoyles, good and bad guys, have a deepth and an  own story, constantly evolving over the time, even more over the second season.

One of the strength of this show lies by the villian, having strong and differed motives, with understandable, often tragic backgrounds, showing more than just shades of grey.

The animation and storyline is just the same as I remember it, rich on so many levels; it is exciting, complex, and intellectually engaging. The characters, especially the lead villains are captivating, not completely evil, but not entirely good either.  In the garg universe, people have reasons for the bad things they do, just as we all do in real life. The Gargoyles Season 1 DVD will not leave you bored, for this is one TV show that does not underestimate its audience. Gargoyles is perhaps the best animated series ever! Even if you are completely new to Gargoyles, I must recommend that you purchase this. Trust me, you won't regret it. The audio commentaries for episodes one through five by the series co-creator, Greg Weisman will put everything in perspective for both the die-hard fan and those who wish to become part of the mysterious and fantastic world of the gargoyles.

I recieved the first and second season part one, for christmas and so far have been pretty disappointed with the first season.

I don't know whether it's just MY copy of the dvd, but there seems to be a problem with the sound quality. The voices of the characters fade in and out, without good reason. (Like they will all be in the same place in a scene, its not like the sound is SUPPOSED to be ""far away"" sounding.. but it just cuts in and out)

Also, the animation and the sound don't appear to be tied together.

The animation lags the sound, and as you watch the episode it becomes more and more obvious.

So far, overall, I have been quite disappointed. The sound issues make it really terrible to watch.",1137888000,8,798,4.258278145695364

Whoever thinks they're demonic, obviously never watched the show, or are lying about ever watching it.  It saddens me that someone can look at a cover and go, ""This is demonic!  No one should get it!  I'm going to post a bad review!  And then I'll go to the other DVD and copy and paste that same review!""  I shall weep for the human race...

The gargoyles are noble beings and protectors.  They'd rather die before losing their protectorate.  One would wish that all humans had that sense of honor and responsibility, instead of caring more about something as stupid as appearances.  We are what we are and our appearances can't change that.

Give this DVD (and the second season DVD) a chance.  Don't listen to those who judge before getting to know something.  Listen to the other 206 glowing reviews, all from devoted fans and people who were rediscovering the series.  I've watched the series for years, and I can tell you with all my heart that it's made me a better person and entertained me while doing so.  Get this for your kids, or get this for yourself.  Watch it with your family.  You will all be thoroughly entertained.

2129050,5,B0002W4SY0,"In 1994, the folks at Disney and creators of the groundbreaking Batman the Animated Series gave American television audiences something they never could have expected: a Disney animated series for both adults AND kids. Drawing inspiration from Disney's wonderful ""Adventures of the Gummi Bears"" combined with what they learned from the enormously successful ""Batman the Animated Series,"" Gargoyles took the already advancing U.S. animation standard and kicked the whole thing up a few more notches! Disney's ""Gargoyles"" proved to be the most impressive and widely enjoyable animated series ever to air on U.S. television before and since, full of thought-provoking drama, realistic situations, well-developed characters, and beautiful visuals that lived up to the Disney name.

The story of ""Gargoyles"" revolves around 6 modern day survivors of an ancient clan of gargoyles from 10th century Scotland. These powerful and intimidating winged creatures live and do battle against evil by night, and sleep by day in the form of defenseless stone statues. Their leader, the imposing and noble Goliath, is plagued with worries brought upon him by the ambiguous nature of the 20th century and the people and gargoyles that repeatedly weave in and out of his circle of trust. The one true ally of the gargoyles is Manhattan Police Detective Elisa Maza, who does her best to protect and guide the creatures as they discover the realities and dangers of modern-day, big-city life. They are threatened by new and old enemies on an almost daily basis, the worst of which is Goliath's former mate, a vengeful female named Demona. The greatest difficulty the gargoyles face, however, aside from keeping their existence somewhat secret, is knowing who to trust, and the most curious person of all is the billionaire businessman who awoke them, the mysterious and powerful David Xanatos. No matter what new plot unfolds around the Gargoyles, the twists and turns most often reveal the manipulative and power-hungry Xanatos to be pulling the strings.

Disc 1: Episodes 1-7

Episodes 1 thru 5 make up of the pilot for Gargoyles, entitled ""Awakening""

These first five episodes introduce our heroes, Goliath the leader, wise, old Hudson, small and mechanically inclined Lexington, big and boisterous Broadway, the teenage-rebel-like Brooklyn, and their dog-like gargoyle, Bronx, and set up the stage for the core of the series. After an introduction to Elisa Maza in modern-day Manhattan, we are flashed back to 994 A.D. Scotland, where the gargoyles battle to defend a castle against Viking intruders, despite the lack of appreciation from the human inhabitants (including the GORGEOUS princess). Through an unfortunate turn of events, the gargoyles are betrayed by a friend, and soon all are dead but Goliath and the 5 others. Cast under a spell to keep them in their stone forms day AND night until ""the castle rises above the clouds,"" Goliath and his friends are finally awakened in modern Manhattan by billionaire David Xanatos, who bought the castle and relocated it atop his towering sky-scraper home. Xanatos passes himself off as a friend to the gargoyles, but time reveals that he is anything but. Xanatos manipulates the gargoyles into stealing 3 computer discs for him, reintroduces Goliath to the bitter mate he thought he had lost a millennium ago, and, when he feels the creatures have outlived their usefulness, attempts to exterminate them. Goliath makes a friend in police detective Elisa Maza though, and together they manage to put Xanatos behind bars; for a while, anyway.

Episode 6: The Thrill of the Hunt

The three younger gargoyles have become obsessed with a TV series called ""The Pack,"" starring 5 wild action heroes, but when Lexington manages to meet the stars, he learns that not everything you see on TV can be trusted.

Episode 7: Temptation

After a motorcycle incident puts Brooklyn in the wrong place at the wrong time, Demona does her best to persuade him to see things her way. It's all part of a plan to place Goliath under a magic spell.

Extras: Feature Commentary for episodes 1-5. Highly enjoyable and informative commentary with the creators and Keith David, the voice of Goliath.

Disc 2: Episodes 8-13

Episode 8: Deadly Force

After seeing his favorite cowboy movie one more time, Broadway stops off at Elisa's apartment for a bite to eat. But, while playing with her gun, it accidentally goes off, landing Elisa in the hospital and in grave danger.

Episode 9: Enter MacBeth

While Xanatos awaits his short jail sentence to be up, a stranger named MacBeth offers to help solve his gargoyle problem, but there's more to MacBeth than he is revealing! In the end, Goliath and the others decide the must relocate to a clock-tower above Elisa's police station for their own safety.

Episode 10: The Edge

The newly released Xanatos donates a jewel to a local museum, then uses one of his robot gargoyles to steal it. His plan is to bring the gargoyles into the public eye, and in a none-too-flattering light, if they won't agree to be at his disposal.

Episode 11: Long Way To Morning

Hudson dreams and reflects on his last adventure as leader of the gargoyle clan, while he and Goliath do their best to avoid extermination by a pursuing Demona.

Episode 12: Her Brother's Keeper

Xanatos offers a job to Elisa's brother Derek as a helicopter pilot and bodyguard, then uses Jackal and Hyena of ""The Pack"" to test him out. Meanwhile, Elisa visits Fox in prison in an attempt to gain information to convince her brother that Xanatos is untrustworthy. By day's end, Eisa discovers that Fox is infatuated with the seemingly infallible Xanatos, and Derek discovers the existence of the gargoyles.

Episode 13: Reawakening

In this season finale, Xanatos and Demona bring one of Goliath's old rookery brothers back to life in a Frankenstein-esque experiment and brainwash him to go after Goliath and his clan. By the time Goliath gets through to his old friend, it is too late. The season ends with Goliath declaring the island of Manhattan to be their new home that they are obligated to protect.

The Gathering of the Gargoyles

This fascinating short piece takes us to a Gargoyles fan gathering in Canada, allowing us to see the impact the show has had on some of its biggest fans!

Original Show Pitch By Greg Weisman

This very entertaining bit of footage is the original show pitch to promote the series to networks, and includes some beautiful production art that I hope we'll see a gallery of in a future season DVD release!

Season One of Gargoyles on DVD is an animation fanatic's dream come true, especially a hardcore Disney-lover like myself! Full of amazing music and voice talent (including lots of  names to make Star Trek fans giddy), the show is brilliantly thought-out and executed, loaded with surprises, and each new episode leaves you hungry for the next one! I truly hope Disney continues to release its excellent animated television series on DVD, from Duck Tales, Gummi Bears, and the Wuzzles, all the way through to Kim Possible (yes, I love those less ""mature"" shows too), and, of course, the rest of Gargoyles! If you loved this show when it first aired, you know why you have to get this DVD set! If you have never seen it before, you have GOT to check it out! You'll be pleasantly surprised at the very least!",1123545600,78,7368,4.962632006498781
2129051,5,B0002W4SY0,"After reading all the other review I really don't think I can add anything :)

Gargoyles is by far the best thing to have come out of Disney/Buena Vista in a long long time. How many cartoons do you know of, that are just as popular a decade later, if not more?

Perhaps ""cartoon"" does not correctly described this stunning animated action/drama, but then, it's hard to define perfection. The characters, the stories, the animation are all incredibly complex and compelling.

Can't wait for the 2nd season to come out. Hopefully in one package so as not to prolong my suffering :)",1123200000,2,580,4.666666666666667
2129052,5,B0002W4SY0,"Why, oh why, did they end this cartoon? It has got to be the most entertaining cartoon I have ever watched! It's about time someone redressed the balance and made some more.",1121040000,2,173,4.4375
2129053,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles is possibly the greatest animated series created by a US company (though it was in fact animated in Japan). Smarter and darker than its contemporaries or indeed any animated show since, it appealed to older kids and adults as much (or more) than it did its target audience of 6-11 year olds. Complex, continuing storylines, literary and mythological references, and superb voice acting featured in episode after episode. It was a show that ended all too soon, mostly due to a station/timeschedule change and a change in its creative team. And it was a show that I was afraid would become lost in the mists of time.

But now, their sleep is over and the Gargoyles live again. I had given up on a DVD release, and I treasured my poor copy of the pilot episode on VHS. But one day, on an impulse, I did a search here on Amazon. When it came up with a result, I nearly fell off my seat. Needless to say I ordered the collection almost immediately.

I would have gladly bought any Gargoyles release on DVD; even if it was just the 5-part pilot episode ""The Awakening"" again. But 13 episodes for this great price! Audio and video quality is as good as can be expected from a TV series transfer. Nice menus with the great theme song blasting away. Haven't checked out the extras yet, but they're not why I got it. Good or bad, they're just that, extra. 13 Gargoyles episodes for the price of a single DVD is fantastic enough.

My only complaint is that it didn't get much publicity. I'd have snatched it up the moment it launched...if only I'd known!

Now, as good as the first series of episodes was, the second was even better (and much longer, as the show changed from weekly to  5 times a week). A couple of weeks ago, I didn't dare hope for a complete Gargoyles series on DVD. But now that I've seen the first part, I truly hope Disney will give us the whole thing.",1120694400,3,1873,4.401734104046243
2129054,5,B0002W4SY0,"Over tens years ago, my roommate and I, was flicking through TV channels and stumbled across the premiere of Gargoyles. Within the first few minutes of the show's run we could not stop praising how great and sophisticated this show was. We immdiataely began to set our VCR to tape every single episode. I have been waiting for Disney to finally release this Masterpiece on DVD. We only have the first season but I will take what I can get and hope the others will come before I am no more.",1119830400,3,489,4.384615384615385
2129055,5,B0002W4SY0,"Throughout the years animation has confronted racism allegorically better than any motion picture has with it's more direct approach. AstroBoy and X-men pioneered a sense of humanities own disdain for those they saw as different and Gargoyles helps continue this trend with it's heroic, deep monsters the center of mankind's distaste.

While this stands as it's obvious heart ""Gargoyles"" pioneers it through strong characterization and youthful moral ideals, yet still never slips into a silly or inauthentic delusion.

Beginning in medieval Scotland, we are treated to a lost race of defenders they stand in defense of a castle holding off attackers for people who offer them no respect or acceptance. There inevitable betrayal traps them in time till a calculating billionaire restores them to life hundreds of years later, bringing them until a world they no longer understand, where they are more feared then ever.

Weissman's attention to historical detail, often gives the story a gorgeous intellectual twist with nods to Shakespearean literature in particular being charming and completely fitting. His forethought with the tale is also very evident, clearly a story planned deeply from it's inception, clever twists come off without any sense of contrivance and as the world and history grows we only come to care more about both our villains and heroes.

The production values especially in this first season, are magnificent. Stylistically the animation is, while never breath taking in grandeur, always impressive and delivers a natural symbiosis between characters that simply could not be done in live action. All the voice acting is spectacular, much of it done by fabled Star Trek stars, all there delivery is brilliant, Keith David's voice carries Goliath's temper, paranoia and nobility in brilliant juxtaposition and Jonathan Frakes enriches Xanatos with slick charm his feigned benevolence always convincing.

The scoring is dramatic and powerful, it doesn't always subdue very well but its overpowering grand nature fits the show to a tea.

Probably the main thing that continues to set Gargoyles aside, is that fact it never condescends its viewers. Goliath heroics are always challenged, he is never perfect and Demona's convictions and losses leaves you still compassionate for her, whatever evils she plans. While the series definitely slips away after the second season, the first to remain a startling achievement that appeals to children and adults in almost equal measure.

A proud addition to my DVD collection, and I only hope that the second season is soon right next to it.",1116892800,5,2605,5.32360097323601
2129056,5,B0002W4SY0,"Oh my Lord of Lords, I must have been living in a cave on Mars with my eyes closed and my ears plugged. Thanks Sideshow Bob...How did this dvd set of quite possibly one of my favorite cartoon series ever? I have no clue. But thank god I found out tonight. Gargoyles was by far an incredibly underrated cartoon when it first came out. I was immediately drawn into the world because of its literary connections and the haunting voice of Keith Daivd. That man's voice is so low!!! I used to watch this during the last years of grade school and the beginning years of high school, and I'm proud that I saw most of the episodes. The story is loaded with love lost, love found, betrayals, tragic heroes, reluctant villains, unrepentant villains, and magic up the ying yang! The Phoenix Gate was the bomb! I was so happy when the powers that be put Batman Animated Series on dvd. Now Gargoyles. Next up must be Exo-Squad, X-Men, Pirates of Dark Water, and I'm sure I'm missing some series that I grew up on. Hey, I'll even take the old Dungeons and Dragons series many years ago. I don't remember much of it, but it was sweet. So final thoughts, if you haven't seen one Gargoyle episode(even though they play on disney and JEtEX), get this dvd set. You will learn much more about Shakespearean characters and literary stories than you will ever know. And if you have seen this series, treat your self to part 1 of many dvd sets of Gargoyles, plus for a cartoon chick, Eliza Maza is sweet!",1116892800,2,1481,4.428571428571429

European literature is truly praised this entire series through.  From Macbeth, to The Once and Future King, as it were, to Puck and Oberon, and Tatiana in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream.'  Never had I ever seen anything that was more educational in European ledgend that was so very fun to watch.  I watched it as a child and followed as much of the story line as I could and was amazed at the development of every character, the transformations that they had gone through.  It was like watching an animated Buffy, or Angel, but better with so many meaningful refernces.

2129062,4,B0002W4SY0,"I first saw the show when I was about five, and I must admit that I really didn't remember being overfond of it.  That's why I was a bit surprised when, upon seeing it recently with my cousin, I realized how remarkable a cartoon it is.  In fact, the word ""cartoon"" is not really an adequate way of describing it; it's comparable to a Japanese anime, or even a more sophisticated television show.  It definitely appeals to a wide range of viewers, from little kids to adults to obsessed fangirls (not that I would know...)

The premise of the show is that a group of Gargoyles, mythological creatures (just several among the many in this show)from Scotland 995 A.D. are stone by day, and alive by night.  A sorcerer in Scotland casts a spell to turn them to stone for a prolonged period of time, and they wake up a thousand years later in New York 1995.  They meet several human characters (including the ""magnificent"" David Xanatos, pardon my fangirl-ism), and work together to protect New York and return to the safety, comfort, and happiness they had a thousand years before.

The characters are rather engaging, some with very intricate and fascinating pasts that are developed quite well (though, unfortunately, not in this season).  There are strong, gutsy female pro- and antagonists, villians that are capable of tenderness and love (though, again, unfortunately not in this season), and some characters that are so funny, they even make us jaded and cynical fangirls laugh (""I don't remember any explosions in Bambi!"").

This is definitely a fabulous series, which I would recommend to anyone who likes fantasy, sci-fi, supernatural, etc.  It's slightly mature and dark, for a Disney show, and is much more intelligent than many shows on the air right now.

I give it four stars because sometimes it slips back into a Disney-like quagmire of preaching morality.  (For example, at the end of one episode, the dialogue is basically, ""I'm so sorry, I should never have played with your gun.  A gun is not a toy."" ""It's all right, I forgive you, I really should have kept my gun in a safer place.  It's not a good idea to leave it in the open where anyone can find it."")

I also gave it four stars because, unfortunately, it only has the first 13 of 65 or so episodes, and though it's an excellent introduction, it lacks a lot of the complex details and intriguing plots of the later episodes.  There are still some great episodes on these two disks, though, and they have a good overarching story that ties them together well.

Decide for yourself; if you'd like a series with intelligent historical, mythological, and literary allusions, characters you can empathize with, and a good amount of action and adventure balanced well with romance, then you might want to consider getting this DVD.  If not... well, then you have the personality of a stump.",1113177600,5,2857,4.748987854251012

2129064,5,B0002W4SY0,"Wow.  That really sums up all I feel about this set.  Wow!  I absolutely loved Gargoyles when it aired.  The smooth, skillful animation.  The professional voice actors (many of whom were stars of the love-running Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The complex and evolving characters.  The rich storylines, interweaving with history and mythology to create a wonderful narrative tapestry.

This DVD boxed set brings it all back.  Or, at least, the first season.  I do SO hope that they release season two as well.  There is so much more to the story.

My only complaint is that there are not scene breaks within the episodes.  I would like to be able to start an episode and scene-skip past the opening music.  Granted, the music for Gargoyles was excellent, and easily ranks as my favorite animated-series music (and even amongst my favorite television music).  But it would be nice to be able to skip it rather than fast forwarding through it.

All in all... Wow!

When is season two coming out?

The creator of the show has already stated on his website, [...] that he has been trying to get the show re-aired (hopefully without interference, the likes of which ruined season three).  Exceptional dvd sales could be the first step to making that happened.  This show was without a doubt a step forward for animation in general and Disney specifically.  It did what very few american animations do and stepped outside the realm of children's entertainment.  To my knowledge Disney has made a similar exception only once, with the recent release of The Incredibles.  If they can abandon their short sighted views, they can achieve truly remarkable things (moreso than what they've done already), but it's up to us the fans to convince them.",1108598400,,787,4.924242424242424

2129070,5,B0002W4SY0,"My favorite ""Gargoyles"" episode used to be ""Deadly Force"" (it has since been taken over by the brilliant multi-part ""City of Stone""), but since Toon Disney has been shortsighted in not airing ""Deadly Force"", this DVD is a chance to view this sublime and groundbreaking episode and a chance that should not be passed up.

The gorgeous five-part ""Awakenings"" is on this DVD as well and there really is no way to describe how much better it is on the DVD than VHS or Toon Disney.  If you have the VHS ""Heroes Awaken"", you may want to check out the DVD.  It is a slightly different (and superior) edit but more than that, the quality of the sound and picture does the story the justice it deserves.

Although ""Gargoyles"" is not my absolute favorite animated series, it remains a sentimental favorite due to its unique premise, fascinating characters, and lively storylines.  And best of all, it doesn't have the smarmy ""in-the-know"" humor that permeated much of Disney's efforts in the 90s.  The writing may not have been top of the line at every juncture (that's difficult for any series), but it never dumbed itself down.  This series respected its audience's intelligence and its willingness to explore the literary, the mystical, and the sly humor.  That makes it a gem worth hoarding.

There are some bonus features on the DVD that are of interest to the hardcore Gargoyles fan, but not necessary to view by those just interested in the series.  I'm not crazy about the chapter/scene access, but that's nitpicking.  Overall, this DVD is a steal at the listed price.

Besides, if enough people buy the first DVD, then maybe just maybe, the entire series will be made available on DVD.  At the very least, the aforementioned ""City of Stone"" multi-part episode deserves the DVD treatment as does the mischievous and playful ""The Mirror"", the romantic ""Eye of the Beholder"" and the hauntingly enigmatic ""Vows"".

Hopefully, Disney will take notice and we, the audience both old and new, will get lucky.",1106611200,6,1998,4.821114369501466
2129071,5,B0002W4SY0,"I'm beyond thrilled that the first season was released on DVD. I first caught this 'toon on an early morning cartoon show that was on every weekday. I'd get up early, get ready for high school (yes, high school!) and watch cartoons while eating breakfast. What's this got to do with anything you ask? Well, the point I'm trying to make is that the other cartoons would just pass before my eyes without raising a glimmer of interest in me. But then when Gargoyles came on I was riveted and was completely annoyed if it ever got taken of air for any reason!

I'm 25 now and am still in love with this show. The only thing that I regret is I never saw every episode and missed seasons of episodes basically. I can only hope they'll release all seasons on DVD so I and no doubt many others in my position can get caught up and re-watch over and over. :-)

This series was amazing. It was great to have a cartoon that wasn't just for the under 6's. (Kiddie cartoons). This series went much deeper than that. The characters weren't just one dimensional cardboard cut outs, they were interesting, full of emotion and each with their own unique personalities.

And the storylines (most importantly) were always full of life and originality. I mean, some of the plots were just tragic (in the sad way, not the bad way) and made me totally feel for the characters.

I could even imagine them episodes as mini movies, and with the release of the movie HELL BOY just recently, it made me really wish they'd make a Gargoyles movie with real people. The make up they'd need to use for the Gargoyles was very similar to what they used for Hell Boy IMO and how fabulous would it be to see Goliath come to life? WOAH. Awesome.

I can't say enough about this series. It's just brilliant.

I recently caught the show on weekends on ABC Family Channel and was reminded of my love for ""Gargoyles."" Greg Weisman and those who worked with him created characters and stories that are more deeply moving than a lot of the shows I've seen on primetime TV. I was entranced by characters such as Demona, who betrayed her clan and then entered into an immortality pact with MacBeth (the only human she ever trusted), only to discover 1,000 years later that her daughter Angela had survived on the island of Avalon. The relationship between Goliath and Elisa also resounded with me, since theirs was a connection built from mutual respect and deeper emotions that neither was able to fully admit (and the fact that they were different species didn't exactly help the matter).

When I discovered that season one of the show was being released on DVD, I sped to the store to buy it (and I'm lucky I didn't receive a speeding ticket). I'm grateful to Disney for releasing the DVD and allowing so many fans to re-experience the splendor of the Gargoyle universe. I'm also incredibly thankful to Greg Weisman for creating characters and plots that still resonate with myself and others, over a decade since their inception.

It seems sometimes that networks and studios don't care at all for the people that watch and enjoy the shows, only how many adds they can bombard them with, how many toys or what not they can get them to buy. Don't get me wrong I can understand the need to make money but if they put the effort into making a show they should give people the chance to buy it.

Greg Weisman really came through for the fans on this one, pressing Disney and never giving up. It's nice to see fans get a say once in awhile.

2129089,5,B0002W4SY0,"First aired in 1994, Gargoyles represented a major shift in the style of Disney's fledgling ""Disney Afternoon"" block of syndicated TV shows. While originally envisioned as a slightly darker take on The Gummi Bears (itself an excellent Disney TV series), Gargoyles evolved into a harder action cartoon. However, in true Disney fashion, the show followed the footsteps of some of the finest American action cartoons of the preceding decade and a half: Batman: The Animated Series, G.I. Joe, Dungeons & Dragons, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, Blackstar, and Thundarr the Barbarian. Those shows were of a smarter breed, and Gargoyles went even further, going so far as to integrate Arthurian legends and even Shakespeare over the course of its 65 episodes.

This DVD set collects the first 13 episodes of Gargoyles, from the 5-part opening miniseries, ""Awakening"", to ""Reawakening"". The episodes are uncut, and unlike recent cable showings, the famous anti-gun episode, ""Deadly Force"", has not been excised. While there has been no remastering of the series, this isn't necessary, as the transfer here is nothing short of impeccable. The special features, while not as jam-packed as some animation DVDs, are of great quaity, as they include commentaries for the ""Awakening"" 5-parter (which is heavily laden with spoilers, so be warned if you aren't familiar with the series, or can't recall future events), the original series pitch, and a feature on the show's fanbase.

If you've enjoyed any of the cartoons I've alluded to, or are just interested in a good, smart show, by all means buy this set. And if you're already familiar with Gargoyles, it's safe to say that you know you want it, because it's just that good.",1103414400,160,1724,5.088339222614841
2129090,5,B0002W4SY0,"There is very little I can add to the many reviews that have been posted about this fantastic animated series which puts many live action shows to shame. However I must warn you that the commentary can become very annoying as they spoil many plot points by telling you what will happen before it does, and also will divulge future season's developments. For the uninitiated, you will become quite irritated when the commentators basically walk you through every episode by revealing the stoylines...Even myself, who watched these episodes 10 years ago, but my strainer brain forgot much, turned off the commentary in disgust...So while the commentators do provide interesting information, they are just too gabby about the plots to make them enjoyable, especially during the initial viewing........5 stars for the show...2 stars for the commentary...",1103414400,3,850,5.303703703703704

2129092,5,B0002W4SY0,"""Gargoyles"" was a series released during the ""Disney Afternoon"" block of the mid-nineties.  What makes it so unique is that it's still the only dramatic animated series Disney TV has ever produced.  It stunned people at the time with its tragic plots, realistic weapons, and clear consequences to characters' actions.  It's definitely not for young children (the Y7 rating is a good guideline), but don't think it's just another brainless afternoon shoot-'em-up designed to sell action figures.  The backbone of this saga is what all timeless fiction must contain: plot and character development.  The writing is taut, the acting fantastic, and the animation beautiful, but they are all mere servants to the story, which stays interesting and moderately serialized throughout the entire series (this is just the first season here, 13 of 65 episodes).

Overall, I think this is the best animated television series to ever come out of this country.  If you at all appreciate the art form, you'll wonder where this show has been all your life.  In a time when comedies are saturating both the primetime and daytime cartoon markets, it's nice to find a gripping animated drama without needing to set your sights to the other side of the Pacific.  Highly recommended.",1103068800,9,1262,5.087378640776699
2129093,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles was one of the two best cartoon series(Batman TAS is the other) aimed at kids. It works specifically because it does not insult the audience's intelligence. Kids will enjoy the Gargoyles' adventures, while older people will enjoy the deeper plot and near constant Shakesperean references.  (and no, this isn't boring Shakespere, its dynamic and fun) Its also a great series because most of the characters have, and are driven by serious motivations.",1103068800,3,459,5.287671232876712
2129094,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles is really unique.  American animation gets put in the ""kiddie bin"" too often, and Gargoyles breaks out of that bin as easily as the Gargoyles shed their own stone skin.

Jonathan Frakes lends what I can only describe as the best Villian voice of any animated series, ever, hands down.  Better than Mark Hamill's deleriously disturbing Joker, better even than Jim Cumming's skin-crawlingly menacing Scar.  He's smooth, sophistocated, and exactly as evil as is necessary given the situation.

My praise of the voice acting can not stop there, because Kieth David knocks one far, far out of the ballpark with Goliath.  The dramatic impact of this guy's voice can not be overstated.  Rich, brooding, and powerful, it takes every line and adds two or three more layers of meaning.  Goliath himself is a beautifully rendered tragic hero, betrayed despite his best intentions, then betrayed again despite his best efforts to guard against it.

There are no ""duds"" in the voice acting.  All the voices are good, although Xanatos and Goliath are definitely the shining stars here.  Michal Dorn's part as Coldstone was, as one would expect, brooding and cool, but better, Dorn is doing this whole Marry Shelly's Frankenstein act which really works when you're a thousand-year-dead gargoyle resurrected as a cyborg.  Marina Sirtis does some deviously scary acting as Demona, the centuries-hardened ex-love of Goliath.  I had no idea Sirtis could pull off that kind of anger.  (Tragically, we don't get to see the episode where Demona and her 1000-year younger self meet in season 2; it's obvious Sirtis is making them the same person, but you could close your eyes and Still.  Tell.  Them.  Apart.)  And I couldn't possibly forget Salli Richardson's -amazing- tough-cop act; she knows exactly when to let her vulnerability show through the tough exterior.

None of this would matter without the animation, though, which never fails for a second to do justice to the brilliant, brilliant voice acting in this series.

An amazing set of stories with awesome animation and even more incredible voice acting.  I bought two, in part because it'll make a great gift, and in part because I want them to put out the rest of the series on DVD so I can get ingenous episodes like The Mirror, Avalon, and Future Tense.",1102982400,3,2306,4.968668407310705
2129095,5,B0002W4SY0,"Thankfully this classic was brought back. Now hopefully we can get season two next, where the series really takes off.

I have to say, this is the best American-made animated drama that I've ever seen. I admit, that category doesn't have much competition. But this is a great show. I highly recommend it.

The character development is amazing. It's wonderful to see how they develop over time (again, the 2nd season would only improve upon this). On top of that, original plots, with many intricate side stories that inevitably come back over time.

It's not flawless. Sometimes, it's a little heavy-handed trying to send messages to kiddies. No surprise, since I believe it was originally targeted towards kids. But trust me, this is still an enjoyable DVD that people of men and women of all ages can enjoy.",1102982400,5,809,4.8478260869565215

I finally saw all the episodes in the order in which they were originally aired.

2129098,5,B0002W4SY0,"After what can only be called an excruciating wait, the
finest animated drama ever conceived by Disney makes
its debut on DVD. Commemmorating the 10th Anniversary
of the show's premiere in 1994, GARGOYLES: THE COMPLETE
FIRST SEASON releases that year's thirteen episodes in
beautifully-remastered, thankfully uncensored form.

Those who cringed at the edited-down pilot film issued
on VHS some time ago, or the chopped down editions for
Toon Disney, will be more than pleased at the completely
restored episodes, let alone the fine audio commentary
placed in the original 5 part debut (Buy the set, find
out who speaks! Trust me, it's worth your time). Anyone
who's never seen GARGOYLES before, or thinks of Disney
cartoons only as narrative bold strokes of morality and
moral, without inner nuance of characterization, will be
in for a huge surprise here.
One of the greatest sagas of Tolerance and Ethics ever to
hit Television, GARGOYLES is a sterling representation of
that great period of the 1990s, where Science Fiction and
Fantasy took broad steps forward in dramatic presentation.
With BABYLON 5, THE OUTER LIMITS, ST: DEEP SPACE NINE, and
THE X-FILES, GARGOYLES is a showcase of exceptional writers
propelling cast and crew into a cornucopia of mythology and
morality play, mulitculturalism up against both pride and
prejudice across the span of ages.
In the tale of Goliath, his clan, and the people he comes
to regard as community (despite his own personal losses),
we see the essential story of Humanity: our best virtues
ever at odds with our basest instincts, the latter ever
waiting for the one slick or jarring excuse to justify
any narrow-mindedness, from anyone. Or everyone.

Yes, in GARGOYLES, there is tragedy which stabs to the
core, more than matched by the struggles for identity
in the world at large. For each period of intense trial,
there are moments of gleeful humor which warms the heart.
And, for all the hostility which the GARGOYLES must
confront, there is also grand camraderie and, as the
series' next 2 seasons will show (Should Disney be wise
enough to release them!), the deepest romance.

I'm budding to just spill the beans about what
GARGOYLES has per episode, but you readers have such
a treat in store for you that I don't have the heart
to spoil it for you! Let's leave it to this: Those
who loved the character play found in features such
as THE IRON GIANT will really go for that caliber
of aesthetic in what was an ongoing TV series!

Take an old poet's word for it. Take a chance.
GARGOYLES awaits!

Don't wait for the night to bring the magic to you.",1102636800,2,2600,4.860045146726862
2129099,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles is without a doubt the most engaging and captivating animated series that Disney has ever commited to the small screen. A fantastic drama mixed with just the right amount of comdey and sensitivity to draw you in and keep you there. 10 years later, we are still talking about it! Disney poorly handled the series in its last season (3rd to be exact. ""The Goliath Chronicles"", it was called if anyone wants to avoid its foul stench) and was cancelled. If anyone even considers buying this DVD they are on the right track. The more DVDs purchased the more likely Disney will be to release the rest of the episodes, and there are some mighty powerful ones that occur after the first season, let me tell you! Gargoyles broke new ground, and was taken off the air FAR too early, so show your support, or interest, and buy this DVD. You will not be dissapointed!",1102464000,6,865,4.551282051282051

This series is what got me into drawing dragons, gargoyles, etc..

I owe it to this series for all the fun times of watching it and seeing something new and I hope you buy this dvd i'm sure you'll never regret it.",1102464000,4,478,4.184782608695652
2129101,5,B0002W4SY0,"It's amazing how after 10 years this series still resonates within me as deeply as it did when I first saw it. Gargoyles is one of the finest animated series of all time. The story of the Gargoyles is not one of happiness and acceptance, but a tale of trying to find a place among a society which largely rejects them. The lines between good and evil are constantly blurred and the view learns rather quickly that no character can be fully trusted and many are not who they appear to be.

  It begins over a 1000 years ago, during the time when the vikings were invading Scotland. The Gargoyles, statues of stone by day but creatures of flesh and bone by night, had dwindled down to just one solitary yet steadfast clan. The sole purpose of this dwindling race seemed simply to be to guard the castle which they shared with the humans who returned their loyalty with hatred and loathing. In the end, they were betrayed, nearly killed off, and the remaining were turned to stone until the day when ""The castle rose above the clouds""...or so the curse said.

Fast-forward 1,000 years to the year 1994 where an insanely rich man by the name of David Xanatos has purchased the ancient castle ""lock, stock, and Gargoyle"". He has the castle re-assembled ( conveniently above the clouds) on the rooftop of his giant skyscraper, all the while very aware of the curse and the Gargoyle's history.
  When night falls, the stone cracks away and the Gargoyles live again. Xanatos brings them over to his side, but how honest are his intentions?

I suggest this DVD for anyone who is seeking excellent television in an age where there is little be found on air currently and well, to just about everyone in general. Anyone, regardless of age, will get something out of this series. It's chalk full of history, ancient lore, and it's positively filled with some of the best Shakespearean references and plot-lines that I have seen anywhere, ever.

Oh, and if you like this first season, just wait until season 2. It will blow you away! Honestly, this show is technically superior to just about every show on television today. I really wish I was joking when actually I'm not in the very least. Do yourself a favor and GET this DVD!",1102464000,5,2216,4.592405063291139

First of all, the episodes are absolutely amazing, much more crisp and clear than anything on TV or VHS, the sound is great.  Even the menu had me mesmorized for a moment.

The bonus features alone are worth it for the hardcore fans.  The Gathering of the Gargoyles featurette was so much fun to watch and makes me look forward to going to my first one next year.  The ""pitch"" bonus is fun, in a cringe-worthy ""I'm so glad it turned out better than that"" way.

The only complaint I can think of right now is that it seems that they kept some of the editing in ""Deadly Force"", where they shrunk the blood pool, but I'll have to dig out my VHS to see if that's correct.

I was getting this for Christmas, but I couldn't wait, and I figured one more DVD sale would be better.  Buy 4!  I think any of the fans can justify spending that much for a possibility of a second DVD or bringing back Gargoyles.  Donate a copy to a children's hospital, shelter, or library.

With a great cast for voices and one of the best opening credits songs ever, Gargoyles was probably the best alternative to superhero cartoons out there.  The DVD's do a great job in recreating the feeling of when the show first came out and have very cool menus.  There isn't too much bonus material, but compared to some other TV shows, it isn't bad.  The only problem is, while watching the episodes, you remember how some of the characters seem to have NO motivation at all and just perform random acts of good or bad. Also, the storyline is subject to drastic changes (most of which they set up from about a mile and a half away) and I can't count how many times the phrase ""but I thought..."" was uttered.  But with a good group of core characters and some nice ""add on"" villains, Gargoyles is a show definately worth the price of admission.",1102377600,6,964,4.5813953488372094

It has quality animation, a great storyline, and the characters are all so REAL. They're not one-dimentional like in so many series these days. Gargoyles is great not just for kids, but the older crowd, too. When I first started watching gargoyles, I learned of the online fandom for it. There I met people from ages 8 to 50 or so who loves the show, albeit mainly between the ages of 10-25, but that is a wide range for ANYthing.

This simply is a series you have to see.

It's a dark, atmospheric, intelligent series, the like of which I had never before seen in a cartoon.  It's densely plotted and rich with fascinating, living, breathing characters.  The first season is a necessary introduction into the relationships and memories that drive the story, even one thousand years later.  While many of the actors providing voice work are best known to Trekkies, they did incredible work without ever having to show their faces.  Especially Marina Sirtis, whose performance as Demona added additional depths to an already-layered character.

2129114,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles is, without a doubt in my twenty-one year old brain, one of the best television series I have ever seen, and certainly top-notch among animation.  I won't bother you with plot synopses, as I'm sure that they are readily available in others' reviews and in the description of the product.  What I will tell you is that I believe everyone will find something in this show appealing.  I recommend this show to anyone and everyone. If you have kids, it would make a great Christmas present. The show is entirely suitable for anyone above the age of four, but it has levels of depth that adults will appreciate greatly.  How many other children's shows will reference real Scottish history, Shakespeare, and gun violence?

The show presents a strong sense of morality.  The characters may look demonic, yet they are benevolent protectors, even of the people who fear them.  Parents do not have to worry about their children being corrupted- this show will teach them not to play with guns, not to judge people without getting to know them, and many other valuable messages.  On the other hand, it never becomes moralistic and preachy.  The characters act as characters in these situations would, and we derive morals not from pat monologues at the end of the episode but simply by seeing the results of the characters' actions.  There is a depth and restraint almost unheard of in children's television.

Then again, this show is not all over-the-top drama.  There are lots of episodes in which I could not stop laughing, such as ""Thrill of the Hunt,"" with an overblown parody of the Power Rangers and other action-filled kids' shows.  The action scenes are very well animated and exciting, yet they rarely eclipse the plot of the episode.  The music, by Carl Johnson, is stirring and always appropriate.

This is a beautiful show, one that will stand the test of time.  I encourage all of you to give it a try.  To this day, it remains one of the defining moments of my childhood.  Why not let someone else be able to say the same?",1102291200,4,2037,4.706214689265536
2129115,5,B0002W4SY0,"I have been waiting for so long for this awesome cartoon series to be released on DVD!! The old VHS editions of these shows were really bad in picture quality and were in dire need of new picture cleanup and now the long wait for at least the first season to be on DVD is finally FINALLY OVER!!

 This show broke so much ground when it was premiered on TV in the fall of 1994. The overall tone was a whole new dimension in the Disney empire because it veered away from the goody-two-shoes nature of old and replaced it with a much more serious, much more Gothic and darker tone, something that Disney sadly doesn't seem to have made many attempts at doing ever since and rescinded back into bland boring cartoons.

 It starts in 994 A.D. where Gargoyles were the guardians of the Castle Wyvern in Scotland but were feared by the humans that they had sworn to protect and the prejudic against them culminated on a horrible night in 994 when Viking invaders sacked the castle and when the gargoyles were stone during the day, they were all smashed to dust except for six gargoyles who either were away fighting enemy forces or were in the egg hatchery that was not accessed by the Vikings.

 Due to a curse that would keep them stone until the castle 'rose above the clouds', they would not reawaken until a thousand years later in the year 1994 atop a superscraper owned by a multi-billionaren named David Xanatos. However, the world they knew was long gone and they find themselves in the city of New York.

 The show featured the voicework of the Star Trek TNG cast and other great actors and actresses. The characters are incredibly amazing and show great character ranging from the leadership role of Goliath to antagonists like Demona, or Xanatos.

 This is a DVD to own today!!",1102118400,7,1782,4.5233644859813085

Now, I'm over 40, and I worked at the Disney Studios when this was in production. I've studied Shakespeare and Mythology at U.C. Berkeley, and I can attest this series made me start looking things up and finding that these ""cartoons"" were culling from stuff even I didn't know about!

If you're a parent and worring about violonce or brain-dead entertainment, this series is the solution. Characters actually grow over time as the line between ""good"" and ""evil"" gets blurred. Some of the bad are redemeed and heros fall from grace. It reminds me of my favorite quote from ""Into the Woods"": ""Witches can be right. Giants can be good. You decide what's right. You decide what's good... No one is alone.""

This show will teach the younger kids all about the consequences of our choices, both short-term, and long (even centuries!); standing for what you believe in and also learning to comprimise. Older kids will learn a ton of Shakespearian and Authrian lore as well as Norse and Greek mythology, ancient Myan and Egyptian culture, and other stories totally unfamiliar to Americans like the Judaic Golem, and the African tale of Anansi.

The main characters haven't any ""race"" but have to deal with racism while the lead human character (Lt. Elisa Maza) is an NYPD Detective that comes from a racially diverse family of an African-American mother and Hispanic father.
This show got me into a bit of research about such diverse subjects as the Illuminati, Avalon, to bionics and cloning. So many different subjects are touched and discussed, but never does the show preach a ""right"" answer and leaves the viewer to make their own judgements.

One final bit of fun is to point out the large number of great talent (a large group from the new Star Trek shows) that are featured regulary in the series:
Ed Asner, Paul Winfield, David Warner, Tim Curry, Robert Culp, Sheena Easton, John Rhys-Davies, Peter Scolari, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Jim Belushi, Tony Shalhoub, Terrence Mann, Robert Ito, and Roddy McDowell; from Star Trek the Next Generation you have Johnathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis, Brent Spiner, Colm Meaney, LeVar Burton, and Michael Dorn (2 roles), Avery Brooks of Deep Space Nine, with Kate Mulgrew from Voyager voicing 2 roles (well kind-a, you'll have to watch and see what I mean.) and Nichelle Nichols from the original Star Trek.

The plot lines were well thought out and easy to follow I was hooked then and still am. Whenever I see Keith David reguardless of what he plays all I hear is Goliath good or bad thats who he is to me.

I had planned to transfer my old tapes to it, but now I don't have to. Bring on all of the season so I can get my cartoon fix.",1101772800,3,624,3.691729323308271
2129120,5,B0002W4SY0,"I know a lot of us are writing reviews even before the DVD is out, but I'm sure our love for this show won out waiting to write after the release date.

Already out on VHS, the DVD version will be just as worth it.  I don't even remember how what my age was when I first started watching Gargoyles, but I watched it everyday- reruns and all.  When they took this show of the air all those years ago, I cried.  Now, I'm crying for joy and for everyone to buy this.

Unlike so many shows (both TV series, films, dramas, or other animations), Gargoyles was a thoroughly developed series with continual storyline.  The plot builds on itself, but does not make it confusing for someone who randomly turned to that channel.  It just makes a person want to buy the past episodes and watch them ^_^.  Magic, history, literature, technology, and what it means to be a person (whether a witch, gargoyle, human, or Puck).  Love, hate, betrayal, and the power to trust.  Gargoyles includes all these aspects and more, including different cultures (heh, the episode in Japan).  I am still enthralled by the animation, plot, characters, themes, and music of Gargoyles.

I really really hope they bring out Season 2.  As much as I want an actual conclusion, with the whole leaving Avalon, the children *cough cough*, and the many relationships, these old episodes are just as worth buying.  And yes, I have already placed this on order the moment I found out the DVD version was being released.",1101427200,9,1479,4.595419847328245

2129123,5,B0002W4SY0,"There is little more I can say that many have not already stated.  However, I feel it is important that I state that this series, ""Gargoyles"" was the best show I had ever seen, growing up and maturing.  The themes are multi-dimensional and aimed at adults as well as children.  A program you can watch and then return to and see it in an entirely new light.  I say to anyone that does not give this series a chance because it is a ""simple cartoon"" is not only being unfair, but depriving themself of quality entertainment.

To anyone who says, ""But they look like demons"" I say that's the point.  People have dificulty looking beyond skin, deeper than facade.  It's a statement about us as human beings, the experience of growing up, fantasy, magic, science, love and hate, all together.

Some of the greatest animation the industry has ever seen acompanied by soem of the best writing anyone could ask for.  There is little more anyone could ask for in art of story telling.",1100822400,10,975,4.557471264367816
2129124,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles, in my opinion, was the last good thing Disney ever released up until they aligned with Pixar.  Even then, those works pale in comparison.

I watched this series religiously with my best friend every time it aired.  I would run home from school to catch the afternoon showing.  Ever Saturday morning 11 am on the nose we would drop our Barbies and kick any siblings away from the tv.  Even at a tender age, I knew that what i was watching was more sophisticated and adult-like than any other show out there.

The depth of the storylines, the complexity of issues astound me just to think about them.  They touch on racial, marital, and violence issues.  The fact that the show could take fictional characters and give them so many strong traits to shoulder the burden of the problems raised in the series, coupled with the fact that it was entertaining and witty and fun; well, it just proves that Gargoyles had well deserved its place in cartoon and drama history.

I am looking forward to this release and I will definitely go out and buy it.  I cried the day they pulled it off the air, especially since it was rumored that they were going to cushion the blow with a movie or at least a double episode.  At least now I can watch the characters I have long loved and missed.",1100822400,6,1286,4.452991452991453
2129125,5,B0002W4SY0,"I fell in love with this show ten years ago when I was a kid. It was cool for lots of reasons. First of all, it was part of the Disney Afternoon (Anyone else remember that?). It also had cool characters. I mean how can you beat Elisa Maza who isn't really afraid of anyone or anything and can kick almost anyone's [...]? Or how about Goliath was is uberstrong, but also intelligent? Or the supposed villian, David Xanatos who sometimes fights the Gargs, but sometimes forms alliances with them? Or Demona the crazy redhead who hates humans and carries around a laser gun? I mean for a kid in elementary school it was great.
  Now that I'm older I still love the show. Unlike many other animaterd shows of the day (and completely unlike 90% of the shows on TV today) the characters are 3 demensional. There also isn't a clear cut notion of who and what is bad and good. Everything's in a grey area.

Gargoyles is a series that I didn't really get into until much later after it first aired...earlier this year, in fact. I was a fan when I was younger, but at the age of 7~8 I certainly didn't catch all of the great references (Shakespeare, mythology, etc). Gargoyles is one of those great series that goes right under many people's radar, and it really shouldn't be.

First of all, Gargoyles is pure magic. Anyone who sits down to watch the first episode will find themselves immediately wrapped up in an intense, action-packed plot that leaves you dying to know more about the world of the gargoyles. Not only is the art and animation spectacular eye candy, but the story and dialogue is so well written and directed that it feels real. From people who are just now discovering (or re-discovering) the show by watching re-runs to old die-hard fans, there is something spellbinding about this series that will leave everyone with a little extra something inside of them.

Gargoyles is truly one of Disney's finest.

Now, here's the deal:

If this DVD release sells well, Disney will be releasing the second season out onto DVD as well--a season that has NEVER seen video/DVD release. So please, pre-order the DVD now or buy it ON DECEMBER 7TH! If a lot of people buy this DVD the day it becomes available, the ratings here on Amazon will skyrocket; not only providing more publicity for the show, but proving to Disney that there is still a fan base that's alive, kicking, and demanding more Gargoyles!

If both DVDs sell well then it is very likely that Disney will start up the series again; quite possibly enlisting the same writers and much of the original voice cast to work on the new episodes. I don't know about you, but this is great news to me! Let's all pitch in and give this wonderful show the place of honor it deserves!

It has a deep, complex plot that works on several levels so that different ages groups are able to enjoy it, fantastic animation, particularly for a TV show, and wonderful, engaging characters. Few TV shows or movies can boast a cast with this many different, interesting characters. It managed to strongly convey good lessons without being preachy - for example consider the episode where Broadway learns about playing with guns the hard way. Wow!

One of my favorite things about this series was how it used mythology from all cultures and Shakespearean characters to create the story. Macbeth's plotline may not be at all what William had in mind, but it sure does make a great story here.

Back in 1995, I painstakingly taped every episode of this show, edited the commercials out and put them in order on VHS tapes for my own personal viewing. I was sure I would never get an official copy of the whole show and I wanted to perserve it for future enjoyment. So, I am extremely excited about this DVD set.

A decade ago, things were different on all fronts for the Mouse House. One of the best series they ever produced (and most mature by far) was GARGOYLES, in 1994 - in fact, it was the last great original series they produced, as far as I'm concerned.  I loved the show and haven't been able to see it in years, so I'm very thankful that it's on DVD, finally.  The first season was definitely the best of the bunch.

Like Batman, it has a stirringm usical score and a distinctive dark style.  Like Beast Wars, it is populated with memorable characters.  Unlike those two shows, however, it has lots of classical and mythological references - this is a show that does not talk down to the viewer, unlike so many shows today (""The Batman"", anyone?)

2129170,5,B0002W4SY0,"Ah, Gargoyles, at long last getting a well-deserved DVD release. This series is really excellent and has the honor of being one of Disney's most mature animated series to date.

The series centers around a group of living gargoyles, who are stone during the day and flesh at night. Due to a curse laid upon them, a small group of these creatures are frozen in stone for a thousand years before being reawakened in Manhattan in 1994. Like all supernatural beings in Manhattan, they naturally decide to fight crime. It may sound cheesy, but in the hands of a splendid team of writers the series becomes way more than just another 'non-human superheroes fight crime' story. Instead, Gargoyles becomes an interesting story with an engaging storyline and good characters.

This series is helped by its ability to take risks -- the first episode even ends with what is essentially a mass murder. The show also tackles issues such as gun control in ways that are fairly mature and realistic while managing to be neither overly moralitsic or preachy. For example, the gun control episode 'Deadly Force' (shamefully omitted by Toon Disney in its run of the series due to the presence of guns and gunplay, despite its strong message *against* the unexperienced playing with such weapons and thankfully restored uncut in the DVD release) gets its message across without having the characters stand around saying ""Guns are bad, mm'kay?"" The series also has a tightness of continuity rarely seen in American animated cartoons; actions in previous episodes effect later ones and episodes have a fairly set order -- unlike some of Disney's other toons at the time, Gargoyles episodes generally had to be aired in the proper order in order to make sense. The series is also rife with references to Shakespeare (as well as other things; the first episode of season two contains, of all things, a Kafka joke that I didn't get for *years*).

Gargoyles really is one of the most interesting and unique cartoon series in Disney's vault. This DVD is a great buy for long time fans and highly recommended for new people curious as to what it's all about. The first season sets up the rest of the series wonderfully and gives the viewer an idea of what this series is all about in general. I'm already eagerly awaiting future releases of the rest of the series.",1098489600,14,2337,4.808457711442786

If this DVD sells well, Season 2 might be released and things get even deeper well with real lifes without being preachy at all.",1098316800,8,380,4.1506849315068495

Not only was (is) it a totally awesome show (even for a 'cartoon', it was mature and beautiful was well as magical), it has created a huge fandom that is still strong after 10 years. Only a show with good writing could do such a thing. It has brought so many people together, and I don't think I could name any single show that has ever done that before it.

There are so many other things that I could say, but I'd probably go overboard or something. But the only other thing I can say is....it's been ten years?? Honestly, I never thought of it that way. It made time fly by so fast...

For people of all ages and all creeds! The best `cartoon' ever made! I enjoyed 'Gargoyles' ever since it came out, and I know you'll love this DVD. SOS! (Support Our Gargoyles!)",1098230400,8,993,4.385869565217392

It's got everything a good animated show needs - excellent writing, intruiging and well-realized characters, terrific voice actors, and compelling animation.  For ten years fans have been moved by this show -- there are yearly conventions held, stories written, and art produced all for the love of this show.  With a loyal and ever-growing fan base not unlike the original Star Trek's after it was cancelled, we hope one day to see this show picked up again, and we will do everything we can to support it!

It only took ten years to have this show recognized and given the proper treatment it deserved, which includes all episodes uncut and as they originally aired.  There haven't been many cartoons, or shows for that matter (animated or not) to come close to the scope of Gargoyles.  The characters, animation, the history and neatly interweaving plotlines, incredible voice actors, the scope, the power and messages it conveyed has created a following that extended far beyond it's cancellation; even eight years later, people still celebrate it through art and fiction, an annual convention and a worldwide community of fans.  And I know it's been a big part of my life and my imagination.  Let's hope sales are high enough to warrant a season 2 release...",1098144000,9,843,4.826388888888889

But hey, buy the DVD and you're supporting the Gargoyles universe!  If this does well, they'll put out Season 2!  and then if that does well, who knows....maybe we'll get our show back with all new eps?  Its a possibility people.  So buy the DVD!

2129176,5,B0002W4SY0,"As a fan of 'Gargoyles' for nearly seven years I am excited to see our beloved 'Gargoyles' come on DVD after having the release date pushed back on us several times.

What may have started out as just another traditional cartoon became a well loved favorite and it has developed a faithful and ever growing fanbase over the years even to this day. For me it took one episode and I was hooked on the show. Then a few years later I rediscovered the show and joined the internet fanbase.

'Gargoyles' follows a clan of Scottish gargoyles that wake up in modern day New York City after their ancestral home is bought and reassembled atop a New York building while they slept via a magical spell that would only break when the castle rose above the clouds. The clan faces many challenges, including adapting to a new era and their new city they swore to protect and hoping to be accepted by the people of their new city. They meet and make human friends along their way, including NYPD cop Elisa Maza who becomes close with them all, especially their leader Goliath.

The show 'Gargoyles' has something for everyone- mythology, a hint of romance, adventure and even some Shakespeare.",1097884800,6,1178,4.626794258373206
2129177,5,B0002W4SY0,"After 76 reviews, I'm sure the reader has taken note of many of the high points of ""Gargoyles"", including the strength of its animation, the talent of its voice actors, and the surprising composure of its plot arcs. So I will simply ramble on impact the show had on me personally.

More than any teacher I ever had, the show inspired me to embark on an educational voyage investigating everything from the literature of Shakespeare to the history of the Mayan empire to comparative anatomy, in search of what the ""reality"" of the fantasy universe of Gargoyles must have been.

Yes, I found it *that* compelling. Parents, let this be a lesson to you: there is no better way to engage your child (or yourself!) in learning than to pique their interest in an original manner- and there are few things that balance magic, science, true history, and world-wide myth as well as ""Gargoyles"" does.

As to why I found such inspiration...

There are shades of grey that most ""children's"" shows refuse to recognize- rather than glossing over feelings like hatred and grief, the show's characters attempted to help one another cope. Good guys were capable of making the wrong choice for the wrong reasons; the main antagonist, a man primarily motivated by greed and a lust for power, never fell into the typical villain's obsession with revenge- he considered it a ""sucker's game"". David Xanatos never did anything underhanded just for the sake of being evil; there was always solid reasoning behind his actions.

Gargoyles as a species were born (or hatched, rather) with an instinctual need to protect.  Even betrayed from their allies- and within their own ranks, for humans do not hold a patent on treachery or perfidy- and the resulting death of most of their clan, the handful who were bespelled in 994 immediately adopted Manhattan as their new protectorate when they awoke from the enchantment. (A city whose reaction to the gargoyles when their presence was revealed was a far cry from hailing them as heroes for their noble actions.)

Goliath's clan only wanted to be accepted for who and what they were- a desire that one need not have wings or a tail to sympathize with. I believe it was this simple underlying theme that is the reason why ten years later it remains so meaningful to so many. The show spoke volumes to those in the audience who felt the same way- misunderstood, unappreciated, unwelcome...disliked for not fitting the image of what society expects of its population when all they wished to do was serve that society with their abilities.

Above all the show sent the message that no matter what the odds, or how difficult the road, you had to stay true to your own purpose. From Gargoyles, I took away a reaffirmation of the belief that no matter how one's sculpture, or drawing, or writing -whatever you do that you feel defines you - is received by society, you shouldn't stop doing it. No matter what obstacles you face, you have to keep persevering because your reason d'etre is as vital to you as the air you breathe- and to give it up would be just deadly.

2129178,5,B0002W4SY0,"ahh Gargoyles, *sings the TV theme* ..

ahh, 1994.. Year of the Lion King , Black Beauty, ( the one with Sean Bean), Aladdin T.V series ( I won't mention the sequel). and some of the other things I can't remember.. but oh well,..

anyway, I was 16 at the time gargoyles appeared. I have to admit I wasn't too thrilled about it at first ( I think I missed the contmeparary opening) I guess medieval shows aren't my thing..

but anyway , Once the Gargoyles came to New York I was hooked. these Gargoyles were not like any animated creature I had ever seen. I always heard stories about Dinosaurs b3eing in the modern times .""the discovery of the century"" as some people would refer.. well, I think If Gargoyles were real that would blast Dinosaurs out of the water. ( I am a dnosaur lover btw).granted , they aren't dumb animals and they have Human intelligence and the ability to speak to humans . like my buddy birdygirl said ( Hi Sharifu!!!*waves*) they are a mix of animal and human qualities which makes it so fascniating... that something like this has been right under our noses this whole time.. and we didn't know it.. I love it when it in the episode The Journey: the joggers wonders what these creatures are.. Aliens, Dinosaurs , Demons? I might be wrong about the Dinosuar part(haven't seen the ep in a while) but it 's so cool to learn about the unkown.

It would be neat if they made a Gargoyles movie ( though I prefer animation to live-action ) but we'll see..

like the other fans here I loved how it covered mythology and legends.. I have to admit , I never saw Macbeth the same way again... :lol: .

I surprised my english teacher.. when I told the class that Macbeth had a special ally...a Gargoyle named Demona... and that Macbeth is still alive today ;).

but to keep a long story short. I would love to see Greg and the Gargs back again. there never was a series like Gargoyles before.. and there may never be again... so Get Gargs while you can :)

oh yeah, one of my favorite themes was the Goliath/Elisa relationshp.. Goliath is one lucky Gargoyle  ;)",1097798400,5,2075,4.396866840731071
2129179,5,B0002W4SY0,"I was introduced to Gargoyles when I was twelve, via my younger brother.  I resisted watching at first, sure that no cartoon could be as good as he claimed this was.  But (as difficult as it is to admit your younger brother has done something right <g>), he was absolutely right.

This was not your average cartoon. It did not feature two-dimensional characters and slapstick or vulgar humor. It *did* feature fully-rounded, respectable characters with believable-- if fantastical-- lives and personalities. They were more ""human"" than cartoon characters, if you can apply such a term to a cast of gargoyles, robots, cybots, dragons, aliens, mythic deities, clones, immortals, and Fae.

Gargoyles taught lessons in trust, responsibility, love, integrity, morality, and justice. Due to the mythological and historical content, I learned about Native American, Norse, Irish, Scottish, Australian, and African mythology, folktales, and superstitions. I learned history, Shakespeare, literature, science, even vocabulary. And I loved every minute of it. How many cartoons can claim such a record?

Gargoyles was a show with the perfect blend of elements: action/adventure, character development, romance, magic, adept storytelling, and a serious tone unlike most Disney cartoons. It was the most masterfully crafted cartoon I have ever seen, and the most hypnotically enthralling show to which I have ever had the pleasure of being addicted.

The fans have been trying for a long time to get this series released to DVD, and Disney has finally taken note.  If this set sells well, the second season will almost certainly be released.  If *that* sells well, who knows what could happen?  This is the time to act!

2129180,5,B0002W4SY0,"It's a long time since I've seen Gargoyles, but I remember being a big fan of the show. It took me some time to get into the series because I wasn't able to catch it right at the beginning when it first aired. Fortunately through reruns I was able to piece everything together, and was hooked. This is a show not just for kids. There's a bundle of literary references throughout the show including Shakespeare and the legends of King Arthur. Even historical mysteries such as the secret society of the Illuminati also make their way into the show's continuity. The show has fascinating heros in Goliath and his clan and equally fascinating villains. Besides great story elements and a great cast of characters, the show also has great action and drama. It was definitely a very different kind of animated series for the Disney Afternoon line up (a bit darker and more serious) and I'm glad they took the chance with it.",1097798400,4,919,4.644171779141105

2129182,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles is a trilogy if you will involving mythical and literary characters from many sources. I grew addicted to this show back in 97 due to the Shakespearean mythology and down to earth characters. Besides the continuing plot from episode to episode, the characters in this trilogy are exceptionally realistic. They make mistakes just like you and I, but there is no clear line of good or evil. The fact is this is a very unique peace of work that really makes you feel the happiness and pain(trials and tribulations)along with the characters. If you like Shakespearean stuff you'll love this.",1097798400,4,597,4.920792079207921
2129183,5,B0002W4SY0,"When people think of cartoons, they tend to assume that they're ""just for kids"". But that isn't the case sometimes, especially with this show - Gargoyles is much more than that.

I think I can recall the show being listed in TV Guide as an Action Drama, which it is. I think what makes a show good is if it plays with a person's emotions, if it can really make you cry, laugh, sad, happy, etc. You can't really say that about most cartoons nowadays.

The characters and storylines found in this series are just so awesome. Part of what makes it so cool is that the characters have real human emotions even if some of them aren't human.

So, if you're looking for a great show that's not ""just for kids"", then be sure to pick up Gargoyles on DVD!",1097712000,3,745,4.2695035460992905
2129194,5,B0002W4SY0,"I wasn't very old when Gargoyles was released in 1994, in fact I was probably around the target audience at the humble age of 9.  I didn't quite understand everything that was happening, but it still captivated my imagination nonetheless.  I remember getting up very early in the morning to watch Gargoyles on the USA network, all the way until it stopped carrying it much later.  All of the other cartoons that were around at the time, lacked the certain depth that Gargoyles had.  It is probably one of the few cartoon series to ever handle tough issues of tolerence, gun violence, and love in a very human and understandible context.

  Each and every character in Gargoyles was dynamic and had immense depth.  The plot arched and developed overtime, building on the past.  One of the few downsides to Gargoyles was its threaded, overlapping plot, which far into the series could have confused and aliented new viewers.  This is not a problem if you purchase this DVD set.

  The animation and artwork in Gargoyles is very well coordinated.  Backgrounds are very detailed and character motion is very smooth and emotional.  It, graciously, does not have character motion that is overly suggestive or exaggerated, as many cartoons of the time had.  Character tones, colors, and lighting are also consistent.

  Overall, Gargoyles is one of the most powerful cartoons from the 90's, possessing a depth that defies its origins.  It starkingly reminds me of well executed Anime series, combinding brilliant art with deep concepts that do not impead the progression, or the enjoyment of the series.  Gargoyles greatly enriched my life when I first encountered it in gradeschool, and is deep enough to be something I can enjoy watching today.",1097625600,7,1739,4.96875

The best animated series finally coming to DVD.  I was a loyal fan back when it was running and tried my best to tape the episodes in the late 90's but saddly lost many of the episodes.  Going through some old tapes last year with my nephew I ran into some episodes, now I'm a 30+ year old woman and my nephew got hooked just on my telling him about the characters.  He decided to watch some episodes with me and needless to say I got him full blown hooked on them.  Now he loves the Gargoyles like every good boy should and he will go nuts when I surprise him this christmas with his own copy of the first season of the best animated series ever.

2129200,5,B0002W4SY0,"There was a small window of time, before reality TV and manufactured teen idols, when creators were allowed to create.  One of the offsprings of this archaic golden age was Disney's Gargoyles.

 Walking the path of Batman:  The Animated Series and opening the door for Roughnecks:  The Starship Troopers Chronicles and the like, it stands as the pinnacle of after-school entertainment (or any other type).

 Accessible to children and geared toward an older audience, Gargoyles used epic storylines and a developed cast of characters to keep the attention of its demographic.

 Clean, intricate artwork combined with a powerful score and talented voice actors make this series one that should not be passed up.

 This collection is reported to include all thirteen episodes, uncut.

 With that in mind, ""Deadly Force"" should still deliver the original impact that got it pulled from syndication and the artwork of the Manhattan skyline in the early nineties' should remain untouched.

 So set aside six and a half hours.  Because once you start, the second season won't come fast enough.  That's the one that will help you ace your Macbeth exam.  It's even better than Cliffs Notes.",1097452800,3,1182,5.099476439790576

I thought it would be something that I wouldn't like, made for little boys, like Power Rangers.  Boy was I wrong.  (I'm a 19 year old girl!)  Believe me, this is not a show made just for kids, actually, I think most Gargoyles fans are teens and college students!  I remember turning on the Disney Afternoon, and Gargoyles was on.  I started watching it, and I was amazed.  I was watching how these Gargoyles moved, it amazed me, so animal like, yet very human.  I really got hooked to this show.  A dramatic series, that seemed real.  All the characters seemed very real to me.  I remember when I was younger, I was actually sad that these beautiful noble creatures were not real.  Lol.  Also now that I am older, I really appreciate this show more.  I love the mythology.  The writing on this show was excellent.  Wonderful voice acting, and beautiful animation.  (For most of the episodes)  I really do miss this show...  My dream someday is to have it back on the air, with new episodes.  Of course, Greg Weisman has to come back and work on the series.  I really do think, that because of him, the series was so good.  He's a great story teller.  Gargoyles is my favorite TV Show, and to tell you the truth, I don't think any TV show will replace it, ever.

Thank you Disney for releasing this DVD!  Buy this DVD on December 7 everyone!  We must show Disney how many people really do love this show!  And if you never seen this show, buy the DVD anyways!

I had grown up on Disney afternoon cartoons and expected this to be another ""cookie-cutter"" cartoon....I was dead wrong.  From the opening title encircled in flames I could tell this wasn't a normal show.  The heroes are from a different time and place, one of their biggest foes was one of their own, and they are charged with protecting a city that fears them...in short, this isn't your parents' Disney show.

The writing was top notch and almost felt like it was geared towards adults.  The characters were believable and went through daily struggles in every episode.  There was action, drama, comedy, romance, history, mythology, betrayal, revenge, friendship...something for everyone.  Kids will love it for the humor and action; parents won't argue (and might enjoy it more than the kids) for the huge story, history, morals...Shakespeare.

Don't let this great show slip away.  Order the first season so Disney will see the interest and release Season 2...trust me, if you haven't seen the show, it only gets better.",1097366400,9,1108,5.0109289617486334

It also succeeded in having a continuing storyline and developing characters, when dealing with regular children's programming, this is a miracle in itself.

So, give this volume 1 set a try. I have to confess that one disappointment I have with this set is that it doesn't have a full eightteen episodes rather than just thirteen. My favorite tale, ""Vows"" won't be included until volume 2. So that collection I'm really looking forward to.

If this sets sells, hopefully we'll have volume 2, and Disney may consider releasing DVD's of their other animated series.

When it started coming on ABC Saturday Mornings, I couldn't see it anymore because my local ABC station decided to play four hours of local news instead of cartoons.  Anyway, I tuned in again over the years to whatever station it was on.  USA, The Disney Channel, and most recently ABC Family.  (We don't get Toon Disney).  When they stopped showing it on ABC Family about 3 weeks ago I was once again devastated.  Especially since they only had one episode to go to finish the second season!  I can't wait to get this set on December 7th!  But more importantly I can't wait to get the complete Second Season.  It is one of the greatest seasons of any show in television history.

It's a children's show, of course, but it's the sort of children's show you simply don't see on TV anymore: an intelligent one. And I don't mean just the references to Shakespeare and mythology, though they're plenteous. But Gargoyles is one of the few television shows that doesn't talk down to children and teach morals in broad, sweeping statements when the main character looks to the screen and says ""Y'know, I learned something today"". Characters are realistic, not completely good or evil, they evolve throughout the series and interact normally.

This is the sort of show that has something for people of all ages, and as lame as that sounds, it's true. It's a great family show, it has action, but not gratiutous violence, and asks some heavy questions. There's a great musical score, a group of outstanding actors, writers, and directors, and all of their hard work absolutely shows. The DVD itself has the first season and a lot of interesting extras, it's well priced, so please pick it up on December 7th, I know I will be.

Not only is it suitable for children, but it is perfectly suitable for adults. I was just a young one when it first aired but even now, eight years after my beloved Gargoyles was cancelled, I still retain the things I learned from it. Funny to say, I learned my code of honour from this little cartoon, and I learned the best of what I know from it.

Not only is the show packed full of adventure, loveable characters, and drama, it teaches people - young and old - how to imagine. So many mythological figures appeared in this show, and a lot of people I've met became interested in such fantasy only after they watched Gargoyles. It teaches about Shakespeare, the fay, science of today and what it can be capable of in the future... and it makes it all believable.

But the characters are my favourite. Very fleshed out, powerful in their own ways, and to me they were more lifelike than any other characters in any other show I've ever watched.

I can't wait until season one is out. It'd be a treat to see this show again in all it's glory.",1096761600,5,1236,4.407894736842105
2129217,5,B0002W4SY0,"This is a great show for both young and old.

The show has a great story line to teach about Shakespeare mythology while incorporating its own made up mythology that is fun to get into and follow along.  It's not too difficult that most teens understand the story lines but there are underline stories that most adult will be able to take the stories to a greater understanding.

This is a show where teens and parents can sit down and watch together and have fun conversation afterwards.

I have watched each episode consecutively and it is amazing how well it holds together.  Fascinating storyline and amazingly entertaining, this was one of my favorite cartoons when I first saw it in 1994 (when I was 13) but I enjoyed it even more watching through it when I was 23.  The show is so fruitful because it deals with real issues.  Sure, it's entertaining, but it also confronts predjudice, asks us to examine our values and offers a prototype for virtue in the dynamic character of Goliath, who grows throughout the series despite possessing great wisdom at the start.  The interplay of magic and technology throughout causes viewers to question an overreliance on either method of viewing the world.  Further, the diverse encounters the gargolyes face, and the character development revealed through these trials, offer a unique view of growth in a complex society portrayed masterfully by skillfull and insightful writers.  I certainly hope the rest of the series becomes available in addition to these exquisite first episodes.",1096675200,6,1171,5.036269430051814
2129219,5,B0002W4SY0,"This show had it all:  Aback story, interesting characters, and a universe that never stopped expanding.

Every episode of the show was a new adventure that either introduced characters, expanded on or deepend existing characters.

Sure, during the second season there was a lull in the episodes where Only three gargs were shown, but this only served to stregthen and expand the Gargoyles Universe.

The villians were SO well developed; each character has their own personality; no one stayed static for very long because they all had there own episode.

Each episode was connected to the next one; the story was an ever continuing saga and it's a CRYING SHAME that GARGOYLES ended the way it gig becuse this show could have out lasted the Price is Right. SERIOUSLY.

I LOVE SHAKESPEARE. I owe it ALL to Gargoyles and their stating the play title, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. I would not have learnt to love the 448 year old genius that is Shakespeare if not for Gargoyles.  Gargoyles brought so much into my life: literature, history, geography...

2129221,5,B0002W4SY0,"'Gargoyles' was one of the few shows that Disney created that was meant for a more mature crowd. It had everything that anyone could want, from superb animation, exciting storylines that tied all the episodes together, guest voices (mostly from the Star Trek series), a mixture of themes from fantasy and romance, to comedy and sci-fi, and yet still somehow managed to tie it altogether.",1096588800,,387,4.969230769230769
2129222,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles is an astounding achievement in television animation. It contains a 65 episode arc of a story so rich in details, so layered, so methodically planned and tied together so well, you'll wonder why it isn't better known.

Gargoyles is the story of a clan of Gargoyles led by the noble Goliath. In the year 994A.D. the gargoyles protected Castle Wyvern in Scotland. They were betrayed by the very humans they had sworn to protect, frozen in stone by a magic spell for a thousand years. Centuries later in Manhattan the spell is broken and they LIVE AGAIN! Here they must adjust to their new surroundings and the fact that they are the only six gargoyles in existance (or ARE they?). They meet a new friend and gain some dangerous enemies and are often forced to work with people they can't nessescarily trust.

Gargoyles is a time-spanning epic that feautures mythological creatures, Arthurian legends, a threat from outer space, gargoyle clones, animal hybrid mutates, REAL Shakespearian characters, magic and sorcery, time travel, gang wars, and Secret Societies. It is both an adventure and a romance.

Gargoyles was cancelled by Disney after reaching 65 episodes and fans have been trying to get it back on the air with new episodes, unsuccessfully for years. But you can help. By purchasing this wonderful DVD with the first thirteen episodes and selected commentary you can send Disney the message that high quality animation should not be limited to a set episode count. That creativity and imagination should dictate where a series should go, not bean-counters. Added Bonus: If the sets sell well maybe some of your other Disney Afternoon favorites will make it to DVD if Disney sees there is a market for them. Buy this two-disc set, and let them LIVE AGAIN!",1096502400,6,1773,4.923076923076923
2129223,5,B0002W4SY0,"It's hard to say something that has not already been said about Gargoyles.

The series reached a level of complexity and maturity unmatched by many, and is the best example of risk-taking that Disney ever displayed for a TV series.

You get some of the best animation for a TV series in America, excellent voice-actors who truly gave life to their characters, multiple story arcs with recap before each episodes to allow anyone not familiar to the show to just jump in whatever story is currently showing, non-cliched three-dimensional characters and themes rarely used in an animated series that's partially adressed to children.

I applaud Disney for taking a chance in releasing the first season on DVD, I hope it allows many people who missed it to discover this gem of american animation.",1096502400,4,793,4.947368421052632

It brings to life characters such as MacBeth, Puck, Oberon, Titania, and takes you from modern-day Manhattan to medieval Europe, Avalon, and Ireland; even the possible future our heroes face. It provides excellent voice acting by well-known personalities such as Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, and John Rys Davies; and that's only a few. The animation is beautiful and flowing.

2129227,5,B0002W4SY0,"In the early 90's, two cartoons premiered which were like nothing I'd seen before. Ground-breaking, beautiful, dramatic, and more than I ever expected. One of those was Batman: The Animated Series. The other was Gargoyles.

Gargoyles had everything. Drama, action, comedy, romance, and, most of all, fantasy on a glorious, majestic, epic scale. The show got me hooked right from the beginning with the opening sequence. Mystical creatures from medieval times, frozen in stone by a magic spell, and brought to modern-day Manhattan. Unfortunately, describing it doesn't do it justice. All I can say is that watching it, with the beautiful animation and the narration (with Keith David's gravelly voice), literally gave me chills, and that's a rare event.

The show itself lived up to the promise of its title sequence. There were complex plots that developed from episode to episode, detailed characterizations, and subtle relationships. There was also plenty of action and excitement, and more than a few big surprises. Along the way, the show even managed to touch on the mythology of a wide variety of cultures.

There was more to it than I knew you could put into *any* show, let alone a weekday afternoon Disney cartoon.

Unfortunately, it ended all too soon. At least now, with the release of the DVD, fans can enjoy it once more.

For more info about the show, check out some of the fan sites. [...] is a good place to start, since it was set up specifically to help promote this DVD.",1096416000,7,1489,4.892857142857143
2129228,5,B0002W4SY0,"Wow. Has it really been 10 years since this show first aired? Makes me feel old as dirt. Well, stone, anyway. Eh, enough with the bad jokes, on with the review.

Gargoyles is certainly a different approach from Disney's usually exclusively kid-friendly shows. It is a show for ALL ages. Things were said, and things happened on the average kid level, as well as on a slightly more mature level. I remember watching the premier episodes and thinking ""wow, this looks pretty darn good. Wait a minute, this is Disney???....Cool!""

Gargoyles is Disney's best animated series, not only because of the VERY original premise, but because the stories never ended. What happened in one episode would have a consequence in another episode, and another. Characters' relationships would change. The Gargoyles' entire situation would change.

Not only does this series stand out because of the storylines, but also because of the animation. Put it this way: Gargoyles most mediocre animation is better than most series' best. With superb animation and an excellent story, Gargoyles was a force to be reckoned with. It may have been a while since we've seen anything new from Goliath and company, but, to me anyway, the legacy of the Gargoyles will last ""as old as the mountain stone.""",1096329600,12,1271,4.985849056603773
2129229,5,B0002W4SY0,"What originally piqued my interest back in 1994 were the fantastical elements of the show--mythical creatures, magic, medieval settings... but what got me HOOKED was the brilliant, flowing storyline and beautiful animation.  Though the fantastical elements were still there as the series progressed, these took a backseat to the characters and their development as they adjusted to the modern world and each other, and by this time you have grown so attached to the cast that their interactions are enough to drive the entire story.  And yet there continues to be wonderful stories woven through the background of the episodes, many exploring the origins of ancient myths and legends, or the characters of Shakespeare's plays, or even reminding us of the repercussions of gun control, deforestation, and illiteracy (but these lessons are never shoved down your throat; rather they are told in a way that makes you THINK).  Children will be drawn as I was by the colorful ""cool"" creatures, and yet as they watch these episodes, they will be exposed to such wonderful stories that they will surely begin to appreciate it--as many adults now do--as a masterful work of art and plot.",1096329600,5,1179,5.06701030927835

2129245,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles, for its all too brief run on TV, was the pinnacle of Disney animation on television. And it wasn't just beautiful art and superb voice direction that made this series amazing- it was a storyline with such complexity and balance that you'd never imagine it was aimed at children.

But Gargoyles succeeded with both children and adults- it always brandished its dichotomy with skill and finesse. Shakespearean plots worked alongside puns and sight gags, all aimed to keep every single viewer bound up in the fascinating and often thought-provoking mythos of the Gargoyles.

This DVD is the first chance Gargoyles fans have had to own these episodes since their original VHS release in 1996, and if this set sells well, Disney is sure to provide us with the chance to buy the even more amazing Second season!

I always watched it at her house. After it moved off of the stations that I got I fell out of tune with my Gargoyle side, but early this year it finally came on a channel I did get and so I began to watch it again and record it this time. But, just last week they stopped and left me hanging at Hunter's Moon Pt 2. I was pratically devestated. So now I hope that Seasons Two and Three come on DVD because I am desperately wanting to see Hunter's Moon Pt 3 and what comes afterwards. Gargoyles brought me into a world of fantasy and magic and has forever influenced my thinking. I cannot deem a dragon as an evil creature, I cannot think of a world without magical creatures, and I have always found a respect for things that many people deem as dark and sinister. All this is because of Gargoyles and if we take this away from people, who can't get it on its regular channels, then we are taking away a great blessing that can be bestowed on future generations. If we can just reach another person the way that I have been reached by Gargoyles then that is good enough for me.",1095897600,8,1242,4.179166666666666

REVIEW POST DVD COMING OUT:

It's been ten years since Gargoyles came out on TV and the fandom is still going strong. Why? Becasue this show was sensational. It was a phenomenon like no other, and it deserves to be remembered. I was estatic to find out that Gargoyles Season One was coming onto DVD. I bbegged for it for X-Mas, got it, and I could not be any happier with the product.

The first thirteen episodes of Gargoyles shine now like they did back then- with a life that cannot be matched by any cartoon today. The passion of the fans and the people who worked on the show shows in EVERY scene. The characters are not animated cells, they are real people. There is nothing that can match the sheer quality this show had to offer, and kids and adults alike could enjoy it.

The extra features on the DVD were great as well. It was interesting to see how the shpow evolved from the original show pitch, and heartening to see scenes from The Gathering (the annual comic-con like get together of the Gargoyles fandom). This show has lasted well beyond its original shpowing. It has inspiried mmy writing and drawing and that of many others. This is something I would reccomend you get your kids. It will teach them not only life lessons about friendship, but is a crash course in mythology and Shakespeareian plays. Intellectually stimulating, but never boring, Gargoyles will forever be in my heart as one of the highlights of my childhood.

I only hope that Diseny will see the response of hte fans and perhaps realize the mistake they made in taking the show off the air. Even if it is impossible to put it on, or to make a new series, it is my hope that they come out with the other seasons of Gargoyles. I would love to have all the episodes saved to show to my children sometime in the far future.

This is a DVD worth every penny of what you pay, and it will give you back more than you expected.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Every day after school there was one show I had to watch. Based in myth and lore this show literally changed my life. I loved Gargoyles with all my heart, and it influences my art and my writing today. The show was inspiring, well done, and I was infuriated when it was taken off the air. Disney made a huge mistake in doing so.

I encourage anyone who hasn't experienced the phenomena that was gargoyles to pick this up. It's great for children and adults alike, had great lessons, and ties in Shakespere's work, and all sorts of other Myths: Norse, Native American, Asian. . . It's educational and entertaining.

For all you old time gargoyles fans, I plead that you buy season one on December 7th, so we can prove to Disney that they should bring the show back.",1095897600,,2751,4.397637795275591
2129249,5,B0002W4SY0,"Gargoyles has been a favourite of mine since I first saw it in 1996 and will always have a special place in my heart.

Nowadays, with the usual TV show (animated or otherwise) ranging from dumb to not funny, ""Gargoyles"" is a breath of fresh air. Very well done, compeling, funny, action-packed and incredibly smart, this is a show for all ages.

Here's hoping Buena Vista will hear fans wishes and not only release the rest of the series but give us International fans a chance to acquire this gem as well.

Come on, suits, start planning other Regions' releases! We need a Region 4 ""Gargoyles"" set down here in Brazil!",1095724800,9,568,4.785714285714286
2129252,5,B0002W4SY0,"Finally, what we have all been waiting for. This is one of Disney's most underrated feets of animation and storytelling to date. This wasn't a show for just kids. My parents would watch this with me when I was a kid, and now I share it with my 5 year old daughter. It's one of those very few and rare programs that the whole family can truely enjoy. And it deals with real world issues such as prejudice and gun safety. But in such a way that it isn't sugar coated, but it isn't anime-graphic either.

But in this case, it's really true.  Kids, adults, science fiction fans, fantasy lovers, Shakespeare devotees, mythology buffs, animation nuts and just about everyone else is bound to find something to love about ""Gargoyles"".  The show's generally strong animation and smart writing that never talks down to its audience, whatever age they may be, make it something truly special.

2129264,5,B0002W4SY0,"I just found out that Gargoyles is going to be on DVD Dec. 7th, and I am so excited!!!  I remember the first time I watched it: I was eight years old, and I instantly had new heroes.  They replaced Power Rangers in about two seconds!  Even at eight, I recognized that there was an actual plot with deeper meanings than any of the other kids' shows on television.  It captivated me, and helped me understand human relationships before any of my friends had matured.  Ironic, isn't it, that a cartoon helped make me think like an adult?

  We used to pretend that we were Gargoyles out on the playground, and I always wanted to be Goliath.  That is, until I realized that he was carrying around so much emotional baggage, and then I was fine with being Lexington, lol.  I didn't feel like putting up with Demona's PMS.

  But the point is, this show had a significant impact on my childhood, and it still affects my life today.  I have longed to attend the Gathering, and every year, I check the updates to see how it went.  I still wear my Gargoyles T-shirts from when I was nine (I am rather small), and I even my email addy is based on the show!  I have written Disney before to ask them to please, PLEASE, either make a live action movie or release Gargoyles on DVD, and I am so genuinely thrilled that they are finally doing so...although I still say a live action movie would be awesome!

  So, please, everyone who likes Gargoyles, buy this set!!!  We have to show Disney that we still love our Angels of the Night!!! ~Nick",1095724800,11,1528,4.351063829787234
2129265,5,B0002W4SY0,"What can I say that others haven't said before me? Not much, to tell the truth, so I'll just go with my experiances.

I watched Gargoyles from the very first moment it appeared on Australian television. I watched, and loved, every episode. I even forgave the station for messing up the screening order and leaving out episodes, because so long as there was Gargoyles to watch, it was enough.

Gargoyles is one of the great loves of my life. Not just because of the wonderful writing, excellent acting, innovative use of myth, history and legend, or even the great cast. But also because of what it has done for me, personally.

When I found the fandom alive and well on the 'net a few years back, I rejoyced - here were others like myself, fans of the show and proud of it.

Because of Gargoyles I have made new friends, made my first (but not last) trip overseas, went ot my first Con and may even appear on the special features of the DVD (shield your eyes children!).

If you have fond memories of the show, or are just looking for a quality animated series that aims ot be morethan just a 'saturday morning kids cartoon' then I urge you to buy the DVD. You might just help revive a wonderful story.",1095638400,7,1202,4.396396396396397
2129266,5,B0002W4SY0,"Let me say first off that I'm nowhere near the nominal target market of ""Gargoyles."" I'm not male, I'm a whole lot older than the preteen demographic to which the show was ostensibly marketed, and I'm not necessarily an action/adventure fan.

And I got hooked on this series in no time flat.

I can't think of very many series -- either animated or live-action -- that are complex enough to run the gamut of genres, from action to history to romance to humor, and do each one well. Also, how refreshing it is to watch any series -- let alone a so-called ""kids' show"" -- that portrays adult characters as, amazingly enough, *adults,* each with his/her own strengths, weaknesses, foibles, and individual personalities. And how many cartoons can you name off the top of your head that even *mention* Shakespeare, let alone incorporate references to his works (and spur hordes of youngsters to start reading them as a result)?

Naturally, the appeal for younger viewers is there. The series is animated by some of the best talent Disney had to offer during its 1990s golden age of 2-D animation, and the eye candy is generous indeed. The colors are lush, the motion fluid, and the detail striking. The action is brisk; battles are waged, and explosions occur in duly spectacular fashion. It has its moments of violence, so I would *not* recommend it for very young children. But target-market viewers of either gender should be enthralled.

The show's appeal by no means stops here. Viewers of high-school age are sure to appreciate many of the show's other aspects, such as its references to classic literature and its fearless treatment of salient social issues such as gun violence, prejudice, and personal responsibility. Beyond this, college-age viewers are likely to focus more on the philosophical debate of these and other issues that the series touches upon in deftly allegorical fashion, such as the definition of sentient life and its inherent rights, and the challenges involved in adhering to one's principles. And older folks like me are likely to step back a little, view the entire series as the large-canvas work of art that it is, and simply marvel at the care and integrity of its creators, and the beauty they have created.

If you see this DVD and think, ""I remember 'Gargoyles;' that was a great series,"" here's your chance to relive those days. If you're wondering from these reviews how a mere Disney cartoon can be so many things to so many people, here's your chance to find out. If your youngster expresses interest in this DVD, sit down and watch it with him/her. This is a valuable, important, talent-laden series for the ages, and for everyone. Its underlying messages are edifying and timeless. It's a series that the entire family not only can enjoy watching together, but can enjoy discussing as well -- each and every episode.

And how valuable is that?",1095552000,11,2883,4.849593495934959

Gargoyles was a stunning series that was truly perfect for all ages to watch. It was such a beautiful blend of drama, humor, adventure, stunning animation, amazing story-telling and a great cast of voice actors. The fan base for this series has stayed very strong, and now that it is almost ten years later...there is a whole new fanbase just waiting to be treated to Gargoyles. I have no doubt the sales for this DVD will be quite fantastic!

This DVD is most certainly a must for any fan of the Gargoyles' series, or just any who wants to be treated to a masterpeice series. A great series and a great DVD for everyone!",1095552000,7,799,4.355704697986577

2129269,5,B0002W4SY0,"Finally! Disney has produced an animated series that can be appreciated by people of all ages, not just those with a short attention span.  ""Gargoyles"" has it all.  Add to that a talented voice cast, including many from the Star Trek franchise.  Many will recognize Jonathan Frakes (Riker) as billionaire, David Xanatos and Marina Sirtis (Counselor Troi) as the vengeful gargoyle, Demona.  Michael Dorn (Worf) makes an appearance as the cyborg gargoyle, Coldstone in the episode ""Reawakening.""  I really hope they come out with Season 2.

2129270,5,B0002W4SY0,"After having first seen Gargoyles nearly 10 years ago during the Disney Afternoon days of after-school TV, I became an instant fan. Gargoyles was, and still is, THE MOST UNIQUE AND TOTALLY ORIGINAL cartoon saga that I have ever seen.

Everything from dynamic characters to stories that span across time to the extremely creative use of Shakespearean themes and Arthurian legend, Gargoyles has much of what modern cartoons and animes lack...simply, the ability to capture an audience spanning across a variation of age groups and keep them interested, craving for more. For no other has pulled me in as such, that to miss a single episode, felt like losing one's most prized possession. Not only that, it teaches lessons for life and sheds light on questionable issues in society and ethics.

I am very delighted to see the series finally being published to DVD! In a world where most cartoons today lack substance, Gargoyles is Disney's finest, ""now and forever.""",1095552000,7,963,5.0125
2129271,5,B0002W4SY0,"I recently discovered Gargoyles about two months ago, but since I fell head over heels with the show. It's absolutely the greatest! Unlike other cartoons, this show has that mystery and drama you see in adult movies and shows. I especially love the way how all the episodes are conected, and will revert back to episodes back in the first season. And of course I love the way you don't have single track-minded villians who want to just blow up the earth, we have complicated villans with purposes and reason for their actions, like Xanatos and Demona. We also have people who you don't know who's side they're on, like Macbeth and Puck and Coldstone. In short, this is the best show I've had the pleasure of watching, and I can't wait for the DVD to come out.",1095552000,8,760,4.5144927536231885
2129272,5,B0002W4SY0,"This show is amazing.  I remember when I was younger I was drawn into the show and absolutely loved it.  Nearly a decade later I have rekindled my love for the show and rediscovered its complexity and ability to appeal to a diverse group of people - both males and females, both kids and adults.

Its too bad the show was cancelled after two seasons (three if you count The Goliath Chronicles) and I hope that people will remember this show and go out and buy the DVD in multitudes, not only getting the rest of the series out on DVD but perhaps bringing the show back?",1095465600,7,569,4.299065420560748
2129273,4,B0002W4SY0,"Because for a show that improves by leaps and bounds over the

course of its' two seasons, one must show a little restraint in

rating from one season to the next.  'Gargoyles' was originally

introduced in 1994 and while you might have missed seeing or

hearing about it the first time around, now is your chance to

find out why it is I am writing only my second review for

amazon.com after being a loyal customer for over 7 years--- I

just flat out believe in this show that much.  Why does it get

so much better?  Mainly due to the first season acting as a

springboard for the character developments and story arcs to

branch out into what has become the Gargoyles universe.  Season

1 episodes are very self-contained in that the characters,

stories, locations, relationships, etc. are introduced but not

followed up on and there is a reason for that.  A first time

viewer should have a dozen questions on why certain events or

dialogue just doesn't add up.  This is because 'Gargoyles' turns

into a full blown soap opera over the next 50-some odd episodes

following season 1 but every show has to start somewhere.

Which leads us to what makes 'Gargoyles' such a rare gem of a

series altogether.  Well, the things that do not change over

the course of two seasons are the quality of animation, the

ambitious Carl Johnson score, the high level of voice acting

by nothing short of an A-list cast, and the strong writing which

is so intricate in how it pays attention to detail and weaves

so many characters, stories, and dramatic arcs into one larger

picture, that words cannot truly do it justice unless one has

actually seen for themselves what it is I am trying to describe.

In closing, animation in and of itself is just like any other

medium we watch or listen to in that there is good, and bad, and

a lot of in between.  Sometimes we have to watch 9 bad movies

to find that 'Gone With The Wind' or 'The Wizard Of Oz' that

makes it all worth going out of our way to do.  'Gargoyles' is

a very rare breed of show that blends the best qualities of any

movie or television show you have seen, and spreads it over 65

episodes to tell one huge, long, never ending story.  You have

the opportunity to witness how it all got started with the 13

episode season 1 boxed set of 'Gargoyles' and I assure you it is

an opportunity that you do not want to miss this time around.",1095465600,8,2402,4.391304347826087
2129284,5,B0002W4SY0,"This is by far the best series that Disny; let alone other companies has ever created. This show has Action, Drama, suspense and even love condensed into 30 minute segments. Do not bee fooled. This isn't just some kids tv show. There is a long story arc that introduces the veiwer to new worlds and rewards them with suprises. All the characters constantly evolve and change for the better or the worst. I just hope that others like me will get the chance to get the rest of this Masterpiece in the coming moths after season one. I do not have the words to explain how this ""kids"" show has entertained and touched me with its story telling.",1095465600,7,640,4.432203389830509
2129285,5,B0002W4SY0,"I spent a lot of time & money trying to get the entire series on VHS. I'm glad I did because that was 6 years ago, and it would've been a shame to go this long without being able to watch some of these episodes! This show stands as one of the top 2 cartoons of the '90's in terms of storytelling, next to Batman The Animated Series. Not surprising, because both shows have episodes written by the same writers!

Definitely a show that Disney should've thrown more support behind. But this DVD release is a good start! So if you like Gargoyles, buy this set when it comes out! Especially ON THE RELEASE DATE, Dec. 7, 2004! That's the only way the Powers That Be are gonna know there's enough of a fanbase (AND THERE IS) to keep Gargoyles product coming!

What's my personal stake in this? Simple: I WANT SEASON 2 ON DVD!! And that ain't gonna happen unless this set takes off!! Season 2 alone is 52 episodes, peeps! That 3 or 4 seasons for some shows, and not even good shows at that!

I'm a child of the '80's and as much as I love classic shows like Transformers and Thundercats, they just aren't as WELL-WRITTEN as Gargoyles. Don't get me wrong, I own the entire Transformers series on VHS, DVD, and even LASERDISC(?!?!), but ya gotta give credit where it's due! I've got a fever! And the only prescription is more Gargoyles!",1095465600,15,1327,4.364372469635628
2129286,5,B0002W4SY0,"""Gargoyles"" is not your average animated cartoon show.  It is literally unlike any other North American animated series you have ever seen.  The characters, the story, the plot twists are deep and involving and way beyond any kiddie cartoon.  I first saw it ten years ago, when I was ten years old, and I still to this day I am a loyal fan.  I watch it almost every night on Toon Disney when I can, dispite the fact that I've seen every episode countless times and have every episode on tape.  The way it starts out so simple, yet by the end has evolved into a complex story of adventure, love, and acceptance -- the way the writers wove popular literature and mythology into the world so naturally, especially all the Shakespeare references (and very accurate references, at that) -- the depth of the characters and how they grow and learn throughout the course of the series -- it still leaves me in awe.  Not to mention the breathtaking animation, much of which is far better than that of popular new cartoons today.  Sure, ""Gargoyles"" was originally created for kids (and has many great lessons to be learned from some of the episodes), but I have no doubt that adults would enjoy it as well.  Even if you think fantasy isn't your genre, I recommend giving ""Gargoyles"" a try, you won't be disappointed.",1095379200,7,1306,4.575107296137339
2129287,5,B0002W4SY0,"My brother got me hooked on the reruns earlier this summer.  I thought he was a dork, but it turns out this is one of the most entertaining shows I've ever seen animated or otherwise.  The plot is incredibly deep for what was once an afternoon cartoon and the voice acting is fantastic, especially Keith David as Goliath.  Action packed, filled with drama, humor, and touching friendships, this is a must own DVD.  I can't wait until it comes out.  My only wish is that I watched this show the first time around, although I think as someone who is now 22, I can appreciate it a lot more.

Oh and the theme song is great.  The narration and clips give me goosebumps and get me ready for what's to follow.",1095379200,7,703,4.320610687022901
2129288,5,B0002W4SY0,"This Series has influenced me in more ways than I can elaborate. When I was young (I was 11 when Gargoyles Premiered)I Watched this for the first time. From that time on the plots have haunted me. There is not a day that goes by that my thoughts do not stray back to those stories.

It influenced the way I write. I consistently get A's and B's on College papers because I have the voice and Vocabulary of Goliath to trace.

It changed the way I looked at Cinema(even though it never aired on the big silver screen). I now demand a higher standard in entertainment.

It sparked a curiosity in Mythology, Shakespeare, and Classic literature.

It is one of the Cornerstones of my past and I put it there for a reason. The reason is that the Gargoyles is tied for the best Animated Series I have ever seen(The Transformers is the other one yes Gargoyles is that good).",1095379200,7,865,4.3875
2129289,5,B0002W4SY0,"And where you need to be is here to buy the best animated series DVD boxset to be released. Gargoyles was my favorite animated series of the early to mid 90's.

Unlike other cartoons where villians had simple one track ambitions of taking over the world or used repetative slapstick comedy, Gargoyles gave their villians a gamut of emotions from apathy to honor at times. In the gargoyles universe, good and evil weren't always cut and dry. Much like the real world, there were ocassions where the Gargoyles needed to ally with their enemies to serve the greater good.

With intricate charactor development and detailed plots, Gargoyles plays out more like a great work of theater than a TV series. In fact, many of the charactors introduced through out the series run included: MacBeth, The Weird Sisters, Puck and others from North American, African, and Scottish Legend. Thanks to the great writing and animation of the Gargoyles team, enough background information is presented on all the historical charactors and concepts so that young viewers can understand their signifigance while not insulting the intelligence of older viewers.

Just to give you some idea of how popular the series still is, log onto your favorite search engine and look up gargoyles. I gaurantee you the top hits you'll get are fan sites. Still think it's a kids show? Check your TV listings to see if reruns are airing where you live; watch a few, and when you're hooked, head back here and order the DVD to help ensure that season two will be released.",1095379200,11,1533,4.843511450381679
2129290,5,B0002W4SY0,"Its not just for kids, but they can enjoy it too. It has something for everyone. It's well written. It sparks the imagination. I've been waiting for years for this DVD.. thank Disney it's finally here!",1095292800,8,201,4.611111111111111
2129291,5,B0002W4SY0,"It's funny. When I was a snot-nosed freshman in high school, Gargoyles was part of my after-school routine. I watched the show almost religiously, even going so far as to finding out when favorite episodes would be on again so I could tape them and watch them in my spare time. However, I wasn't terribly sad when the show was cancelled...just disappointed. I suppose it was because I hadn't been satisfied with The Goliath Chronicles that had been airing from September 1996 to early 1997. With the looming responsibilities of college and work, Gargoyles became pushed to the back of my mind, usually coming up only in conversation with people of my age group.

A few months ago, I was flipping through the cable channels late at night (like Goliath and his clan, I've always been more of a night person), when I noticed Gargoyles was being shown on Toon Disney. So I stopped and watched it. Almost immediately, I fell in love with the show all over again. All the fond memories from my school days (my brothers and I coming home from school and plunking down on the couch with chips, salsa, and chocolate milk to see what Goliath and Company would be up to that day) came back to the surface, and I remembered what had made the show so compelling.

So, what is it about Gargoyles, that still makes me love it after almost ten years? First, there's the writing. These are not your typical happy, song-filled Disney characters. These are true warriors from another place, another time, trying to find their way in a world that is not ready to acknowledge their existence. The first thirteen episodes (which will be released on this DVD) introduced us to a very complex and diverse cast of characters. The story in a nutshell is that Goliath was the ruler of a clan of gargoyles (creatures with super-human strength and the ability to glide, who turn to stone when the sun is up) in tenth-century Scotland. They coexisted (rather uneasily) in a castle with a group of humans who for the most part feared and hated them. I won't give away intricate details of the story, but eventually, most of Goliath's clan was smashed through human treachery, and only he and a small handful of others survived, although a spell was cast on them that turned them into stone both day and night. They remained frozen in time until 1,000 years later, when an enterprising billionaire named David Xanatos learned how to break the spell. What's truly amazing is that not only were the characters well-developed, but the storyline conjured up by the writers for the gargoyles living in New York in the 20th Century was intricate, and plausible. The first season set many events in motion that were actually expanded upon in the second! For example, in Episode 9, ""Enter MacBeth,"" there is a moment in the episode when the mysterious character MacBeth (voiced brilliantly by John Rhys-Davies) reveals to Goliath that he named Demona (Goliath's former mate, turned enemy to him and his clan). Normally, such a revelation would have me shaking my head, but in the second season, the writers actually came up with an explanation that kicked ass. Amazingly enough, it also explained Demona's comment in Episode 7, when she told Goliath that ""I always survive.""

The second thing I loved about this show was the voice talent. I don't know how they did it, but Disney somehow assembled a group of actors that fit each character to a T. Goliath is voiced by Keith David, who does an excellent job of making the gargoyle leader sound like a warrior who is weighted by many things: concern over the fate of his clan, confusion at being a stranger in a strange land, and sorrow over the loss of his ""angel of the night,"" Demona, whom he still has feelings for. Other noteworthy casting decisions were Jonathon Frakes as Xanatos, and Ed Asner as Hudson (Goliath's mentor and former leader of the clan).

Since I first learned that Gargoyles has been airing on Toon Disney, I have been trying to catch the show whenever my work schedule will allow it. So needless to say, I was pleased when I heard the first season of Gargoyles will be released on DVD. I can only hope that the second season, which is just as amazing, will follow. I will try to post again after I've actually bought the DVDs, to see how well Disney translated them to disc. But for now, let me just say that I'm pleased that Gargoyles, a show that still speaks as much to me now as it did when I was a child, is finally getting the DVD treatment. I hope that Disney does not diappoint us.",1095292800,10,4523,4.621890547263682
2129292,5,B0002W4SY0,"I remember becoming jaded with American animation in the early nineties. Despite 'growing up' and getting into high school I hadn't 'out grown' this phase of life.  My tastes had evolved, indeed, but animation still held me with its own special magic.  I was about to give up on local shows when I found an ad in Disney Adventures magazine for a new show beginning in the fall called 'Gargoyles.'  It even came with a little comic, and I was immediately hooked, though the show would not be premiering for a few weeks.

There are few animations I can think of that appeal to an audience so diverse.  Gargoyles stretched the quality of animation past its normal parameters for a weekly event.  When I say animation, I don't just mean the way the characters move.  Teams of devoted artists and writers crafted an experience that was beautiful and breathtaking, but daring, dark, cunning and intelligent from animation to story, character development to voice actors, score to scenery.  It is because of this idea to push the limits of what had been done before that Gargoyles appeals to viewers young and old, in any walk of life or career, and why it still has a thriving fan base.

I was drawn into plots that would spread out over tens of episodes, building seemingly inconsequential things upon each other.  I often couldn't believe how excellent the animation was; I was watching this show at home, not in a theater.  It wasn't a Disney movie, but it was the Disney movie experience.  Being able to go back and re-watch episodes is a real treat; connections that were there before, but probably overlooked made me nod and think, ""You clever thing.  You had this in mind all along.""  Gargoyles had smart writers.  Gargoyles had highly skilled artists.  Gargoyles had teams that worked in concert so well everything about the show flowed seamlessly together.  Gargoyles had it all.

Which is why the show appeals to so many.  I still come across people who say, ""Gargoyles? It was one of my favorite shows.""  Or, ""Oh yeah, I remember Gargoyles. It was amazing for a cartoon.""  ""I watched it in college.  I never thought of it as just a kid's show.""  And so on.

Here I finally have the chance to own a high quality set of the first amazing season that got Gargoyles started.  I've been waiting for this opportunity for years. I can only hope Disney sees the great potential Gargoyles once again has, and releases the rest of the series on DVD (and perhaps with new episodes to boot!).",1095292800,14,2485,4.657471264367816
2129293,5,B0002W4SY0,"From 1994-1996, ""Gargoyles"" occupied the top spot among the animated series' of its day. Though Disney marketed the show for young boys 7-11, its rich animation, well-conceived plot arcs and talented voice cast entertained viewers far beyond that demographic. Its themes ranged from comic to sobering, each episode had a unique quality while playing to a larger plot and fans continue to sing its praises to this day. Disney truly had a hit in ""Gargoyles,"" and its legacy continues on now 10 years since it first hit television screens.

This first season DVD contains some of the series' finest episodes, including the highly acclaimed yet controversial ""Deadly Force,"" an episode which targets both children and adults as a sobering lesson in gun ownership - and far beyond anything a contemporary show managed to accomplish - that until recently was not aired in the U.S. That episode along with many others in the series speaks to one of many themes of ""Gargoyles"" - teaching without preaching. As well as being an animated series, the creators of the show sought to educate their intended audience instead of producing mere action and inconsistent plots, and they accomplished that task without condescending overtones or preached lessons. And educational values aside, the show introduces mythological and Shakespearean elements that provide richness beyond the show's immediate plot points.

But an animated series is nothing without its cast, and the cast in this DVD provides a superior talent which brings to life the characters of the show in a way almost unmatched. Included in its ranks are Keith David, Marina Sirtis, Jonathan Frakes, Ed Asner, Bill Fagerbakke and John Rhys-Davies. The many Star Trek notables fit into their roles perfectly - even if a few are playing the villains, e.g. Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis - but the entire cast shows talent one would expect from quality shows and the big screen.

When you watch ""Gargoyles,"" you often forget that you are watching a show originally intended for children, as its depth and rich animation transcend the shows most often associated with young children; you are not watching a mere cartoon with ""Gargoyles,"" you are watching an animated drama. The creators of ""Gargoyles"" developed something truly unique in their field - in Disney and animation in general - and it is unfortunate that their model has not caught on and that ""Gargoyles"" suffered the fate of cancellation.

Whether you're a fan of Star Trek and looking for cast-related memorabilia, an old ""Gargoyles"" fan looking for nostalgia, or a parent wanting something new for your children, this DVD is for you and for so many more. ""Gargoyles"" remains a classic series, superior to many shows of its day and those which have come along since, and this is a DVD you will be proud to have in your collection.",1095292800,9,2842,5.0276008492569
