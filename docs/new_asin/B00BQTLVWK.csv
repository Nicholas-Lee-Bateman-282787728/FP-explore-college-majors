5667231,5,B00BQTLVWK,"Documentary has fantastic footage from the early sixties possibly before, and it is superbly put together with one of the best editing jobs I have ever seen in any genre.  Takes you right back to the birth of a legendary band, and shows some warts so is not a total white wash.  Some of the old interviews are priceless.  A must watch.  It got 92% on Rotten Tomatoes, which it deserved.",1363910400,14,386,4.394366197183099
5667232,5,B00BQTLVWK,I loved this documentary!! i love the fact the interviewer recorded their voices even though the Stones refused to be on camera - great touch of having their own words be the voiceover.  I've watched plenty of documentaries of The Stones and this particular one had footage i had never seen and it was really well done.  HBO i feel has some of the best documentaries and they did not disappoint.  A must-see for any Stones fan!,1363478400,21,427,4.51948051948052

5667236,5,B00BQTLVWK,"At this point, I am guaranteed to consider the Stones my favorite band of all time until my dying day. For Jagger and Richards especially, there is a solid 15 years or so I am fascinated by, as they experienced going from teenager to their 20s in the 1960s, then 20-something's who turned 30 and on and on during the 1970s as they blasted forward.
Hbo put this out a few years back, and I only just watched it. ""Crossfire Hurricane"" that proves to be highly entertaining to watch, more so than I imagined it would.  If you have the same affection for them as people and are just as influenced musically as me, then I say with a good degree of confidence you will enjoy it as much too.  It sucks you in and if you watch it on one of those days where boredom with the routine strikes, and it will, you lose your self awareness as you give this doc your full attention. That it is hilarious, joyful, sad at times, even mind-boggling, is to be expected, that's a given. What is unexpected is that you didn't realize you would feel awestruck once again by what you thought you already knew.  There may be some exaggerations, embellishments in the story telling by the main characters themselves, but this doesn't change the story, in fact it makes it more real, and comical.  It's easy to separate the facts from the details which are added  on for extra enjoyment.  The compiling of footage, the course the story takes, the narratives by band members, and great choice in different cuts from familiar tracks on the albums are carefully selected to emphasize a moment in time.  One reason I follow the careers of rock legends is because it's so hard to imagine what things would be like if I could live that life during that time the way they did.  One must wonder if once things got to a certain point, could they ever turn back and leave the music business?  I think no - it was go on and try to survive, and keep going, and expect nothing ordinary, nor attempt to comprehend the concept of ordinary.  And with that comes the underlying theme of the Rolling Stone's journey:  While they chose to be musicians, they never chose the things that came as they skyrocketed to international stardom, and they were an unstoppable force, a train that left the station without a destination and no way to change tracks, slow down, stop, and especially return to the beginning. Driving this train was their commitment to music but so many other things which were external, be it a relentless press, profit-driven music executives, or the stresses the universe put on them - were all catalysts that ensured them tremendous success, baffling obstacles, pure joy, a movement of inspired artists in their trail, and stories of both love and heartbreak.  I recommend the f*** out of this movie, it gives you an authentic account of the evolution which occurred as they grew artistically, while trying (in vain) to live some semblance of a life which could promise them any lasting peace, stability or security in years to come.
However, this volatile existence was the edge which fueled so much of their creative output. They struggled to find effective ways to deal with fame, arrests, tabloids.. Keeping routines, managing relationships, and planning for the future were things that that I doubt came naturally or were even comprehended by the Rolling Stones or any band of their caliber who became famous so young.  This movie suggests that ""Normal"" meant chaos, destruction, darkness, drugs and uncertainty. Happiness was music, privilege at every turn, collaborating on new songs, and sharing that music with the world.  Comforts came behind the scenes, and drug use and abuse is very synonymous with The Rolling Stones themselves.  The comfort their inner circle could only provide: the ones who shared the experience within the band and just around them - this circle was always small.  Naturally this is why they lived as brothers, a gang, in a way.  It's the bond that held them together while so many external factors were constantly trying to pull them apart.  You start to understand the strength it took to just live their lives, as this bond is portrayed as time and again preventing the destruction that felt could be around the corner at any turn.  The film shows a new layer of their multi-dimensional personalities and Keith and Mick's (at times) limitless ability to create the most honest, stripped down, and timeless music in Rock n Roll. They were themselves at all times, this was constant, and like their instruments amplified their personalities both on stage and screen.  There are narrations by Jagger and Richards throughout much of the movie, adding to the authenticity.  A Stones doc isn't anything new, nor is a concert film or album.  Due to the continuous coverage they got over the years, we've been able to read their history in a million articles and books, listen to albums or watch hundreds of hours of footage of their truest selves in concert film - and become self-proclaimed experts in our own right as fans.. much like deadheads who are obsessive in the same way about their band.  Still, this new movie gives a little more of a glimpse at the different mutations that grew in response to the experience as a whole. The times they were a part of, the events they witnessed, making both new creative avenues for an artist as they live through music as well as coping mechanisms, are on display here.  They kept moving, even when brick walls stood in their way and had to be hit on head first, all while defining the job description of rock stars, it's beautifully portrayed in this rocumentary and the result is a fresh perspective of a story we knew and now know some more of. A story that fascinates, shows new layers of the human beings behind the image each of the Rolling Stones wore, and brings you closer to the truths of what made them the greatest.",1500854400,,5881,4.687378640776699

5667239,5,B00BQTLVWK,"Fun and concise history of the stones. Lots of interviews mixed with some good concert footage. If you are a Stone's fan you should have it. I saw them get tear gassed in Lynn MA at the Manning Bowl during Satisfaction in 1966. Concert lasted maybe 20 minutes in the rain before the crowd rushed through the perimeter gating and the kids up front rushed the stage. Cops were trying to drag Keith off the stage and he was running around hitting them with his guitar. Saw them three years later at the Boston Garden during the  Get yer ya ya's out tour in '69 again in 72 and 75 then twice for Steel Wheels in Foxboro, Ma.  I could feel the heat from the gas torch explosions while sitting in the fifth row. and one more time where the Florida Panthers play NHL hockey. I AM A STONES FAN.

5667241,4,B00BQTLVWK,"Overall, a solid contribution to the Stones mythos.

The pros: unseen footage, including interviews, mostly with Mick, that add new insights to the raging moment the band was as much reacting as contributing to. Fascinating, for instance, how in the early years, the UK audiences - lots of teenage girls going nuts - ran starkly different from everywhere else on the continent - mostly dudes looking to break things -  but, hey, maybe that's old news to the Stones devotee. Contributing, sure,  but, much more arguably, creating. I never was much of a believer in that last one: Mick and Keith's genius was synthesizing and expressing, the blues, americana, reggae, disco, whatever, rather than creating new forms as the Beatles clearly did, although they sure did make each their own, in each and every case.

The cons: not enough burrowing into what made the band's golden years - Let it Bleed through Exile, with a few odd gems either scattered on Goats Head and It's Only... or resurfacing as face savers later, such as the ever peerless Waiting On A Friend. Someone still needs to tell, before the boys are ashes, whether the magic twas due to sniffing the fine scent of Alabama's magnolias at Muscle Shoals, taking in Mick Taylor's sweet guitar, or just snorting lots, lots, lots of dope. So, in no way the final word on this, er, seminal bunch.

One final note: not being, as perhaps implied above, a Stones devotee, yet otherwise sound of mind, I get the kvetch from those fans lamenting that the story here ends with Some Girls - their great, sweaty, lurid, completely convincing response to the wheel turning moment of Punk, if nowhere near defining as Exile or Sticky -  but, really, do we want a lengthy disquisition on the weak-tea'd glories of, say, Steel Wheels? Really? Not I. The point, I dare say, is that after Some Girls the band, while still great in some folks' eyes, was just no longer relevant. If you doubt it, just put on London Calling.

Then again, there were always two Stones fans: the ones who thought Honky Tonk Woman or Jumpin' Jack Flash or, going back, Satisfaction were the peak and those who pine still for another Moonlight Mile. For the latter, the song was sung by Soul Survivor; echoes were found in Angie and of course Waiting On.... The rest is wistfulness.",1495152000,,2300,4.720698254364089
5667242,4,B00BQTLVWK,"Pretty much like the excellent 25X5 compilation.  Pretty much downplaying Mick Taylors contributions and especially the original leader Brian Jones' unparalleled contributions to the bands success ( Mick Jagger is a close second).  Keith Richards has taken credit for Jones' achievements which is a joke.  Jagger Richards moniker has taken credit for Paint it Black ( a Jones song) Ruby Tuesday (a Jones song) Satisfaction (a jones/ Wyman song) Jumping Jack Flash (Wyman) and the early arrangements of classic R and B songs ( All Jones).  Mick Taylor got shafted is why he left the band, and after he left the quality of the music sunk like a rock and they probably used  old tapes to do their few remaining good song (Start Me Up is drudged up from old 71 song).
That said they all  made contributions and are all talented (Especially Jagger).  Tattoo You being their last great album, it is good that they ended it with Some Girls.",1494979200,,933,4.75776397515528

But I enjoyed every second of it and wanted more. The music... holy smokes, that music. It's expertly cut with still pictures and video, and it still sounds incredible. The sound editing is what makes this film so watchable and mesmerizing. You could ask why the Stones didn't get the full Beatles Anthology treatment, considering their career has been so much longer, and their influence arguably greater. Perhaps it's because the story is still being written. But honestly, would you really want to see a full hour or so on the making of ""Undercover""? Demo sessions for ""A Bigger Bang""? I thought not. Maybe there is an interesting doc waiting to be made about the Stones' awful 80s material, their decline in relevance, and their rise from the ashes every five years or so, but that film is not in here. Just like the band, I don't love this film for what I wish it would be, just for what it is, and that's more than good enough.",1439856000,,1075,4.575129533678757

5667281,2,B00BQTLVWK,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm a huge Stones fan. I've listened to almost all of their albums and while I find their post-Tattoo You output decidedly patchy, literally everything through Exile on Main St. is essential listening. Even a flawed effort like Their Satanic Majesties Request has moments of brilliance. I was eagerly anticipating watching this film, and while my low rating may be an example of having built up unreasonably high expectations, I don't think that was my problem.

The problem I had, above all else, is how dull this film is. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, and Ron Wood are all interviewed, but they are only heard and not seen; audio clips of them responding to questions are played over videos and still photographs and I found it very frustrating to watch an entire film about the Stones while hearing their words but never see them speak any of them. The film played like an NPR segment from a band with unquestionably different sensibilities, and this approach simply didn't work for me. Even more frustrating was how little depth and insight this film had to the Stones' history; watching it doesnt feel much different than reading their Wikipedia page, and the film is basically a powerpoint approach to their history, hitting all the key marks, but not doing much else.

I also took issue with the fact that several important and living former members of the Stones (Mick Taylor, Bill Wyman, etc.) were not interviewed, as I find their contributions to the band far greater and more vital than anything Ron Wood (their rhythm guitarist) has had to offer. He has the most out-of-control lifestyle of all the Stones, including Keith Richards (and not in a good way; he has a history of being abusive to women and getting away with it). I try as much as possible to separate the artist from the art, but Ive just never warmed to his playing; I have maintained, and I still maintain, that Keith Richards deserves a better counterpoint.

I really wanted to love this film, but I just couldnt.",1421539200,,2041,4.759887005649717

5667301,4,B00BQTLVWK,"As a lifelong Stones fan, having instantly switched allegiance from The Beatles with the release of ""Satisfaction,"" I was hoping that this project would be the unvarnished account of the Stones' fifty-year history that all the others haven't been.  While it is better than most (while maintaining that current annoying fascination with quick-cutting that doesn't allow your eye to rest on anything), it is still being seen through the sanitizing eyes of Mick Jagger, who was a producer on the film.  It's brilliant at covering the first seven or eight years of the band, but then underplays Brian Jones' death by misadventure, the huge contribution of Mick Taylor, Keith's addictions and the impact that had on the band, the feud between Mick and Keith in the early 1980s, and basically the entire history of the band for the last thirty years, which is a pretty deep trench.

Still, there is archival footage here that I've never seen, particularly from the first five years, and the delivery of the story is well-told and well-paced for what it is.  And yet, I still have this hope that a great director like Martin Scorsese will come along and do for the Stones what Scorsese did for George Harrison and Bob Dylan, and give us a real warts-and-all comprehensive study of this greatest rock and roll back of all time.  That probably means waiting until Mick doesn't exercise control over content, which mean I could be very old by then.",1392595200,,1438,4.829268292682927
5667302,4,B00BQTLVWK,"This had a lot of good stuff I never knew about. And had a lot about the original Stone, Brian Jones. He was a musical genius that was upstaged by Jagger/Richards writing abilities. Tragic ending for Jones. This documentary had a lot of scenes from other Stones movies. But it was very interesting.",1392422400,,298,4.6415094339622645
5667303,5,B00BQTLVWK,What more can you say???  Great documentary and I can enjoy it anytime I want. The Stones are still the definition of Rock n Roll through the decades.,1391299200,,150,4.357142857142857
5667304,3,B00BQTLVWK,I would have thought this documentary would go to the current day but it stops shortly after Ronnie joined the band which was the Black & Blue album in the mid seventies. I was expecting to see the Bigger Bang Tour. I also expected a lot more current in depth interviews from everyone in the band. It's heavily weighted to the early Stones and is probably the most comprehensive piece you could view from that era including a lot on Brian Jones. So if your primary focus is the early Stones you'll like this but if you're like me and expected a complete history you'll be disappointed.,1391212800,2,585,4.4766355140186915
5667305,4,B00BQTLVWK,"This is a rehash of the 25 X 5 VHS release, made on their 25th anniversary.  There is very little new material from what was previously available, and the Stones talk over the images throughout the film.  Somehow the director forgot to shut off their mikes during the musical performances.  The attention placed on the Brian Jones era is similar to how 25 X 5 was presented.  Let's face it, Bill Wyman was right when he wrote the Rolling Stones died with Brian Jones.  They might have become the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World, but they lost the unique sound they brought to the blues in their first lineup.  I may watch this a few times, but my first impression was I have seen this all before.  The bonus features, on the other hand, show some GREAT rare performances from 1964 and 1965.  The recordings are live, not dubbed, and run about 30 minutes.  The songs are complete and uninterrupted, and are alone worth the price of the DVD.",1390003200,,948,4.465116279069767

How a 1 hit wonder could compare to this band??
Anyway 1/2 way thru Honkey Tonk Woman, I looked @ my daughter & she was standing on her chair DANCING!  I tugged @ her & sais ""Not bad for a bunch of fossles?""

No one comes close to them, and these works provide an interesting insight into the lives of these great musicians,who have truly become great showmen.  Judge for yourself, but I think you'll agree that the works I have menttioned tell a great story about the Rolling Stones.

5667316,4,B00BQTLVWK,"I have enjoyed the art of the Rolling Stones for four decades. So, on the one hand, I enjoy this. On the other hand, it is a bit disappointing in its scope.

My notes show a wide range of events that struck me on this DVD: Dick Cavett's presence on the DVD, the concert footage (""Street Fighting Man,"" for instance), life on tours, audiences and their reaction to the Stones, Andrew Loog Oldham, media interviews (e.g., someone asking Charlie Watts about why the Stones were successful and his succinct answer--""The music!""), Brian Jones and his role with the Stones and with his demise, the Hyde Park concert and Jones, Mick Taylor and Ron Woods taking over Jones' role, Altamount and its horror, Kaith Richards' legal troubles in Canada. . .

My only wish? The story ends too early. We do not really get a view of the Stones later on. Bill Wyman's departure, Keith's and Mick's on and off relationship, the ambitious world tours, the challenges (Charlie's health problems), and so on.

So, the bottom line? I really enjoyed this. But it felt incomplete. . . .",1382227200,,1061,4.663101604278075

Second, the first half hour or so is just performance clips, cut together with offstage clips and some band commentary, but does little to deepen anyone's knowledge of the Stones.

As another reviewer pointed out, the 25x5 documentary is far more comprehensive than Crossfire Hurricane. Crossfire Hurricane concentrates mainly on the years 1967 to 1977, with a particular emphasis on the 1972 period. Restored, cleaned-up footage of C#%!sucker Blues and some 1973 film marks the high point in terms of rare film utilized. As a primer for casual Stones fans, Crossfire Hurricane isn't very useful, but even as something avid fans would be interested in the documentary falls a bit short (to have such a documentary and not even mention Marianne Faithfull or Anita Pallenberg once?). It's okay, but too short to be definitive and a good chunk of the film included has been compiled from 25x5, Gimme Shelter, Ladies and Gentleman:The Rolling Stones and C#%!sucker Blues. There are a few 1964 and 1965 live clips in the extras that were fun to see. Interesting but not quite essential.",1372377600,4,1054,4.926966292134831

""Hurricane"" is ridiculous - NO mention of Ian Stewart, Anita Pallenberg, Marianne Faithful, Allen Klien, or even that embarrassing little hissy fit Mick & Keef pitched in in the mid-eighties, that most horrid decade for popular music: the decade when Rock and Roll died.  Indeed, after ""Hurricane"" spends an inordinate time babbling about the ""see how the mighty hath fallen""-POS, ""Miss You,"" someone mentions ""aging"" - and BLAM, ""cut to credits.""  It's sad...the Stones are having to trot around Mick Taylor with them on this, hopefully, THE ""last time"" to try to show that, under the ""direction"" of Leavell, they ain't but a ""tribute act"" anymore - and it ain't working.  ""Crossfire Hurricane"" is but further proof of this sad, sad fact.  Save your money, folks.  Maybe Jane Rose, the only person in the Stones' ""backline organization"" with any integrity anymore will get Lorne Michaels, the director of ""25 x 5"" to do something after this tour is over. 8/12/13 - I spoke with an old musician buddy over the weekend about this tripe, and all he could do was laugh, ""I paid $5 less than you did for it!""

With Crossfire, it is a 50/50 as for material, yes there are several unreleased scenes in the movie, BUT, for every one unreleased bit, there is a section of equal length material that you have already seen if you have bought such films as ""Charlie is my Darling,"" ""Ladies and Gentlemen..."", ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" or ""Give Me Shelter""...ect. So as a previous reviewer has pointed out when they show 'Jumping Jack Flash' it dose have about half the promo with alternate rough cut angels but then the rest is what you've seen on the bonus DVD to the singles volume 3 box set, so some alternate angels but then again half is what you already can see on a site like youtube. When they talk about Brain's death, do they use footage from that time, NO, they jump several years to the Stones looking sad or depressed in the studio while listening to tracks from Exiles, which is footage you can find on the ""Exiles"" DVD that the band released several years ago in conjunction with the re-release of that excellent album. That being said when they talk about Andrew, there early manager, you get some 20 second bits, no complete segments of film, intermixed with allot of footage from this years release of the awesome ""Charlie Is My Darling."" over all when i first watched this is was 100% disappointed, felt like a quick flash in the pants, and i still feel the stones could have given us more or the director could have used allot more unused footage that we had not seen yet, still waiting for the Stones to release the Hyde Park Concert, which was film, in full (you get about 5 minutes, that's it). To me now watching it again, the new commentary that they did over footage is not bad and sometime is it vary insightful, but with all they have written already about themselves, you could find what they think without watching the film, though it is nice to hear them say it. i simply wonder the unreleased stuff or bits, will it be available in a few years in full, is this a teaser for more unreleased material ? my friend for years has had the Hampton coliseum show on Bootleg dvd in full for years, we get about 5 minutes cut up at the end of the dvd, while not looking that much better, will this be released in full, if so, I have a feeling this release like so many greatest hits albums will not be essential unless you like the the one or two new songs they through on, with allot that you already own. Love the stones, but i would rent this not buy it. Also as one person also said aside from it needing to be more thorough like the Beatles anthology was, it stops about a few years into wood career making the last 30 years almost seem unimportant, sad.",1370563200,,2839,4.419847328244275
5667363,3,B00BQTLVWK,"Compared to other historical presentations I have purchased, I was a little disappointed in this offering.

5667364,5,B00BQTLVWK,As a admirer of the Stones I looked forward to seeing this film. Lots of cuts and video that have not been seen before. Really shows off their talent through the ages. It mostly stops at the mid 80s but then the film is long enough. I would love to hear more of the audio interviews with the members.,1370476800,,300,4.101694915254237
5667365,4,B00BQTLVWK,"This is a pretty good look at the early years through the ""Still Life"" tour.  I loved seeing some of the old film I'd not seen before.

Yes, this is whitewashed vs. what we BELIEVE actually happened - though, WE weren't in the circle.

Bianca wasn't mentioned.  Anita wasn't mentioned.  Though I've only seen this DVD once, I don't remember Ian Stewart being mentioned nor Allen Klein.

My disappointment was in the last part of the movie, it seems so incomplete.

The good by far outweighs the bad and fans will enjoy seeing this DVD but it does seem incomplete, thus the 4 out of 5 rating here.

25 x 5 and Crossfire Hurricane are probably all we'll get - and those two ain't bad.",1370390400,,682,4.4
5667366,5,B00BQTLVWK,"Okay, I'll admit up front that I really like the Rolling Stones but they aren't my favorite band and I don't consider myself a ""Stonehead"" (if that's a real term. But I do love music documentaries, expecially when they are well done, and I enjoyed watching this film on Bluray. There are about 20 others reviews here before this posting and some are by diehard Stones fans so, if you are one of those, you might be best guided by them. But one reviewer tried to compare this 2 hour+ film with the nine-hour one on the Beatles, which is unfair. We know that the Stones authorized this so it's factual and with lots of bonus features - 9 performances and an interview with the director it's truly a bargain at the list price that Eagle Rock placed on it.  This certainly updates earlier Stones documentaries like ""25x5"" from 1990.

There will be real consensus on if this is the best Stones DVD but, as a casual listener for nearly 50 years, I found it entertaining and insightful.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5667368,5,B00BQTLVWK,"I don't have words to rate this documentary. It's simply the best rockumentary that I have ever seen.
The Rolling Stones contributed with their music in the change of modern society. Every person in the Western Civilization is a ""December's Children"". The music of The Rolling Stones is the soundtrack of the last 50 years, the sound track of a hedonistic society that can't get Satisfaction.
The Rolling Stones are indeed The Best Rock'n Roll band in the World, and still the Greatest Show on Earth",1370044800,,499,4.813953488372093

5667371,2,B00BQTLVWK,"Considering that the RS have been around for 1/2 century, it was really inexcusable that this documentary should leave out their output from the 80s. 90s. and 2000s. A major disappointment and really not even close to covering their output of music and film during the later period of their career. I came away with the impression that the band just doesn't give a crap about their legacy when they put out such a half assed effort as this. The creative process and story behind the idea for the songs would have been a welcome approach. I am tired of hearing about the sex, drug use, and decadence that has been rehashed for the past four decades. A lot of footage showed the squalid and filthy conditions some members of the group (Richards in particular) choose to live in during the Exile Main Street period. It really is about time to move on with a new and fresh perspective.",1369699200,4,881,4.547169811320755
5667372,4,B00BQTLVWK,"I saw this when it aired on HBO, and I liked the program. I accidentally ordered the Blu-Ray version, so I had to return it for the DVD version instead. I do wish they had gone on further in the program; it stops int he mid-1980's, which leaves the viewer kind of hanging if he/she does not know the history of The Rolling Stones.",1369612800,,330,4.171875
5667373,2,B00BQTLVWK,"This is a good program, as far as it goes. But - one short DVD for the STONES??!!?? They require something more comprehensive, like the Beatles Anthology. Here's just a sample of what should have been explored: 1. their background in the British Blues scene. A stones history with no mention of Alexis Korner??!! 2. Background on Mick Taylor. No discussion of his playing with the Gods and John Mayall. 3. Again, background on Ron Wood and the Faces. 4. A huge problem is that the film ends with the beginning of the eighties. There is a whole other history which was not explored. By the way, contributions by Bobby Keys and other sidemen were ignored.

My basic complaint is the film was heavy on showbiz and scandal at the expense of the discussion of the music. For example, Keith's use of open G tuning gained from Ry Cooder. Their meeting with blues heroes would also have been a nice touch (they DID record at Chess in the '60s). Also, a film about the Stones with NO mention of Chuck Berry? Come on!! (pun intended)!! I am coming at this film from the perspective of a musician. People who want a thorough review of the stones as ""players"" will just have to wait for another film. For those of you who want to see pictures of Mick's bare behind or Keith stoned out of his gourd, though, I guess this is the place to be. I'm sorry, but that's the way I see it.",1369440000,59,1367,4.381889763779528
5667374,3,B00BQTLVWK,"The definitive story about the Rolling Stones ends on the ""Some Girls"" songs showing how the guys made it to mainstream popularity.  I find that strange since the band played another thirty plus years.  As a documentary too much time is spent on out of control audiences and the Stones being bad boys with the law and drugs.  What about the music?  The positives are excellent, vintage clips throughout and the band members interviews.  Keith Richards as usual is funny, slurred voice and all.  Some other good stuff is in detail: Brian Jones death/Hyde Park concert; Altamont; And why all the personnel changes. (Brian Jones, Mick Taylor, Ronnie Wood).  Ian Stewart isn't mentioned which is a major blunder if were talking Rolling Stones.  The bonus section is really good, showing lots of complete songs from the mid-1960s.  As a story it is no ""25 X 5 The Continuing Adventures Of The Rolling Stones"" in any shape or form.  (That film covers the very beginning by far better; the fallout of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards; Rock Hall of Fame induction; their wives; Blues influences of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf in film; Clips with the Beatles, other groups and much more thru 1989).  So in summary ""Crossfire Hurricane"" has its moments, but I wouldn't tag this DVD as the definitive story.  Maybe ""Prime Years"" or ""1963 to 1978"".  I guess another DVD will be in the making for the 2nd half.  If any fans out there  own ""25 X 5"", my advice is hold on to it.  ""Crossfire Hurricane"" is good, not great.",1369353600,16,1506,4.669201520912548
5667375,3,B00BQTLVWK,"Following more the route of Dylan's ""No Direction Home"" than the Beatles' multi-set ""Anthology"", this documentary is a somewhat convincing overview from the years when their personal history was nearly as essential as their music. It ends with their stage set from their 1981 North American Tour when the Stones were commercially at their apex.

You get some rare black and white plus color footage interspersed with recent audio-only interviews from the surviving bandmates. Of special note, Brian Jones himself is given more interview space and scenes than ever before.

The part that works about this DVD is that it permits you to see the relationship amongst the band members growing and therefore changing with time. A priceless moment occurs in a motel room with Mick singing and Keith on acoustic guitar literally working out their first collaboration, ""Tell Me"". Manager Andrew Loog Oldham keeps the beat on a nightstand. You also notice the relationship between the band and the public evolving and changing over the years. Their early live performances draw out the pandemonium that broke out with their audience no matter where they traveled.

The most poignant moment is some wonderful colorful footage with the band circled on the floor of Olympic studios. It's this scene where Brian plays exquisite slide guitar on an alternate version of ""No Expectations"". Jagger praises his playing on the track but he also makes clear that this was Brian's last major contribution to the band and he appeared to lack interest in their musical direction. Yet there's an enormous hole in this part of the story, ultimately being given the gloss-over during this crucial period. What about the Jagger-Richards axis, Anita and Marianne and Brian's two drug busts?

If you don't know much about the Stones' history, this documentary attempts to make an interesting storyline because the series of events, starting as early as 1964,  would lead to tragedy in 1969. It's unequivocally their most dramatic and traumatic year for two very different reasons. In their recollections last year, Jagger especially sounds contrite when he discusses Brian's disintegration and death. He's gathered wisdom and he wishes that they had taken better care of Brian. Richards exhibits his sentimentality in his own way. Keith claims the Hyde Park Concert was Brian's funeral rather than him attending the actual service. By the way, part of the service appears here. The other event that year, of course, was Altamont. Historically, both Mick and particularly Keith had been pretty taciturn concerning this concert. But here they open up to it a bit more. Their accounts are still brief but revealing nonetheless.

The seventies and beyond find their history (not their music) as kind of an anti-climax, but Keith's lifestyle still sustains some attention. Unfortunately again, not enough is offered here. And once Keith concludes that the band is priority over smack, their story becomes even more peripheral. It rests on the pride of continuity which, after 50 years, is pretty cool and I'm truly grateful Keith is around to tell the ""fairy story"". But let it be known that they still have the ""Anthology"" in them. Get to it guys while someone still cares!

The bonus features of 1964-65 live performances, which have complete songs, are a must see and hear. In actuality, this is probably the highlight because it's all about the music.",1369353600,4,3420,5.118279569892473
5667376,2,B00BQTLVWK,"Like always the 60's were overplayed, they did a little better job covering up the 70's up to Black and Blue. But then it just dropped no Some Girls era, No Emotional Rescue (a very under rated collection of songs) nothing from then on up;.  Its too bad 25x5 is no longer in print, they did gracefully touched on the 80's. They refuse to acknowledge there was life after Keith's drug bust in Canada. There was so much more, Jagger 'quiting' in the mid to late 80's. They weren't the best Collection of songs but STeel Wheels, Voodoo Lounge, Bridges to Babylon, none of the era was covered. So you got a CD advertising 50 years, and the best you get is maybe 15 years. Totally dissatisfied for a Stones fan from the beginning. There has got to be a Part 2 in the makings, I felt ripped. Most of the CD was already covered in other Docs.

This documentary should be nominated for awards with the way Bret Morgan has brilliantly put this masterpiece together.  He chronicles the Stones from the beginning with great footage with Brian all the way until when Woody joins the group.  He does a wonderful job covering the problems with Brian, Altamont, the Stones' exile to France and so much more.  The music is so perfect that was chosen for each part of this documentary.  Lots of focus on the Exile to Main Street days with Mick Taylor, when I think the band was at it's best!
Amazon is offering this excellent DVD for only $9.99!!!  Trust me if you are a Stones fan or know someone who is, this is a must have for their collection!!!",1368489600,8,871,4.474683544303797

I saw at HBO, is an excellent documentary, the moment that Brian Jones play the introduction of ""No expectations"" his last contribution to the group make me feel very sad. It was his last creative peak, really a pity.",1367452800,2,219,4.5
5667380,4,B00BQTLVWK,"'Crossfire Hurricane' is a tantalizing but peculiar and incomplete look at the Rolling Stones.  It's audio interview of the Stones' remembrances of their early days placed over some fairly compelling, illustrative footage.  Most notably, we're told that ""no cameras were allowed"" (when recording the interviews).  One can't help think that seeing the rockers up close - Jagger's now famous wrinkles, Richards' ravaged features - would have stolen more than a few measures of energy from the tales of their sixties and early seventies heyday.  Jagger is as sharp a business mind as they come and Keith - to the shock of all - remembers everything (as his brilliant biography attests to).  So, those restrictions come across as a calculated decision to me. Can't say I blame them, but it gives a production a distant, paint-by-numbers feel at times.

The production pores over their early 60s meet-up through Ronnie Wood's 1975 entry into the band.  That means we get a deep dive through that period, through first brushes with stardom and fan hysteria, Brian Jones' dismissal/departure (a particular high point of the film), Mick Taylor's entry and subsequent taking of leave (love Keith calling Taylor a 'virtuoso') and then Wood's arrival.  The film doesn't track too closely to albums (think about how obsessively similar Beatles productions do), so I'll best describe things by saying that it there's a fairly constant 'touch' of music up through about Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street...with 'Exile' getting more attention than anything else due to the debauchery of the recording sessions in France.

Then, suddenly, it's the 'Some Girls' tour and - even more suddenly - there's a coda of the now-aged band belting out 'All Down the Line.'  All well and good for the focus on the best parts, but doesn't this editing play right into the hands of those who say (and there's quite a few that make this claim) that the band's done nothing relevant since 'Some Girls'?

Still, this movie is catnip for any Stones fan.  My favorite part of the film: footage of the young Jagger and Richards offstage at work. Encouraged by their label to write their own songs (no doubt by the success of Lennon and McCartney, whose brilliance as songwriters set the music world on its ear) they sit together grinding out an early effort, the sweat of creativity at work.  It's nothing memorable, but those humble beginnings sowed the seeds of Satisfaction, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Street Fighting Man, Sympathy for the Devil, It's Only Rock 'n Roll and hundreds of other pieces of creative genius that have become pillars of rock and roll songwriting.",1366588800,37,2638,4.981776765375854
5667381,4,B00BQTLVWK,"I watched this on HBO and I intend to purchase it because of the great bonus content listed in the description. Video of the early Stones has been very rare to find, so the recent release of Charlie Is My Darling along with the bonus performances on Crossfire Hurrican are greatly appreciated.

I am a longtime Rolling Stones collector, so I know that some of the video shown in Crossfire Hurricane is rare and some not seen even by collectors. On the other hand, the story itself holds no surprises. You can read any book about the Rolling Stones that has been published in the last 50 years and you will learn as much about the history of the Rolling Stones as you will learn in this documentary. If you want indepth history, buy Bill Wyman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rolling-with-the-Stones/dp/B000IOF0QM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rolling with the Stones</a>. I am disappointed that this documentary doesn't dig deeper. This is what the Rolling Stones want you to know, which is nothing you don't already know. I thought that the storyline was boring to the point that I just tuned it out and focused on the visuals.

None of the Stones of today appear in the movie, but their voices are used to narrate the story. This works because (no joke intended here) they are old and the videos show them as young men. The justaposition would have been too much, even for the Stones themselves. Done this way, we can still imagine them as young rock gods, striding the earth, pillaging villages and running off with the women. Not old men who can barely get up the energy to perform on stage (re: recent comments by Charlie Watts).

Because of the rarity and quality of some of the video, the superb production values, and the bonus performances, Crossfire Hurricane is a must own for Stones fans.

ADDENDUM ON BONUS MATERIAL: Now that I own the DVD I can comment on the bonus material. It is definitely worth buying this DVD just for the bonus live performance from 64/65. I love watching Mick perform from this era because he's just beginning to test the waters, and he's not vamping and camping like he did in later years, culminating in his over-the-top performances of the 75/76 tours. And it's great to see Brian perform live, too, and see that he was an equally great harp player as well as guitar player.",1366070400,6,2357,4.855721393034826
5667382,3,B00BQTLVWK,"I could not WAIT for this to show on HBO! While it was somewhat interesting, I came away from it not knowing too much more about these guys than I did going in. There are some great clips here and there - always good, but when the show was over, I was left wanting more: more detail and more of who these people are.

I will use the example of the other big relatively recent musician documentary, the one Martin Scorcese did about George Harrison. A HUGE Harrison fan, I went in knowing a great deal and left having an even more well-rounded, fuller picture of who George was and how he created. As enjoyable as the clips and music in Crossfire Hurricane, this doc did little to do the same for the Rolling Stones.  Nice box shot of Mick though.

The part surrounding Brian Jones' death was appreciated and illuminating, but it still felt incomplete.

These guys are bigger than life to a whole lot of us, but this film felt more like a bad Bob Dylan bio - and nothing was revealed.

Some reviewers have complained about the usage of audio-only narration and the wall that such a device puts between speaker and viewer/listener.  I disagree.  The Stones built that wall themselves with the audio remarks they chose to include in the film.  Watch ""The Filth and The Fury"" about the Sex Pistols,"" one of the BEST music docs of all time.  They too chose not to be photographed with their narration.  It made perfect sense because the band only lasted a short time and the subject of the doc was THAT time, unlike the Stones who are still out there doing it.  The Pistols seemed much more authentic and unedited in expressing themselves and it gave me a more complete picture of them individually and them together as a band.  It also gave me a new appreciation for them.  Lydon's frustration and grief over Sid's demise is truly palpable.  The Stones offered nothing even close in Crossfire, even when talking about Brian's death.  It all felt very rehearsed and very detached. You don't want to show yourself? Fine, then don't make a documentary about yourself!

If you want to get a better insight into The Stones, go back and watch the Maysles' Gimme Shelter.

The good news is that this film sent me back to the vinyl to listen to some Stones music I had not listened to in a long time; you know, the stuff dripping in emotion and power. I went back to December's Children... and Flowers and Between the Buttons and the Rolling Stones Now and Out of Our Heads and 12x5 and Beggars Banquet and of course, Aftermath. I have bought a lot of Stones cd compilations, but hadn't listened to lots of those albums beginning to end in years. The movie made me want to go back and re-discover all of that great music - which is, after all, why we still care after 50 years!",1366070400,28,2765,4.454365079365079
5667383,5,B00BQTLVWK,"I have now watched this four times on HBO and I intend to buy this on either DVD or BluRay or both. There are interviews and footage I have never seen and I have just about everything collectible where the Rolling Stones are concerned. For me, the highlight of this documentary is the alternate alternate version of Jumpin Jack Flash, which I have never seen anywhere and it beats everything else and I wish I could get clear, clean copies of every video of this classic Stones ""comeback"" single with Brian Jones. (Of course, the Holy Grail of The Stones performing JJF would be The NME Pollwinners concert of The Stones surprise appearance in 1968.) Surprisingly, the period with Brian Jones is handled objectively and, especially with comments by Mick, Keith and Charlie, with much sensitivity. Of course, there is the ""Exile in France"" period resulting in Exile on Main Street and the 1972 tour and frank talk about Keith's drug problems and so much more. Bill Wyman sounds like a wizened, old man in this doc and he has some excellent remembrances. As does Charlie and Mick Taylor. Well, anyway, I'll probably hit HBO On Demand and watch this again. And again. I'm a fan, of course, but this is one excellent documentary for the 50th Anniversary of The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.",1364947200,76,1298,4.697368421052632
