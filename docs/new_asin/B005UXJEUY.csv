4894763,5,B005UXJEUY,"I really enjoyed Quantum Leap as a child, but always disliked the fact that I could never catch all of the episodes in their correct order, but this complete series finally made that wish come true. Now I have the option to leisurely sit back and watch as many episodes as I want without worrying about commercials and other interruptions. Seasons 2-5 are double sided discs so I only had to deal with 3 discs for every season instead of 6 or more.",1300752000,5,448,4.409638554216867

4894766,4,B005UXJEUY,"4 stars for two reasons. 1. Because there are no subtitles for those of us that are hard of hearing. 2. In first few seasons, the leaps at the end tend to be repeat leaps. For example, he leaps into Jesse something like a half dozen times.

There are other minor things. They should have digitized the show. It is grainy, but only when you get far too close.

It is still worth the money even to those that are not huge fans. The cast is great, and range of acting and emotion are covered by best cast ever.",1523836800,,507,4.111111111111111

4894780,4,B005UXJEUY,"I don't want to negatively impact the review with my modern perception. I'd forgotten how boring this show is. And what a creep Al is (they toned it down as the seasons went on I think). What is pretty hilarious in my modern estimation is, is that everything important ever done by anyone of any gender, race, color, or creed, was actually really done by this white guy here. They probably wouldn't make this show nowadays, even if we have a better idea of quantum mechanics and string theory.
It's also weird how it started with a religious bent, and lost that as seasons progressed. I see no problem with conflating religion and science, and since it started that way, it's just funny to me that they changed it.
Some day I'll go searching for treatises on this show's paradoxes. Didn't he come from the future and give his younger self the idea for time travel in the past? (Won't even talk about how Stevie King supposedly remembered something from Sam's dream sequence.)
The show is great for writers, it writes itself. Open old newspaper, read front page headlines, send time traveler back there to do what the person in the newspaper did. Also those brilliant writers, they must have had the hardest time thinking of ways for him to get his shirt off every single episode. Congrats, Bakula, you're the only person from the 80s who knew about sit-ups. It still doesn't make you a good starship captain, so keep your shirt on.",1518048000,,1431,4.637795275590551

4894785,5,B005UXJEUY,I like having the whole series in one box.  We love the series.  The only thing we don't like is the packaging.,1517443200,,111,4.0
4894786,4,B005UXJEUY,My husband was excited to receive this for Christmas! He loved that it was the entire series. I was disappointed with the packaging. The discs are inside a cardboard sleeve that is flimsy and was already falling apart upon arrival.,1517270400,,231,4.8

4894790,3,B005UXJEUY,"The packaging is an embarrassment. It arrived crushed in shipment, and it would have been amazing had it not, as it is deplorably flimsy and ineffective. The discs are packaged individually in cheap paper sleeves. A highly disappointing first impression. That noted, the programs play well, and as the series is truly marvelous, the set is worth having. Just do not anticipate giving this as a gift, as it provides the impression of being bought at a flea market. I'm surprised that Amazon would place their logo upon an envelope that contains a presentation so poor as this. Not something that will sit on a shelf - you will want to stick it in a drawer. The most substandard packaging I have ever received through Amazon, and something assuredly not up to par with the exceptional program it contains.",1515542400,,803,4.784172661870503

Storage box has about 2X the amount of room needed for the discs, so expect your box to arrive a bit bent out of shape. I just tapes the box together with clear packing tape and it's now working fine.",1515110400,,298,4.228070175438597
4894793,5,B005UXJEUY,Such an underrated show. Love having the entire series,1515024000,,54,5.111111111111111
4894794,5,B005UXJEUY,"I bought ""Quantum Leap: The Complete Series"" for my parents this past summer. They are retired. And they love watching a lot of classic movies and shows. They just finished watching the entire ""Quantum Leap"". They loved it so much!

""Quantum Leap"" first aired on my 18th birthday. It was my favorite TV show from that day forward through all my college years. It would be interesting if we could leap back in time, like Dr. Sam Beckett, and ""really"" change things. All my college girl friends, at that time, really loved him. We loved Al, too. He made us laugh. All the actors worked so wonderful together. And the show was so enjoyable. It really was an adventure!

I loved the way each episode ended, because you couldn't wait to see the next one. To me, the show could go on forever. It was that good. Everything was perfect, even to the end. Even though, you wanted to see more!

I really felt that I leaped into the scenes. Many, if not all, Donald P. Bellisario creations are absolutely incredible. ""Magnum, P.I."" was one of my favorite shows in high school. I loved watching ""NCIS"" during my battle with cancer.

If you haven't watched ""Quantum Leap"" yet, I encourage you to buy the box set. Take the ""Quantum Leap""! I hope that you enjoy it as much as my family and me.",1514937600,,1277,4.467811158798283
4894795,1,B005UXJEUY,"NOT the complete series. What is shown as the ""pilot"" is actually several episodes into the series. Endings and episodes are also out of order. Might be better to get individual seasons.",1514764800,,186,4.84375
4894796,4,B005UXJEUY,There has been alot of great tv shows in past and now . Before Belisarius made popular tv show Ncis they did Quantam Leap a great scifi tv show now cult favorite . The show is about Dr. Sam backett(Scott Bakula ) a physicist  and his friend Al Calavicci ( Dean Stockwell) a former naval officer they founded and funded and made prodject Quatuam Leap  a time travling experiment thru space and time . So as Dr Sam backett step into chamber he took first leap and vanish leaping in his own timeline into peoples lives fixing their lives that ended tragic and making them for the better and each time he fix them closer to the leap home and he's not alone he got Al to guide him in his quest to give him support and guidens but he's only a hologram that sam can only see and hear . This show last for five years 1989 to 93  every episode was good the story the humor the drama and acting and charchter were all great  we all were leapers with sam and al now we can leap forever remember this awesome show and adventures we watched for five years or thoes new to discover  what loyal fans know .  This is great show based on history and answer the question of what if  So buy dvd or bluray get ready to leap into the adventures of a lifetime with sam and al . The blu ray is great pic is hd perfect and sound is great all orginal music is here no bonus features .  There are surprises and guest stars in this show as well. Only one downfall when sam leaps into some episodes it out of place other than that it's good .,1514592000,,1514,4.074074074074074

4894800,3,B005UXJEUY,"The video quality is excellent and all the original music is restored... but... Mill Creek Entertainment made one fatal flaw when producing this QUANTUM LEAP: THE COMPLETE SERIES boxed set. These videos, released in 2017, have NO CLOSED CAPTIONING on any of them -- which is a ADA violation, FCC violation, and CVAA violation (against the law) in the USA, and makes it IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy one of my favorite tv shows with friends of mine who also love this show, because they are Deaf. That's the reason I reduced what would've been a 5-star rating down to just 3-stars. Failure to include closed captioning! (Even more bizarre, the original tv show did, in fact, air with closed captioning!) There's a saying: ""Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance."" -- well, this boxed set looks inviting but then it forces you to sit in a corner alone if you're Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing. NOT COOL.",1512950400,2,920,4.75625

So far I viewed season three and am getting near the end of season 4 without any problems. This DVD set has more information on each episode and some extras not found on the seasons 1 & 2 set marketed by Mill Creek.

Other than that , No problems.",1510790400,,360,3.75
4894806,2,B005UXJEUY,"Let's put the series aside - it is fantastic, seminal scifi.

This product, however, is aweful. The box quality is flimsy, the DVD sleeves are unprotective and equally as subpar. My first attempt arrived - well, it looked like it had been stepped on (mailed in a hardly protective, for such an insubstantial product, bubble envelope). This was returned. My second attempt arrived, again in a very unprotective bubble envelope, a little crinkled but certainly much better than the first.

I should have spent the extra $10/$15 for the Blu-Ray set.

At least the disks seem to play alright.",1509926400,,588,4.91919191919192
4894807,4,B005UXJEUY,"I got this and was concerned of quality for the DVDs. Basically, all the boxes I saw on the shelf were dented and bent.  I flipped over the box and saw it had 18 DVDs in it.  So after opening it, I see why it's like that.  The box was made 2x too big and all the DVDs are in a cardboard sleeve that's generic with a disc on each side.  No liner notes, no liner pictures.... nothing..... at first I was annoyed at this.... but then I realized that I paid $30 for 18 DVDs of a show I really enjoyed.  That comes out to less than $2 per disc.  I bet if these were in thin jewel cases that it would fill the box, but for the price I paid, I'm not complaining.  Just don't let the quality of the packaging dissuade you from this.

Because there are so many discs, I'm ripping them to my PC and putting them on my iPod (which encodes at about 550MB per episode which is a decent rate for live video and produces great quality).  As I don't think I could navigate through this packaging if I weren't doing this.

But it's a GREAT deal for $30.  Next is Knight Rider and then I guess I'll move onto Sliders.",1509840000,,1099,3.9954128440366974
4894808,4,B005UXJEUY,"Received as a gift - as others have noted, the bonus features of the original QL discs are missing.

The review isn't about the show itself. Apparently several episodes are missing from seasons. I believe she said episodes are missing from season 1 and season 5 (the final season I believe). It's pretty obvious since every episode ends with the main character in his new body and the next episode starts with that person he has become. Not sure why the episodes are missing: if it was just a bad job of creating of the set or if there were legal reasons the episodes couldn't be included.

Quality of the video is high and does seem to be remastered and not upconverted. Unfortunately, the video is 4:3 and not 16:9.

Quality of the audio if good with DTS-HD MA 2.0 48 kHz audio. Unfortunately, the PS4 does not show the audio bitrate.

It's one thing for it to be 4:3, though I'm unconvinced they couldn't do better as most shows were filmed in 16mm, so they weren't natively filmed in 4:3. A 16:9 transfer IS possible, just look at The X-Files as an example or numerous other older TV shows that all aired in 4:3. The bare-bones menus are nothing impressive, either.

4894881,3,B005UXJEUY,"This review is for the Blu-ray edition (ASIN: B01MY5JRSX)

Why I wanted this set? I already own the original DVD sets Universal put out a few years back but as every Quantum Leap fan knows, most of the original soundtrack in the first editions of the Quantum Leap on DVD series was replaced by something else, mostly Muzak. There are two episodes where that was unforgivable, the last episode of Season 2 were Beth (Als wife) is dancing by herself to the tune of Georgia on my mind while Al as a hologram dances with her and the last episode of Season 5 (Series finale where Sam goes back to the same moment in time and fixes Al's life when he tells his wife that he is alive and that she should wait for him, again both of those were set to Ray Charles' ""Georgia on my mind"" and somehow without it, it didn't have the same emotional impact, well now they have been finally restored.

Most times that studios do those change-overs I don't notice them but this time it was embedded in my mind since the first time I watched the series on TV and my only refuge were old VHS tapes I had from the original broadcast show, now finally they can go away for time served.

I cannot appreciate much improvement in the video and to be honest is only slightly better, from scenes that look excelent or really good to others where they show video artifacts. It looks like there was no restoration (I might be mistaken of course) and they simply upscaled the old transfers they had for the DVD series, but at least they try to make it up with the audio and the restoration of the original music.

I hope that someone will put out a better transfer from the original positives, maybe in a 4K definitive restoration sometime in the future or just a proper 1080p restoration like Japan had done in the past with Thunderbirds are go, by the way I am watching these in my 4K Vizio UHDTV playing on my Oppo BDP-105D.

It doesnt matter how many other times Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell have been in other shows or movies; they will go down in TV history as one of the greatest actors for this TV show.

P.S. I just found out something that is going to be important for a lot of people... There are no subtitles, the old DVD had them in English, Spanish, French and they were Closed Caption too, this is a big disservice to a great segment of population, because of this I am taking 1 star. Another problem is that the sets that have 4 blu-rays (seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5) instead of proper 4 BR cases they have 2BR cases with two together, one on top of the other, so in the long run they are going to be scratched.

Another thing that is really strange is that being this a Region A set, it does not include a French soundtrack for our Canadian neighbors and gone are the intros by Scott Bakula on some episodes. I would have gladly pay a little more for a better quality transfer and presentation.",1489017600,7,2879,4.300738007380073

I thought it was interesting how they packaged the Blu Ray discs...to begin with, they stack two on each side, one on top of the other, don't like that.  Si I was going though the discs to make sure all were there...seasons 1-4, four discs per case...got to season 5 and only two discs in there, discs 3 and 4!  Was about to write amazon for a replacement when I looked in the other cases.  Case one (labeled Season One) Had Season one, discs 1 and 2 and Season two Discs 1 and 2.  Odd...go to next case, labeled Season 2...Yup, Discs 3 and 4 of season two and discs 1 and 2 from season 3!  And so on to case #5 where there was only discs 3 and 4 for Season 5.  So I had to go through all the cases and put the proper discs in the right case....season 1 only had two discs because it wasn't a full season.

4894893,4,B005UXJEUY,"A classic Science Fiction series that has held up amazingly well, ""Quantum Leap"" rocketed Scott Bakula to stardom. The show was never a super hit but performed steadily on NBC in the 80's. Luckily, unlike some shows, ""QL"" was shot and edited on film (unlike ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" which was edited on videotape).

The good news is that the show looks better than it did in its DVD incarnation as detail and depth are improved. Color tends to look washed out and a bit dull at times and it's clear that color timing for this transfer wasn't a priority. It's clear that these masters got very little love during the transfer process but they did choose superior sources for almost everything here except ""Trioan"" which, like the Netflix version, has the last 7-8 minutes zoomed in for some reason. I'm not exactly clear why this flaw couldn't have been fixed unless, perhaps, the reframing was pulled from a different source due to damage I suspect it was just careless framing on the part of the person who did the transfer itself for this one segment but the former could also be true. It could be that, at some point, they were going to make these available in a widescreen aspect ratio and used a port in of that master, putting it in 1.33:1. It didn't impact the older DVDs but those were lower resolution masters. Dirt and debris is pretty minimal so someone did do a a little bit of clean up.

The audio sounds pretty good with dialog clear and dynamic which is a good thing because we don't get any subtitles (not unusual for a Mill Creek release but virtually unheard of in this day and age) in any language or any other audio tracks for the show. I suspect that the budget that might have been used here for subtitles was used, instead, for the guarantee that Universal would present the music in tact and resolve licensing issues that dogged the original DVDs in most countries.

There aren't any special features--it is odd because when this was licensed for release in Australia, the original DVD special features were included there. It isn't much but it was nice to have.

The packaging is odd. We get the first two discs of season one on a single spindle and two of the four for season two on the second spindle in the same first season set. The resr feature two discs on each spindle throughout the set. I ended up buying a four Blu-ray case and putting the artwork in it and not using the cardboard container that they came in (the holders were a little too thick). Be aware that the covers won't quite fit the thicker BD cases perfectly but they are pretty close.

Evidently some folks received sets with missing discs or doubles of the same disc. I would check yours as soon as they arrive. Mill Creek has indicated they are aware of the problem and have corrected it but there could be some sets out there that might be flawed.

I will give Mill Creek credit for putting this out with the original music but it would have been nice to get subtitles (as I recall the Netflix version had subtitles and they could have been licensed it from them). Don't get me wrong,  I'm happy with having the show in high def but I would have preferred a bit more effort put into the transfer with color correction, correct aspect ratio for the single episode end I mentioned earlier. As it is, this looks pretty much like the Netflix version that aired there so I can only assume that the same source was used (since the same flaws exist).

Overall, Mill Creek (which is a budget label) has done a good job here but, I suspect, QL fans would have paid a little more to get the show in perfect quality including a couple of commentary tracks (if you look you can find some podcasts online for a couple,of episodes featuring cast and production staff). A retrospective featurette would have been cool, too but I'm happy to have the set.

Otherwise, this would have been a perfect collection, with the actual proper music when compared to the DVD sets.

I still have a vhs recording from way back in '93 where the episodes are simply titled ""Return"" and ""Revenge"" and aired as a single 2 hour episode instead of 2 separate episodes.  And while I haven't watched it yet, I can say from just looking at the disc label, that they have done the same thing with the season 3 premiere, ""The Leap Home."" On the same note, during the closing moments of the series finale, Sam Beckett is spelled with only one ""T"" instead of the 2 it was during original broadcast.  I know these are very minor instances, but they still bother me a little and shows just how much nbc despised this show where they couldn't even give  Mill Creek true masters.",1486684800,3,959,4.335195530726257
4894902,4,B005UXJEUY,"As any true fan knows, Quantum Leap has had a tumultuous history on home video ever since NBC Universal began releasing seasons on DVD starting in 2004.  Not only was much of the original music replaced by generic elevator music, but the episodes were also issued on double-sided discs, which were easily prone to scratches and fingerprints.  In 2014, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-Leap-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00MN9PQBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum Leap: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;DVD collection was released, this time on single sided discs, but the music omissions remained.  In 2017, Mill Creek Entertainment debuted the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-Leap-The-Complete-Series/dp/B01MY5JRSX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum Leap: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;blu-ray collection with the promise that ""the vast majority of the original music has been restored.""  Having purchased the blu-ray release, this reviewer can confirm that this is indeed the case!  The final scene of the classic M.I.A. episode now has the ""Georgia On My Mind"" song reinstated in all its glory.  It's quite telling that a small company like Mill Creek was willing to pay the hefty music licensing fees while a giant corporation like NBC Universal was not.  This shouldn't be too surprising since they also didn't appreciate the series during its original broadcast run, having almost canceled it after season 3 until a letter writing campaign brought it back for an additional 2 seasons.

As far as the technical aspects of the release, the picture is in its original full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio while the audio is in DTS-HD 2.0.  There are 18 discs total spanning all 5 seasons of 97 episodes with 2 discs for season 1 and 4 discs for each of the remaining seasons.  This collection comes in a cardboard outer slipcover housing five standard sized hard plastic blu-ray cases.  Unfortunately, the discs are stacked one on top of the other with 2 discs on each side of the case.  It's a shame that Mill Creek did not go with the standard flip tray cases instead as that is far more convenient when removing discs.  The picture quality, while not remastered, is still the best this series has ever looked and is a definite upgrade from the previous DVD releases.  There are no bonus features, but having much of the original music back more than makes up for this omission.

While it might sound clich&eacute;, Quantum Leap was indeed a show ahead of its time.  It was willing to take chances with every aspect of its storytelling while providing heart warming stories with love, humor, tragedy, and more.  At the forefront, of course, were the brilliant performances by Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell.  No other actors could possibly have endeared themselves to the fans as easily and as quickly as these two.  In a time when Hollywood seems to be running thin on original ideas, one wonders why this classic series has yet to be revisited in some capacity.  Perhaps it's for the best, since few of these remakes ever manage to capture the splendor of the original.  In closing, despite not receiving the V.I.P. treatment of some other big name shows, Mill Creek's budget-friendly blu-ray release should still appeal to fans wanting to relive these timeless stories.",1486598400,263,3368,5.4508670520231215

4894904,5,B005UXJEUY,"Pay no attention to those claiming that the transfer to HD for Blu-ray is lousy or inferior in some way.  These episodes were transferred from the only copies of these episodes available.  And they were authored very professionally.  There is astonishing detail here and a wonderful color pallet.  And while there is film grain in some shots (and even occasionally entire scenes,) this was caused by the reality of what you see here being the best materials currently available for authoring.  These ARE the Universal masters of these episodes.  Many people may not believe that, but I confirmed it with both Universal and Mill Creek.  Also, the buyer/viewer should be aware that second and even third generation prints often evidence a film grain that was occasionally seen of some TV shows of this era.  And this is the case with the Mill Creek Quantum Leap Blu-Ray Set.  No amount of remastering will change that.  It's still going to be there.  The photographic style chosen on any television show, often produces effects sometimes attributed to a badly mastered image.  And while this show does not look as good as CBS's release of Star Trek: The Next Generation, it is important for you to take note of the vast distance in the style of the cinematography used here, as opposed to the completely different look of Star Trek: The Next Generation.  A show photographed mostly with more expensive film grains, as the budget was higher.  With Quantum Leap, what you see is termed 'guerrilla filmmaking.'  i.e. they photographed this show by the seat of their pants, and on slightly cheaper film stock, knowing fully well that the image would never be perfect; but that it would be offset by the a certain artistic integrity.  So please keep this in mind when considering your purchase here, because A) this is the best these episodes are ever going to look, and B) they look very, very good.  Even magical.

Also, I quickly went through various episodes which are infamous for having music replaced, which completely altered the wonderful mood created with the use of those original songs ... and I can report that all of those original songs appear to be in evidence here.  Please note: none of the special features from the Universal DVD sets are ported over here.  But even without any special features to speak of, this is going to turn out to be one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year.  I heartily recommend it.  Especially to longtime fans of the show.

4894921,4,B005UXJEUY,"Picture quality isn't up to usual 1080p Blu-ray standards, but what did we expect given the age of this TV series (yet, frankly, if they can take The Dick Van Dyke Show from the early 1960s, or Lost in Space from the mid 1960s, or even The X-Files from the 1990s/2000s and render all three in pristine, jaw-dropping Blu-ray clarity, why wouldn't they have been able to do that with this late 1980s/early 1990s TV series?).

The Blu-ray edition is quite a few notches above the DVD edition. It's very good. Of that, I am certain, and pleased.

And, so far, the original music seems to be intact in the episodes we've watched.

My rating of 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the sound: Stereo - not Multi-channel movie, or 5.1 Surround, or anything other than Stereo.

At first, that was off-putting because the split in the voices - coming from left or right speaker (instead of the center-channel as primary, plus left and right speakers as needed) creates great clarity, but a somewhat detached and ""fake"" listening experience. It's in-your-face sound (especially regarding voices) but that makes it somewhat distracting. I don't recall the DVDS being that way.

I've looked everywhere, even on the Mill Creek web site. I can find no information about how the sound was coded. No reference at all to the sound, in fact.

My receiver is a Denon. Brand new. It automatically selects sound output based on the coding of the DVD or Blu-ray. There's also an override feature that lets me pick sound output. But there are only two ways to play these Quantum Leap Blu-rays: Stereo or Direct. Both have more in common with CDs than movies.

Has anyone else experienced this? Can anyone else play these back using a different mode?

Or, can anyone find information somewhere that explains how these Blu-rays were coded for sound reproduction?

Other than a kind of limited, odd sound quality, what I've seen so far is good - much better than expected, in fact, given that this is Mill Creek - a company known for its shoddy work.",1484265600,3,2022,4.673239436619719

4894969,4,B005UXJEUY,"I ordered this remastered version of the complete series with some trepedition because of the many comments about the quality of the American version of the tapes. I found this to be better than expected, with the viewing quality good for the most part.  The glaring omission, of course, is ""Georgia"" missing from MIA, which is so integral to that episode and to Al's story. There are some other minor problems with the music score in some episodes, but not glaringly so.  The Leap Home, VietNam, and other favorites thank goodness are intact. Then we come to Season 5 and my disappointment has to do with the storyline, specifically the last episode. This is a moot point all these years later, and nothing can be done about it, but it is so out of place with the rest of the series. In most series, if and when they get to season 5, the writing and storyline falls apart. The Trilogy (very powerful) saves this season and also gives a glimmer of hope that Sam will get home. Shame on you Donald Bellisario, for leaving Sam stranded in time and in such a desolate place.

4894977,4,B005UXJEUY,"I wish I could give 4.5 stars rather than having to choose between 4 and 5. The half-star off is only because IMHO the quality of the writing fell off somewhat in the fifth season. The season 1-4 episodes are as perfect as anything ever shown on tv. However, some of the season 5 episodes are overworked (for lack of a better term) almost as if they were running out of good ideas... to the point at which they started just crossing the line into being campy.

Now, perhaps that was the writers' intention with those episodes -- especially the one in the womens' prison, and the vampires episode -- but they do contrast so much with the others that I suspect they are a byproduct of the idea-well running dry.

The final episode, to me, is another example of this. It is fractured and seems like a desperate attempt to cobble together something out of bits and pieces.  I have to say I was very disappointed in the ending, even though of the two main characters Al (Dean Stockwell) was my favorite; I don't quibble with that part of it. But it seems to me that Sam got a very raw deal ... which has to be a letdown for fans who were rooting for him to be ""rewarded"" for all of his efforts.

Most of the season 5 episodes were excellent and of the quality I'd come to expect (both writing and acting)... which is why I'd like to give it 4.5 stars: One for every perfect season, and a half -star for the season that could and should have been as good as its predecessors...  but just didn't quite measure up.",1438128000,2,1506,4.288732394366197

I hate flip discs and they were the worse thing that ever happened to complete season sets since the thick cardboard flip out cases. So you get neither of those annoying things with this set.

The show started out with struggling ratings when it debuted in mid season back in the Spring of 1989, but then the ratings improved when it hit its 2nd Season in the Fall of 1989, but then the ratings took another nosedive in its 5th Season resulting in its cancellation in the Spring of 1993.

Perhaps this will change now that Scott Bakula is on TV's #1 new drama, but unlikely because they have so much inventory of the original DVDs left.  SO...

If you're a Leaper, don't think, just buy this set (I'm a hard core fan since the original run on NBC and was even inspired to pursue a degree in history because of this show and have even been blessed to meet Scott and Dean and thank them for inspiring me).

Look at it this way, do you want high quality discs in a nice box with the original music?  I'm talking Blondie on ""Another Mother"" and RAY FREAKING CHARLES on ""MIA""?  Would you pay $50 more to ensure you could enjoy this properly?  If the answer is yes, then you owe it to yourself to pick this up.  Simply add a secondary or external computer BluRay/DVD drive to your order (if you don't have one already), set it to region 2 and forget about it (never mind the fact that you can now enjoy DVDs from the UK anytime you want now).  Sit back, put the SINGLE LAYER discs in one by one and enjoy the series as it was meant to be.

4895038,4,B005UXJEUY,"Quantum Leap is a great show. Well written for its time and still today, well acted and a very unique blend of drama, soap opera elements and science-fiction. I'm not gonna spend a ton of time reviewing it, you likely already know about it if you're looking at the complete series DVD. What I wanted to review is this new complete collection and how it fares on DVD and as a re-release.

Quantum Leap was originally packaged in fold-out cardboard cases and burned onto double-sided discs. Double-sided discs are notoriously buggy and often degrade faster than normal DVDs, plus are much easier to scratch and damage. Cardboard fold-out cases take up a lot more room than a normal DVD case and also damage easier, plus they are more of a hassle to open and access. The good news about this new complete series set is that ALL the discs are one-sided, and all five seasons come in thin plastic DVD cases of normal width. This saves a lot of shelf space and keeps your discs much more protected, which is a great benefit over the older releases.

The DVDs themselves are of normal quality for an 80's/90's show on DVD. I have read some comments that the later seasons are of lower quality than seasons one and two but I don't see that drop in quality at all. The whole series looks nice and clean for the most part, but many establishing shots, special effects shots and stock footage sections look much grainier and worn. This is pretty common for older shows. Special features are almost non-existant, also like most old TV releases, but what's there (interviews mainly on season one) is interesting.

Sound quality... well, it sounds crisp and fine for the most part, but as you no doubt have read already there is a music replacement issue on seasons two, three and four. Honestly a lot of it isn't a big deal, background music I barely missed, but there are a few key scenes where the music replacement is really harmful to the show. The best example of this is ""Georgia"" in the season two finale, and the songs in a radio DJ episode. How much this will bother you depends on the person, but for me ""Georgia"" is the only big miss. I wish Universal had just paid for that song, and I have to take off a full star for it not being there.

All in all this cheap complete series bundle is about as good as you could expect an 80's series to be handled on DVD, especially in these days of slowing down DVD sales numbers and HD content. Only the missing songs really harm this release, and it's up to you whether that's worth dealing with. For me this is a great set to have on the shelf and I've been watching an episode or two a night all week since getting it. A great trip down memory lane with a show that definitely still holds up.",1421539200,15,2733,4.416666666666667

4895040,4,B005UXJEUY,"Although there are some music artist deletions/substitutions in some of the shows, I still like having these DVDs in my collection. The main premise/storyline of each show is still intact making this set a good value at $75.00.

The picture quality is pretty good and the (even substituted) sound and songs are clear and in stereo. The set comes with each season in its own DVD case all together in a hard cardboard holder box.

4895051,4,B005UXJEUY,"Note that this review is for the Complete series repackage and released in November 2014.

Soapbox comment- it would be nice if Amazon separated media reviews for the exact media being sold - this is NOT a European PAL release as the current most helpful review suggests.  Step up your game, Amazon!

Back to the dvd set - it just arrived yesterday but I checked out my areas of concern, for those interested in comparing to the previous released, there is good and bad-

The good - No flipper discs, these are single sided dvds!  Nice.

The bad- It appears that the content is identical to the original discs, lousy music cue replacements and all.  Get it together Universal, can you give this awesome show some respect like other tv releases such Shout! s WKRP in Cincinnati and the huge Batman release.  This was just lazy and disrespectful.

Sam goes back in time and fixes the problems that once went wrong, changes the lives of the people he leaps into and those around him.

He saves many lives with his leaps, saves marriages, babies, even animals. He was a chimp, a pregnant teen, a black man during segregation on the south in the 1950s, he was himself as a boy, in his brothers Vietnam squad, he as AL! and Lee Harvey Oswald.",1415404800,,709,4.028368794326241
4895059,3,B005UXJEUY,"Quantum Leap is my favorite TV series of all time.  I watched and taped every single episode in junior high and high school, and re-watched them to about the point of shame.  I've probably seen each episode at least fifty times.  Some hold up better than others, some are a lot cornier than I remember, and a few are downright painful (""Dr. Ruth"").  But it's mostly magical: Five-star television like ""The Color of Truth"",  ""Camikazi Kid"", ""Jimmy"", ""Catch a Falling Star"", ""Pool Hall Blues"", ""The Leap Home"", ""The Leap Home Part II - Vietnam"", ""Mirror Image"", to name a few, and my all-time favorite, the masterpiece ""M.I.A"".  Dr. Sam Beckett is the ultimate male role model; smart, unbiased, tough and compassionate.  Scott Bakula is supremely talented and perfect in the role, and Dean Stockwell is the personification of cool.  The show increased my mindfulness of and complemented my opinions of so many things including friendship/loyalty, honesty/honor, racism/prejudice, discrimination, sexism, animal rights, and just plain humanity.  I certainly learned more watching it than I ever did going to social studies class... or any class, come to think of it.  It can be outwardly P.C. at times, but never to the point of insulting one's intelligence.  Sam and Al are such exemplary role models that the series should be playing on a loop in juvie halls.

So as we all know, with the exception of Season 1, a lot of the DVD transfers are quite lacking.  Tragically, the discs present the show as what looks like at least a second-generation syndication master (Season 5 is the worst offender -- practically unwatchable).  To anyone who's experiencing the show for the first time with the DVDs: No, it did not look this bad when originally broadcast.  It was as crisp and vivid as any pre-HD network show from the time.  Processed shots with special effects were never as glaring as they look on the discs (it's always evident when there's going to be an effect because the picture quality nosedives -- you could not see them coming as originally broadcast).  My old VHS copies of the first-runs were more faithful representations than what you're buying here, and that is not an exaggeration.  I will say that this issue mostly plagues the Season 4 and 5 sets.  There are some other things botched by the DVDs that are of note:

- ""Play It Again, Seymour"" has the Season 2 opening credits despite being a Season 1 episode (Netflix has the correct credits)
- ""Trilogy Parts II & III"" were originally broadcast as a double-length episode simply titled ""Trilogy Part II""
- ""Return/Revenge of the Evil Leaper"" were originally a double-length episode titled ""Evil Leaper II: Return/Revenge""

For some reason, instead of giving us those episodes as originally shown, an individual at Universal made the choice to give us the split syndication versions.  It's almost as if those responsible for the product don't know anything about the show, and couldn't be bothered to google the original air dates to do this right.  Hmmm...

And of course there's the music replacement that affects a lot of episodes (except Season 1).  It kills ""M.I.A.""; utterly destroys it.  This is why I bought the U.K. versions of Seasons 2-3, along with a region-free player a while back.  This is how much I love the show and want to have the episodes as intact as possible.  I haven't watched the fake version of ""Good Morning, Peoria"", but I'm sure that it's also destroyed.  I can't think of any significant musical moments in Seasons 4-5 that would be affected, so I'm content with the region 1 DVDs for those.  Note that Netflix currently has the unaltered version of ""M.I.A."" although the DVD does not.  Infuriating.

Also worth noting is that most if not all Season 1 episodes had re-done special effects when they were rerun on NBC.  The DVD correctly presents the original effects such as the ""non-electrical"" Leap (the simple blue filter, later firefly-like sparks) and the invisible Imaging Chamber Door.  But by the time the signature Leap effect had been implemented (early into Season 2) and the white glowing door was in use (""What Price, Gloria?""), NBC actually went back and updated the effects for Season 1 for reruns to keep them consistent with new episodes.  Those effects should have been presented as bonus features, or as an alternate way to view the episode, but sadly, most are nowhere (you can see the alternate Leap-in to ""Camikazi Kid"" on a Season 2 episode).  A lot of these were beautiful, for example the alternate Leap-out for ""Play It Again, Seymour"".  This was the pre-digital era, so we're talking frame-by-frame artistry.

Also, to those complaining that Sam sometimes Leaps into reruns on the DVDs, I actually appreciate that the shows aren't edited to flow together, as it wouldn't be the original way they were broadcast.  Also worth noting is that all the different saga cells (""Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime..."") are correctly represented, unlike in syndication where the Season 4 cell was tacked onto every episode from the first three seasons.  Season 5, however, used a slightly different saga cell for its first few episodes when originally broadcast, but the cell used for the rest of the season is applied to all episodes.  The differences were minor footage changes, except the default Leap-out shot into the new episode was from ""A Single Drop of Rain"" before it reverted to the iconic Leap from ""So Help Me God"".  The ""Rain"" saga cell hasn't been seen since first broadcast, I assume, and will probably never be seen again unless it's on YouTube.

It'd be a miracle if the show got an HD restoration at this point, but I'd be thrilled with just a clean, color-corrected transfer of the broadcast masters (sometimes the Leaps actually look green, or pure white).  Tragically, they're probably decaying somewhere in a warehouse.  Ugh, painful.

So here's what's new with The Complete Series set:

NOTHING.  Well, almost nothing.  The transfers are still crummy syndication masters for the episode content, and there's no music reinstatement.  You do get:

A new slipcase to house the condensed DVD cases.  Less shelf space is a plus.  The artwork has Sam wearing a contemporary outfit that he never wore in the series.  Brilliant minds at work here.

All single-sided DVDs!  Yes, the double-sideds have been replaced.  A plus for most of you, but I've never had a problem with a double-sided disc and I've been collecting for 14 years.  The plus for me: Each case after Season 1 holds six discs, so I just swapped out Seasons 2 and 3 for my U.K. DVDs with no music replacement.  Voila.  I'm happy with my memories of clear episodes and sharp special effects until someone at Universal realizes that the show is a jewel that needs to be properly preserved. If that day comes, I'll buy it all over again.",1415404800,87,6858,4.866264020707506

*UPDATE REVIEW FOR THE NEW QUANTUM LEAP 27 DVD BOXSET (NOT THE BUNDLE)*

Well... it kinda is a bundle inside a new slipcase.

Amazon bundled all the Quantum Leap bundle/boxset reviews together so I couldn't just do a review for the new set, hence the update here. I left the original review below this for anyone looking at the 1-5 bundle.

When I first heard the news of the new boxset, I was elevated thinking that all the past wrongs with these dvds have been righted. Then I hit the ground hard when I heard what we will be getting. I wanted to pass this along so no one gets suckered into buying this. These are the exact same transfers (music substitutions and all) as the original dvd releases. The only difference is the slipcase and all of the dvds will be single-sided (no more flippers is a plus).

If you do not own the original releases, this boxset with all single-sided dvds is the way to go. I'm considering getting the new set just for the single-sided dvds when the price drops to the $30-$40 range. My original flippers still play fine so I can wait.

On that note, there are so many people that are not as lucky and have bad flipper dvds that no longer play. It is too bad Universal doesn't offer a trade in program where the defective dvds can be exchanged for the new single-sided dvds.

I really wish Universal took the care to release a box set with all single sided AND with ALL the original music restored like the UK dvds.

That is what the fans really want.

*REVIEW FOR THE QUANTUM LEAP SEASONS 1-5 BUNDLE*

5 stars for this awesome series but why buy this bundle?

These are the same sets that have already been released, same music substitutions and all. If you already own these, there is no need to buy this.

If you don't own any of the sets, you are better off buying them individually and save yourself some $$$. I've seen these sets at B&M Walmart and Target for $10-$12 a season. You can pick them up on Amazon in the $10-$20 range. Why spend nearly $140 bucks for this bundle when you can get the same thing piece meal for $50-$100?

I really wish Universal took the care to release an actual box set and not just a bundle of  the old sets. They could have released a nice boxset with all single sided dvds instead of the flipper discs that so many people had problems with. (For the record, my sets all played fine) and with all the original music restored like the UK dvds.

That is what the fans really want.",1400630400,13,2654,4.418891170431212

I especially like that you only get to see the person he has become when he looks in a mirror.

The stories have lessons, subtly folded in and not shoved down your throat. A couple favorites were where he meets a young Michael Jackson and gives him a couple ""MJ signature moves"" and when he jumped into himself as a teen and then jumps forward to save his brother's life. I so wish this series was still running. Come back Sam/Scott. I miss you. Thank you for a wonderful adventure nonetheless.

4895116,5,B005UXJEUY,"My mother, back when she was in her 80's, and I loved this show. I hope she still loves it. By now, she's met and thanked Dean Stockwell (Al) for his character's shenanigans and how he helped Sam out every week.

MY RECOMMENDATION

If you like stories about angels, not knowing they're angels, helping others ...

If you like shows about time travel ...

If you like shows that include scientific mumbo-jumbo ...

you'll love this show.

Sam's experiment to move in time works, but, at the same time, goes awry,

Sam finds himself inside a person's body, and everyone else sees him as that person, but we see him as Sam, which can be hilarious at times when he becomes a person with no legs, or becomes a frenzied mother.

He must figure out why he is there, with Al's help,  then solve that problem before he can leave, hoping to go back home.

Sometimes, we see the anti-Sam character, who tries to mess everything up.

Sam becomes convinced that God is controlling his jumps, using him to make right what has gone wrong. And yes, eventually, Sam meets God, but I won't give away more than that.

Quantum Leap is a wonderful show. I'm glad to finally own all five seasons. I've even read a few of the books.",1399939200,11,1209,4.420814479638009

4895119,5,B005UXJEUY,"We love this series.  I won't bore you with a complete description of how Sam ""leaps"" from person to person, righting wrongs in their lives and changing history in the process - you can read about that in other reviews.

I want to briefly mention a few things about the PAL format and viewing PAL discs.  First, if you didn't realize it, some episodes contain copyrighted music which was dubbed over with generic songs in the American NTSC format release.  The UK release (region 2, PAL format) has these songs intact due to more lenient copyright rules in the UK.  Also, the PAL format has slightly better resolution than the NTSC format.  Some players may actually play these PAL format discs and convert the signal to the American NTSC format.  Also, many modern TV's will play a PAL signal even if the player is region free but doesn't convert the PAL to NTSC.  Assuming those aren't an option for you, an easy way to view PAL is to use a computer (we have a home theater PC output to a projector) with a dedicated region 2 DVD drive.  You must go into device manager and go to the ""region"" tab of the DVD drive.  There, you can usually change the region code up to 4 or 5 times before it permanently sets the region code for the drive.  One more important thing to note:  The sound will be slightly sped up if the computer's graphic output is set to 60Hz refresh as most monitors and TVs are.  Set the refresh to 50 Hz (25Hz works, too, assuming your monitor can output it), and the audio should now be at the proper speed.  Most video cards and many monitors and TV's should be able to play a 50Hz video signal.  It works for us, but our computer graphics and projector can output individual Hz from 20Hz up to 60Hz so we can watch movies at 24Hz or TV at 60Hz or PAL at 25Hz or 50Hz.  Just be sure to check your video card  specs and your monitor.  Apparently, neither of my computer monitors can do 50Hz, but again, my projector (Benq w1070) can.  As long as the region for the DVD drive is set to region 2, windows media center can play it.  It will even present it at 60Hz for any monitor or TV.  Just remember the sound will be sped up, almost like they are talking using helium, but if you can get your monitor and video card to put out a 50Hz signal, all will sound (and look) right.

I hope these tips will help others to enjoy region 2 PAL discs.  Good luck.",1395100800,57,2373,4.259507829977629

4895135,5,B005UXJEUY,"""Quantum Leap"" is the very first sci-fi show that I had ever watched as a kid. I first got my television set in my room and I turned on the channel to this show, which hooked me immediately. Each episode is a story of its own and it didn't requires me to go from the very beginning of the show to ""understand"" it. The very fact that the main character (Sam Beckett played by Scott Bakula) was experiencing such confusion at the beginning of every episode is the same fact of my own confusion of every episode as a kid. It wasn't until I purchased the seasons elsewhere in the last few years that I finally understood the main issue: he was trying to get back to his own time, to home.

The other main thing that interests me so much about this show is the idea of ""what-ifs"" where one can change what went wrong (altering the timeline ""for the better""). There's no anticipation involved - all leads to chances and what-ifs. Sam never knew who he will end up in being. It's all unknown and uncontrolled and adaptability is not an option - it's required. But, he had a hope that his next leap would be ""a leap home.""

8487150,5,B005UXJEUY,"I have been a HUGE Quantum Leap fan since I watched it during its run on NBC. I always wanted it on DVD but found myself disappointed by the picture and the removal of certain songs. I gave up until I found this gem! The picture looks great on the blu-ray set I purchased, but special features are non-existent. The latter didn't bother me, but it may others. The packaging is bargain, with the blu-rays being being stacked on top of each other on both sides of the case. Since this is a Mill Creek product thats not surprising. Its a small sacrifice to be able to watch episodes like The Camakazi Kid & Trilogy in a quality picture. If you're a fan, buy this now!",1525737600,2,664,4.277777777777778
