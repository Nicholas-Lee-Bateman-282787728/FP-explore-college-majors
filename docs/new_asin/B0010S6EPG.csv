8238359,1,B0010S6EPG,"I'm on maternity leave right now and wanted to get back into working out. I do boot camp type workouts normally, but wanted a little more cardio. I found this DVD set at Marshalls and decided to try it out. It was too easy, I didn't even break a sweat doing both workouts. It's probably a good workout for beginners, but not for me.",1271116800,2,332,4.203125
8238360,4,B0010S6EPG,"I've been a Tae Bo fan since the first set of videos came out. The original video is still my favorite (from 1998) but these ones are great, too. Not as intense as I expected, but that's good. I was worried that they'd be so hard that I wouldn't be able to finish a full workout for a while (like his bootcamp videos are). Both have a perfect level of intensity and keep you moving the whole time. :)",1266796800,2,400,4.075949367088608
8238361,4,B0010S6EPG,"This is an very good workout that will have you sweating.  The only issue I have with this set is that both workouts are almost identical, so much so when I put the Sculpt workout into my DVD it began at the end as if I had put the Cardio workout back into the player. Being the owner of tons of Tae Bo workouts, I understand that most moves are pretty basic, but these sets feel the exact same, like two cardio workouts.  Overall great workout but I feel duped because I feel like I paid to see the team just change clothes.",1262649600,,525,4.087378640776699
