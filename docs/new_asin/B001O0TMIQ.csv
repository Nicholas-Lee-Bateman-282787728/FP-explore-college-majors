3725207,5,B001O0TMIQ,"If your child is like mine, you have lots of Thomas DVDs; and if your over 35, you will Love this Series.  The first episodes are the best; they are the only ones written by the original author (the Rev.), they introduce each engine to the team, and Ringo Starr is the narrator.  Also, they are the only ones to call Sir Toppam Hatt by his original name, The Fat Controller (later US releases actually over-dubbed this to be more P.C.).  Its fun, its cheeky, the stories have the best content, the best models & crashes.  We love it.",1293926400,4,533,4.353535353535354

3725209,5,B001O0TMIQ,"Every 2-4 yr old seems to love Thomas and Friends.  Great narration, good story line, nice pace, entrancing animation.  Buy one or more.",1255392000,2,136,4.869565217391305
3725220,5,B001O0TMIQ,My preschooler enjoys watching these films so much. Each story is short (about 5 minutes long) and the dvd continues to play through story after story without me having to prompt it with a remote. I enjoy the old school Thomas with the model trains and claymation faces. Also enjoy hearing Ringo Starr narrating. Such a good buy!,1393113600,,329,4.689655172413793
3725221,5,B001O0TMIQ,"I will be honest and say that I have NO USE for the current renditions of ""Thomas"" that are done with the computer imaging. My interest is more from the standpoint of a model railroader and can appreciate the work and intricate detail that went into the production of the early episodes. I also felt it was great that guys like Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin didn't consider it beneath them to perform the story telling.",1391212800,,434,4.576923076923077
3725222,4,B001O0TMIQ,"We once had a video of Beatrix Potter stories that bored us to death.  Our neighbor boy wanted to watch it, despite our warnings.  He watched 5 minutes of it and then ran out the door screaming and never wanted to play at our house again.  His mother said he said our house was too boring for him.  That is how Ringo Star's narrations affect me.  However,  my daughter loves Thomas and Friends no matter who narrates,  so even though she does not prefer Ringo Starr,  she gives this 4 stars.",1389312000,,491,4.318681318681318
3725223,5,B001O0TMIQ,So happy to find Thomas DVDs from the early years.  My son collects them and it is a real treat for him to add to his collection.,1388793600,,129,3.7777777777777777
3725224,5,B001O0TMIQ,"My two sons loved these early stories of Thomas and his friends. If your children enjoy trains, these trains have personalities. In fact, one of my sons wanted to change his name to Gordon as that was his favorite train.  As these stories were written by a Reverend, they have a subtle message which supports good character and virtue.  The vocabulary is a little richer than the average childhood story.  My sons could sit for hours and watch these.  Ringo Starr was a fun plus to these episodes. Even adults can enjoy these episodes.",1385078400,,535,4.659574468085107
3725225,5,B001O0TMIQ,"Baby loves it.  Good original physical train set, not the new animation non-sense.  Ringo Starr is the best narrator.  Would have been nice to get all of the episodes.  It appears to be missing a few of the contiguous episodes.  Oh well, the baby doesn't care.",1384214400,,260,4.565217391304348
3725226,5,B001O0TMIQ,"I lament the fact that Shining Time Station isn't available anywhere, but at least my son can see the Railway Series shorts narrated by Ringo Starr that I enjoyed so much as a kid!

I'm not a fan of the all CGI Thomas & Friends that currently airs on PBSKids. They seem to have lost the fundamentally British feel in the storytelling, and have strayed far and wide from the tenor of the original books and early short films. The Thomas merchandising empire is also grating, and I'm quite annoyed to see Thomas referred to as ""Thomas the Train"" here and there and among parents--no! He's Thomas the TANK ENGINE. And furthermore, Thomas was but a part of the railway ensemble that made up Thomas and Friends. James, Edward, Percy, Gordon and Toby were often far more interesting to me than cheeky brash Thomas anyway!

What you'll find here in this set are the model railroad films that illustrate many of the adventures from the books, along with a few other stories. Thomas is back to his cheeky self, always overestimating himself and getting into jams (just like children often do!). I wish the American ""Shining Time Station"" framework were also available, or the years with George Carlin narrations, but these episodes will make you nostalgic and happy and still captivate your little ones, so everyone wins, in my opinion.

Especially if your child is excited about model railways or real train engines/train cars, as I was when I was a girl, these will be a big hit.",1383091200,11,1472,4.6976744186046515
3725227,5,B001O0TMIQ,We love the early years of Thomas and our grandson loves it too.  These early years ones are so much better than the modern Thomas.  These were the episodes our son watched when he was young.  Love the narrations of Ringo Starr & George Carlin.,1377648000,,244,4.377777777777778
3725228,5,B001O0TMIQ,My 3 year old will not stop watching them. Excellent choice if you have a Thomas fan in the house.,1375833600,,98,3.95
3725229,5,B001O0TMIQ,"These stories, many of them pretty direct adaptations of the Railway Series, represent some of the best in the series. With Ringo Starr narrating, and the world's craftsmanship shining, these episodes hold up well despite being almost 30 years old.

There's probably not enough action for kids younger than 2 or older than 8, but most kids between those ages (and their parents) should enjoy these stories.",1375056000,,406,5.059701492537314
3725240,5,B001O0TMIQ,"A joy to watch...and to remember fondly.  The tech values and efx are not what kids today would expect, but the wonderfully told tales of friendship are timeless and rare.",1370563200,,171,4.7
3725241,5,B001O0TMIQ,"I've grown up watching Thomas, so when I saw that they no longer make the ""Real"" train series I was REALLY sad! I'm really not into the new CGI series and I think it ruins a lot of what was fun about the show to begin with. I'm really glad I was able to find this DVD of  a lot of the episodes I remembered growing up. My kids love Thomas and I'd much rather them watch these episodes then the CGI ones. It's just so much more imaginative to me!",1361923200,,445,3.89010989010989
3725242,5,B001O0TMIQ,This was a Christmas gift to my grandson :)  My boys grew up with Thomas the Train & so will my Grandson :) I am sure when he gets a little older he will enjoy these & I will continue to get him Thomas the Train DVD's :),1357430400,,220,3.5833333333333335
3725243,5,B001O0TMIQ,This is definitely a crucial set for the Thomas and Friends fan in your house! Timeless stories your child will enjoy watching again and again! It's really fun to see how each individual engine started out and learn about their own stories! We are thrilled with this purchase; I highly recommend it!,1332979200,,299,4.769230769230769
3725244,5,B001O0TMIQ,"To quote another reviewer, ""Toddlers and preschoolers will want these dvds over and over and over again!"" - forgot to add in ""and their train-loving parent"" too! I really enjoy the shows for the excellent model railroading skills the producers used in making the show. Supremely realistic model work, scenery, and operation. In these shows, when the train are running along the tracks, they are actually PULLING A TRAIN, unlike some of the new computer generated shows where the trains just run around all day, apparently not doing the work that locomotives do, which is PULL TRAINS! I'm still waiting for the complete 2nd season - I bought this set years and years ago, and so far no season 2 yet.",1327449600,8,698,4.776859504132231
3725245,4,B001O0TMIQ,"I was hoping this would be like the ones I had seen when I was a kid.  They are only the Thomas videos although.  What I was thinking was ""Shining Time Station"" where the kids at the station have a problem, and Ringo Starr (Mr. Conductor) comes out and tells them how Thomas had a similar problem and they show what happened on the Island of Sodor.  Then they would go back to the station (which was real people).  Still, it's the original Thomas segments and my son is loving it already.",1325116800,9,488,4.271739130434782
3725246,5,B001O0TMIQ,"This is the Thomas DVD. Ringo narrates them all and his referrences to the ""Fat Controller"" in his thick accent are hysterical. This covers all the earliest Thomas episodes in chronological order.",1319760000,,196,5.15625
3725247,5,B001O0TMIQ,"This is a very charming start to the whole Thomas phenom.  I love the old-school animation style with actual figures and NO computer assistance.  Ringo Starr is great voicing for the programs.  If the second season is like this, I would get that series too.

Toddlers/preschoolers will want these dvds over and over and over again!",1302048000,,331,4.857142857142857
3725248,5,B001O0TMIQ,"If you dislike the new cartoonish Thomas videos, this is the one you want. These are the closest video versions of the original stories I have found. They are narrated by Ringo Starr, and best of all no annoying commercials.",1294617600,16,224,4.625
3725249,5,B001O0TMIQ,"I searched the internet for a DVD that included the Thomas stories my sons watched on public television on Shining Time Station.  We had video tapes that had been played countless hours and as my sons grew, I gave those to my nephew.  They were given away as he outgrew them.  I wanted to find the""real"" Thomas stories for my grandson, and I found them!  Thanks!",1294444800,3,362,4.4393939393939394
8328667,4,B001O0TMIQ,"This is definitely a must-have for any Thomas fan. This set contains the first season of Thomas & Friends, fully restored (there's a few mastering errors here and there, but nothing too noticable). It comes on three discs. The first two contain the episodes, while the third is designated for bonus features. Personally, I don't really care for the latter, but what's really nice is that the menu is deliberately designed after an Anchor Bay release, and I'm sure it will bring much nostalgia to anyone who grew up with them.

However, there's one major problem that prevents this from getting a 5 star, and that is that it only contains the original Ringo Starr narration with no way to switch to the inferior George Carlin narration, or, at the very least, Ringo's US redubs. I've tolerated the inconsistent narrations on Thomas releases, but there's no reason for it here, especially when different audio tracks is one of the most basic things to put on DVDs.

Overall, I definitely recommend this box set. There's definitely a reason it's sought after. Will there be another one like it? Who knows? But it's definitely a great release either way.",1503446400,,1150,4.83248730964467

8328674,3,B001O0TMIQ,"Thomas was the very first show I ever loved.  I was introduced to it through Shining Time Station, and while the rest of the show hasn't stood the test of time, the Thomas segments do.  Seasons 1-5 are all varying degrees of excellent, and seasons 6-7 aren't bad either.  In fact, I'd rank it as my favorite British cartoon apart from Danger Mouse.  I was looking forward to owning half of Ringo Starr's seasons on DVD, but it wasn't until much later I found out that he didn't narrate every episode of season 1.  The only one he missed was Whistles and Sneezes (for season 2 he only redubbed 16 out of 26 episodes).  So, rather than throw in the US version with George Carlin narrating it they just gave us the UK versions for all of them.  There are several differences (freight cars are called trucks, for instance) but they were all perfectly fine except for one- Sir Topham Hatt is called the Fat Controller.  I'm sorry but isn't it insulting to call your boss a name like that?  What kind of a lesson is that to teach kids?  Apart from that these are okay, but that really ruins it for me.  So I'll give it an average of 3 stars, 5 because it's the original Thomas and 1 because it's not the right version.  I know most of the episodes with Ringo's US narrations are on DVD, but they're only 7 on each individual DVD volume.  That was fine for a VHS tape, but for a DVD that's a measely amount.  I wish that they had just included them all in one collection.  I can understand why they haven't released a season 2 set, but they have no excuse for not doing any sets for seasons 3-5 as each of those seasons had the same narrator for every episode of it (Alec Baldwin for season 5 and George Carlin for seasons 3 and 4).  I guess they know that this fad will never go away and want to milk it for all its worth.  Still, no matter what I will always be a Thomas fan.  This is the easily the best preschool series ever in my humble opinion.  Make sure this is one of the first television series you show your children.",1410825600,,2021,4.216145833333333
