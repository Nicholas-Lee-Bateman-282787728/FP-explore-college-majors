8089446,5,B000BNTMGO,The golden age of Mexican films was arguably the best ever. This film is hilariouse and I've been trying to find it for a while now. I'm glad I found it. I love the service.,1371772800,,173,3.9714285714285715
8089447,5,B000BNTMGO,"This is such a great film.  I love Lola Beltran and she is not the best actress, but boy can she sing a song. She sings ""El Ramalazo"", ""La Joven Mancornadora, and all three do a great song, ""EL Augijon"".  Beautiful horses, great songs, a very funny story line, and a phenominal cast make this a great buy!",1231459200,,305,4.241379310344827
8089448,5,B000BNTMGO,Flor Sylvestre said in her interview after Antonio Aguilar's death that he was a practical joker.  He pulls a great one on the others in this movie.  The songs by Lola Beltran and Demetrio Gonzalez are as usual terrific as well as the performance of the horses they ride.  Very entertaining!,1184457600,,291,4.666666666666667
