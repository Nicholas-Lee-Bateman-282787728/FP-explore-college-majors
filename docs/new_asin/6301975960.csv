400626,3,6301975960,"The fifth installment of the famous ""Thin Man"" series is hampered by a change of directors and a very weak script, and the result is far from the standard the first four films in the series have led us to expect.  The primary issue here is the way in which the screenplay presents the character of Nora Charles; instead of giving us smart sophistocation, the script gives us a daffy loopiness, and the result is not so much fun as foolish, with Myrna Loy clearly uncomfortable with the lines in several scenes.
In spite of this, there are still elements to enjoy in this story of Nick and Nora's visit to Nick's hometown--where, naturally enough, they are soon confronted with a murder.  The Powell/Loy chemistry continues to have lots of crackle, and when not obstructed by the script Loy manages several very memorable moments.  The supporting cast is typically fine, featuring Lucille Watson, Harry Davenport, Anne Revere, and Gloria DeHaven. Fans of the series who are willing to overlook the tampering with Nora's character will enjoy it; newcomers, however, should select one of the earlier ""Thin Man"" films.",1009584000,9,1114,4.914893617021277
400627,5,6301975960,My Mom pointed me toward the Thin Man (among many other wonderful classic films) and I became an instant fan.  I am desperately awaiting the studios to release the whole series on DVD and bring some light to this wonderful cast and stories.,1003104000,4,240,4.5813953488372094
400628,5,6301975960,"This is my favorite film in ""The Thin Man series""  I really enjoyed it, and would highly recommend it.  It's great classic acting.

400629,3,6301975960,"This time Nick and Nora goes to see Nick's parents. Of course someone gets whacked and Nick has to solve the murder, now with the aim to impress his father whom obviously never has shown him any encouragement before,  regarding Nick's chosen profession as a sleuth. This is a Thin man film  with the usual ingredients wich we all know and love, except that Nick  stays sober as his parents don't approve of drinking. I would say though  that Nora (Myrna Loy) is not as funny and vibrant in this film as in some  of the others, wich dissapoints me a little. I like her character very much  in the other films, but here she's a bit wimpy to my taste. Well...the  murder gets solved of course and if you like the other Thin man films, this  will be an enjoyment too.",924566400,5,763,4.323943661971831

400718,5,6301975960,"Odd little film, Loy and POwell work well. The Loy short dresses, are beyond ugly and silly! All the 1930's dressing elegance is gone, it's 1940. The whole dynamic of their love story is changed, especially when Powell takes Loy over his knee and spanks her??? How repulsive! Boy, did this movie director have their story all wrong! Not a fan of this film, pretty trashy for this couple. Loy appears very, very thin as if she were or had been ill??
ASTA, is perfect as usual. Powell, is superb, but even he must have been like,  ""Why am I doing this silly film?

400873,4,6301975960,"One of the later in the Thin Man series, with that delightful repartee between Powell and Loy, and Asta's lovable hijinks. These movies are like potato chips; you can't just watch one (or two). It is a charming addiction and worth watching them all to see who is going to appear in a supporting role.",1481068800,,300,4.472727272727273
400874,5,6301975960,"With the war in its final phases and victory assured it was time for a new Thin Man movie.  Myrna Loy, who had alone among top Hollywood actresses given up her film career to help the was effort, agreed to sign on and the production was prepared. The last of the original production team, director Woody Van Dyke had died in 1943 and his place was taken by  Richard Thorpe who like Van Dyke was known to be quick, dependable and able to bring a picture in under budget, a trait highly valued by studio head Louis B. Mayer.

The original Dashell Hammett stories had ended back in 1936 with Another Thin Man so the writers were free to do as they chose with the Hammett characters as they had been with Shadow of the Thin Man. There was certainly some pressure not to get stale so in this, the fifth installment, rather than the switching of New York and San Francisco locations  that happened in the first four, the ""Thin Man"" was sent home to his birthplace, Sycamore Springs. Some people didn't like this, feeling that small town America didn't offer the glamorous settings that the big cities did, but I feel the choice worked perfectly. What better than to set the sophisticated Charles's down in Andy Hardy territory? It was a novel idea to have a murder mystery take place in the kind of place that was always presented as a paragon of American virtue, especially in the forties. The supporting cast as usual, is large and full of fine actors.

The town presented us with a whole  ew group of suspicious characters and town eccentrics, all of whom, of course, all of whom will be gathered together in the end to be cross-examined by Nick as Nora humorously comments on his technique, by now quite familiar with film audiences. every town has its skeletons and secrets and in Sycamore Springs everyone seems to have something to hide despite Nick's father , Dr. Bertram Charles ( well-played by Harry Davenport) , insisting that everyone there is on the up and up. A key element in the plot is how disappointed Dr. Charles is that his son didn't follow in his career footsteps and instead became a ""policeman"". Nora wants something to happen to allow Nick to show what brilliant work he really does and when a local young man is shot and killed right on Dr. Charles' doorstep, the mystery is set in action.

There are lots of laughs as well. The train is outrageously crowded during wartime as nick and Nora find out: no private compartment this time. Nick is on the wagon drinking only apple cider, something hardly anyone believes, especially his father. Alcohol was highly rationed during the war for the making of industrial alcohol and liquor for the troops; though Nick and Nora's free-drinking ways had provided much of the humor of the earlier films, it probably would have gone down wrong for the wartime audience. There are especially funny moments when Nora jitterbugs with an athletic sailor as well as when she decides to follow a suspicious character around town herself. (In fact, the hotel with its handsome and very crowded ballroom and the mention of a local Burlesque theater makes me think Sycamore Springs is more of a small city than a small town). To their credit there's no humor base on the sophisticated Charles's  interactions with the locals making them look like rubes. The writers avoided such mean-spirited humor.

All and all it's one of the best and its very hard to guess the killer in this one.",1478908800,3,3433,4.642504118616145

400954,4,6301975960,"I liked the first two, the third not so much. This one, however, worked out fine, even if Nick drank nothing stronger than cider. (Though apple cider comes in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic versions.)

Nick brings Nora to Sycamore Springs, the rural town he grew up in, and visits his elderly father and mother. The father is a prominent local doctor who was disappointed that his son chose to become a policeman instead, though Nora responds by telling them what a wonderful detective Nick is-to Nick's embarrassment. Word spreads through town of Nick and Nora'a arrival, and the locals assume they are here to work on a criminal case. Of course, Nick and Nora only came for social reasons-until a man visits the father's house and is shot to death when the front door is answered. Now the pair have a crime to solve.

Unlike the previous installments, Asta is helpful this time, and Nick sticks to cider and no longer smokes. The movie was made at the tail end of World War Two, and of course the war effort is a large part of the mystery. And the suspects are more obvious than usual. At least not as convoluted as the third movie.",1465084800,,1135,4.5588235294117645

And if Willie Crump didn't wish to sell the painting by Peter Berton, why put it in the window??? Thankfully, Nora is given a bit more to do this time around. But the bit about who's tailing who goes on a little too long.
This Asta doesn't have quite the personality the original Asta had. But I've always wondered just where did they expect Asta to relieve himself? Right there in the aisle of the day coach?

Here Nick and Nora head out for Nick's hometown for a vacation and an innocent visit with his parents. However, the arrival of the famous detective sends ripples through the town that of course quickly embroil Nick in a murder mystery. Nora's attempt to help solve the case are largely ineffective, but very entertaining and amusing.

This is ""almost"" a fair mystery, in that there is a major behavioral clue that could lead you to identify the murderer.

These were among William Powell and Myrna Loy's best roles, in two long careers full of great roles.

Nora's character is especially eroded by the dialed-in script and perfunctory direction---for some reason, Nora is rendered dopey in this film, which derails the usually enchanting Nick-Nora chemistry. Powell and Loy carry the film as best they can, being the delightful comedic virtuosos they were.

401324,4,6301975960,"This 5th in the ""Thin Man"" series, acquires a new director in Richard Thorpe, in part I suspect because of war time obligations and perhaps to mix things up a bit.  The series had become predictable and in the grand scheme of things, this film is no different.

The setting has moved from the big city hubbub to the more tranquil hometown of Nick Charles (William Powell), Sycamore Springs.  Nick doesn't visit often, but his birthday is coming up.  His father (Harry Davenport), a medical doctor, has always been disappointed that Nick didn't follow in his footsteps and instead, became ""a policeman.""  A natty Nora (Myrna Loy) and Nick board the train to Sycamore Springs along with Asta, their dog, but are relegated to the baggage car because their smuggled pet was discovered.  Part of the charm of the ""Thin Man"" franchise has been the wealthy Charles's being able to identify with the common folk, so riding in the baggage car, is made light of.  Young Nickie, their young son is left at home thankfully.

What is different in this film is the absence of booze.  Hard to believe but Nick and Nora are on the wagon.  Partially because Nick's parents are teetotalers and perhaps because of the shortage caused by WW II.  This film will also more prominently feature Nora.  Her usual comedic foil for Nick remains as sharp as ever, but her scenes are longer and more upfront.

In what is expected to be a restful week in the bucolic town turns into murder when a young man is shot at the doorstep of Dr. and Mrs. Charles (Lucile Watson).  This leads to an investigation by the local police chief (Donald MacBride).  When it stalls, Nick is called into action.  A mixture of new faces in town and old friends of Nick's provide the usual cadre of suspects.  Nick's knowledge of anatomy and the use of medical equipment to solve the case earn Nick the pat on the back from his father that he had always longed for.  The series had become a bit tired while still entertaining.  This edition pumps a bit of new life back in.",1407024000,,2023,4.569444444444445

It's a nice change to have no swearing, no graphic violence, and black-and-white images that aren't stark and disconcerting.

401332,4,6301975960,"The Thin Man Goes Home is one hour and forty minutes and was released in theaters on January 25, 1945. Nick and Nora are going to Nick's parents in Sycamore Springs for some peace, quiet and rest. At first the trip is going fine with the well intended rest and then one night after dinner a mysterious person arrives only to be shot seconds later. Nora believes this is a good time for Nick to impress his father. Nora rambles off a bunch of past cases to Dr. Bertram Charles (Nick's father); actually they are the cases of the past four Thin Man movies. Before you know it Nick is involved with the case. The highlight of this movie is when Nora is dancing with a sailor and I think those two were dancing the Jitter Bug; please correct me if I am wrong. When Nora heads up the stairs and down the hallway, she is dizzy from the dance. Missing from this movie is the alcohol. Nick is drinking only apple cider in this film, mainly to impress his dad. Edward Brophy, who was in the original Thin Man movie as a bad guy returns as the good guy. The Thin Man Goes Home is a much improvement over Shadow of the Thin Man with a better plot and a few more laughs. The Thin Man Goes Home gets a B+.

401333,3,6301975960,"The sophisticated Charleses go to funky Sycamore Springs, the town where Nick grew up. Frankly, I like him better in a big city setting. But anyway.

He thinks he's just come for a vacation and to visit his parents, but everyone assumes he's working on a case. He's a famous detective, after all. But he's resisting the implications pretty successfully until a young artist falls dead at his doorstep. And of course there are plenty of suspects, perhaps one could say the entire town. Everyone is acting suspicious for one reason or another, although most of that has nothing to do with the murder.

But just as Nick is apparently getting a handle on the first murder, Crazy Mary is found dead in her reclusive cabin with its ""Keep Out"" sign on the door. Oddly enough, this second murder provides Nick with a vital clue to the first one.

Good movie, but not as good as the earlier ones.",1336694400,,887,4.566037735849057

Nora: ""I sort of like the old one"".
Nick: ""Why, darling, that's the nicest thing you've said to me since the time I got my head caught in that cuspidor at the Waldorf"".

The fifth entry in the popular ""Thin Man"" franchise, THE THIN MAN GOES HOME (1945) was the first one without longtime director W.S. ""One-Take"" Van Dyke (who had since passed away), but still manages to create lots of magic thanks to the pairing of William Powell and Myrna Loy, back as our favourite high society sleuths Nick and Nora Charles.

In THE THIN MAN GOES HOME, Nick's on the wagon--much to Nora's dismay--and eager to revisit his childhood haunts in the cozy hamlet of Sycamore Springs.  Of course, murders and criminal activitity don't exist in such a place...or do they?  When Peter Berton (Ralph Brooks) is shot on the Charles' porch, the suspects include a dramatic heiress (Gloria DeHaven), vagrant bag-lady ""Crazy Mary"" (Anne Revere), and a nervy antique shop owner (Donald Meek).

Lucile Watson and Harry Davenport co-star as Nick's parents.  The screenplay by Robert Riskin and Harry Kurnitz is tight and snappy, and very reminiscent of the earlier Goodrich/Hackett ""Thin Man"" efforts.  One of the better titles.",1259971200,,1264,4.824074074074074
401349,3,6301975960,"Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy) are off to visit Nick's parents (played by Harry Davenport and Lucile Watson) in Sycamore Springs.  Along for the trip is Asta the dog, but they left little Nicky behind since he was enjoying kindergarten so much (like that excuse would fly with any grandparent).

Nick is well known in his hometown, and everyone immediately assumes he is there to work on a case.  Nora encourages those rumors if only to bring out the skeletons so Nick can impress his father, who still wishes Nick had become a doctor.

All too soon, a young artist drops dead on the doorstep of the Charles home.  Now Nick and Nora have a real mystery to solve.  Can Nick do it?

Having enjoyed the previous four films in the series, I must say I was disappointed with this one.  Oh, don't get me wrong, the acting is still fine.  But the script let everyone down.

First off, I truly missed the humor.  Actually, I did find the scenes about Nick's drinking (he's on the wagon here) pretty funny.  But the wit has been replaced with slapstick.  Yes, those scenes are funny, but they don't compare to the humor of the previous films.

Then there's the mystery.  While I have trouble with old time actors, if I concentrate, I can follow the story and keep people straight.  Here, that never happened.  There were a few events and revelations early, but it was still underdeveloped.  Having said that, the solution was logical.

This is the weakest of the first five in the series (I'll reserve judgment on the entire series until I've seen the sixth).  Fans will certainly enjoy it, but it pales next to the others.",1248998400,4,1636,4.556701030927835
401350,4,6301975960,"This is a very pleasant entry into ""The Thin Man"" series. I found it much less aggravating than the other stories simply because of the drinking and smoking factor, which was always overdone in this series despite the great writing and acting talents of the two leads, William Powell and Myrna Low.

Unbelievably, Powell and Loy don't have a drop of alcohol to drink in the entire film.  In this film it's just ""Nick"" and ""Nora"" solving a crime on their own and then - in Charlie Chan-type style - rounding up all the suspects in one room and exposing the criminal while explaining the case.

401352,3,6301975960,"I am a  devotee of the detective writer Dashiel Hammett. I believe that Nick and Nora Charles in the original Thin Man represented interesting transitional figures from the old amateur drawing room detectives to the modern hard-boiled detectives but enough is enough. As in current blockbuster films the desire to milk an original idea beyond its point of saturation is clear in this the fifth in the series. Oh, yes Nick and Nora are in love. Asta is, well Asta is Asta. Beyond that Nick's return home to solve a murder and make papa proud, all without alcohol, should have send everyone  scurrying back to New York City or San Francisco on the next train-make that the next plane.",1187740800,,682,4.722689075630252
401353,5,6301975960,"Nick and Nora are off to Nick's parents in Sycamore Springs in this fun outing for our favorite mystery duo. Nick has taken to apple cider in anticipation of his birthday visit hoping for a pat on the back from his disapproving dad, who wanted Nick to follow in his footsteps and become a doctor.

A good screenplay from Frank Capra's favorite writer, Robert Riskin, in collaboration with Dwight Taylor, has the couple becoming involved in another crime while being a bit more domestic visiting the folks. Everett Riskin produced this fun MGM entry in the series, directed nicely by Richard Thorpe this time. While it doesn't have the frantic snap of some of the other entries, the charm and witty byplay between the screen's most fun couple remains to make this one very enjoyable.

The mystery involves a painting of an old windmill Nora buys as a birthday gift for Nicky, much to her chagrin. It will turn out, however, to Nora's delight, to be the key to two murders that will force Nick into action and show his dad (Harry Davenport) just why he should be proud. There is the usual detective work from Nick and, of course, the suspects all gathered together as the murderer is exposed. But it is the fun getting there which makes ""The Thin Man Goes Home"" so much fun for fans.

Nora has some fine moments telling Nick's dad and mom (Lucile Watson) about Nick's capture of ""Stinky"" in an effort to impress them. It's also great fun as Nick rests in a hammock wearing his old high school uniform and reading detective magazines while Nora fruitlessly attempts to set up a lawn chair. The most fun, however, occurs when a solo Nora, tracking down a suspect, starts a brawl in a pool hall.

There is a solid supporting cast as always, led by Gloria DeHaven as the dramatic young Laura Belle Ronson. Donald Meek, Leon Ames, Anne Revere as ""Crazy Mary,"" and lovely Helen Vinson round out the fine cast. It is nice to see Vinson, especially, as film buffs will remember her tender role in ""I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang.""

Will Nick finally get that pat on the back from the old man and pop a button on his vest? You don't want to miss Nora getting a spanking from Nick while you find out. William Powell and Myrna Loy will forever hold a special place in the heart of every film buff for these wonderful films so full of entertainment. Don't miss Nora's wild dance with a sailor as Nick tries to ditch her in this one. That alone is worth the price of admission.",1180051200,3,2465,4.481069042316259

401385,5,6301975960,"10 years later, Nick and Nora Charles (and Asta) are back for a delightful fifth installment in the Thin Man series. This time, on Nick's birthday, the Charles are visiting Nick's parents in the rural, small town of Sycamore Springs. But all is not well between Nick and his dad, Dr. Bertram Charles (Harry Davenport). Nora is distressed to find out that Dr. Charles patronizingly looks down at Nick's ""policeman"" profession, and she asks Mrs. Charles if there are any cases lying about which Nick could solve to impress his father. If he could just make his father proud once, Nick'll pop a vest button. Well, no sooner asked than granted. One evening, a man is murdered at the Charles' front door and Nick and Nora find themselves suddenly embroiled in another humdinger of a murder mystery. Yes, this is a bit of a departure from the usual cosmopolitan settings in which we routinely see the Charles. However, it doesn't take long for Nick to start feeling right at home again as he strives to crack the case, despite the number of corpses piling up. En route, he unearths several small town secrets and uncovers a murderer and a spy ring. But is it enough to make a father proud?

True, Nick and Nora Charles, formerly the lives-of-the-cocktail-party, may have settled down a bit (after all, they have a brat now), and Nick now imbibes cider rather than martinis. But, even after all this time, Powell and Loy's dazzling chemistry is still very much intact. As usual, the murder mystery is secondary to the charming play between Nick and Nora. In fact, the mystery isn't even introduced until  30 minutes into the picture, as director Richard Thorpe first has the film leisurely wallow in an amusing train escapade, several introductions of quirky character actors, Nora's virtuoso breakdown of the case of Stinky Davis, and Nora's epic cage match with a lawn chair.

But even with the advent of the mystery element, the film still takes time to indulge in Nick and Nora frolickings. There's a little scene with Nick and Nora and her frustrated attempts to introduce his birthday present, a painting of a windmill from Nick's childhood. There's Nora's amateurish shadowing of a ""suspect,"" with Nora, in turn, being followed, which all climaxes in a pool room brawl. And what about Nick foisting off his wife onto a partnerless sailor who longs to dance at a charity event? Jitterbug, anyone?

I get a kick out of how Nick Charles's urbane sophistication seems to strand him in the face of his father's low expectations. Dr. Charles never got over the disappointment of Nick not following him in the doctoring biz. A nice touch early on, which whets the viewer's appetite, is the scene of Nick ineptly fixing an endtable, only to have it fall apart and bushwhack him, leaving him prone on the carpet, which is exactly where his father finds him. Nick has to insist that Dr. Charles take a sip of his cider drink to convince him he isn't inebriated.

The dialogue as usual is smart and snappy; the plot is convoluted but is ably enlivened by two leads in full rapport with each other. The character actors, a great staple of the series, once again sparkle and divert. Lucile Watson as Mrs. Charles, Harry Davenport as Dr. Charles, Donald Meek as the pawnshop owner Mr. Crump, Gloria DeHaven as the overly dramatic Laura Ronson, Anne Revere as Crazy Mary, and Anita Sharp-Bolster as the suspicious Charles' housekeeper all do very credible work. The Thin Man Goes Home may not have the fresh and seminal quality of the first Thin Man, but at this point, any Thin Man installment is like comfort food or hot cocoa, brimming with warmth and nostalgia. This fifth offering is actually my second favorite of the series, after The Thin Man, and mostly because of the family dynamics brought in. The underlying theme of the film is Nick trying to make his father proud of him, and I'm on board with that.

I'm not one for suggesting that people spend their money frivolously, but the Thin Man series is that rare case where every film is worth its weight in gold. So my recommendation for folks thinking of purchasing a Thin Man movie: just go ahead and buy the entire box set collection. Trust me, if you own one Thin Man, you'll want to own the rest.",1154304000,12,4247,4.701612903225806
401386,4,6301975960,"""The Thin Man Goes Home"" (1945) was the 5th movie in the ""Thin Man"" franchise and the first directed by Richard Thorpe, from a screenplay by newcomers Robert Riskin and Dwight Taylor. ""The Thin Man Goes Home"" is a convoluted murder mystery with a long list of diverse suspects, as usual, but it is otherwise a departure from the previous ""Thin Man"" movies. It isn't set in an urban environment, but in an idyllic small-town America that anticipates the Eisenhower era with its apparent purity. There are sordid dramas among regular folk, but criminal underworld characters are absent. And Nick and Nora Charles no longer lead glamorous, exciting lives. They seem dowdy, in fact. It's as if hard-boiled fiction met ""Leave It To Beaver"" -a decade too early. I can only guess that the reason for the change was Hollywood's desire to present an idealized vision of middle class Americans during World War II. Nick is even on the wagon, drinking apple cider from his flask! It's ironic, since movies were getting markedly less sentimental and more hard-boiled in the 1940s, while the ""Thin Man"" series is becoming more domestic. Go figure.

""The Thin Man Goes Home"" finds Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy) visiting Nick's family in the town where he grew up. While Nick has his heart set on rest and relaxation, Nora hopes that a mystery will turn up for him to solve, so that Nick will have the opportunity to prove himself to his disappointed father (Harry Davenport), who wanted Nick to be a doctor like himself. As if on queue, a stranger collapses dead on their doorstep. So Nick goes about looking for clues, stirring things up in the tranquil town of Sycamore Springs -where people don't like things stirred up.

I didn't like ""The Thin Man Goes Home"" at first. There is no glamour and no gangsters. The Charleses are a comfortable middle-aged couple -or rather Nick is comfortable in his sweatshirt and Nora looks like an absurd decoration. Poor Myrna Loy wins my Worst Wardrobe Award for her frizzy hairdo, horrible house dresses, and the ugliest suits imaginable. But ""The Thin Man Goes Home"" is not a bad mystery; it's simply dated. It's WWII propaganda, insomuch as a comedic murder mystery could be. Nick and Nora Charles have left the high life behind to become Everyman and Everywoman, even traveling in coach on the train, which seems inexplicable given their wealth. Nick uncovers international espionage, not just murder for passion or money. ""The Thin Man Goes Home"" is a film for a certain time and place. It doesn't really hold up today, but that, in itself,  is interesting on some level. And the mystery is reasonably well-written, which is more than I would expect from the 5th film in a 6-film series.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): ""Why Daddy?"" (9 min) is a comedic short film written by and starring Robert Benchley. He plays Joe, a man who goes on a radio quiz show to match wits with a child contestant. ""Screwball Squirrel"" (7 min) is a cartoon in which a smart aleck fox torments a dopey bird dog. The gimmick is that the animals know that they're performing in a movie. There is also a theatrical trailer for ""The Thin Man Goes Home"". Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, and French.",1143417600,,3239,4.758007117437723
401387,4,6301975960,"In the 5th installment of the Thin Man series, Nick and Nora decide to visit Nick's parents in the small town of Sycamore Springs.  During the train ride there, they smuggle Asta aboard in Nora's fur coat but leave little Nicky Jr. at home!

Nick's father (Harry Davenport) is a well-respected Doctor who is trying to get a new hospital built.  He never liked Nick becoming a detective and always looked down on his son because of his career choice and lifestyle.  Naturally, the first time they meet...Nick is lying on the floor after bumping his head on a table, but dad thinks he's drunk again.

Of course, everyone in town knows Nick Charles and they all think he's there on a case.  Soon he is, as a series of murders takes place as well as a phony painting con and of course Nick has to step in and solve the murders.  In the end his dad finally says how proud he is of Nick.

Still the humor is quite sharp.  At one point Nick Gives Nora a spanking since she shot her mouth off to the newspapers about Nicks involvement in the case.  Very funny there and his dad takes glee in Nora getting smacked on the behind.

The movie still has some of its great character actors such as Edward Brophy (who appeared in the first Thin Man film as a gangster) as Brogan...a con man friend of Nicks, and Donald Meek as art store owner Willie Crump.  Also look for a young Gloria DeHaven as a teenager smitten with Nick.

Not the best of the series but not the worst either.  Still a great deal of fun.",1102464000,7,1494,4.289285714285715
401388,4,6301975960,"This is the fourth sequel to the 1934 smash hit THE THIN MAN. Just when I would have thought the series was dead the producers and writers were able to add life to the franchise.
Nick goes home and of course gets dragged into another murder mystery. Nora, who by now should no longer be curious to see Nick solve a mystery, tries to get Nick to solve a murder mystery so he can impress his father the medical doctor. Nick's father had always hoped his son would have become a doctor and when Nick became a cop and then detective he looked down on him. As far as the mystery goes it follows the typical THIN MAN formula. A bunch of suspects are introduced and in the end Nick rounds them all up and reveals the killer.
The comedy is better than ever. Rather than have Nick always drinking and having jokes centered around his drinking Nick is now sober. The jokes are even funnier because everyone believes he is still a drunk and he just can't convince them otherwise. The scene in his Dad's parlor is hilarious. Nick is stone sober but due to a series of mishaps he is on the floor and appears to all to be drunk as ever. Also, when Nick recounts his childhood to Nora and tells her of his trips to the wood shed that brings back memories of my childhood and trips to the wood shed.
This is my second favorite THIN MAN movie. Right behind AFTER THE THIN MAN and just before the original THIN MAN. It is an almost perfect blend of mystery and comedy. Where the heck are the DVD's for all the THIN MAN movies?",1083196800,7,1508,4.239583333333333

There's an extra dose of humour in this story compared to the others in the series and the film has a strong supporting cast that includes Lucile Watson and Harry Davenport as the parents, Gloria DeHaven as a drama queen, Leon Ames as a mysterious art collector, and best of all, Anne Revere as the town's crazy woman.  William Powell and Myrna Loy do their customary good job as the leads.

401390,4,6301975960,"This entry in the series is a change of pace.  Instead of New York or San Francisco we have Sycamore Springs.  Sycamore Springs looks as if it is just down the road from George Bailey's Bedford Falls.  It's very Norman Rockwell.  Lots of trees, picket fences, and big houses.  Nick and Nora breeze into town to celebrate Nick's birthday with the folks.  There are a variety of suspicious characters hanging around town.  They get nervous when a famous detective arrives.  There is, in fact, a murder.  Right on the Charles' front porch.  Nick and Nora's razor sharp repartee lost some of its edginess by this point in the series.  This film gets disparaged as a step down in quality.  Although some of the banter takes place over a wobbly piece of lawn furniture in the side yard rather than a cocktail shaker in a New York bar, dismissing the film as inferior is a mistake.  Ozzie and Harriet interludes notwithstanding, this is fun for those who enjoy classic comedy.  A hallmark of the series is that the murder is an excuse for humor.  Not to make fun of murder, of course, but it's hilarious when Nora follows a suspect on a walk on the wild side.  The WWII flavor of this flick adds to its old-fashioned charm.  The mystery is of stolen propellor plans down at the local defense plant.  The small town social mores are quaint.

It's almost impossible for there's always something special about each one that tugs at your heart! So it is with The Thin Man Goes Home...as equally charming on it's own merit as all the others in this series. It's quite a slower pace than we're accustomed to, but then Nick and Nora do manage to get involved in a murder even when going back home to visit Nick's parents. Thankfully the plot involved here is at least understandable, while I was never able to follow Nick's reasoning in solving his other storylines! It's a great tribute to the charismatic personalities of William Powell and Mryna Loy that they continually hypnotized the audience into overlooking the screwy plots written for them. My only criticism is that Nick openly spanks Nora in front of his parents! It seemed a bit chauvinistic of Nick's character to exhibit such behavior and unlike Nora's strong independent nature to allow him to humiliate her in that respect.

Will Drake talk? They show a Japanese Nambu sniper rifle with a silencer. Theres a surprise that reveals the murderer! That was wonderful says Nicks father.

A popular movie often results in sequels until customer interest decreases. This was the last of the Thin Man sequels. I think it is about average as stories go, you can compare it to earlier movies.
