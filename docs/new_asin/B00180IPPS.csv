3176435,4,B00180IPPS,"Ian Rankin's 'Rebus' police/procedural series, a series that takes place in Edinburgh, was my favorite mystery novel. I read each one,savoring the cases and the man,Rebus. How could a television series replicate this man? Well, it can't, but it comes darn close.

I have always pictured, DI, Detective Inspector, Rebus as a rumble tumble guy, smokes and  drinks too much. Grey haired, clothes a mess but clean, sort of.  Ken Stott fits the bill, though  I pictured Rebus a little taller. Too much of a ladies man is this Rebus, but, other than that, pretty close.  DS, Detective Sargeant, Siohban Clarke, played by Claire Price, is exactly right. Slim, intelligent, thoughtful, pretty, and independent.  Detective Chief Superintendent, Gill Templar, played by Jennifer Black is superb. Just the right amount of bossiness and attractive, to boot. These are the three that appear in each of the episodes. The hair styles may change with Siohban andbTemplar, but Rebus remains, Rebus, always the same.

The cases are taken from Ian Rankin's books, but there the similarity changes. Not much is the same, and the storyline is either changed or exemplified for television. However, they are engrossing, and though many try to take Rebus down, no one succeeds .
The scenes of Glasgow are much like I pictured, and they bring the storyline much to the fore.

There are two different Rebus, one is younger and not to my liking. I much prefer the older version in Ken Stott. This is a more realistic, hard edged,and hard nosed Rebus. Some morals left, but his real job is to solve the crime,  and if you get away, he promises to find you.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-04-12

3176441,5,B00180IPPS,"""Rebus Set 3,"" as seen on BBC America, is newly-released.  It was made by Britain's Independent Television (ITV), although it's being seen on the BBC channel on these shores.  Like the others in this superb series, it's a police procedural excellently filmed in Edinburgh, though not the bits of it with which tourists are familiar. Furthermore, scenes, whether on the streets or in the police station, are crowded with people and cars, of correct-looking vintage, rushing around.  The people have also apparently been encouraged to speak in the local dialect, which adds immeasurably to the engrossing ""foreign"" flavor of these productions; although the dialog might be impenetrable to those of us on these shores without the unadvertised subtitles thoughtfully provided by Acorn. The series is, of course, based on the Inspector Rebus novels, also set in Edinburgh, written by prize-winning, best selling Scottish author Ian Rankin.  He's tipped by such of his colleagues as best-selling American crime novelist James Ellroy, as the progenitor and #1 practitioner of ""tartan noir,""the Scottish adaptation of noir fiction: bloodier and more bloody-minded than the usual, boasting that scorching Scottish humor.

This series features four more taut offerings from the hit British series of crime thrillers, including ""Resurrection Men,"" based on the Edgar-Award for Best Novel-winning book of the same name; and ""The Naming of the Dead,"" based on the book of the same name that won the British Book Award for Crime Thriller of the Year.  Also""Knots and Crosses,"" based on an earlier book, the first Rebus novel, published in 1987 to great critical acclaim. And ""The First Stone,"" apparently an original screenplay using Rankin's characters.

These characters continue to be played by the excellent cast assembled for post-John Hannah productions: admired television actor Ken Stott, man of a thousand faces, in the title role, that of Detective Inspector Rebus. Claire Price as his earnest, ambitious partner Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke. And Jennifer Black as Detective Chief Superintendent Gillian Templer, Rebus's boss, and one of his many former lovers.  Black's character appears to have beefed-up parts in this series -- and good for her -- though it looks to me as if she and Price are having trouble with the wardrobe department: the ones they've been given are dowdy, and quite meager. It's a good thing they're not making ""Sex and the City.""

""Resurrection Men"" has been just about totally rewritten from the book; that's probably just as well; as many people complained the latter was confusing.  ""The First Stone,"" an original script, is a riveting, gutsy attack on the Church of Scotland.  ""The Naming of the Dead"" has also been largely rewritten from the book; also, undoubtedly, just as well, as many readers complained about that book,too.  Finally,"" Knots and Crosses"" is excellently done.  It features actor Nicholas Farrell, who's virtually grown-up on TV and movie screens before us, as its villain.

In ""The First Stone,"" when Templer is asked how she sleeps at night, with the things she's been forced to see as a cop, she answers, ""a wee dram."" If you're watching this exciting series at night, you just might need similar help.",1213920000,8,3256,5.212643678160919

8268046,5,B00180IPPS,"DI John Rebus the most famous fictional Scottish detective. The books written by Ian Rankin have been turned into a series. Ken Stott is the star of this series. Rebus is for the underdog, and he will break rules, forget what his superiors ask and do what is right in his eyes,

Ahhhh, Rebus and his good friend, DS Siobhan Clarke, work well together. She is the only one who really understands him. However, as time does not stand still, Ian Rankin's new character DI Malcom Fox, heading The Ethics and Standards Division' makes his appearance,and he is shocked, shocked,,I tell you, to find Rebus back on the force. He dredges up all the old complaints, none of which went anywhere when Rebus was on the force. The cat and mouse game continues. I actually resented Fox in this novel, at first...

We get to meet Rebus's daughter as he travels to the north of Scotland on this case. He is trying to resurrect their relationship. We also see a great deal of Scotland, the north country and get to meet the people. This is a time when Scotland is attempting to exert it's independence, and we see the issues from all sides. This is a fascinating study of a man who was let out to pasture, trying to regain his foothold. Rebus has not changed much, his habits remain the same, but I do detect a little empathy in the man. He is trying to deal with the changes in the workplace and the computerization of his workplace.

Rebus is the man who loves the music, the whiskey, the man who pays little attention to the niceties of life. There are some tell tale signs that Rebus might be working with his unit again.. He is also privy to every bad duck in Scotland, and can often get them to help him in some cases.

8268050,3,B00180IPPS,"I like this series. Lost a star for not having subtitles. I'm a bit hard of hearing but mostly need them for some hard-to-get accents. Still, easier than the John Hannah series. I haven't read the novels recently enough to say how they compare with the programs, but worth watching in themselves.

This series shows how the job affects the people who are doing this honorable job and the toll it takes on their lives.  It is also encouraging to think that dedication to saving people from themselves without perpetrating more violence is a possibility and the struggle to train and mentor another generation of right-thinking individuals is worth the effort.  Ken Stott  and cast are masterful at drawing us into the psyche of these characters created by Ian Rankin.
