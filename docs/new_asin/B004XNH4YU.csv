4496589,5,B004XNH4YU,I love the Rifftrax Live dvds because they have all of the extra shorts too!  Reefer Madness is hilarious with the riffs.,1359590400,,121,4.5
4496590,3,B004XNH4YU,"I own all the regular Rifftrax DVDs, including the black and white version of this one.

Previous to this DVD purchase, I had bought the live version of ""House on Haunted Hill"" and was pleasantly surprised to find out that over half of the riffing was brand new, and extremely funny.

This live version of Reefer Madness, however, has VERY LITTLE new riffs.  Probably a good 90% is word for word the same as the earlier DVD.  That said, it is still funny, and you get three excellent shorts (my wife and I laughed super hard at the short about grass) so if you don't have any version of Reefer Madness, its a good time.

If you DO have the earlier DVD, however, be aware that most of the movie will sound exaclty the same with the only new content being the three shorts.

I didn't pay much for my copy, so I wasn't too disappointed, but had I known it'd be exactly the same jokes, I probably wouldn't have bought it at all, and just watched the shorts on hulu.",1353628800,,961,4.281767955801105
4496591,5,B004XNH4YU,"From San Diego in 2009, Mike, Bill and Kevin bring their great brand of humor and riffing to a live audience with 3 shorts and the 1930's anti-drug film ""Reefer Madness"", also included are a couple of minute long shorts from SomethingAwful.com which I guess are by a friend of theirs but they aren't anything memorable.

First up ""More Dangerous Than Dynamite""-A 1930's film that shows the dangers of washing your clothes in pans of gasoline and also how it can be used properly as a cleaning solvent. The guys are in rare form here as the material is so goofy it bears watching more than once even if you can't believe a frame of it.

""At Your Fingertips""-""What's more boring than watching grass grow? Watching grass not grow"" that one line by Mike sums up this odd and disturbing craft based grass film where a narrator talks about what you can do with grass as a crafting tool, which isn't much. Funny stuff here as this material is very bad and just goofy beyond words.

""Frozen Frolics""-A couple of dog like creatures are on a sled being pulled by the same creatures, then they gets stranded and must make it to the north poll. Its a 1930's cartoon that is the right type of short for the guys and they get some good lines in especially Kevin who references current Philly QB Michael Vick at one point.

The main feature is Reefer Madness, which shows how young people can go crazy and commit murder should they succumb to the madness of reefer. Its very badly acted, poorly paced, the premise of the film is totally off base given how the drug itself wouldn't cause this behavior. However all this doesn't stop the guys from ripping it apart and having a ball with all the films problems. My favorite line comes from Mike, during the trial scene where he says: ""Objection, my attorney died 20 minutes ago.""

The live audience does lend a unique feeling and there a couple of expected flubbed lines as can happen with any live performance. But the guys are on top of their game here and this is a great dvd to have in your Rifftrax collection.",1329436800,,2048,4.494623655913978
4496592,3,B004XNH4YU,"The blu-ray colorization makes me a little ill because the film itself is already a little jumpy. The over-saturated colors makes it over the top. I also did not like how they would add the three riffer's to the side of the picture every now and then. I am watching on a 40"" Sony XBR2 from about 10 feet away.

The original DVD, not the ""live"" trax, is better because the film is in black and white like it's suppose to be. And the DVD has the option to watch the film only without the rifftrax. This blu-ray release has ONLY the COLOR Restoration, AND you get interrupted by a Brady Bunch panel on the side of the video at various times, AND you cannot view the feature without the rifftrax.

The blu-ray does not contain the original black and white version, AND you have to watch it with the screen changing aspect ratio every time the three riffer's show up.",1317945600,6,862,4.3478260869565215
4496593,4,B004XNH4YU,"This Blu Ray and Live version is better than the original with new shorts added and their riffs crystal clear.  While not the gang's best effort, it is nonetheless a necessary addition to your Rifftrax/MST3K library.",1316736000,,216,5.0
4496594,4,B004XNH4YU,"As the post-MST3K world goes, Rifftrax has just been too hit-or-miss for me.  I've picked up a few titles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnival-of-Souls/dp/B0026KJP6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnival of Souls</a>&nbsp;is one of my favorite B movies so I HAD to have that one).  But seeing they put their live shows out on Blu-ray perked my interest enough to order this.  Good thing too, because this has ended up being my favorite of the Rifftrax outings.  The best part of the show isn't the feature film...it's the short about grass (as in lawn), which is funny enough without the riffing.

I found the visual presentation to be a bit annoying.  The image keeps alternating between the movie itself centered on the screen and the movie off to the left to fit images of the three riffers to the right in Brady windows.  I found that to be distracting and unnecessary.

Still, the subject matter is ripe for riffing, and the laughs are frequent.",1313971200,3,991,5.267515923566879
4496595,5,B004XNH4YU,"I saw this show in the theater last year and couldn't wait to get it on DVD. The shorts alone make it worth buying, but then the jokes during the movie were certainly worthwhile as well. The jokes are not simply a repeat of the studio version of Rifftrax Reefer Madness and while I enjoy that DVD quite a bit the live version is just as good or better with lots of new jokes added. As others have pointed out, there are a few flubbed lines, but they are few and far between and it is LIVE comedy, so that is to be expected. If anything, it adds to the humor. The energy of the live performance and connection with the theater audience more than makes up for a few verbal stumbles. I highly recommend this DVD, it is one of my favorites of the Rifftrax Live series so far.

Shorts include:
- More Dangerous Than Dynamite: A 1930's short about the hazards of washing your laundry at home in gasoline. D'uh!
- At Your Fingertips: Grasses: A bizarre arts and crafts short for children from the 1970's. You'll wonder what the makers of this one were thinking when they dreamed it up.
- Frozen Frolics: An odd 1930 cartoon that is not so classic, but it is a bit bizarre. Let's just say it's no Steamboat Willy.

There's also a new introduction on the DVD featuring Mike, Kevin and Bill.

The shorts are so amusingly odd that they kind of make fun of themselves, but Rifftrax certainly does add jokes worth hearing. If you're a MSTie and or a Rifftrax fan you won't want to miss this one. Recommended.",1307491200,4,1495,4.332142857142857
4496596,5,B004XNH4YU,"A 1930s movie about (sic) the ""Dangers Of Marijuana?""  Be a little real, marijuana is about as ""dangerous"" as Shirley Temple or Tiny Tim.  The ONLY ""true"" way to achieve any sort of ""edification"" ref ""Reefer Madness"" is to allow the Riff Trax guys, Mike, Kevin, and Bill, to explain the...""subtile nuances"" of this FINE film to you.  And the song they've composed which is available between the Riff Trax-enhanced version of (giggle) ""Reefer Madness"" and the original (yes, they both occupy the same DVD!) film is worth the price of admission, just by itself.  MST3K may have gone to that great resting place in the sky where ""Fridays,"" ""Alf,"" ""the Monkees,"" and ""Car 54 Where Are You"" now abide, but the Riff Trax guys do very well, keeping its spirit alive and quite well.",1306454400,3,774,4.711111111111111

4496599,4,B004XNH4YU,The Rifftrax boys take on a classic public domain crapper in color as well as a trio of shorts. It makes me miss the old Mystery Science Theater.  Definitely one of the better Rifftrax.,1399075200,,185,4.4411764705882355
4496600,3,B004XNH4YU,I bought this as I love MST and the same people are involved in both. With the guys sitting on the side of a stage next to the movie screen and making jokes just didn't do it for me. I will not buy  any more of these.,1398729600,,217,3.617021276595745

4496602,5,B004XNH4YU,"The Rifftrax guys in and of themselves have a cult following, but to have them riffing on Reefer Madness created a brand new cult DVD that will have you in hysterics the entire time! Great in Blu Ray--but the shorts are an extra added treat that makes the DVD well worth the purchase--A well deserved 5 star rating!",1395446400,,315,4.448275862068965
4496603,5,B004XNH4YU,"I laughed through the whole thing. The short films before the movie are funny, too, especially the one about ""grasses."" It's a strange arts-and-crafts film. I even like the silly song, ""Reefer Boy."" Of course, the worst possible consequences of smoking pot happen to the people in this movie.",1391990400,,292,4.979591836734694

4496605,5,B004XNH4YU,This may be the best of the live shows IMHO. The shorts nearly stole the show. I'm going to start washing my clothes in gasoline.,1377302400,,129,4.2
4496606,5,B004XNH4YU,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 is something new to me.  But it is fun.  It is a movie, a bad one with a couple of guys riffing it.  If you do not know what that is, well you know how when you watch a bad movie with your friends and you make fun of it through out the movie... well there you go.  That is what a riff is.  They say funny things about the mistakes in the movie, and bad acting and whatever else they find that is funny.",1362182400,,431,3.797752808988764

8447269,5,B004XNH4YU,"Somehow I'd managed to miss ""Reefer Madness"" on the midnight movie circuit, but now I can see the appeal of this movie: it's one of the greatest unintentional comedies ever made. It's absolutely impossible to watch it without laughing.

A wizened prune of a man lectures anyone within earshot about the evils of marijuana, and illustrates his point by recounting the story of a high school dweeb who smokes one joint, and is immediately plunged into a world of addiction, madness, murder and suicide. This is a colorized version -- as if watching this turkey in the original black & white would be any improvement -- and Mike, Bill, and Kevin rip this movie a new one, hilarious even when they flub the occasional line.

The shorts preceding the feature are awesomely bizarre. Animator Rich Kyanka provides two surrealistic films written and narrated by his five-year-old daughter, which are even stranger than the plotless 1930 cartoon, ""Frozen Frolics.""",1422230400,,955,5.037974683544304
