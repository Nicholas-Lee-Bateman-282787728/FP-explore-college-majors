At the time it seemed like an exaggeration but now that I have watched this movie I am more convinced of how putrid and corrupt the Mexican political and justice system is.

The sad part of this, is that most of the Colosio movie is based on hard actual data, that the person that killed Luis Donaldo Colosio is not the same one that is in jail (or was, I think he already has been killed), and that the big Mexican entrepreneurs, industry leaders and public figures of Economics, Media and Politics were involved.

I suppose that the best simile to this story was the assassination of JFK where the assassin was conveniently killed before he could be interrogated and he used ""magic"" trajectory-changing bullets as well.

I would recommend this movie to my friends and I would buy it again. Very entertaining, excellent actors, credible easy to follow story/script that leaves you wanting to see and know more about it. Great detective/conspiracy/mystery like movie.",1419379200,5,1268,4.780821917808219
8545950,5,B00A142R1A,"This is a fantastic movie.

Let's start with two of the actors: Jose Maria Yazpik and Kate Castillo.
They both do a fantastic job becoming their characters.

This is a true story, and very exciting and moving. I was completely unaware of the history behind this story.  It feels like you are watching a work of fiction,  but you are not.  The movie doesn't talk down to the audience: it just tells a compelling story in a terrific fashion, with great acting, writing and directing.  It is well worth buying.  You will want your friends to buy it so you can talk about it with them!",1399593600,,581,4.4245283018867925
