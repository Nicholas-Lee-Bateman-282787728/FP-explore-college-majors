6097682,2,B00GOYHT1E,Color problems with the DVD copy received here.  Distracting to view with wavy lines of color throughout the viewing.  Poor quality of color.,1404777600,3,141,5.086956521739131
6097683,5,B00GOYHT1E,Mary Magdalena was tormented with guilt when she met Jesus but his act of kindness and forgiveness lifted her up from the pit of despair. I don't usually get emotional even watching very good movies or reading heart touching stories but this one brought tears to my eyes.,1399507200,11,271,4.666666666666667
6097684,1,B00GOYHT1E,"This is a terrible DVD. It does not follow the Bible in any sense, nor is the story very emotionally enticing nor moving. This is my opinion. If you want a DVD to watch with no preconceptions, with no expectations, and with no sense of entertainment then this is for you.",1393804800,5,271,4.333333333333333
6097685,5,B00GOYHT1E,Excellent well done and heart felt great message,1467676800,,48,5.125
6097686,3,B00GOYHT1E,"Great entertainment, but a much different story than I have heard before.  Is not backed up by scripture, or even unaccepted scripture.",1467417600,,135,5.136363636363637

6097689,4,B00GOYHT1E,I bought this on Amazon video and this movie was not that good. The picture quality was great. The story in the movie was rather boring.,1457395200,,136,4.269230769230769
6097690,5,B00GOYHT1E,What a magnificent recollection of Mary of Jesus~Thisis the best side ever of her~ I loved this movie and have watched it several times already! LadyAnn68,1457049600,,154,4.961538461538462
6097691,4,B00GOYHT1E,Very well written story of Mary Magdalene.  I would watch it again.,1455494400,4,67,4.583333333333333
6097692,4,B00GOYHT1E,Interesting.  Mostly well done.  Could care less if it is strictly King James interpretation.  A little over acted in places but thought provoking and that is an important contribution.,1452211200,,185,5.310344827586207
6097693,4,B00GOYHT1E,"This was a fascinating speculation on what the background of Mary Magdalene might have been that put her in Jesus' path and then drew her into his movement.

It is strictly fiction, with only a few stories actually derived from New Testament stories about her -- it's an attempt to fill in the missing back story. But the fictional back story is very dramatic and plausible.",1449100800,6,374,4.666666666666667
6097694,5,B00GOYHT1E,"Beautiful drama. The movie is very well done; I would had expected do see Mary's interactions with Jesus to be many more and also was hoping they would give some glimpses of the friendship between Mary and Mary Mother of Jesus, John the Evangelist etc. the presence of John the Baptist makes the movie more spiritually anchored as it incorporates some scriptural scenes. I would say it's a novel based on some historical facts and also much imagination.  I still loved to have a new opportunity to hear about Jesus and Mary as well. A bit dramatic, some violence.",1441584000,,563,4.686868686868687
8625903,5,B00GOYHT1E,I like every thing about this dvd,1526342400,,33,3.857142857142857
8625904,3,B00GOYHT1E,"There have been a few very good portrayals of Jesus by actors which makes the stories about him so much more special. This actor is not one of those special actors. I'm sure that the churchy types will watch this movie and exclaim that the presentation was very good, ""divinely inspired"".. Nope. Jesus is rather cheesy in this rendition.",1525737600,,337,4.728813559322034

8625910,4,B00GOYHT1E,"This was insightful to Mary Magdalene prior to her commitment to Jesus. Her life and NO she was not a prostitute as many believe. She came from Magdala which the town was known for such activity and many related to her as such. However she was not perfect and made some back decisions based on her grief, anger then she met Jesus. She saw the error to her ways, her choices and the repercussions however Jesus performed one of many miracles she witnessed. Her conviction was clear and forever she followed him and spread His message, His Father's message. She was his ""Blessed"" Disciple and after she witnessed his suffering, death and finding he was gone on Resurrection Day to then see He indeed is alive, he rose. She was his faithful disciple until her death.  Very good movie.  I played Mary Magdalene as one of the 3 women with Jesus during his journey, his death included His mother, Mary and Salome for our church play this year. I did a lot of research and this movie gave me different insight to her soul, her emotions and love for Jesus, her Savior. Our Savior. High Recommend",1492905600,4,1087,4.540816326530612
