8050336,3,B0007PP5G2,The movie was quite entertaining but was lacking in depth. Sometimes the consequence of having sex with others could bring about a negative effect in a relationship.,1472688000,,165,5.148148148148148
8050337,2,B0007PP5G2,"This movie is pretty bad. There is a plot, but perhaps too much of one, too much dialogue and not enough action. There are some good scenes, but I'd like some more eye candy.",1228694400,,174,4.147058823529412
8050338,5,B0007PP5G2,"I don't regret making this movie even if it's not up to everyone's high standards...yeah, I mean you, T. Lester! It was a lot of fun to make and my co-stars and directors were amazing to work with. I started my career in the adult entertainment industry (I have had the pleasure of working for Matt Zane, Don Fernando, Ed Powers, Larry Flynt and Fallen Angel among others) at the age of 18. I can honestly say that Libido was my absolute favorite company to work for. I don't have a typical porn star look, and that's what makes the movie different. No one in this film is a typical ""porn star"". So I pity the hater who wrote that immature review...if you want a good laugh, maybe you and said bf should take a long hard look at your tragic sex life! Instead of being so negative, try making your own porn. I'm sure it'll be a big hit in the ""specialty"" section!

8050339,1,B0007PP5G2,This movie is horrible.  It was not enticing in the least.  After reading the other reviews I was excited to get this movie and thought that me and my boyfriend could have a nice quiet evening and watch something with some taste to help set the mood.  WRONG!!  We sat and laughed as we critiqued each and every horrible scene.,1167955200,,326,4.383333333333334
8050340,5,B0007PP5G2,"Remember when porno movies were actually movies?  Like 'The Devil in Ms Jones' and 'Debbie Does Dallas'.  This one actually has a plot.  And a good one too.  It's acctually a full length movie.  Although unlike the old school ones the sex is more explicit and no one has a forest growing down under.  Guys, this is a great one to watch with a date.  It's all about fulfilling your significant others' fantasies.  This one is actually the sequel to 'Thank You, Mistress'.  It has romance, deception, suspense and some humor.  The sex scenes are hot and REAL!  You won't see the girls checking their nails while muttering 'oh yes, give it to me'.  The cast is totally made up of 'the girl/boy next door' types.  No silicones, no prostetics just real people in a real life story with real sex and real orgasms.  Highly recomended by someone who's been watching porn for 20+ years.  You need this in your DVD rack!",1117411200,10,910,4.530864197530864
8050341,5,B0007PP5G2,"Urban Friction is in a class by itself..well thought out and sophisticated, yet erotic for men(easy to please) and women(like me..who are not). Visually hot with enough story to arouse the mind as well. This is definitely not your father's porn.",1110758400,11,245,5.0
