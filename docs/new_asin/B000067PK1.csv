7963507,1,B000067PK1,"While these movies and books appeal to contain good Christian moral values the fact of the matter is they are made to support the leaders of the cult formerly known as the Children of God, that changed their name to The Family International. Just like you wouldn't buy clothes you knew were made by child slaves, you won't want to buy these videos knowing that the people who made them are well known pedophiles. And ultimately the people most befitting from the sale of them are the Cult leaders themselves. All this information is well documented and easy to find with a quick google search",1457395200,,592,4.647619047619048

Follow the leader deals with Jesus calling us to follow Him. Not for pastors, priests and nuns, but for kids - like yours and mine, who live in an everyday world -- today. When I was a little boy, I really wanted to be called by Jesus, thanks to my dear mother, who taught me to love Him. But I was taught, sometimes directly, other times just in the way things were presented, that the calling of God in people's lives, especially children, was only something that happened long ago. It didn't seem to work the same today. This story turns that idea around, and encourages the kids that God can and wants to use them!

In Cherub Wings style, it's fun --even fascinating--, but it packs a message that's worth a lot. It touches lightly, but it develops the idea that Jesus has a plan for each one of us, and that if we are open to that plan, and want to know what it is, He will lead us in it, even if we're only kids.

As with the others I've seen in the Cherub Wings series (I haven't seen all of them), Follow the Leader is a strong Christian message, but it's not denominational or doctrinal. That is to say, it seems to be made to be acceptable by most all Christians, without causing disputes over controversial doctrines. It seems to be aimed at the grade school aged kids, but it's going to be hard for others in the family to leave the room while it's on. The cartoon graphics are very simple, but somehow they are very appealing to young and old.",1166400000,,1478,4.271428571428571
