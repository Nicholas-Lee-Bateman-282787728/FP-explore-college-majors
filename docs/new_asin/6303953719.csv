740212,5,6303953719,"The story is pretty lame, Mimi Rogers is a rich, hard nosed art dealer who  gets scheduled ""full body massages"" and the normal masseuse is  replaced by Brian Brown.  The attempts to give the film depth by using  flashbacks don't cut it and Brown's mysterious obsession with tribes does  not help either.  On the other hand, Mimi Rogers has never done this much  nudity in a film.  She is barely in a scene where shes not naked and oiled  up, so enjoy!  Where did you think those 5 stars came from anyway?",959731200,13,504,4.380434782608695
740213,5,6303953719,"I enjoyed the therapeutic and sensual theme of the movie, Wish another one can be done. I was indirect about the therapist avoiding his client being nude but still even made more interesting with a sense of suspense.",945302400,3,216,4.7105263157894735
740214,4,6303953719,"I love Mimi so this was a 'must view'. I am also interested in massage. Brian goes through the gamut which is unrealistic, but informative. The story is okay, but there is much too much talking during the massages. Mimi is in 'full view' most of the film which doesn't hurt. Trendy sets and non-linear story presentation make it an interesting film.",925689600,2,349,4.645161290322581

Loved this movie!!!!!!!!!
I loved it that ti was centered on just two people even though other actors were involved, but in such minute scenes. I used it as a life learning experience based on the topics both Mimi and Bryan talked about,,,,,,,,,,",1306972800,,304,5.224489795918367
740333,5,6303953719,"There are two really big reasons why you need to buy this movie: Mimi Rogers.

Really, this is a wonderful movie about two torn lovers; one who has loved and lost, the other who has lost before she even had a chance to love. Some might consider this as just a skin flick with good reason, as there are copious amounts of nudity all through out, but there is a great story that is told too.

The transfer is superb; full frame, crystal clear, bright colors, dark blacks, and no dust or particles on the film. Umbrella Entertainment went all out with this movie; it's a wonder that it isn't advertised as an all region disc, as they would definitely sell more.

If you are interested in buying this movie and are hesitant because it is advertised as region 2, then you should rest assured as this product is an ALL REGION disc.

This means that you can play this DVD in most U.S. stand alone DVD players and ALL computers with DVD or Blu-ray drives.",1297209600,3,947,4.363636363636363
740334,3,6303953719,"The plot is the title here as the dialogue requires a French nationality to believe in. That doesn't mean there aren't some good discussions here. It's just not ever the intended meat of the show. Worldly life philosophies don't put me off but I know they put some people to sleep. The cure is- turn volume down.

Starring Mimi Rogers (see my review title) & Bryan Brown from Gorillas in the Mist & F/X, Mimi puts her full body in Full Body Massage & Bryan Brown is one Lucky S. O. B. that gets points for being able to read his lines ( I doubt he could remember them). The cutting room floor was a good reason for this DVD to of had an outtake disk. We unfortunately didn't get one.

If you rent or buy this you already know why you did it. Please leave all Playboy & Penthouse excuses at the door. 90 min's of rub a dub-dub. Hubba, hubba. I do wish this had been a screen film. The cutting room would have gotten less.

740336,5,6303953719,"Slow moving with lots of dialogue, its actually a decent movie with good character development.

The big stars of the movie though, are Mimi Rogers very large and beautiful breasts. They pretty much steal every scene and are always on display.  They get touched, squeezed, teased and massaged--its a bit of a soft porn movie.",1239148800,5,325,4.890909090909091
740337,4,6303953719,"This movie is essentially ""My Dinner With Andre"" -- but with Andre as a woman and she's mostly nude.  Granted Mimi Rogers is a lot more fun to look at than Mr. Gregory (I can't picture her as Wallace Shawn...), but the long wordy conversation which runs throughout this film is just as shallow and pointless as Malle's original.  They talk about art, about shamanistic healing, about relationships and ""the differences between men and women"" -- but nothing is ever settled.  Both characters state their opinions and keep talking.  The gimmick of having one of them nude on a massage table is ultimately a cheap trick to keep male audiences engaged.

Nicolas Roeg often goes overboard on dialog in his movies (The Man Who Fell To Earth, Insignificance, Bad Timing) and also loves his ""ooga-booga B.S."" (to quote Nina) with all the crystals, magnets, colored scarves, totems, Hopi medicine and burning rope being reminiscent of Walkabout, Performance and Heart of Darkness.  Technically the film (a low budget made-for-TV) is sub-par, with harsh lighting, needle-drop score, zip for costumes or locations, and some surprisingly obvious errors with (for instance) on-again/off-again panties and a laughable fatal car crash with no damage.

I like Bryan Brown as an actor, and Mimi is delightfully mature and unselfconscious here, but this movie ultimately fails to deliver full satisfaction -- just like the massage of the title.",1227312000,3,1426,5.147186147186147
740338,4,6303953719,"Many items produce a Zen-like tranquility by focusing one's attention upon the very small, urging the steps toward enlightenment by inviting the notice of even the smallest detail.  Of this nature is square-foot gardening, the game of Go, and now, the viewng of Full Body Massage.  Though beautifully set in the Malibu Beach area and within a beautiful, art-filled contemporary home, the ""plot"" is restricted to the conversations and induced memories of a handsome masseur and his gorgeous mature nude lady.  They challenge and stretch each others' minds, taking us back to major events in their lives, all against the background of an erotically-enticing massage.  I really wish it were available in DVD - it seems only to be available on the private VHS market (i.e., eBay and the like), and I fear multiple viewings will wear out my video cassette.",1217289600,4,851,5.01418439716312
740339,4,6303953719,"Mimi is used to having her regular massuese.  And during these occasions, more occurs than just body rubs.  Browne shows up as a replacement. While possibly attracted to Mimi's lovely assets, he is a professional, not a gigilo. He proceeds to give Mimi a great massage. While doing so and getting into some deep talk, Mimi has flashbacks to intimate vivid encounters with the ""original.""  Special efforts are made to conceal private parts and Browne uses the towel very discriminately. At the same time, while not showing all, the early arguments and later conversation-
discussions become intriguing. Mimi is disappointed in not getting the real thing. At the same time, she is awaken by Browne's discourses into
philosophy and art.  Those who want to see Mimi in the buff will not be disappointed, although they may want 100%.  Browne's challenges in seeing
her desires yet continuing on as a professional massuese are fascinating to watch. At the end, one can sense somewhat of mental binding between the two, not giving anything away. Will she invite Browne back for some
discourse as well as a legitimate massage?  Is he turned off with her own way desire or aroused by the willingnexs to enter deep discourse.  There is little eroticism. There is lots of natural beauty and excellent
dialogue.  I view this film as a sleeper which more should see, but only if keeping in mind that this movie is not steamy like Eva Green's DREAMS
or Gemser's EMANULLE ON TABOO ISLAND.  I highly recommend it for all

740406,5,6303953719,"I first saw this movie on cable many years ago.  After a long

search I finally found it on an imported DVD.  Definitely worth

the price !  Aside from the fact that the viewer gets to see

Mimi Rogers nude, Bryan Brown turns in an excellent performance

as the masseur who fills in for Mimi's regular.  He explains the

origin of massage as a form of medicine to Mimi, ranging from

the ancients to the Hopi Indians.  The film also explores some

of his family roots as well as the woman who apparently taught

him some of the spiritual aspects surrounding massage therapy.

If you're into massage, or even Mimi Rogers, buy this one !",1118534400,15,635,4.408695652173913
740407,5,6303953719,"One of the few movies that stimulate your mind rather than just entertain.  Definitely not a movie for those who want voyeurism or just a visual thrill.  If you ""get it"", this one touches your head and heart and leaves you with as sort of ""I'd never looked at it that way"" ... and the ""it"" might be art, massage, sex, women & power, over-40 women who are comfortable with their bodies, or some other aspect that I haven't considered.  Try it, you'll like it!

Back when I was single, this was one of my favorite tests -- the ""best and brightest"" were turned on intellectually and physically and we went on to enjoy a healthy and stimulating relationship.  Those are now among my best friends, and Full Body Massage is still one of my favorite movies.",1099699200,13,750,4.445255474452555

740409,5,6303953719,"Oh... Well, you certainly couldn't sue the company for using a misleading title. Mimi definitely receives a massage. That cannot be in doubt. From the wrong man, though...
Yep, the Aussies and the Brits tend to pronounce it Mass-arge, rather than the US/Canadian M'saaaaaage or however the heck you would attempt to represent it phonetically.
Irrelevant really, given the amount of Mimi nudity, which clearly should be the main focus here. I'm sure Loverboy's right about the movie failing as a foreplay enhancer, in that the story flashbacks do tend to break the rhythm of the genuinely erotic mass-arge sequences.
Two decent actors here. Bryan has done many excellent movies both in and out of Oz - e.g. F/X 1 and 2 and the truly excellent Aussie Vietnam movie The Odd Angry Shot. Mimi... sigh... Mimi is just excellent, period.
Yeah, what's that about her being overweight? Hello, this is a real woman and she looks fantastic. I didn't find the story such as it is to be that appallingly mind-numbing, but no, this ain't Tolstoy. In fact, if you turned the volume down and put on a Philip Glass opera, you could treat it as an ArtHouse movie.
I am certainly waiting for the DVD. There are many times when the Step and Slow keys would enhance your enjoyment, as would the ability to skip flashback scenes.
What a beautiful woman. For Pete's sake, Bryan Brown got a paycheck for this movie. It's not right.",1078531200,8,1407,4.723577235772358
740410,3,6303953719,"This movie is such a disappointment because you really wish that there could be good acting and a good story to go along with the gorgeous Mimi Rogers -- but it's not so great.  If you want this erotic sexy movie soft-core you would be better off with ""Sexual Intrigue"" or even ""Body Heat"" which is not as naked a movie, but is very good acting and story.  To me, the whole point of these movies is to get the girls turned on for the rest of the evening activities, especially now that I have perfectedthe mastery techniques of the video ""New Sex Now.""  But this Mimi Rogers movie doesn't score the job so well because it's not a very compelling movie, so the girls don't get turned on, they just get antsy to go home.",1075766400,4,718,4.264705882352941
740411,3,6303953719,"I'm not going to go into the normal aspects of film review for Full Body Massage here because I don't feel they apply.  The reason this film is popular is because it contains Mimi Rogers' most extensive film nudity.  That is the reason most people will seek it out, rent it, or buy it.  Its also the reason the majority will like it.  The plot is so confusing and the dialogue so boring and talkative that you may find yourself turning the sound off.  Very quickly: Bryan Brown is a masseuse that fills in for rich Mimi's regular guy.  The entire movie is one long massage session intercut with flashbacks by both characters concerning their previous relationships.  I've told you too much.  It simply doesn't matter.  The nudity is excellent and Mimi has never done more.  I read one review that said she looked ""overweight"".  If that's overweight, keep up the good work.  Mimi looks great and is on display throughout the film, that's all most need to know.  Forget the plot & script, enjoy the view.",1070755200,50,1002,4.593220338983051
740412,2,6303953719,"Yes, seeing a very generous Mimi Rogers in her natural state can be delightfully enjoyable--for a while.  But eventually, over the course of seeing Mimi lying face down, Mimi's legs getting oiled, Mimi lying on her back, Mimi putting on a robe, Mimi taking off her robe, Mimi dragging the massage session from one room to another (What, no curb service?), the viewer begins to hope. . .beg. . .pray. . .for a story, any story.
Alas, FULL BODY MASSAGE has no story, only a monotonous, shallow, boring dialogue between Rogers and her ""substitute"" masseur, played by a poker-faced Bryan Brown.  A discussion of quantum physics would have been more entertaining as opposed to the psuedo-existentialism exchanged between the two characters, as Brown pinches, pops, plucks, probes, and palms Mimi's legs, back, and ample derriere.  We are also given the bonus of flashback scenes with both characters--scenes that, unfortunately, add nothing to the overall nonstory.  And at the end of the film, when absolutely nothing is resolved, the viewer is left frustrated and just a tad bit grouchy.
If I want to see Brown wax philosophical, I'll watch ""Cocktail.""  And if I wish to see Mimi, I'll simply pick out any number of countless frames of this movie and hit ""Pause.""  FULL BODY MASSAGE gets two stars for the eye candy:  at least, for as long as you can stay awake.

740414,4,6303953719,"I first saw this film on the Showtime Network and fell in love with the lack of self-consciousness in the characters.  It's a cross between ""My Dinner with Andre"" and a weekend at Esalen (Big Sur, CA).  I had a hard time finding a copy of this video, then went to Amazon.com and found it.  It was released on video by Paramount.  I highly recommend this video, if just to change your perspective on the high volume of pulp fiction coming out of Hollywood.

740481,4,6303953719,"I have this as one of my favorite and most under-rated films.  First let us define comments about nudity.  There is no female frontal nudity, below the navel.  Likewise, one can turn Mimi over and see a back and legs but little in-between. So the pure porn and sex lovers might not enjoy this. Go see one of Laura Gemser's films such as Emanuelle in Egypt for kicks.  One reviewer, who did outstanding analysis raised the concern that  the masseur felt $100 was too much.  Maybe he enjoys his professional and feels joy in helping someone relax. Indeed, he helps Mimi get some of the kinks out.  There are lots of objects of art shown in Mimi's palatal home. These contribute.  Mimi keeps having flashbacks to her normal masseur who satisfies her sexual needs, going beyond the professional limits. She is rather disappointed in Brown. There is some antagonism as she tries to bait him. Brown is cool and unflappable. He won't indulge Rogers by hand play but begins to engage her mentally through discussion.  Then there seem to be flashforwards to her and Brown frolicking together.  Flashbacks might be a bit detracting. This film must be studies a few times to observe the nuances.  The verbal interplay between Rogers and Brown is fascinating.  He takes to her and toward the end one can see Mimi finding a new relationship form with an intelligent, well
versed professional.  Mimi is beautiful. There is the pleasure that comes from observing a lovely lady. But her assets include the mind and personality.  Add these all together, bring in the cool, confident and inspired Brown: Eureka. This is a film for discerning people, not voyeurs.  I treasure it and can't await the re-watchings to learn more from their discourse.

740484,3,6303953719,A so unreal plot with senseless flashbacks. But Mimi Roger's bod rules -- no question about it. Don't bother about her acting (or lack thereof). Anybody who's interested in mature ladies' beauty just can't miss this one.,1018742400,4,220,4.972972972972973
740485,5,6303953719,"Ever rent or buy a movie for one reason, but end up having the film pleasantly surprise you for other reasons?  That's what happened w/me when I bought FULL BODY MASSAGE.
Granted, the primary reason most people (like me!) are going to purchase this movie is the implication that Mimi Rogers is going to be naked thru most of it.  Not to worry, the movie delivers in this aspect.  I HATE it when some flicks have the promise of being saturated with nudity, but come to find out there is maybe a grand total of 5 seconds worth in the entire film.  That's not the case with this movie.
Rogers has a unique, exotic elegance.  Hers' is not the type of beauty that you will find on a bikini poster.  Rather, her appearance has a much more serene and mysterious flavor to it.  This, combined with the fact that she is middle-aged, give this production a nice mature (not in the sexual sense), almost sophisticated tenor.
The other major character is played by the Australian actor Bryan Brown.  He doesn't seem to do too many roles, but he does pop up every now and again.  He is a massage therapist who ""sits in"" for the normal therapist of Rogers' character.  His accent is a nice touch, although I did get a bit tired of him pronouncing massage as ""mAssage"" (with a long A sound).
What is really refreshing about this film, however, is that it truly tells the story about both characters.  It also delves into the various aspects, histories and techniques of massage therapy.  Instead of being just a film for a male audience, I would argue that it is a borderline date movie.  There's a lot more substance to it than you may think.  The incidental music is also very fitting, giving the film an overall soft-jazz feel.
The only criticism I have is that Rogers' character only pays the masseuse $100 when its all over.  Then, she is told, $100 is too much.  That's an absurdly low cost.  First, given all of the myriad techniques that he did, he must have been there for hours.  I know that $100 won't even get you a HALF hour at some of the most respectable massage parlors.  Second, it would cost a whole lot more than that for the masseuse to come & set up shop at your home (which was the case here).  Third, given the fact that Roger's character lives in a bona-fide mansion & drives a brand new Mercedes, it is difficult to fathom her inviting bargain-basement massage therapists into her home.
All that aside, this is not just a good erotic movie, but is a genuinely good movie, period.  If you're a fan of Mimi Rogers, Bryan Brown and / or full body massages, this one is a can't miss.",1015027200,172,2589,4.419831223628692
