289624,5,6300269221,"I throughly enjoyed the movie Outlaw Blues.  Maybe because I had a small cameo role in it.  I was in nursing school at the time 1977 at Brackenridge Hospital in Austin, Texas.  They needed some protesters to hold signs that said Save Bobby. We were actually in school that day in our blue nursing student dress uniforms and we got to partcipate in the protest sceneand chanted Save Bobby,  I am the one at the end with the short black hair holding one of the protest signs.  There were two or three of us doing the scene.  This is why the movie is especially special to me, something to share with my children and grandchildren.
It is twenty five years down the road and I remember the movie like it was only yesterday and yes I did graduate to become a Registered Nurse.",1073174400,14,771,4.356643356643357
289625,4,6300269221,"This movie had good music scores and the story line believable!  Peter Fonda plays a good ""I only want what's coming to me"" kind of guy.  Susan St. James is great in her supporting role as the guardedly interested, ever so pretty woman who helps him hide from the authorities the prison warden has in his pocket, then assists him to further his career. Her belief in Peter's character makes the movie happen!
I'd like to get my hands on a copy of the sountrack!",1048204800,6,461,4.411764705882353
289656,5,6300269221,"... in this film? I remember seeing it when I was very young and just loving the story - convict writes song, big star and others in power steal the song, convict gets out on parole and tries to collect his rightful money and then a whole lot of trouble comes down ... despite all that, this is a very light-hearted romance between ex-con Peter Fonda and gorgeous (and amibitious) brunnette St. James. It's very 70's in every way - the dialogue, the wardrobe, the ""look"". If you loved this movie, you should get this disc. It was excellent quality and the packaging was very solid. I would definitely order similarly created product again.",1367625600,3,639,4.614035087719298

289660,5,6300269221,"Outline Blues was my favorite movie as a teen. I had a crush on Peter Fonda and thought Susan Saint James was gorgeous with her long hair and trendy 70's clothing. I searched for this movie on DVD for quite a while and finally found it on Amazon. It's funny how you remember things as a kid. Peter Fonda wasn't quite as cute as I remember and he can barely carry a tune, but the movie holds a lot of nostalgia for me. In that sense I love this movie now as much as then. The music is catchy and it's a kick to see Austin inside and out, having been there myself.",1311465600,,562,3.982300884955752

289662,3,6300269221,"This is a film that's hard to dislike but it's hard to recommend particularly at it's prohibitive price tag.  Essentially, it's the cinematic equivalent of a Chinese meal which is to say easily forgettable.  Some sporadic chuckles but not that many.  Susan Saint James and Peter Fonda do make an engaging screen couple, though.  If you can get this one as a rental do so.",1247270400,7,371,4.661538461538462
289663,5,6300269221,"This movie was very important to me because I watched them film some scenes at my dorm at The University of Texas at Austin in 1976.  They took over Dobie down on the second level.  I got to see Susan St. James up close and in person.  She was wearing Frye boots in the scene and I had to get a pair just like them.  I took a picture of Susan St. James wearing her boots on the back of a motorcycle before they filmed the scene.  I got a picture of Peter Fonda poking his head outside his trailer parked on Guadalupe Ave in Austin.  He only said a few words to us...""Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll.!""  That was so Peter Fonda in 1976.  I never saw the movie when it was finished.  It took me 32 years to find it on video.  Go figure.  Good times.",1236988800,5,744,3.9261744966442955
289664,4,6300269221,"Last night when I was thinking of music from movies I remembered Outlaw Blues. What a fun movie and it's been a long time since I've seen it.  It is a comedy but it also has some true heart.  Wish it would come out on DVD!
  I would recommend it for a fun evening movie watch for all.  Enjoy enjoy enjoy",1214784000,2,303,3.901639344262295
289665,5,6300269221,"i just saw this movie again and i have to say it's very good. peter fonda is a much better actor than everyone thinks. he also has his fathers easy going charm and isn't as shrill as his sister.sadly he has been stuck in low budget movies for so long that we forget how good he is.

  outlaw blues starts in huntsville prison texas where fonda is doing time and writing songs. enter james callahan as a johnny cash type who goes to the prison to make an album.fonda plays the title tune and is blowen of by callahan. weeks later the prison hears fondas song on the radio but it's callahan who is singing it and taking all the credit for it. fonda get out of jail and goes to set things right.in the fight that follows fonda shots callahan by mistake and the chase is on.

  fonda and st. james make a great screen couple and the movie is really fast paced and fun. a great way to spend some rainy sunday afternoon",1145318400,3,913,4.188571428571429

7807983,5,6300269221,"This is undeniably one of Peter's best movies...Peter Fonda's movies are witty, entertaining, funny, dramatic, expressive and uses may of the best performers seen in one movie...The story is a convict-muscian named Bobby Ogden who is serving at Huntsville seeks his rights after an act of copyright infringement sends Bobby who becomes a media-celebrity with the help of backup singer, Tina Waters (Susan Saint-James) in a confrontation with the country-western singer (Boo! Garland Dupree!) What follows is an extreamly funny, witty, exciting and entertaining motion picture! Buy this movie and Peter's other movies if you like to be entertained like I do. I have enjoyed this movie since I saw it for the first time in 1978. Here are some of his other best: Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry--Race With The Devil, Fighting Mad, Outlaw Blues, High Ballin', and Easy Rider. Don't miss OUTLAW BLUES!

7807990,3,6300269221,"It's easy to picture a movie today being made about record piracy and copyright infringement, but the topic was highly unusual in the 1970s when cassette tapes were the musical state of the art. So, Outlaw Blues was a 1977 oddity... a movie in which a man comes looking to get even against a thief who, instead of taking his car, money, land, or woman, took his prize song instead. The movie may have been unusual then, but it's a charming little oddity now.

Peter Fonda plays Bobby Ogden, a convict who writes a catchy country tune called ""Outlaw Blues"" and plays it for big time country singer Garland Dupree (a George Jones lookalike). Dupree likes the tune so much that he steals it and makes a #1 hit out of it. Bobby tries to confront Dupree but things go bad and he winds up on the run, aided by a savvy would-be manager Tina Waters (Susan St. James). Somehow, despite being a wanted fugitive, Bobby manages to record his own version of the song and goes around the state of Texas marketing and promoting it, with the increasingly flustered cops two steps behind.

Outlaw Blues is played strictly for laughs... we never believe for a moment anyone is in real danger. It's the type of movie that features incredibly inept and obtuse police wrecking their cars with great abandon in a series of silly car chases. However, Fonda and St. James have good chemistry together, and the movie manages to make a few points about the music industry that are still valid today. In addition, Fonda does his own singing, including the catchy title tune, and acquits himself well.

Overall, the movie is similar to a two hour episode of The Dukes of Hazzard with slightly better writing and considerably better acting talent. It's easy to see how the movie fell through the cracks over the years, but it's pleasant enough romantic comic viewing for an evening. The DVD is a Warner Archive Collection DVD-R, but the picture and sound quality are quite good for a second tier studio title from nearly forty years ago.",1391299200,3,2008,4.634831460674158
7807991,4,6300269221,"This is a campy, 70s movie, but I was in the background of one of the scenes and therefore had to have it for my collection.  Susan Saint James is a beautiful lady, but I think most would agree that she never looked better than she did in playing this part.",1386028800,3,257,4.03921568627451
