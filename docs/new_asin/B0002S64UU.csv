2116908,5,B0002S64UU,"I bought the tin when it came out.  I haven't watched all of the cartoons in its entirety but am happy that I have it because it is essential for collecting purposes.  I'm not referring to the fact that the dvd might increase in monetary value.  I wanted to explain that it is essential because they are classic Disney cartoons and who knows when they'll sell out and never see the light of day again on the dvd shelves.

You never know when you will want to watch a Pluto cartoon.  When that random time comes, I'm happy to know that I have it in my collection.",1115769600,3,562,4.214953271028038
2116909,5,B0002S64UU,"This 2-disc DVD set is a must have! Herein are contained 29 classic shorts spanning from 1930 to 1947, in the first of what will likely be a 2 volume collection. Included are some of Pluto's, and Disney's best cartoons, from the Oscar winning remake ""Lend a Paw,"" to the first appearance of Chip `N' Dale in ""Private Pluto."" Here is a rundown of what you get in this wonderful DVD set!

Disc 1:

The Chain Gang (1930): In this black and white Mickey Mouse short, Mickey is a prisoner in a chain gang who, after musical antics result in a riot, makes a break for it! Two bloodhounds, officially considered the first appearance of Pluto in a double role, are hot on his trail.

On Ice (1935): In this early, color Mickey Mouse cartoon, the whole gang is enjoying a day on the ice, but Donald Duck's prank playing nature puts Pluto in the spotlight.

Pluto's Quin-Puplets (1937): In this familiar classic, the first ""official"" Pluto short, we meet Pluto's family, as his mate, Fifi, leaves him to watch over their 5 puppies while she goes after some sausages. The outcome of which is a drunken Pluto and a fascinating paint catastrophe, resulting in some bizarre looking pups. Great short!

Beach Picnic (1939): Donald Duck, the official star of this short, sets out to have a picnic on the beach with Pluto in tow, but the day is spoiled by a familiar flypaper routine and those pesky ants! The Duck and the dog are GREAT together!

Bone Trouble (1940): Butch and Pluto battle it out over a bone here, the highlight of which is that famous funhouse mirror routine that saves the day! Great moments with Pluto in the hall of mirrors!

Pluto's Playmate (1941): While Pluto is playing with a ball on the beach, a seal takes interest and becomes determined to make friends, despite the dog's resistance. Classic type of Pluto story, to be repeated again and again in future shorts.

Canine Caddy (1941): Mickey heads out for a game of golf, but Pluto and a gopher louse things up!

Lend a Paw (1941): This Oscar winning short about kindness to animals is pure Disney magic! Surprisingly, it's a remake of a black and white Mickey short! Great story about Pluto regretfully rescuing a drowning kitten that starts to take his place in Mickey's home. Pluto's devil and angel make their most memorable appearance in this one!

Pluto, Junior (1942): Pluto's pup, Pluto Junior, can't seem to stay out of danger, even in his own backyard!

The Army Mascot (1942): Pluto notices how well fed the local Army mascots are and decides to try to replace one of them. He foolishly chooses a grouchy goat!

The Sleepwalker (1942): Pluto meets his second great cartoon love, Dina the Dachshund, in this classic short. However, he's more interested in hanging onto his bone than sparking romance. Too bad his sleepwalking is working against him.

T-Bone For Two (1942): Pluto and Butch the bulldog clash again, in another epic battle over a bone.

Pluto At the Zoo (1942): This excellent short is full of animal antics, as Pluto attempts to steal a bone from a lion's dish at the zoo. Love the gorilla scene!

Disc 2:

Pluto and the Armadillo (1943): On a trip to Brazil, Pluto's ball gets mixed up with a friendly Armadillo in a brief stop off between flights! Very cute short that features Mickey, too!

Private Pluto (1943): Pluto is given orders to guard a cannon from suspected saboteurs. To our delight, those saboteurs are Chip `N' Dale in their first ever appearance! They're living in the gun and using it to crack and store their nut supply!

Springtime For Pluto (1944): This rarely seen, very colorful Pluto short is a pure delight! It's rarities like this that are the gold nuggets of the Disney Treasures series! The Pan-like Spirit of Spring awakes Pluto to a bright new day, but his enjoyment is eventually smothered by the down-sides of nature.

First Aiders (1944): Hooray, Pluto and Figaro! This short is one of those great Disney team-ups that features a star from Disney's ""Pinocchio,"" Figaro the cat! In this old fave of mine (I love Pluto and Figaro shorts), the boys battle it out while Minnie attempts to practice her first-aid skills on them.

Dog Watch (1945): This is another fave of mine! Pluto is a Navy dog, and is given orders to keep intruders off the ship. A pesky rat causes trouble for him though, setting his sights on the ship's galley!

Canine Casanova (1945): Pluto is madly in love with Dina, but can't get her to return the sentiment, until he rescues her from the local dog pound!

The Legend of Coyote Rock (1945): Another old fave! Pluto is a sheepdog that has to fend off the legendary Bent Tail, the coyote!

Canine Patrol (1945): In this short, Pluto works for the U.S. Coast Guard and takes his job a little too seriously, doing his best to keep a cute little turtle off the beach!

Pluto's Kid Brother (1946): K.B. can't stay out of trouble, and he badly needs big bro Pluto's help when Butch tricks him into robbing a butcher shop!

In Dutch (1946): Pluto is the local milk delivery dog in a little Dutch village. He and Dina get in trouble one day, when Pluto's wooing results in a false dike alarm sounding off. But, when the dike actually does spring a leak, it's Pluto and Dina who save the day!

Squatter's Rights (1946): Chip `N' Dale are back to torment Pluto again, when Mickey and Pluto find them living in the stove of a cabin they are vacationing in!

The Purloined Pup (1946): A wealthy puppy has been dognapped! It's up to police dog Pluto to locate the poor pup in the hideout of the number one suspect, Butch the bulldog!

Pluto's Housewarming (1947): When Pluto is moving into a luxurious new doghouse, he discovers an unwanted houseguest in the form of that cute little turtle. He has bigger things to worry about, though, when Butch decides to move in too!

From the Vault: Pantry Pirate (1940), separated due to ethnic stereotype content: Pluto does his best to sneak food from the kitchen without the housekeeper suspecting.

From the Vault: A Gentleman's Gentleman (1941), separated due to ethnic stereotype content: One of Pluto's best cartoons, Pluto is the perfect dog to his master, Mickey, and takes every aspect of his role very seriously, including going to the corner to buy a paper.

This is a fantastic collection of classic Disney cartoons, necessary for the Disney or Pluto fanatic! Extras include introductions from Leonard Maltin, Pluto 101 (an in-depth look into drawing and animating Pluto), The Life and Times of Pluto (a featurette about the pup himself), Pluto's Picture Book (a section of the Disneyland TV Show episode ""A Story of Dogs,"" that focuses on the career of Pluto), Pluto's Pal Fergy (a tribute to Norm Ferguson, the animator credited with developing Pluto), fantastic photo galleries (including Sunday comics, posters, backgrounds, etc...), a DVD booklet, a certificate of authenticity, and a lovely collectible poster art card. The packaging has gone a little cheaper than past releases (no more paper wraparounds, no more printing on the back of the tin), and I'm getting more and more annoyed with only getting half-episodes of the Disneyland TV series. Will it kill `em to give us complete eps? Otherwise, another outstanding Disney Treasures set! Can't wait for the next wave, and Pluto volume 2!",1113955200,37,7282,4.723756906077348
2116910,4,B0002S64UU,"This is a nice collection, but these are far from the best Disney shorts. I'd catagorize most of them as ""pleasant"" rather than ""funny."" Pluto works best as part of a team with Mickey or Donald. Pluto on his own can be a bit bland. The best shorts in this set are ones where he has a strong comic foil like Chip and Dale in ""Squatter's Rights.""",1113350400,4,344,4.149253731343284
2116911,3,B0002S64UU,"...but having watched both this and the 2nd color Mickey collection, I think a lot of the Disney cartoons pale in comparison to even the minor Warner Brothers or Tom and Jerry shorts.  Don't get me wrong: there are certainly classics in the Disney cannon.  (I own and enjoy the Disney Treasures Complete Donald Duck as well as the must-have Wartime Collection.)  These Pluto shorts are cute, pleasant and dull. (At least Donald has an edge and some bite to him!)  I can imagine enjoying one as part of a matinee at the movies, along with a feature and some newsreels, but grouped together, their blandness became wearing after a while.  The Looney Tunes Collections, however, are sets I NEVER tire of watching over and over again.  Maybe it's their clever adult humor, the double entendres, their refusal to talk down to their audience.  The Disney shorts seem made for kids...and I'm not a kid anymore.  Hey, I still adore the Disney features.  ""Dumbo"" and ""Pinocchio"" and ""Peter Pan"": animation films just doesn't get any better.  But these shorts are a little too middle of the road for me.",1108598400,6,1093,4.735449735449736
2116912,5,B0002S64UU,"...the tins this year have a pretty tacky paper back cover instead of the attractive printed-on covers that were done in Italy.  The last wave of treasures was delayed due to problems at the Italian facility; in order, to make the Christmas rush, they probably went plan B on our current treasure wave, though its nice to see them housed in white double Alpha keepcases.  I don't really care if the edition numbers are stamped on the can: the more collectible low-numbered cans would have been hoarded anyways and truly collectible items sell in the mere thousands (not 130,000).  The Roy Disney autograph band went with Roy himself when he resigned from the Disney board to protest Michael Eisner's leadership.  I'm not a Pluto fan (the MM club is the best one), but at these prices, all treasures are a steal.",1102377600,11,811,4.7304964539007095
2116913,4,B0002S64UU,"This series is a dream come true since the first day of DVD. But this year the back cover is not printed on the tin but only a piece of paper poorly sticked to the box so it immediately falls apart! Also the ""bond"" around the tin was not included anymore. Beginning last year they stopped hammering the number into the metal. Cheap treatment for a prestige article.",1102291200,13,365,4.382352941176471
2116914,4,B0002S64UU,"In the latest offering from the Disney Treasures collection, pluto gets his chance to shine in 28 classica animated shorts.  Since this is not all of them there will certainly be a volume two.

Among the Gems in this collection:

""The Chain Gang"" featuring Plutos first appearance.

""The Army mascot"" A classic from WWII, Pluto longs to be an Army mascot (especially after he sees how well they are fed) so he hatches a plan to take the place of the real mascot.

""Private Pluto"" another WWII classic, Pluto is in the infantry guarding a pillbox from saboteurs.

""Pluto Junior""  - Pluto's young son wants to play and fight to the exasperation of Pluto who only wants to take a nap.

""Canine Caddy"" Mickey goes golfing with Pluto as his caddy.

As with the other sets there's a slew of extras:  Leonard Maltin introductions, ""The Life and Times of Pluto"", ""Pluto 101"", Pluto's Picture Book (Excerpt from ""A Story of Dogs""), Pluto's Pal Fergy, Still Frame Galleries.

More classic animation from Disney.",1097452800,17,1001,4.761627906976744
2116915,5,B0002S64UU,"It was rather predictable that Pluto would be the next of Disney's 'Big Five' to get the Treasures treatment now that Goofy's back-catalogue has been exhausted. Mickey has had all of his colour cartoons released under this series and this new wave of 'treasures' will complete his black and white releases. We are still waiting for Donald to appear in the second (of possibly four?) volumes.
After Donald and Mickey, Pluto was the most prolific of the Disney cannon and the problem that may arise, as it already has done, is on over-lapping other titles. Pluto is the definate star of such cartoons as Pluto's Christmas Tree and The Simple Things and yet they, and many others, appear in the Mickey volumes. Hopefully this will be more of a companion piece to the existing titles.
With Disney floundering with it's new output, it has really grasped with both hands the profit in it's archival stuff but obviously this is limited. There is definately more room for further Silly Symphony releases but how about a volume devoted to Ludwig Von Drake's appearances on the Disney TV shows? Chip 'n' Dale shorts (although limited and starring other head-liners)? Or Disney's True Life Adventures? That another of this year's releases is The Mickey Mouse Club, I worry that some 'barrel-scraping' has already begun.
Although I value and look forward to the new Disney Treasures releases, I can't help but worry that the true treasures will soon be exhausted. And that would be a pity.",1092441600,16,1477,4.888446215139442

 Although I'm not a big fan of the character Pluto and would not be interested in watching several Pluto cartoons in a row, many of his cartoons are fun and funny. Most of the shorts were well-animated with interesting stories. Lend A Paw (#7, 1941) won an Oscar for Best Cartoon.

I am disappointed that all the 48 cartoons are not in this set and I will have to wait a year or two for the remaining Pluto cartoons, since several of my favorite Pluto cartoons are in the last cartoons.",1091491200,107,2711,4.550209205020921
2116917,5,B0002S64UU,"Great service - product arrived 2 days before due date in perfect shape. Very good price on this hard to find DVD Disney set.

Discs were perfect - all paperwork included!

Pluto is great - he's the only Disney animal that's stayed a Animal if you know what I mean. The artists and writers have managered to infuse a lot of emotion and wonder in what could have been a very limited character.

Recommended - I would rate this a very good 8.5 to 9.0 out of 10 stars!",1407369600,,465,4.202247191011236
2116918,4,B0002S64UU,"My first impression of this set was that there were too many repeats for a set featuring only 28 shorts. Pluto Disney's resident hound starred in 48 shorts, but appeared in many shorts with his comrades Mickey and Donald. This two disc set, The Complete Pluto of Walt Disney Treasures volume one is the second release of Wave 4. It seems a little light in comparison with the other sets up to this point as the extras and amount of shorts for Pluto's solo career were probably a little too heavy for one volume, but a little too light for two! ......so sadly Disney went with two volumes that fall just short of greatness.

The biggest problem isn't so much that they are giving us at least 5 cartoons from other releases, but that they didn't even give us half of the character's starring cartoons here and the extras are extremely light. On the first disc there is a short bio on the character and his creators and another short featuring one of Disney's top animators showing the process of drawing a cartoon and animating a character like Pluto. Both pieces are interesting, but too short to fill the void of at least another half dozen cartoons.

Disc two has 15 more shorts broken up into two sections 13 standard and 2 From The Vault. The cartoons on both discs look great and the two From The Vault sections haven't been seen in years because of those nasty stereotypes. Once again, I'm glad they are intact here so we can remember the way things used to be. The disc also includes a gallery and a few short features that are interesting, but nothing that makes this set feel ""complete"".... Still, this is another quality set even with its shortcomings. The cartoons looks great and they are uncut, there is some back history here and if you only want to collect Pluto you will get a good dose of his better shorts.",1378339200,,1823,4.504531722054381

2116925,5,B0002S64UU,"Walt Disney Treasures has made some impressive releases and Pluto volume one is not going to be the most discussed, but it's a great volume to own if you're a Pluto fan. My favorite Walt Disney cartoon character is Pluto so this was a must have for me. The two disc DVD set is kept in a tin can which looks impressive at first but can get scratched up easily just a warning. Included inside the DVD case is a ""certificate of authenticity"" and it displays the number of DVD sets available, only one hundred ten thousand! I recommend buying Pluto volume one before it goes out of stock because if it does sellers will be selling this set for outlandish prices. Also included is a little collectible card which was originally a poster for the original theatrical release of ""Bone Trouble."" And to get you started with volume one has a DVD pamphlet which briefly discusses what's going to be on this set. I was truly impressed with the packaging but I'd just like to say, why aren't Pluto's ears black? Right directly on the DVD cover you can clearly see Pluto's ears are the same color as the rest of his body. I'm wondering if this was a mistake, or the image of Pluto was originally colored in that way. Oh well, it's still a great set.

Now I've discussed about the packaging but what about the character himself, Pluto! I just love Pluto, his facial expressions are priceless and the animators did an unbelievable job. It should be difficult making seven minute cartoons with a character who doesn't speak but somehow it can be done obviously. One of my favorite scenes with Pluto is from the 1935 cartoon ""On Ice"", Donald Duck has put ice skates on Pluto's paws and he's having such a difficult time getting up and he keeps slipping around on the ice. It would be pretty difficult to make Pluto as funny as he is if he were subtle, he needs over the top expressions to get the point across. Pluto's emotions come from the eyes not the mouth, oh and his tail too.  : )

Pluto volume one includes twenty-eight Pluto cartoons and each one has been restored and re-mastered. The black and white ones still have quite a bit of grain, but you can see much more improvement on the cartoons featured in color. I'll list each cartoon below in there chronological order.

While yet this two disc set includes twenty-eight cartoons, it also has a few short features. In ""Pluto 101"", Leonard Maltin meets with Disney animator Andreas Deja and he shows Leonard how to draw Pluto and how studying classic cartoons can help the animating process. Another feature is ""the Life and Times of Pluto"" which discusses...well the animated dog Pluto, who else. A feature from disc two is called ""Pluto's Picture Book"" which is an excerpt from ""A Story of Dogs"" a Disneyland TV episode. ""Pluto's Pal Fergy"" is a nice tribute about Norman Ferguson; Norman Ferguson helped create the character Pluto. And also included with this set are a few galleries. Even though Pluto volume one isn't packed with extras at least their interesting ones, and thankfully no games!

If you're a fan of Pluto, I'd recommend volumes one and two before their out of stock. If you can get your hands on either one be glad you did because these are truly rare and special DVD's.",1279670400,2,3939,4.703649635036497

we own both 1 and 2 and we love them!!",1174262400,4,313,3.7846153846153845

I would like to warn about what you just may get.

Disney Treasures come in tin boxes. These days Amazon is not capable of delivering them without damage.

If you getting this product as a gift, or as a collector's item, or simply like to receive your buys in mint condition - shop elsewhere.

I had to return Pluto DVD two times, since every time it came all dented ...only to receive another artfully bent tin, along with cheerful assurances from support that Amazon is trying to do their best.

On a third strike, I give up.

No, I do not make fuss over a slightest ding. Nor it is a single occurrence. Out of 3 delivered Disney Treasures DVDs (Pluto, Donald, Rarities) _not a single one_ came clean.

Whether as a single package, or as a part of a large shipment; whether due to inappropriate packaging (soft envelope), or due to packing-in already damaged tin - result is the same.

Caveat emptor.",1165708800,8,985,4.433333333333334
2116932,5,B0002S64UU,"I think that Disney has done an excellent job with Pluto Volume 1 and corrected most of the miscalculations that they made in previous sets.

First, they included principal cartoons in Pluto's career that cover cartoons not released under the Pluto banner like ""The Chain Gang"" (A Mickey Mouse Cartoon), for example.  The set also presents a peculiar set of cartoons (The Oscar winning ""Lend A Paw"", ""Canine Caddy"", ""A Gentleman's Gentleman"", and ""Pluto and the Armadillo"") that are officially Mickey Mouse cartoons.  I've seen some of these cartoons presented as either Mickey or Pluto cartoons on both VHS sets and on The Disney Channel.

Second, Disney presents the cartoons in chronological order.  I prefer this method over the ""Best of"" collections that were put forth in Mickey Mouse in B&W Volume 1 and the first Silly Symphonies set.  Chronological organization of cartoons can best allow you to notice how a character evolves.

Third, Disney included the PLAY ALL disc option and reduced the number of silly easter eggs.  After a long day's work, I would prefer to just click and play rather either skipping from cartoon to cartoon or indulging in some treasure hunt to find a rare cartoon.

Yep.  They got it right this time.  Let's hope that they finish off this series.  This one is the best of WD Treasures collection so far, production-wise in my opinion.",1155513600,5,1370,4.908695652173913

2116935,4,B0002S64UU,"Volume 1 of a collection of cartoons that highlight Pluto's career from 1930-47. Pluto always seems to attract the small-fry, as his cartoons are aimed squarely at them. Though, Pluto is not one of my favorite Disney characters, his shorts are well animated and executed with the same level of professionalism that was put into any Mickey Mouse or Donal Duck cartoon.",1130371200,4,367,4.935483870967742

8031101,5,B0002S64UU,"Great collection of cartoons. What I have noticed is that many of the pluto cartoons are going to be found in the Mickey collection, because, well, they are master and dog. What I didn't like of this collection is that it doesn't have some of the original shorts in black and white- because they are in the Mickey collection but have the ""Pluto sunbeam intro"" to them.",1478390400,,368,4.507462686567164
