7666259,5,B01BQPZVPQ,"The Knick season one was a phenomenal achievement for Cinemax with Brilliant and Honest storytelling. That being said, Season two had many side-stories that took away from the overall narrative and feeling that season one gave us. We did not see Thack near enough and when we did we rarely got a glimpse of his genious creative mind that made him so spectacular and thrilling to watch in season one. I am still awarding season 2, 5 stars, because even if it doesn't hold a candle to its previous season, its still fantastic to watch far better than most everything else on TV.",1471737600,6,576,4.601941747572815

7666286,5,B01BQPZVPQ,"My husband and I rented this series, and loved it.  We bought it for our daughter, who is a surgical nurse, and she really enjoyed it.  It is utterly amazing to compare medicine today to medicine around 1900, and that's just a bonus surrounding the compelling stories of the characters in this drama.  I enjoyed both the first and second season, and am sorry they never made more than that.",1487894400,,390,4.542857142857143

7666288,3,B01BQPZVPQ,"This is a show with a lot of potential; but this season was marred by two things: (1) Most people are unlikable or they become unlikable.  So many of the people are portrayed as not just having a character flaw or two, but as being fairly evil.  (2) The sexual morality presented in this series is not too far removed from today's morality.  3 or sex sex scenes per episode is pretty common.  No nudity that I can recall.",1486857600,,421,4.291139240506329
7666289,5,B01BQPZVPQ,My favorite TV show EVER!,1486684800,,25,4.2
7666290,5,B01BQPZVPQ,"The promise of Season 1 carries over in Season 2. Also, now Nurse Elkins is truly THE star of the series. Is there an actress any better than Eve Hewson who doesn't even need to say a word and just give a subtle look to keep the storyline moving. Truly a talent beyond her years. Another star to emerge is Zaraah Abrahams who plays Algernon's mystery wife, Opal.

All of the storylines (SPOILER ALERTS) are delicious from Bertie's return to Barrow's outrageous moves up the social ladder and his surreptitiously dumping of his wife. I guess Clive Owen only had a two-year contract as the ending is a shocker even though when the operation is planned I thought this can only end badly.

The DVDs are worth getting for the extras. There are ""Post Ops"" after each episode that do mainly deal with the medical procedures and give you background on the real medicine of the time as well as how the props department made the amazing bodies the doctors and nurses work on. Knicktoids are small cool facts on the stuff you see in NYC of that era. Both of these are after each episode.

There's a whole slew of extras after you're all done with the season:
Under Construction is a super indepth look at how the sets are made and we really see how the lighting is done to create the 1900s' mood.
Costume Shop has some really fun conversations about Algernon and Cornelia's costuming.
The Ball shows just what a genius Steven Soderbergh truly is as that incredible ballroom episode is explained to the nth.
Behind The Scenes looks at the issues that crop up in the season from addiction to feminism.
Two stars emerge in the extras--the set designer Howard Cumming and costume coordinator Ellen Mirojnick.",1485302400,,1693,4.617940199335548
7666291,5,B01BQPZVPQ,"What an amazing show -- Soderbergh really knocks it out of the park, both visually and story-wise.  The fact that he acted as director and cinematographer for the entire series gives it a narrative and tonal consistency missing in so much TV these days.  And the last episode.....mind-blowing.",1484784000,,293,5.083333333333333
7666292,5,B01BQPZVPQ,Awesome season and great show.  Interesting to see how early medicine was practiced .,1484438400,,85,5.071428571428571

7666308,5,B01BQPZVPQ,"Season 1 hooked me immediately with the depiction of turn-of-the-century medical procedures and other historical details. Doctors, nurses, society folk, prostitutes; drug addiction, syphillis, abortion, corruption, mental illness! This show will have you gawking and hiding your eyes as well.

Season 2 delivered some plot twists and shocks, but nothing seemed unbelievable.  I often lose interest when series creators start focusing on minor characters and introducing new ones, but every storyline in The Knick has engaged me (a good thing, since you can never count on your favorites making it to the next episode). I watched both seasons with my iPad in hand, I constantly found myself searching for more information and explanation of what I was seeing!",1483660800,,758,5.415254237288136

7666313,5,B01BQPZVPQ,"I started watching this show on a whim, basically out of boredom. I never expected to become obsessed and needing more. I binged right through the first and second seasons and am so hopeful that they continue this. As a nurse, I really enjoy medical related programs. I'm also very interested in history and culture. There's so many things we take for granted and we forget that things weren't always so easy. If you have a thing for Gregory House, you will love Dr Thackery",1483142400,3,474,4.588235294117647

7666317,5,B01BQPZVPQ,"While I liked season one more,this bold, original show is still the best hospital drama. Equally fascinating as season one but with more shocking plot twists than the first season. This set also has more extras than the first season's set,though still not very much. All said I highly recommend this series.",1480809600,,307,4.923076923076923

7666319,5,B01BQPZVPQ,WOW what a ride for a series. First season left us wondering about would their even be a second in many ways it was so far out there. Glad to see it's back. Haven't watched it yet...but do know we'll be pulled in just like last year. Also Murdock fans.,1480032000,2,252,4.06
7666320,3,B01BQPZVPQ,"The Knick's second season didn't seem as strong as the first, but there was a good bit of character development, especially Tom Cleery, whom I thought would be a minor villain but instead turns out to be a decent guy, at least compared to the real villains, who reveal themselves in time for next season.  He also provides some comical relief from time to time.  Overall, I enjoyed the second season and am looking forward to the third.",1479945600,,436,4.576923076923077

7666322,4,B01BQPZVPQ,"Season 1 set the hook and Season 2 added more bait. While you may watch this show with your eyes covered due to the many gross-out treatments and conditions of the time it portrays, you will continue to watch to see what happens next with all the characters. Good acting, great story-line. Hope there's a Season 3!",1478304000,2,314,4.526315789473684

7666335,5,B01BQPZVPQ,I bought the first season of The Knick not having heard about it all before. I bought it because I hadn't seen Clive Owen in anything for a while and I had zero expectations - and was pleasantly surprised. The second season is just as good.,1477440000,3,240,4.239130434782608

7666343,3,B01BQPZVPQ,"After my very enthusiastic five star review of season one, it pains me to say that season two drops back to earth.  It is still worthwhile TV, but not worth a special trip, as it were.

This season the plot devolves into a combination of soap opera and a mediocre and predictable murder mystery.  The sharpness of characterization in season one is blunted, the characters develop in more paper cut-out ways, and the actors seem to react by sleepwalking through some of their parts.  Only the ambulance driver and the ex-nun retain their first season snap.

MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!! SKIP THIS UNTIL YOU""VE WATCHED THE SHOW:  As an additional medical point, the adrenalin they had synthesized probably would have saved the life of the ex-wife of the main character when she died of an anaphylactic response to ether, but was completely wasted on the main character as a bled out from a sliced artery.  I found myself shouting at the screen ""the adrenalin!  The adrenalin!""  as the young woman expired.",1475539200,,996,4.811764705882353

7666348,5,B01BQPZVPQ,"Absolutely perplexing series! It truly is amazing to watch as the reenact the early days of medicine. It honed my skills with medical terminology for school as well. LOL I will not spoil the ending for anyone who has not seen it through yet, but I will say I am not sure how they will continue on with the series after this season. Very surprising ending.",1474502400,,355,4.393939393939394
7666349,5,B01BQPZVPQ,The Knick is one show that pushed the edge of what a medical drama should be.  The Knick focuses on the rise of modern medicine and makes you really thankful for where it is now.,1474070400,,178,4.085714285714285
