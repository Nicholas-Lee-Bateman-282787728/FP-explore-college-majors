A MUST HAVE for people who want to get clear but are reluctant to do the work!
This video is marvelous because it works at the deepest levels of your subconscious mind in order to help you purge all those feelings of anger, hate, resentment etc etc..

I strongly believe that people who have placed negative reviews here about this product are getting results, they simply don't know how to identify them.

Let me explain.  The first time I watched, I was incredibly ANGRY within a few hours.  That would seem like quite the opposite of what was supposed to happen.  Not so! What happened was that the video helped me to unlock that deeply embedded anger so that I could release it, so I got angry and it was over with.. It is no longer within me.

I realize that this is a rather simple explanation, but I would like everyone to understand that this video does work.  EVeryone is different so give yourself an opportunity to release.

Watch it consistently, and I guarantee that you WILL start to notice the results!",1217808000,9,1261,5.392857142857143

Positive would be an understatement, so let's say ""miraculous!""  All you have to do is watch! I am a licensed clinical psychologist, and I believe this new technology actually works.  If you are wise enough to buy this DVD, watch it multiple, multiple times, listen and follow the directions, and see what happens.  I believe these people are trustworthy.

8165109,1,B000LXGVJK,"I love The Secret and own many, many manifesting audio and DVD programs, so I looked forward to Subliminal Manifestation.  This DVD is awful.  I would have been disappointed had I spent even $8, let alone $80 (I purchased it directly from the website).

Please save your money on this one.",1171411200,76,289,4.627450980392157
