8627781,4,B00GV8B1QM,"I rather enjoyed this movie, which I believe was a straight to video release.  I know that doesn't sound too promising but if you like campy-style horror, you may find yourself enjoying this little nursing home romp.  Dawn Wells of ""Gilligan's Island"", wearing a blond wig no less, leads a cast of mostly over-the-hill ""D"" List Celebrities in this flick and still looks pretty smashing.  Some other names you may know if you are 50+ and/or were part of the ""Summer Re-Run Generations"" like Lee Meriwether (""Catwoman"") and Rip Taylor (""Sigmund and The Sea Monsters"", amongst other epic pop culture fare) pop up along with some newer faces trying their best to manage this motley crew of Nursing/Rest Home Inmates throughout the film.  I am not going to reveal any real details about this movie, except to say there are some interesting sequences tucked in at various moments to keep you going to the end and again, viewers with a taste for black humor may find this worth a look.  The film apparently is not available for purchase right now but can be viewed on Instant Video for just a fistful of dollars.  Give it a try!",1474675200,,1121,4.66497461928934
8627782,1,B00GV8B1QM,"I wanted to see this film because Dawn Wells starred in it. I've never heard her talk about this movie and I think I know why. It's easily one of the very worst movies I have ever tried to sit through in my life. Not funny, stupid plot, terrible film. I wish I could turn back time and not have even wasted my time watching it.",1466121600,,327,3.9696969696969697
8627783,3,B00GV8B1QM,Terribly silly movie full of aging character actors and stereotypes...but also quite funny in spots. Worth a rental or a cheap buy like I made.,1432512000,,143,4.76
8627784,5,B00GV8B1QM,What fun! It was great seeing all these older Hollywood and Broadway stars come together for this entertaining comedy.,1424044800,2,118,5.2631578947368425
8627785,5,B00GV8B1QM,"What an awesome throwback to comedy horrors of the 80s and 90s!  I stumbled upon this flick on Direct TV and thought why the heck not?  It's got a bunch of famous, lovable old-timers and a clever little title/tagline combo.  I was literally smiling the entire movie and it had a few great laugh out loud moments.  It's totally a ""popcorn movie"" that you can enjoy late at night with a loved one or a few friends.  It's nothing brilliant, but it's charming, fun and has a nice vintage feel to it, like it was made in another era of filmmaking.  It's a shame there hasn't been a bigger marketing push on this, I could see it doing really well on TV, especially with the ""baby boomer"" generation.  There's definitely an homage to Mel Brooks, as I think I'd read somewhere, and major kudos to all the actors, writers and directing.  It's definitely a little gem that I'm happy to add to my collection.",1416614400,,897,4.426829268292683
8627786,4,B00GV8B1QM,"I don't understand the poor review this film received, as I thought it was a hoot! It has a great cast, many laugh-out-loud situations, etc. Sure, it was campy, but that only added to its humorousness, in my opinion. Be aware that it's a low budget, indy comedy. With that caveat in mind, though, I recommend you give it a chance. If you're anything like me, you'll find it was well worth the cost of the rental. In fact, writing this review has tempted me to watch it again!",1402531200,2,475,4.348314606741573
8627787,1,B00GV8B1QM,"Don't waste your time on this movie.  Ridiculous plot, ridiculous script, ridiculous characters with screechy voices.
The movie's title was half right - it was deadly, but far from silent.

I was hoping to see Dawn Wells show some of her acting talents, but I couldn't make it through half of the movie.  Even though I paid to rent it, I turned it off.",1395532800,,352,4.46875
