8529444,5,B008P76WNY,"This is a fascinating Blu-ray in many ways. First and foremost, it marks the 75th anniversary of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. Curiously, as good as the concert is, I didn't really detect extra emotion from the players or audience related to this major occasion. But the accompanying documentary (nearly an hour long) fills this gap nicely.

The documentary effectively charts the history of the orchestra, hitting all the highlights. Benefiting from a large number of interviews with orchestra members past and present, it shows how the orchestra has attracted stellar musicians from around the world, originally largely from Germany and Austria, and more recently from Russia. It also touches on Arturo Toscanini's early championing, Leonard Bernstein's injections of excitement, and the five-decade relationship with Zubin Mehta, who has helped the orchestra maintain its Central European sound through all these years. I found it very interesting, and as you might expect, moving in parts.

The concert features a rather eclectic program. Two French violin works (Saint-Saens and Chausson), Bach, Chopin and Beethoven. One bit of trivia: All the soloists are former child prodigies.

Mention is made in the documentary of how Jewish musicians are particularly skilled at making string instruments sing, and certainly Julian Rachlin and Vadim Repin do just that in Saint-Saens' Rondo Capriccioso and Chausson's Poeme, respectively. Rachlin follows the Saint-Saens with an encore: Bach's Partita No. 2. It's equally impressive.

But I suspect for many the highlight of this disc will be Eugeny Kissin tackling yet again the Chopin Piano Concerto No. 1. He made his international splash with this work at the age of 12 in 1984, and six years later it was his calling card when he made his North American debut (with Mehta at the podium). If he's tired of the piece, he hides it well. Every effort shows in his face as he plays, making this one occasion where I found seeing the performer distracting. There are grimaces galore.

I did a side-by-side comparison with another performance of this Chopin concerto on Blu-ray (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garrick-Ohlsson-Plays-Chopin-Art-of-Chopin-Blu-ray/dp/B0064X1G5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garrick Ohlsson Plays Chopin: Art of Chopin [Blu-ray</a>]), and I have to say I much preferred Ohlsson's lyrical, sensitive approach to Kissin's more driven, intense one. Ohlsson clearly is enjoying himself, whereas Kissin makes it seem hard work (which it is, of course). I'd place Ohlsson in the Michelangeli-inspired camp and Kissin in the Rubinstein one, if that helps you decide which you'd prefer. There's certainly room for both approaches. To cap off his part of the program, Kissin does an exciting encore: Chopin's Scherzo No. 2.

The picture quality on this disc is excellent, as is the DTS 5.1 surround sound. By the way, the Ohlsson Blu-ray's sound is equally good, but it suffers from highly variable picture quality. The footage is either sharp or soft depending on the camera used, and the rapid cutting and overly creative camera angles don't help. One thing I've learned from watching quite a few concert Blu-rays is that less is more. When you become aware of the director's choices, the ""you are there"" spell is broken. Unobtrusive direction -- what the 75th anniversary disc provides -- is best.

The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra Blu-ray ends with an energetic, expertly played performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 8, which is often the neglected stepchild between the composer's more popular preceding symphonies and monumental final one. Not sure why it was chosen for this 75th anniversary program, but the performance itself really can't be faulted. It demonstrates the orchestra's refined sound and its symbiotic relationship with Mehta, providing a fitting conclusion to this milestone concert.

I was provided with a review copy of this particular disc, although I've purchased many EuroArts discs (as well as those of other classical music labels) over the years.",1373846400,3,4151,5.565768621236133
8529445,5,B008P76WNY,"The Israel Philharmonic does its usual superb job, especially when under the direction of Mehta. Kissin gives a spectacular performance of Chopin. And the DVD has an fantastic added bonus about the Israel Philharmonic with commentaries by Mehta, Barenboim, Zuckerman and many others connected with the Orchestra",1370217600,5,311,5.638297872340425
8529446,5,B008P76WNY,"This 75th Anniversary concert, recorded in 2011 at Tel Aviv in Hanger 11, is a spectacular success on every level. Clearly this anniversary meant a great deal to the players and audience and the whole event rises to the occasion in a way that is really quite special.

The concert starts with an assured and exciting performance of Saint Saens' Introduction and Rondo played by Julian Rachlin who adds a thoughtfully satisfying Sarabande from Bach's second Partita as an encore. Expectations were high therefore as Kissin settled down to deliver as fine a performance of Chopin's fist piano concerto as I have heard. This was full of detail and nuance without, for a single moment, losing the wonderful effect of spontaneous music making. The number of meltingly beautiful moments throughout this concerto were almost beyond number. Interestingly it was not a brilliant performance in terms of virtuoso speed. Those characteristics, which he demonstrated at Warsaw on a previous anniversary concert (Chopin's), were put aside in favour of a more deeply expressive interpretation here - not that there was any lack of brilliance at the essential moments of pure display passage work. At the end of the concerto, which was justifiably greeted with rapturous applause, it was a pleasure to see Kissin react with more relaxed pleasure than usual. He followed this lyrical performance of the concerto with a positively blistering account of the second Scherzo which was simply jaw-dropping.

'Follow that!' you could say - and that is what Vadim Repin did with a wonderfully expressive account of Chausson's multi-layered and evocative Poeme, the perfect complementary piece to balance Kissin's extraordinary display of brilliance in his concluding Scherzo performance. This was a deeply musical and satisfying performance and made one realise yet again what a shame it is of such an awkward length to make it a difficult piece to program in to concerts. A fine piece indeed and unjustly neglected.

The concert fined with a bright and cheerful performance of Beethoven's 8th symphony. This was not short of dramatic attack, with every accent and phrasing detail clearly observed and which made a fine ending to an outstandingly successful concert. Mehta's quality as a conductor is quite evident throughout this concert and his vibrant input was clearly an important factor in drawing out the very best from the players in front of him. His position as the orchestra's chosen Musical Director for life can be easily understood on that basis.

The recording was of excellent HD visual crispness and definition and much the same could be said of the sound quality which is presented in excellent DTS surround and stereo formats.

There is a 52 minute documentary about the orchestra which charts its conception, development and plans for the future. Members of the orchestra comment on its organisation and their family links with the orchestra which, in many cases, goes back generations. An emphasis is made upon the orchestra's special European sound and their corporate love of performing. The orchestra these days is made up of several nationalities but the essential characteristics are jealously and proudly maintained. This was an engrossing documentary.

I would suggest that this very fine concert disc should warrant serious consideration by any purchaser interested in the varied program, the various soloists or in the orchestra itself. The whole presentation is enhanced by a very good documentary as briefly described above.

Another Excellent Review, Ian!
I have had this on my Wish List for some time, but other Reviewers, on both sides of the Atlantic, were lukewarm.
Thank you for your enthusiastic recommendation, and the telling little details which convinced me to order this.
p.s. Others have scoffed at Zubie's Musicianship over Many Years (along the lines of Lang Lang's Detractors) but you can't downplay his enthusiastic and energetic Conducting going all the way back to Los Angeles and New York!! (U.K. review)",1359158400,4,4145,5.277693474962064
8529447,5,B008P76WNY,"This is a superb DVD. I particularly enjoyed the fascinating documentary ""Coming Home"". It is a great companion to ""Orchestra of Exiles"" - which is a must-have!
Musically, I enjoyed the solo and orchestral performances, as well as the fine Blu-ray quality. Thanks, Amazon!",1358121600,2,272,5.204545454545454
