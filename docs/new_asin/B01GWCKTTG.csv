There they enter the bizarre world of the transvestite, Dr. Frank-N-Furter, who creates life in the form of a perfect young man, intended for his pleasure. Thereafter, nothing goes according to plan. I recently attended a live performance of The Rocky Horror Show and was so impressed I had to see the film based on the musical. The stage show was high-energy camp with amazing choreography! The horror musical comedy film mirrors the stage musical but lacks its explosive, imaginative choreography and the audience participation. It makes a difference. The Rocky Horror Picture Show drags at times, but overall maintains its energy with a powerful rock score. I recommend seeing the film because it is a unique viewing experience, but if you can find a professional stage presentation of the musical, thats a must-see experience.",1532217600,,972,4.969325153374233
