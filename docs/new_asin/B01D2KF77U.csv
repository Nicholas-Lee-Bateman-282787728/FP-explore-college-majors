7696224,3,B01D2KF77U,the movie was just ok... the acting is mediocre at best.  at times the story line gets a little confusing and blurred.  The ending of the movie is poor and leaves you hanging.,1462406400,5,175,4.2727272727272725
7696225,5,B01D2KF77U,"A gently paced, finely acted, vignette of young people, twenty-somethings, struggling to connect, living in the big city,
and like real life, never quite resolved.",1462320000,3,163,5.56
7696226,3,B01D2KF77U,Very drawn out movie.  Ending was weird with no closure.,1462233600,2,56,4.6
7696227,3,B01D2KF77U,"This is a rather mixed bag of a film which is difficult to categorize. The story primarily revolves around a young man named Gavin who appears to be searching for companionship and possibly even love but it seems that he isn't exactly sure how to go about it. One night Gavin (played by Jack Falahee - ""How to Get Away with Murder"", ""Lily and Kat"") who positively exudes smouldering sexuality and his BFF Amy (played by Ella Hatamian) return from a party to Gavin's apartment which he shares with another female who is out of town for the time being. There on the floor in front of them is an attractive young man who has passed out near the apartment door. Jack decides it's safe to take him in and allows him to stay for a couple of days. The young man (played by Giles Matthey) is a mystery. Why is he there? Why did he come to NY? Who or what is he looking for? It is obvious that some sort of attraction between the two begins to develop but what will it lead to (NO Spoilers here). Amy, who is trying to recover from a
recently broken affair, may also have latent designs on the mysterious stranger which really isn't that clear.  This only needlessly serves to confuse Jack's feelings. Unfortunately, this movie moves at a snail's pace; and there is a great deal of suspicion (some probably justified) and unresolved emotional ambiguity that prevails during the stay of the newly acquired ""guest"". A lack of air conditioning throughout the entire apartment adds to the difficulty. Jack's forthcoming birthday party is the focus of a considerable part of the film and its actuality leads to the finale. Some might rightfully conclude that the major theme of this film is ""looking for love in all the wrong places"". But is it love that is really being sought? As a study of the contemporary plight of youthful early 20-year-olds who must contend with raging hormones, sexual orientation, self awareness and discovery, as well as what professional road to follow, this film is somewhat engaging but its ending may also leave the viewer to wonder: What was that all about?",1462147200,15,2075,4.623306233062331
7696228,3,B01D2KF77U,"The story is there but not enough.  The dialogue is poorly written with awkward silence.  Characters are shallow and atypical of NYC.  Who read this script and thought ""this must be filmed?""  It's a shame 2 good actors--Jack Falahee, Giles Matthey--are in it but they both went on to do bigger things.  Their acting is good, despite the writing, but others shouldn't quite their day jobs or should look for a different line of work. If you have nothing else to watch, this might be good.  Just don't expect much excitement.",1500768000,2,523,4.6923076923076925
7696229,4,B01D2KF77U,"Constantly surrounded by noise and people, living in Manhattan & Brooklyn actually can be superficial and isolating, especially if you are 21/22.

Knowing people to invite them to a birthday party is no sign of a meaningful relationship.  Some people just don't want to be alone.  Some people are desperate to not be alone.  Companionship can be misinterpreted as caring.

It takes a mysterious 23 years old man to upend established modes of behavior.  He passes out in front of strangers's apartments.  Either that's  only asking for trouble or is a sign of reckless self-destruction or both.  Talk about depending on the kindness of strangers!  Can he be believed?  Can he be trusted?

Gavin (Jack Falahee) is evasive and noncommittal as he uses others.

The acting was quite good.

The ending did leave more questions unanswered than answered.",1500163200,4,846,5.036231884057971

Everything is done as a teaser, but you remain about as unfulfilled and ignorant at the end as you were at the beginning. It's as if someone prepped a bunch of people for a movie, but then forgot about the movie. Maybe they want you to imagine your own movie because they couldn't settle on a story.

I liked the pointless and unresolved ending because that's exactly how everything feels when you're 21 or 23.  Having said that, I have to agree with the person who commented that if the actors -- and especially Gavin -- hadn't been so easy on the eyes, this movie would have been impossible to sit through in its entirety. If you're looking for the typical Hollywood movie with beginning, middle, and an end where everything gets neatly tied up and explained, you will be hugely disappointed by this film.  Personally I was not disappointed and in fact would say that this is one of the few ""Amazon Prime"" movies I've watched, that wasn't a complete waste of time.",1487376000,9,846,4.516339869281046

Yet, in the end, this film winds-up not being so interesting, because we never find-out what motivates these individuals and why they are so morose and brooding. Good lord, if this is any kind of commentary on the twenty-somethings living in the big cities, we're in big trouble! Carter, the fellow who winds-up on the doorstep, has the most interesting details revealed, but we never learn why he responds as he does and what's holding him back from a very big event in his life, which is the reason he's in the city. It's all very dark and murky and maybe that is the view and feeling the writer and director wants to evoke, if so, mission accomplished, but it makes for a rather monotone and dull film.

It captures the searching ambiguity of life that contemporary urban millennials face.  The small set of characters are all in search for a relationship in some way or another, whether it be romantic, sexual, or familial.  Their identities aren't fully formed; they are all unsure of themselves in one way or another, which leads to missed connections, misread signals, and innocent yet clumsy encounters.  That being said, this is not a comedy, but a serious, quiet film.  All of the characters are quite developed, and the film's ending is much like the lives of the characters, intentionally unresolved.  Some may not like the slower pacing or unresolved storylines, but the film is successful at capturing a snapshot of the angst-ridden lives of these characters.",1462579200,10,884,5.02054794520548

The character of Carter is deliberately shrouded in mystery, so the viewer never gets an idea of who he really is as a person! Is he gay, str8, bisexual or asexual? It seems we are left with the impression he is a 'Mama's Boy' dotted on by a possessive mother?
 The unresolved ending made this movie a candidate for a sequel! In one of the subtleties the author of this narrative leaves with us is when Carter discovers he left chain medallion his mother gave him at Gavins apartment, he goes up to the entrance to go in and get it, but stops, turns away and in a sprightly walk heads for the airport!

8754731,2,B01D2KF77U,"I don't care if an ending is happy, sad or keeps you guessing. The only positive for this ending is that it happened. Many reviews described this well. When it started it looked like it had promise, but went down hill very fast. Summary, good looking people who were shallow, sad or clueless.",1524268800,,292,4.528301886792453

8754733,5,B01D2KF77U,"It's just life, at least for some young people. The movie reaches no conclusion, beyond one of the lead characters is a mean drunk, but not mean enough to really matter. Overall, it was fairly pleasant. Characters take chances and who cares if they don't go much of anywhere. There is no apocalypse to be found in this, and I'm not looking for one.",1513555200,,348,4.453125
