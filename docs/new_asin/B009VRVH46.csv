5369396,1,B009VRVH46,"Seriously...I could have made this movie myself for 100 bucks in my living room. Terrible, awful. My kids kept asking ""where's the doggy bunny""  You saw a dog with rabbit ears on it for about 15 seconds and that was it, but they didn't hesitate to color easter eggs for 15 flipping minutes. awful. We turned it off halfway through.",1364083200,10,331,4.516666666666667
5369397,1,B009VRVH46,This movie is an embarrassment to movie making. I watch a lot of kids movie with my kids generally they are ok to great. But even as bad kid movies go this is rotten.,1363737600,15,166,3.911764705882353

5369399,1,B009VRVH46,"Thankfully we didn't buy this movie, we just checked it out at the library. This movie deserves a ZERO star rating! My daughter picked it up because of the cover and the summary on the back. This is not a kids movie. The plot is about a girl desperate for a boy's attention. Add that to horrible acting, directing, and the fact that you can even see the cameras, and this movie is not even worth one star. We didn't even finish it. Instead we put in Tinker Bell and enjoyed the rest of our night with a GOOD kids movie without teenager relationship drama.",1398297600,,555,4.295238095238095

5369401,2,B009VRVH46,"The reviews about the movie quality are very true for adults and probably order children. My 6 year old granddaughter unfortunately enjoyed it and will probably watch it again. Fortunately we did not buy the movie because I would be very upset. We saw it on NetFlix. The next time she chooses to watch it, it will be alone.  If she wants me to sit down with her, my choice will be something different.",1397952000,2,401,4.418918918918919

5369403,1,B009VRVH46,"I feel others have made this out to be worse than it is-- it's not really worth watching for laughing at it. It's just unpleasantly bad. I also read a review that said this was made in a day, and I know that isn't so. Here's why.

Throughout most of the movie one of the characters had an excessively raspy voice. It was weird and left me wondering for the longest time what was wrong with that woman. Did she have throat cancer, I wondered? Well, toward the end of the movie it got worse-- she had laryngitis-- literally. (""In real life"") At that point her voice was nothing more than whispering in that awful laryngitis-y way. They filmed even though she couldn't speak! But don't worry! She went on a short drive in the movie and arrived at her destination with an inexplicably normal voice. So, there's three days: Not sick, coming down with laryngitis, and having laryngitis.

This movie has no redeeming qualifies except that I think Jake (August Roads) is adorable and very believable, very natural.",1397260800,,1006,4.614525139664805
5369404,1,B009VRVH46,"My daughter chose this movie because of the cute Golden retriever in bunny ears on the cover.  We are 40 minutes into the movie and I have yet to the see Golden Retriever or anything close to a decent film.  This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.  The directing is horrible, and the acting is even worse.  There are multiple plots, all of which make no sense at all.  So, when your kids ask to watch just save yourself the brain cells and say NO.",1396483200,3,456,4.078651685393258
5369405,1,B009VRVH46,My son loves air buddies and we have seen each one 100 times so I saw this on netflix and decided to add some variety. Horrible...so bad...has anyone ever made it to the end? We couldn't take it. On the plus side Space Buddies looks like it should be up for an Oscar!,1395705600,2,267,4.056603773584905
5369406,1,B009VRVH46,"Oh my God, it's horrible! I counted, and the egg dying scene was only five minutes long, but it felt like fifteen, and about a third of it was recycled. If you look at the kitchen clock during the egg dying scene, you can see it go back in time up to an hour and a half! The egg hunt scene lasted ten minutes, I checked a clock. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!!! You are likely to lose about a quarter of your brain cells as you watch it! It is awful! Here are some highlights:
The dog is ugly and not the one in the picture
The dog is telepathic because the director was too lazy to make his mouth move
The mom writes books by talking into her iPhone, and her story is awful
The background music abraded my soul and haunts my nightmares
The description has nothing to do with the film
The girl is stupid enough to answer the door in a bunny suit and then blames it on her mom
If the family is Jewish, why do they own an Easter bunny suit that fits the daughter, and why would they buy one?
Don't most Jewish people know what the easter bunny is?
The boy, Jake, is absolutely hideous!
The egg dying scene is long and awful with repeating shots
The girl and her mom are painting random ugly splotches on their eggs instead of patterns
The mom mentions an Easter bonnet but never wears one
The girl makes up a story about her twin when she could have easily explained why she was wearing the bunny suit
The mother supports the twin lie
Jake's mother clearly has laryngitis
Beth's friend is obviously a creeper
The egg hunt scene is torturously long with recycled shots
""I am the easter bunny puppy, pooping out easter bunnies""
The glue on the fab rou egg was showing
Ok, the whole thing just sucked.",1388016000,10,1690,4.203076923076923

Why does this have to be my kids' favorite movie? It's melting my brain. Toddlers are entertained by this movie and yet playboy bunnies are referenced, as well as the fact that the girl's dad ran away to Mexico with his secretary. And the girl with a Malibu home complaining about her life is very annoying. Oh it's just so bad.",1373760000,2,506,4.696629213483146
5369408,5,B009VRVH46,"This movie was the best movie I've ever watched!! I loved all 6 plots including, but not limited to:
Cheesy romance
false identity
the theft of a painted gold Easter egg
a poorly written book.

I watched this movie again,and again. My psychologist found a significant drop in my IQ, but it still gets better every time I watch it. (She thinks I may have a brain tumor!)
My favorite part was the Easter egg painting part. It was 15 minutes of nonstop recycled scenes, so that you can appreciate the magic all over again! Jolly good fun! I love this movie and so do my friends. Ignore the hateful reviews. They really break my heart. That is disrespectful to my favorite movie of all time, which was directed by a hard working young 5 year old who lives near Hollywood. Don't be a hater! Watch ""An Easter Bunny Puppy"" TODAY!

5369409,1,B009VRVH46,"This is a very bad movie!  Some movies for kids are bad, but this is just too terrible for kids to even watch. It sounds cute, a puppy who wants to be the Easter Bunny, but his family thinks dogs are dogs.  NOT what the movie is about AT ALL!  The dog on the cover shown isn't even the same dog as in the movie.  Of course, we watched this to see just how bad it would be, as this company makes the absolutely worst things out there.  Shame on Amazon or anyone for even carrying this!",1369526400,3,484,3.948453608247423
5369410,1,B009VRVH46,"THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL AND IT BORED MY GRANDMA AND I SO MUCH!!! A total waste of time! Do not listen to the good reviews, you'll regret it! I do not understand how this dumb thing even got on the market! It is supposedly an animal movie. The dog barely showed up. THE COVER IS DECEIVING. The back cover hardly tells what it's about. It is more like a cheesy romance movie. I also watched another movie, called ""A Talking Cat"" that had the same cheesiness, the same director and a same actress as ""An Easter Bunny Puppy""([...] They also contained the same house, the same set, the same sound effects, and the same footage of a river(yes, this is sadly relevant). There were even 2 scenes that were irrelevant to the story. The first one was LITERALLY an ten minute scene(or more) of the girl and her mom painting eggs. It went on and on and on. It was really boring. The second scene was LITERALLY a fifteen minute scene of the main characters running around the backyard finding eggs. It looked like it was a home video and they played some footage twice or more. This was also very boring. The dog has just about nothing to do with the story except (SPOILER ALERT) when he bites the bad guy's trousers to make him drop a gun. That is pretty much why he is important. LAME. There would also be random footages of a river in the movie having no relevance to the story at all and made no sense. There would also be weird holes in the script when something would magically be somewhere convenient. SPOILER ALERT: In the end, the dog had a heavy gold egg loosely tucked under his collar and hanging off of it like a bow.
When he shows it to the girl, she takes it off of the collar in her room and does not put it back on. But in the next scene the egg is magically tucked back under the adult corgi dog's collar. In short: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY BUYING AND WATCHING THIS JOKE OF A MOVIE. If you want a cute animal story for your child, get ""Kipper the Dog"" or ""Clifford."" They're really cute :)!

5369411,1,B009VRVH46,You and your children will only be stupider for having watched this movie. There was not one single redeemable thing about it. The dog isn't even cute. (and the dog on the cover is not the dog in the movie.),1367107200,6,207,4.2

5369413,2,B009VRVH46,"So it has no wiener dog with bunny ears at all.  By about 3/4s into the movie,  the actual plot begins.  To say it's slow would be an understatement.  Too much cheap background music that doesn't fit,  and ""funny""  comments from a little mutt doggy.  A girl lying that she's two people for no real reason,  and the search for stolen fabrege eggs.",1365206400,2,346,4.380952380952381

5369417,1,B009VRVH46,"WARNING: Your children will be pretty bored watching this movie

Believe me, I was pretty entertained by how awful this movie was. Those familiar with A Talking Cat?! will find themselves watching the same movie again:
the music, the setting, some of the shots have all been recycled for your viewing pleasure. But this is not what disturbed me. It was this:

the movie begins with the puppy telling you, the audience, that the reason you can hear his thoughts is you suddenly now have telepathy!! What a way to break the fourth wall, and it gets worse along those lines. During the first thirty minutes, you will soon realize that the movie alludes to itself. Examples include the puppy mentioning that the puppy on the cover isn't the same; the mystery writer mom (I'll get to that in a second) uses the movie poster as the book cover.

And here's where hell breaks loose. This movie is actually a couple of main plots:
1. a mom trying to write a book
2. the daughter takes on two personalities to win a boy because she was mortified with him seeing her in a bunny suit. She felt this was the best way to remedy that embarassment. This branches off from the book writing concept.
3. The lover interest's father has been jailed because it is claimed he stole a Faberge egg that's worth 5 million dollars. (In actuality, the egg cost probably a dollar. I mean, it was painted gold with fake rhinestones pasted on it!)

Besides these ridiculous plots, let's not forget the production value. Camera work isn't the problem. It's the pacing of certain scenes of the film. Why are we watching them paint eggs for ten minutes?? The worst offender takes up CLOSE TO HALF OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE: the Easter egg hunt. It just seemed so sloppy and seemed like filler. I'll give A Talking Cat?! credit for being much more cohesive, though it wasn't Oscar worthy. Also, I liked the foreshadowing in that film when it is mentioned a guy speeds down that road every time. While this was a nice device, it sets itself up for predictability. And a ridiculous scene where everyone laments for ""a severely injured"" Duffy. He seemed fine to me. Just a bandage loosely wrapped around his head and he was walking around. don't see why they were so upset (I cannot stress enough how ridiculous this scene was)
Continuity errors. The biggest one was that the puppy drops the egg. Then, it the following scene, the puppy had the egg tucked back in its collar.

If you want to laugh at how bad it is, then this movie is for you.
However, if you're looking for quality family fun entertainment for the whole family, you may want to back away immediately as it's poison for the mind.",1364169600,13,2653,4.541841004184101

Some of the scenes are even recycled (like the cars driving on the highway and coloring Easter eggs).  The kids were bored because there wasn't much at all about a puppy, not to mention that the cute puppy on the cover of the DVD isn't even in the movie.  The dog in the movie spent only a few moments dressed as a bunny. The story dragged on and the acting was awkward.  There were really no redeeming qualities about the movie.  Stay away from ""The Halloween Puppy"" as well, by the same director - it was just as awful.",1412121600,3,653,4.192
