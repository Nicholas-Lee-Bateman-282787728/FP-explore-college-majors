6338187,5,B00J806VWY,"Awesome movie for anyone who remembers the old ""G-Force"" and ""Battle of the Planets"".  Just goes to show what a good budget can get done.",1398643200,4,137,4.48
6338188,4,B00J806VWY,"I have not seen the English language version of this I watched it all in Japanese so my review may not be 100%. I agree with the previous reviewer it is a good movie despite many harsh reviews. I must say that I am a little bias because I used to watch the anime as a child casually as it was well before my time. The original Battle if the Planets movie is a classic piece of anime. This movie starts out with great action then hits a long lull with character development then finishes strong. The dialogue at some times seemed very silly and so did the special effects which bothered me a little but how realistic can you look in bird costumes? I could compare this to other Anime inspired live action movies ""Casshern"" which seems overly long and literally beats a sad desperation into its viewers with violent and poignant scenes. I would also compare it to ""Goemon"" which is a masterpiece in cinematic and directorial cinema and is strong in plot, character, and special effects, but is not directly inspired by any anime but anime movies themselves. The last movie I would compare it to is Space Battleship Yamato which is very different from the original anime but still an excellent movie. The Gatchaman movie is a lighter movie than Goemon, Casshern, or Space Battleship Yamato. This Gatchaman movie does not receive as high marks for me as Goemon or Space Battleship Yamato which were both 5 star movies. However, it does fit with being at least a 4 star movie like the live action Casshern which follows its anime roots in similar fashion. I would recommend this movie to fans of the original anime but warn you may be slightly disappointed. I am bias towards liking this movie for nostalgia reasons. The original anime and movie were very good but Gatchaman crowds is a pile of rubbish. The plot of this movie does vary considerably from the original if I remember the original correctly, it has been a while. I would recommend this movie to both fans and non fans alike because it is a decent movie and because I realize that unfortunately this movie has recieved a lukewarm reception by westerners. I would say overall this is a very enjoyable movie.",1397606400,,2164,4.594315245478036
6338189,5,B00J806VWY,"I grew up watching G-Force (Gatchaman) as a kid. It was amazing then, and it's amazing once again. This movie has some of the most over the top super hero action I've seen. If you can imagine it in a cartoon/anime, it happens here, with real people. Some may be less than happy that while the movie has English subtitles, I don't believe it's localized for Western audiences. What this means in basic terms is that some of the subtitles won't make as much sense as they would if they were written for a Western audience. This actually makes it even better to me, as I don't have to wonder if the dialog has been dumbed down for me.",1397433600,7,631,4.310924369747899

6338191,5,B00J806VWY,This was a good import movie. There were some technical issues since this was a 0 region disc.  If you were a G-Force or Battle of the Planets fan this is a must have! Watch my review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37oxZC1gHeM,1433462400,,233,4.9743589743589745
6338192,4,B00J806VWY,"When i first saw this come out in japan i was so excited and tried in vain to find a leak somewhere to watch it. i was so happy when my checking finally lead to a purchase. It's just as cheesy as you would expect, the fighting scenes are way computerized and the gatchaman i remember as a child. The captioning is a little off but it's simple enough to rearrange to make the sentence make sense. i loved gatchaman as a kid so i was not disappointed with this movie. Great for nostalgia purposes and with it being Japan it is cheesy in parts. i will give you a hint and say that like Marvel movies you will want to watch until the end credits, it's only five seconds about, but it makes me think enough to wonder!",1429401600,2,712,4.129496402877698
6338193,5,B00J806VWY,"Zone 1 so good with american DVDs players. Case opens backwards just like anime book. In Japanese but English subtitles. Nice story. Flashback sequence may be a little confusing, but great realistic costumes bringing classic cartoon to life.",1426464000,,241,5.368421052631579
6338194,2,B00J806VWY,"There has been a trend in live action remakes of japanese animated series and some of them have been terrific and respectful of the source material, this is not one of those. Unlike the live action yamato this diverges heavily form the original story adding characters and  such that don't really fit. the story is disjointed and hard to follow partially because it makes no sense and partially because of atrocious dubbing.
While bad it had some enjoyable moments and some charming elements your money is best spent elsewhere especially if you are a gatchman fan.
not so bad that i wouldn't burn the dvd for warmth if stranded in the arctic but pretty bad",1424908800,2,656,4.7043478260869565

6338199,4,B00J806VWY,"I like the way the animation has been translated to the big screen.  To some degree it has the feel of a more adult version of a Power Rangers movie. That may not be surprising since Gatchaman was one of the shows that laid the foundation for team shows like the Power Rangers. But I do expect that a movie made in 2013 would have special effects that significantly go beyond what movie goers saw in the 1995 ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie"" theatrical release.

Having said that, the story is more compelling than any that I recall from the original series. The acting and dialogue is better than I expected with a good balance of humor and drama. Tori Matsuzaka is competent as Ken but Go Ayano really owns his role as Joe. Ayame Goriki and Tatsuomi Hamada do well with what lines they are given but I really think Ryohei Suzuki as Ryu is the weak link here.

If you are a fan of the genre or the original TV show this is worth your time. But this is not a place for a newbie to start.",1419638400,2,996,4.231578947368421

6338222,2,B00J806VWY,"The copy I received looks like a bootleg with its poor printing and shabby looking DVD. The movie was passable, but the DVD quality was sub standard. The subtitles were in Engrish, not English. I won't be buying from this seller again.",1405382400,2,235,4.619047619047619

6338224,3,B00J806VWY,"The DVD sold here looks to be the ""Hong Kong version"" aka a version that is not quite official. The disk itself is good quality, no extras but the subtitles are bottleggy and are not that good. Its especially weird throughout that Condor Joe (aka Jason on BoP) is called ""Joe"" throughout the movie but the subtitles constantly refer to him as ""George."" What's especially weird is that there's an infographic IN the movie which also names him as ""George."" So.. I don't understand. Many of the subtle nuances are lost.

The story is dense. Unfortunately, it completely removes the team from any familiar context from the show, which I think is a mistake. For example, the team dynamic as seen on the show is not very strong here. Ryu is not quite the big, loveable giant, Joe is not quite the angry, aggressive #2 as he was on the anime and Ken is more of a stereotypical tormented hero. Ken and Joe share a love interest which is NOT Jun, which further makes it weird. The less said about Berg Katse, the better.

But, lots of action, the FX are decent, although I thought some of the suits looked bad (Ken in particular had all the wrong colors). So.. worth a watch if you are a fan but as a fan myself, I can't say this was much more than mediocre and kind of disappointing.",1404604800,11,1275,4.398305084745763
6338225,4,B00J806VWY,"Phew... okay, um, I'm going to lead my review off by saying that this is NOT the best anime to live action flick ever made.  I am going to say that it earned a four star rating based on nostalgia alone.  The story is pretty standard, and the over dramatic emotional outbursts (seriously, come on, Japan...) kinda bog it down.

But it's friggin G-Force, man!  I was a nut for this show when I was a kid, complete with running around the backyard with a towel over my shoulders (sorry, Mom) and making whooshing sounds.  Worth a look, if you're a hardcore fan of the pre-Voltron classics.",1404432000,2,586,4.4392523364485985

6338227,3,B00J806VWY,"I've always wondered what GATCHAMAN was about.  I've never really followed the cartoon series.  I thought I'd take a chance on the modern live movie.  Bottom line nice story but I truly feel that if I was a real fan, I would have been sorely disappointed.  I can tell.",1403654400,,268,4.408163265306122
6338228,2,B00J806VWY,"So Battle of the Planets/G-Force/Gatchaman was an old favorite from my childhood.  So I was pretty pumped to hear about a live action version and snapped up this DVD, a copy of the Malaysian version with English subtitles.

And yeah it was a nice try, but it was a major disappointment.

The FX are very cheap, other than the first battle there's nothing here you won't see in a Power Rangers episode and even that first battle has some major problems.  The Gatchaman team bounce from building to building like parkour traceurs on speed, but the animators just aren't up to the job, the figures shift sizes and perspective in impossible ways that destroy suspension of disbelief.

After that initial battle the movie grinds to a halt with the team lounging around in ugly jumpsuits and having endless flashbacks until we get to the climax.  For some odd reason the producers thought that what we really want in a Gatchaman movie is an indepth exportation of the characters, their motivations and doubts, rather than Science Ninjas kick butt.  But I suppose it's a way to keep the effects budget down.

Then we get to the final battle but even that's nothing we've not seen a thousand times before with karate fights among cheap sets.

Dr Nambu gets some special praise, he looks like he just got off the bus from 1970 and is most authentic looking character in the film.

The subtitles are good for a laugh or two, done by someone with an arms-length relationship with the English language.  The character Joe for example is called Joe in Japanese, his name even pops up in some English text.  But it's translated throughout as George.

But honestly even a better translation wouldn't make this mediocre adaptation worth watching.

I'd recommend picking up the original anime and giving this a miss.",1403308800,12,1799,4.7612903225806456

My only gripe was at times the subtitles were really hard to understand, which for me makes movies I have to read more taxing. But There is no news when this movie will get a US release so any fan that wants to see this movie as bad as I did this is small and rather trivial problem.

  I was so disappointed when the anime movie was dropped. When the live action movie premiered in Japan I looked up the cost of air fare, I was so excited about seeing it! I didn't get to see it in theaters but the blueray I managed to aquire is fantastic! Ive watched it every night for the last two weeks but I really wanted to understand what they were saying other than arigato, kso and Baka so I had to have this one even if it is confusingly subtitled in some scenes.

6338238,3,B00J806VWY,"Unlike most American fans, I consider 'Battle of the Planets' and 'G Force' as a monumental waste of time.  I loved Gatchaman, Gatchaman II, and Gatchaman F(ighter), and see no reason why they had to be chopped, channeled, badly dubbed, and twisted into Americanese in order to make them more accessible to their viewership.  'Battle' went one step lower, by adding totally out of place and extraneous animation (if you can call it that) plus an obligatory 'cute' robot to dumb down the proceedings and explain what's already been quite adequately explained, thank you, and fill up time lost from hacking out scenes of violence and more mature situations that they figured poor little sensitive American kiddies couldn't handle..
Therefore, my review is of the live action version of the anime series that I loved.  Considering that 'Jet Man' went down pretty much the same road about twenty years ago, not bad.  The actors weren't painful, and the special effects were decent.  All in all, though, I think I'll just plug in my ancient videotapes and watch the real thing.",1399766400,,1072,4.933333333333334
6338239,3,B00J806VWY,"One of my earliest childhood memories was watching the Americanized version of the Japanese-import cartoon GATCHAMAN, known here in the States as BATTLE OF THE PLANETS. It's a cool premise and a fun show, with five ""fearless young orphans defending the Earth's entire galaxy"" from alien threats. I was obsessed with the show because my very young eyes had never seen anything quite like it. But that was the late 70's. Since then, the show had gone through a really awful Americanization in the early 90's simply called G-FORCE that aired on the Cartoon Network. But back in Japan in the mid-90's, it was being given a much better anime treatment, going back to the original name GATCHAMAN, with the same characters, but with not only superior animation but far better storytelling as well. Still riding on the nostalgia popularity of the show, the Japanese studio Nikkatsu finally released, after years of development hell, a live-action feature film based on the successful cartoon. And while GATCHAMAN delivers a good deal of fan service and some really terrific CG effects, the end result is pretty far from what we'd hoped from years of waiting.

The film plays around with the concepts and the origins of the major characters we know and love from the series, and finally deigns to give us an explanation into how the Science Ninja Team Gatchaman got their abilities. There's a maguffin called the G-Element that is used by the members of Gatchaman: Ken (the leader), Joe (the angry 2nd-in-command), Jun (the girl), Ryu (the bruiser), and Jinpei (the kid) all have the G-Element running through their battle suits to give them flight capabilities and superhuman strength. And then there's the leader of the Galactor, the alien race that looks to enslave the world, who they capture and bring to their base at the International Science Organization. He pulls a Joker/Khan/Loki and escapes, but not before a big reveal that has some surprising emotional heft to it. Then we get killer satellites, a floating island fortress, and the appearence of the most awesome tech the show ever created, which is Gatchaman's ship, the Firey Phoenix.

The opening of the film is very impressive. To see the team flying around the streets of Tokyo battling the forces of the Galactor, using the iconic moves and weapons they're known for is easily the high-point of the film. There isn't really a moment of that opening that looks any lesser than a big-budget American comic-book film. Several squees from my inner child were let out during those moments. The character development, particularly that of Ken and Joe, is well-handled. However, whatever currency is spent in the first act is almost depleted in an incredibly sluggish second act that, while having a really cool reveal, is such a snooze and really deflates any sense of urgency to the film. The third act of the film is enough to save it from being a total bore, but just enough. If a film like G.I. JOE: RETALIATION knew enough to have a really cool second-act action sequence, it seems like any action filmmaker should know this as an axiom. So, it essentially suffers from the same problem as many of the Toho GODZILLA films; it has a big opening and a pretty cool ending, but there's too much downtime.

GATCHAMAN is a fun film that will bring back lots of cool childhood memories particularly in the first act, but after that, it's all pretty much downhill.",1398643200,14,3416,4.855917667238422

I loved it the first time I saw it and I finally got smart enough to check Amazon and wow I found it . It's just an awesome movie . It steers in a different direction than the anime cartoon but I feel that's what made it more interesting to me . It just made it feel like a totally different movie from the anime .,1459382400,2,408,3.755813953488372
8648656,5,B00J806VWY,I just love this movie that that I could not wait to get it and watch it and I got one for a friend of mine,1453593600,,107,3.1538461538461537
8648657,3,B00J806VWY,"They changed A LOT!  Don't expect a live action version of the cartoon.  it is a bit boring at times, but there is still some terrific action and special effects!  Just keep an open mind.",1452816000,,187,4.285714285714286
8648658,4,B00J806VWY,Captioning was either weak or too literal. Sometimes...this stuff just doesn't translate well. But I'm too much of an old school G-Force (Battle Of The Planets) guy to care. I still love it!,1451433600,,190,4.787878787878788
8648659,2,B00J806VWY,"I'm a huge fan of the original Gatchaman anime and was very excited to see this live-action adaptation. Sadly, I was very disappointed. As I was watching, I felt as if the director, producer, and writers, have never seen a single episode of Gatchaman. The characters are not true to the original, especially the story's nemesis, Berg Katse, who was a complete disaster in character translation. The actors and actresses they chose to play the parts are hokey and lack any kind of charisma. The whole movie plays off as if you're watching Power Rangers or Mortal Combat. If you've never seen any of the original Gatchaman anime (or Battle of the Planets) then you might like this movie. Otherwise, someone seriously needs to remake this to a more accurate account of the original anime.",1437436800,4,785,4.822222222222222
8648660,4,B00J806VWY,was not in English but had it not been for good special effects I would not of care to much for it,1435881600,,98,3.5
8648661,5,B00J806VWY,Different the old anime but just a great kids movie.  I recommend it to one and all,1435363200,,83,3.8823529411764706
