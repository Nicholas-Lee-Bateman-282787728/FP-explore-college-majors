6195917,5,B00HPZQBIS,Very well done and it was a nice interview job by Dr. Moody. It was an in depth telling of the events.,1410393600,,102,3.6818181818181817

""alarmingly unscientific,"" and that ""everything  absolutely everything  in Alexander's account rests on repeated assertions that his visions of heaven occurred while his cerebral cortex was 'shut down,' 'inactivated,' 'completely shut down,' 'totally offline,' and 'stunned to complete inactivity.' The evidence he provides for this claim is not only inadequate  it suggests that he doesn't know anything about the relevant brain science.",1410048000,9,522,5.828947368421052
6195920,4,B00HPZQBIS,"I always love hearing people speak of heaven, but it's sad that this Doctor needed to die to prove there is a heaven. Christ told us all this clearly 2000 years ago. ""Proof of Heaven"" is only part of it though, and not the most amazing part, as everyone will die and go to the other side, but understanding and developing a personal relationship with Christ, the creator, our God and the greatest scientist and mathematician who ever lived is the better and more valuable conversation and becoming like him, the most valuable and rewarding endeavor.",1409529600,,549,4.729166666666667
6195921,5,B00HPZQBIS,"A most incredible topic!
2 MDs discussing the afterlife.
One of them, a neurosurgeon, is relating his own experience of the afterlife.

6195922,5,B00HPZQBIS,Eben Alexander and Raymond Moody look at Eben's NDE from a scientific perspective.  Eben goes more into the discoveries he made than is in his book.  I highly recommend this.,1399852800,18,174,4.766666666666667
6195923,4,B00HPZQBIS,"Main draw back was that Dr. Raymond Moody, who did the interviewing, did not do a very good job of interviewing and couldn't resist talking about what he had concluded from interviewing others on the topic of their Near Death Experiences.  Dr. Alexander is very articulate and does a good job of relating his experience of Heaven. But, when he started talking about multi-dimensional, eternal, endless universes (plural), my brain got tied in knots.  I've also heard Dr. Alexander live and he is a very personable fellow.  I had hoped to learn more of how his experience had impacted his church attendance, since before the coma, he was ""one step above a C & E (Christmas & Easter only) Christian.  He does mention one very meaningful experience attending church with his wife after his return and lighting the advent calendar and taking communion.  I believe he attends the Episcopal church.  He does not talk about meeting or seeing Jesus, but does say that he was in God's (Om's) presence and was one with Him and was taught many things, chief among them is that love is the basis of everything in this world and the next and that science and spirituality can co-exist, and, in fact, must.  He is on a mission to bring that belief to the medical science community and anyone else who doubts there is life after death and realms beyond the one we live in that is bounded by space and time.",1398988800,70,1391,4.630081300813008
6195924,5,B00HPZQBIS,This was a very well done documentary and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would recommend this to anybody that is interested in these kind of topics.,1394582400,18,145,4.576923076923077

6195929,4,B00HPZQBIS,Arrived quickly after order very secure packaging and as stated brand new!  I was screening this DVD as a possible view for a group I was conducting as I had seen Dr. Alexander in person and found him interesting.  The DVD is not suitable for my group as it is just too long and Dr. Moody's presence is an unecessary distraction to Eben's momentum in telling his story and added nothing to the format .  For group showings the length and format would make it hard to keep their interest..  I think we will group study Ebens's book instead.,1461974400,,539,4.414141414141414

The author is a neurosurgeon - he's studied brain activitiy and seen into the brain all his adult life. Although it's hard for me to accept everything he concludes, it has opened my mind. Definitely worth reading and would make a good book club book.",1457654400,,346,4.421875

6195933,5,B00HPZQBIS,"I love his experience. I'd seen him on, Beyond and Back, so I wanted to see what else he had to say.
He shares his story and experience, and how he met someone he never met, or knew on the other side, confirming he wasn't making it up when he got confirmation regarding the person he never met, who was with him the whole time on the other side.

His experience with the angel's singing, how there were infinite, and basically how their voices vibrated. How he felt it, is what I experienced, except I didn't die, it was an experience I had w/o meditating about 20 years ago. He took me there once more with his description.",1454198400,7,624,4.288135593220339

6195941,5,B00HPZQBIS,"A wonderful discussion between Dr's Alexander and Moody! They presented very powerful and convincing evidence of the afterlife and the near death phenomenon. I also enjoyed watching the interview with Dr. Alexander's wife Holly, and hearing her views on her husband's experience. Very well presented!",1443830400,4,300,5.688888888888889
6195942,5,B00HPZQBIS,"Excellent and informative video further explaining Dr Alexander's amazing NDE.

6195947,4,B00HPZQBIS,"This really isn't a ""movie"", so-to-speak, just my opinion, anyway. It's good, to be clear, but it's more like, listening to an author, tell of his experience while in a coma, or the writings in his book, per-say. It is quite compelling! I just expected, I guess, for it to have been illustrated into a movie. Had I known that, before purchasing it, I would have known what to expect? Then, I probably would have rated this with 5 stars.",1440979200,,436,4.4625
6195948,3,B00HPZQBIS,"Dr. Alexander's answers and comments were succinct and very understandable.  The reason I can not give this disc a 5 is because the disc needs ""cleaning"" up.  For example, Dr. Moody's questions were not loud enough to hear unless we turned the sound way up when he talked and then Alexander's answers were too loud.  Seems the microphone Dr. Moody did not have on a microphone.  I would like to have a remake (edit) of this disc or a copy of the book if it is available.  In fact, I thought I WAS buying a book.",1440806400,,511,4.28125
6195949,5,B00HPZQBIS,"This is the most definitive book I have ever read. The Doctor's story is fascinating as well as entirely imaginative in describing his profound view of the afterlife,or beginnings thereof , that I do not need anymore convincing. As a firm believer in Christian Spiritually I have ""been on the fence"" about a visual view of the afterlife my God has in store for me,even after reading so many near death and death experiences books, Eben's book is the final book I will probably read on his subject. Thank you Dr. Alexander and I am so grateful God has blessed you with the ability to do His Will by writing such a Masterpiece. I will be forever grateful to God for leading me to your wonderful book. I Love you brother,Charles Stevens",1440115200,,733,4.5606060606060606

6195952,5,B00HPZQBIS,I read the book so I wasn't sure what more I would get from watching this interview. It was wonderful and I felt drawn into it. I began to understand the importance of Dr. Alexander's experience as a message for the rest of us rather than it just being an interesting story. I think everyone should at least consider the possibilities presented in this film.,1437868800,4,358,4.523076923076923

6195958,3,B00HPZQBIS,"The Dr. is kind of weird, he makes all kinds of distracting faces. But...its a good story and it is true that his experience has been had by very many people who do not know each other. It is a common thing for hospital people to hear about and remarkable how similar the stories are from one person to another. I read A LOT of after life and medium type books and there really is a common thread in all of the stories in the world. I had read Mr. Moody's book ages ago, and his book was fascinating to me and actually sent me on my journey to find out what is really Out There.

6195960,3,B00HPZQBIS,"I loved the books and videos with Dr. Alexander. His message is terrific. This meditation experience is quite good, but the voice work by the woman is very distracting. For me, her tone is robotic and not at all conducive to the meditation process. Eben Alexander's explanations are excellent, so I wish he had done the meditation processes himself, as well. With a better vocal for the induction process, this would definitely be a 5-star review.",1431907200,,447,4.894736842105263
6195961,1,B00HPZQBIS,"This guy is an MD, but he doesn't know anything about brain science. When your brain wakes up from a dormant state, it can create false memories. That's clearly what happened here. His ""memories"" are really his brain making things up in such a way that he believes that he ""remembers"" them. It hard for anybody to not believe what their memory is telling them, but false memories are well documented. Eye witness accounts of a crime are notoriously unreliable, because people who saw the same thing have different memories. Many years ago, many people were falsely accused of child molestation because vivid memories of something that never happened were implanted in people's minds during therapy.

We all want to believe what he's saying, of course. Who wants to die? He's been duped by his own brain, though.",1431820800,3,811,4.8768115942028984
6195962,5,B00HPZQBIS,"Interviewed by Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Eben Alexander gives what Dr. Moody calls the most intriguing account of a near death experience he's heard in over 50 years of research. This film in foundational to anyone studying near-death or out-of-body experiences, and touches on the importance of quantum mechanics and spirituality with science. Science alone can not give us all the answers we need. This film opened-up an entirely new way of thinking for me.

One part of me is convinced they are on to something, and another more skeptical part thinks perhaps Eben may have cooked up the story, or embellished it, for the sake of starting a second career, using his credentials and intelligence to win people over. You have to take him at his word that he experienced the things he did while in coma: if you do, then the argument is significant that he had such detailed experiences while the parts of his brain that are supposed to be responsible for such experiences was shut down. Maybe it's explained in his book, but I would have liked to ask him why he thinks these experiences weren't produced by his brain when it was on its way out of coma, right before he woke up: I've had dreams that where it seemed like years passed, when in real time it was only half and hour . . . Anyway, I'm attempting to put these doubts aside and just believe, based on the conviction of these men and others, and on my own experiences of odd and meaningful synchronicities and powerful dreams that echo some of NDE images and themes.

6195998,3,B00HPZQBIS,"Vivid dream or reality? Eben mentions being on a butterfly wing, plants, flowers opening, people and people's faces saying prayers. This, of course, we could all relate to, in our earthly realm, but in the other side why would it be like this instead of unlimited spiritual entities. Would there be blue skies or other worldly physicality? Do spirits need bodies and faces? Is there male and females on the other side, what would be the point? Would one need to be transported by a butterfly or just beamed to where you need or want to be. He determined the female, on the butterfly with him, was his biological sister who passed previously but says nothing to him but transfers her thoughts but not that she is her sister.

The Divine entity light is common for NDE, however, the only teaching from the Devine he mentions is the 'world going to go through a consciousness transformation'. This is not uncommon from other spiritual sources, however, is it, or can it be, a reality globally? How would it occur what about Free Will, will it vacate the scene?

Edben mentions, I, for me, etc. about His beliefs not mentioning where these came from i.e. Divine Teachings? His beliefs mentioned are not singular from his NDE but from other known, spiritual beliefs as well. This doesn't, however, mean they are not from the Divine or untrue.

Edben doesn't mention, in this documentary, what teachings he had from the Divine or other entities in the other side, which, for me, is what I am, and I am sure others are, most interested in.

He discusses consciousness multiple lengthy times (from the Divine?) but not that this is his own belief or what the Divine taught him? Perhaps he goes over Divine Teachings in his book. Consciousness readings and discussion are abundant in this realm.

Music, love. I believe are manifested in the earthly realm from the divine realm which he mentions which is interesting but nothing really new. Eben's discussions, to me, are interesting of spiritual value but are they from a vivid dream, previous readings or from the Divine realm.",1414886400,2,2070,4.770949720670391

6196001,5,B00HPZQBIS,"I've been reading a lot of books on reincarnation and near death experiences, and then have moved to books about consciousness being beyond our brain in our skull.  Some of the consciousness-related books go deeply into philosophy and physics.  Listening to Dr. Moody's and Dr. Alexander's discussion, it becomes evident that both are well-read on consciousness.  Dr. Moody has focused on philosophy and Dr. Alexander has focused more on physics.

Most people are getting a better understanding of the continuation of consciousness beyond death based on the commonality of the many experiences being shared at this time in multiple books, dvds, and interviews.  That so many people have had somewhat similar near death experiences can be proof enough for some.

But, to listen to these two scientifically-educated men who have delved deeply into ancient, classic, and current scientific literature to seek a better understanding of the greater consciousness experience is a real treat.

There is a bit of discussion about the rough transition that is happening now as mainstream Science and Spirituality are meeting at some points.  Like a Venn Diagram of two intersecting circles, there is an intersection where they meet, and that common area is growing, but not without some pain and attacks.  Consciousness is firmly in that intersection.

The bonus portion of the dvd, where Holley Alexander is interviewed, is delightful and is somewhat indicative of the life changes that happened after Dr. Alexander's near death experience, if only to consider the different kind of people that came into their lives as he became a message bearer.

I can see that this dvd may not be for everyone.  The discussion of Consciousness is deep and may not be of interest to people who mostly enjoy hearing about the various cases of NDE shared in many books or documentaries.  But for people interested in science or philosophy there is a lot of food for thought.  At least there is great pleasure in listening to two intelligent and well-read men discussing a topic they are both passionate about.  That's an experience I'm not privy to in regular life.",1413676800,50,2141,5.0945558739255015
6196002,5,B00HPZQBIS,"I am familiar with Raymond Moody's work and have read a couple of books by authors who experienced an NDE, yet, Eben Alexander's experience stands out for me. I am now TRULY convinced NDEs are real after listening to Dr. Alexander's intelligent approach in processing his NDE. I like that he didn't make his experience a religious one but a universal spiritual experience.

I also enjoyed Dr. Moody's interviewing style; he hardly interrupted but offered his insights for consideration and this enhanced the interview.",1413158400,24,518,5.166666666666667
6196003,5,B00HPZQBIS,Isn'tulate! The expression of his experience echoes the experiences of David R Hawkins and resonates with Course in Miracles. One more beautiful expression of non dualism.

8634139,5,B00HPZQBIS,After reading Proof of Heaven this video brought to life the man who made the journey. Both proof of heaven and map of heaven by this author enhance the knowledge he learned form his journey. To get to see him speak of it in the first person was both moving and reassuring that what we adopted from his books for our own peace was going to last us a lifetime.,1488931200,,359,4.142857142857143

8634141,5,B00HPZQBIS,"I have never had a NDE, but I have had other experiences that taught me many of the same lessons.  I also have a scientific background, but there is so much hard science cannot explain.  That is the elephant in the room, yet most people block the non-empirical and concrete ""knowledge"" they acquire.  I agree with Dr. Alexander that this is often the most important thing we can learn during our lives here.  I also have come to know that love is the most important thing we are to learn and share, and that love has to be the under-current to everything we do.  If everyone knew these things, the Earth and our society would be transformed.  Thank you, Dr. Alexander, for your work in this area and for your bravery to share it.",1476403200,,729,4.402985074626866
