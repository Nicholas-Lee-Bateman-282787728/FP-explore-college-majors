8446108,5,B004X63S1A,"If you are already a fan of Less Than Jake, then you already know that this dvd set is going to be amazing. The fact that these guys rock so hard and went night after night to play their albums in entirety is amazing. I only wish they would come out with additions. Give us the newer albums from to back. And I don't care what anyone says. In with the out crowd is a great album.",1474070400,,379,3.935064935064935

8446111,5,B004X63S1A,"Less Than Jake are incredible. While most band's get by just playing the same 15-20 songs over and over, with a couple of changes each tour, and ignoring golden albums tracks, Less Than Jake took the time to learn 6 albums worth of material, plus b-sides and rarities. They then played each album in it's entirety over 6 nights in Florida in 2007. They claim to have learn about 109 songs, which is an amazing effort, and treat for fans with close connections to specific albums and obscure tracks.

This DVD is a must have for LTJ fans, featuring albums from Pezcore to In With The Out Crowd. All performances are energetic and exciting, with hilarious banter between songs. Chris is particularly gifted in abusing his own band and writing off certain albums, even though the fans love them. (He bad mouth's IWTOC at pretty much every show). A couple of treats on the DVD are bonus tracks after a whole album has been played, including Less Than Jake Karaoke (where fans get to 'sing' songs) and one lucky guy got to play Liquor Store on guitar.

Along with the 6 album performances, is a compilation disc of live footage from shows ranging from 1995 to 2010. It's amazing seeing how they progressed as a band, and it seems they used to have a lot more energy. There is some great footage from Warped Tour over the years, a Japan tour, and my favourite was what looked like a backyard show, with 40 people crowding the stage so you can't even see the band, all shouting out 'Jen Doesn't Like Me Anymore'.

Seriously buy this DVD! It is such good value and makes you want to start a ska punk band.",1318291200,,1597,4.481099656357388
8446112,5,B004X63S1A,"I've enjoyed every Less than Jake album I've heard, and I've enjoyed them a few times live before, so I thought I would check this out. I was a little worried that the sound wouldn't be very good, but I was surprised to find out the sound is awesome. It sounds studio quality, but you can tell it's just strait audio from the live recording.  The directing of the video is great also, focusing on the main instrumentation or vocalization during that particular part of the song.  Less than Jake themselves are awesome as usual live, playing with perfection, fervor, and pride. Their stage banter is almost always amusing, and doesn't feel like it gets in the way of the music.

Unlike the reissues of their albums that come with a DVD of live footage of each song from different concerts, this DVD shows each album played strait through from front to back at several shows they played in 2007. There is no fade-out/fade-in between songs; they show the entire album from front to back.  Each album concert has a few extra songs thrown in at the end (these ones are edited in, however); mainly b-sides and cover songs.

As a Less than Jake fan, I love this anthology. I just wish they would have included their most recent album, GNV FLA.",1309305600,4,1236,4.54954954954955
