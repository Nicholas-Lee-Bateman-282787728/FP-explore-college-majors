3101363,5,B00132D7Y0,"I really enjoyed the movie ""Man in the Wilderness"" when it first came out. Finally it's on dvd. Good quality. Highly recommend. The other movie encluded is so, so, but watchable.",1225324800,2,178,4.774193548387097
3101364,5,B00132D7Y0,"This movie was made back in the days when stupid non realistic John Wayne type westerns were made. Instead this movie was a cutting edge realistic movie of its time that has gone unrecognized for its greatness. Bits and pieces of this movie could be used in a documentary about the real early pioneers of the west. The detail is amazing.  The story I understand is fictional but amazing non the less.

What I like about the movie most of all is that it has a Christian base. Catholics as well as Protestants will understand this movie from this angle.

From a Christian perspective the movie is about a man who was brought up in a mixed Christian world. His teachers were cruel and forced God on him without a sense of God's love. He lost his parents at an early age and was forced to live a hard life with men who probably did not know God's love.

He was reintroduced to God by his good wife who was so filled with Faith, Hope, and Love.

When he was left to die in the wilderness after being mauled by a bear, his hard upbringing wanted revenge. As he recovered from his near death injuries he reflected back on his religious upbringing and his good wife. He read the bible in his lonely nights and he began to realize more and more that he did not want revenge but only to just go back home. When he caught up with the men who left him to die, he forgave them without words and just went home. No shoot em up hollywood corn ball ending, but a great and realistic and very powerful ending.

What a great movie it has something for everyone.  On the back cover of the Video verson it was billed as a story of revenge.  It is a great deal more than that.",1223337600,3,1655,4.215189873417722
3101365,4,B00132D7Y0,"Man in the Wilderness is a neglected and underrated film, only now released, and little short of a masterpiece. Beautiful cinematography and good direction are at its center. Superb meditative images lead one into the thoughts of a trapper critically wounded by a bear and abandoned by the trapping company he was a part of. Flashbacks acquaint us with the trapper's youth and young manhood, and frame and complement his actions in the story's present. If it has a fault it would be the ending, which seemss a bit too neat, but it must be allowed that it is carefully prepared for, and the direction is otherwise very sure. This ranks with Ridley Scott's ""The Duelists"" as one of the most beautifully photographed films of its period. I had truly despaired of its ever being released, and to me, this issue is a cause for celebration.",1219881600,5,834,4.719178082191781
3101366,5,B00132D7Y0,"I recall the first time I ever saw MAN IN THE WILDERNESS. I had stayed up late to watch the weekly feature on the local station's weekly Western. And there it was, MAN IN THE WILDERNESS, a tale about a mountain man who is left for dead after a brutal grizzly mauling and not only lives to carry on but finds his real life in the process.

First, throw away any misconceptions that this is a historical account. Yes, there are fictionalizations of historical characters. Zach Bass, himself, is loosely based on Hugh Glass. But who cares? The drama here, the sweeping panoramas, the gritty cinematography combine to offer a movie experience the likes of which are just not available anymore.

Richard Harris stars as Zach Bass, a stowaway who became a mountain man, thrust into the West during the 1820's. His mentor, Captain Henry, played masterfully by the inimitable John Huston--one of Hollywood's greatest legends--a man demonized by his past on the sea while being locked within mountains and valleys and pursued by Indians. After leaving Bass for dead, his crazed mind adds Bass's specter to his tormenters.

In the end, this one is a classic tale of obsession, of survival, of priorities and of forgiveness, all set in the rugged grandeur of the frontier. An absolute Western classic.

And, as this DVD is a double feature, forget about the flipside of this one and stick with MAN IN THE WILDERNESS.

THE HORSEMAN",1215302400,26,1419,4.799180327868853
3101367,5,B00132D7Y0,"""MAN IN THE WILDERNESS"" has always been a personal favorite of mine since its release back in 1971. Historical inaccuracies aside, this is a story about a man who is left for dead in the northwest territory, but...more than that, it is the story of man lost inside himself. In his fight to survive he learns a little more about the hard cruel world around him and comes to appreciate that he is not the only human being to have suffered. His near death experience becomes (in the end) a sort of rebirth...a renwal of spirit and hope which, until the mauling, was a complete mystery to him. The images and music in this production have always touched and impressed me. It is not typical of the usual formulaic bilge Hollywood cranks out...and for that you will be grateful. This is a motion picture well worth your time and money. The actors do a fine job in all their portrayals and it is fun to see James Doohan, John Huston and Percy Herbert in their supporting rolls. For me this is one of Richard Harris's finest performances...better even than ""A MAN CALLED HORSE"". Richard Sarafian (the director of credit) had a small part in the Wachowski Brothers ""BOUND"" (1996) as a mob boss.
As for the DVD quality, it looks fine considering the time the movie was made and the no frills approach to this release. The print is far better than that of the VHS and is finally shown in the proper aspect ratio. The sound is monoural and the dialog a tad shrill in parts, but that is how I remember it...even in the theatrical release, which I went to see many times.
As for ""THE DEADLY TRACKERS""...it is generally a waste of time. It is a sloppily made and heavy handed film of vengence that yields little (if any) satisfaction by story's end.
Whatever you pay for this release will be money well spent for ""MAN IN THE WILDERNESS"" alone. *** ENJOY ***",1212537600,56,1842,4.4851190476190474
3101368,3,B00132D7Y0,"DEADLY TRACKERS is a violent tale of revenge as Richard Harris pursues Rod Taylor and his band of killers after a botched bank robbery results in the death of his wife and son.  Taylor is fine as a really bad guy and in a small part, B-Movie Legend William Smith as one of his men, ""School-Boy"" -- a violent semi-retard with one side of his face scarred and a drooping eye who kills a man with a knife to take his bowler. They just don't make appealing characters like anymore! Unfortunately, the Billster is killed early on and the film looses all appeal for me.  MAN IN THE WILDERNESS is the better of the two, based on mountain man Hugh Glass, who was attacked by a grizzly and left for dead by his companions.  They should have made sure he really was dead!",1212105600,6,761,4.3076923076923075
3101369,3,B00132D7Y0,"I have waited a long time for MAN IN THE WILDERNESS to be released on dvd. Originally released in 1971,there is a rough edge,seventies ambience about the film that modern films,even westerns, sadly lack. The film
follows the ordeal of one Zachary Bass(Richard Harris),after he is attacked by a bear and left for dead by Captain Henry(John Huston)and
a motley crew of trappers and traders hellbent on getting back home
before Winter seals them in. Set in the early 1800's,it is more colonial than western, but regardless of any label,it is a film worth watching
on the strength of Harris' performance alone. There is not a lot of
dialogue and that is one of the movie's strengths. The spectacle of an old wooden ship being hauled on the frozen tundra on wooden wheels by men and
mules is a sight to behold. No CGI here,folks. Richard Harris became
somewhat of an offbeat western cult hero with this movie and A MAN CALLED HORSE and it culminated with the role of English Bob in UNFORGIVEN. He
always played an Irishman or Englishman so he was true to his origins.
The other movie on this double feature dvd is THE DEADLY TRACKERS.Made in
1973,it fails in comparison to MAN IN THE WILDERNESS. The lore is that
Samuel Fuller was the original choice to direct this film,but clashes
with Harris forced him out. With a supporting cast that included
Al Lettieri (his last film),William Smith,Neville Brand,Paul Benjamin
and Rod Taylor,you would think this film would be a lot better than it is. Taylor,in the role of a ruthless killer, actually plays against type
and does a damn fine job. This movie seems to be aimed toward the hippy stoner crowd circa 1973. There is even a psychedelic sequence when Harris loses his sight complete with trippy colors. The movie even tries its hand at being ""hip & relavent"" with a lot of moral posturing when Harris and Taylor finally have their showdown. Even Isela Vega(BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA) doesn't lift the movie up from its unintentional heavy
handedness. For some reason,this movie ""stole"" a lot of the soundtrack/music from Jerry Fielding's score from THE WILD BUNCH .That's why it rates two stars. MAN IN THE WILDERNESS gets four stars.",1211932800,9,2189,4.778364116094987
3101370,1,B00132D7Y0,I HAVE  N E V E R  R E C E I V E D  THIS  DVD and  I am  V E R Y  U P S E T  ABOUT IT ! ! ! !,1474070400,,93,1.457142857142857
3101371,4,B00132D7Y0,"OK, let's dispense with ""Deadly Trackers"" first - a very poor excuse for a Western, a grade ""F"" film which I posted a separate review for. Also has very poor video quality in addition to its very poor plot, poor characters, and poorer acting.

Let's look at ""Man in the Wilderness"" next which is actually a  pretty good 'survivalist' movie, though not without its flaws. I found John Houston's  dour acting as the expedition's mono-focused even more dour captain unexplained. Did he think he was Captain Ahab?  The part of the plot about transporting a keelboat loaded with animal pelts across vast stretches of land in 1820 makes absolutely no sense. Were there roads in the very remote West to allow this? Not hardly. Usually one would portage a boat around natural obstacles like waterfalls, apparently this heavy boat was just trying to find the big river via a road march - a significant plot hole. The one refreshing thing I noted was Henry Wilcoxon's portrait of the blue-eyed older refined Indian. Henry was an old time Hollywood actor who once played Marc Anthony in DeMille's 1935 movie ""Cleopatra"", so he'd been around the block for about 40 years before he made this Western. Too bad his native language ramblings were not subtitled or translated on screen, they would have been interesting. Richard Harris was pretty believable as the bear-injured man who does what he can to survive. It compares favorably with 2015's ""The Revenant"", though ""the Revenant"" is much more polished and detailed and incredibly photographed. This was a very watchable and interesting and entertaining movie.",1468886400,,1599,4.977528089887641

3101387,5,B00132D7Y0,"I bought this for Man in the Wilderness alone, as it is the only decent release I know of for this outstanding film. It followed up A Man Called Horse in exploring the white man in the early 19th century Northwest. The ""wilderness"" Zach Bass experiences is one of both physical and spiritual. The cinematography is ethereal in it's landscapes. You really feel the cold and wet that Bass must endure. Adding to the beauty is the haunting and majestic score to the film; I tracked this down on vinyl and it's a treasure. The casting alone is noteworthy not only in names, but they have the look of 19th century trappers. Above all, this is a thinking man's flick, something in real shortage now. Hopefully with all the hubbub over Revenant, someone might think to bring this beautiful film to bluray.",1456444800,,798,4.626760563380282

3101390,5,B00132D7Y0,"I bought this double sided DVD expresly for the movie ""The Man In The Wilderness"" starring Richard Harris. I wanted to see just how Di Caprio fared in the same role of Zach Bass, as well as compair the two movies as they went head to head with each other. Let me add that the movie ""The Man In The Widerness"" was the first movie to portray the story of 'Zachary Bass' and his role during the Capt. Henry expidition in the Northwest Territories in the early 1800's. This portrayal showed the poor character of those men, betrayal, loss of honor, and shere cowardness in the face of
unexpected dificulties.
To me DiCaprio rendered small depiction of Zach Bass as he struggled through this trek. Richard Harris protrayed the same character with so much more depth and essence of hard core spirit.
Both movies are good and bad in ther own ways attempting to lay down this true tail of that time. If you can find the older movie I'd sugest watching it before you watch the 'Renenant'",1454198400,,978,4.5

It is visually powerful with some rather interesting views of the horse drawn boat. The personal trial of Zachary Bass and the journey it made for him was excellently portrayed. It is a classic Richard Harris Beaver skin Western. Now ""Deadly Trackers is not even close to that quality. Made by West Germans, it attempts to be a Spaghetti Western. It tries to use the blood and gore to make it Spaghetti Western but fails to tell an interesting story. It has a heavy handed moral which is neutralized by the overdone revenge story.

3101450,3,B00132D7Y0,"In the Deadly Trackers, a grade B western, a well-meaning sheriff believes that using guns against criminals and shooting them to stop them is counter-productive; it provokes revenge, retaliation, and more deaths. Four killers come to town and rob the bank. The sheriff, who had confiscated the town's guns, gives out the weapons, but tells the citizens not to shoot. Since the criminals were not stopped, they have time to kill his wife and child. The sheriff's personality changes and he chases after the killers alone into Mexico. He meets a Mexican sheriff with a similar attitude that he had before the death of his wife and child. The Mexican tries to stop him from taking revenge and killing the criminals, saying that they should be caught and tried as required by law.

 The Mexican sheriff is also after the killers for what they did in Mexico, but, unlike the American sheriff, he has no intention of shooting them on sight. Thus, the two cannot join together in the search. The Mexican sheriff is able to capture one of the killers and does not kill him. While his deputy is taking the killer to prison the criminal kills the deputy. The American sheriff turns into a wild man. He shoots the criminals who killed his wife and child when he sees them. The movie has a surprising ending.

 The film raises a serious issue: Should lawmen be idealistic and do all in their power not to harm criminals? Should they consider that such an approach may lead to people being hurt? The issue also exists in regard to sexual perverts. Science has shown that they cannot be cured. Should they be released from prison?",1291075200,3,1617,4.683098591549296

3101453,5,B00132D7Y0,"I want to state right off that I wasn't all that crazy about THE DEADLY TRACKERS. It's an okay film, but not especially great. I bought this double feature disc purely because it has MAN IN THE WILDERNESS as the second feature. That's what this review will focus on. MITW has tremendous sentimental value for me because it was the first film my father took me to see when I was a very young boy of perhaps 5 or 6. Something he rarely did. Thus, MAN IN THE WILDERNESS remains my all-time favorite Richard Harris film. MITW is a thoroughly absorbing motion picture experience, one you will enjoy IF you like seeing an individual pitted against whatever nature can throw at him, with nothing but his wits & an indomitable spirit to see him through. If you appreciate minimalist storytelling and a movie that assumes you're actually paying attention and are smart enough to figure things out for yourself without having plot details spoon-fed to you, then MAN IN THE WILDERNESS is for you. If you're already a fan of Richard Harris but don't have this movie in your library then this purchase is a no-brainer. If you know something of the man's work but have never seen either of these movies, (but most especially MAN IN THE WILDERNESS), and are curious, then do yourself a BIG favor and treat yourself to this terrific movie. 5 STARS

THE DVD: This double feature is your basic no frills offering from Warner Bros. The picture is decent and the soundmix is level & strong. Colors are bright & solid, without too much dirt or debris on the film stock to distract. The transfer holds up pretty well, with minimal artifacting & pixelation. Please note, however, that these films are contained on one of those damnable, two-sided ""flipper ""discs. It would've been so much nicer if Warner had struck a separate disc for each feature. (Truth be told though, I am thrilled beyond words just to finally have this treasured movie in my home video library.)

3101459,3,B00132D7Y0,"A vague recollection of seeing Man in the Wilderness many years ago has kept me chasing this title for the past few years. Now that I've finally seen it again I am less impressed.  I think I may have inadvertently combined this in memory with ""The Scalphunters,"" another good flick with some similarities. Man in the Wilderness is still an excellent movie and deserves perhaps more than the three stars I've allowed, on account of the other turkey that's attached to it. I say this despite the fact that I see Richard Harris as one of the great Overactors of our time, and not one of my favorites. In this movie, he says barely a word, which helps the movie tremendously. It's a survival/adventure, believable, and has a mature and interesting story line.  I particularly like the non-traditional characterizations and anti-stereotyping. They're no clear-cut good guys and bad guys, white and black hats. There's just survival, hard decisions and consequences. The movie also features a surprising, and (for its time), a very original ending.
As usual, John Huston is worth watching.
The Deadly Trackers, on the other hand, is one long clich. Another good and kind sheriff turns into a savage psychopath after watching his loved ones cruelly killed by the bad guys he's now tracking down to kill.
I'll give the first four stars, the last, one.",1225497600,4,1343,4.885964912280702

3335861,5,B00132D7Y0,"This movie was made back in the days when stupid non realistic John Wayne type westerns were made. Instead this movie was a cutting edge realistic movie of its time that has gone unrecognized for its greatness. Bits and pieces of this movie could be used in a documentary about the real early pioneers of the west. The detail is amazing.  The story I understand is fictional but amazing non the less.

What I like about the movie most of all is that it has a Christian base. Catholics as well as Protestants will understand this movie from this angle.

From a Christian perspective the movie is about a man who was brought up in a mixed Christian world. His teachers were cruel and forced God on him without a sense of God's love. He lost his parents at an early age and was forced to live a hard life with men who probably did not know God's love.

He was reintroduced to God by his good wife who was so filled with Faith, Hope, and Love.

When he was left to die in the wilderness after being mauled by a bear, his hard upbringing wanted revenge. As he recovered from his near death injuries he reflected back on his religious upbringing and his good wife. He read the bible in his lonely nights and he began to realize more and more that he did not want revenge but only to just go back home. When he caught up with the men who left him to die, he forgave them without words and just went home. No shoot em up hollywood corn ball ending, but a great and realistic and very powerful ending.

What a great movie it has something for everyone.  On the back cover of the Video verson it was billed as a story of revenge.  It is a great deal more than that.",1223337600,3,1655,4.215189873417722
3335862,4,B00132D7Y0,"Man in the Wilderness is a neglected and underrated film, only now released, and little short of a masterpiece. Beautiful cinematography and good direction are at its center. Superb meditative images lead one into the thoughts of a trapper critically wounded by a bear and abandoned by the trapping company he was a part of. Flashbacks acquaint us with the trapper's youth and young manhood, and frame and complement his actions in the story's present. If it has a fault it would be the ending, which seemss a bit too neat, but it must be allowed that it is carefully prepared for, and the direction is otherwise very sure. This ranks with Ridley Scott's ""The Duelists"" as one of the most beautifully photographed films of its period. I had truly despaired of its ever being released, and to me, this issue is a cause for celebration.",1219881600,5,834,4.719178082191781
3335863,5,B00132D7Y0,"I recall the first time I ever saw MAN IN THE WILDERNESS. I had stayed up late to watch the weekly feature on the local station's weekly Western. And there it was, MAN IN THE WILDERNESS, a tale about a mountain man who is left for dead after a brutal grizzly mauling and not only lives to carry on but finds his real life in the process.

First, throw away any misconceptions that this is a historical account. Yes, there are fictionalizations of historical characters. Zach Bass, himself, is loosely based on Hugh Glass. But who cares? The drama here, the sweeping panoramas, the gritty cinematography combine to offer a movie experience the likes of which are just not available anymore.

Richard Harris stars as Zach Bass, a stowaway who became a mountain man, thrust into the West during the 1820's. His mentor, Captain Henry, played masterfully by the inimitable John Huston--one of Hollywood's greatest legends--a man demonized by his past on the sea while being locked within mountains and valleys and pursued by Indians. After leaving Bass for dead, his crazed mind adds Bass's specter to his tormenters.

In the end, this one is a classic tale of obsession, of survival, of priorities and of forgiveness, all set in the rugged grandeur of the frontier. An absolute Western classic.

And, as this DVD is a double feature, forget about the flipside of this one and stick with MAN IN THE WILDERNESS.

THE HORSEMAN",1215302400,26,1419,4.799180327868853
3335864,5,B00132D7Y0,"""MAN IN THE WILDERNESS"" has always been a personal favorite of mine since its release back in 1971. Historical inaccuracies aside, this is a story about a man who is left for dead in the northwest territory, but...more than that, it is the story of man lost inside himself. In his fight to survive he learns a little more about the hard cruel world around him and comes to appreciate that he is not the only human being to have suffered. His near death experience becomes (in the end) a sort of rebirth...a renwal of spirit and hope which, until the mauling, was a complete mystery to him. The images and music in this production have always touched and impressed me. It is not typical of the usual formulaic bilge Hollywood cranks out...and for that you will be grateful. This is a motion picture well worth your time and money. The actors do a fine job in all their portrayals and it is fun to see James Doohan, John Huston and Percy Herbert in their supporting rolls. For me this is one of Richard Harris's finest performances...better even than ""A MAN CALLED HORSE"". Richard Sarafian (the director of credit) had a small part in the Wachowski Brothers ""BOUND"" (1996) as a mob boss.
As for the DVD quality, it looks fine considering the time the movie was made and the no frills approach to this release. The print is far better than that of the VHS and is finally shown in the proper aspect ratio. The sound is monoural and the dialog a tad shrill in parts, but that is how I remember it...even in the theatrical release, which I went to see many times.
As for ""THE DEADLY TRACKERS""...it is generally a waste of time. It is a sloppily made and heavy handed film of vengence that yields little (if any) satisfaction by story's end.
Whatever you pay for this release will be money well spent for ""MAN IN THE WILDERNESS"" alone. *** ENJOY ***",1212537600,56,1842,4.4851190476190474
3335865,3,B00132D7Y0,"DEADLY TRACKERS is a violent tale of revenge as Richard Harris pursues Rod Taylor and his band of killers after a botched bank robbery results in the death of his wife and son.

They just don't make appealing characters like anymore! Unfortunately, the Billster is killed early on and the film looses all appeal for me.  MAN IN THE WILDERNESS is the better of the two, based on mountain man Hugh Glass, who was attacked by a grizzly and left for dead by his companions.  They should have made sure he really was dead!",1212105600,6,761,4.3076923076923075
3335866,3,B00132D7Y0,"I have waited a long time for MAN IN THE WILDERNESS to be released on dvd. Originally released in 1971,there is a rough edge,seventies ambience about the film that modern films,even westerns, sadly lack. The film
follows the ordeal of one Zachary Bass(Richard Harris),after he is attacked by a bear and left for dead by Captain Henry(John Huston)and
a motley crew of trappers and traders hellbent on getting back home
before Winter seals them in. Set in the early 1800's,it is more colonial than western, but regardless of any label,it is a film worth watching
on the strength of Harris' performance alone. There is not a lot of
dialogue and that is one of the movie's strengths. The spectacle of an old wooden ship being hauled on the frozen tundra on wooden wheels by men and
mules is a sight to behold. No CGI here,folks. Richard Harris became
somewhat of an offbeat western cult hero with this movie and A MAN CALLED HORSE and it culminated with the role of English Bob in UNFORGIVEN. He
always played an Irishman or Englishman so he was true to his origins.
The other movie on this double feature dvd is THE DEADLY TRACKERS.Made in
1973,it fails in comparison to MAN IN THE WILDERNESS. The lore is that
Samuel Fuller was the original choice to direct this film,but clashes
with Harris forced him out. With a supporting cast that included
Al Lettieri (his last film),William Smith,Neville Brand,Paul Benjamin
and Rod Taylor,you would think this film would be a lot better than it is. Taylor,in the role of a ruthless killer, actually plays against type
and does a damn fine job. This movie seems to be aimed toward the hippy stoner crowd circa 1973. There is even a psychedelic sequence when Harris loses his sight complete with trippy colors. The movie even tries its hand at being ""hip & relavent"" with a lot of moral posturing when Harris and Taylor finally have their showdown. Even Isela Vega(BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA) doesn't lift the movie up from its unintentional heavy
handedness. For some reason,this movie ""stole"" a lot of the soundtrack/music from Jerry Fielding's score from THE WILD BUNCH .That's why it rates two stars. MAN IN THE WILDERNESS gets four stars.",1211932800,9,2189,4.778364116094987

3335868,4,B00132D7Y0,"OK, let's dispense with ""Deadly Trackers"" first - a very poor excuse for a Western, a grade ""F"" film which I posted a separate review for. Also has very poor video quality in addition to its very poor plot, poor characters, and poorer acting.

Let's look at ""Man in the Wilderness"" next which is actually a  pretty good 'survivalist' movie, though not without its flaws. I found John Houston's  dour acting as the expedition's mono-focused even more dour captain unexplained. Did he think he was Captain Ahab?  The part of the plot about transporting a keelboat loaded with animal pelts across vast stretches of land in 1820 makes absolutely no sense. Were there roads in the very remote West to allow this? Not hardly. Usually one would portage a boat around natural obstacles like waterfalls, apparently this heavy boat was just trying to find the big river via a road march - a significant plot hole. The one refreshing thing I noted was Henry Wilcoxon's portrait of the blue-eyed older refined Indian. Henry was an old time Hollywood actor who once played Marc Anthony in DeMille's 1935 movie ""Cleopatra"", so he'd been around the block for about 40 years before he made this Western. Too bad his native language ramblings were not subtitled or translated on screen, they would have been interesting. Richard Harris was pretty believable as the bear-injured man who does what he can to survive. It compares favorably with 2015's ""The Revenant"", though ""the Revenant"" is much more polished and detailed and incredibly photographed. This was a very watchable and interesting and entertaining movie.",1468886400,,1599,4.977528089887641

3335884,5,B00132D7Y0,"I bought this for Man in the Wilderness alone, as it is the only decent release I know of for this outstanding film. It followed up A Man Called Horse in exploring the white man in the early 19th century Northwest. The ""wilderness"" Zach Bass experiences is one of both physical and spiritual. The cinematography is ethereal in it's landscapes. You really feel the cold and wet that Bass must endure. Adding to the beauty is the haunting and majestic score to the film; I tracked this down on vinyl and it's a treasure. The casting alone is noteworthy not only in names, but they have the look of 19th century trappers. Above all, this is a thinking man's flick, something in real shortage now. Hopefully with all the hubbub over Revenant, someone might think to bring this beautiful film to bluray.",1456444800,,798,4.626760563380282

3335887,5,B00132D7Y0,"I bought this double sided DVD expresly for the movie ""The Man In The Wilderness"" starring Richard Harris. I wanted to see just how Di Caprio fared in the same role of Zach Bass, as well as compair the two movies as they went head to head with each other. Let me add that the movie ""The Man In The Widerness"" was the first movie to portray the story of 'Zachary Bass' and his role during the Capt. Henry expidition in the Northwest Territories in the early 1800's. This portrayal showed the poor character of those men, betrayal, loss of honor, and shere cowardness in the face of
unexpected dificulties.
To me DiCaprio rendered small depiction of Zach Bass as he struggled through this trek. Richard Harris protrayed the same character with so much more depth and essence of hard core spirit.
Both movies are good and bad in ther own ways attempting to lay down this true tail of that time. If you can find the older movie I'd sugest watching it before you watch the 'Renenant'",1454198400,,978,4.5

It is a classic Richard Harris Beaver skin Western. Now ""Deadly Trackers is not even close to that quality. Made by West Germans, it attempts to be a Spaghetti Western.

3335947,3,B00132D7Y0,"In the Deadly Trackers, a grade B western, a well-meaning sheriff believes that using guns against criminals and shooting them to stop them is counter-productive; it provokes revenge, retaliation, and more deaths. Four killers come to town and rob the bank. The sheriff, who had confiscated the town's guns, gives out the weapons, but tells the citizens not to shoot. Since the criminals were not stopped, they have time to kill his wife and child. The sheriff's personality changes and he chases after the killers alone into Mexico. He meets a Mexican sheriff with a similar attitude that he had before the death of his wife and child. The Mexican tries to stop him from taking revenge and killing the criminals, saying that they should be caught and tried as required by law.

 The Mexican sheriff is also after the killers for what they did in Mexico, but, unlike the American sheriff, he has no intention of shooting them on sight. Thus, the two cannot join together in the search. The Mexican sheriff is able to capture one of the killers and does not kill him. While his deputy is taking the killer to prison the criminal kills the deputy. The American sheriff turns into a wild man. He shoots the criminals who killed his wife and child when he sees them. The movie has a surprising ending.

 The film raises a serious issue: Should lawmen be idealistic and do all in their power not to harm criminals? Should they consider that such an approach may lead to people being hurt? The issue also exists in regard to sexual perverts. Science has shown that they cannot be cured. Should they be released from prison?",1291075200,3,1617,4.683098591549296

3335950,5,B00132D7Y0,"I want to state right off that I wasn't all that crazy about THE DEADLY TRACKERS. It's an okay film, but not especially great. I bought this double feature disc purely because it has MAN IN THE WILDERNESS as the second feature. That's what this review will focus on. MITW has tremendous sentimental value for me because it was the first film my father took me to see when I was a very young boy of perhaps 5 or 6. Something he rarely did. Thus, MAN IN THE WILDERNESS remains my all-time favorite Richard Harris film. MITW is a thoroughly absorbing motion picture experience, one you will enjoy IF you like seeing an individual pitted against whatever nature can throw at him, with nothing but his wits & an indomitable spirit to see him through. If you appreciate minimalist storytelling and a movie that assumes you're actually paying attention and are smart enough to figure things out for yourself without having plot details spoon-fed to you, then MAN IN THE WILDERNESS is for you. If you're already a fan of Richard Harris but don't have this movie in your library then this purchase is a no-brainer. If you know something of the man's work but have never seen either of these movies, (but most especially MAN IN THE WILDERNESS), and are curious, then do yourself a BIG favor and treat yourself to this terrific movie. 5 STARS

THE DVD: This double feature is your basic no frills offering from Warner Bros. The picture is decent and the soundmix is level & strong. Colors are bright & solid, without too much dirt or debris on the film stock to distract. The transfer holds up pretty well, with minimal artifacting & pixelation. Please note, however, that these films are contained on one of those damnable, two-sided ""flipper ""discs. It would've been so much nicer if Warner had struck a separate disc for each feature. (Truth be told though, I am thrilled beyond words just to finally have this treasured movie in my home video library.)

Now that I've finally seen it again I am less impressed.  I think I may have inadvertently combined this in memory with ""The Scalphunters,"" another good flick with some similarities. Man in the Wilderness is still an excellent movie and deserves perhaps more than the three stars I've allowed, on account of the other turkey that's attached to it. I say this despite the fact that I see Richard Harris as one of the great Overactors of our time, and not one of my favorites. In this movie, he says barely a word, which helps the movie tremendously. It's a survival/adventure, believable, and has a mature and interesting story line.  I particularly like the non-traditional characterizations and anti-stereotyping. They're no clear-cut good guys and bad guys, white and black hats. There's just survival, hard decisions and consequences. The movie also features a surprising, and (for its time), a very original ending.
As usual, John Huston is worth watching.
The Deadly Trackers, on the other hand, is one long clich. Another good and kind sheriff turns into a savage psychopath after watching his loved ones cruelly killed by the bad guys he's now tracking down to kill.
I'll give the first four stars, the last, one.",1225497600,4,1343,4.885964912280702

8248816,3,B00132D7Y0,"I bought this for Man In The Wilderness.  Richard Harris plays a man who is attacked by a grizzly bear and left for dead.  It's the same story as The Revenant.  But better.  I think this is Richard Harris' best movie.  He was probably better known for A Man Called Horse and later Unforgiven but he is a surprisingly good western actor.
The Deadly Trackers just happens to be on the same dvd.  I had never seen it.  He plays a peaceful cowboy who seeks revenge after his wife and son are killed by some outlaws.  And I don't know.  Maybe it would hold up better if it was on its own dvd.  Because it just doesn't compare to Wilderness.",1486771200,,635,4.216666666666667
