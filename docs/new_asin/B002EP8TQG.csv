3918779,3,B002EP8TQG,I got this book because of the rave reviews I had read. I would recommend it. It is a good read.,1371859200,,96,3.619047619047619
3918780,5,B002EP8TQG,"Love all the loose change editions well documented and packed with all the information you need to look at 9/11 and the fact the government and people in power knew more than they let the world believe.
Every time we watch we find more information and the intrigue into what and why increases.",1369440000,,293,4.547169811320755
3918781,5,B002EP8TQG,"Was looking at the reviews to see how people were discrediting this movie, but didn't find anyone doing that. I try to get everyone to watch this. A Noble Lie too. Another good thing to get people to watch is Kennedy's speech on conspiracies. Of course, I guess that magic bullet shot by a lone gunman proved that Kennedy was wrong and there are no conspiracies.",1360022400,7,362,4.5
3918782,5,B002EP8TQG,Apparently your new found education isn't worth a damn since the video footage clearly shows what happened just with common sense despite the narrative.,1342483200,,152,5.375
3918783,5,B002EP8TQG,"Having been at the WTC site on this ""day that will live in infamy"" I wish everyone in the world would see this film, and more than once.  We have been lied to by our elected officials, the Bushes, Cheney, the CIA, the FBI, and many others for too long.  I was physically shaken by the thermite blasts that turned the Twin Towers into dust that dropped to earth at free-fall rate. I stepped over the splattered r body parts of those who had jumped from the towers as I tried to escape the carnage. I sat in my office for weeks and weeks looking out over the recovery site as the government scrambled madly, day and night, to remove the evidence before the complete shock of the day wore off the country.  I sat in my office and saw the metal - STILL MOLTEN AFTER THREE MONTHS, being scooped by backhoes into dump trucks.  For months I breathed the horrifying stench from the burning of human remains, mixed with the explosives used to pull the twin towers (and building 7 from which my company had conveniently moved just one year prior).  Hundreds and hundreds of people I see everyday witnessed the events of that day and I do not know a SINGLE ONE who believes the official crap we have been told. I thank the filmmakers for this piece.  Even if we never root out the true evildoers and bring people like George Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz et al to justice, at least I will know that the true story has been told, for all time.  We must keep confronting the atocities of that day as with each year that passes more and more is oncovered to show that we had the wool pulled over our eyes.  Pleae do your part to make sure that history does not remember these monsters with kindness, because they deserve only our despise.",1337472000,35,1745,4.3808049535603715
3918784,3,B002EP8TQG,"I have 911 Loose Change and thought it was excellent. Loose Change 2nd Edition seemed to say the same things just not as detailed. I had hoped it would bring new facts to light but it didn't. If you have a choice between the first and the second, I would recommend the first. It covered the topic very well. Not so much with the 2nd edition.",1336867200,14,341,4.181818181818182
3918785,4,B002EP8TQG,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loose-Change-2nd-Edition/dp/B002EP8TQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loose Change: 2nd Edition</a>&nbsp;When you watch the 1 1/2 hour documentary ""Loose Change, 2nd Edition ""you'll find it's time well spent. This account of the facts proving that 9/11 was an inside job is well done. My perspective on it is based on my years as an investigative reporter for Canadian industrial and military magazines. I toured the World Trade Centre towers in 1986. One of my relatives died working in the North Tower. In 2011, I met an American forensics expert who worked on the WTC clean-up. She found one of the flight recorders and recognized cordite powder used in bombs planted in the buildings in the week before 9/11. Loose Change features scientific formulae, interviews with firemen, audio and video interviews made on that day, and a superb narrative with some background music to make its point. It imprints itself on my mind and on other viewers as an important moment in 20th century history. It has only one problem--too much information and too little time in which to present it. Some printed quotes are on the screen for only 15 seconds, making freeze framing necessary to read it completely while the narrator reads it aloud. Its powerful and justified critique of  Fox News and other media coverage's  anti-Muslim and anti-intellectual stance strikes one as a key element in the film. Its a vivid demonstration of how government can use media to stifle dissent-- reminiscent of dictatorships in the 1930's and early 1940's. This an expose of how America was deceived about the truth of what happened on that September day,and how a film can reveal the facts.",1336348800,11,1731,5.336996336996337
3918786,5,B002EP8TQG,Amazing! This documentary is excellent sad to see that our own goverment was responsible for hundreds of deaths and all because of money I love my country but am ashamed for the goverment,1313625600,7,187,4.696969696969697
3918787,4,B002EP8TQG,"I am not a conspiracy theorist type of person. I don't believe all the anecdotal evidence provided in this video is worthy of a bulletproof case against the ""powers"" that be. With that said, this video should be viewed by everyone who cares about the world in which we live since the events of September 11, 2001 have done more to shape our country than any other event in recent history. If you don't want to buy the DVD you can watch the full version on YouTube.com for free.",1294185600,8,477,4.370786516853933
3918818,5,B002EP8TQG,Phenomenal video!!!!  I actually ordered it as a gift for my future Father-in-law.,1476403200,,82,5.3076923076923075
3918819,5,B002EP8TQG,Excellent documentary,1473984000,,21,10.0
3918820,5,B002EP8TQG,"The first version of Loose Change is way better than this one. For making the point that 9/11 was a staged false flag event this video gets a million stars. For the poor quality of research it gets 1 or 2 stars. To understand that 9/11 was faked by the government you only need to know two things:

1. President Bush said the Secret Service showed him video of the first plane hitting the tower just before he went into the classroom.
2. Only military officers of the highest rank could disable all air defense for over 1.5 hours",1471132800,,529,4.343434343434343

3918822,5,B002EP8TQG,"With work and just everyday life, Im always stressed. I often stay up at night with my mind racing with all of things I need to do. Ive been taking this product for over a week now and have definitely noticed that I am sleeping better. I don't find my mind racing as much and in the morning I feel more energized to tackle the day. I always try to solve my issues with natural products instead of prescription medicine, therefore, Im very happy there is a product that contains natural minerals and vitamins to help reduce stress. This item was received as a discount in exchange for an honest review and these supplements did not disappoint.",1460678400,,642,4.495726495726496
3918823,5,B002EP8TQG,"Well put together, although I've seen other ones that have went into much more detail. Really good movie if it's your first time hearing about this",1455580800,,147,4.6923076923076925
3918824,4,B002EP8TQG,"The reason I'm not going to give this five stars is not based on the content, but rather the lack of content. Essentially this is a watered down version of Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup, which is available free to watch on Amazon Prime. It's in HD instead of SD and some new shots have been added, but nothing spectacular. American Coup is much better.

3918825,5,B002EP8TQG,"They try to label those of us that know 9/11 was an inside job, as ""truthers"" ... how appropriate a name for those of us that look forward to the day when all the world knows the truth about the treason perpetrated in New York on Sept. 11 2001 by those in the ""Cheney"" administration
The real terrorists live right here among us, and call themselves Americans ...",1451001600,,363,4.352941176470588
3918826,5,B002EP8TQG,"New edit is brilliant and its short length really makes it easy to chew. I suggest watching the other editions first, as this is more of a summary of events.",1450742400,,157,4.266666666666667
3918827,2,B002EP8TQG,"I don't like this edition, the original it's a lot better.
I was also dissapointed it doesn't have options for subtitles in any languages. Wanted my Espaol folks to watch it :(",1443484800,,176,4.53125

3918846,3,B002EP8TQG,Purchased this movie for curiosity sake.. because I was told about it  by a customer when I worked @ a video store. It was interesting,1386201600,,134,4.36
3918847,5,B002EP8TQG,"Very good documentary. A lot of great questions asked that obviously will never be answered by our lovely government but nonetheless, a very thought provoking film. I personally believe it was an inside job, but if you're able to watch something with an open mind and take it all in, you can decide for yourself.",1377129600,3,312,4.6909090909090905

8368020,5,B002EP8TQG,"This documentary is good but I do think the attempt to cover all the key facts in a reduced version actually takes away the effectiveness. The Final Cut version is better and more thorough. The MAIN thing that disturbs me about this movie is that there are only less than 40 reviews of it thus far and it's been out to 2 years. The American people need to wake up to the fact that this was covered up by our own government. Regardless of who was behind the most terrible attack to ever happen to the American people (arguably, I suppose), our government has lied and deceived its people for way too long and is still lying today. What else is the government hiding from us today? I suspect more than anyone would ever believe possible. Soon the world will know and we will all be shocked. Wake up America!",1488240000,,805,4.373333333333333

8368024,5,B002EP8TQG,I saw this a while ago and have not seen a conspiracy theory on 911 that comes close to this!  It's exciting and upsetting at the same time!  Issues that are addressed in this documentary are valid and should demand explanation,1478995200,,227,4.512195121951219

8368026,5,B002EP8TQG,Everyone should watch this at least once in their life. People may call you a conspiracy nut but the US and other countries have done worse things to manipulate the public and have excuses to go to war.,1477958400,,202,4.342105263157895
