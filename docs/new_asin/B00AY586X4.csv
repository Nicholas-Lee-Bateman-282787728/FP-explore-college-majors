5527301,4,B00AY586X4,These were some really fun sci-fi flicks! We enjoyed the one with Russel Johnson.,1405123200,2,81,4.857142857142857
5527302,5,B00AY586X4,Great Old movies from the age of the drive-ins. So bad their good. The age before special effects got special. Got to love the Tin Box as well.,1404345600,8,143,4.142857142857143
5527303,4,B00AY586X4,three of roger corman's early sci-fi films. these are not blockbusters just entertaining. see russell johnson stranded on an island before he became 'the professor' (Gilligan's Island) in Attack of the Crab Monsters. the 'special effects' crabs are so bad they're good.,1403049600,8,269,5.428571428571429
5527304,4,B00AY586X4,This is a great pack of classic science fiction package.  I sat down & binge-watched them.  Completely up to my standards in this genre.,1395360000,,136,4.625
5527305,3,B00AY586X4,"As a kid of the 50's and 60's, I love these movies.  Quality of the prints varies, but overall very watchable.  However, be aware that the tin DVD case is problematic.  I like the tin case itself, but the interior mechanism of storage has the DVD's laying directly on a ""bed"" of foam-covered hard paper-like material cut out to fit the 2 overlapping discs.  The discs lay directly in contact with each other which could cause scuffing.  I also wonder how scuff-proof the foam-like material is.  The foam beds keep the discs in place by simple nubs, which I had to crush, and essentially destroy, to remove the discs without flexing the discs too much.  The foam also leaves foam ""dust"" on the face of the discs.  I thought of buying a double DVD case for the discs, then storing it in the tin.  But, the tin won't to fit a slim or regular case.  I may end up trashing the tin since it's basically worthless, and putting the DVD's into a regular case.  A shame.",1393545600,53,960,4.3977272727272725
5527306,5,B00AY586X4,if you are into the old time horror movies this is a nice collection. I love the 1950s sci fi flicks and these fit the bill very fast shipping recommend product and seller,1392422400,4,171,4.212121212121212
5527307,5,B00AY586X4,"Cheaper than the other set from shout, and as far as i can tell, it is the same product. G",1377734400,15,90,3.55

5527310,5,B00AY586X4,"I actually brought Roger Corman's Cult Classics - SCI-FI Classics Triple Feature so I could get a copy of the original NOT OF THIS EARTH which is in excellent condition on this DVD. The case is made of tin and you would think that was a good thing but inside the disk lays on a foam liner with just a paper like sleeve.  My disk was not scratched or otherwise damaged so I can't take any points off for that. It is just the packaging is of suspect quality. For the price this overall value of this Roger Corman's Cult Classics - SCI-FI Classics Triple Feature set is out of this world at under $7.  The quality of all of the movies is 8 out of 10 with TEN being remastered to near perfection.

While not mastered to near perfection this Roger Corman's Cult Classics - SCI-FI Classics Triple Feature set is still very well done and there is no movie in this set that suffers so much degradation that it is rendered unwatchable or even bad. The other movies are good and interesting and work as bygone relics of a past age that brought back awesome childhood memories for me. My honest rating has to give this Roger Corman's Cult Classics - SCI-FI Classics Triple Feature set five stars because, there is nothing seriously wrong with anything in this set and if you love old sci fi movies at this price this is a steal!",1435276800,2,1317,4.345528455284553

Here's what's on the discs (same content as the other Shout Factory set):

 ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" (1957)

 ""War of the Satellites"" (1958)

 ""Not of this Earth"" (1957)

As others have stated, the tin packaging is bad . The discs were slightly scratched because they came stacked atop one another and the plastic liner of the tin has black flocking that comes off as a fine powder. The graphics on the tin are also tacky IMHO; I'm not sure why Shout Factory went with the generic ""eye"" illustration instead of vintage or vintage style graphics which relate to the actual films.",1487980800,2,1105,4.839572192513369
