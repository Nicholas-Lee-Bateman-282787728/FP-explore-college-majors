8643605,5,B00INCDQ4O,"Actually a condensation of the Korean cultural mind set from the '80s onward. A self directed, self energized high school graduate through hard work and determination becomes a tax lawyer and in true capitalist fashion pursues potential clients any and everywhere. He's the type that you might have casually known in high school and if you should accidentally bump into him on the street a business card would immediately be in your hand. That's how the movie starts but when he very reluctantly takes up the trial case of a young pro-democracy advocate he transforms from selfish pursuits into a self sacrificing advocate for freedom.
Fictionalized but a lot of Korean historical truth. Well acted and eventually very engaging.",1404345600,8,728,5.126050420168068
