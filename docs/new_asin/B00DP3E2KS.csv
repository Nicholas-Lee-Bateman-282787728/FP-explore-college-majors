8595715,3,B00DP3E2KS,Not impressed. I generally liked dramatized supernatural horror. Was pretty cheaply made.,1475366400,,89,6.5
8595716,1,B00DP3E2KS,"So so stupid. All it is, is the same a&e shows and history channel shows with a different name to it. I swear I own now three different dvd's sets that r the same exact shows because they just changed the name on the cover. Really pissed!",1433203200,2,238,4.085106382978723

8595718,3,B00DP3E2KS,"A lot of the people in the stories seem very biased believing that any little sound or image they see is a ghost. Ever heard of dust (making what looks like ""orbs"" in pictures) and common camera errors are thought to be spirits. Oh boy. I like the scientists in the video explaining how normal everyday stuff can cause what other people deem as hauntings.",1381449600,,355,4.476923076923077
