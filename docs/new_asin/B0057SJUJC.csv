For anyone that is interested in barbershop and/or a cappella singing, this DVD is for you! The documentary follows all the behind-the-scenes drama of four different barbershop quartets that are competing at the International level for an opportunity to attain gold! The results are, at times, very close as well as controversial. A bass from one of the quartets expressed his opinion: 2nd place is still 2nd place!",1333152000,,504,5.158536585365853
4597714,5,B0057SJUJC,"Great introduction to the wonderful world of a cappella barbershop harmony. I'm a Sweet Adeline (women's Barbershop), and I loved this look into high level competing quartets. I've also ""forced"" many of my friends and family members to watch it and they have really enjoyed the peek into why I love it so much. Highly recommended!",1445385600,,330,4.910714285714286

4597719,5,B0057SJUJC,"As a musician and Barbershopper for many years, I'm always looking for ways that the general public can see what music and singing are all about, what it really means to people, and how exciting it can be!  This movie certainly accomplishes that goal.

It most follows three quartets through the film as it takes you on a tour of the world of barbershop harmony - 4-part close harmony a cappella singing.  You get to see what the Barbershop Harmony Society is really all about, and the fellowship and brotherhood felt between guys all over the world, who only have one thing in common: they sing, and they love it!  You also get a closer look into the dynamics of singing in a quartet, where four guys can start out at singers and wind up lifelong friends.  Finally, you get a peak at what barbershop harmony really sounds like - not the old-timey sound you heard in the 50's, but the new exciting chords, rhythms, and songs.  You hear what power four voices can actually have, despite having no accompanying instruments or drums.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn about barbershop or the Society, anyone who wants to share the love and joy of singing with anyone else, and, well, anyone who loves to sing!  It's a great representation of the society, but also a fantastic look into music and singing and how it can change your life in so many ways!",1403827200,,1374,4.534412955465587
4597720,5,B0057SJUJC,"I watched this due to a recommendation from a friend. It's outstanding, and actually quite touching (which was unexpected). I come from a band background and had virtually no interest in barbershop until I saw the film.",1401321600,,219,4.945945945945946
4597721,5,B0057SJUJC,"Informative, interesting and inspiringand something truly American, our own unique tradition.  It is fascinating what close and
creative  relationships  are formed within the Barbershop community.  Not only does the harmony produce bigger than life sounds,
but also relationships.",1384819200,,280,6.2894736842105265
4597722,5,B0057SJUJC,The sound of ringing chords. The fun of competition. This cd is a wonderful view of the top quartets in th barbershop harmony society and the personalities of some of the guys.,1372377600,,176,4.53125
4597723,5,B0057SJUJC,"Highly recommended for anyone considering a career in performing arts. This movie follows several barbershop harmony quartets as they compete to win the annual International gold medal. This singing style has been around for over 75 years - and though current televised singing competitions can attempt it, they just can't match the sound of a locked in harmony chord.  These guys sing tight harmony without instruments to back them up or 'autotune' electronics to correct pitch. These guys are the real deal!  The groups are the best of the best from college age youngsters to retirees. Being scored on a standard point system by a panel of judges on song arrangement, presentation, and sound quality is a nerve wracking experience and this film captures the tension on stage and backstage as they wait to hear the awards announced.",1372377600,5,833,5.028985507246377

8461132,1,B0057SJUJC,"Suspicious product.  Ordered, and received on March 30, 2017.  Wouldn't play in either laptop or desktop PC.  The first screen did come up, that included ""Do not worship false idols"" graphic oval (as another reviewer pointed out).  I will return for credit.  Too bad, because subject matter and story line could be riveting.  Maybe this project fell apart in post-production or thereafter.  Amazon shouldn't sell any more copies until this is cleared up.",1490918400,,454,5.136986301369863

8461136,1,B0057SJUJC,"The original documentary was terrific, but what Amazon has for rent, sale and purchase is a rip off. I loved this movie on Netflix and when they dropped it I ordered the DVD from Amazon. It took five months (that's another story for another time) to receive my copy but I sat down to watch it as soon as it arrived and I was concerned and ultimately extremely disappointed and upset. I don't know where Amazon is getting these DVDs or who they are letting sell them thru Amazon but they are not the real movie. First of all, the title screen has had a religious message inserted in big letters prominently displayed below the movie title. THEN, and I feel sorry for anyone who has not seem the original movie because you don't know what you are missing, this version slices, dices and completely spoils the climatic and best song performance of the whole movie, performed by MaxQ near the end of the film. Don't waste your money on this version and if you want to see the real MaxQ performance just go to YouTube and search for MaxQ--Here's to the Losers, and pick the clip that's almost 6-1/2 minutes long.",1466812800,3,1107,4.485148514851486
