8182872,5,B000O5B4OC,"Just because a previous viewer called this DVD ""right wing trash"", I decided to view it for myself.  It is actually compilation of speeches President Ford gave as President, none of which are very political or remotely ""right wing"".  The previous viewer needs to actuall WATCH this DVD instead of just blindly commenting on what he supposes is ""right wing trash"" just because it is about a Republican President.",1193702400,6,411,4.942028985507246
