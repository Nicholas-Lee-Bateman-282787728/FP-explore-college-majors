8442910,5,B004V4RV5I,"A insightful program which looks behind the scenes of putting together the Olympic games. Even though this program focuses on the 1992 Olympic games in Barcelona, Spain, the technologies and and preparations are the same for any city hosting the Olympics. These were the 25th Olympic games hosted in that year in Barcelona. There were 16 days of games, 2 weeks of media madness covering 5,000 hours of global media coverage of the games - the task was compared to that of putting a man on the moon!

It took Barcelona six years to prepare its city to host the games and lots of new infrastructures had to be built - apartments, a new airport, hotels, restaurants and, of course, the ""Olympic Village"", itself. The new technology put in place had to track one million visitors and 38,000 athletes and officials, including dignitaries. Two million meals for various cultures had to be prepared, and accommodations for 15,000 reporters. The technology put in place had to measure times in thousandths of a second (as in the 100-meter sprint), using sophisticated equipment which would show final results in a mere 2-3 seconds.

After the games were finally over, Barcelona was a city almost entirely re-built. The locals were pleased with the results of the Olympic games, but more pleased to get their lives and city back to normal again.

Interesting look behind the scenes of what it takes to pull everything together to create a flawless Olympic host city, and create a magnificent end-result to the games themselves. A really interesting program!",1465776000,,1548,4.946153846153846
