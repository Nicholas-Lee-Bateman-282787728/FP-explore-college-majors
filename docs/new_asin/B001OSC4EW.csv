3736071,1,B001OSC4EW,"I have fibromyalgia and back pain from herniated discs and was looking for a gentle technique to stretch and strengthen the muscles establish better balance.  After reading others post it sound like a good choice for folks with back problems, however for someone with more than just the occasional back pain or over exertion this might not be for you. The deep bending at the waist faired my herniated discs. The great amount of balance needed from the beginning was hard for me to accomplish and caused more pain even day or more latter. He walks through the motions very quickly and each pose seems a little too advance for someone like myself with serious back problems/pain who is not too familiar with TAI CHI.  I do take a beginning TAI CHI course once a week and find it more gentle and beneficial that this DVD. I thought this DVD could add to what I am already doing. I would suggest anyone who has serious back issues find a class and have someone teach you how to build on each pose in order to complete a movement, increase flexibility and stability. The DVD advertises for ""no audience off limits"", but I suggest asking your physician. I did consult my physician, but for me it came down to starting with a gently, step by step lessons that you will not get from this DVD.",1302480000,51,1285,4.510729613733906
3736072,5,B001OSC4EW,Scott Cole spends the video talking all kinds of crazy Eastern philosophy mumbo-jumbo. I can't help but roll my eyes as I do all the postures he models. I can't help but think no way is this gonna work. But my chronic lower back pain is gone. Scott Cole is a genius. And a little bit weird.,1286323200,31,290,4.105263157894737
3736073,5,B001OSC4EW,"This DVD is an excellant intro for biginners of all levels. The instructions reflects the values he offers. They are easily followable and more importantly they deliver. Scott Cole is charismatic and immediately likeable, non judgemental. If there is a minus it is the music accompaning the exercise, but that is debatable. I prefer solo japanese bamboo flute whenever I practice. Bottom line for those with or without osteoarthritis back pain, this is worth buying.",1280016000,25,466,5.226666666666667
3736074,5,B001OSC4EW,This is a nice Tai Chi set that really loosens your back. Great for a stiff back after sitting at work all day.,1263340800,20,111,3.869565217391304
3736075,5,B001OSC4EW,"Excellent video for beginners. Plus even those that may have some knowledge of Tai Chi, it would be good for them also. Does lots of concentration of relaxing, especially back muscles, strengthening, stretching, for the lower back as well as neck and cervical spine.",1241740800,56,266,5.068181818181818
3736076,5,B001OSC4EW,i USE THIS TAPE EVERY DAY.  I HAD A SERIOUS BACK INJURY RESULTING IN PAIN AND STIFFNESS.  SCOTT'S TAPE HAS HELPED STRENGTHEN MY BACK - MY PAIN IS NOW MINIMAL. HE'S A GREAT TEACHER - I PLAN TO BUY SOME OF HIS OTHER TAPES AS WELL.,1461196800,2,228,3.9347826086956523
3736077,3,B001OSC4EW,"I am leaving this review after my first time trying this DVD.  Most importantly, the movements are gentle on my back and neck- I have scoliosis and a compressed nerve in my neck, but I am strong and in good physical fitness- and I did not have to make any modifications.  My complaint is that after the section where he walks you through all the postures, the next section where you ""put it all together"" skips around in some really confusing camera angles.  There are a couple times where he mentions what you should be doing with your legs, but the camera is zoomed in on his torso.  I wish that the second part was filmed straight on without turning and changing angles so often.  This DVD is not supposed to be artistic,  but rather informative, and I feel that the ever changing camera angles in the second part take away from the instruction that is so necessary in a beginner DVD.  That being said, I will continue to use this DVD as an aid to my back pain and posture, and will hopefully learn the postures used throughout the instruction in order to do the sequence smoothly even when the full pose isn't visible.",1452297600,3,1122,4.443902439024391
3736078,3,B001OSC4EW,"From a senior citizen point of view, I prefer the approach Scott Cole used recently in his DVD ""Tai Chi for Balance and Mobility""  It would be great to have a remake of the Back Care DVD using a format similar to the Balance and Mobility DVD.",1428364800,2,242,4.148936170212766
3736079,5,B001OSC4EW,Wish I had tried this before back surgery! Love this!,1427328000,,53,4.4
3736080,5,B001OSC4EW,"I've always wanted to know about Tai Chi and Scott Cole is great.  I'm 76 yrs. old and if I can do it, anyone can.  Enjoy!  My back is actually getting better.",1425254400,2,159,3.90625
3736081,4,B001OSC4EW,I like the workout. Good explanation of forms. Like all westerners he goes too fast,1420761600,2,83,4.6
3736082,5,B001OSC4EW,"I first used this DVD after injuring my lower back while performing heavy sets of deadlifts at the gym. I have scoliosis and a background in tai chi. As a longtime fan of Abs of Steel 2, I had a lot of confidence in Scott's ability to deliver on his promises. The Tai Chi for Back Care DVD delivers with incredible ingenuity. The ease with which the practitioner manipulates his/her own spine using tai chi postures is out of this world! I now perform this workout weekly and haven't needed to see a chiropractor in months. This DVD has saved me hundreds of dollars in co-payments so far. Scott's teaching style is so simplistic that even a novice can easily get a grasp of the workout in one viewing. This is easily one of the most valuable purchases you could ever make.",1419811200,5,772,4.443661971830986
3736083,5,B001OSC4EW,I have permanent injuries to my L4-S1 vertebrae and this dvd has been such a lifesaver in helping me to stay mobile and manage pain! We also use it as a calming activity for my son with sensory processing disorder and it's improved his focus and concentration 100%! I highly recommend this dvd.,1416441600,5,294,4.566037735849057

3736088,5,B001OSC4EW,This was very easy to learn and it's very relaxing.  I have enjoyed using this video for exercise and back care.,1386115200,,112,4.333333333333333
3736089,5,B001OSC4EW,These Tai Chi exercises are not difficult and has helped decrease my back pain.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who suffers with back pain.,1382054400,,145,4.576923076923077
3736090,4,B001OSC4EW,"I thought it would be longer but Scott does it again. This may be best for those who have already used one of Scott tai-chi videos. I saw his video and Janet doing tai-chi + aerobics before and his explanation of tai chi philosophy and movements (and breathing) was more thorough. For those complaining about the bonus clip that doesn't include talking. He does it at the end of the lesson with talking. The bonus clip is for people who don't need the instructions any more and who just want to focus. Good video and if you're short on time, a definite tai chi go to....",1381276800,2,570,4.386792452830188

3736092,3,B001OSC4EW,"I bought this DVD with the idea of trying to do some exercise but found Tai Chi is not for me.  The positions, if I am doing them correctly, were too hard on my knees.",1368230400,3,167,3.7714285714285714
3736093,5,B001OSC4EW,I really like the way Scott Cole teaches Tai Chi to the class/viewers. I have used this product and would recommend this product to everyone!,1367452800,,141,4.68
3736094,4,B001OSC4EW,If you have a bad back and need to do some good exercises to try and keep the weight off as well as remain mobile then this DVD will do the trick. I found that the only exercises that I couldn't do were the kick movments.,1362355200,11,221,3.8260869565217392
3736095,5,B001OSC4EW,I have several issues going on in my back and this and other dvd's and routines is helping me to get stronger.  Highly recommend this.,1360368000,2,134,4.36
3736096,5,B001OSC4EW,Very easy to follow instructions. I have loved all of the Tai Chi DVD's by Scott Cole.  He is an amazing instructor and Tai Chi has really helped lower my blood pressure and it is helping with my energy level as well.  Love the workout,1359849600,2,235,4.2
3736097,5,B001OSC4EW,My fiance and I love this. We do it several mornings a week. The moves in the DVD are simple and easy to follow giving us a routine that we can easily complete in about 45 minutes. We're still going through the intro each day as we learn the exercises but it's enjoyable.,1358208000,2,271,4.132075471698113
3736098,5,B001OSC4EW,"I have gotten my daughter and wife to join me in this workour, as they both have back problems, and they are very enthusiastic about it. Cole is a wonderful, welcoming, encouraging teacher. I am confident that their backs will be substantially healed by the future.",1356652800,2,265,4.782608695652174
3736099,5,B001OSC4EW,This was a Good video and it was  easy to follow.  It met all my expectations.  I enjoyed this video.,1355356800,,101,3.95
3736100,2,B001OSC4EW,"The video explains the basic moves well, but when they go into the routine they do close ups of Scott Coles upper body so you can't see what he's doing. Furthermore he doesn't say a word in this section so even if you memorize the moves there's really no way of telling what you should be doing.",1333843200,17,295,4.192982456140351
3736101,4,B001OSC4EW,"I originally purchased this for my husband who has back injury. When we tried it together, it was too difficult for him to do. I wound up doing the entire workout and I was surprised that I was sweating somewhat. I work out 45 min, 5-6 days per week.  It's a great workout, but I would not consider it ""gentle""....however, I am older.",1332720000,8,334,4.301587301587301
3736102,5,B001OSC4EW,"I had microscopic spine surgery at the L4-L5 and L5-S  in August 2011 after having 2 ruptured discs from a car accident and have been out on leave from work. I was in pretty bad shape with a 7mm disc deep and 10mm wide at the L4-L5 and 7mm deep at the L5-S and my Neurosurgeon cleaned out the ruptured discs as much as possible. Physical therapy was helping me strengthen my core but it wasn't doing much in terms of helping me be more flexible so I started looking into other exercises that could help bring relief to my joints and loosen my spine since the stiffness in the spine was making my body vulnerable to more injuries.

After getting clearance from my Physical Therapist (always consult your healthcare professional first), I've been using this DVD as well as 4 of Scott's other DVD's for the past 3 weeks and it has brought so much relief to my joints and spine. While doing one of the moves from this DVD last week, I felt and heard my spine adjusting on its own and felt more loose and flexible afterwards. I was so relieved and happy when I experienced this because I had been living with an extremely stiff lower back like you wouldn't believe for months. He guides you through each move slowly and explains each move and the purpose of it so well that you can jump right in and start practicing with him. He also seems to work with the injured and geriatric population according to all the DVD's he has out so I was glad to know he created the program with a purpose to heal. Not only did it help me physically, it also helps clear your head of stress and deal with the stress of life much more peacefully. The music he uses of Daveed is excellent!

I did some background research on Scott Cole before purchasing his DVD's and found out this guy has accomplished so much in the fitness world and is rated as one of the top 5 fitness pros in the nation according to IDEA Health & Fitness. I also reached out to Scott to ask him about his Tai Chi training so I can take lessons here in West Los Angeles, CA. I found out that Scott learned Yang-Style Tai chi from Tim O'Connor in Los Angeles, CA who's a 4th generation Tai Chi Instructor coming down from the Yang Cheng Fu lineage of the Yang Family of Yang-Style Tai Chi. Scott had combined Tai Chi and Qi Gong along with his fitness experience to target his program to help people become more mobile and flexible. I think it's also a great program for people with healthy backs.

Hope this review was helpful and I hope I get a chance to attend one of Scott's live Tai Chi sessions in Palm Springs one of these days.",1326931200,36,2582,4.295687885010267
3736103,5,B001OSC4EW,"I purchased this DVD for my mom who suffers from chronic back pain.  However, I use it as well and I notice a difference in my overall wellbeing after practicing.  Great for beginners and easy to follow.",1315267200,5,203,4.45945945945946
3736104,5,B001OSC4EW,"This video is SO well done.  Scott guides us through Tai Chi moves set to soothing music,  birds chirping and waves rolling.  He does every move MIRROR IMAGE, so there is no disruptive scrambling on the part of the participant to switch sides because the move was to ""your other right""!  The viewer has the option of segments with commentary and without.  Scott has a pleasant voice and manner, so I enjoy hearing him talk me through the moves.  Every other ""exercise tape"" I own, I turn down the volume because I tire of the teacher's running comments!  The gym setting is beautiful aged brick wall and hardwood flooring...and the beach in Hawaii has pristine sand and blue sky filled with clouds.  I relax in either venue and can already feel strength in my back and less pain after just one month.",1312761600,5,800,4.584507042253521
3736105,5,B001OSC4EW,"I have been doing this as part of my regular routine for about 2 weeks now and I have to admit my back does feel better.  I work as a computer programmer and I also have a horse that I ride so my back is usually pretty sore from the sitting all day and then the riding.  I'm not saying this will cure every back pain out there, but mine has greatly reduced.
Very easy to follow and quite relaxing.",1304467200,6,397,3.95

8331340,4,B001OSC4EW,"This is a very good video but it was a little tough for me because I already have some back problems.  I have been able to adjust some so that I can a part of it but not all at one time.  It is very well made and easy to follow.  One needs t have some conditions

8331343,5,B001OSC4EW,I have a number of Scott's dvd's but this is my favorite.  He has a workout on the second half that is in front of the ocean with no talking. I loved the sound of silence and my body feels so loose when I finish.,1470441600,,212,3.7111111111111112
