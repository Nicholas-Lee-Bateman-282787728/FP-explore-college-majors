Don't get me wrong, the show is great and earns a five-star rating, it's the offer that is misleading. Hopefully giving it two stars will get fellow buyers to read further.

Instead of dishing out $ 35 for season 2 and fall for the gimmick of getting season 1 for free, go for individual dvds and pay $ 6 for season 1, then set yourself back another $ 14 for season 2.
Additional shipping cost per dvd will not cost you $15 (that is the price difference).

The price reviews for the above dvds are done at the same time (during the time this review is posted) - hopefully amazon will review its pricing and consumer exercise awareness on similar offers.",1205193600,9,995,6.301470588235294
2404610,5,B000B7HZYG,"Three's Company - Seasons 1 and 2 contains some hilarious and creative episodes. You get every episode from season 1 which isn't a full season since the show was a mid-season replacement and season two which is a full season. John Ritter, Joyce DeWitt, and Suzanne Somers had flawless chemistry, and it's the best reason to pick up this beloved show, buy it today!",1202515200,,364,4.703125

2404612,5,B000B7HZYG,"Call it nostalgia for the seventies and early eighties when I used to live in the US several months a year. When I saw that three's company was on dvd I simply could not resist a chance to live again the fun experiences and moments I had had when watching the series in the States. And let me tell you, I don't regret the purchase: I can run those funny episodes again and again and keep up with my English and joke-making. I know that the sexual connotations at the time raised a commotion, and that most of it would not be considered politically correct even nowadays, but I don't care. I keep loving the jokes and a special thought goes to the late John Ritter. Can't wait to receive the last four seasons and see that special episode when Jack is being sexually harrassed by the female boss of the diner he works in, then, by the attorney that was supposed to defend his case. Pity we can't bring back the dead for more seasons!

2404613,5,B000B7HZYG,"John Ritter has touched our lives with his spark and classic comedy for more than 2 generations. Three's Company is one such classic TV show that started and boosted his career. I became a believer.
I was satisfied and releived to know what a great deal this combo is. At first, I thought they were going to take Season 1 and Season 2 and combine them on only 1 DVD, -with only 1 case. That is NOT what I wanted. However that's the way it looks.

Incredibly, NO. You do get Season 1 in its entirety and the entire Season 2 seperately,- combined together in one plastic wrapping. What a deal! So in that case, why on earth would anybody purchase Season 1 then Season 2 seperately?? AND pay full price?

No. This is great. This is a must for Three's Company fans buying their first DVD as 2 Seasons at once. Unfortunately, there are no audio subtitles (CC for hearing imparied) available on the DVD's. Season 1 doesn't have any 'behind the scenes' or featurettes but Season 2 does.

For more information and the entire episode guide, refer to ""Three's Company- Season 1"" and ""Three's Company- Season 2""",1133827200,23,1100,4.517587939698492

8082762,5,B000B7HZYG,"""Three's Company"" played in syndication with edited episodes. In this excellent bargain of a DVD with the first two seasons, you get special bonus features like the original pilot episode. The first season lasted only six episodes with a controversial subject of two single women and a single man living together in Santa Monica, California. John Ritter played Jack Tripper wonderfully and perfectly with slapstick comedy. He was first cast to play originally David (based on the British series known as ""Man of the House). The name was changed along with the roommates and location from Hollywood to Santa Monica. Originally, David was from New York and aspired to be a film director. In the series, David became Jack Tripper, an aspiring chef.

The extra bonuses are worth the expense. Especially since the episodes in syndication often edited out the ending of the episodes, I always wondered what happened when the Ropers and roommates ended up at the Stevens Party on Christmas Day. The first season was short with only six episodes. The second season includes 25 episodes with the extra features such as the original pilot with Valerie Curtin (All The Presidents Men) as Jenny, the original roommate.

Audra Lindley and Norman Fell were terrific as Stanley and Helen Roper. I especially enjoy the them in the original pilot as George and Helen. Audra had more of a New York City accent in the pilot. Like I have written, the syndicated episodes were edited and now you can see the series in all its glory. This series should be studied by aspiring sitcom writers and developers to understand the development of a sitcom from British inspiration to an American adaptation.

There is also a tribute in the season 2 to the late John Ritter (Jack Tripper). Joyce DeWitt spoke perfectly at his sudden, unexpected loss. John Ritter died too soon and was beloved by millions of fans, friends, relatives and colleagues.

There are plenty of memorable guest appearances like Dick Sergeant, Loni Anderson, David Dukes, Lee Bryant, James Cromwell, Natalie Schaefer, Anne Schedeen, Joanna Kerns and more in the series.",1501372800,,2112,5.0085470085470085
