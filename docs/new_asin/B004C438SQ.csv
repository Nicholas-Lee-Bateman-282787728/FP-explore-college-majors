8422741,5,B004C438SQ,I will purchase this DVD next week....I would today but I'm managing my finances. The title fits how probate court assisted with my Daughters mother in destroying any bond with my daughter despite my efforts to be in her life. Court officials acted as if I was committing a crime in my attempts to be in her life going back 20years,1453420800,,331,4.442622950819672
8422742,5,B004C438SQ,Excellent documentary on how Father's have been railroaded for child support by the courts.,1453248000,,91,5.571428571428571
8422743,4,B004C438SQ,"This Dvd gives a view point that is often overlooked in western society. I believe if at all possible, you should study relationships before you get involved with a person because this dvd clearly shows the mental and emotional strain that it causes.",1432598400,,250,4.837209302325581
8422744,4,B004C438SQ,"This tells the other side of the story.  Women are portrayed too often as the ""victims"" in child custody cases.  Some are too vindictive towards the father to warrant any empathy.  Custody battles harm EVERYONE involved.  It was painful to watch.",1421798400,,246,4.926829268292683
8422745,5,B004C438SQ,I love the suggestions in this movie. .Its great when someone not only talks about the problem but also gives some possible solutions,1374278400,2,133,4.826086956521739
8422746,5,B004C438SQ,"The men who appear in this video have been where I have been, have walked where I have walked and have cried the same tears I have cried.  We, as non-custodial fathers, need to come together and fight this unfair system.  This movie, if anything, helps us realize that we are not alone.  It does not present a plan of action nor does it have a clear 'call to action' at the end of the movie.  It is simply allowing men to tell their story in their own words.  For the women reading this review, if you think the men in this movie are unique in some way - think again.  We all have cried alone at night or in our cars after dropping off our children.  If you are unaware of that fact, watch this movie.  If you are aware of it and you are party to a divorce/custody case, examine your heart and ask yourself, is vengeance and hate worth you stealing your children's innocence and their child hood.  If your answer to that is anything but no, God help this country.",1369267200,8,963,4.190217391304348
8422747,5,B004C438SQ,Janks Morton is one of the most important filmmakers of our day. This is a groundbreaking movie that shows what countless men I've talked to and gotten to know have gone through. Incredible job by Janks. My only complaint: I wanted more! And one day I would like to see Janks explore all those (mostly) men in jail due to the abuses perpetrated by women manipulating the family court system.,1365206400,7,391,4.6
8422748,5,B004C438SQ,Truth be told is what is needed and he definitely gave it his all. The court system is not for the benefit of the child despite what you may think or hear from those that are looking at living well above their means at your expense.,1353974400,4,232,4.065217391304348
