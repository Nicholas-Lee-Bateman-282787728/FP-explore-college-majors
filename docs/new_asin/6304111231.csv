805589,5,6304111231,What can I say?  I loved the movie as a child and enjoy revisiting it as an adult.  The stop-motion is dated by today's standards but has a unique look that is still fun to watch.  This movie has the epic feel of old Hollywood mixed with some 80's cheesiness.  What's not to like?,1520899200,,280,4.12962962962963
805590,4,6304111231,"1981 film based on Greek Mythology on Perseus saving the Princess Andromeda from the Monster is the last film involvement of special effects wizard Ray Harryheusen, who created a number of monsters just as Eiji Tsuburaya of Godzilla did. It is often picked as the material to introduce Greek Mythology to the uninitiated. The film also has some special appearance of some notable actors and actresses such as Maggie Smith one of the staple figures in British films known by the Harry Potters' Professor McGonall, Laurence Olivier the legendary Shakespearean actor and Burgess Meredith known by the role of Rocky Balboa's coach Mickey. Ammon, a poet played by Meredith assists and guides young Perseus to the right track.

The film plot adds original characters not in Greek Mythology such as the mechanical owl Bubo, Calibos, human-turned monster due to the curse.
Then the story goes like typical Ray Harryhausen-involved fantasy films. A boy ventures into a given quest, saves the damsel in mistress, Andromeda and conquers the monsters. As far as you like the cliches of Harryheusen world you will definitely love the film. Among the Harryhausen involved films I have seen Titans is one of the best. The biggest plot hole, however, might be the title itself. From the title you might expect the fantasy adventure involving different giant monsters taking each side of the warring parties. The only Titan worthy of being called a ""titan"" is Harken, a typical Harryhausen-created Kaiju. Its Pegasus is no Falcor (Neverending Story) which may not give so much craving to mount yourself. Although the film was a great success, it became the swan song for him and with ILM team booming, maybe it was the right time for him to retire.

Verdict: Good adventure film that marked the end of Harryhausen Days
Rating: 86 of 100 Some loose parts in plot.

805699,5,6304111231,"The first thing that is of notice is the great Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion affects the Kraken and Medusa is unique. I have several other movies with his work.

Better actors could not be cast in the various roles; I have to mention a few, however this does not detract from the other performers. Maggie Smith is recognized from many BBC productions and fits the part of Thetis. Judi Bowker as Andromeda has to play a range of emotions and is beautiful enough to be a princess. Of course everyone recognizes Burgess Merideth; I remember him best as Commander Egan Powell, Intelligence Officer, in ""In Harm's Way"" (1965). Who could show the authority that Zeus wields authority better than Laurence Olivier does.

Titans were around before Zeus's crowd so many people are not aware of their story.

This basic story is that the only daughter of Acrisius has given birth to a child out of wedlock and for this she must die. Danae and her young son, Perseus are placed in a wooden coffin and set adrift with the intent that the Sea will do the deed. Naturally as with all Greek plays this act is spotted in time by Zeus who sets them safely on a foreign shore. This is the start of a cat and mouse power struggle among the gods and involves mankind with a beautiful Princess Andromeda, an amiable playwright Ammon, and many mythical creatures from the classics.",1502668800,,1359,4.630705394190872

805770,5,6304111231,"Still great to watch this and recall the story. It is my opinion that when an ancient story is made/shown and produced by Hollywood, it should not be over-done with special effects. That makes it seem fake. When the film is a little degraded (or use CGI to downgrade) it makes it seem like you are watching from then. Like the 300 movie was special effects but the final rendering made it seem like it may have been from the time. the newer Clash movie is so clear and way-over done with effects (plus lame story and acting) it was a shame to watch. So I came back to this and enjoyed. The ending is great when they also make reference to the star constellations and how man on earth may not need devise intervention if they are brave and honest and use for the good.",1499299200,,767,4.260273972602739

Conversely, I have an HD version taped on my DVR from TCM and it actually looks better. Go figure. It probably didn't undergo restoration either. Some movie classics have but it's expensive and the studio isn't going to spend that kind of money for this. Some just get up-converted. Patton and Gladiator had bad transfer too..and people complained. They both were re-done and came out great !

A note to parents of younger kids (approx 8-10 y.o.), if you are inclined to have your child avoid the over-action and gore of more recent ""kid"" films, this original ""Clash"" is tame enough to tell a grand story without too much violence and horror, but while keeping the elements of excitement and adventure as Perseus battles the legendary Medusa and other monsters.",1477353600,2,677,4.869565217391305

Within this color, single-disc, DVD in widescreen format which is 118-minutes long, fascinates the viewing audience with non-stop, mortal and divine, action and adventure drama. Very handsome and sexy, Actor - Harry Hamlin stars as Perseus, the son of the mortal Princess of Argos and Zeus - the Head of the Greek, mythological gods. But, her father - the vengeful, cruel and jealous, King of Argos, had her placed alive into a floating casket, along with her infant son Prince Perseus, as horrific punishment for her promiscuity. And also, too supposedly, appease the wrath of the gods. However, Zeus didn't take kindly to seeing his beautiful, royal, mistress and her innocent, infant son which he fathered, mercilessly cast adrift. So, after having made known his displeasure to the other gods, he called upon his brother Posedion - the god of the sea, to unleash the sea monster Kraken, to destroy both the City of Argos and it's King. And, the sea waves were to leave Princess Danae of Argos and her son - Perseus, alive and unharmed. Safely drifting to the welcoming shores of an inhabited island. And so began, the story of Perseus... a demi-god (half mortal/half divine), to live in obscurity until he had grown into manhood. Then suddenly..., eligible Perseus, sees and meets with the beautiful Princess Andromeda, whom he wants to marry. But ultimately, he has to first rescue her from the wrath and revenge of a goddess and the deadly, snake-headed, Medusa. In so doing, however, Perseus meets up with the last winged horse that flys, named: Pegasus, and faces off with giant scorpions, a two-headed dog called Dioskilos, and the sea monster, Kraken. This star studded cast which includes Actress - Judi Bowker as Andromeda, Maggie Smith, Ursula Andress, Burgess Meredith, Claire Bloom and Sir Laurence Olivier as Zeus, thrills the audience with their regal, innovative and divine interaction with mortals, their care and concern and even provisions for their daily lives, complete with plenty of action and adventures that come from that divine interaction. The Special Features - include: A conversation with Motion Effects/Legend - Ray Harryhausen, the theatrical trailer and although this film has audio in both English and French, the subtitles are in English, French and Spanish. An engaging film from Metro-Goldwin and Mayer (MGM), that's a PG rated - Charles Schiner Production, which entertains it's audience in more ways than one. A heroic, mythological drama that emphasizes and underscores that the mythological gods are involved in mortal lives, apparently much more, than one would think.

I was grateful that I decided to watch it before he did. Near the beginning of the movie, they show a completely naked woman.

Harry Hamlin does an excellent job of portraying the young and bold Perseus.  Burgess Meredith also does a fine performance as the poet Ammon who serves as a mentor to Perseus.  Though the special effects may be a bit dated they go a long way in making this movie fun to watch.  Parents and teachers who desire to show this film as part of Greek mythology lessons should be aware it contains two or three scenes of brief nudity.  Still, Clash of the Titans is a great story of romance and adventure from Greek mythology.",1454112000,,665,4.409836065573771

807400,4,6304111231,"Listen people who hate the transfer, this is from DVDTALK on the blu-ray's video and audio quality:

 Clash of the Titans' packaging ominously notes, ""This film has been remastered utilizing state-of-the-art digital technology while maintaining the visual appearance of the original theatrical release."" This is an absolutely true statement; indeed, the film looks better than I remembered it in a theater back in 1981. Presumably this disclaimer is to ward off complaints about the picture quality that is, admittedly, not the greatest. Popular as Harryhausen's movies are, in high-definition shifts in grain between Harryhausen's composites and straight cuts only becomes more obvious: Hey! There must be an effect coming up because everything suddenly got grainy all of a sudden!

On Clash there may have been a deliberate effort to hide this somewhat by shooting as much of the film as possible in soft focus with fast, grainy stock. Even in the non-effects sequences, the image is so soft at times it actually looks inferior to the (excellent) Blu-ray of the Pride and Prejudice miniseries, and that was filmed in Super 16. Add to that, it seems like at least half the film's effects scenes take place in dark caves or at night; the overuse of day-for-night photography may have been another attempt to hide the graininess of the composites, but it must've wreaked havoc on drive-in screenings.

The 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio features surprisingly lively use of early Dolby Stereo, though one line of dialogue is curiously missing: at 12:07, after a shot of a naked Dana strolling down the beach there's a cut to Zeus who opens his mouth but his line is not heard on the soundtrack (""She's a honey?""). 1.0 tracks in French, Latin and Castilian Spanish, and optional subtitles in all those languages are included. My disc defaulted to Japanese menu options on my purchased-in-Japan PlayStation 3.",1417132800,,1898,5.093247588424437

807489,3,6304111231,"Its  an  interesting  movie  worth  watching.  About  3  or  4  different  Gods.  &  don't  worry  Zeus  is  not  the  real  God  in  reality  the  Almighty  Jesus  Christ!  Persus  as  a  baby  him &  his  &  mother  are  thrown  wrongfully  into  a  coffin  &  thrown  in  the  ocean.  &  Zeus  decides  to  punish  King  Archrisious  for  what  he's  done.  The  almighty  cracken  is  released  &  destroys  Arggos.  Zeus's  errand  runner  is  told  to  make  sure  that  Perseus  &  Denaie  are  brought  to  some  remote  peaceful  Island  where  Perseus  grows  up.  &  once  is  a  full  adult  is  now  living  a  contented  relaxed  life.  I  don't  know  why  Zeus  got  mad  at  that  God  Feddish,  for  picking  up  Perseus  &  setting  him  down.  To  me  it  made  sense.  Perseus  had  to  learn  about  the  world.  Feddish  did  have  a  point  there.
Perseus  is  destined  to  be  victorious.  Calibos  the  son  of  the  goddess  Feddish,  had  a  curse  brought  upon  him  by  Zeus  because  of  the  crimes  he's  committed,  hunted  &  destroyed  every  living  creature.  &  got  a  curse  on  him  which  made  him  look  like  the  Devil.  Perseus  also  learns  of  a  young  girl  destined  to  be  queen.  Andromida,  whom  forced  by  Calibos  to  make  her  soul  come  to  him  in  her  sleep.  With  the  old  mans  help  (Burgess Maridith)  Perseus  catches  Peagasus  the  flying  horse.  With  the  help  from  the  invisible  helmet,  he  was  given  good  steel  wapons  by  the  Gods,  a  sword  which  was  like  no  metal  the  old  man  had  ever  seen  as  he  said.  A  sword  that'll  cut  through  anything,  a  shield  &  a  helmet.
Weapons  different  than  most  provided  by  the  Gods.  Something  one  can  truly  admire!  In  real  life  perhaps  you'd  find  stuff  like  that  only  in  a  museum.  Andromida  urges  Calibos  to  lift  his  curse,  Calibos  refuses  &  Andromida  is  asked  to  leave.  She  throws  the  gift  from  Calibos  down  on  the  ground.  Maybe  he  hurt  her  feelings.  Calibos  immediatley  spots  an  intruder
doesn't  see  Perseus  because  he's  invisible  but  sees  the  foot  prints.  &  Decides  to  follow.  &  attacks  perseus.  &  they  fight.  Calibos  looses  a  hand.  &  Perseus  spares  his  life  on  one  condition  that  he  renounce  his  curse.  Deciding  not  to  do  that  he  turns  to  Goddess  Feddish  for  answers  &  Justice  or  revenge  for  Perseus  wounding  him.  I  guess  Justice  is  what Calibos  wanted  I  think.  Feddish  tells  Queenn  Cassiopaya  to  prepare  her  daughter  for  the  Cracken  or  else  the  Cracken  will  destroy  everyone  in  Joppa.  Having  a  sollution  to  the  situation,  they  decide  to  head  north  across  the  desert  far  away  to  where  the  Stigen  witches  live,  who  have  a  craving  for  human  flesh.  When  Perseus  heard  a  gurgling  noise  coming  from  the  pot  while  entering  their  tavern  he  knew  he  had  to  be  cautious.  &  had  Booboo  the  golden  owl  who  has  weird  like  eyes  that  spin  &  is  has  a  golden  color,  his  newfound  friend  he  found  in  the  desert,  take  the  eye  a  round  crystal  ball  away  from  the  Stigen  witches.  He  said  I'll  give  it  back  to  you  on  one  condition  first  tell  me  how  I  must  defeat  the  Cracken?  An  army  cannot  kill  him.  Seek  Medusa,  Medusa  was  Punished  by  one  of  the  Gods  as  well.  &  has  snake  like  hair.  One  look  from  her  will  turn  any  living  creature  into  stone!  &  amongst  some  of  the  toughest  danger  for  Perseus.  Refusing  to  get  too  close  to  the  Stigen  witches  Perseus  throws  the  eye  in  another  part  of  the  room.  &  reaches  the  river  of  death  a  days  journey  away.  &  he  must  cross  the  river  to  get  to  the  Island  where  Medusa  resides.  Thallo  tells  him  here  you'll  need  this  coin  for  ferron  the  ferry  man.  I  liked  that  costume  by  the  way.  A  skeleton  that  can  move.  &  had  a  real  narrow  boat.  Next  Perseus  faces  the  2  headed  dog.  &  tells  his  Greek  warriors  remember  if  you  must  see  her  use  your  shield.  Her  reflection  cannot  harm  you.  She  kills  2  of  the  warriors  with  her  bow  &  arrow.  &  almost  never  misses.  Perseus  looses  his  shield  &  has  to  use  his  instinct  or  his  Wits  to  get  Medusa.  &  he  does.
&  they  get  one  last  encounter  with  Calibos,  Who  kills  2  of  them  Thallo  &  the  other  guy,  &  whips  Perseus  but  is  unable  to  be  victorious  over  him.  Perseus  stabs  him  with  his  sword.  Calibos  was  evil  &  pretty  much  as  bad  as  all  the  other  nasty  monsters  in  this  movie.  They  fought  huge  scorpions  who  grew  quickly  after  Medusa's  head  had  been  poked  by  Calibose's  fork  hand.  From  Medusa's  Poisonous  blood.  I  liked  all  these  monsters  in  this  movie  except  maybe  Calibos.  I  liked  BooBoo  the  owl  &  Perseus  understood  what  he  was  saying,  &  Peagasus.  I  don't  know  what  kind  of  special  effects  they  used  when  Arggos  was  destroyed  by  the  Cracken.  But  that  was  an  interesting  part  of  the  movie.
The  Cracken  gets  Conquered  &  Joppa  is  saved.  Perseus  has  won  Zeus  said,  &  him  &  Andromida  will  have  a  good  marriage  &  a  happy  life.  One  of  the  other  Goddess's  asks  what  if  someday  there  will  be  others  Like  Perseus.
Zeus  says  it'll  no  longer  be  needed.  But  Perseus's  name  will  be  remembered.  I  thought  it  was  a  good  movie.  Good  monsters.  Good  everything!  One  who  never  failed  with  anything!",1413417600,,5695,4.375418994413407

Having always been drawn to Greek myths, I was very excited to see one presented on the big screen in full color with characters that I had first come to know only in books using my imagination to picture them as vividly as I could. Clash Of The Titans amazed and thrilled my senses as I watched it for the first time in the movie theater and numerous times later on over the years. Of course, film technology has made leaps and bounds since the making of this film--the 2010 remake of Clash Of The Titans is an even greater spectacle with superior effects--but I continue to enjoy watching the original, as I still have a deep appreciation for the film's unique visual style and many talented, veteran actors.",1401667200,3,866,4.41875

So, I timed when this scene comes up and covered the projector lens for 40 sec to be safe.

Excalibur is just better all the way around.  Conceptually, this has some great potential, but bad acting, subpar effects and a some shoddy direction make this feel weaker than it should; but maybe Im just being overly judgmental, since so many seem to love this.  I haven't seen the remake, and I have no desire to, but I can see how updated visuals would make this more effective.  Still, the makeup work is pretty solid here and for lovers of the genre, this is certainly a benchmark film.

807990,5,6304111231,"Straight to the point folks, I would recommend you acquire a copy of this gem.  It is a feel good movie, with no CGI.
What's so nice about Titans?  It  is, good old fashion movie making, people doing it, not computer graphics.  CGI has its place in movie productions, computer generated images, but in a Harryhausen production, not so.

The late Mr Harryhausen's legacy of hands on storytelling goes back to Mighty Joe Young, his military short films, and fairy tales he made.  I had the good fortune of seeing him in 2008 and his films showcased on TCM turner classic movies.  I recorded the entire evening. Clash Of The Titans in my opinion should not be viewed by young children.  There are some intense graphic violent scenes, it might give them nightmares.  For everyone else, get your popcorn, soft drinks, and settle in for a exciting journey in the world of Greek Mythology and Ray Harryhausen.",1390867200,,902,4.694267515923567
807991,5,6304111231,"I remember watching this film as a kid back in the 80s. My entire family loves mythology, especially Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology, so over the years, I've watched this classic many times. Lately, my nine-year-old has been caught up in the Percy Jackson series of books and film adaptations, and as much as they are fun and based on elements of Greek mythology, I wanted my daughter to have a more in-depth knowledge of Greek mythology, so we've been reading books on the subject and of course, I had to show her this film.

The film itself is a classic and although grossly outdated by today's standards, it holds its own, imbuing a sense of nostalgia (for those of us who grew up watching this film) and also a sense of wonder for how wonderfully the film brings to life stories from Greek mythology. It features a wonderful cast of characters starring some big names such as Sir Laurence Olivier as supreme Greek god Zeus who casts a benevolent eye upon his demigod son Perseus, conceived with a mortal woman (Zeus had impregnated Perseus' mom, Danae by visiting her in the form of a shower of gold. Those Greek gods had their way with mortal women in various guises, and were quite creative in going about it too!). Perseus is portrayed by Harry Hamlin, who looks the part although his acting leaves much to be desired. There's Maggie Smith who plays Goddess Thetis, goddess of water (although by some accounts she is a sea nymph), who is enraged at Zeus' kindness towards Perseus when her own son, Calibos was cursed to become a monster when he crossed the gods.

The story follows Perseus' journey to seek his destiny, which he finds in battling various monsters such as the Gorgon Medusa, Calibos, and the Kraken, among others, in order to secure the hand of Andromeda, daughter of Queen Cassiopeia.

There's lots of monsters, and dramatic scenes here that make these tales of mythology come alive and my daughter was riveted from beginning till end. She did comment on how some of the effects seemed rather strange, for example, she felt the vulture depicted carrying off Andromeda's soul to Calibos was not very authentic. Oh well, at least she enjoyed the story. Truth be told, I have watched the 2010 version of Clash of the Titans and was completely underwhelmed. It was just lots of CGI and not much storytelling, and I have always preferred the latter.

One complain I have about this DVD edition is that the sound quality leaves much to be desired. I had to turn up the volume on my TV almost to the max to be able to listen to the dialogue. The picture quality too was merely serviceable, but I guess for 5 dollars, I shouldn't expect too much.

The effects work is pretty good for a film of its age, sure its not entirely convincing but it looks mythical.

There is no denying the palpable sense of nostalgia watching a flick made with techniques at the time of its release that are almost fifty years old.  But who cares if the film works, right?  Now then, this adventure hits its stride early and keeps its lively pace to the thrilling conclusion.  While the fantasy genre is often guilty of convoluted plots, ""Clash Of The Titans"" avoids this trend because of the screenplay by Beverley Cross which maintains its focus on its simple premise.  In terms of making a good picture, it doesn't hurt to have onboard veteran actors like Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith and Burgess Meredith either.  Overall, this is a solid ride through Greek mythology, young romance and brave combat.  In hindsight, it is interesting how many fantasy films were produced in the early 1980's such as ""Excalibur"" (1981), ""Dragonslayer"" (1981), ""Conan The Barbarian"" (1982), ""Time Bandits"" (1981), ""The Dark Crystal"" (1982), ""The Neverending Story"" (1984) and ""Krull"" (1983) - just to name a few.

808359,5,6304111231,"Mythology is the legacy of centuries gone by. And the original movie, Clash of the Titans, is a classic example of this type of mythology. This movie is a film adaptation of the myth of Perseus and his quest to battle both Medusa and the Kraken monster to save the Princess Andromeda. Please permit me to present the movie plot in perspective: Perseus (played by Harry Hamlin) is the mortal son and favoured son of the immortal god Zeus (played by Laurence Olivier), who unwittingly ticked off the angered sea goddess, Thetis (played by Maggie Smith). The angry goddess then tries to hinder the path of Perseus in his quest assigned by the immortal Zeus. To make matters worse, Perseus falls in love with the lovely Princess Andromeda (played by Judi Bowker), who was engaged to the son of the angry goddess. Perseus is soon off on one quest after another - with Zeus helping, Thetis hindering, and lots of innocent characters getting stabbed, drowned, and squished along the way. Perseus must solve a riddle and win the hand of the beautiful Andromeda and must defeat her former betrothed Calibos, the son of Thetis, who has been turned into a monster. With the help of the poet Ammon (played by Burgess Meredith) and a robot owl, Perseus must also catch and tame the winged horse Pegasus, overcome giant scorpions and 2-headed monstrous dogs, and behead the evil Medusa, all in an attempt to stop his new bride, Andromeda, from being sacrificed to the giant sea creature known as the Kraken.

Clash of the Titans features the work of legendary special effects master Ray Harryhausen. His visual effects were, and still are, the high point of this movie, with the Medusa sequence truly the delightful high point. His old-fashioned stop-motion animation reached a new complexity in this movie, which catapulted his fantastic imagination and expertise to bringing to (DVD) moviegoers a truly unfiltered movie magic - one of the last true testaments to a dying art form. To me, all these special effects make Clash of the Titans a magical and marvelous movie. It displays certain nostalgic qualities that make it appealing both to kids and adults alike. And best of all --- they're all vintage! This movie is truly one of the few examples of the timeless appeal of mythical tales inspired by stories of heroic valor that have survived over the centuries.  A gorgeous movie score also enhances the tale, blending perfectly with the sweeping story with grace and elegance.

At 66 years of age, I still thoroughly enjoy watching Clash of the Titans every once in a while. It helps me become nostalgic - ""a child once again"" - with the timeless appeal of the mythical tales and conflicts between immortal gods and goddesses, a flying winged horse, scary giant scorpions and 2-headed monstrous dogs, a sea monster (Kraken) and, of course, the sinister Medusa and her head of snakes. Best of all, Clash of the Titans ends with a nostalgic beauty that makes it a treasured film, especially for those who are fortunate enough to see it through the discriminating eyes of a child.

One word of advice:  Parents need to know that this movie is based on Greek mythology. Although it is aimed at young audiences, it contains medium-level fantasy violence, some scary sequences - gruesome witches that share an eyeball, Medusa and her snake-hair, a skeletal ferryman, and some ""unexplored nudity"".  On the other hand, modern day kids may find it all a bit slow and/or dull, but those who saw it when it was first released in the early 1980s may be thrilled to see it again (and again).",1367020800,,3570,4.796747967479675

808457,5,6304111231,"I was lucky enough to see this movie in a theater when it was first released.  Ive held a certain fondness for it ever since.

(It should be noted, my review is based on the product that was released in 2002, the snap case version featuring the illustration of the blue Kraken on its cover.  I decided against upgrading to the Blu-ray version based on the reviews posted here.)
Out of all Ray Harryhausen films, this one has the distinction of a truly all-star cast.  Starring such incredible luminaries as Laurence Olivier, Sian Phillips, Flora Robson, Maggie Smith, Burgess Meredith, and Ursula Andress.  Alongside them are more of Harryhausens fantastic creations: Medusa, the Kraken, giant scorpions, the canine Dioskilos.  The story is based on myths, which gives it a good solid foundation on which to build this tale.  Theres a hero (played a bit stiffly by Harry Hamlin) and a damsel in distress and undress (Judi Bowker).  Theres also a trio of witches and no end of petulant goddesses not afraid to defy Zeus at every turn in the story.  Naturally, theres a journey, a quest, a deadline to find a way of killing the Kraken.  Its all very charming and exciting, it harkens back to a time when storytelling in movies was very grand with principles.  Ive often wondered if that was the reason Ray Harryhausen prematurely retired from the industry.  His films have never really been recognized or appreciated by the movie industry until long after the fact.  Its hard to believe your work is relevant when your peers fail to acknowledge it until decades later in an oh-by-the-way special award for services rendered.  Ive always thought that was criminal, to my knowledge, the man was never nominated for an Oscar for any of his work.

If nothing else, Ray Harryhausen can take note of the fact that millions of people do love his work.  Every movie of his thats been released on DVD, I have and treasure.",1362528000,,1911,4.745454545454545

It was my first introduction as a kid to Greek epics, and I was hooked... been a Hellenic pantheon buff ever since.

Keep in mind that this was made in the early 1980's, before the advent of high tech cinematography we come to expect in modern movies... it's certainly not as packed with special effects as the 2010 version.  Regardless of it's hilariously tragic stop-motion animated Pegasus, Medusa, and Kraken, you forget all this when you see the scrap metal avian creature whose eyes are spinning sprockets.  I wanna know the amount of sheer will power it took that acting crew not to crack up in the middle of scenes with that ""Bird of Stealth""!

This version stacks up to something much more when compared to the 2010 version.  Better plot progression, characters are more likable, and there are so many more nuggets in this film that nod to the original Greek hero story that it just blows that other eye-candy reliant 2010 version out of the water.

808617,2,6304111231,"I have to say that my generation came to age as the electronic industry blew wide open and I could only remember formats changing so fast that you'd get into one and then another would come out and there you went to buy 'only the good movies' on the new format winding up to finally replacing them with the new format and then it would happen again and even though you said you weren't going to do it...there you'd go, buying the best and again replacing most of your library to the new format. I am a product of the electronic 80's which was wonderful to be part of because of its leaps and bounds, but dismal in ALL the money you wasted every few years buying the same things over again on the new format! And you'd say to yourself never again...and boom! another one. I LOVED this movie more than anything and I could remember getting my first VCR and of course buying some great movies and making copies of the rest...but you didn't care because you'd have to use the SP speed to get the best quality and compared to today's standards, that was not good, but it was back then. And don't forget about the bouncing back and forth between Beta & VHS.

Then for a blip of a few years there was the CED (for those of you who might remember) which was greater clarity but lost out to the fact you couldn't record on it (it was the video analog pressed on vinyl) and there I'd go, running to replace my favorite movies like this one. The drawback, since it was on vinyl, it could skip like a record...lol and believe me, it was funny to watch sometimes. That didn't last long before Laser came onto the scene and that was really good compared to all the rest! You couldn't record still, but the picture was superb for its time a whopping 480 lines of resolution...wow! So you'd say to yourself, now this is it and you run out buying all your favorites and more, and AGAIN replacing your library. And you didn't mind because films like this were worth it this time. And I would have to say that this stayed a while and you would look down on people who still bought movies like Clash on VHS.

You got a rest for a bit then bam, DVD comes along. The digital age had arrived to video almost a decade after digital audio. Now you had 720 lines of resolution and that blew Laser Discs away (which were lasers, but analog) and EVERYTHING looked better. So off you went thinking that this was it and it couldn't go further and didn't for quite some time and you never saw your 'Clash of the Titans' any better and it didn't for about a decade. Then along comes blu ray (which beat out HD) and gave you 1080 lines of resolution which truly amazed you more. But again that meant going back to replace your favorites, but at least you had a decade to recover from a tumultuous decade of change. Now the difference is NOT the technology holding us back from amazing videos, it was the transfer process that made or broke a good movie like this! Now we have an industry that can't go very much further than they have with clarity. Oh sure, they can always get a little better, but after that, the next best thing is to be there...lol. So now you have an industry that has to make its money in creative ways, the 80's and early 90's were gone. No more money coming in waves draining the people out of replacing their libraries once again because they are always in a down state unless something picks up the profits again. So here's where 'special editions' come into play...and 'extended versions', uncut, deluxe, ultimate...and on and on. THAT is how they are soaking up peoples money once again. the never ending stream of a new special something is coming out. I know I'm one of the many that have different versions and/or packaging of my favorite movies. You also now get the DVD through at you for a few bucks more than just blu ray. I also know that a lot of you have more than one version of your movie, I know I have about 3 different 'Avatar' disc sets!

After writing this whole thing, I had to lead you down to this point and it had to be shown graphically WHY we get short changed on a fantastic movie like ""Clash of the Titans"" and RH's other great works, not to mention the others. Oh, they are listening to you, don't think they aren't. But unless it can bring in enough profit to warrant the effort and time for a better 'version', they won't do it and you'll get substandard releases like this. It's a shame that we have an industry that doesn't care about quality...oh maybe for the 'special effects' but of quality of the work produced. They care about the dollar amounts and the sums of what any effort will take. You won't get a better release of Clash, or any other badly transferred movie UNTIL you can show them they can make a handsome profit...otherwise, I'm afraid we're all going to suffer from it.

That's my two cents worth. Does anyone out there still need a CED player...cheap!",1351036800,,4895,4.352297592997812

808673,5,6304111231,"Sweeping, romantic and decidedly old-fashioned, the great Ray Harryhausen's cinematic swan song, CLASH OF THE TITANS remains a film that ought to enchant both fans and younger viewers unfamiliar with its magical sense of derring-do.

Released in a busy summer packed with more technologically advanced fantasies like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Superman II,"" Harryhausen, producer Charles H. Schneer and director Desmond Davis' ""Titans"" nevertheless held its own at the box-office, becoming a favorite among genre aficionados and particularly younger viewers. As I can attest, having been not quite 7 when the movie was released, ""Clash of the Titans"" was a film I watched endlessly growing up; even though I was raised on ""Star Wars,"" I never found the stop-motion special effects outdated or anything less than ""special,"" even if the picture, ultimately, marked the end of an era for its style of genre storytelling.

It's not always easy to go back to one of your childhood favorites, as once in a while you can come away disappointed, but I can honestly say ""Clash of the Titans"" more than holds its own when compared to today's more serious and technologically advanced -- but far less fun -- blockbusters. This was a film clearly aimed at family audiences, managing to satisfy the young and young at heart, as they say, with its fairy-tale aspects and thrilling set-pieces, which again, hold up quite well.

Part of the reason why the film remains enchanting is in the conviction of its story and filmmaking. Beverly Cross' tale of the heroic Perseus (Harry Hamlin), fighting to save a princess (the quite fetching Judi Bowker) from the likes of the vile Calibos, the terrifying Medusa and giant Kraken -- all the while being the pawn in a chess game amongst the Gods, including father Zeus (Laurence Olivier) - enables Harryhausen to craft a succession of brilliantly realized creatures, as well as engage the audience in an entertaining and episodic quest through Greek mythology. While much has been made over the years about the picture's so-called ""plastic"" performances, the assembled cast was certainly atypical for one of Harryhausen's productions. From Olivier to Maggie Smith, Claire Bloom, Ursula Andress and Sian Phillips, the performances are serious and mannered but suit the material splendidly, while Burgess Meredith's sage presence equally aids in the adventure, the veteran actor essaying a playwright who thinks Perseus' quest might make for an exciting story. Hamlin and Bowker, meanwhile, are also just fine, particularly when you match them up with the completely cardboard leads of Saturday matinee adventures from years gone by.

It also helps that Laurence Rosenthal's score is so utterly gorgeous that it seems to age like a fine wine. Lyrical, heartfelt and stirring, Rosenthal's music carries the entire picture, culminating in a finale every bit as delectable now as it was then. Rosenthal might have been the third man in following the likes of John Barry (whose name adorns the credits of the one-sheet poster still in the Blu-Ray's Digibook packaging) and John Williams, but it's hard to imagine any other score working as effectively as Rosenthal's now-classic outing does.

THE VIDEO:

Warner's Blu-Ray release of CLASH has been maligned by a lot of viewers, but it's not entirely as bad as you might've heard. After a disappointing DVD release several years ago -- marked by a horribly compressed, tinny-sounding stereo soundtrack -- Warner has made amends with a satisfying high-definition mastering that's only hindered by variances inherent in its source material.

Viewers unfamiliar with the movie may likely be surprised at how varied its elements appear, but as most fans of the picture will attest, there are limits with what you can do with remastering ""Clash of the Titans"" given the amount of optical effects (blue screen, matte paintings, etc.) it contains. There are times when it's jarring to go from a basically pristine shot to one that's riddled with grain -- but it's typically because there's a process shot or some kind of optical effect involved.

That said, ""Clash"" exhibits a distinctly film-like appearance, complete with varying degrees of grain. It would've been easy for Warner to go the ""digital noise reduction"" route here and try to smooth over the movie's rough edges by applying lots of DNR, but thankfully they've avoided that temptation and produced as clear and vibrant an HD rendering as ""Clash of the Titans"" allows. Colors are strong and there are details present that none of the movie's prior, uneven video releases rendered. Viewers might feel disappointed still, yet they have to understand that films shot with so many optical effects from decades past are simply never going to look as pristine and flawless as they'd like.

On the audio side, the DTS Master Audio presentation isn't overpowering -- offering a simple 2.0 stereo mix -- while the supplemental package is a disappointment, leaving off the trailer, and including just a 12-minute videotaped interview with Harryhausen from the initial DVD release as well as a few extra snippets with the F/X pioneer. (The Digibook package also includes a mini-photo booklet of the ""Titans"" remake plus a discount movie voucher for the remake -- but not valid until a week after the film's opening day!).

That said, this is nevertheless as exciting and satisfying an edition of ""Clash of the Titans"" as one could expect to see on Blu-Ray.",1337817600,5,5475,5.114093959731544
808674,5,6304111231,"The 2010 remake has some things going for it, but this 1981 original has all the heart. The dialogue of the immortals is great - grouchy, conniving, pleading, jealous!  And the actors they got for them - WOW! Sir Laurence Olivier was sick at the time, but I think that lends a wistfulness to Zeus' pronouncements. Maggie Smith as Thetis and Claire Bloom as Hera kept the scenes from being too campy. For the mortals, Harry Hamlin does pretty well considering some of his dialogue is doofus, but Burgess Meredith steals the show. Well, except for when he's sharing the scene with Bubo the mechanical owl!

The Extra #2 interview isn't long, but it's interesting. Ray Harryhausen was co-producer, along with Charles Schneer, so he was involved with every aspect of this movie. He talks about why he wanted to make this film, European locations used, music, and the actors.

His biggest influences, he says, were effects pioneer Willis O'Brien and the illustrations of Gustav Dore.

Extra #3 has Harryhausen's additional comments, accompanied by outtakes, on Calibos, Pegasus, Bubo, the Scorpions, Medusa, the Kraken and Dioskilos. These were short, but also fun to listen to. What I didn't know is that both Kraken and Dioskilos were made up names for the movie. I knew Cerberus was a 3-headed dog from the Greeks (or Fluffy, from Harry Potter), and I just assumed Dioskilos was a 2-headed dog I hadn't heard of. Nope. Harryhausen and crew simply thought that three heads would be too clumsy to make, and they made up the name.

I join all the other people recommending this movie.

808675,4,6304111231,"OK, Ray Harryhausen's special effects look pretty hokey next to modern computer graphics, but if you can just forget that part, this is a pretty well-done movie, pretty faithful to the ancient story.

Perseus (a hunk named Harry Hamlin) is the son which Zeus (Laurence Olivier) fathered on Cassiopeia (Sian Phillips) in a golden shower. (Shut up, Dr. Freud!) He's the one who rescued Andromeda (Judi Bowker, whom you may remember from ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon,"" where she played St. Claire) from the Kraken. Perseus is assisted in his endeavors by the playwright Ammon (Burgess Meredith), and by gifts from three goddesses: a sword from Aphrodite (Ursula Andress), a helmet from Athena (Susan Fleetwood), and a shield from Hera (Claire Bloom). When the helmet which has the power to make him invisible is lost, Athena sends him a mechanical version of her beloved owl, Bubo. He's the one who steals the show, in my opinion.

And of course, there is Pegasus, whose wings seem way too short and almost clipped to carry his own weight, let alone with Perseus on his back. I notice they're much better in the picture on the DVD cover. Apparently the artist knew the one in the movie was not aerodynamically valid.

808761,4,6304111231,"As an English Major, I had to read a lot of Greek Mythology. So, granted I am a little biased. But I really consider this a classic.

WARNING: I should point out that if you are looking for complete accuracy, you're going to be disappointed. But that said, this movie is really great and worthy of the classic label.

Very quickly, Zeus finds out that his son and lover of his (the mother of that son) have been locked into a trunk by the lover's father and thrown into the sea. So Zeus of course takes his revenge. Then we find out that Zeus (for legitimate reasons) inflicts punishment on Calibos (the son of the sea goddess Thetis). So, naturally she wants revenge. So she inflicts Zeus's son with difficulties.

It boils down to that the disputes between the gods and goddesses find their way onto earth. And this leads to a long (but interesting journey) of trials and adventures.

Harry Hamlin is wonderful as Zeus's son. (Brave and daring, but yet still very human.) Burgess Meredith is very likable as the wise man who helps Hamlin. Maggie Smith is memorable as the goddess who feels hurt by Zeus and looks for a chance to get even, but yet she can still confront her son with an objective question: ""Justice or revenge?"" Hera is decent in that she holds a grudge against Zeus for the affair, but still does his illegitimate son the courtesy of bestowing upon him the gift of a divine shield.

Oh, and let's not forget Sir Laurence Olivier as Zeus. Even though he was very ill at the time, he delivered a great performance and carried the power, authority, and even the humanity of Zeus.

One of my few complaints is that Maggie Smith's evil son is just a little too evil. He could have been fleshed out with some redeeming points. Also, when all is happy, it's sad to think that so many people suffered and died all JUST BECAUSE Andromeda's stupid mother had to open her big mouth and brag of her treasures being greater than those of Thetis the goddess of the sea.

But that said, it's a great film. And just try not crying a little when Zeus gives his final speech about how: ""Even if we the gods are abandonned or forgotten, the stars will never fail. They will burn until the end of time.""

May the gods and goddesses of Greece reign eternal!",1311120000,4,2255,4.443099273607748

808846,3,6304111231,"At the time regarded as a disappointment but now something of a minor classic whose reputation seems to have grown massively in the wake of its recent very loose remake, the original 1981 version of Clash of the Titans is far from the best of the Ray Harryhausen fantasy adventures. A lavish retelling of the Perseus and Andromeda myth with an ill-assorted all-star cast who mostly give the impression of slumming it - Laurence Olivier, Burgess Meredith, Maggie Smith, Claire Bloom, Ursula Andress, Flora Robson and a pre-L.A. Law Harry Hamlin - it drew unfavourable comparisons with Jason and the Argonauts on its original release and was overshadowed by the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark that Summer, but now its reputation seems safely assured in the memories of those who saw it often enough in their childhood to ensure its profitability.

Part of the appeal of Harryhausen's films, and the reason the special effects man is regarded as their auteur rather than their generally forgotten directors or his undervalued producer Charles H. Schneer, is their hand-crafted nature. The effects were never photo-realistic, but they created their own sense of magic even if the creatures were always in much sharper focus than the grainy live-action background shots. Despite having the biggest budget of any of his pictures - a then massive $15m that allowed Harryhausen to have assistants for the only time in his career - it has some of the weakest special effects in any Harryhausen film. The stop motion animation is still excellent, particularly Steve Archer's work on the flying horse Perseus, but the integration and compositing is often very poor, giving thick blue outlines to many of the `mythologicals' or setting them against especially grainy live action footage. As a film it's not at all bad, but as a swansong for one of the greatest special effects men of them all it does leave something to be desired.

It has that post-Star Wars problem of the obligatory robot sidekick, in this case a whirring mechanical owl that looks and sounds like something Oliver Postgate created for The Clangers, and despite having a fine cinematographer in Bond movie regular Ted Moore, the film has that flat, diffused and somewhat pallid look so many late-70s and early-80s films suffer from. While never as lethargic as Sam Wanamaker's pallid direction on Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, Desmond Davis' direction is for the most part perfunctory and uninspired, only springing to life in the atmospheric scene in Medusa's lair or the grand finale, but it does have a strong script (despite screenwriter Beverley Cross' wife Maggie Smith's comments dismissal it as a bit of rubbish) and the design of the film is often pleasingly inspired by both the Fairbanks and Korda versions of The Thief of Bagdad - the shots of Perseus riding Pegasus across the skyline of Joppa could come right off the poster of the silent version. It's a look that may have made it a little anachronistic on first release but now gives it an old world movie charm that makes it look a lot less dated than many of its contemporaries. And at its best it does recapture a sense of wonder that makes it repaying a return visit: it's not one of the all-time great fantasies despite the material, but it is an enjoyable one.

The DVD release has an acceptable but unspectacular transfer that the poor BluRay release completely fails to improve on, with only an interview with Harryhausen as extra.",1301270400,,3470,4.887945670628183
808847,5,6304111231,"Clash of the Titans is one of those movies that, as a kid, you just kept watching whenever it was on TV.  Special effects by Ray Harryhausen, with stars such as Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, and Ursula Andress, a good solid story, monsters, Gods, witches, how can you miss?
And there is a solid story - Perseus wants to save his love, save the day.  But he is really doing it for love - and the wealth and power he will gain?  Well, that is just frosting on the cake.
The characters are right out of myth - Medusa, Pegasus, Kraken, Dioskilos...wait, I don't remember that one being from Greek Myth?  And the Kraken is in the wrong part of the world.  Lets face facts - the story always comes first.  But at least this version has a story that makes some sense.
True, I found some mistakes funny.  Like when Perseus starts out for the Isle of the Dead, he had two soldiers.  But when he gets to the other side there seem to be three with him.
The DVD has a few extras.  A feature on Ray Harryhausen and a section on the Myths and Monsters.  In the end it's the movie that REALLY grabs your notice and there is tons of thrills and spills.

808849,4,6304111231,"Clash of the Titans(released June/81)is the 2010 re-release of the movie,the last one being in 2002. This film features the last collaboration of the Charles-Schneer-Harryhausen team and would be Harryhausen's swan song in films. The film was a bit on the long side and slow in its execution but Harryhausen's special effects,as always,shone through.
The story begins as the young mother of Perseus(impregnated by Zeus himself)and her baby Perseus are set adrift in a coffin to die. For punishment for this sacrilege Zeus(Lawrence Olivier) orders the city destroyed by a huge sea monster,the Kraken. While Perseus grows up into a strong lad there is  princess Andromeda(Judi Bowker)in a far off city that is having trouble getting hitched. She was set to marry Calibos,the son of the goddess Thetis(Maggie Smith).But Calibos committed many horrible acts and Zeus ordered him turned into a hideous monster and banished to a swamp outside the city Jappa. Calibos pines for Andromeda and the only way he can see her is to send nightly,a giant vulture with a cage to capture her spirit while she sleeps and bring it to him to gaze upon.
Meanwhile Perseus(Harry Hamlin)comes to Jappa and solves a riddle that all potential suitors must solve to win her hand. But Thetis won't let this slight to her son go by lightly and she orders Andromeda to be sacrificed to the Kraken. The only way the Kraken can be defeated is with the head of Medussa. Perseus with the aid of friend Ammon(Burgess Meredith)set out to obtain said head and run into many of an adventure along the way with the likes of Pegasus the winged horse,The Stygian Witches,a two headed dog and giant scorpions. Zeus aids Perseus in every way he can without trying to seem prejudice to the other gods,such as a gift of armour,weapons and a mechanical owl called Bubo to guide him in his quest.
Perseus gets across the river Styx and claims Medussa's head. He returns to Jappa just as Andromeda's sacrifice is underway. It's nip and tuck but Perseus finally is able to over power the Kraken and release his beloved,who live happily ever after.
This film was supposed to have a sequel originally but with the new computer enhanced special effects becoming more the norm the studios thought Harryhausen's methods a tad old fashioned and too expensive. That is a shame because we lost out on a great,great creative talent who still had many more years to give to the industry and the fans. However time has rightly heaped great rewards on Harryhausen and he has discovered that many of the newer and up and coming directors and producers of years gone by have cited him as being their inspiration;Lucas and Spielberg as the most obvious. Clash of the Titans is really a misnomer. It doesn't sound as good but it should have been called something more like ""The Arguments of the Titans"".The ""clashing"" is really just the gods arguing and bickering amongst each other as they manipulate the goings on of mortals down on earth. And what about that Kraken?To all you Harryhausen fans,doesn't he look an awfully like the alien monster in 20 Million Miles to Earth? This one swims while the other walked. And what about the newer version of the Titans? Forget it,this one is still the best.
While there is no where on this keepscase that says this is a remastered version I can only compare the 2002 version to this and immediately I see a difference in quality;much,much clearer and crisp. And this just makes sense as it is competing with the newer version. The extras include the trailer,a gallery of the monsters in the film and a nice little interview with Harryhausen himself. It's in its original widescreen a/r.
All in all while the plot doesn't move as well as it might this film is Harryhausen's swan song and he goes all out inventing a plethora of mythical creatures for our delight. The Kraken is quite ominous but the fight with Medussa is a classic moment and wins as the best creature here,for my money. Bubo wins the cutesy award in this film. The film is loaded with high priced talent which makes up for the leading man's lack of it;Hamlin was just a pretty face and nothing much more.

Seriously, they couldn't even make a 5.1 soundtrack for it?  If you have this on DVD do not waste your money on the Blu-Ray.  If you want to check out an action/adventure movie from the 80's with a great Blu-Ray transfer, check out Flash Gordon on Blu-Ray.  I got the Flash Gordon Blu-Ray the same time as the Clash of the Titans Blu-Ray and the Flash Gordon disk clearly shows the improvements that are possible on Blu-Ray.  I am very disappointed in Clash of the Titans on Blu-Ray.  I give the movie itself 5 stars, but the Blu-Ray transfer 1 star, so 3 stars overall for this disk.  I do want to add, that if you do not own this movie on DVD at all, then it is probably worth getting on Blu-Ray for the story alone, but don't expect a crystal clear picture or 5.1 sound.

The acting and pacing is inept and the special effects laughable - or is that what they're supposed to be like? The most amusing moment is when the kraken appears from behind the cliffs and his three claw-like hands appear one by one.

I concur with another two star reviewer here who stated that the pegasus looks like a cardboard cutout that was pasted onto the background. For a movie that appeared around the time of Star Wars the special effects are not even close to matching the realism of the sci-fi classic.

Other low rating reviewers here state that the reason for the clunky special effects is due to the transfer to dvd. If this is the case then why have all the other features of the movie transferred well but not the special effects?

I hired this movie after watching the 2010 rendition as people had opined that the original was much better. I'm glad I didn't watch this with friends - it would have made an awkward couple of hours viewing. Its only redeeming feature is the cute mechanical owl.

It takes some serious liberties with the old stories, not least a thread of atheism that sits badly with gods likely to drop in at any moment.

No matter, it's more than fair entertainment, with savable maidens, mighty battles, monsters to slay, and anachronisms to parade across the screen. The early-eighties effects have held up well, even by today's high standards. Pop some popcorn, put the mythology experts on mute, and sit back. It's a fair yarn, as long as you don't take it too seriously.

809031,2,6304111231,"Okay, I really like this movie and have since 1981 when it was theatrically released.  It's not my favorite Harryhausen fantasy but it's in my top 5.

I ordered this blu-ray from Amazon.com a week or so ago and it just arrived today.  This is where I kick myself in the head for not reading other's reviews of the blu-ray first.  The transfer sucks BIG TIME or, perhaps it was just the elements used to create this blu-ray that were a mixed bag!  Most (not all) of the daylight scenes were excellent but the evening and night scenes were truly horrid.  From the opening scenes of the soldiers on the sandy beach right up to the end titles all I could see were large chunks of dirt that wasn't removed prior to making the transfer.  Way too much film grain (much more than should be for a film of this age) and artifacts throughout.. all this clearly visible in the darker and some of the daylight scenes viewed on a 65 inch HD LED TV.

It seems the studios are really getting lazy (or is it just cheap?) in releasing newer and older films in substandard transfers.

I can name on perhaps 1 hand the films I feel are really superb transfers to blu-ray. Another 25 to 30 that are good and all the rest (approx 985 in my collection) as dismal failures as far as the quality of the transfers.  I invested in Blu-ray for the promised superb quality this new format offered and to be honest I feel cheated MOST of the time to the point where I'm not going to be buying blu-rays based on how much I like/love the film but more importantly how good the quality of the transfer is.  It's just a slap in the face from the studios to wait for them to make one of my favorites available on blu-ray and to be let down once again by a skanky presentation.

Two other blu-rays of recent note that I have had problems with (Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan) have been recalled by the studios for faulty transfers because we consumers bombarded them with complaints.  I don't expect that to happen in this case because compared to the two just mentioned, CLASH is an older film with (I'm guessing) nowhere the amount of fans.

So if you really like this film and have a TV larger than 40 inches I'd stay away from this title.  However if your TV is smaller and don't expect to be buying a larger one in the next couple of years, then go ahead and buy it coz you probably won't be able to see the deficits in the transfer.

And for all of you who won't be buying this blu-ray, do check out two other Harryhausen films (The 7th Voyage of Sinbad and Jason and the Argonauts) on blu-ray coz they look really GREAT.  Sony 10 / Warner 2

809034,5,6304111231,"Preferences between the 1981 and 2010 versions appear to generally be based upon the generational differences.  The majority of the younger viewers (30 and younger) swear that the 2010 version is worlds better than the 1981 version yet most of the older viewers stand by Ray Harryhausen's last production.  Mind boggling?  Not really.

It's not difficult to see why.  The latest version is typical of current special effects-based action movies.  The pacing is fast, there are loud explosive noises for everything short of a fart and dizzying graphics to distract you from concentrating on a screenplay that suffers from major discontinuities and inappropriate costumes (since when did Zeus wear armor rather than a robe?).  Interestingly, another reviewer pointed out that the plot was unimportant anyway because audiences really pay to see the newer and much better special effects.  Really??!!!  I always thought that if you wanted to see special effects on par with the new Clash of The Titans without thinking about a plot you could just play an XBOX or PS3 game through your home theater in the comfort of your own home.  In fact, I'm shocked that more people haven't noticed that the new Medusa moves and looks like an artificial game character that moves like the '82 Centipede at the old arcades.

Don't get me wrong.  The movement of the new monsters are definitely smoother and more convincingly natural overall than the old stop-motion animated monsters.  But the motion is still a little smoother than you'd expect from reality and when you'd expect something to vary its speed, it's usually just one speed throughout its full range of motion.  Also, Medusa in the new version doesn't look realistic enough to touch.  On the other hand, the new scorpions look totally realistic.  Unfortunately, like the Medusa, harpies, and other creatures, the new monsters move at such a dizzying pace that the action unnecessarily loses its realism (typical of movies that use visual effects as crutches).

The old Ray Harryhausen effects are definitely primitive for current day standards for their somewhat jerky motion.  But you will immediately notice that it's sufficient for the purpose of the movie, which is ultimately to tell you a story that actually makes sense even if it doesn't follow Greek mythology to a T.  The 1981 Clash of The Titans will appeal to older viewers because they grew up watching movies with pacing that is not rushed for the sake of exciting them because of a lack of story logic (Why did Zeus decide to destroy Argos then give fighting tips to Perseus to save its people???)

On the subject of picture detail.  It's true that the original '81 lacks the detailed punch of most newer movies but to make the most of this movie (or any other), you cannot rely on the default factory settings of whatever display you are using.  If you properly adjust the picture controls of your TV to its proper settings using a calibration DVD or Blu Ray disc, you'll get a decent quality picture from the Blu Ray version as well as the regular DVD version.  This also means turn off your anti-motion blur circuit if you have an LCD or LED backlit LCD to avoid watching movies with a home video look, make sure your contrast and black levels are set correctly.  If you've done all this, then you're good to go.  If you're using a plasma set, then you don't even need to worry about color, tint, and black level shifts when you sit away from a seat at a dead center position.",1278806400,14,3490,4.80569514237856

I do haft to say something though, PG?!?!?!? PG?!?!?! I UNDERSTAND PG-13 WASN'T AROUND BUT SERIOUSLY! [For Example: Naked Breasts.] I felt like this could have been R-Rated. Oh well, I probably sound like your mother right now [ZING!]

Most people say that the Kraken is the monster of the movie, and, I'd haft to say he's awesome but...I like the Vultures and the Scorpions a little better I don't know why. Maybe the Vulture has some better sound effects I dunno. But they are all great, stop-motion effects are awesome. The only thing better is a guy in a costume, now THAT'S where it's at. But I understand that it may be hard to get an actor to act like a monster.

The movie has that effect that makes you think all sorts of things, but all you hear inside your mind is ""..."". I believe the best movies are the ones that numb your mind. This one is the classic fantasy adventure monster movie brawl of heroic *SLAPS HIMSELF* (Ca$hman, you are sounding too much like a commercial for this movie.)

The only thing lacking is the acting, and don't think I'm giving it no justice, this was 1981, they could have done better. Maybe not humongous amount better but at least a little better. I like the ending, directors and script writers can play with movies that take place centuries before, tell us what we already know, but in a way that slaps us in the face and says ""LOOK AT YOU."" But then pats your face and says ""look at you.""

What a way too kick off your day (as I did.) But just an awesome movie in general, I've said what I need too say, and I'm suspecting the new one won't give it justice. But then, here's whats up: Watch it. For one reason or another, positive or negative, everyone hast to watch this movie.

The Rating? 4/5. Wasn't five/five just because this was 80's when it felt like 90's mixed with 50's. But, there ya go.

I'll have to check out the vhs one day, I guess.

But honestly, it's still a pretty weak film apart from the effects. The script is hammy, the acting except for Olivier is all b-grade, and the monsters couldn't hold a candle to Star Wars, made four years earlier. It's a kids' movie, all told, and while that's fun for kids and those who saw it as a kid and still worship it, as an adult watching it for the first time it all seemed pretty weak, and some of the lines are laughably silly.

809190,5,6304111231,"CLASH OF THE TITANS is an epic adventure that lives up to its title, and is a marvelous feat in Fantasy and Greek mythology. The Greeks incur the wrath of the gods when Perceus, son of Zeus, is cast to a watery grave. Zeus spares his life so that he may prove himself by completing a series of death-defying tasks in order to fulfill his destiny! TITANS is best known as being the last film to feature Ray Harryhausen's incredible art design, but it is also remembered for displaying many of his most iconic creations. The special FX are purely imaginative, combining breathtaking models and miniatures with elaborate set designs and immaculate stop-motion animation imposed over convincing green-screened environments. Many of the effects may seem dated by today's standards, but for the time, they reached the height of claymation's capabilities in creating believable characters and monsters. CLASH OF THE TITANS couldn't have been a more appropriate title considering the all-star cast, with Laurence Olivier starring as the great Zeus himself, along with film greats Maggie Smith, Claire Bloom, Burgess Meredith, and others. Harry Hamlin captures Perceus' brave but impetuous nature perfectly, in turn creating one of the most memorable Fantasy heroes of all time. Each of the moments of action and suspense are heightened by Rosenthal's triumphant score that imbues the picture with a lasting sense of excitement and danger. Even with its lengthy exposition, CLASH OF THE TITANS maintains a high level of interest thanks to the many fast-paced action sequences that are spread evenly throughout the script. It represents some of the finest filmmaking from a bygone era of film that has since been replaced by computerized imaging.

809267,5,6304111231,"I decided to write a review on this Blu-ray because some others think the DVD is better looking than the Blu-ray. I disagree. I also have the DVD and bought the Blu-ray. In every scene I have compared the Blu-ray is much sharper than the DVD. Any film grain in the original source material will become more apparent if you scan it at a higher resolution such as Blu-ray. I personally abhor film grain but I would rather the studios scan the original source material for the most detail possible instead of softening the image by digital noise reduction and other techniques. Hopefully some of the newer televisions will incorporate better image processing algorithms to eliminate film grain without softening the image. I would prefer to modify the image on screen myself instead of the studio doing it for me. So I say get the Blu-ray.

I have compared the DVD and the Blu-ray again and noticed that if I reduce the sharpness on my HDTV LCD or my Blu-ray player the film grain is greatly reduced or eliminated. Under these conditions the Blu-ray is definitely superior to the DVD. The Blu-ray is much sharper and has much more of a 3D effect than the DVD.",1272153600,4,1156,4.611650485436893

This huge romantic adventure still offers big fun with its mix of questing heroes, beautiful heroines, scary monsters and duels to the death.  Harry Hamlin is a handsome and serious Perseus and Sir Lawrence Olivier is Zeus.  Some critics derided Olivier as ""slumming"" when he did this film, but clearly he had bills to pay and he seems to be enjoying himself enormously playing a god.

But the real reason to see this film in its new Blu-ray incarnation, is to again enjoy, but in greater clarity, the extraordinary art of Ray Harryhausen as he brings to life the mythic creatures like the snake-headed Medusa and the fearsome Kracken with a singular and precise grace.

809276,5,6304111231,"Before you see the newly updated version with fancy CGI, I highly recommend taking a look back to 1981's ""Clash of the Titans"" directed by Desmond Davis. Looking at it today for the first time, the special effects do seem pretty silly in places, but if you think about it from the perspective of its first audiences, this was probably OFF THE CHAIN! (though no one used that expression either) In an ancient world of petty jealous feuding gods, Perseus (Harry Hamlin) is the son of Zeus (Laurence Olivier) and is put through many trials and tests to ultimately win his bride, the beautiful Andromeda (Judi Bowker).

The gods are so deliciously childish and vengeful, it's like watching a soap opera. Laurence Olivier uses all stiffness of his stature to go monarch on everyone else. Hera is played by Claire Bloom and Aphrodite is played by Ursula Andress whom you might remember as the first Bond girl.

Poseidon is played by Jack Gwillim whose special effect of being able to breathe underwater for long periods of time is pretty funny. My favorite god (or goddess rather) would be Thetis played by none other than Maggie Smith. I was so excited to see her younger looking face onscreen! She is usually known these days for playing older women roles like Mother Superior in ""Sister Act"" and Professor McGonagall in the ""Harry Potter"" franchise due to the unique tone of her voice and sweet older appearance.

Her giant watery eyes lend so much emotion to everything she does, even when being an immature vengeful god! I think my favorite special effect in this movie is when her tribute statue falls apart after the queen makes an offhand remark about her beauty and her statue head's eyes open and she issues threats to the people. It doesn't match up perfectly, but wow, I could see how cool that must have been to see in '81!

Perseus is a mop-top of a strong youth with a killer island boy tan and serves as the brunt force of the film. He fights, slices, dices, and manages to also occasionally outwit his foes and move quietly and gracefully around Medusa until ready to strike. Most of the time, the other characters have to tell him what to do and the gods cheat by sending him weapons and a golden owl that would annoy Harry Potter's Hedwig.

Andromeda is beautiful in that Princess Buttercup/Robin Wright sort of way that just defies today's standards and brings us back to a simpler time of ringlet curls and sparkle and innocence. What I enjoyed about her character is that she attempts to fight her own battles as well by trying to accompany Perseus on his missions. The others look a little annoyed at her tagging along but I thought it showed guts to take that stubbornness and want to try and be useful in thwarting her demise. She is graceful, dutiful, and looks great in a very sparkly sacrificial dress.

This is a great 80s adventure movie for sure. There are lots of giant creatures like scorpions and crows, a flying horse we all know as Pegasus, a gadgety owl, the giant seamonster Kraken, and the favorite, the slithery glowing eyed Medusa in all her stop-motion glory. It's a lot of fun, the pace moves well for the time. I expect the new updated version to be edited so tightly in the action sequences that we'll all get practically dizzy, especially if in a 3D showing.",1270944000,3,3298,4.6194539249146755

Similar to a lot of people, I remember seeing this (if not bits and pieces of it) on TV growing up as a kid. If not this, then probably some form of Jason and The Argonauts or The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad. Ray Harryhausen and his people did a great job trying to captivate audiences with their work, with Clash of the Titans likely being their most memorable effort. Almost 30 years later with this Blu-ray release, nostalgia must be rampant for those old enough to recall this wondrous interpretation of Greek mythology and fantastic tale of adventure, drama, and romance. I can honestly say until a few months ago when I heard of the upcoming remake, I really didn't remember much about this film. So in preparation for its arrival I decided to give this a rent to refresh my memory. Needless to say, it had been so long, I only now realized how good of a movie this is. Granted, the special effects weren't too great for its time, but I especially like the screenplay and script. Many of the actors/actresses are also British, resulting in a very thespian quality, which I think coincidentally ties in very well to ""things of the past"" as Mr. Harryhausen would say. Much like how you didn't see too many Greek-themed movies back then, you really don't see much thespian-type works outside of theater houses anymore either. And even after all these years, Titans '81 still manages to carry itself despite its age. The plot is revealed right from the get-go and progresses fairly well throughout, while providing just enough excitement and intrigue to keep the audience entertained. Although, I regret to say the special effects did end up hindering it a bit. Obviously, it was not big-budget like a Star Wars or Blade Runner back then, but I think it makes up for that in innocence.

Video - 3.5

Presented by Warner Bros. in 1080p at an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, Clash '81 ranges from decent to good at best. Grain is all over the place, even in the cleanest of scenes, and accompanied by an equal amount of noise in the darker ones. Colors are a little more vibrant than the DVD, but just barely. However, detail and texture look much sharper, though can appear somewhat hazy in conjunction with the constant presence of that grain. Black levels and contrast receive a slight boost in depth as well, and shadow delineation seems a little more pronounced compared to what I saw in SD. All in all, considering this wasn't even that high of a budget, this is probably as good as the video will get without massive image manipulation having to be applied.

Audio - 4.0

This is probably the most notable of improvements over the DVD. While the original sound master was only limited to 2 channels, this DTS-HD 2.0 track is surprisingly buoyant. Separation of dialogue, sound effects, and music are good, even immersing at some points like there was actual surround speaker usage from the sides. Although, high and low ends aren't too different from one another, leaving a little more to be desired, but it's good for what was available. Again, this is probably as good as it'll get. Just goes to make you wonder how a sound design like Clash '81 can get lossless audio when bigger name movies and TV series still aren't getting stuck with lossy.

Extras - 2.0

Clocking in at just a little over 20 minutes, we get a very brief interview with Ray Harryhausen about his overall thoughts and experiences with the making of Titan's '81. The main segment is about 12 minutes and delves a little here and there about production, writing, and his own personal opinions on the project. The rest of the extras are about 1-minute-long vignettes of Harryhausen explaining the creatures and how they were constructed/animated. Suffice it to say, the real highlight is the 5 minute preview of the 2010 remake that talks a little about the CG designs for Medusa and The Kraken. Given how outdated Titans '81's effects are, I'm actually pretty stoked for when I get to see the remake at some point.

Overall - 3.5

Clash of the Titans (1981) certainly has its roots set with a unique charm and level of nostalgia for its Greek mythology and competent storytelling. While the special effects obviously didn't stand the test of time as well as its story, the overall movie itself really isn't so bad. However, with only a decent video transfer, limited audio encode, and small amount of extras, the current SRP of $34.99 for this digibook seems a bit steep for a film that didn't even have the highest quality production of its year. If anything, watch this just for the preview of the remake. Otherwise, die-hard fans should wait for the SRP to go a lot lower for this mediocre A/V presentation.",1269043200,12,4699,4.672309552599758

But the important stuff, the film itself it's a little (so little) improvement over the grainy, blurry and fuzzy dvd edition. Better color and contrast and that's all.

This film deserves a full restoration, frame by frame. I've just seen the much older Hitchcock's masterpiece North by Northwest (also by Warner) and the matte paintings, picture composites and image tricks looked absolutely crisp and pristine. The Harryhausen fans also want this treatment.

The sneak peak of the remake looks quite good in general. I'm looking forward to watch it on the big screen. But I must say that not a million digital effects would improve the masterful craftmenship of the great Ray Harryhausen. And I also think that Sam Worthington doesn't have the charisma, stature, muscle and skin tone to play a Perseus like Harry Hamlin was. A perfect specimen of a men and a very good actor.

809442,4,6304111231,"I loved this movie when it came out.  Probably saw it 5 times in the theater (I think I was 12).  Great fun if you don't try to over analyze it.  I won't necessarily talk about the movie here, but my rating reflects my love of the film.

Just got the blu-ray yesterday and watched it last night on a 1080p 65"" panasonic plasma.  Over all, I think the transfer isn't bad. There are some grainy transfers (the opening scene starts this way, and I was thinking---oh this isn't going to be good). But some of the scenes are crystal clear with great definition. Be ready to see all the flaws that you wouldn't see in the DVD, given the mix of stop motion animation, mattes, etc. With the HD transfer, you'll see blue lines around mattes and background film.  The most obvious thing to me was the burning ""body"" in the Joppa square is very clearly made of wood; it's almost painful to see how bad the prop is when shown in high def. You'll also notice how obvious the witches' prosthetic chins and eye covers are; again the price of having a more defined product.  I actually enjoyed seeing how all the different techniques blended together to make the film, but it could be distracting to others.

I'd say my biggest distraction with it all (and this showed in the theater and DVD) is how many ""night"" scenes were actually done during the day with a filter.  I think it's a bit more obvious with the high def, but if you've seen this movie in any format you've seen it.

The sound is decent; I thought it was a bit low on the volume; I had to turn it up a little louder than I normally do for movies.

There are just a few extras included on the Blu-Ray:  an interview with Harryhausen, and a Myth and Monsters Gallery.  Also included is a promo for the 2010 Clash of the Titans.  Not a lot of set up functions, but there are the most subtitle options I've ever seen on a movie (about 20).  The book has some pictures in it, and a ticket for $7.50 to see the 2010 movie.

809443,5,6304111231,"I first saw ""Clash of the Titans"" on television years ago when I was a little kid in the 80s. It became one of my favorite movies at that age along with other films such as ""Empire Strikes Back"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", and ""Neverending Story.""

The movie is about Perseus who is sent on a quest with some other guys for some reason I can't remember. He is in love with the princess Andromeda played by the beautiful Judi Bowker. Andromeda's previous lover is Calibos, who was turned into a beast for hunting Zeus's deer. He lives in the wilderness with a group of thugs. In his quest Perseus encounters giant scorpions, blind witches, and Medusa. He is aided by Athena's mechanical owl Bubo.

This movie was a great movie to see when I was a kid. The movie was very suspenseful and had me on the edge of my seat. The scene that was particularly suspenseful was the scene where Perseus and his men encounter Medusa, who can turn people into stone who look at her. The idea of being turned into stone frightened me when I was a kid and I remember being horrified when one of Perseus's men is turned into stone.

Why might that be-well,it appears in 2010 parents are more likely be comfortable with taking their kids to a 300 type violent blood and gore feast but like to freak out if their kids see a naked little boy on the screen..Hmmm...So the 2010 remake is rather gory and more violent which suggest that since 1981 American tolerences for violence on the screen has gone up while tolerence for something as innocent as a bit of naturism or a mother feeding her child or a kid going skinny-dipping on the screen has gone down..Anyway,If you've seen ""Jason and The Argonauts"" you'll love ""Clash of the Titans"".If you loved the old World Book Encylopedia Childcraft books with the small models of ""wonders of the ancient world"" you will love this film. You may even love this film if the orginal Star Wars film looked great for you before Lucas decided to CGI it up as well... Here you have Zeus(Sir Laurence Olivier) keeping a watchful eye on his son Perseus(Harry Hamlin). And I thought that Zeus would do nothing to protect his son. I didn't blame him when he asphyxiated the king who condemned him and his mother out to sea. Yes, he worshiped Zeus, but his own pride and tyranny caused his downfall. And he cursed the son of Thetis(Maggie Smith) for causing endangered species in the land.  I liked the epic battles: Perseus slaying the gorgon Medusa, battling the giant scorpions, and riding Pegases; the winged horse. And that owl that was made into a robot, that was indeed the first to see updated technology for the gods. And the Krakken was the most awesome creature in the film that was taken down by the head of Madusa. Although there were slight changes from the books, the impact form the movie is just as exciting and I liked it. Very good fantasy movie, always a keeper to me. Why not 5 stars here-the transfer is not perfect and the film does sometimes lack something but I am not quiet sure-still,it is well worth buying at 10.00 and under. If you are a parent more likely to get upset out having your child see a few bare bottoms or a bare breast send your kid to watch the 2010 violent blood feast coming to a theatre near you as thankfully,there is no scenes of naked little boys to offend.-yes,I am being sarcastic but what more can one really say?...All I can say is,if nuns were not offenened why should some parents?...Anyway,what I most want the viewers to know this original Clash of the Titans though lacking the special effects of the 2010 remake has all the heart and soul of a great story and it is the STORY an not the effects that pull you in. In the 2010 remake all you have are generous special effects and a story that is flat and characters that you really don't care anything about.",1264809600,7,3792,4.392603129445234
809516,5,6304111231,I had (lost it) the original dvd release and intend to purchase this great movie again.  Wondering about the movie length though.  The original lists it at 118 minutes and this re-release lists it at 158 minutes...thats 40 more minutes!  Is this a typo or does the 158 minutes include dvd extras?  I thought the runtimes listed for dvds were for the actual movie length.,1263254400,,370,4.6461538461538465
809517,5,6304111231,"If you're fascinated with Greek mythology, then definitely see Clash Of The Titans (1981).  This movie features stop-motion animation and special effects that, I must say, look incredibly fake by today's standards.  But I'm not one to complain about the technology of decades ago because I realize that technology improves over time.  If anything, I find that the stop-motion animation enhances my viewing experience of this movie.  I can appreciate the effort that went into making this film.

This movie can basically be summed up this way:  Perseus, the son of the Greek god Zeus, is seeking a way to defeat an ancient monster known as the Kraken and win Princess Andromeda's hand in marriage.  Andromeda is the daughter of Queen Cassiopeia and can't marry unless her suitor solves a riddle.  If the answer given to the riddle is wrong, the suitor will be burned at the stake.  Perseus captures the flying horse Pegasus and answers the riddle and wins Andromeda's hand in marriage.  A mechanical replica of Athena's owl Bubo is given to Perseus as an aid.  Bubo proves to be quite helpful to Perseus, even leading him to the Stygian Witches, who tell Perseus that Medusa's head can defeat the Kraken by turning it to stone.  Perseus travels to the Isle of the Dead and severs Medusa's head.  He travels back astride Pegasus to find that Andromeda was tied up and being sacrificed to the Kraken, which rose from the sea.  In the nick of time, Perseus uses Medusa's head to turn the Kraken to stone.  Andromeda is freed by Perseus and the movie ends with Perseus a hero.

This is a classic movie with many stars in the cast with Harry Hamlin as Perseus and Judi Bowker as Andromeda.  This movie also stars Laurence Olivier, Burgess Meredith, Claire Bloom, Maggie Smith, Ursula Andress, Sian Phillips, and Flora Robson.

This DVD's special features include a conversation with visual effects creator Ray Harryhausen, Map Of Myths And Monsters Gallery, the theatrical trailer, scene access and more.

If you like fantasy movies about mythology and can appreciate stop-motion animation, then definitely see the classic Clash Of The Titans.  Very highly recommended.",1262995200,2,2163,4.9390581717451525

There are monsters a plenty: the evil Calibos, Medusa, the two headed hound, giant scorpions and the Kraken!  While not as good as his earlier foray into the world of Greek Myths, JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, still an entertaining film and fitting finale to a career on the big screen that began in 1948 with MIGHTY JOE YOUNG.

809520,4,6304111231,"It was the Warner Brothers DVD of this movie that brought me to really liking this film. I am surprised that some people criticize the Warner Brothers DVD of the original ""Clash of the Titans"" Harryhausen movie (as I am the first to criticize some of Warner's work, especially the unfortunate -- loss of black detail -- job done on the recent high definition Blu-ray of ""North By Northwest""). I saw ""Clash of the Titans"" on its original theatrical release (and I was really critical of the soft/diffuse look) as well as on television (really soft look) and VHS (where it just looked like mush). The Warner DVD really is the best presentation that I have ever seen of the film and it gave me a renewed appreciation of the movie. Usually, when I hear some younger person say that a DVD transfer or a new HD Blu-ray transfer of a movie is ""the best it ever looked"" then I wince and say ""Kid, you really don't know!"". But, this is one case where it is true -- Whoever was responsible for the Warner Brothers DVD of this film did an excellent job. I am now excited to see what the March 2010 high definition Blu-ray will look like. Sony/Columbia Pictures disappointed me with the high-def Blu-ray of Harryhausen's classic  ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"" with it's ""red shift"" in the colors that degraded the overall look (I add that many shots look better in the older standard def DVD of the Sinbad movie). So, I await with great anticipation to see if we get a leap in quality when the high def of ""Clash of the Titans"" is released -- I really want it to look great!",1260835200,7,1563,4.427083333333333

809548,5,6304111231,"People have loved stories like this for thousands and thousands of years, so I feel it's cool to dig the movie a couple decades after my childhood. ""Clash of the Titans"" has it all and you know it. A classic mythological tale filled with heart-wrenching drama, more passion you can shake a stick at, and loads of adventure and so on. This Hollywood/Greek tale employs enough universal archetypes to leave famed mythologist Joseph Campbell smiling ear to ear and nodding his head with approval -but also hoping the kids don't skip their reading assignments (because this is a Hollywood re-imagining of the Greek myths, but we know that it's for fun!).

The fantastic casts includes Maggie Smith (Thetis, goddess mother of the cursed Calibos) who audiences will also know from the Harry Potter films, famed Shakespearean actor Laurence Olivier (as Zeus), and Harry Hamlin as our brave hero, Perseus. The plot is a hero's journey sorta deal. Hero gets into trouble and then gets out of trouble and through it all is aided and challenged by super-natural forces. If you haven't seen this particular movie when you see it you'll in a way feel like you have, but that is a good thing. There is an amazingly gorgeous girl to be saved, lots of monsters and warriors and a mechanical owl. The owl was my favorite as a child (still is). I loved the owl. It was forged by the gods to aid our hero along with some other cool weapons. As well as being a showcase of Greek mythological beasts, gods, and heroes, it is also the ultimate display of all time master of stop-motion, Ray Harryhausen. Stop-motion is still great.

However, that still kinda adds to this films charm.  It looks more like claymation, which is not as cartoonish as today's CGI special effects.  The babe of this film is Judi Bowker, who plays Andromeda.  She's easily forgettable (to me anyway, I'm more partial to brunettes and black haired girls), however she's still a pretty blonde.  She shows a nice hind side visual of a nice breast shot while her servants are bathing her.

Again, anyway, it is true that this transfer to Blu-Ray is no better than the DVD.  The opening scene where baby Persius and his mother is put out to sea, and just about any large pull back scenes of the city, and every scene with Zeus and the ladies were all extremely grainy.  It's hard to believe that this is a Blu-Ray disc, and also costs more than $20.

I have always been intrigued by mythology and everything that deals with it. Its fascninating. I am actually surprised that this is one of the only movies dealing with it in depth. Though nowadays, the movie looks dated and the effects are pretty awful(and I mean that in a good way), it still remains one of the most fun fantasies.

Perseus is the main character and we follow him throughout his journey to save the princess Andromeda from an evil doom. So much happens in between that I can't even name it all.
I know that they are actually going to remake this film. As much as I love this film, I have always said that if there were one film that deserved it, Clash of the Titans would be it. I think it would benefit, but only if whoever directs it doesn't get rid of the Gods' aspect. I have read rumours about that. The Gods were important and essential to the original.

809655,5,6304111231,"This movie represents the peak of what can be done with stop motion animation. There are other movies that might be said to be just as good, such as Jason and the Argonauts or the Sinbad movies, but none have been better. In addition, the story  line is particularly well developed, being a retelling of one of the less known  greek myths, formerly known best by a few classical scholars and not particularly known to the general public.
  Watching this movie in the era of computer graphics, I find that it still stands up well. Remember that the purpose of any animation effect is not to make the viewer believe that the creature exists but to show the viewer what it would look like if it did exist. Certainly no sane viewer believes the tyranosaur skeleton in Night in the Museum is real, any more than they believe that the skeletons in Jason and the
argonauts are real.  They are simply there to stimulate our imaginations, and the success of the effect is how well they do that and how smoothly they advance the story line.  In that regard, stop motion effects may actually be more effective, since they require much more time and labor to produce and thus the director is not going to introduce them unless they are absolutely necessary. CG creatures, on the other hand, are much faster and require less labor to produce (Although they are still not cheap).

It's not the special effects of Harryhausen which are pretty variable in quality (my favorite is Medusa, my least favorite is that damn owl).

It's not the story which flows well enuf except for the tendency to draw out the special effects scenes (as with all Harryhausen films).

It's not the major British stars (eg, Olivier typecast as Zeus) languishing on Mt Olympus, drawing paychecks.

It's not the Americans Harry Hamlin or Burgess Meredith, altho they do very well.

It's the heartbreakingly beautiful and talented Judi Bowker (as Andromeda) in one of her few film roles. She has a reasonable amount of screen time. And she was gorgeous in that ancient Greek costuming.

I definately recommend this one to anybody interested in Greek mythology. I actually was interested in it because of God of War II, in which there is a battle against the main character of this movie. The only real complaint i have is, i guess with the title. Clash of the Titans. It is referring to Medusa and the Kraken. Both of which are in fact NOT TITANS. So the title makes no sense at all. They refer to the two of them as titans, when they are not.

THE CLASH OF THE TITANS is taken from several Greek myths involving Perseus the son of the great god Zeus and  the mortal Danae. In CLASH OF THE TITANS Perseus  battles some real monsters of Greek mythology like the Medusa as well as monsters borrowed from other cultures such as the Scandinavian Kraken and some invented for the movie like Calibos.  The movie is well made and entertaining though of course the special effects are dated in the eyes of many modern viewers.  The oversized vulture and Pegasus the flying horse appear clunky in flight and the two headed dog is not very convincing.  Perseus's magical owl sidekick is apparently there partly for comic relief and that creature looks like a cross between a Furby and Gizmo from GREMLINS with a clicking speech reminiscent of Star Wars' R2D2.  The movie is rated PG though there is a bit of nudity and gore and would undoubtedly have been rated PG-13 if that rating had existed in 1981.,1181174400,3,1120,4.626262626262626

809728,5,6304111231,"I must begin with this: there is nothing more fantastic than watching classic Greek mythology films with a bag of popcorn by your side. Greek mythology will never do you wrong. Of course, there are a few Greek mythology films that aren't exactly fantastic, but Clash of the Titans is definitely not one of those. Clash of the Titans serves to quench that thirst for adventure every time.

Clash of the Titans is a fantasy/adventure that follows the mythical journey of Perseus to battle the titan Medusa in order to save a princess from very certain death by that of the Kraken. If you're unfamiliar with Medusa or the Kraken, I'll sum them up for you in two words: very scary.

Although Clash of the Titans has a few silly moments, it is overall a very serious and exciting adventure. Watching Perseus overcome the greatest of obstacles is what good Greek mythology is all about. Throw in some help from the Greek Gods and you've got yourself a classic to remember.

What needs to be noted here, as with all of the Greek mythology and Arabian Nights movies of the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s, is the incredible art done by Ray Harryhausen, the most brilliant stop-motion special effects artist to step into motion pictures. If not for him, we would not have any clashing between any titans. Harryhausen really brings these creatures to life with such beauty they seem almost as real and scary as one would only imagine in dreams.

If you enjoy a great adventure story and haven't really had the chance to see one lately, I recommend you pick this one up quickly! It stands tall among the likes of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.""",1176249600,2,1649,4.598639455782313

The print is very watchable and at a bargain price of $5.00 it should not be passed up, but the film and Harryhausen deserve much better!

809747,5,6304111231,"In 1986 just 5 years after the 1981 release of Clash of the Titans came a movie that set the new standard for ""creature"" special effects. That movie was Aliens, and comparing the creature special effects of Aliens to that of Clash of the Titans is like comparing Aliens to The Muppets.

But stop motion was a special effect that worked well for decades before green-screen technology. Indeed it worked well in Clash of the Titans. But it was the end of an era.

Ray Harryhausen was the absolute King of Stop Motion with such classics under his reign as Jason and the Argonauts, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, The Valley of the Gwangi and 20 Million Miles to Earth. However the aforementioned films enjoyed great longevity as FX classics because they were all made in the 50s and 60s. Clash of the Titans FX looked ""very fake"" in a relatively short period of time. And unfortunately, the enhanced, cleaned up picture on this DVD only highlights as campy what was once breakthrough.

But the effects aside, Clash of the Titans is a classic tale of Mythology to enjoy with the kids that you wondered if you'd even have as you sat watching this late at night during its run on cable TV in the early 80s. It's got a PG rating, but there is a bit that might have gotten it a PG-13 today (brief nudity, a scary/violent confrontation with Medusa).

So if you think your child is on the borderline of maturity to view 1981's Clash of the Titans, perhaps wait for the 2008 Warner Brothers remake (in pre-production according to IMDB and TheMovieInsider).",1160352000,4,1539,4.565217391304348

There's even a little booklet on the 2010 remake, plus a coupon good for up to $7.50 off admission to the new film.  So far, so good, right?

But then I popped in the disc.  Now, I appreciate that this is a 30-year old film and maybe high definition isn't going to do it any favors.  Some of the effects scenes, especially those involving mattes, no longer look good.  Let me pause right here and I say I'm a fan of the old-school stop-motion animation, matte paintings, all that stuff.  But the increased resolution does show off the deficiences of the some of the those old photographic tricks.  I'm also not one of those jaded folks who insist my films--especially my fantasy films--be ultra-realistic.  But if you're one of those who can't suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours, you will be disappointed.

But the larger problem is that no attempt seems to have been made to really restore film elements that haven't aged well.  The scenes inside Medusa's cave--agrguably among the film's most memorable moments--are horribly grainy.  I mean, I had this movie once upon a time on VHS and I'm quite certain it looked better than this.  Likewise, the outdoor nighttime battle with giant scorpions is quite murky.  It just seems to me someone was being lazy about throwing this thing together, probably in time to capitalize on the 2010 version (a brief featurette about which autoplays when you put in the disc).

And I guess we might not even have Clash of the Titans on Blu-ray if not for the new film.  I haven't seen it as of this writing, but I'm already concerned that the whole 5 minutes of the featurette focus on the CGI effects being utilized.

My one real complaint (and the reason I'm giving it 3 stars) concerns the gratuitous nudity. The version I seen showed  Perseus' mother nursing him and a full-frontal shot of her strutting along the beach. There were also completely unnecessary shots of Andromeda in the bath. Both of the above scenes added nothing to the story, the sole purpose was titillation. Unsurprisingly, there was no such male nudity.

809753,5,6304111231,"Here is marked the metaphorical 'hero's journey', as Joseph Campbell would put it, depicting all the elements of the epic voyages of olde, which has its equivalent in every culture. This film has even been used in classrooms to demonstrate the fable for both an entertaining and educational account.

  Based upon traditional Greek mythology, this film illustrates this legend to a tee. The tale of Perseus in search of the one thing which can overcome The Kraken {a most impressive Leviathan / Cthulhu - like creature unleashed by Poseidon}, which just so happens to be Medusa's head, containing the power to transform humans into stone {Medusa was unfairly cursed by Hera after being seduced by Zeus}. But first, with the sage help of 'Ammon' {Burgess Meredeth}, demigod Perseus must realize who he is, the son of Zeus, and gather the implements to fulfill his 'destiny', including an invisibility cloak. and an impregnable sword and shield.

  After passing a riddle test initiated by Hera, he follows a huge vulture upon the winged steed Pegusus to battle Calibos {a demonic archetype and son of Hera cursed by Zeus to malformation}, and is prompted upon his quest to save Princess Andromeda from being sacrificed to The Kraken. Along the way, he meets The Stygian Witches, three cannibalistic hags who share an oracle named 'The Eye'; Charon, or ""The Devil's Boatman"" {a Grim Reaper archetype} at the River Styx which carries he and his men to The Underworld; Cerberus, {here depicted with two heads instead of the usual three}; and finally Medusa, in a memorably striking humanoid / serpentine representation.

  The characters are dynamically brought to life and very well animated with pre-CGI stop-motion photography, and the costumes and sets are rendered to splendid authenticity. The Gods are appropriately displayed with very human traits, considering that man has created his gods in his own image. I especially enjoyed Zeus' coliseum in which he preserves figurines of various mortals which he manipulates at will - would be quite useful as effigies...",1148774400,,2067,5.127976190476191
809754,2,6304111231,"I guess that all you old timers look at these kinds of movies and think ""ah, the good old days"".  The younger generation (me) looks at these movies and thinks ""wow, those old movie-makers were losers x-treme"".  I am used to GOOD special effects and lots of planning and detail going into the speaking and plot and storyline to make a good movie.  For me, this movie had none of them.

The story was really hard to follow.  It kept switching quests and changing direction.  Also, the way that it kept switching between Mt. Olympus and the real world was distracting.  I can't tell the Godeses apart!  The acting wasn't TOO bad, but some of the lines were just ridiculous.  I can't remember any at the moment (I saw it a year ago) but I distinctly remember my cousins and I rolling on the floor with some of the lines.

The thing that definitely irritated me the most were the way the writer used the same scene twice.  I mean, he cut out a small portion of the flim and pasted it in two different parts of the movie.  He did this on at least three ocasions.  It was annoying and I felt insulted.  I guess the director didn't think the audience was smart enough to tell them apart.  Either that or things were done differently fifty years ago.

Let's not mention the special effects.  It looks like a kid drew a flying horse, glued it to a popsical stick, and wiggled it across the camera.  In the scene where Perseus is capturing Pegasus, the sky is pink when there's a real horse and dark blue when it's an animation.  If the director took a little more care with his fliming, maybe I could enjoy it and respect it more.

Also, what's with the naked ladies?  The director throws in a couple of random scenes with nudity for no reason.  He doesn't explain it or revisit it; there's just this random scene with Pereus (?) and his mother strolling down theh beach, nude, and then the story zooms ahead twenty years.  WHY?!

As a modern American growing up in the era of digital animation and LOTR, I found this movie laughable.  People who have fond memories wil disagree with all of my above points, but this is my perspective on ""Clash of the Titans"".

P.S.  I hated the tutor.  He was a snob!",1146960000,7,2192,4.3722084367245655
809755,5,6304111231,"The movie Ray Harryhausen is perhaps best known for is JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, so it should not be surprising that after a decade of working on Sinbad pictures, the master of stop-motion animation returned to the Greek mythology universe. Here, in what proved to be his final movie is the story of Perseus and Andromeda in an all-star cast extravaganza.
Of course, even though this movie has perhaps one of the most impressive cast list of any Harryhausen movie, the true star here is the special effects. And in a world that is now dominated with computer-generated effects, the stop-motion Kraken or Pegasus look a little dated now, but I think that that is part of their charm.
There's something almost TOO perfect about CGI effects (though there are exceptions like the truly terrible parasurfing scene in 2002's DIE ANOTHER DAY), and the rather obvious two-headed dog  and the snake-haired Medusa in this picture have a certain charm to them that is lost in today's cinema.
Yet, it would be remiss not to mention the cast of this movie. A relative unknown at the time the movie was made who went on to fame in TV's L.A. LAW and is possibly best known to audiences today as the villainous Aaron Echolls on VERONICA MARS is Harry Hamlin.
Joining Hamlin is some inspired casting in the parts of the Greek Gods. Who better to play Zeus than theater and film great Laurence Olivier and is there anyone more suited to play the Goddess of Love Aphrodite than former Bond girl (and Hamlin's real-life partner at the time) Ursula Andress. Rounding out the Gods is the famed British actress Maggie Smith who plays the sea goddess Thetis.
The movie starts with the only daughter of Acrisius (Danae) and her son Perseus being set adrift to die for her having a baby out of wedlock. Of course the father is Zeus and so he has the coffin in which Danae and Perseus were placed guided safely to a far away shore.
Years later a grown-up Perseus goes to sleep on the shore and wakes to find himself far away in the center of an amphitheater. There he meets the friendly playwright Ammon (played by screen great Burgess Meredith) and  (understandably) falls in love with the princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker).
Unfortunately for Perseus, the princess had been engaged to Thetis' son, before he was punished for his cruelty by Zeus by being disfigured and banished to the swamps. Soon Perseus Is on a series of quests to tame the flying horse Pegasus, defeat and capture the head of Medusa and  solving a series of riddles, all with the help of Zeus and the opposition of Thetis.
Of course the plot, which is actually comprised of several myths woven together, is simply a backdrop on which to feature all the incredible effects of Harryhausen and his team. All are very impressive, even the rather obtrusive and silly mechanical owl (which I found annoying as a child, and still find annoying today).
At the time of the release Harryhausen granted an interview with the British magazine Starburst in which he addressed  his interest in mythology at the expense of science fiction (which was all the rage at that time in the wake of 1977's STAR WARS). Simply put, Harryhausen posited that science fiction would only be impressive for a set amount of time, whereas fantasy is timeless. I subscribe to this view. Harryhausen also talked about the sometimes very tedious nature of stop-motion saying that there were some days when he just couldn't face working on a couple of seconds of Kraken footage.
This DVD does include a number of special features including a conversation with Harryhausen, a ""Map of myths and monsters"" gallery and cast film highlights, but the most troubling aspect is the poor quality of the actual transfer. Hopefully a better print of this movie will be released on DVD in the future.
Entertaining, fast-paced and a great companion piece to the aforementioned JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, this was Harryhausen's last movie (no doubt in part to the explosion in CGI) and it's a triumphant swan song.

809756,5,6304111231,"I originally watched Clash of the Titans as a little boy and I watched the film again yesterday for the first time in over 20 years. I loved the film as a little boy, and I find that my love has not changed over time. The only difference now is that I merely experienced the film as a boy, but as a grown up I can reflect upon it. I view that philosophically. The images of the different scenes came back to mind as I watched. These memories must have been lost in my sub-conscience for a long time. I was still on one hand seeing through a kids eyes, but at the same time I was understanding everything as an adulty--Fascinating! As to the special effects, I like them. Yes, there are people who critique them in a nagative way, but I do not really care for the special effects greatly in Star Wars[I do like that film though]. I find the stop-motion techniques of Ray Harryhausen to be delightful. Well when it regards the lack of complete realism, I find that it does not matter because we are dealing with fantasy. Furthermore, I am not interested in having fantasy made in a boring realistic way. I found the scenery and the directing to be wonderful. I must say that there were shots in that film that are breath taking such as the ocean and beach scenes. As regards the minor nudity, it is just that--Minor. I find that it celebrates the human body in a tasteful way much in the same way as the Greeks did in the world of Classical art that they created. Yes, the screen play does not follow the original myth, but that does not matter as myths change over time. I think that the Perseus of our time is better than that of the ancients. I found the acting to be good, as well as the costumes. The philosophy in the Clash of the Titans is acceptable. The conclusion of Zeus regarding humanity and the gods is true when it regards being a reasonable person concerning the subject. There is no Psuedo-philosophy to be found in this film except if you study at some point in the film you will find a Philosophical contradiction. My final thought is that the Clash was never bettween Perseus and the Kraken, but bettween Medusa and the Kraken as they were Titans. Well if we treat the myth strictly then the Kraken was never a part of Classical Greek Mythology, but he too was a product of the changing human mind. Well the film is excellent in my opinion and I recommend that all people should see it at least once. When it concerns myself, I am not going to wait 20 more years to watch this film again.",1145923200,,2506,4.311440677966102

 I couldn't wait to expose my young daughter to his genius and this movie was the cherry on top of what has been a great special effects career.

 A lot of people here have praised this film in ways I could not hope to match, but I did want to dwell a minute on the sadness felt knowing that this was the last hurrah from a man who had generations growing up and watching his movies over and over and over again. Parents who saw the originals in theatres, making sure their kids caught Harrys movie on the TV and their grandchildren lucky enough to live in an age where a couple of bucks gets you all his work to enjoy as much and as often as they wish on a couple of pieces of round plastic.  CGI no doubt closed the coffin on what had been a major part of fantasy/scifi movies special effects as Im sure even those who worked and studied under the master must have know that computers would soon do the work HH and associates did but without the carefull painstaking attention and love showered on his projects that so clearly came thru in the end product.",1145491200,,1248,4.316239316239316

And the actors were completely over the top, too...Harry Hamlin, Ursula Andress, (Dame) Maggie Smith, Burgess Meredith and the incomparable (Sir) Laurence Olivier as Zeus.

809762,4,6304111231,"This classic piece of 1980's cheese is one of my guilty pleasures.  I won't ruin it by giving any spoilers, suffice to say it is a fun tale of a hero who has to overcome several obstacales and monsters to save the kingdom and get the girl.  Overall it is a great action adventure film even if it tries a little to hard to be an epic.

The movie has an impressive cast: Harry Hamlin, who would later go to LA Law; a still hot Ursula Andress; Burgess Meredith in between Rocky films; Maggie Smith way before her days at Hogwarts; AND Sir Laurence Olivier who was slumming it I guess.  All of whom do a wonderful and convincing job in this tale of heros, gods and monsters.

Speaking of monsters, one of the things that I really enjoy about this film is the stop motion photography and animation mix that were used as the special effects in this movie.  Certainly by today's standard they look a little silly, and even back in the day when I saw this film through ten year old eyes, they looked dated compared to the other films of the day.  I didn't care then and I don't care now.  I love them! For me now it is a nostalgic look back at what special effects were in the 60's and 70's.  They especially remind me of those old Sinbad movies, which I enjoyed watching on TV as a child.

If you are looking for an action adventure flick I think you will be more than satsified with this sword and sandle fantasy.

On a note about the DVD, I have to say I am disappointed at the lack of special features.  This is definately a bare bones release.",1138233600,2,1540,4.200680272108843

We popped it in the DVD player, and they were utterly enthralled; I also could enjoy the experience as sophisticated entertainment.  Even better, my kids were full of observations and questions, which in our house we view as a successful entertainment experience.  In particular, my daughter was questioning details from what she knows of mythology from many hours of reading, seeing some discrepencies in portrayals or the addition of incidents that she didn't know.  As such, while some liberties were taken in the film, it also makes mythology a living thing - afterall, there are so many conflicting versions from classical sources that there is no definitive correct interpretation - and I got to discuss this at length with my daughter (at 10, she is falling in love with history).  While my son (6) was interested more in questioning the monsters and what they represented, that was fine too.  Finally, because we lived in Europe where nudity is simply part of life, we had no problem whatsoever that there were a few minimal glimpses of bottoms and breasts - isn't that better than the graphic violence on TV?

All in all, this is stimulating and fun, a welcome complement to the book learning that my kids are beginning to enjoy.

809764,1,6304111231,"This movie would have been welcomed by parents as an aid to their children's enjoyment of classical mythology, except that it is marred by inexplicable nudity.  Historically, the women on the ancient Greek mainland in the Heroic Age were very cloistered and dressed modestly, even in their own homes.  (The Spartan women had a little more freedom, but even they didn't waltz around in their birthday suits.) Homer's Penelope addressed her suitors in the main room of her home modestly wrapped in her stola (outer garment), even pulling one side of it over her face so that only her eyes were exposed. But this movie has Perseus' bare mother nursing him while sitting on a rock, then prancing around on the beach in the nude.  Also, we have to see Andromeda's naked body displayed (like a plucked chicken in the meat market) while she's taking a bath, which, producers in those days used to claim was ""necessary to the plot development.""  Of course, this demeaning display of female nudity was just to titillate, as the ancient myths don't even mention Andromeda's personal hygeine.

809765,5,6304111231,"Desmond Davis' 1981 film is an homage to the classic epic sword-and-sorcerer/mythologically inspired films that blossomed in the 50's and 60's; the films of actor Steve Reeves who portrayed Hercules, and other mythologically based movies such as Jason and The Argonauts. These films were often strategically televised on TV so that children could see them. As a result, such imaginative film directors as Steven Spieldberg and George Lucas grew up watching these films. The film is visually stunning and even if by today's standards the special effects and the use of clay model monsters is outdated in the face of Computer Graphics, it is still a supremely enjoyable film and remains popular, since it is still receiving cult classic fame.

The strength of the film is of course the vivid fantasy. We leave our own reality and live for a while in this ancient Greece of classical mythology. Ray Harryhausen, in one of his last films, once again pulls out all thes stops and delivers studio magic with his creations. The Kraken, Medusa, Cerebrus the dog from Hell, gold mechanical clocks and the devilish Calabos are all terrific characters. 80's hunk Harry Hamlin stars as the larger than life hero Perseus, Judi Boke as his the beautiful and cursed Princess Andromeda, the aging Laurence Olivier as Zeus king of the gods in a superb performance, Dame Maggie Smith as the frustrated and vindictive sea goddess Thetis, Sian Phillips as the vainglorious Queen Cassiopeia. Burgess Meredith, Claire Bloom and Ursual Andress round out the cast as Olympian goddesses Athena, Aphrodite and Hera. In what may have been her last or nearly last role as one of the Stygian Witches is Flora Robson, once a celebreated actress from the 40's and 50's (she was an electrifying Queene Elizabeth I of England).

809776,5,6304111231,"Stop-motion effects...Greek mythology...a snake-haired Medusa...a giant sea-monster called the Cracken...Lawrence Olvier as Zues!!!  Put it all together and you have Ray Harryhausen's master thesis for high adventure fantasy films.

  From Jules Vernes novels to Sci-Fi monster flicks, Harryhausen's creatures were the stars of some great flights of fancy.  But in an interview on this disc he tells how his heart was really drawn to this kind of adventure story from mythic tales past.  Beginning with The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Harryhausen took us to the edge of the map where it says, ""Here there be monsters.""  He also coined the phrase ""dynamation"" to describe the stop-motion effects he perfected for that movie.

  I really like Clash of the Titans best of his heroic myths.  I know Jason and the Argonauts is often cited as the ""go-to"" Harryhausen classic but this movie has much to offer also.  Based on the story of Perseus and the Gorgon, the story begins with Perseus and his mother locked in a box and tossed out to sea.  They do find their way to another kingdom and Zues intervenes to help Perseus (who like Hercules, is yet another son by a fling he had with a mortal) find his destiny.  But the goddess Thetis is not happy.  She doesn't approve of Zues playing favorites while Calibos, her loyal subject, suffers.  So Perseus is thrown into adventures that take him all over the ancient world and make him confront Calibos (the twisted man-creature who also loves Andromeda), Medusa (the hideous snake-haired woman who's glance turns men to stone), and the monstrous Cracken (who Thetis wants Andromeda sacrificed to).

  It all adds up to a really grand adventure yarn.  The story follows the original myth loosely.  I say, close enough.  All that matters is it gives us what we want in its fantastic monsters and heroics.

  I will mention a couple of short-comings, though they are not significant.  Bo-Bo the owl was an unnecessary character.  Probably thrown in as a tip-of-the-hat to George Lucas' robots in Star Wars, the character does not add to the movie's appeal, though thankfully he doesn't ruin it.  And the pace of the adventure is not the seat-of-your-pants, Indiana Jones jump from one fight to the next...which actually isn't a bad thing.

  Which begs the question:  Are modern movies that use computer animation and effects better?  I enjoyed the last Harry Potter movie, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Spider-man 2 a whole lot.  They are the heir apparents to Harryhausen.  That said, I also think we're seeing some poor movies using computer effects.  So I get nostalgic for these old fantasy adventures by Harryhausen.  When I watch them I am grateful for the time he spent animating these creatues that have personality and are still fun to watch.  Less really IS more sometimes.",1118793600,,2818,4.917021276595745
809777,3,6304111231,"Desmond Davis' 1981 film is certainly not the best collaboration with Ray Harryhausen but it is a treat nevertheless.  Even with the mediocre acting and cheap attempt at copying the Star Wars craze of that period, the film holds a special place in the history of fantasy films due to the great stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen.

The film follows the ancient Greek epic adventure of Perseus (Harry Hamlin.)  King Acrisius puts his grandson Perseus with his daughter out to sea for her fornication with Zeus (Laurence Olivier.)  Angered by his insolence, Zeus curses him and saves his son Perseus from death.  Perseus eventually finds himself in the land of Joppa ruled by Cassiopea (Sian Phillips) and her daughter Andromeda (Judi Bowker) who has been promised to Calibos (Neil McCarthy.) Calibos is punished by Zeus for desacrating his winged horses and whoever now wants to mary Andromeda must answer a riddle which Perseus solves.  But Thetis is angered at Cassiopea and demands Andromeda as a sacrifice to the Kraken.  Perseus must then go on a quest to bring back the Medusa's head: the only thing that can stop the Kraken.

Yes, the acting is pretty bad even for the theatrical actors such as Sian Phillips and Laurence Olivier but the film is fun.  Unless a better film comes along dealing with this story, this is pretty much the only movie there is.  In any case, this film still stands out for the great claymation effects of Ray Harryhausen who was a master of this art.  This is a fun film to watch every once in a while and one that appeals to children.",1117670400,,1568,4.706959706959707
809778,4,6304111231,"It was nearly twenty years after I last saw this movie repeatedly on cable premium channels that I heard Clash of the Titans being mentioned, and that was the movie Randall was trying to watch in Jay and Silent Bob but the title characters were making a fuss outside the video store.

The story is about Perseus and his battle with the Medusa, rescuing Princess Andromeda, and marrying her, but inbetween, there are a series of adventures, mostly due to the machinations of the gods and goddesses.  It begins with Acrisius, Perseus's grandfather and King of Argos, sending his daughter Danae and her infant son Perseus into the sea, locked in a large ornate box.  Perseus grows up gifted, handsome, strong, lucky, all because Zeus is his father-at least the reference to him inpregnating Danae as a shower of light is mentioned.

Part of Perseus's conflict is with Calibos, the son of Thetis (the goddess of the sea, whereas actually she was chief of the sea nymphs or Nereids).  Calibos is the opposite of Perseus, killing and despoiling everything, and all but one of Zeus's sacred winged horses, for which despite Thetis's pleas for mercy, he is metamorphosed into a hideous satanic-looking half-human monster.  Thetis in turn decides to mess with Perseus, transporting him from Seraphos to Joppa.  Perseus meets and is befriended by the playwright Ammon, as well as making allies with Thallo, one of Queen Cassiopeia's soldiers.

Joppa is under a curse by Calibos, whose thrall Princess Andromeda is under.  Suitors who fail to answer a riddle end up as barbecue.  However, Andromeda doesn't seem to have the body of a lion and this is the story of Perseus, not Oedipus.  Indeed, Thomas Bulfinch and Edith Hamilton will have major cows on seeing this mishmash of Greek mythology cranked out by Hollywood.  Charon was the ferrymen to the underworld Hades, and not to the Isle of the Dead, and Cerberus, the guardian of Hades loses a head to become the two-headed Dioskilos.  The Graea, who had a movable eye and tooth between, lose the tooth to become the Stygian Witches.  And Bubo the golden mechanical owl was clearly meant for the kids, its whistling and tooting a reference to Star Wars and R2-D2.

As for Ray Harryhausen's special effects, Bubo, the giant scorpions, and Medusa are best realized, the vulture being another disaster like the baboon in Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger.  The scene in Medusa's lair and the battle of the giant scorpions are the best.  And the gifts Perseus gets from the gods come in handy for the action sequences.  But compare Perseus's invisible helmet and golden owl to Harry Potter's invisible cloak and Hedwig-interesting parallels there.  Those growing up on Potter and the newer Star Wars films will be disappointed with the dated effects here.

The mostly British allstar cast does well, especially Laurence Olivier giving credible authority as Zeus, angry and yet fatherly.  Ursula Andress has only a few lines as Aphrodite, yet it's ironic, that as Honey Rider in Dr. No, she was a modern-day Aphrodite rising from the sea.  Maggie Smith (Thetis) is the only other goddess who figures prominently.  The mortals do just as well, Judi Bowker radiant as Andromeda, Burgess Meredith (Ammon) coaching someone other than Sylvester Stallone, Tim Pigott-Smith (Thallo).  Neil McCarthy's lantern-jawed features and large hands are recognizable behind the makeup of Calibos.

But let's examine the title.  The Titans were the primordial deities banished by Zeus and the other deities of Olympus.  On one level, the main story involves the battle between Perseus and Calibos, but behind them, it's Zeus against Thetis.  And the rows of clay figures in Mount Olympus mirrors how the gods messed with the heads of mortals, due to their whims.  The Greek deities were thus no better than the flawed mortals they were supposedly morally superior to.

After finally getting this, I enjoyed it well enough only because I saw it so many times in the 80s, but there are more gripes about it, not from the special effects but because the historian/scholarly part of me frowns when it comes to inaccuracy in Hollywood.  3.5 out of 5.",1108857600,,4162,4.919770773638969
809779,5,6304111231,"This flick is over 20 years old and was a favorite when cable TV first went into homes across America. The classic Greek Mythology comes alive with Clash of the Titans.

Perseus is played by Mr. Harry Hamlin, and even though he physically fits the part, his acting is as wooden as the sword he first receives in the theater. I mean he is trying so hard to be so articulate. Every word must be slowed down and each syllable is stressed for maximum effect. I just shudder when he looks in the distance and says ""Callibus"".

Anyway the rest of the movie is cool. Dated? Oh hell yes, but the big stop motion creatures are part of what gives this movie so much charm, just like the old Sinbad movies. Everyone loves the Medusa scene. The giant scorpions that rise from the blood of Medusa are also cool. I think another reviewer was correct in saying that this film is not entirely accurate. I think Pegasus was born from Medusa's blood and did not originate from a herd that was killed off.

Anyway the Stingeon witches, the gods (espescailly Aphrodite), and the Pesidan (sp) are all a treat to watch again and again.

Said transfer only serves to de-mystify the once-breathtaking visual effects sequences by forcing us to watch the stop-action creatures of old, delivered in frighteningly embarrassing crispness(only bringing their rubbery construction to the fore), being composited on to the live action segments that look like they are being viewed at a distance of 2 feet on a circa 1985 rear-projection television.
The performances, once treasured, now seem terribly inept even by the immortal Laurence Olivier (who I suppose has an excuse given that he was terribly ill at the time of filming) and the usually wonderful Maggie Smith.  Never being a fan of Hamlin, I will not belabour to address the shortcomings of his performance and instead relegate him to the patheon of strong-silent-type of action heroes, where he belongs.  The lovely Judi Bowker, strangely absent from cinema after 1988, plays the innocent, distressed princess as well as can be expected (in stark contrast to said innocence was the bath scene which was something of a shock for one used to seeing it on network television.)  The only truly memorable performance was given by Burgess Meredith, who it seems can deliver his ""cantankerous old man"" character in any time period.
Perhaps my greatest exception with the DVD was the lack of interesting special features.  A brief interview with Ray Harryhausen about the film most definitely does not constitute a special feature in my estimation.  I would have loved to have seen some deleted scenes (if there was enough archive footage for deleted scenes for Casablanca, I know there was for Clash of the Titans), an extensive featurette about the evolution of the film, and most especially a cast commentary.  The last would have been difficult I'm sure, but it still would have been nice.
Despite all of this, there is some redeeming value in that it is an marginally entertaining and occasionally laughable outing into Greek mythology.  If you're looking to get all of Harryhausen's work in your archive, buy the DVD.  If you're looking to re-connect visually to your original experience of the movie, you'd better pass this up.  Maybe a 25th anniversary edition with fix these problems, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

809794,4,6304111231,"Even before this movie was released in 1981, critics bashed it saying ""stop motion is out"". Stop motion is the technique by which a small model is moved a fraction of an inch, one frame at a time, photographed, and when the frames are run together, it appears as if the object is moving. Computers were helping animators move models and ""Go motion"" was born (it was used in 1982's Dragonslayer- resulting in very smooth animation).
Of course, the movie going public LOVED this film, making it a big hit, leading to a 1982 rerelease. I saw this movie in a theater at a 10pm show filled with adults, and the audience cheered, laughed and applauded during the credits. To this day, this remains a popular film.
Yet it also remains one people like to poke fun at. Arnold's LAST ACTION HERO has a scene where a teacher shows her class HAMLET, sarcasticly noting that Lawrence Olivier was in this movie before his ""epic"" CLASH OF THE TITANS. Joke if you must, but the animation scenes in this film rival any in stop motion history. Ray Bradbury picks the Medusa scene as Harryhausen's best.
Based on Greek mythology, the script is actually a love story: a hero tries to save his true love from adversity (in this case titanic monsters). The animation is integrated well into the story, and not just a showplace for Harryhausen's talent.
The film still holds up today, even the effects. When computer animation is done on the cheap, as in many of today's lower budgeted films, it looks cartoony. Stop motion employs a solid object, and is truly amazing if done right.

809797,5,6304111231,"This is my favorite Harry Hamlin movie.  I like when he plays Perseus and has the sword.  I get mad when he loses things, like when he loses his helmet and when he looses his shield.  Just because he kills Medusa doesn't mean he can be careless.  I like when he solves Andromeda's riddle and gets to marry her.  He beats the Kraken like I beat Sephiroth in Final Fantasy 7.  Harry Hamiln should have had a bigger career: this could have been his ""Conan.""  Then he could be governor, too.  If you like Marc Singer in Beastmaster, you'll love Harry Hamlin in this movie.  Also, this movie is on TV sometimes.  If you don't want to buy it right now, you can watch it on TV.  It's probably on right now.  I think you should buy this movie though and pretend that it's on TV.  You can say, ""I think I'll watch some TV, I wonder if Clash of the Titans is on.""

809798,3,6304111231,"As an unabashed Ray Harryhausen fan, I rate this movie three stars with a heavy heart. All his early classics, in my book, rate four or five stars. That's why I personally find it quite sad that this, his last effort, just doesn't quite measure up to his earlier works.
Oh, the stop-motion effects are still first-rate. The winged horse Pegasus, the snake-haired Medusa, the incredibly huge Krakken, all come to life in true rousin' Harryhausen fashion. And as before, they are matted on to the live action scenes with seamless perfection.
So what went wrong this time around? For one thing, the film is too long, almost two hours. Note the lengths of Harryhausen's films over the years: It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955), 80 mins. 20,000,000 Miles to Earth (1957), 84 mins. The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958), 87 mins. Mysterious Island (1961), 101 mins. Jason and the Argonauts (1963), 103 mins. The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1974), 105 mins. Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977), 107 mins. Clash of the Titans (1981), 118 mins. See the pattern? It worked fine right up to Golden Voyage. After that, they simply went too far.
Two hours is actually pretty much the norm nowadays, but in this case, it proves to be too much to handle. Overall, the story plods along at a lazy pace, and as a result, we're left waiting too long for the good stuff: the creature scenes.
The cast doesn't help much either. I imagine that Laurence Olivier didn't much care to include his Zeus role in his resume. He seems to be sleepwalking through his scenes. The same goes for Ursula Andress, Burgess Meredith, and Maggie Smith. It was almost as if they were thinking, hey, Ray Harryhausen is doing the special effects, we don't have to act.
Well of course, it's been said a million times before, Harryhausen's creations are the real stars of his movies. But that's really no excuse for half-hearted acting.
Still and all, Clash of the Titans holds a special place in my heart, if only because it was Harryhausen's swan song. Besides, it's not his fault that the movie didn't turn out that enjoyable. As he always did before, he did an outstanding job.
How outstanding was that? Try naming a movie between 1981 (the year Clash of the Titans was released) and 1992 that featured a gigantic creature brought to life with vivid, jaw-dropping realism. You can't, can you? That's because there were none. That is, until 1993, when Steven Spielberg gave us Jurrasic Park.",1058054400,,2446,4.690697674418605

809800,2,6304111231,"I love ""Clash of the Titans,"" but I'm terribly disappointed by the quality of this DVD.  The ""all-new digital transfer"" that the manufacturer promises is quite possibly the worst transfer I've ever seen, enhancing the film's visual flaws while disguising its merits.  In composite shots, live-action elements are so washed-out as to appear almost black-and-white at times, while stop-motion elements are garishly bright and crisp, looking more like cartoons than dimensional objects.  This is particularly pronounced in shots of the flying Pegasus; the digital transfer so exaggerates the matte lines around the figure that it appears to be a paper cut-out plastered against the sky.  Even the glorious Medusa segment suffers from these defects: what was, in the original (and on VHS), an atmospheric balance of rich darks and flickering red lights, becomes a clash of nearly impenetrable spots of shadow against grainy, pale-brown relief.  I'm no authority on digital transfers, but my guess is that this one was done as quickly and cheaply as possible, the manufacturer's reasoning being (probably) that fans of Harryhausen will be so thrilled to have his films on DVD that they could care less what the films look like.  Well, I was thrilled to have ""Clash of the Titans"" on DVD--but when the abysmal quality of the transfer interferes with the very effects that make the film great, my enthusiasm wanes considerably.  I'd advise fans of Harryhausen to buy the video version, and to write angry letters to the manufacturer protesting their callous desecration of one of the master's greatest films.",1052956800,279,1601,5.206225680933852
809801,4,6304111231,"It's the last and very probably the weakest of all the Harryhausen 'mythy' monster movies, but even a poor Harryhausen film is more entertaining than most. It's amazing how many more people seem to remember this movie above his others, probably because it's more recent and used to be played to death on the cable networks. I was in the RISD museum the other day and mounted next to a painting of Perseus and Andromeda, in way that seemed more than just a little coincidental, was an owl made out of a coconut and covered with metal feathers.
The myth of Perseus has been altered quite a bit, to the point where Perseus isn't so much a hero that earns his way to glory as a 'Daddy's Little Favorite'. Harry Hamlin does as well as...well...Harry Hamlin can be expected and Maggie Smith is unusually unmemorable. Princess Andromeda, while not necessarily the best actress, can be appreciated for the unexpected glimpses of strength and will she brings to the role of what could have been just a weepy damsel in distress. It's hard to maintain your dignity when, at every moment, you're in serious danger of being sucked into the cleft in Harry Hamlin's chin, but she manages quite well.
In comparison to his other features, the special effects here are ratty around the edges and some are obviously on a different type of filmstock. Pegasus looks beautiful in stop-motion, but when it cuts back to the live horse the two look nothing alike. Medusa is spectacular in all her fire-lit, animated glory and is quite possibly the best Harryhausen creature of all time. Bubo the owl is cute in his own way, but he might be too quirky for some.
The score is beautiful, and at times overshadows the movie itself. It's my least favorite Harryhausen film but the soaring music is the only soundtrack that stays with me.
I've read a few complaints about gratuitous nudity, which I assumed to be dancing girls and the like that had been cut from the cable versions I'd seen, but there is actually precious little. There's one shot of a woman breast-feeding, a brief one of a sillouetted mother and child walking nude down the beach, filmed from behind, and one of Andromeda emerging from her bath where there's a tiny three-quarter glimpse of her body that shows relatively nothing before a servant robes her. It's not soft-core porn by any means and the only audience that you should be worried about is the 11-13 set who would find it more juveniley funny than anything. If you don't want your kids seeing it get them 7th Voyage of Sinbad instead, it's actually a better movie and you aren't shown so much as a belly button.
The DVD features are great for the most part; there's a nice interview with Ray featuring all kinds of background info on the filming. The Talent Files are completely lackluster, with only Hamlin, Olivier, and Harryhausen's filmographies featured. Granted, some of the actors in the movie didn't do too much before or after this but leaving out Maggie Smith and Burgess Meredith is perplexing. The Monsters' Gallery is the best bonus by far; more than just a twiddly map of where each monster resides, selecting any creature leads to a lead in, a personalized animated title sequence, and then another Harryhausen interview focusing on the myth of that creature and some neat tidbits about why they were in the film and how they were animated.",1051747200,4,3356,4.709183673469388
809802,5,6304111231,"CLASH OF THE TITANS will always have a special place in my heart as one of those films that completely enthralled me as a kid.  I must have seen this movie a good 5 times in the movie theater  and couldn't wait to get my hands (finally!) on the DVD many years later.
I've always been fascinated with Greek mythology and this film - along with the classic JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS - fed that fascination.  I enjoyed it then as much as I enjoy it now, even with it's few faults.
The story of Prince Perseus (Harry Hamlin) - as he embarks to fulfill his destiny and marry the Princess Adromeda - is filled with wonderful characters, great special effects (courtesy of genius Ray Harryhausen), great actors and an enjoyable plot.  Perseus' path is strewn with danger (thanks to Thetis and her vengeful son Kalibos) as he faces the Stygian witches, Medusa (one of the most memorable and suspenseful scenes in movie history), Kalibos and the Kraken. Acting legends Laurence Olivier (Zeus), Maggie Smith (Thetis), Sian Philips (Cassiopeia)and Burgess Meredith (Ammon)  provide ample star power to balance that of newcomer Hamlin and the lovely Judi Bowker (Andromeda). Also featured are Pegasus and Bo-bo (an owl the  kids would enjoy).
I've enjoyed watching this film over and over again and would highly recommend this Greekfeast to fans of action/adventure or Greek mythology.  The cast is strong eventhough Burgess Meredith is often saddled with redundant comments like ""a gift from the Gods!"" Harry Hamlin and Judi Bowker shine as the hero and heroine.  The special effects may appear a bit dated (this was made in 1981, when stop-motion animation still ruled the day) but Mr. Harryhausen never disappoints.
I highly recommend this film and also suggest you check out the original JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS and 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD (starring Kerwin Matthews and Kathryn Grant) - 2 more rousing fantasy adventure tales from Ray Harryhausen.  And if you haven't yet seen any Ray Harryhausen films, now is your chance to see one.  This man, after all, inspired two young men named Peter Jackson and George Lucas into film directing and special effects.",1047859200,,2144,4.897790055248619
809813,4,6304111231,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and being enthralled by it - not to mention scared to death by the 'Medusa scene'. So that statement of course makes me biased to the point of nostalgia, but I'll review this anyway. I'm also a 'fan' of Greek/Roman/Norse mythology, so seeing all these mythological creatures was an added treat. While this film is very good, simply because of it's easy-to-follow familiar plot and uncomplicated characters, it pales in comparison to 'Jason and the Argonauts' which enthralls me more today than it did when I saw it as a kid (though I always like the giant stone golem guy in J&tA). So in conclusion, I liked 'Clash of the Titans' less today than when I first saw it, mainly because now I appreciate better acting, deeper characters, and more complex plotlines, but there is a certain 'innocence' in it that almost makes up for all that, you just have to lose yourself in it.",1046822400,,920,4.581818181818182
809814,5,6304111231,"1981: Ray Harryhousen made the special effects, monsters and clay ""creations"" for this Greek epic myth about the heroic deeds of Perseus. Harryhousen had previously made the magic possible for such films as ""Jason and the argonauts"", another film revolving a Greek myth, and the sci-fi classic ""Earth vs. the flying saucers."" Harry Hamlin, tv actor from the 80's series L.A. Law (and a hot hunk I had a crush on as a girl), makes an impressive performance as the confident, toga-wearing, muscle-bound, swordsman Perseus, who defeats monsters, including the three headed dog from Hell and the sea monster Kraken.
British actress Dame Maggie Smith (from Sister Act films and Hook) and the esteemed British actor Laurence Olivier play the roles of the goddess Thetis and Zeus, who are involved in a bitter feud. Zeus protects Perseus, as he is his son by a mortal woman, but Thetis is upset that Zeus shows no mercy to the deformed Calabos, her son, who was once a handsome prince. Calabos has the princess Andromeda (Claire Bloom) under a dark spell. She will be married to the man who solves the nightly riddles she is given. Perseus solves the riddle and becomes engaged to Andromeda. But when the queen Cassiopeia elevates her daughter's beauty above that of their patron goddess Thetis, Thetis becomes so enraged she puts Andromeda in a tight spot. She will be the sacrificial victim for the hunger of the sea monster, the Kraken. Perseus journeys to the Underworld, defeates the snake-haired Medusa and with his friends, the old wise man, the winged white horse Pegasus and a robotic owl (who chirps and buzzes almost like R2D2 in Star Wars). He frees Andromeda, who as the classical myth dictates, was chaind to a rock by the sea, and  the ending is a very happy one.
Thanks to the fine acting by Harry Hamlin, whose heroism comes through as shining as Perseus (not to mention his good looks), Andromeda (Claire Bloom), Maggie Smith as the vindictive goddess and Zeus (Laurence Olivier) as an eloquent, authoritarian king of the gods. The London Symphony Orchestra fills the soundtrack with  lofty themes, romantic melody and dramatic highlights. One of these highlights is the moment when Perseus tames Pegasus. This film was a classic in the 80's and is still great to watch, especially with the magic of DVD.  A must have for fantasy fans, a great addition to fantasy films. Look for ""Jason and the Argonauts"" with Harryhausen effects, equally a match to this film, although dating from an earlier time, the 60's.",1044489600,5,2520,4.869463869463869

809816,4,6304111231,"Judging from the comments below, it seems one either loves this film or despises it. In the book ""Roger Ebert's Movie Home Companion"", Mr. Ebert praised the film, so I decided to give this DVD a try. I'm glad I took a chance because it turns out Mr. Ebert's opinion matches my own. If you harbor a child's spirit within you, if you like to entertain fantasies, or enjoy comic books, this film is probably for you.

Ebert says ""Clash Of The Titans"" is special effects wizard, Ray Harryhausen's masterwork, a tour de force, and having seen many of the master's earlier films, I tend to agree. His effects are achieved by stop-action animation, rear projection, modeling, etc.; traditional methods requiring painstaking effort and which lend themselves well to a film which deals with ancient Greek mythology. But there is much more here than just fantastic effects. Nearly everything about this film works for me. The mostly British cast infuses the film with a high tone. Harry Hamlin plays the role of Persius exactly right, and Judi Bowker is adorable as the lovely princess Andromeda. The production values are high, with wondrous sets and marvelous costuming. The location filming in the Mediterranean is beautiful and sometimes breathtaking.
The DVD video transfer is from a clean 35mm print and looks terrific in the 16:9 widescreen mode. The sumptuous London Symphony scoring sets a tasteful mood and effectively augments the story. I do have one gripe, however. The music track on this DVD has too much treble and the music is too loud, competing with the dialog. Whoever remixes these soundtracks should be instructed that the music is not supposed to upstage the acting.
Apart from the sound mix, I honestly can't find much to fault with the film. This ages-old epic of gods and men, good vs. evil, and fantastic ordeals braved in the name of love, is treated with respect, both in script and acting, while remaining fun. Titans is an enchanting movie. It evokes a certain sense of magic which films like Star Wars seem to have sacrificed in the name of urbane sophistication and high-tech realism. This DVD is a fine choice for those who like a touch of charm with their escapism; a gem to be enjoyed again and again, by young and old, for it truly celebrates the child within.",1043798400,27,2287,4.804568527918781

CLASH OF THE TITANS tells the story of young Perseus (Harry Hamlin - TV's ""L.A. Law""), the illegitimate son of the god Zeus (Laurence Olivier).  Perseus discovers his ultimate destiny when he is mysteriously transported to the city of Joppa.  There, he learns of the fair Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker), who is doomed to live her life challenging suitors with impossible riddles, given to her by the deformed Calibos.
Perseus solves her riddle, and is about to marry her, when the angered patron goddess of Joppa, Thetis (Maggie Smith), denounces the union and orders that Andromeda be chained to the foot of the sacrificial stone in a month's time, to be fed to the last of the Titans, the Kraken.
Perseus must find a way to defeat the Kraken, and sets off on a perilous quest to discover the answer...
Gorgeous romantic-adventure.  Laurence Rosenthal's score perfectly captures the mood of the movie.  Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion effects look quite obvious in this new digital age, but serve their purpose wonderfully.

809833,3,6304111231,"""Clash of the Titans"" is an enteraining film that is based upon the mythological Greek hero Perseus (played by Harry Hamlin), but the film strays from the original Greek story and much of the acting in the film is wooden, especially Harry Hamlin, whose acting abilities in this early role were definitely not as good as later works. Judi Bowker was equally wooden in her portrayal of Andromeda.  By far the best acting in the film is from Maggie Smith, who plays Andromeda's mother Thetis, but it's not one of her better performances.  Lawrence Olivier's portrayal of Zeus was over the top.
In the original Greek story, Perseus sets off to capture the head of Medusa as a wedding present for Polydectes, the King of Seriphos, who demands it from him when Perseus arrives at the wedding without a gift.  The God Hermes gives Perseus his winged shoes and a sickle to kill Medusa.  The Goddess Athena gives Perseus a reflective shield to protect him and to use as a mirror so that he won't look directly at Medusa.  Athena directs Perseus to visit the Graeae, three women who share one eye, to find out how to find the Nymphs of the North.  He does so, so that he can obtain the Cap of Darkness (which makes the wearer invisible) and the Magic Wallet (to keep the head of Medusa).  The Nymphs of the North also tell Perseus how to get to Medusa's layer.  Perseus flies to Medusa's layer using the winged shoes, kills her and takes her head.  He is attacked by Medusa's sisters, but he escapes.  During Perseus' return flight to Seriphos with the head of Medusa, he has many other adventures, including seeing a woman tied to a rock at the sea (whom he at first thinks is a statue).  He flies to her and she tells him that her name is Andromeda and that she is being punished because her mother boasted that she was more beautiful than the Nereids (sea nymphs).  The God Poseidon was angered and said that Andromeda must be sacrificed to the sea monster Cetus.  As they are talking, Cetus emerges from the sea, but Perseus pulls out the head of Medusa and kills Cetus.  Perseus returns Andromeda to her father, King Cepheus of Phonecia, where he asks to marry her and the king accepts.  Perseus and Andromeda (with the head of Medusa in tow) fly off to Seriphos, where he uses the head of Medusa to turn Polydectis and his wedding guests to stone.  Perseus & Andromeda live happily ever after, until Perseus is killed by Dionysus.
""Clash of the Titans"" used a lot of poetic license to reshape the story of Perseus:
1. Perseus' need to get the head of Medusa is strictly to save Andromeda and never includes the Polydectes portion of the story.
2. Perseus uses the winged horse Pegasus to fly instead of the winged shoes of Hermes.
3. Perseus uses a sword from Athena instead of Hermes' sickle.  4. The film includes a comical, mechanical owl companion for Perseus, which is never mentioned in the original Greek story.  5. Thetis (Andromeda's mother) says that Andromeda is more beautiful than the Goddess Hera, not the Nereids.  (Hera would not have sought the help of Poseidon to punish Andromeda, she would have punished her herself.)
6. The film uses a sea monster called the kraken instead of Cetus.  The kraken comes from Norse mythology and is usually portrayed as a giant octopus, not a bipedal humanoid underwater giant as shown in the film.  I guess the film's director preferred the name kraken to Cetus.
If you plan to watch this film to learn about Greek mythology, read the original Greek stories instead; but if you just want to be entertained with campy acting and special effects, this film can do just that.",1030320000,13,3621,4.591614906832298
809834,5,6304111231,"The great Ray Harryhausen considered this his ""swan song"". He did not disappoint his vast community of fans. Director Desmond Davis has assembled a great cast with a fine narrative script which puts lots of complicated stuff in a coherent fashion. Harry Hamlin is perfectly buff and handsome and Judi Bowker is as gorgeous as they come. Perfect! The great Gods are no less than Laurence Olivier, Claire Bloom and Maggie Smith. Ursula Andress is also there; doesn't do much, but she plays Aphrodite, and this IS a family film! She's stunning after all these years. Maggie Smith, in particular, is effective when she plays nasty characters, and she doesn't disappoint. The photography of Ted Moore is somewhat faded on this DVD version, not as clear and crisp as I recall when I saw it in the theatre. There are 3 witches, one of whom is the great Flora Robson, but the make-up was so fine and the direction so taut, you didn't know who was whom. It didn't matter. A great scene of rapid-fire dialogue. Charles H. Schneer produced all those Sinbad movies in a wide 2.35:1 widescreen; this was in 1.85:1 LBX. I like widescreen. The real star is Ray Harryhausen. His interpretation of Medusa is the best imaginable. Also Cerberus (the 2-headed dog) actually was supposed to have 3 heads...but who's counting..? The Harryhausen effects are the star...don't forget the scorpions that grow from Medusa's bloody head. Cool. If acting honors go out, they should go to Maggie Smith, in the minor role of Thetis. The only thing missing from this film was that Zeus did nothing to her at the end. (He should've done something...she was a real meanie). Check this out. True escapist fare. One of my faves. One interesting movie fact: the following year, 1982, Harry Hamlin played a gay character in ""Making Love"", directed by Arthur Hiller. A fine film. It hurt his career.

809836,4,6304111231,"When Clash of the Titans was first announced, it promised much more than any film could possibly deliver. You may not be able to go home again, but you sure can give it a good try. While parts of Clash do measure up to Harryhausen's classic Jason and The Argonauts, the film is a bit uneven. The strong cast and imagative blocking by Desmond Davis does add to the strong quality of the best sequences.
Lawrence Olivier should have played Zeus ages ago. Here's an actor drunk with both the role and his position in cinema (and stage). He chews the scenery well and makes even the most tedious scenes enjoyable. The laser backdrop that greets us when we first see Zeus says it all. Burgess Meredith, Maggie Smith and Harry Hamlin make a feast of their meagerly underwritten roles. All three do an admirable job throughout the film acting against the backdrop of Harryhausen's stop motion animation and effects work.
Can't help but wonder why the horrible matte job with Posideon releasing the Krakan was left in. In a movie with so many marvelous effects one has to wonder how this poorly done sequence was overlooked.
The animation of Pegues top is a career high for Harryhausen. He manages to invest life into a character that would be the undoing of most effects people. His work is both breaktaking and original. The section involving Medusa and Calibos are also quite impressive and engaging. The later sequences involve both stop action work and a an actor. The ambitious sequences work well and are integrated into the finished production with care.
I suppose the most important aspect to this film is the love of Greek mythology that Harryhausen brings to the project. Clearly Clash was a labor of love much like Jason and the first Sinbad adventure. While many artists (and make no doubt about it Harryhausen is an artist) revisit the past and manage only to dredge up the memories of former glories, Harryhausen manages to create new ones as well. Despite its flaws, Clash demonstrates that Harryhausen went out at the top of his game.
The screenplay by longtime collaborator Beverly Cross is almost the equal of his work for Jason. The late Cross manages to integrate a wide variety of characters from Greek mythology into a coheren narrative that works very well. A pity that Cross didn't work on the last Sinbad installment as the lack of a strong screenplay (and actor in the title role) undermined that film.
The characters of the Greek gods are surprisingly true to legend (perhaps not since Cross was a classical scholar)and while some of the mortals are little more than stock characters with little elaboration on motivation, they move the story forward. Although not as involving (or accurate ) as the work Cross did on Jason twenty years before, the script does its job of putting the characters through the paces and rolls us along to the next action sequence. That's better than most Hollywood hacks are able to do today.
The direction is fairly sharp but not quite as tight or consistent as in Jason (although an improvement over Nathan Juran and Sam Wanamaker's work on the Sinbad films)Veteran director Desmond Davis does an admirable job given the circumstances. Some of the sequences are a bit clumsy in set up (and I'm not entirely sure that was Davis' fault)but, on the whole, Davis' mise en scene works well. I'm happy that Star Wars and Close Encounters created an environment where Columbia was willing to gamble on another Harryhausen epic even if the result was wanting. Clash is great entertainment for both children and adults regardless of its minor flaws.
The extras on the DVD are great. Although I would have loved to see test footage and outttakes of the animation sequences, it's clear that Harryhausen wants some of the magic to remain. In a film obsessed culture where every one wants to know everything about the making of a film, Harryhausen's attitude is a refreshing change.",1028419200,7,3921,4.8017751479289945
809837,5,6304111231,"When CLASH OF THE TITANS was first released theatrically it was an across-the-board success. It just wasn't popular with followers of the genre but with the general public. It contained elements of the fantastic, Greek Mythology and most importantly it contained a story of young love told with genuine prose and passion. This is Ray Harryhausen's last full-length feature to date. It does not contain the awe-inspiring creatures or the sweep of JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. It does not contain the eerie landscapes and esoteric feeling of isolation of MYSTERIOUS ISLAND. What CLASH OF THE TITANS has is the romanticism of its catalytic love story and also the romanticism for an era of filmmaking coming to an end. Harry Hamlin's performance, as Perseus is one of nobility and character, not cynicism. Laurence Olivier as Zeus shows us a god with a conscience manipulating events for the manifestation of mortal man's better qualities. Harryhausen's Pegasus shows us that man has the ability to control the creatures of the fantastic, tame them and use them for what is good in the universe. Laurence Rosenthal's heavenly score floats like an ethereal mist with its gossamer tonalities in somewhat a homage to Ray Harryhausen, the late composer Bernard Herrmann but ultimately to the romantic images and the eternal story of man's devotion to love found in CLASH OF THE TITANS.",1026604800,3,1374,5.084070796460177
809838,4,6304111231,"This campy little masterpiece from 1981 is, as many reviews have already pointed-out, just a whole lot of fun, particularly to audiences who were young at the time when the film was originally released.
True, modern computer graphics are more sophisticated in their animation and compositing alongside real footage, but they lack the texture and feel of the older stop-motion animation models. Today the look of this film is somewhat ""camp"", but that is a positive feature, not a negative one. Somehow the old-fashioned techniques work when used in a mythological setting of a civilization that is so ancient. And they hold-up better than some critics would admit.
It's a shame that the real climax of this film (and the best part of the story) is the confrontation with Medusa, which happens about three-quarters of the way through the movie. The end battle with the Kraken pales in comparison to Perseus's killing of the serpent headed Medusa. With her serpent headed bows and the hissing rattle of her tail; the eery score, and the tenseness of the situation - this is a wonderfully filmed segment!
True, this may not be an acedemic interpretation of Greek mythology per/se, but it is highly entertaining, and never claims to be anything more. My hunch is that if we were to take Homer out of the stuffy classroom and go back in time and witness a telling of the Illiad in Ancient Greece, we would note that it is told in the same fun-loving spirit as we see in The Clash of the Titans, with the audience clinging to their seats, longing to hear more.",1026259200,2,1554,4.7380073800738005

I've been kinda bummed with many fantasy films (thankfully Lord of the Rings came out and was excellent) because so many of them have turned out to be rather mediocre. Clash of the Titans is not one of them though. it is a great film that mixes in the mythology with special effects rather well. obviously the effects are quite outdated in our modern CG world, but the story is still quite strong.",1023148800,,452,4.392857142857143
809840,4,6304111231,"CLASH OF THE TITANS is not a film to watch if you want to learn about Greek mythology. The movie (though closer to those tales than Disney's HERCULES) is filled with a hodge-podge of all kinds of Greek myths tied together with a bit of Nordic legend as well. However, this is a film that was made for fun. The cast looks like the had fun making the movie, Ray Harryhausen had to have a ton of fun with all the effects, and the movie is fun to watch.
The plot is too convoluted to go into detail. However, the basics are this. Perseus is a son of Zeus, though he doesn't know it. Hera, Thetis, and most of the other gods on Olympus don't care for Zeus' favor of this son and are prepared to do everything they can to stop him from ""fulfilling his destiny"" in marrying the beautiful Princess Andromeda and becoming King of Joppa, including releasing the last Titan, Kraken, who is caged beneath the sea in Poseidon's realm. Andromeda's people and her life are threatened and Perseus must go on a grand quest and a journey of self discovery.
The film has an impressive cast including Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, and Burgess Meredith. Also, a great deal has been made over the special effects. Sure the effects are cheesy by today's standards. However, when the movie was made stop motion animation was still a standard (STAR WARS only came out a few years before TITANS was released). Not only that, but Ray Harryhausen was the master of monster creation and this movie was his swan song.
A fun and imaginative film that is really entertaining to watch especially on a rainy day.",1018137600,14,1580,4.508710801393728

Or at least will eventually. ^_^

There are flaws but as long as you can't take the movie seriously.  Just sit back enjoy it.  It's also nice to see a very prestigious cast have fun with the melodrama of their roles.  fans of the Harry Potter films will enjoy looking back at Maggie Smith as the almost villainous sea goddess.

In my opinion, if a movie can bring about a feeling of great imagination, interesting plot twists, AND teach you about the history of a culture's basis then you have a movie of great proportions. To me Clash of the Titans brought about all of this. Mythology and Greece have always been a large facination for me, and to see many of the Greek myths fleshed out on the big screen was a true piece of magic. Movie buffs will be pleased to see many Hollywood actors in this gem as well. From Laurence Olivier and Harry Hamlin, to Maggie Smith and Burgess Meredith. Considering the time in which the movie was made, the special effects were outstanding as well. Even the imaginary characters of Medusa, Cerberus, Pegasus, Calibos, and the Crikon stand out and bring quite a bit of humanism to a very fictional film.

The plot of the movie still holds up OK, but the special effects seem extremely dated by today's standards. They were probably above average for the early 80s.
The movie is a ""coming of age"" story of Perseus. The movie starts with his mother Danae and the infant Perseus being exiled by the king. Zeus is upset and destroys the kingdom. Perseus is tested in lots of ways and ends up marrying the beautiful woman (of course).
Acting is above average at times, below average at times. But it's still fun to watch once in a while. Another greek myth that is pretty well done is the modern (2000) Jason and the Argonauts that was on NBC by Hallmark entertainment. It's better overall and the central theme of that movie is clearer and cleaner. The DVD also has some nice extras on it.",994636800,,910,4.390532544378698

Medusa's head of snakes, the sea monster, scorpions, vultures, statues that talk, sea monsters,etc. I always wondered how the special effects back in the early 80's were so good and so realistic and today with all the technology I don't see movies that are as well done. The movie is a great romance and the story is well written and I learned alot about Greek mythology from it.",994291200,2,707,4.664
809862,4,6304111231,"That was the thought going through my mind when Perseus arrived at the Isle of the Dead.  Growing up, this movie was my favorite when it came on HBO (which was pretty often since HBO was pretty new in the early 80s).  My brother would tell me that I watched it every time it came on (and I probably did).
All in all, I think the mythology was pretty good (on a basis of look and not necessarily true accuracy -- I believe Pegasus was born from Medusa when Perseus killed her).  The whole Isle of the Dead sequence was my definite favorite (that and the scene when the statue of Thetis' head came off and then the face came alive).  Medusa was very creepy and Harryhausen's animation were perfect for her.  Makes me wish the old stop motion effects would come back again -- it might be more expensive than computers but it has a certain ... depth and texture to it ...  Of course I'm waiting with bated breath for the ""Final Fantasy"" movie to come out and ""Shrek"" was fabulous too ...
There was more nudity in the movie than I previously remembered but then my recent viewing was the first since the 80s, so I probably wouldn't have noticed it back then.  It's amazing though what they used to be able to show in a 'PG' movie.  Not that there was a ton of nudity or anything like that for those reading this and gasping in shock at the prospect of their kids seeing oodles of flesh.  It was all tastefully done and brief glimpses ...
Anyway, I think this review is getting away from me so I better stop ... All in all I think this ranks right up there with the other Harryhausen classics (like ""Golden Voyage of Sindbad"", ""Sindbad & the Eye of the Tiger"", and ""Jason & Argonauts"").

And I cannot stand how people say that this is essentially a special-effects vehicle for Harryhausen's work. Remember, a script comes first without knowledge if it will ever be made, let alone who would be selected to create the special-effects! There are not too many ""monsters"" in the film either.
