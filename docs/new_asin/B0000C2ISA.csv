How pleasing to have so many of his favourite songs on one disc!!

With the toe tapping ""turn me up turn me down turn me loose"" to the haunting ""aint that lonely yet""the bouncy ""pocket of a clown"" & what about the fabulous ""thousand miles from nowhere"" the latter would have to be one of the best video clips ever,just a milesstone of dvd entertainment

In a word--brilliant!!",1176076800,2,488,4.46067415730337

1910098,5,B0000C2ISA,"Dwight Yoakam is a country star with multi-faceted talent, and he shines in these videos from 1990-94 as a songwriter, singer, musician, inimitable performer and actor; Yoakam wrote or co-wrote 8 of the 11 songs, and some of them include his unique floorshow moves in his seemingly glued-on jeans, and interspersed between a few of the songs are vignettes where he gets to use some of his acting skills.
Favorite tracks include the Elvis hit ""Suspicious Minds"", ""It Only Hurts When I Cry"", ""A Thousand Miles From Nowhere"", and ""Pocket of a Clown""; all these songs have terrific melodies, good visuals, and are very entertaining. ""Ain't That Lonely Yet"" was a # 1 single and won a 1993 Best Country Vocal Performance Grammy.
The CDs with these songs are: Track # 1 is on the U.K. release ""La Croix d'Amour"" (1992), tracks 2-6 are on ""If There was a Way"" (1990), and tracks 7-11 are on ""This Time"" (1993).

1910101,5,B0000C2ISA,"Released in 1994, the ""Pieces of Time"" video is a collection of 11 music videos from '90-'94, including: ""Suspicious Minds,"" ""The Heart That You Own,"" ""Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose,"" ""Takes A Lot To Rock You,"" ""You're The One,"" ""It Only Hurts When I Cry,"" ""Ain't That Lonely Yet,"" ""A Thousand Miles From Nowhere,"" ""Fast As You,"" ""Try Not To Look So Pretty,"" and ""Pocket Of A Clown.""  The videos are linked by a series of vignettes that are both amusing and revealing.  Not just a pouty country music singer, Yoakam has a sense of humor - and humor is what he uses to bring to light what goes on in his (somewhat twisted) mind.  This is a great collection of music videos plus the chance to see the comedic side of Dwight Yoakam we don't usually experience through his songs.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",973209600,107,804,4.448979591836735
