=)
two thumbs up!",939254400,5,143,4.538461538461538
858718,3,6304372612,The Acting was great.....The story could have been a little better.....The Music???? what in the heck was that music??? You cant run a story that is part native and play ordinary music!! The music is the basis for pulling you into a story...it enhances the action of a scene or emotion....The music that was playing was a disgrace....I like Marrice Jarres Music but NOT for this film....BAD choice! The beginning was a mess....a cop car transporting a prisoner and driving like crazy??....didn't get it. The whole thing was good as a concept but lost it in between parts....,1373846400,,574,4.86734693877551
858719,5,6304372612,"The word ""Serendipity"" is what would describe my relationship with this movie.  I just happened to stumble upon it one night and thought it would be ""typical"" Woody.  How wrong I was and how glad I am.  I love this flick.  What absolutely powerful performances by Mr. Harrelson and Jon Seda. Of course, I consider the cameo by Talisa Soto one of the best in American movie history (or her-story).  Splendid, stunning intense and funny in a real-life sense, this movie is one of the great underrated and unexpectedly moving I have ever seen.",1373328000,,540,4.702127659574468
858720,5,6304372612,I loved every minute of this movie.  It follows the life of a young Native American Indian man ( Jon Seda ) a prisoner who frees himself only to take a hostage ( Woody Harrelson ) on a journey that will offer him his freedom from jail life.  This movie belongs to Seda...he's excellent all the way through.  I could not take my eyes off him...he's that good.  The story unfolds...slowly but surely...and by the end....both men have a change of life...and understand the true meaning of friendship.  Highly recommended!,1360972800,,518,4.711111111111111
858721,5,6304372612,One of my favorite all-time movies! Movie is just what I expected. Good quality. I reccommend this product very much! Thank you,1358640000,,127,4.818181818181818
858722,5,6304372612,"Michael Cimino really has no luck sometimes. Despite all his talents, the financial flops he's helmed over the years continue to overshadow all of his artistic triumphs. Most of materials on this film deal chiefy with the fact that it flopped disastrously at the box office and say little to nothing about the work itself. Most will probably write it off as a footnote in a once-powerful director's increasingly stagnant career, but a few will no doubt wonder 'What about the film itself? Does it really deserve obscurity?'

As it turns out, the film itself functions as a fairly straightforward, yet impecabbly executed and never boring, road movie. Spirituality lies at the center of this offbeat film, which comes as a surprise for Cimino. Most of his films revolve around gritty realism and moral struggles that border on the Herculean, so for him to deal with this subject matter feels quite refreshing. The script, helmed by Charles Leavitt of ""Blood Diamond"" and ""K-Pax"" fame, never loses track of the central quest and keeps the film moving when it could have simply navel-gazed. Lastly, Cimino brings all of the natural grandeur and idiosyncratic melodrama that made him famous in the first place. He shoots the desert and mountain vistas as if they were the sublime incarnate or, more fittingly, the sacred spaces which the Navajo characters revere them as being.

All in all, this film will probably only ever be truly appreciated by cinephiles. Still, one can only hope that more and more free-thinking aesthetes venture beyond ""The Deer Hunter"" and appreciate the beauty found in this film, as well as the rest of Cimino's collective works.",1280102400,3,1653,4.9855072463768115
858723,5,6304372612,"As far as I'm concerned, this movie is the ultimate b***hslap in the face of any of these ""new"" militant atheists, but enough negativity.  This movie is the ultimate Native American campfire story.  I've watched it maybe twenty times since it first came out and it still heals my soul in a grandiose way.  The two main actors are both excellent at what they do and especially in this movie.  This film appears to have been made on a low budget, but this should not be an issue for those who can appreciate fine art, as the acting is top notch and the characters are nearly 100% believable as their roles.  If I were to teach a course on religion I would definitely play this film (and the Devil's Advocate) for the class.  I thought that it wouldn't ever make it to DVD but alas, here'tis.  I advise potential viewers to not be reactant during the story until they can at least reach the second half, where the film starts making sense in a more intelligent way.",1259107200,2,962,4.401129943502825
858724,5,6304372612,"I watched this movie when it 1st came out on VHS. Same year when DVD was just a newborn. Wow! Its been that long. Anyway, this is an awesome movie. Woody Harrelson was great and Jon Seda was excellent. Seda was very convincing. Awesome!",1248480000,3,236,4.386363636363637
858725,5,6304372612,"If you do not give this movie 5 stars, then you have lived a very sheltered life, without heartbreak, or you are just heartless. As a nurse who worked in hospice, it is a wonderful touching portrayal of a dying man's journey to his end.  It is presented in such a way that you do not know what to expect next, even if you are experienced with the dying process.  The storyline is unique, and the acting is great.  What in the world can you find wrong with this movie?  I am only disappointed Anne Bancroft's part is not bigger, and that it has not been released on DVD.  It was also not publicized.  If you have not given this movie a chance, or did not like it because Woody was not funny, reconsider....get a box of kleenex, grow up and realize that not everyone can live a charmed life...sometimes life is just sad, and if you can continue to look for the ""medicine man"", and look for the good in life....Blessed Be.....",1163376000,6,923,4.30635838150289
858726,4,6304372612,"After watching ""Sunchaser"", I realize that Woody Harrelson and Jon Seda are TWO VERY UNDER-RATED actors. Acting is, after all, about believability; pursuading the viewer that you are who you SAY you are. Within the first 15 minutes of this movie I believed every word out of these two actor's mouths. Jon Seda is FLAWLESS as a terminally ill, escaped convict, who kidnaps a doctor (Woody Harrelson) in order to make a great journey to a mystical healing lake. Makes for a pretty good flick. Watch it at least once, you'll probably like it.",995068800,11,539,4.74468085106383
7869535,2,6304372612,"I didn't care for the acting, a bit overdone. As for the subject matter, I felt it tries too hard to be meaningful and when all the focus is on the effort rather than the goal, one misses the mark entirely.  I love Woody Harrelson but this just didn't do it for me.  Very contrived.",1515283200,,282,4.109090909090909

7869540,5,6304372612,A very underrated movie. The acting is exceptional.  Seda is a young incarcerated Native American who is dying but has a dream. Harrelson is a young doctor with a secret.  Their lives are very different and they live by different rules but when they cross paths everything changes for both of them.,1424995200,,298,4.711538461538462
