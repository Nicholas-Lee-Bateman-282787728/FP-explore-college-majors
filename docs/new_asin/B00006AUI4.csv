1739274,5,B00006AUI4,"You can teach a dog to jump through a hoop, but what these sharks do is pure survival instinct.  It's well worth any shark lovers time to watch these two documentaries back-to-back so as to gain an appreciation for the evolutionary science that has been employeed to capture these scenes.  The first movie establishes that this not only occurs, but on a very frequent basis in South Africa.  The second movie expands on this by taking what they know of this extraordinary feeding habit and testing it in California and Australia, where breeching is far less common.  The results are a greater understanding of this mysterious sharks true feeding habits.  Most people are only aware of sharks breeching water from the fake photo that surfaced about a year or two ago, with the great white appearing to attack a navy seal being hoisted back into a helicopter.  Watch this film and you will see that the truth is far more amazing than the fictious myths.",1054166400,5,951,4.733333333333333
1739275,5,B00006AUI4,"This is one of the best Documentary movie ever made about the Great White Shark. Since I am a big fan of this shark, and seen lots of movies and documentaries, I never thought that these guys can fly so high in order to catch their preys. For the first time, you can watch a huge 15-foot white shark flies in the air with a seal in its jaws!!
This feature contains ""Air Jaws (Sharks of South Africa)"" & ""Air Jaws 2 (Even Higher)"". The Discovery channel has spent a whole year to make this film, shooting in South Africa, South Australia and California, all 3 places home of the white shark.
If you are a big fan like me, than do not hesitate to buy it.
A MUST!!",1032480000,5,661,4.131782945736434

1739297,5,B00006AUI4,"This past summer, my father and I traveled to South Africa and visited Simon's Town.  After asking at the local tourist information station about seeing the sharks, we were given Rob Lawrence's cell phone number.  Long story short, we were able to spend a day out on Chris and Rob's boat watching the great whites attack the seals in the ""Circle of Death"" around Seal Island.  Rob (who is in the video) provided us with a wonderful morning and afternoon full of excitement and education.  The video I shot during our visit, I love, but it is nowhere near the quality of the footage here, obviously.  At one point, I made the comment, ""Gee...this is a lot like fishing"", indicating that there is a whole lot of waiting for the sharks to show up.  This video is all of the good parts, without the cold wind, listing boat, and smell of chum.",1105660800,,838,4.480263157894737
1739298,5,B00006AUI4,I suggest you change your DVD player -- there are many on the market which are cheap and are region free. I continually send DVD's to my sister in the UK from the states and she really has no problem.,1092441600,2,200,4.025
1739299,5,B00006AUI4,"I love this dvd there is just plenty of info on it. The things in this video are oh so cool, or brutal like hell. This movie gets a rock solid 5, no matter what. No joke I would get it no matter what, and i did. I hope the hold world will buy this.",1089158400,,248,3.5272727272727273
1739300,5,B00006AUI4,"If you love watching shark videos like I do then you simply HAVE to see this.  1 ton sharks leaping clean out of the water to chase seals.  It's an awsome video to watch.  There's even a scene where a shark is about to fly out of the water chasing a seal but slams into the side of the scientists' boat.
I had no idea this occured until I was surfing the web earlier this year and came across pictures of Great Whites breeching.  Jaws discouraged people from swimming, this might discourage you from boating!",1086998400,7,508,4.315789473684211
1739301,5,B00006AUI4,"This was a highly intriguing and informative documentary detailing white shark predatory activity in the South African waters.  As a shark fanatic, I would definitely recommend this dvd.  The ""breaching"" phenomenon is well discussd and the aerial maneouverability displayed by such large marine-dwelling fish is truly acrobatic and amazing.  The strategies evolved by both predator and prey are well detailed.  Air Jaws 2 further illustrates this breaching or flying out of the water manouevers used by the sharks in capturing their more agile and elusive  prey.  I was also impressed at how quickly my delivery was sent from the time I had ordered it.  Thankyou AMAZON.CA",1083801600,2,672,5.283018867924528
1739302,5,B00006AUI4,"I am so glad I purchased this DVD! I have watched it several times and I am always impressed with the prospect of 1 ton Great Whites hurling themselves out of the water in an effort to catch a their prey. Alot of the images showen in this video have never before been filmed. Obviously the airobatics of the sharks as well as a great white feeding friendsy with a whale as the main course. Simply amazing to watch, and having seen hundreds of videos about sharks and Great Whites specifically, I can say that this has been the most informative documentary I have watched on the subject!",1067817600,5,586,4.435185185185185
1739303,5,B00006AUI4,"First of all I have to admit that my interest in Great White Sharks was solely triggered by the movie Jaws. On the negative side, this classic film kept me out of the waters for some time, but on the positive side it led me to read as many books as I can get my hands on, and watch every documentary on TV, fascinated by this wonderful, still largely mysterious and misunderstood fish.
What I learned thoughout the years was very compelling,
this survivor of the dinosaur age is not the brainless killing machine Jaws portrayed it to be in a sensational and not totally accurate way, but a much more sophisticated animal than previously thought.
But not the dozens of books I read,nor the numerous documentaries I watched prepared me for what I saw in Air Jaws, the best documentary on Great Whites ever done!
I watched in sheer disbelief, fear and fascination as this giant 6-8 foot fish with a large toothy grin  'breached' the waters off Seal Island in South Africa( in an area appropriately named the 'Kill Zone') all of it, from snout to tail and pounced on a very unlucky seal! Over and over again, the Great White literaly 'flew' out of the waters to get at its doomed victim, and each time I was totally transfixed!!
There is another very chilling scene where one of the researchers/scientists jumps on the floating carcass of a whale in the middle of very murky waters, while about 6 or 7 Great Whites are in a crazed feeding frenzy!! This was the stuff of any horror or thriller movie you could wish to enjoy!
If, like me, you are interested in this beautiful fish, or you want to watch a documentary that has as much excitement and thrills as any film, then this DVD is a must buy, and I am sure you will,like me, be totally captivated by the sheer power, and mystery of the Great White Shark..A documentary that will have your heart pounding without John Williams's score..nothing short of  a great achievement!!",1066867200,5,1924,4.54178674351585
7966522,4,B00006AUI4,It was a gift 4 someone who likes among other things Sharks.  I read many reviews here on Amazon to decide to buy this in particular.,1495324800,,133,4.115384615384615
7966523,3,B00006AUI4,"This is a great cartoon series I really enjoyed watching it from start to finish, and would recommend the series to anyone.",1400630400,,123,4.636363636363637
7966524,5,B00006AUI4,"I've always liked sharks, and a while back I saw some footage of great white sharks completely clearing the water as they attacked fur seals from below.  I discovered that ""Air Jaws"" is all about that.  And, it's more than just a lot of footage of cool leaping sharks, it's about the predatory behavior and feeding ecology of white sharks off of Seal Island, South Africa.

I was greatly impressed by the work that was done mapping the bottom topography around the island, seal behavior, locations of shark attacks, and the overall picture that made.

There is LOTS of great footage of sharks - mostly in the 14-16 foot range completely clearing the water.  There is also footage of what happens when a shark misses on its initial strike and the chase that can ensue.  Great stuff!

Air Jaws II was a bit less impressive to me, though still interesting.  In this installment, the same people who did Air Jaws from South Africa traveled to Australia and the West Coast of North American to see if white sharks there would also attack like their South African kin.  The researchers use an interesting type of decoy to pull the sharks up...you'll have to watch to see what they do, but it is interesting.  It's actually kind of like mega-dry-fly fishing.  You'll see!

5 stars overall.  It's more than just cool ""Oh Wow!"" footage, you can actually learn something by watching.",1320883200,,1373,4.694560669456067

7966526,2,B00006AUI4,"As much as I enjoyed the premise of Air Jaws II, when they took the seal prop to the coast of California, I was shocked to see them lying through their teeth about great whites breaching there. Not only did they use footage from South Africa, you can clearly see that the seal is not a prop but a living seal. The female photographer claims to have gotten a shot and they show you NOTHING. Just hash over the Californian attempt! I couldn't believe the poor editing attempt.",1280880000,,474,4.3977272727272725
7966527,5,B00006AUI4,Great shots of amazing creatures these are 2 of the best shark videos out there and it's about time they are being rereleased I never got them when the first came out I was gonna wait and then boom you couldn't find them and people had to of course try to sell them at ridiculous prices well hope nobody gets suckered into buying any of the used ones because the 4 disc best of shark week set will include both Volume 1 and 2 so plus 8 others for less than most people are now charging for just the 2 videos which of course have come down in price the last month or so.,1183334400,,569,4.0
7966528,5,B00006AUI4,"[SOAPBOX] AIR JAWS is a great documentary, but is saddled with an unfortunate title. In this day and age of ENDANGERED Great Whites, it's kinda sad that in order to sell DVDs the Discovery Channel has to rely on the movie JAWS' enduring popularity. Unfortunately, JAWS does portray Great Whites as mindless hunters and eaters of humans, which is far from the truth. Perpetuating that myth by calling these beautiful creatures ""JAWS"" does nothing to advance the cause of shark conservationism.  [/SOAPBOX].

Aside from that (Which the average person won't care about, but I felt compelled to point out anyway) AIR JAWS features some of the most amazing footage of breaching Great Whites you're likely to see anywhere, and it's sister program AIR JAWS II features the same stuff, but shot right off the coast of San Francisco! Recommended for shark buffs, nature buffs, and anyone who routinely tunes in to the Discovery Channel's SHARK WEEK.  Due to occaisionally graphic kills of seals, not recommended for children five or younger.",1172361600,,1032,5.0588235294117645

7966531,5,B00006AUI4,"The incredible Great White Shark is one of the most misunderstood creatures on the planet. Most people first became familiar with this amazing animal via exposure to Peter Benchley's smash hit novel, ""JAWS"", or the blockbuster movie of the same name....and the subsequent crappy sequels.

However, after the hysteria created in the media during the mid-1970's, an enormous amount of research has gone into Great White Shark's, and only in the last few years has the tide turned. Now, many people see the Great White Shark for what it truly is...a magnificent marine predator, yet a very vulnerable and fragile creature, that plays an incredibly important role in the ocean's ecosystem. In fact, the Great White's role in the ocean's is equally important as that of the predatory big cats in the jungles of Asia and Africa.

This wonderful DVD takes the viewer to False Bay in South Africa, where marine conservationist / photographer Chris Fallows and his crew capture jaw dropping footage of 14-16 foot long Great White's ""breaching"" the water and leap through the air in pursuit of their seal prey. This deadly game of ""cat and mouse"" is startling viewing as both shark and seal exhibit leaps, twists and flips out of the water. Part 2 of the DVD showcases more remarkable footage as several Great White's feast on a deceased whale carcass...and one of the film crew clambers aboard the slippery corpse to get better shots ! ( give that man a medal for bravery or insanity ).

Fallows and his crew also journey to Australia to see if the breaching activities of South African Great White's will be replicated in Australian waters. ( Interestingly, a recently tagged Great White in South Africa swam over 10,000kms and turned up off the coast off Western Australia )

Only through the efforts of people like Chris and Monique Fallows will the Great White surivive into the future and more people will develop a greater appreciation of this unfairly maligned creature. If like myself, you are fascinated by Great White's, then this DVD is an absolute must in your collection !
