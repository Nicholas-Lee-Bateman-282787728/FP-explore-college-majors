8581565,4,B00CGCKFEG,"Don Beddoe, posing as a bank examiner, manages to steal 50 grand from teller Barry Sullivan's cage, leaving Sullivan as the chief suspect for the crime. Sullivan gets fired, as well he should for being so careless with the money trusted to him, and is hounded by insurance investigator Charles McGraw who believes that Sullivan is actually guilty. Sullivan catches a break months later recognizing Beddoe as a teller in another bank as goes the stupid route by taking matters into his own hands instead of turning everything over to the police. Barry Sullivan is solid as ever, but it's hard to like or identify with such a bonehead. Charles McGraw is excellent as always, tough and relentless and a little thick in the skull himself, stealing every scene that he's in with his attitude. Mary Beth Hughes is Beddoe's squeeze and a tough dame to boot, not hesitating when having to pull the trigger.
However, the real star of this B-Noir is the city itself. LA and vicinity in the mid 1950s, lots of fine location shooting shimmering through a stunning Warner Archive print. And unlike a lot of noirs, there's plenty of daytime scenes so it's easy to take in all of the fine location shooting, glimpses at how people lived and looked sixty years ago. I was a child in the 1950s and, though not from LA, I remember when the landscape of a major city looked like this. It's quite comforting to look back into the past and feel a sense of nostalgia, even if it's the heartless landscape of a Film Noir with fate just waiting to kick you in the behind.",1454976000,3,1547,4.588447653429603

8581568,3,B00CGCKFEG,"At the end of his Friday workday, a bank teller (Barry Sullivan) finds himself short almost 50,000 dollars. An error in judgment causes him not to report the shortage until the following Monday morning. That error in judgment makes him a prime suspect in embezzling the money and when the bonding company refuses to bond him, he is fired. Convinced he stole the money, an insurance investigator (Charles McGraw) begins stalking and harassing him. Though the plot may sound like an updating of LES MISERABLES, this ""B"" crime film is more akin to Chandler than Victor Hugo. Its story of an innocent man who finds his life turned upside down because of a lapse in judgment is strong enough to keep one engrossed though the protagonist's own stupidity renders him somewhat unsympathetic in the end. Thankfully, bank security is now sophisticated enough to prevent such an occurrence today. Its low budget B&W, shot on location look gives it a raw realism it would have lacked with a more polished studio finish. Sadly, the final 20 minutes are rather messy and deflate the tension that the film's first hour carefully built up. Directed by Harold D. Schuster. With Dorothy Malone, wasted as Sullivan's wife, but Mary Beth Hughes makes for an excellent hard as nails femme fatale and Don Haggerty, Don Beddoe, Joanne Jordan and Richard Reeves.

The Warners Archive MOD DVDr is a nice anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer.",1390003200,2,1418,4.933054393305439
