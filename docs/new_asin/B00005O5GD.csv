7948391,5,B00005O5GD,"This video is part biography and part investigation.  Jack Ruby's younger days in Chicago are discussed.  Also covered are his military stint and his post-war history in Dallas.  He is portrayed as active and volatile.  He is also shown to be caring and generous with friends.
  The people interviewed here are informative.  President Ford, Earl Ruby, Gerald Posner, former Dallas detective Jim Leavelle and Ruby's attorney all are shown.
  One of the recurring themes of this video is whether Ruby acted alone or was part of a conspiracy when he shot Oswald.  This video provides evidence for both points of view.  The evidence in this video for Ruby acting alone is more convincing than that of the conspiracy theorists.
  In 1964, Ruby told Congressman Gerald Ford that no one put him up to the shooting.  And in Ruby's final interview in 1966 he denied ever meeting or knowing Oswald.  According to brother Earl Ruby, Jack hadn't expected that his one shot would actually kill Oswald.  Ruby regretted that it did kill him.  Certainly not the words of a hired hitman.
  Ruby's 9 day trial in 1964 is covered here.  His attorneys tried insanity and seizures as a defense.  They failed.
  Mr. Ruby complained often of physical pain during his last few years.  But his pleas were largely ignored.  Cancer and a blood clot brought about his death.  Footage from his 1967 Chicago burial is shown here.
  In summary, this video succeeds in painting an accurate portrait of Jack Ruby.  It also raises serious doubts about him being part of a conspiracy.",1038268800,3,1549,4.827586206896552
