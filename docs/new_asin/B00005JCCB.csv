1429265,1,B00005JCCB,Avoid at all costs I was tortured by this thrash on a transatlantic flight. This gets a star because I can't post a review without giving it something. It is like a watered down Clueless with out jokes (any jokes).,995414400,5,214,4.375
1429266,5,B00005JCCB,"More people should have seen this movie!!!!  It's one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!!  I laughed so hard I cried!!  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Monica Potter and hilarious and the models are even funnier!!  Take me word, rent this movie and you won't regret it!!  Rent it for laughs, not a serious plotline!!",994118400,2,313,4.517857142857143
1429267,1,B00005JCCB,"I actually like Freddie Prinze a lot, and Monica Potter is the gorgeous version of Julia Roberts (which is meant as a compliment), but this movie stinks big time. Other reviewers have told the story, so there's no point on repeating it; just know that there are no jokes in the movie, at least not a good one, it all comes down to Freddie looking good and cool, Monica looking beautiful and in shock the whole movie, a bunch of sick, dull eschatological jokes (none of which appeared to have any effect on the audience), and a sad, sad portrayal of pretty women. Don't waste your time or money, it's not worth it, better wait for the release on TV",990057600,2,647,4.4
1429268,1,B00005JCCB,"Okay, Monica Potter restores paintings at this museum in New York and she swoons over paintings. Her lesbian roommate sleeps with her(not in that way) and I think have a crush on her which is why Monica has to find another place to rent.  She finds an ad for a room for only $500 (hey, i live in NYC and I find this unbelieveable) with four ditzy models as roommates. Her room is literally as small as a closet but her closet is like gigantic filled with many shoes and the models all shares clothes.  Freddie's her neighbor who works for a clothing designer or something to do with clothes. The models and MOnica crashes his party and she and him falls in love...she sleeps with him but see him (ohmygod!!!) hit a girl over the head with a bat.  She fells to the floor and then she disappears. The models calls the police but when Monica tries to describe what happened, the models kept interrupting her with nonsense. The police thinks she's crazy...But guess what?  Monica still goes out with him...hello?  if u see a guy supposedly kill a girl, would u go out with him even though it is Freddie Prinze Jr?  Yeah, if you're wacko as well...
Okay,  this movie is WEAK people.  Freddie's a good actor but he stunk in this one.  Monica (who looks like a blonde Julia Roberts) is good in Along CAme a Spider but is weak in this one.  This movie is really disgusting cuz there's two scenes with poop that I find very gross.  And the only thing I find laughable is the ditzyness of the models but its kinda hard to hear their lines cuz they say things too fast.  The whole plot is unrealistic and I don't think anyone deserves to waste their money on this.  No wonder it flopped in the box office...The commericial seemed like a good romantic comedy but it's not trust me...I recommend the Wedding Planner,  Josie and the Pussycats,  Bring it On,  Charlie's Angels if you wanna see a good comedy.  Those are really good.",989193600,3,1917,4.415954415954416
1429269,4,B00005JCCB,"how embarassing that i liked this film.  the actors are charming - the models being models aren't there for their brains, but they avoid being annoyingly stupid, monica potter (who looks like elizbeth perkins to me...) is cute, and freddie is even cuter.
the film is a silly romp - at best a date flick - but manages to make you laugh, chuckle and smile.  i found myself laughing out loud at times and was surprised.  i'd easily see it again.
ain't gonna make you leave the theater pondering deep thoughts, but you will remember a few scenes and laugh to yourself.  and, ultimately, isn't that more than enough?",988675200,5,611,4.577981651376147
1429270,5,B00005JCCB,"Freddie Prinze Jr. gives another wonderful performance. Adding to his roles in ""Down To You,"" ""Boys & Girls,"" ""She's All That,"" and the ""I Know..."" movies, Prinze takes more of an adult role in ""Head Over Heels."" Still, he gives a warm, likeable, and honest performance that young men can realte to and girls and women of all ages will melt watching. He's a good role model. He always seems to be trying to do the right thing, and whether or not that's acting or it's just the way Freddie is in real life, his endearing nature to his audience will stabilize his career and superstar status. You get the idea that he's just a really sweet, nice guy. He's going to be around for a long while. He shines in ""Head Over Heels"" with Monica Potter, who is very much a younger Julia Roberts. Monica, too, is very likeable and gives a sincere performance. They make a perfect on-screen couple--both beautiful, delightful actors whose chemistry oozed mutual respect. This is a great date movie, and I can't wait for it on DVD.",983404800,11,1016,4.557377049180328
1429271,4,B00005JCCB,"I would have never saw this movie unless my sister made me. When the movie was finally over I was very impressed. I had only seen Freddy Prinze Jr. once before in ""She's All That,"" and thought he was good. He plays as equally well here too.
 In this movie, Freddy plays Jim, a fashion executive. After an awkward meeting with a girl named Amanda (Monica Potter), they both get the hots for each other. Amanda moves in with four models in the building right next to his and has a perfect view of him. They make plans to go out, but then when she thinks she saw him murder someone, she starts her own investigation. ""Head Over Heels"" is a a great movie that you'll probably enjoy. Although the ending is not a total shocker, you'll definitley enjoy. So, why don't you get over to the theatre? Enjoy this flick.",982540800,3,808,4.3509933774834435
1429272,3,B00005JCCB,"Freddie Prinze Jr. in another Romantic Comedy?  Yes, but this one has a twist.  Monica Potter (patch adams), after moving in with 4 supermodels, discovers she has a great view of Prinze's apartment...a hunk she met a day earlier.
She likes him, blah blah blah, THEN...something very strange and twisting happens.....SHE SEES him MURDER a girl through the shade.  She then investigates this herself, and falls for Freddie along the way....did he kill someone?  Better watch this Wacky Romantic Comedy that will keep you laughing.  Although  this isn't a great movie it certainly is something fun to do with friends on a Friday night!",981849600,4,632,5.028846153846154
1429293,3,B00005JCCB,This is a pretty good movie.  Monica Potter plays a girl who ends up sharing an apartment with four supermodels.  Who are all beauty but no brains.  They all give her a makeover to be more like them. Then she meets the boy next door.  Freddie Prinze Jr.  Then while spying through the window at him thinks he kills somebody.  He also has a dog that is good for some laughs.  This is pretty much a chick flick but it's good anyway.,1493337600,,430,4.170731707317073
1429294,1,B00005JCCB,"I love this movie, that is not why I'm giving it 1 star. I'm giving it 1 star b/c what I ordered and what I received was not the same thing. I only ordered just this movie, but what I received was a 'Triple Feature' DVD including 2 other movies on it. And all the DVD's were banging around inside. It was not the same thing that I ordered and I'm very unhappy. If you'd prefer to have all 3 movies, then this is the one to buy.",1488412800,,427,3.8636363636363638

1429318,5,B00005JCCB,"Way to fun. ""Models"" who can act and have a story line that has just the right amount of screen time that fits in. A new plot on the undercover agent's mission that is simple and interesting. Monica Potter's hair and her attempt at actual painting are cheesy and almost not worth mentioning. But her acting in a light film shows she can give it a go and make it worth watching all the way to the end.",1456099200,,400,4.141025641025641

Monica Potter is great and the other girls are nice to look at it as well as funny to watch.
I really like the scene where the models are watching Monica and Freddie in his apartment fooling around, while eating pizza, drinking beer and eating ice cream.

This is a nice film to watch and enjoy for what it is... light hearted comedy...

It's an enjoyable movie that doesn't strain the brain; just sit back, look at the eye candy that is Freddie Prinze Jnr and for the boys, 5 gorgeous girls to look at throughout the whole move - what's not to like about that?! *grins*  It might not be Academy Award material, but it's a good, lighthearted romantic-comedy with a bit of intrigue and adventure thrown in.

Even my husband, who does not normally care for this genre, was laughing during some of the scenes.  Yes, there are some cheesy moments, but that is part of most 'sweet' movies charm.  I too have caught this movie on cable TV more than once, and have purchased my own copy.  If you enjoy this type of movie, I recommend ""50 First Dates"" and ""The Wedding Singer"", both with Adam Sandler.

1429439,2,B00005JCCB,"This movie is mildly entertaining, but definitely not a keeper.  Freddie Printz Jr. is very nice to look at, but he isn't a strong enough leading male actor to carry off the lead.  Monica Potter was surprisingly good as the female lead.  I didn't buy the chemistry between the two of them because it felt forced.  The supporting cast was pretty good, and they did provide some laugh out loud moments.

But Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter) doesn't mind.  All she wants is to move on with her life, forget about men (one of whom she just caught cheating on her), and throw herself into her work (restoring paintings at the Met).
Things change, however, when she meets Jim (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), the gorgeous fashion exec who lives in the next building.  Amanda and her roommates spend hours spying on him -- watching as he baby-sits, buys candy from schoolgirls, and does chin-ups -- until they decide to get Amanda closer to him by crashing a party at his place.
Amanda finally gets Jim's attention-and gets him to ask her out.  But after she returns home, she sees what looks like a murder -- one that Jim committed in his apartment.  So before going on a date with a killer, Amanda -- along with her evening-gown-clad roommates -- go undercover.
Head Over Heels is definitely high on my guilty pleasure scale.  It's a cheesy, sappy, goofy movie filled with clichs and anorexic supermodels doing undercover surveillance in heels, and I loved it.

This comedy takes place in New York, centered around the fashion industry.  Because of recent tragedies in the romantic department of her life, Amanda has given up on finding ""the perfect man"".  Her first encounters with Jim, possibly ""the one"", are hilarious.  The airhead models she rooms with add to the humor.

Lots of terrific one-liners, and many flashes of visual funniness.  Everybody--even the dog--is stereotyped, so beware if you're gay, deaf, gorgeous, smart, Aussie, Russian, ethnic.  Monica Potter is very good...where has she been until now?  Freddie Prinze, Jr. is okay, but lacks spontaneity.  Rapid plot development with lots of twists.

I've read some reviews that destroy this movie but those don't make any sense.

1429481,2,B00005JCCB,"You don't expect these sappy, young-adult romances to have really great plots, but this one was absolutely ridiculous.  For those who adore the art of chick-flick cliche, this movie is overflowing.  Our heroine, Amanda, has a history of bad taste in men (surprise), and comes home one day to find her boyfriend cheating on her (surprise again).  She moves in with a group of comic-sidekicks, er, models, and meets the man of her dreams while waiting for an elevator (didn't see that one coming, did you?)
Up until this point it's pretty normal.  Amanda spies on Jim (the dream guy), and the models are there saying funny things and doing funny things.  Then the movie gets wierd.  Amanda thinks Jim killed a woman, and the already weak plot folds under like a wet noodle.  The last half of this movie is absolutely ridiculous--a new low in comedy-romance.
So why two stars?  Well, the models ARE kind of funny sometimes.  Still, Freddy Prinze Jr. is not at all believable in his role as Jim.  I'm sure this one will find it's place in the annals of corny romance, but, if you watch it, don't expect much in the way of a story.

1429496,2,B00005JCCB,"HEAD OVER HEELS [Monica Potter, Freddie Prinz, Jr., Shalom Marlow, Ivana Milicevic, Sarah O'Hara, Tomiko Fraser / Directed by Mark S. Waters / 2001 / Universal Video & DVD / 87 minutes / PG-13]
Mark S. Waters directed one of my favorite quirky comedies, The House of Yes, a few years ago. This little independent film has been mostly overlooked and may yet be gathering dust in your favorite video store. It contained a dazzling performance by Parker Posey and a most interesting one by Freddie Prinz, Jr. Mr. Prinz also stars in Water's second movie, Head Over Heels, along with Monica Potter. It cost ten times more to make than The House of Yes, but, sadly, it delivers less than half the laughs. Mr. Waters and the attractive cast try hard, but they are working with a script so light and misdirected that they can't help but flounder ay times. The movie isn't all bad. There are several laugh out loud scenes and several good lines which are not enough to overcome a story that is all voer the map.
Monica Potter is Amanda, a bubbly girl who works as an art restorer at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Of course, since this is a movie aimed at a teen audience, Amanda's job is not even remotely similar to a real one at that prestigious institution. For example, her boss brings her some very old and famous painting because one of the faces in it is no longer clear. He simply tells her to paint in a new face. Any face, it seems. One day she comes home to find her live-in boyfriend in bed with another woman. For some reason, instead of telling him to pack up and leave, she decides she must move out. On her way to see an apartment, she is knocked down by a Doberman pincher that is being walked by Jim [Freddie Prinz, Jr.], an adorable guy Amanda instantly falls for - literally. She winds up living with four mad-as- hatters fashion models, and, conveniently, their apartment windows have an excellent view into Jim's pad. Amanda and Jim soon get cozy with each other, and all is going well until the night she thinks she sees him murdering a woman. What follows is a series of misunderstandings and sight gags. The gags make sense. The rest doesn't.
The movie tries to be too many things. It's a romance, a mystery, and a satire of models and the world of high fashion. It is also partly action-adventure. If one of these elements had been highlighted, the whole thing might have worked. Instead, it bounces back and forth, with weak results.
Considering they have little to work with, the cast is good. Freddie Prinz, Jr. is starting to mature, and in this role he vaguely reminds me of a very young Cary Grant or Rock Hudson. He might actually become real leading man material one day. Shalom Harlow, Ivana Milicevic, Sarah O'Hara and Tomiko Fraser play the models, which is easy for them because they actually are models. To me, their scenes are the movie's funniest. Perhaps if Head Over Heels had been a simple comedy about two young people trying to fall in love in the shallow, empty world of fashion, it might have worked. The subplot about Jim's maybe being a murderer never really works, and the shoot outs and car chases seem like they belong in another movie entirely.",1016064000,2,3199,4.536332179930795
1429497,3,B00005JCCB,"I first saw Monica Potter as the ice maiden in PATCH ADAMS. Too bad that just as that ice maide began to warm up, she was... (well I won't go there; no spoilers, especially of a movie I'm not reviewing). Then in HEAD OVER HEELS, Monica almost perfected her charms. If half-stars were permitted, I'd give this three and a half, mainly on the strength of her charming character, almost perfect except for one heterophobic comment, when she's considering her chances with her dream guy, she asks if he might be ""too perfect, like gay"". With movies conveying attitudes like that, it's no wonder a lot of guys would prefer their girlfriends mildly homophobic by comparison (I'm not promoting homophobia; just saying it wouldn't be surprising as a thing preferred to that attitude). Her otherwise more perfect sweetness wins the day in this movie. Her character is more charming than many another heroine in today's movies, imparting a loveliness right down to things like accidently saying ""I've got the runs"" when she meant ""I've got to run"".

One day Potter thinks she sees Prinze commit murder and now what to do about it?

It's about Amanda who falls for Jim, who may or may not be a murderer. The whole film is trying to find out if Jim is actually murderer. Monica Potter is charming and cute in the role of Amanda, and givin the right role she could be the next Julia Roberts. Freddie Prinze Jr is also very charming and likeable as Jim, but it's hard for me to believe that Jim is a hot fashion executive. Freddie still looks like he's 18. The movie goes for the laughs by having Amanda be a klutz and it has it's moments, but how many times can you laugh at her falling down the stairs. Freddies character does not fair so well with the laughs. The writers deciede to for crude and disgusting. Do we really want to hear Freddie Prinze Jr going to the bathroom, and being very, very loud about it, if you know what I mean. This has no relevance to the story except just to get a laugh. The 4 models Amanda lives with are very funny and likeable. There is a hysterical scene where the girls get stuck in a resturant bathroom, that leads them to believe Jim is gay. This scene is also very crude and disgusting, but it has a something to do with the plot of the story(kind of). The movie moves along quite nicely but the ending scene is quite rediculous and not at all what I was hoping the ending would be.

1429530,2,B00005JCCB,"Here we have a classic example of the good-natured movie that fails the Gene Siskel test - it's less interesting than a documentary of the actors having lunch and discussing the script would be.
It's Monica Potter's first attempt at comedy (unless, unlike me, you consider ""Patch Adams"" a comedy), and she does a serviceable job, word-mangling and pratfalling like a real trouper. She plays Amanda, a painting restorer at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, who lucks into an enormous Westside apartment for $500 per month. This is the first of several elements in which it is impossible to believe, but it's pretty standard stuff next to the reason given for the low rent. See, the apartment belongs to a modeling agency that lets four girls stay in it for free, and they decide to rent out a closet as a bedroom to get some extra cash. Now, I ask you; if you were a New York high fashion model, could you get by on $500 per month in spending money? Divided four ways?
Be that as it may, Amanda, who proudly announces to the women in the audience ""I know you think you have the world's worst taste in men, but you don't, I do,"" falls for the fashion executive across the street, after a classic Meet Cute featuring an amorous Great Dane named Hamlet. Get it? In case you don't, Amanda explains it for you.
The fashion exec is Jim, played by Freddie Prinze Jr. with all the personality of a loaf of white bread. Well, okay, not a loaf of white bread; we get plenty of chances to observe his muscle tone as the girls ogle him through his conveniently uncurtained windows, which are apparently opaque from the inside since he never notices that he's being spied on from fifty feet away. We don't get a chance to see his acting ability, since he's playing Cary Grant Lite.
Then Amanda sees him bash an attractive blonde's head in with a baseball bat. The cops won't listen. Amanda enlists her supermodel roommates to conduct their own investigation before her Saturday date with this presumed psycho killer. So the supermodels reluctantly endure some of the more grotesque bathroom humor of recent years, the New York subway and a variety of other Manhattan exteriors to spy on Jim. Despite their height, perfect makeup and designer outfits, no one notices them, least of all the man they're following. Hijincks ensue.
In short, this is a combination of Rear Window and North by Northwest, with a few uninspired screwball comedy reflexes thrown in. Now, in my book, good performances make up for a lot of sins, and there are several nice ones here. The supermodels hired to play the supermodels in particular acquit themselves well, especially Shalom Harlow as an opportunistic Jewish American Princess and Ivana Milicevic as a cynical Russian, along with Sarah O'Hare as a klutzy Aussie and Tomika Fraser as an intelligent African-American. Indeed, the four of them manage to outshine Potter and Prinze both, and it's a shame they weren't given a movie of their own. Or at least some of the screen time otherwise devoted to the aforementioned bathroom humor, tired romantic-thriller plot, and whining voiceovers. Or that documentary of the four of them having lunch.
I'd be interested in a movie about four good-natured models thrashing through the New York fashion world - I'd enjoy looking at them, of course, and I might learn something about fashion, too. I certainly didn't learn much about that from this movie, although the filmmakers apparently did. Their script, design and direction partake of a well-known fashion technique, that of the knockoff. Same design as a classic, in this case Alfred Hitchcock's combination of thriller and comedy elements, only made with much weaker materials.
Benshlomo says, Knockoffs are only worthwhile if they're cheaper than the real thing.",998265600,,3785,4.842592592592593
1429531,1,B00005JCCB,"I can't believe I wasted 87 minutes of my life on this garbage.  There were a few mildly funny moments, but nowhere near enough to make this pile of doggie doo redeemable.  Another Freddie Prinze playing Freddie Prinze again and some terrible performances by female ""actresses"" whose agents might want to consider shutting the garage and turning on the ignition.  Terrible and worthless film.",998006400,,392,5.09375
1429532,4,B00005JCCB,"""Head Over Heels"" is just one of those movies that you have to go into with an open mind. Just go in expecting a few good laughs and you'll like it. Monica Potter was simply gorgeus. I won't give anything away, but there is this one scene where she falls face-first while pretending to model a dress... TOO FUNNY. Worth a rental.",997833600,,329,4.32258064516129
1429533,4,B00005JCCB,"This movie is really cute and alot of funny lines.  I found the models really entertaining, especially Sarah O'Hare's character. And unlike Mila Jovovich, these girls can actually act!  Plus Monica Potter is a really really cute leading lady without being annoying and obnoxious. The bad part?  The plotline is really far-fetched.  But if you are just looking for a cute romantic comedy,  this movie delivers.  And you can check out some of Beautiful Vancouver!  (the aquarium...)",997660800,,480,5.1558441558441555
1429534,2,B00005JCCB,"They thought it was ""kinda stupid but cute""... but then they're both under 16.  I, the only adult present, thought it was ""kinda stupid"" and Trying Hard To Be Cute, which is not the same as actually being worth watching.  There were a lot of attempts to be funny, but few payoffs; it did have some amusing moments, but I could've counted on one hand the times I chuckled out loud.
The plot was silly, which is excusable; the dialogue was often ridiculous, again excusable... but most of the jokes just weren't very funny. NOT excusable.  Not in a comedy.  Did anybody else want to personally neuter that dog with a pair of garden shears?
It was a pretty tame movie as far as vulgarity.  Ok, there was some toilet humor, which is to be expected as we near the end (hopefully) of the cycle that started with ""Dumb and Dumber.""  And that nasty dog.  And frequent sexual references.  But the sex scenes themselves were of the old-fashioned cut-away variety (they fall onto the bed and the scene changes), which was a pleasant surprise.  So if you're fairly liberal-minded, you should be able to okay this for your young teens and tweens.  Mine liked it.  But it is PG-13, so if what you've read offends you, at least you're forewarned.",997401600,,1231,4.55

The next morning I decided to watch it. I was hooked in the first few minutes of it. Monica Potter did an excelent job in the lead. I see a great career for in the future. Freddie Prinze Jr.did a good job. Don't listen to all the negative attention going on around this movie because it good.

I have always been a huge Freddie Prinze, Jr. fan and looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out in the theaters...however it didn't last long because of what I believe to be a lack of interest by the ""critics""...  I finally got the chance to see it for the first time yesterday---it is amazing!  No, it is not a thought provoking movie, but who said that an entertaining movie had to be THOUGHT PROVOKING?!  Shalom Harlow, Sarah O'Hare, Monica Potter and the rest of the models did an excellent job in a very funny romantic comedy!!!

Some of the things that happened seemed so obviously easy that it could totally not happen in real life...my suspension of disbelief can only go so far... The characters weren't even realistic... This movie was a major disappointment, but I must admit that it's better than Bounce since it contained some funny scenes whereas Bounce had none....",996451200,,572,4.907216494845361
