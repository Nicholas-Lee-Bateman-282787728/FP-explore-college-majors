2425364,5,B000BMY2M4,"'Tour of Duty' is one of my favourite televisions series. It didn't last very long, but while it did, it presented a fairly realistic depiction of life in a squad of soldiers in Vietnam. Together with the series 'China Beach', it began to open doors to a difficult subject for the American public to deal with -- the American public, after all, got to see the Vietnam war almost live, day by day, year after year, in their homes on the television sets, the first war for that to happen. The controversial nature of the war and 'peace' aftermath made dealing with the subject tricky, but the writing, acting and direction in this series was superb.

The story follows an infantry company 'in-country', Company B, that is made up of a typical mixture of young, green recruits (often draftees) and a few experienced leaders, on their one-year tour of duty in Vietnam; the series began (and this video begins) in 1967, one of the early hot years of the conflict. The base is a typical firecamp, nicknamed Ladybird, with bunkers, sandbags, jungle surroundings, and lots of mud.

Stars of the series include many second-tier Hollywood film and television actors, who are all much better actors than their stature might indicate. Key figures included experienced and battle-hardened Sgt. Zeke Anderson (portrayed by Terence Knox, who has been star or guest star on dozens of television series) and relatively-new officer Lt. Myron Goldman (Stephen Caffrey, soap opera star also noted for some quality film work), as they work together to guide a group of men through the literal and metaphorical minefields of the Vietnam war. Other actors include Eric Bruskotter, Joshua Maurer, Kevin Conroy, Stan Foster, and Tony Becker.

In the pilot to the series, the men have a mission to destroy a hidden NVA base headquarters. It depicts the struggles and stress of jungle combat, and portrays the relationships built under fire by the men who come to depend upon each other for their lives.

The soundtrack takes a similar device from other Vietnam-era shows and films, that of using music contemporary with the conflict. 'Paint It Black' is the opening theme, an ironic and appropriate song and lyric. Beware, however, if you get it on DVD, that this soundtrack has been altered, including the very riveting opening.

This is a superb piece on a troubled time in American history. The series lasted for three years (but the seasons didn't all have full complements of 23-26 episodes each), from 1987 - 1990, for a total of 58 episodes in all.",1131408000,53,2529,4.8857808857808855

2425420,2,B000BMY2M4,"The quality of the video that I received was very sub par and when the video is moving it is very shaky and jerky.  I purchased the entire box set so I can get disc #5 of season one due to it being misplaced and unable to find.  The color and the sharpness of the video is circa 1987.  If you want the highest quality of the series Tour of Duty make sure you purchase the Sony Video version and not the Millcreek Studios version.  Tour of Duty is the best series that has been on TV, but make sure you purchase the higher quality version, not this version.  I am even watching it on an SDTV like they had back in the period that this series was running.  DVD holders are cheaper, not like the Sony's hard plastic version.",1520035200,,721,4.114285714285714

2425423,3,B000BMY2M4,"If this release had the original soundtrack, I would have given it five stars without hesitation.  But, it has a cheesy generic 80s soundtrack instead.  And to make matters worse, the awful music was mixed in poorly, so it frequently drowns out the dialogue when it's playing.  However, the acting in this show is great.  The plots are riveting, and you really get a feel for what an infantry soldier in Vietnam endured.

2425438,3,B000BMY2M4,"Tour of duty was a great show especially as a kid who grew up in the 1980's. I learned from watching this show what the Vietnam War was about and the lives of the soldiers who were there. I would have given it a higher rating if the original music like ""Paint it Black"" and other great songs from that era were included but no they had to modify it and take out the original song soundtrack. I wonder if they will make a reboot of Tour of duty ?",1517616000,,445,3.9555555555555557

2425481,3,B000BMY2M4,"Decent show, but the Mill Creek collection yo save money but sacrifice video quality and other things, like the original music, but hey, no problem, I bought this set for about $13 on sale even though I own a region 2 complete set with original music, cause I wanted to have a copy to work in regular dvd/blue ray players if my multi region player broke down and couldn't afford a new one.  Problem is, the video quality is choppy in many places, from extreme compression, and seems to have been taken off older video tape so has very poor resolution in various areas, OR they have 16 mm copy from a copy from a copy from a copy etc etc.  Most likely this came from a major tv network file archive, used for years and years of re runs.  BUT, for twenty dollars and under, it is representative enough for those who would like to watch the show and make a decision to later get premium copy,....maybe there is one in region 1 USA , unsure.  I remember on the premium set, they had extras that talked of the making of the show, and how sesason 2 and season 3 came about,.......needless to say, season 1 is most worth watching, cause the scum hollywood socialist democrats even back then decided to ruin the show starting season 2 cause ""China Beach"" the anti war soap opera concerning vietnam was being pushed hard to show america how bad we all are compared to communists.  So, in season 2, the usual commie lgbt hollywood made the african american characters as former street thug drug dealing, stealing, car thieving street urchins always hustling to make an ill gotten buck, several female strong characters such as the doctor who is a liberal anti war psychiatrist who needs to evaluate everyone especially if they killed the commie enemy, and the anti war female reporter but not strong enough that they weren't sexually hooked up with the leading men, the sarge and the LT.  The latino peurto rican becomes a mentally weak superstitious nutcase instead of a strong Bronx origin latino, and of course this show was made about the time hollywood democrat elites and the democrat party declare total war on all military veterans I guess cause they wanted and still want a society run by them like royalty, .....so all the strong military figures are portraying mental weakness and instability apart from several or more instances of guess actors going totally insane and shooting up their own people,.....UUUUUUUVVVVVVVVVV course which is of course the usual democrat royal party elite propaganda, and ya know, the story lines are generally the same thirty years later!,..  The acting sucked in season 2 and 3 like they were forced to act like they could not act, and season 3 was a total sham, but from the 80's forward such movies as casualties of liberalism,  errrrrr, I mean casualties of war, even rambo, first blood, int he end he was supposed to commit suicide but stallone refused to dirty his reputation playing a homicidal---suicidal maniac, over thirty years ago.  BTW, season one was shot in Hawaii in various nice locations,.....season two and three they dropped that to film in the same hundred or so feet of California stream bed nearer the studios so as to spend barely any money and ruin the show on purpose, which is why season 1 was so good additionally, but what do you expect from folks who pushed M.A.S.H. 4077 anti war tv for eleven years!(Loretta Swit, Michael Farrel, and a couple others still can't shut their mouthes enough concerning Trump or republicans with any power at all voted in by regular people).",1499472000,,3534,4.696284329563813

Near the end of season three, a lieutenant responsible for a village massacre says to a court martial that he was just following Republican president Nixon's anti-communist agenda, da da da..  Actually, when said massacre (revealed in same episode) occurred, September of 1968, the anti-communist Democrat president Johnson was still in charge.  My but things sure have changed.

2425514,3,B000BMY2M4,I am a Vietnam Vet and I don't think the producers of this show had adequate consults or veterans input.  This series took place in 1967 and I didn't get to Nam until 1970.  There are some discrepancies that a lay person wouldn't notice. For instance: no GI would run into the jungle by himself to chase an enemy; sitting in groups in the jungle (one grenade would get them all); men too close waking in the jungle; no helicopter insignia or medivac cross; when out of ammo men didn't pick up enemy weapons.  The three most disturbing items for me were: the lack of quality acting and the character lines; the soundtrack was more like Miami Vice right out of the 80s rather than the period; and there were no English subtitles when needed. For me this series was just okay.,1490918400,,773,4.429577464788732

2425535,4,B000BMY2M4,"The only reason to buy this for the ""pilot"" episode and ""year one"". Filmed in lush Hawaii, it has the tropical look of ""Nam"". The writing and acting are excellent per season one. It's about American soldiers trying to conduct and survive one of our nation's most difficult and controversial wars. It gets very realistic at times. Then, with the coming of ""season two"" the series gets shot to hell (no pun intended). It's now being filmed between the arid California coastal ranges near Los Angeles. That makes it look all so fake along with its new ""fire base"". The Women's Movement of the 1980s, when the series was filmed, intrude into the writing and the cast of the show. It fast becomes a soap opera filled with new regular cast members, female of course, with their own agendas and manipulations to secure influence in their careers and to mold soldiers into the types of relationships they want. Combat sequences become fewer and far between. Anything tropical-looking is an obvious stage set and not convincing at all. Can you say, ""poorly placed potted tropical plants and dead bamboo""? Season three is even worse. The show got cancelled. Season One is what it's all about. That's only 4 discs out of the 11 disc set. The disks,by the way, come in big a stack. Not a lot of care seems to have gone into the packaging. This gets 4 stars only because Season One is part of the deal and the first season rocked! Otherwise, I would not give it any stars at all.

2425551,1,B000BMY2M4,Tour of Duty was an excellent series. BUT the DVDs lost their original music soundtrack and the replacement music doesn't fit the action nor is it any good. I read reviews here before buying the set. So I rented the first disc to see if the music track was as bad as reviewers were saying. It s worse. The music soundtrack is about twice the volume as the movie soundtrack and in some places drowns out the dialog. If you turn the volume down so the music track is at an acceptable level the voice dialog is too quiet to hear. Turn the volume up high enough for the voices and you will drive everyone not watching the show out of the house. There is no way to adjust the sound on the disc.

Ire ember watching this series on TV for one reason: it told a pretty realistic story about the issues our men and women faced in war.  I bought this for that reason and enjoyed it.  Acting is good for the main characters and so so for supporting ones.  Storylines are good.  No CGI effects here.,1473552000,2,380,4.222222222222222

Excellent box with which I believe all episodes on it. Am halfway into the first season now. Great show and exactly how I remember it.
The only thing I guess I never noticed, but do now, is some of the horrible dated 80's synthesizer score sounds, which sometimes are so overly loud, you can't even hear the dialogue through it. Either I never noticed it watching the original series or its something they added to the DVD release. Not sure, but it gets annoying sometimes. Other then that a great DVD set of an underappreciated TV show.",1469491200,5,663,4.487603305785124

hollywierd so you have to expect that. As fiction, they're okay; as reality, not so much. Still, I'll watch all of them eventually. Good to watch while

Of Course Mill Creek doesn't disclose this minor detail anywhere on the packaging, a little underhanded.  Next time I buy, I'll be steering clear of anything done by Mill Creek. I remember watching this series back when it was new, a lot of the music really underscored what was going on in the story line.",1449964800,,451,4.6375
2425872,4,B000BMY2M4,"First of all, full disclosure, I don't own this set, but I own the original single season releases, so other than that I assume this release is pretty much the same disk pressing, but anyway...

Second, I have a question for those who complain about the lack of CC (Closed Captioning) and the lack of original music queues.  Huh?  So you can't hear the dialogue, but you can hear the music?  Does your volume control not work?  Try a dedicated surround sound system with better speakers than the small 10W speakers on TV.

Third, the series itself.  I remember watching this during its original run from, 1987-1989.  And was eager to watch it again on DVD in the early 2000s.  The first season was probably the best, as it had the entire cast before several were wittled out due to combat deaths, and because it was filmed in Hawaii that easily doubles for SE Asia.  However they moved the series to Southern California for the final two seasons using a film set that is easily recognizable to many TV buffs which took away some of the believability.  I don't remember much about the series since I haven't watched it in about 10 years, but it was a decent enough depiction of small unit tactics and life in Vietnam.  My biggest problem with the DVD presentation is that it is non-anamorphic full screen 480i which looks like ass on an HDTV.  A show like this just screams for an HD remaster, but I doubt it'll ever happen.",1449532800,,1423,4.51171875

I loved this show when it was on TV, but a large part of what made it so good was the period music used as the soundtrack. I was most distressed to find that 99% of the original music has been replaced with modern studio crap that ""simulates"" 1960's music. I ended up giving away all my DVDs to a friend's dad who is a former Marine, out of work, and he watched them all day long. I found a source on the internet which has DVDs, video quality is not quite as good, but it has all the original music and even the trailers for the next week's episodes. What they lack in video quality (not that much) is made up for by having all the original music present.

That said, they have laid in decent generic substitute tracks that provide the atmosphere of the original music.  However, in some places, the music is too loud and obscures the dialog.

2425987,4,B000BMY2M4,"As a namvet, I had never watched this show. In these twilight years, I have heard mixed reviews from other vets. A lot was positive with caution.
It does portray (still in 1st season)  a lot of actual experiences in an over -the-top manner. And the confusion of the pilot episode when SSG goes to HQ to recruit??? The HQ of 23rd INF DIV.???? The patches they wear are 176th Light Inf BDE attached to AMERICAL, and I can not find a 23rd Division in Vietnam research. Episodes seem to be patterned on COMBAT! series dealing with small unit tactics of WWII.
Anyway it seems the purpose was to encapsulate every possible actual and social discord of the entire COMBAT portion of Vietnam. The year 1967 is TOUR OF DUTY,yet incorporates later years,TET OFFENSIVE on and REMF problems as Grunt experiences earlier than occurred. Told season three is most lame. But it is due to such flaws a vet can watch it without major PTSD happening. When it looks unrealistic and even funny, it is hard to induce the fugue state while laughing, or as the actor playing at the bridge blowing ""Green Beret"" movie episode,""Are you for real,Man! response to questionable scenes.",1439769600,3,1155,4.689655172413793

I realize that the style of television drama was different when this series aired, but I seriously could not get past the preachy and cheezily expository dialogue.  The direction isn't very good, either, and the scripts are loaded with stock war-movie situations:  the pacifist who needs to get on board and help his fellow soldiers, etc.  I wanted to like this series, but it's complete amateur hour here.

It had great character development and dealt with many issues that were taboo to talk about even in the 80s. Terrence Knox as my favorite character ""Zeek"" Anderson is my favorite TV character from the 80s-early 90s. Stephen Caffrey also turned in a great performance as Lt Goldman. Inevitably characters were killed off or exited the war and, during the 3rd season, they even showed what some of them faced back home. Season 1 is the best! BUYER BEWARE!!! One thing any potential buyer MUST know before buying this - Every fan of the series will tell you how great the show is in inserting relevant songs from the 60's rock culture. Unfortunately, the releases on DVD have been modified with session music instead of the great songs such as Paint it Black, Turn turn turn, Bad moon rising etc. Each episode has 2-4 songs. It appears this release does not have the original soundtrack or it would have mentioned it. I recently bought the series which included the original soundtrack. Look for that before you buy. I had to get mine from Australia with region settings for that country. Small price to pay to get the show as it originally aired.",1425340800,94,1272,4.683035714285714
2426176,5,B000BMY2M4,"Tour of Duty was my absolute favourite television series as a child. It was not immediately released in Australia and aired locally from about 1988 to 1991, but the timing was perfect for me and my friends as we became consumed by the show and we liked to believe some of the attributes of numerous key characters were in us.

Admiring his heroics we all claimed to be a bit like Zeke Anderson (Terence Knox), yet I saw myself more like Danny Percell (Tony Becker) as he was for the most part a reliable soldier with some compassion.

Despite close to 30-years passing since the first release of the series it has aged reasonably well and still dazzles somewhat with decent action scenes.

As an adult I have a much greater appreciation of the themes conveyed within the episodes as notable effort was made to portray popular and unpopular facets of the war. Also, considering it was made for television it worked surprisingly well within its limitations of an episodes format and budget restrictions.

I didn't have the opportunity to watch every episode when the program aired in Australia, but the box set has allowed me to see it all and numerous wonderful bonus features. It's not often in life we can be taken back to a different time (1988 to 1991) in our lives so vividly, and the soundtrack of the show was my first introduction to classic hits from the time period of the narrative.

It's a shame the show only aired for three seasons but I'm sure I'm not the only person it made a lasting impression on. Buy the complete series and experience it all!

The only negative comment I can make is that I wish the DVD set version of the show that I purchased had the Rolling Stone song Paint it Black playing at the start of every episode like the television version does because that song was popular during the late 1960s when the series is set and it appropriately sums up the situation that Myron and his platoon are in while they are serving in Vietnam.

2426270,1,B000BMY2M4,"I see other people have commented on having the set w/out the original music. I returned mine when I played the first one. I don't know about others, but I wanted this series because I was there and that music was our music and that music and the war were tied together. So if you want to see an excellent series but w/o the authentic music, then go for it. For me it's like seeing Apocalypse Now with cover songs ... Robert Duval playing Beethoven instead of Wagner????

[Let me say that some of you may have also looked for dvds of the most popular series of that time China Beach whcid ran from 1988-1991. The series is ""not available,"" tho you may surf the internet and find maybe ahem something. At any rate, the dvd advertised here of CB is the first episode only. The cd of the music is totally different. It's like going to see one of those Beatle bands -- just doesn't cut it. In fact, if I remember right, one of the cuts is Lennon singing Imagine! There is another cut with Dana Delaney singing something. (also not from the series)]

If I were you, I'd go online and search for the original Tour of Duty series. (Remember the dvds have been transferred from VHS.) I'd go the Canadian route rather than the Chinese, if you know what I mean. But having Tour of Duty with the original music is the way to go if you're a boomer. If you just want to see a good series, two years? about the war with good acting, then ToD should suffice.
A word about music rights. Much of the music of this period is now in the public domain. I read somewhere that producers were not releasing dvds of some Vietnam programs because the public did not want to see them and had low viewer numbers. They got rave reviews from the critics, however.
It's not the music rights that prevented them from releasing the series -- most of them -- I think they just don't think enough people would buy them. IMO",1323648000,6,1889,4.303370786516854

I couldn't stop watching it...and my boyfriend (who had never seen the series before) was addicted as well. We spent every weekend watching one episode after another until we had watched all three seasons. Terence Knox was unforgettable as Sergeant Anderson and our favorite character.

What's up?  They didn't want to pay royalties or what?  If I can find a ""pirated"" copy that had the music in it I would and I am a believer in buying ""original"" so the actors get their fair share. If I was the actor I would be screaming fowl play.  I will not buy the #2 and #3 of the series for this reason only.  I loved this series. Sony or who ever needs to get this straighten out and quick.

I wasn't able to complete the series because there was blackouts at the time (Manila had some problems with electricity supply) and the airing was every Monday (a school night) at 21:00.

All the great action and stories are there, and it is fun to watch a young Kim Delaney (NYPD Blue) and a real Kevin Conroy (the voice of Batman in animated movies and TV shows).  But it gets real weird when the actor references a well-known song by title and artist and you hear some muzak simulation that has nothing to do with it.  They must think we're stupid!!!  I heard the same music as background for cheezy local TV commercials!  Anyway, if you're looking for a rare blast from the 80's TV past, this is a worthy nugget.

To those that have seen the show before and paid attention to the music (perhaps more than the show itself?) I can only state, then this set is not for you.

I had not ever heard of this show.  I came across the listing as I was looking for something else (I guess Amazon's ideas do work).  I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try sometime.  I decided to buy the whole series even though I could have purchased the individual sets for less (the sets and the series were both on sale; the series cost $10 more than the individual sets combined).  I would suggest if this happens again, NOT to buy the series box.  It is constructed of cheap cardboard and the 3 sets are merely placed inside.  Only worth it is the series cost is less than the sum of the individual sets.

There is an episode in the first season where the actors come into screen talking about Marvin Gaye and begin mouthing the words to whatever song originally played.  Not only was the replacement music not Marvin, it was instrumental.  The guy dancing around in the background ""singing"" to nothing was a little distracting, but this was the only time I noticed.

Tour of Duty is a poignant and sometimes disturbing look at what occurred during the Vietnam War.  Each episode in seasons 1 and 3 have a tidbit of information about Vietnam, and the episode often touched on that information and in a very real way.  I was a little kid in the 60's and was sheltered from this war.  I've learned more from this series than from school and recommend it to anyone that has not seen it before.

You see the new recruits starting out from the beginning of there tours of duty to the end after the 3rd season, these soldiers start out green, gung ho etc...you see them go through many transformations, from drugs, AWOL, scared, mistakes, depression, anger, the stories are very good, reflecting upon the times of the late 60's.
By the third season, they are veterans and when they get new soldiers into the squad, they either help them or keep them away at arms length, not wanting to know them because, most likely, these new soldiers will die in there first couple of missions.
In the second season, some female characters were added, and it turned out to be a great addition to the cast, the stories were great, they added something to the main characters in the show, like the lieutenant and the especially the sergeant, who we get to see with his daughter.

2426458,3,B000BMY2M4,"While I agree that ToD was one of television's better attempts at depicting Vietnam, it is terribly unfortunate that music egos prohibited the use of the original soundtrack that aired on with the series. Most notably absent is the opening theme ""Paint It Black"" by the Rolling Stones. While it is most certainly true that there is more to any series or film than its soundtrack, it is equally true that the soundtrack combines with the video to create the finished product. The loss of the original music then is a loss of the part of the actual art as it was originally displayed. It is sad that performers couldn't simply be happy with having their work live on as part of a greater whole. But then for many it isn't so much about art as it is about the money. I know some people think this is nit-picking but the fact is that this in not the ""original"" series as it was originally broadcast and is not as good as the original.  Two of the primary things that characterise the 1960's in America were the music and the Vietnam War. The true original of ToD was a masterpiece of television for it's time and limitations. These new versions are not as good. The new music in most instances, though not all, is awful and actually distracts from the film.

Lastly, it is grossly unfair for a studio to release any series with a modified soundtrack, particularly one where in which the soundtrack was such an integral part of the show, without making plain to the purchaser that they are not buying a copy of the show as it was originally broadcast, but a modified version of it.",1214006400,36,1576,4.46875

Tour of a Duty is a Vietnam TV show, describing the daily life during that period; dealing with all the human day to day issues, the war factors and the good conclusions of each episode.

I have never seen this TV show before, so what I read in other reviews about the bad music in that DVD box verses what the music was at the time when the show was aired did not bother me a bit. I even liked the new music.

The show had another good aspect; I was able to watch it with my 13 year old son and enjoy every episode. As far as my son was concerned it had lot of war action which was great for him and as far as I was concerned I felt that my son learned a lot watching this show and learning about with the day to day problems war creates; ethics, dignity and loyalty above all.

The quality of the DVD is not great however very acceptable.

2426509,4,B000BMY2M4,"Brought back some great memories of an excellent series!  It has still not dated and is great to watch again.

One HUGE disappointment was the lack of the original soundtrack.  The sound was one of the main reasons for the purchase. I only realised the original soundtrack was not on the DVD collection while reading reviews after I had ordered!!

While the sound was a big disappointment, I am still glad I purchased the set.",1168905600,2,426,4.64
2426510,5,B000BMY2M4,"I had seen a few episodes of this series when it first was on television and thought it was well acted and very true to life.  I served a tour in the same AO in the same time period that this takes place. (I'm afraid there are no mountains there, other than Nui Ba Den on the Cambodian border).

The characters are believable, are developed as characters throughout the series, and you come to know them and care about them (unlike the characters in ""Band of Brothers"").  Two minor quibbles: 1.) Some one with Infantry experience should have coached the character ""Ruiz"" on how an M-60 is fired.  If you fire an M-60 like he does you'll: a) hit very little, and b) burn out the barrel. 2.) The producers felt compelled to introduce round-eyed love interests for the main characters as the series went into the second and third seasons.  Enlisted men and junior officers in combat units lived in a world devoid of Caucasian women (unless they spent time in an Evac hospital).

In spite of these quibbles, a terrific series and a bargain for 99, 40-minute stories.  The interplay between the young lieutenant and his 3-tour platoon sergeant alone is worth the purchase price.

On viewing the series  again, I would add the following.  The first season used a nice convention of beginning each episode with a black screen with white letters giving some factoid about the Vietnam War which would be central to that episode.  The second season moved the unit from Chu Lai down to Tan Son Nhut airbase in Saigon, which allowed the episodes to be broader than just missions in the bush.  It also introduced love interests for both Lt Goldman and SGT Anderson and the series began to address issues like racial tension and drug use.  The third season unfortunately decided it needed star power, introducing Carl Weathers as a SOG Col, and Lee Majors as an aging enlisted man.  They did okay, but star power wasn't needed and was a bit of a distraction.  The seasons ends with some of the platoon members going home and the difficulties they encounter reintegrating with civilized society.

If you liked this series, consider buying the DVD of the HBO series of short stories entitled ""Vietnam War Story"".  Good writing, good acting, realistic depiction of Vietnam as experienced by the GI, and no howkie love interests.  Also consider ""Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam"".",1168300800,4,2369,4.750611246943765
2426511,3,B000BMY2M4,"Many people love this series, I know, or tend to remember it fondly if they haven't seen it recently, I too liked it , watched it each week in the 80s, but a friend about 10 yrs older than i, who was an Australian  Vietnam  vet, openly ridiculed it from the start, to an extent you couldn't watch it with him, he wouldn't shut up mocking it, his right, of course, having been there, in country in 'Nam, he was wounded by an RPG and fought one Cong who appeared had a machete bent on dealing with the wounded, Rick ended up shanking the  the guy with a small knife that is in the First Aid kit for cutting bandages dressing wounds, ended up inflicting some wounds with it instead.

I saw a post on the China Beach thread referring to both shows as 'great shows' of Vietnam war period,
 China Beach probably is,
TOD, not really, imo.

About a year ago, it started to run in syndication on Tv in Australia, late nights, I saw 2 episodes, one was the pilot, I think, one was about Tunnels and 'tunnel-rats' unit, Terence Knox goes down into a tunnel with another soldier, maybe one of the black GIs, when one of the special Tunnel rats is ejected KIA by the VC in the tunnel.

I have to say this, the show has its strong-points, most of this is concerned with exploring issues and themes.

It harkens to the old 1960s Vic Morrow series ""Combat"", set nowhere in particular in France in months after d-day invasion, a small squad of GIs, much like the Bravos in TOD, wander about the countryside encountering the odd nest of angry German infantry, who are usually considerate enough to break cover run straight out in front of them firing Schmeissers, only to be promptly KIAd (without blood or flesh-mess)  by Saunders Thompson, Little John and Cages Garands , or Kirbys BAR.  Combat also often, if not always, explored war and combat issues, of various kinds, some episodes were better than others. Two of the best concerned the Sergeant is taken prisoner by the 'krauts', in amongst the other GI POWs is a German plant, played by Claude Akins. Another great one was the one with a village priest who was also a german Agent:there was also a 2-part Hamburger Hill style story of attempting to take a hill dogedly held by Germans. Only to finally take it, at heavy cost, in time to be ordered to abandon it, by High command.

Tour of Duty, to me, is Combat with longer grass  and Asian ""Krauts"" and civilians.
In both shows, the combat scenes are rarely realistic or even credible. Sometimes in both shows, they verged into the ridiculous.
Both units repeatedly walked unwittingly into German/VC/NVA perfect ambushes killing zones, only to escape being wiped out due to a crazy last-minute bungle by the enemy troops, such as a nervous VC pulling back his AK47 rifle-bolt at the last moments, making a loud click ,  alerting the GIs.. who hear it, go to ground for a few seconds, then continue on regardless, but still somehow escape mandatory annihilation. Even when a nervous enemy soldier doesnt blow the ambush, despite the MG42 or whatever MGs the Cong had opening up at 20 yards range on a tightly bunched group of our heroes, they rarely achieve any more execution that 1 or 2 WIAs. Usually ""expendables', like in Star Trek, not guys we recognize who are far too important to be successfuly greased  by Charlie.
Although I think Bravos' quiet Japanese Nisei guy is KIA eventually.

Somewhat ironically, the only guy dear to them Bravo  ever lost,  in an Asian war,  was an Asian-American.

Both shows had a charismatic platoon sergeants, although Terence Knoxs Sergeant has a little more personality with his headband,  southern accent and wry humour, than Vic Morrow's sullen but memorable .45 Thompson-carrying sgt Saunders.

TOD has an additional strength that Combat lacked, the great 60s soundtrack, but I have heard the DVD sets lack the original sound-tracks for legal reasons. Combat just had the same trudging, but again memorable,  set of ""Combat""  theme and scores..and the odd ripple of a French accordion.

to sum up, TOD has something to say, but it has dated , not that well, the battle scenes do not match todays standard such as Private Ryan or Flags of our Fathers,they are often farcical, with 'Ruiz' standing out in the open banging away from the hip with an M60,  the strength of both shows is exploring some war issues, with acting which is adequate to fairly  good in both shows,  with TOD scoring  additional points with music soundtrack and capturing with some success, the atmosphere of the period.

If you want to know what battle was like in Vietnam, no, it takes you nowhere with that, no realism whatsover, but if you want to see what were some genuine features and issues of Nam explored with some fact and entertainment value, and enjoy 60s music and atmosphere, yes, its a buy.",1167350400,2,4812,4.634864546525324

The only difference between when i watched this in high school and now, is that now I'm a Sergeant First Class in the Regular Army, and a combat arms soldier.

2426545,5,B000BMY2M4,"First off let me clarify that I own the entire series but not in this format.  I own the individual seasons instead.  With that being said I must also say that I love this show.  I was probably about 12 or so when I first discovered the show and was hooked.  When the DVD's came out I loved being able to go back and enjoy them again.  Before the DVD's I had to set my VCR in college to FX for mid-day reruns.

Tour of Duty was probably one of the grittiest war dramas ever to appear on TV.  It tackled virtually every issue with regards to the Vietnam War.  Everything from the Tunnels of Cu Chi to Heroin, to protests, drug trade and black market, battle fatigue, prostitution, and more.  This is pretty impressive condsidering the show was produced in the late 80's and most programming was not quite that edgy yet.  Still I applaud the makers of ToD for this.  The show is not only entertaining it is also educational.

A couple gripes do exist about the show in general.  One the acting was pretty poor.  I think those who truly loved the show were very much into Vietnam era combat movies, etc... however any casual fan would probably classify the acting as lousy.  nunez is probably the most consistent and compelling character throughout the show.  There are other decent performances but overall most characters are not up to par with more modern day quality shows.

Also along with the acting the budgetary constraints on the show kept the action to a minimum and fairly bland.  There is certainly is a ton of action and combat sequences in each episode don't get me wrong, just it isn't all that realistic.  However it gets the job done in providing entertainment and progressing the story.  Just if you compare it to say Hamburger Hill or Full Metal Jacket the sequences are way too unrealistic.

My final gripe is with the studio and why the show was ended so abruptly.  I assume the show was cancelled and this drives me nuts because essentially the show never ends.  You can tell by the last episode the show was gearing up for a finale but it never comes!  In fact the Lieutenant barely even appears in the final episode and he was one of the biggest characters.  Most likely the show was ending and the networks just pulled the plug on it before they ever finished it off.  Just would have been nice to finally see what happened to Danny, Sarge, Leu, and the others the way the show was clearly meant to end.

All in all the show is great.  One of my all time favorites ever aired.  The poor acting and sometimes unrealistic action can easily be over-looked because of the great messages each episode was delivering.  I was born after the Vietnam War and still understand the importance it has had on our lives.  This show aimed to make that war a reality and it succeeded.  Don't worry too much about the soundtrack as everyone else is complaining about.  I don't know why this would take the show completely down from a 4-5 star rating to a 2.  If you wanna hear songs from the 60's and 70's then buy some old CD's.  Sure I remember the music being great in the show but whatever.  The show is still there.  I understand that the generic free liscense music they replaced it with is rather boring and doesn't help the mood of the show all that much it certainly doesn't make the show any less watchable.  Also the music issue makes Tour of Duty fall into that category of ""cliche"" Vietnam movie.  You know the type.  Virtually every Vietnam movie I have ever seen has had ""We Have to Get out of this Place"" by the Animals somewhere in it.  And I have seen just about every Vietnam movie ever made.

Do yourself a favor.  If you love Vietnam War themed movies or material then you must buy this show.  It is one of the best war dramas ever produced and even with a few hiccups it still reigns as one of the most educational and entertaining shows you will ever see!",1143763200,20,3883,4.40084388185654

2426550,3,B000BMY2M4,"I rented the first season because I heard the soundtrack was missing and wanted to be sure I could still enjoy it before buying it for good. There isn't anyway I could buy this set.

I loved the show when it was originally on but without the soundtrack it isn't the same. Someone said that if they wanted to hear the music they would just play the theme song of ""Paint It Black"" and other 70's songs off their CD player. That was the dumbest thing anyone could suggest. That would be like Star Wars not including the soundtrack on their DVD and then someone suggesting that you could just play the CD soundtrack while watching the movie.

The original music helped set the background and feeling for the show. The music they have now just doesn't do it for me. It's a shame because this is one DVD set I would love to own.",1137196800,159,822,4.296774193548387
2426551,5,B000BMY2M4,"This was sadly too short lived a series, with superb actors great story lines and important messages, the truth of the Vietnam war should never be forgotten nor should those who gave their lives there.  This is a strong compelling piece of TV that gets better every time you watch it, you are drawn into the main characters due to great writing and superb acting I do not know of anyone who has watched this series who has not been bitten by the TOD bug!  It has everything a good show needs and with such actors as Terence Knox it is also a females must see.  This is a show I will never tire of watching.",1136419200,3,606,4.206896551724138
2426552,4,B000BMY2M4,"This is a fantastic show and box set and is highly recommended to anyone who liked the series in the 80s. Acting and production values aren't perfect but it has stood the test of time reasonably well and is slightly better than the average B grade war film/series.

However, there is one glaring problem with it which has been touched on by another reviewer, and that is all the original soundtrack music from the period has been stripped from the show, including the legendary ""Paint it Black"" by the Stones which played at the beginning of each show. Other than that, its a good boxed set.",1135814400,24,591,4.5754716981132075
2426553,4,B000BMY2M4,"The earlier programs were far better than the later when a reporter and in-country girlfriends were involved.  However, the major loss is that when the series was released for sydication on TNT and now on the DVD the original music of the period was stripped from the soundtrack and generic themes inserted.",1134864000,104,307,4.903846153846154

8089141,2,B000BMY2M4,I haven't even received my copy yet and I'm disappointed. My dad watched this regularly when I was young and to this day Paint it Black is synonymous with Tor of Duty for me. Recently something reminded me of the series so I looked it up and was so excited to see it here I ordered it immediately. Now it's in town and about to be delivered tomorrow and I read the reviews to find out that the main thing I remember is removed....,1524441600,,430,4.130952380952381

8089147,1,B000BMY2M4,"I bought the first season for my brother as a gift, then quickly realized I needed another set for my husband. I ended up purchasing the complete series for us thinking that would make up for not getting him a copy in the first place. And maybe that would have worked, except... ""Where's the music?!?""
In a world of instant searches via smartphone, we discovered the original music was removed from the DVDs!!!!
NOT COOL!!!!
