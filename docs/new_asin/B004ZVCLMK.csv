Oh by the way, the programme is great. 4 90 minute segments on 2 discs. Some people look for more discs, but to find the second program on each disc you have to go to the menu. They do not play through. More than one person has missed programs 2 and 4.",1436832000,,516,4.099009900990099
8450455,5,B004ZVCLMK,"A distinctly unflattering portrait of the birth of the Israeli state, and its present-day consequences.  But thoroughly gripping drama!  No one comes out of this looking good except the Palestinian Arabs.",1393200000,6,204,5.548387096774194
8450456,5,B004ZVCLMK,"I searched Amazon for this video because I recently watched it on Hulu Plus. I am
so disappointed the DVDs cannot be played on an America DVD player.

Nonetheless, this mini series had me captured from the start.  I wasn't sure what
to expect, but it opened my eyes to the conflict in the Middle East. I had no idea
the British had been a part of this when the Jews were liberated from the concentration
camps in Europe.  I really enjoyed the double story taking place in the same locale
two generations apart.  I found it difficult to watch at times, but this is history.
I would like to see it again, and was hoping to purchase a copy for my own library,
but it doesn't appear to be available for the US DVD players.  I recommend this
mini series to everyone.  I thought the acting was very good. I wasn't familiar
with any of the actors, but I think that made it more real.",1358121600,12,876,4.246987951807229
8450457,5,B004ZVCLMK,"A mini-series about the British in Palestine. Two stories told simultaneously, they're based on actual events (even though the likelihood of the characters being involved in all these events is improbable) and it's quite moving. The Promise has educational value too, since Israel/Palestine is not a subject that was sufficiently covered in my curriculum at school, even though it's still one of the most debated themes in International Relations. I strongly recommend watching it; we couldn't stop and spent a whole Sunday from start to finish.",1335139200,9,545,5.348837209302325
