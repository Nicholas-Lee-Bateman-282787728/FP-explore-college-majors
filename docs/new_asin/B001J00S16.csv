3650371,5,B001J00S16,"If you've seen The Secret and What the Bleep?, this is the next natural step to achieving what you want in life. While The Secret gives you the basis of how the Law of Attraction works, the Quest for Success gives you specific information on how to put that Law into practice. It guides you on a heroic quest to elevate yourself, to find love, passion, and purpose, to be happy and fulfilled, so that your success can help change the world.

In this time of uncertainty with world markets, of fear and scarcity, I've stopped listening to the media. Instead, I watch 10 minutes a day of this video, and my spirits not only lift, but the advice these visionaries give reminds me of what I can do each moment to change my own success: how to have more clarity, intention, and take action. I'm inspired and ready to take the leap and follow my own heroic quest to become more --- to use the insights gathered here to help me reach my higher purpose, to follow my passion with vision, happiness, and ultimately, success. In doing so, I can serve more, helping change the world by my changing myself.

The Quest for Success is a great reminder of the simple, yet profound steps each of us can take to change our lives, and those of others. I highly recommend you get more than one copy and share it with as many people as possible. Every change we make becomes a ripple in the pond. It's exactly what the world needs right now.",1227657600,,1421,4.378787878787879
3650372,5,B001J00S16,"Beautifully filmed.  Packed with incredibly valuable content from some of the best minds on the planet.  Practical, applicable and most of all inspirational.

You have to see it more than once to even get close to absorbing half the content.

Highly Recommended.",1227571200,,262,5.166666666666667

For the ""consciously competent"", those who know what they should be doing, and are practicing these habits, you will speed your journey by grasping the strategies and systems offered here.

Finally, for the ""unconsciously competent"", those who know what to do, and do it automatically as if hardwired to a specific philosophy of thinking, this is reinforcement to continue to grow and reach your full potential.

3650375,4,B001J00S16,"Wow!  Poignant and timely.  If ""timing is everything"", then there is no doubt in my mind that the time is now.  With the world in economic collapse and our spirits rapidly sinking into despair, we need to pause to hear this message.  It is a gift from the wise.  Accept it graciously.  Then share it with everyone you care about.  You will lift their spirits and empower them to begin to create the world we all hope for.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quest-for-Success/dp/B001J00S16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quest for Success</a>&nbsp;contains a series of excerpts from interviews of admired thought leaders about the factors that were critical to their success and their advice to us.  It is organized around common themes that emerged from the interviews.  The themes provide a roadmap to attaining and sustaining the kind of success that will make you and those who know you feel that your life was worthy.

I watched the video this morning, sitting at the edge of the couch, attentively trying to absorb every morsel of wisdom from the leaders I admire most, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, His Holiness The Dalai Lama, Sir Richard Branson, and Stephen Covey.  My wife was within earshot, busily cleaning up for the weekend.  As she overheard snippets of the interviews she kept coming into the room to share her feelings about what she was hearing.  The truths we heard in the video moved us to engage in a profound conversation about our lives and our relationships with our family and co-workers.  It stimulated a meaningful conversation that made what we heard real for our lives.  Our conversation continued after the video had completed.  Then my wife observed that this had been one of the most open and meaningful discussions we have ever had.  That statement takes on even more meaning when I consider we have been together almost 20 years.

8311631,2,B001J00S16,"I watched the movie and I did not get much out of it. I think Rhonda Byrne's movie, The Secret was a whole lot better. This movie lacked ways and means of changing your life for the better. Buy The Secret instead.",1311379200,,213,4.095238095238095
8311632,4,B001J00S16,I bought both of the Quest DVD's primarily because Byron Katie is one of the featured spiritual teachers on them.  I found all of the teachers to be very motivating and informative.  I like a couple of them so much that I plan on buying their books so I can continue to learn from them.  The only draw back with this DVD is it's editing.  It jumps from scene to scene too quickly and tries to incorporate to many images to fast.,1259366400,,428,4.182926829268292
8311633,4,B001J00S16,"Although I felt the dvd The Secret was ""cheesy"", I do not hold that opinion of Quest for Success.  For the same reasons I did not appreicate the Secret DVD, I actually do appreicate this learning tool.  My work is devoted to helping people realize their own potential to achieve their desired life success.  That means they need to have messages repeated in different forms from different people and in different ways for the message to stick.  Learning theory supports repeative messaging, and I feel this DVD took a few topic (happiness, thought, responsibility, action) and hammered the message home.  No one piece of information can cover it all, yet I feel this DVD took a little piece and did a good job of using video to deliever the message.  I have ordered copies to give to clients who were not satisfied with other DVDs on the topic.  Andrea T. Goeglein, Ph. D., Dr. Success, [...]",1240444800,2,892,4.67948717948718
8311634,4,B001J00S16,"Quest For Success is one of the most motivating and uplifting movies I have seen in a long time. It has helped me see through the clutter of my busy life and determine a very specific step-by-step system to creating the life of my dreams. I have also enjoyed many of the other spiritual-guidance films available, but they seem to say that if I just think about what I want, it will show up in my life. I tried that and let me tell you, I found that's a really easy way to wait a long time.

From watching Quest For Success I know exactly what to do to start living and creating my dream life right now.  It's great to see some of The Secret stars finally sharing their key next step instructions in ""Quest For Success"". Even more valuable (and unusual) is Quest's inclusion of highly successful entrepreneurs, including Russell Simmons and Sir Richard Branson, who share how they still live a full and exciting life balanced with the pressures of creating great wealth and corporate success.

After watching Quest For Success, I feel like I've engaged eleven new personal coaches, some for business success and others for spiritual balance, but all of them for ME! I can't wait to hear what my coaches have to say in ""Happy Wealthy & Wise""!

Quest For Success is really unique, not just another version of The Secret; it's like The Secret is Chapter 1 in the book. Quest for Success is Chapters 2 - 11!

8311635,1,B001J00S16,"This video is like a very long commercial.  The information is presented in a very chopped up way and is very frustrating to watch.  It does not do the presentors justice!  The messages are lost in the ""splices"".",1231545600,5,212,4.526315789473684
8311636,3,B001J00S16,"Not quite ready to drink the Kool-Aid... I had high hopes for this DVD because it had such potential... Dali Lama, Desman TuTu, Richard Branson...etc. What I was most disappointed in was the cheesiness of the production, and its ""snippet and soundbite"" style.  I was hoping to listen to mini-interviews with the peopled featured in the DVD.... instead I got snippets and soundbites of what they might have to say about a loosely formed topic.  The DVD seemed to ramble about... throwing themes and concepts at the viewer faster than I could follow... it never really came together.  The Dali Lama is not featured much, compared to other self-appointed self-help gurus... some of whom I liked... and a few who I give little credibility.... Some of the more heavily featured folks are simple trying to promote themselves as wiser than they actually are... and get you to buy their stuff.  Sorry to sound negative... but some of the speakers I simply got a horrible vibe from... as in ""you are so fake!!!  I don't believe ANYTHING you say.  You are so full you crap!  I got tired of hearing... ""you deserve everything.. the universe is waiting for you to ask to be rich, happy and beautiful""... if often sounded like nonsense.  It is so SELF SELF SELF centered.

Another drawback about this DVD is the segways between the topics....the are painfully repeated over and over and over... and are too long... I call them the Burning Eyeball... newagey graphic segways...which are followed by new-agey video of hawks flying, people kissing on vacation, people getting massages and getting out of fancy cars.... golfers golfing, or ocean waves crashing... I found it very hokey and distracting.

Having said all that... the core idea is very cool, and very inspirational... despite the drawbacks... & being so overloaded... having the best Self Improvement people all chiming in on... believe this, believe that... do this, do that... Yes I realize the viewer can opt to adopt the practice or not... I just found it all a bit odd.  It's as if the producers had these great interviews... and instead featuring great individuals... they decided to create a DVD around concepts and ideas (which they call THE QUEST FOR SUCCESS)... the problem is... they lost all sense of continuity in chopping up the interviews into soundbites.  And I don't know what they were thinking with the excessive segways.. just a bad choice...its as if they had to take up time to make the dvd 60 minutes... I would have rather heard more actual interviews.  The one thing this DVD does is allows you to comparison shop these inspirational book writers and speakers.

I will watch again.... it's just painful to sit through bad parts to get to the good parts.",1229040000,6,2725,4.844827586206897
