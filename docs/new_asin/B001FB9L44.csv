8301812,2,B001FB9L44,"Just thought I'd let everyone know that most of these are silent films from 1927-1928.  That is not to say they are bad films, just maybe not what you were expecting. I have not bought or watched these films.  Just belive this is something most buyers would want to know and I did not see any indication in the product description. Hichcock movies for about $2 each may still be a good buy.",1247184000,,390,4.328767123287672
