8105963,5,B000E5LEWY,"Such a wonderful and classic Gene Autry movie.  When I went through an illness and was up very early in the morning, my cable provider had many of Gene's movies.  At about 3 am, there was nothing better to watch and helped with my frame of mind and moods, nothing like his movies to bring you up.  Gene represented courage, loyalty, sincerity.  Always a smile and a song.",1449705600,2,371,4.411764705882353

8105965,5,B000E5LEWY,"I bought this expensive DVD because of Barbara Pepper. She was a wonderful supporting actress in many, many movies and tv shows like Green Acres (she was the original Mrs. Ziffle). She played may bit parts in I Love Lucy and so many more programs. She was one of these background actresses that never go the recognition that she should have. she always played supporting characters. She was a beautiful cubby woman who could play any part. She does have more of a starring role in COLORADO SUNSET. It wouldn't have been the same without her tough fiery role. Sadly, her last know and recalled role was as Mrs. Ziffle. She was replaced by another tough actress after her passing during Green Acres.",1423612800,2,697,4.67479674796748

Autry is at his best. Gene has about half of his movies restored and they are working on the rest.  More fun to look forward to seeing.",1339977600,,311,3.9838709677419355

Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

2. Smiley Burnette
Date of Birth: 18 March 1911 - Summum, Illinois
Date of Death: 16 February 1967 - Encino, California

Second special footnote, Lester Alvin (Smiley) Burnette an American singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 different musical instruments, was a successful comedy actor in Western films over three decades --- The popularity of Burnette's Frog Millhouse character, with his trademark floppy black hat, was such that when Autry left for World War II service he did sidekicks duties with Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson and Bob Livingston, plus nine other films with Roy Rogers. After leaving Republic Pictures in 1944, Burnette became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the long Durango Kid series. Starrett starred in the series from 1944 until 1952, and that pairing resulted in more than 50 films. After the Starrett series was over, Burnette joined Autry for his final six films, all released by Columbia Pictures in 1953.
