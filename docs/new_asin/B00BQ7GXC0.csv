8572440,5,B00BQ7GXC0,"One of the best Hammer/Universal and Peter Cushing movies! It has all any fan of classic monsters horror action of Universal and Hammer
movies a mix of action and horror. Cushing is excellent as the good 'bad' Captain Clegg hiding out on an island as a preacher operating a
smuggling ring with his Night Creatures [skeletons riding horses] that terrorize the Romney Marsh! sound familiar? yes the same story as
the Disney movie with Patrick McGoohan but I think this was done much better but both are excellent. I can't say quality about dvd since I
have had a bootleg for years and then got the official release in the Hammer collection set. This is only review of the movie.",1427587200,,676,4.641666666666667
