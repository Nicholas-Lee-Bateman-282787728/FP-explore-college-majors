8642110,5,B00IHPOUPQ,"I have been waiting months for Skip to release this video!  I've been a student and fan of Skip for many years.  If you want to achieve a fantastic long, lean body along with a calm, relaxed mind - work out with Skip Jennings! Through the years his workout classes are and have been something I look forward to! I especially love his dance-based classes/workouts (not to worry - no dance background required)!  I will gladly provide a more detailed review after the DVD is released!",1393545600,,482,4.5813953488372094
