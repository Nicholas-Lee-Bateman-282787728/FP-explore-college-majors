Well filmed and directed!  A MUST have for the serious collector.  I have already ordered Season 3 and will get Season 4 (the final year) as soon as it is released!",1163203200,,306,4.135593220338983

2293223,1,B0009IW88U,"Check out the prices and you'll realize this is a horrible deal.  Still on Amazon, season 1 costs $19.97 and season 2 costs $44.99.  Together, that's $64.96, which is almost $20 less than the $82.66 for the set here.  Doh!!

But the shows are really quite good, one of the best new shows in the last 5 years and one of the few where you really would want to own them on DVD.",1133654400,18,374,4.082191780821918
2293224,5,B0009IW88U,"I started watchin Nip/Tuck flipping through channels one night, came addicted ever since.  The show definetly keeps your attention, they never focus too much on one character.  There is always something different going on.  If that is not enough to keep you coming back to watch it then how about two georgous doctors and beautiful women and what happens when they all come together.  If you are interested in adult mauture,(yet kinky) head turning surgeries and great mysteries of ""the Carver"" Nip/Tuck is definetly something you will want in your collection!!",1133308800,6,561,5.131868131868132
2293225,5,B0009IW88U,"Oh, I didn't want or plan to like 'Nip/Tuck', but once I watched it for a while I had no choice.  I dunno why I do, as overwrought prime-time soap opera isn't really my bag, but  I'm fully ensnared at this point.  I guess it all comes down to the fact that the main characters on this show are all likable and interesting, and even kinda believable, in spite of the melodramatic, crazy world they inhabit.  God knows why, but I actually care about these characters, which is all it takes to make you want to watch a show. (Not that doing that is easy)  On top of this, it is just a bit more intelligently written than you'd imagine, with the characters actually developing over the course of the series, and in a reasonably convincing way. (Like how Christian and Sean pretty much reversed roles over the course of the series, though they've each kinda moved back towards the center again)  It is kinda self-conciously outrageous at times, which sometimes makes it a bit silly, but this weird sorta stuff is pretty amusing, in its way. (Though some of it detracts a bit from the show as a whole)  My only real complaint regarding the show are the surgery scenes.  Gory horror films are one of my major passions in life, but I've never cared for watching surgery, and it turns out that I don't much like faked surgery either.  It is generally very convincing, however.

Eh, I dunno how to review a TV show.  I like this one, though. A lot.",1120262400,12,1438,4.429657794676806
