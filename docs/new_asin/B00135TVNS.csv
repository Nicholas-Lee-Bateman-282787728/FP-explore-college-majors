3102298,4,B00135TVNS,"It's not the quality of most of the newer shows that are out but a chance to see this again is amazing. I managed to watch a few episodes when I received my order and was instantly brought back to my childhood.  I would recommend buying this just cause it had all episodes and movie in one collection,  go ahead and look up the other collection of this show and see what you'll end up paying for it. This was 1/4  of that cost.",1424304000,2,427,4.059523809523809
3102299,5,B00135TVNS,"I was a little hesitant to buy this (even with the great price) due to some of the negative reviews claiming it was bad quality. After taking a leap of faith, I'm glad I did. Sure, the picture quality isn't exactly high definition, but it looks just as good as it did back when I watched it as a kid, and I've had no issues with skips or sound glitches. The menus are organized and gives a few different viewing options (English/Japanese, Subtitles On/Off). It even includes the 3 OVA's and The Endless Waltz special edition. All in all, this is well worth it.",1422662400,9,560,4.394230769230769
3102300,4,B00135TVNS,"Many of the Gunadam series have a very similar plot. What distinguishes them from each other is the character development. Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made.",1355356800,,557,4.6938775510204085

3102302,2,B00135TVNS,"I would like to start off by saying that I am a big Gundam Wing fan.  I love the series and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mecha type anime.  This review is for this particular collection of DVDs.

Ever since I bought this boxed set, I knew something was fishy.  The complete Gundam Wing series for under $75 seemed a little cheap. The cruddy artwork, typos on the box, region code free DVDs, and the lack of production/distribution company information all proved my suspicions.  It was bootlegged.  When I opened the box, there were only two regular size DVD cases in the box.  All 49 episodes are on 6 disks.  All six disks are inside one DVD case.  The second DVD case contains both the Endless Waltz movie and OVA.  The video and sound are low quality.  You can tell that it was copied.  I watched all the DVDs and I can't even count the number of glitches there were.  The picture would freeze and glitch.  If you love Gundam Wing, I would advise you stay away from this bootleg collection and buy the Anime Legends Complete Collection of Gundam Wing.",1237420800,21,1065,4.450777202072539
3102303,1,B00135TVNS,"Do not get this dvd set. Yeah, yeah. It's a great deal cheaper, but its a bootleg PoS version. The sound and video quality is sub-par. I know all of this because I made the mistake to buy this thing over a year ago. I thought, hey $40 alright. Don't do it, its not worth it. Also, from what I have heard lately there is a new re-mastered version of Gundam Wing being produced. If I was you, I would wait for that box-set.",1224028800,28,421,4.023809523809524

3102307,4,B00135TVNS,"If you have not seen the series before, go for the standard sets. This is only for the old school fans. I do not mean that in a stuck up you don't deserve it, but rather, the show doesnt hold up as well as many other Gundam series, and there are better places to spend that money on what has become a mediocre series in hindsight.
Dont get me wrong, this is a pretty near flawless release for nostalgia sake, and this has a prominent place on my shelf. Wing will always have a special place in my heart, as it introduced me to one of the greatest anime franchises of all time, but the action, character development, and political intrigue are all done better elsewhere.",1517097600,4,669,4.317460317460317

3102310,5,B00135TVNS,"For fans of Gundam Wing, I'd say this is a great buy. The art book is great, as is the extra content. It was also wonderful to have all of the OVA's as well as the Movie version of Endless Waltz. The menus are very simple, and the disks play very well on xbox.

A couple things of note that were a bit hard to find in the descriptions...There are both English and Japanese versions, as well as subtitles. So Yay. Also, picture format is 4:3, not 16:9...so get ready to have the weird black boxes for a bit, though you get used to them.",1516406400,,535,4.095238095238095
3102311,5,B00135TVNS,Everything a Gundam Wing fan could want and then some.  Comes in a very sturdy case so there's little to no worry about the contents being disturbed during shipping,1516233600,,164,4.655172413793103
3102312,3,B00135TVNS,"The artbook is cool but the two different art designs on the box and artbook etc. is kinda cheap looking, and some of the mecha art designs make the mobile suits look fat. / while watching the whole set you can tell the picture looks VHS like so yeah ... but it does come with every endless walts verisons which is badass / when checking out the extra disc you maybe clickbait by thinking its the whole cast interview ...but its another creators interview",1516233600,,455,4.428571428571429

I bought it specially for the bonus materials and they do not disappoint. I own all Gundam Wing artbooks from Japan (including magazines) and I am still impressed to see many artwork included in this collector's edition that I have never seen before.",1515110400,,319,4.517241379310345
3102315,5,B00135TVNS,Well I can say if you a gundam fan you'll love this set.,1514937600,,56,3.3846153846153846
3102316,5,B00135TVNS,It is best ever series of Gundam I have never seen before. I so happy to would have bought it.,1514764800,4,94,3.75

3102319,5,B00135TVNS,"Gundam Wings was one of the first animes I was introduced to back in 1997. This is a classic I had already previously owned on VHS and then DVD in the past. I was hoping for a re-release of some sort for blu-ray and was ecstatic to find out this was being released, and still by Sunrise no less!

I received mine in perfect condition and loved everything about it. The box is HUGE, so I plan use it as a little storage box and put the Blu-ray cases on my media shelf with the rest of my collection. The photobook included is REALLY nice. It's been such a long time since there was a Gundam Wing artbook release, so I treasure that most among the extras.

The dubbing is the same as always. The subtitles are clean. If you were a HUGE Gundam Wing fan in your youth, I would recommend getting this before it goes out of stock. It's a nice collectors item.

P.S. Keeping my fingers crossed that Sunrise also does this for Gundam Seed/Destiny series. :)",1514592000,3,949,4.261111111111111
3102320,3,B00135TVNS,The content in this box is amazing! It is everything a Gundam Wing fan could want. However when I got mine the box had a tare down the side and one of the blu ray cases was smashed. I am working with Amazon to get a new one however the outer box was undamaged so I think it came this way from the manufacturer! So just be careful and make sure you check all the components,1514419200,3,372,3.9078947368421053
3102321,4,B00135TVNS,"I was excited with this thing arrived but after unboxing it, it is just mammoth. The box itself is 10.5 by 8.5 by 6.75 inches. If you have difficulty picturing that, go grab a gallon container of milk and picture a box a little bit bigger than that. Half of the box is just empty space once you take the folded piece of cardboard out and pack everything back in. It really should have been half the height. This thing does not lend it's self to storage well. It's too big to go next to the rest of the dvd cases and too cumbersome to display just for looks.

I got the set because I was excited to be able to get everything, including a bunch of extras that probably would never make it out of Japan legitimately and I'm a sucker for art books, but now I have to go find someplace to store this massive box.

Other small things, the 5 cards are split between two background colors and don't look that nice when displayed together. Also in the artbook, in the character design section, it goes pilot 1,2,5,4,3, instead of how it normally goes.",1514246400,3,1042,4.284263959390863
3102322,3,B00135TVNS,Binged the series during the Christmas weekend but when I got to Endless Waltz I get a broken box what the hell. Christmas is ruined.,1514160000,3,133,4.36
3102323,5,B00135TVNS,This amazing collectors set includes the entire gundam wing series as well as the endless waltz OVA and movie with the bonus never before released in America frozen teardrop sequel.,1513814400,3,181,5.066666666666666
3102324,5,B00135TVNS,"Right Stuf hits out of the park once again with the North American debut of Gundam Wing.

The series begins with five elite Gundam pilots arriving on Earth shaking things up between the warring factions. Of course theres plenty of space and earth battles, politics, a little romance, the usual Gundam troupes are here, but it never gets old.
Also the score gets you pumped. (Can we say the opening is one of the best of all time?)
Without a doubt Wing was the post popular spin off of the main show. The series is a satisfying 49
Episodes followed by a movie that wraps things up perfectly.

The transfer is solid, taking its quality from the Japanese blu rays. Sound is crisp and clear with both the original Japanese and English audio.

The box set is massive and well worth the price.  Unlike a recent box set (cough speed racer cough cough)
This set costs half of that and includes everything and then some.

The entire series, movies, OVA and also an exclusive bonus disc that has the frozen teardrop drama and some more interviews.
Small posters, artwork, pins, some cards and a beautiful art book are all housed in a massive chipboard box.

This set is  limited so if you're a hardcore collector Id jump on this now. Im glad I got it when I did

Looking forward to their Utena set coming next month.",1513728000,9,1306,4.481012658227848
3102325,5,B00135TVNS,"I was 16 when I originally watched the series on Cartoon Network back in 2000. It was my favorite anime besides Tenchi Muyo which I also wish would make a boxset like this. I'm happy to note the box came without a scratch or a dent. There is a slight hole in the plastic maybe a half inch in diameter but that's okay. I'm going to attempt to make my girlfriend watch the whole series with me. Only thing I didn't like was the price, but how much is too much to pay for nostalgia, especially when it's as complete a collection as this?",1513641600,4,534,4.144230769230769
3102326,5,B00135TVNS,I am 100% in love with this boxset. It really is the collection of my dreams. it has everything I wanted and then some. Thank you for making such a wonderful product;,1513641600,2,166,4.21875
3102327,5,B00135TVNS,"I suppose at this point, long drivel about the contents of the set isn't really relevant.

It should be noted that the major difference between purchasing the individual volumes and the Ultra edition is that the Ultra also contains a fourth set in this disc containing all of the bonus content (on a single disc). It cannot be obtained separately and has the Frozen Teardrop picture drama, all of the interviews, the original Toonami opening etc. along with case and disc art exclusive to that disc.

As far as quality control, I've had no issues with my set. The box art is glossy all of the way around with no embossing or any other kind of frills. It basically looks exactly like it does in the online mock-ups. The art book's pages also boast a glossy finish with the pages being reasonably thick and the binding on par with something you'd pick up as a stand alone release. That alone was worth the purchase to me.
There are gripes about the pricing (both for the individual volumes as well as this set). You're getting essentially everything released under the ""Wing"" moniker. In the age of streaming services like Netflix and Crunchroll, 50 episodes doesn't seem like a lot. Sit down and try and finish both volumes in a single sitting. It's a lot of content. With the bonus disc you're looking at over 1,500 minutes of run time. Totalling out what's included in the set, it's more than worth the money. Those complaining about it now will likely be complaining about the third-party prices later. I guess everyone can't be happy.
The art cards, posters, and other goodies are what they are. I personally think they're top quality, but it's not like they're printed on heavy stock art paper or anything. I'd rather frame them than put tumbtacks through them to be honest.

The Ultra Edition is between $30-$40 more than buying the sets individually and for the extra content and that amazing art book, it's easily the best way to pick this up. Unless you really just wanted a copy of Endless Waltz, I can't imagine why you'd skip this box.",1513382400,13,2046,4.6464088397790055
3102328,5,B00135TVNS,"Gundam Wing was first released on Japanese TV in 1995. Anti-war media is understandably ubiquitous in Japan after WW 2. That said, Ive found most of the Gundam anime to be detailed, entertaining and profoundly introspective looks into the consequences of war, both on an individual and a global level.

Character development is one of the shows many strengths, a tall order given the four protagonists and two primary antagonists. In a 49-episode series, its not always possible to see the events that made everyone turn out as they did, but the main characters to develop into well-rounded characters. To learn about what happened during their childhoods, youll need to buy the Episode Zero manga.

The plot can be rather complex (needlessly so at times, with dozens of events to keep track of), but its always an entertaining romp that never slows down.",1513036800,5,855,4.972027972027972
3102329,5,B00135TVNS,"Please note that this isn't an offical review for the product, but rather why you should get it. I will update this review with probably pictures later.

If your even planning to buy the gundam wing series on blu ray, it's STILL going to be very expensive. As it stands The Collection 1 and 2 blu rays of the series are 49.99 each, while the ova and movie collection of gundam wing is 34.29 which all together will cost you 134.27 WITHOUT taxes. As this is pretty much stands with only being 154.29 minus taxes which will be another 15 dollers or so, you would be stupid NOT to get this set instead.

I mean really, 20 bucks more for 5 Large Art Cards, 5 Small Art Cards, 3 Posters, 5-Piece Metal Pin Set, and as for the biggest cherry on top... A WHOPPING 180 Hardcover artbook which itself values at over 20 bucks.

With all these great extras as well as all the enitre blu-ray series of gundam wing, you would have to be brain dead to get the series seperatly.

But hey, I'm not implying that EVERYONE should buy this. This is strictly for collectors of gundam wing fans or just gundam wing fans in general. If you never seen the series and just want to watch it regardless of quality, the DVD series of gundam wing is still available for obviously cheaper price.

*Update 12/09/17
It was originally suposed to release on the 12/12/17 but appears to have been pushed back to 12/19/17

* Update 12/19/17
I guess it's out of stock even though I pre-ordered it...So I don't really know how long I will have to wait to put the pictures up and make an offical review.... Sorry.

* Update 12/21/17
So I guess it's in stock again but the price rose up unfourtuntly. Amazon told me I would get it on the 29th of december so someone might have already posted a official review with pictures.

I still have the original Gundam Wing DVD collection (and Endless Waltz DVD) Bandai Entertainment released 15 years ago before they became defunct. This Blu-ray collection surpasses that in every regard, and it makes me happy to know that Wing is finally coming back to the States after all these years.

Ever since I bought this boxed set, I knew something was fishy.  The complete Gundam Wing series for under $75 seemed a little cheap. The cruddy artwork, typos on the box, region code free DVDs, and the lack of production/distribution company information all proved my suspicions.  It was bootlegged.

The second DVD case contains both the Endless Waltz movie and OVA.  The video and sound are low quality.  You can tell that it was copied.  I watched all the DVDs and I can't even count the number of glitches there were.  The picture would freeze and glitch.  If you love Gundam Wing, I would advise you stay away from this bootleg collection and buy the Anime Legends Complete Collection of Gundam Wing.",1237420800,21,1065,4.450777202072539

Also, from what I have heard lately there is a new re-mastered version of Gundam Wing being produced. If I was you, I would wait for that box-set.",1224028800,28,421,4.023809523809524

I do not mean that in a stuck up you don't deserve it, but rather, the show doesnt hold up as well as many other Gundam series, and there are better places to spend that money on what has become a mediocre series in hindsight.
Dont get me wrong, this is a pretty near flawless release for nostalgia sake, and this has a prominent place on my shelf. Wing will always have a special place in my heart, as it introduced me to one of the greatest anime franchises of all time, but the action, character development, and political intrigue are all done better elsewhere.",1517097600,4,669,4.317460317460317

A couple things of note that were a bit hard to find in the descriptions...There are both English and Japanese versions, as well as subtitles. So Yay. Also, picture format is 4:3, not 16:9...so get ready to have the weird black boxes for a bit, though you get used to them.",1516406400,,535,4.095238095238095

3336816,5,B00135TVNS,"Gundam Wings was one of the first animes I was introduced to back in 1997. This is a classic I had already previously owned on VHS and then DVD in the past. I was hoping for a re-release of some sort for blu-ray and was ecstatic to find out this was being released, and still by Sunrise no less!

I received mine in perfect condition and loved everything about it. The box is HUGE, so I plan use it as a little storage box and put the Blu-ray cases on my media shelf with the rest of my collection. The photobook included is REALLY nice. It's been such a long time since there was a Gundam Wing artbook release, so I treasure that most among the extras.

The dubbing is the same as always. The subtitles are clean. If you were a HUGE Gundam Wing fan in your youth, I would recommend getting this before it goes out of stock. It's a nice collectors item.

P.S. Keeping my fingers crossed that Sunrise also does this for Gundam Seed/Destiny series. :)",1514592000,3,949,4.261111111111111
3336817,3,B00135TVNS,The content in this box is amazing! It is everything a Gundam Wing fan could want. However when I got mine the box had a tare down the side and one of the blu ray cases was smashed. I am working with Amazon to get a new one however the outer box was undamaged so I think it came this way from the manufacturer! So just be careful and make sure you check all the components,1514419200,3,372,3.9078947368421053
3336818,4,B00135TVNS,"I was excited with this thing arrived but after unboxing it, it is just mammoth. The box itself is 10.5 by 8.5 by 6.75 inches. If you have difficulty picturing that, go grab a gallon container of milk and picture a box a little bit bigger than that. Half of the box is just empty space once you take the folded piece of cardboard out and pack everything back in. It really should have been half the height. This thing does not lend it's self to storage well. It's too big to go next to the rest of the dvd cases and too cumbersome to display just for looks.

I got the set because I was excited to be able to get everything, including a bunch of extras that probably would never make it out of Japan legitimately and I'm a sucker for art books, but now I have to go find someplace to store this massive box.

Other small things, the 5 cards are split between two background colors and don't look that nice when displayed together. Also in the artbook, in the character design section, it goes pilot 1,2,5,4,3, instead of how it normally goes.",1514246400,3,1042,4.284263959390863

3336821,5,B00135TVNS,"Right Stuf hits out of the park once again with the North American debut of Gundam Wing.

The series begins with five elite Gundam pilots arriving on Earth shaking things up between the warring factions. Of course theres plenty of space and earth battles, politics, a little romance, the usual Gundam troupes are here, but it never gets old.
Also the score gets you pumped. (Can we say the opening is one of the best of all time?)
Without a doubt Wing was the post popular spin off of the main show. The series is a satisfying 49
Episodes followed by a movie that wraps things up perfectly.

The transfer is solid, taking its quality from the Japanese blu rays. Sound is crisp and clear with both the original Japanese and English audio.

The box set is massive and well worth the price.  Unlike a recent box set (cough speed racer cough cough)
This set costs half of that and includes everything and then some.

The entire series, movies, OVA and also an exclusive bonus disc that has the frozen teardrop drama and some more interviews.
Small posters, artwork, pins, some cards and a beautiful art book are all housed in a massive chipboard box.

This set is  limited so if you're a hardcore collector Id jump on this now. Im glad I got it when I did

Looking forward to their Utena set coming next month.",1513728000,9,1306,4.481012658227848
3336822,5,B00135TVNS,"I was 16 when I originally watched the series on Cartoon Network back in 2000. It was my favorite anime besides Tenchi Muyo which I also wish would make a boxset like this. I'm happy to note the box came without a scratch or a dent. There is a slight hole in the plastic maybe a half inch in diameter but that's okay. I'm going to attempt to make my girlfriend watch the whole series with me. Only thing I didn't like was the price, but how much is too much to pay for nostalgia, especially when it's as complete a collection as this?",1513641600,4,534,4.144230769230769
3336823,5,B00135TVNS,I am 100% in love with this boxset. It really is the collection of my dreams. it has everything I wanted and then some. Thank you for making such a wonderful product;,1513641600,2,166,4.21875
3336824,5,B00135TVNS,"I suppose at this point, long drivel about the contents of the set isn't really relevant.

It should be noted that the major difference between purchasing the individual volumes and the Ultra edition is that the Ultra also contains a fourth set in this disc containing all of the bonus content (on a single disc). It cannot be obtained separately and has the Frozen Teardrop picture drama, all of the interviews, the original Toonami opening etc. along with case and disc art exclusive to that disc.

As far as quality control, I've had no issues with my set. The box art is glossy all of the way around with no embossing or any other kind of frills. It basically looks exactly like it does in the online mock-ups. The art book's pages also boast a glossy finish with the pages being reasonably thick and the binding on par with something you'd pick up as a stand alone release. That alone was worth the purchase to me.
There are gripes about the pricing (both for the individual volumes as well as this set). You're getting essentially everything released under the ""Wing"" moniker. In the age of streaming services like Netflix and Crunchroll, 50 episodes doesn't seem like a lot. Sit down and try and finish both volumes in a single sitting. It's a lot of content. With the bonus disc you're looking at over 1,500 minutes of run time. Totalling out what's included in the set, it's more than worth the money. Those complaining about it now will likely be complaining about the third-party prices later. I guess everyone can't be happy.
The art cards, posters, and other goodies are what they are. I personally think they're top quality, but it's not like they're printed on heavy stock art paper or anything. I'd rather frame them than put tumbtacks through them to be honest.

The Ultra Edition is between $30-$40 more than buying the sets individually and for the extra content and that amazing art book, it's easily the best way to pick this up. Unless you really just wanted a copy of Endless Waltz, I can't imagine why you'd skip this box.",1513382400,13,2046,4.6464088397790055
3336825,5,B00135TVNS,"Gundam Wing was first released on Japanese TV in 1995. Anti-war media is understandably ubiquitous in Japan after WW 2. That said, Ive found most of the Gundam anime to be detailed, entertaining and profoundly introspective looks into the consequences of war, both on an individual and a global level.

Character development is one of the shows many strengths, a tall order given the four protagonists and two primary antagonists. In a 49-episode series, its not always possible to see the events that made everyone turn out as they did, but the main characters to develop into well-rounded characters. To learn about what happened during their childhoods, youll need to buy the Episode Zero manga.

The plot can be rather complex (needlessly so at times, with dozens of events to keep track of), but its always an entertaining romp that never slows down.",1513036800,5,855,4.972027972027972
3336826,5,B00135TVNS,"Please note that this isn't an offical review for the product, but rather why you should get it. I will update this review with probably pictures later.

If your even planning to buy the gundam wing series on blu ray, it's STILL going to be very expensive. As it stands The Collection 1 and 2 blu rays of the series are 49.99 each, while the ova and movie collection of gundam wing is 34.29 which all together will cost you 134.27 WITHOUT taxes. As this is pretty much stands with only being 154.29 minus taxes which will be another 15 dollers or so, you would be stupid NOT to get this set instead.

I mean really, 20 bucks more for 5 Large Art Cards, 5 Small Art Cards, 3 Posters, 5-Piece Metal Pin Set, and as for the biggest cherry on top... A WHOPPING 180 Hardcover artbook which itself values at over 20 bucks.

With all these great extras as well as all the enitre blu-ray series of gundam wing, you would have to be brain dead to get the series seperatly.

But hey, I'm not implying that EVERYONE should buy this. This is strictly for collectors of gundam wing fans or just gundam wing fans in general. If you never seen the series and just want to watch it regardless of quality, the DVD series of gundam wing is still available for obviously cheaper price.

*Update 12/09/17
It was originally suposed to release on the 12/12/17 but appears to have been pushed back to 12/19/17

* Update 12/19/17
I guess it's out of stock even though I pre-ordered it...So I don't really know how long I will have to wait to put the pictures up and make an offical review.... Sorry.

* Update 12/21/17
So I guess it's in stock again but the price rose up unfourtuntly. Amazon told me I would get it on the 29th of december so someone might have already posted a official review with pictures.
