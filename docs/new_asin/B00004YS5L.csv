1379404,5,B00004YS5L,"Few soprano have left us with such a breathtakingly beautiful and totally accurate live recording of the two taxing arias from Il Travatore as Leontyne Price.  For a larger voiced soprano (soprano spinto to be exact) Leontyne Price shows exceptional flexability and exquisite control in the upper reaches of her voice.  Listen to her excellent breath span as she sings both Tacea La Notte and D'amor Sull'ali Rosee.  Truly amazing.
I've heard sopranos, both large and small voiced, trudge through these arias-especially D'amor Sull'ali Rosee-without heeding Verdi's carfully placed dynamics.  Disaster!!  It's alot of screaming!  Ms. Price sings pianissimos, diminuendos, and fortes in the appropriate places and where called for she generously gives forth lush full chest voice at the bottom.  As for coloratura, she seems to be almost uninhibited by the size of her voice.  It is truly amazing to listen to such a voice with it's thrilling virbrato from bottom to top sing perfect trills and almost seamless, beautiful cadenzas.
Ms. Price will be forever remembered as the difinitive Aida of her day.  Why??  Well, listen to Ritorna Vincitor.  It is sheer exquisite beauty, dramatically sound and yet every note in place.  The same can be said for the seletctions Adriana Lecouvreur and La Forza Del Destino.  Leontyne Price, whether singing lyrically, dramatically, plucking out difficult coloratura passages, or trilling us with flawless high pianissimi, truly is a marvel of vocal perfection.  This is prime buy.  I would encourage anyone whether an opera lover or not to buy this VHS.  It's truly worth it.",1012003200,4,1612,5.23828125
1379424,4,B00004YS5L,meant for any real tupac fan who loved his work and energy. 2pac did not play around on stage and it shows here with him putting his all into the stage performances. great show and crowd pleaser to see the man behind the mic up close and personal delivering a memorable performance at it's best. Only bad side is: he was more of an opening act and not a headliner. snoop dogg and tha dogg pound closed and it was great but tupac was greater giving you raw energy of everything he had.,1469836800,3,484,4.21505376344086

1379449,5,B00004YS5L,"I recommended for all 2pac fans, the only thing i don't like is the concert at club 662 becuase its not widescreen",1196380800,3,114,4.2272727272727275
1379450,5,B00004YS5L,"Incredible. I have never actually seen Tupac live but watching the the concerts put me right there in the action, I truly felt like I was there. The House of Blues performance was far better quality than that of club 662, but the club performance still delivered a since that Tupac was back none the less. It was also great to see all of the Death Row artists truly supporting each other on stage; this truly displayed the fact that they were all fans of each other's music. I loved it and recommend it to all of the Tupac and Death Row fans.",1194739200,10,542,4.271844660194175

1379452,5,B00004YS5L,"There is an injustice in the fact that Price, in general, sung live much better than when she was in the studio recording.  I own the CD ""Leontyne Price: The Ultimate Collection"" and the two Il Trovatore arias are really not as amazingly sung as she does in this video.  Here, Price has to deal with the oddities of a TV studio with cameras, and workers and yet, her singing has never been better!  ""Di tale amor"" is worlds better than her disc recorded version.  Here, the coloratura is finely placed and accurate, where as on my CD -- not so much.
However, what prompted me to write this second review was a listen to the CD's ""D'amor sull'ali rosee"" compared to this video.  In this video, I am at a loss for words as to my disbelief of this person's singing.  So effortlessly.  The only word that I runs through my mind the whole time while watching is... ""perfection.""  Plain and simple perfection.  Glorious floating lyrical lines.  That bird-like vibrato that quietly flutters.  Soaring high notes.  Also, look at her body as she sings --a mastery of body alignment and balance.  Her breathing technique is feat to be matched!  Notes are just perfect.  It's like a bedtime lullaby.  What she does with the ending lines, how she breathes a jumping line into this heavenly trill -- only she can do.
The woman just exudes such dignity and prominence into her singing.  For a Black woman in 1963 to go on television and blow every other soprano out of the water with her etherial singing is ...  wonderful.",1059350400,7,1509,4.567164179104478
