4483707,1,B004VPUQZ4,I could not use the product as it was coded for another country. Very embarassing for a Christmas gift. Clearly the site cannot be trusted.,1325376000,,139,4.6
4483708,5,B004VPUQZ4,"Discovered Gavin and Stacey on Netflix,and after watching 1 minute I knew how good this show was. We watch the first season ,watched it over and then decided we will view this over and over(then purchased the complete collection).We have watched it 3 times in 4 months and will continue,its that good.",1323216000,3,301,4.8076923076923075
4483709,5,B004VPUQZ4,This is one of the best British sitcom around. I purchased the complete set. Every actor in this show is great. I highly recommend it.,1323043200,2,134,4.4
4483710,5,B004VPUQZ4,"Adam Arseneau. DVD Verdict --Despite the namesake, this show succeeds due to its stellar ensemble cast. Gavin is a straight-laced and perpetually adolescent. Stacey is charmingly nave. The coming together of their respective families--ah, therein lays the magic. The creators of the show, James Corden and Ruth Jones cast themselves as the best friends to their respective protagonists--the oafishly charming Smithy and the caustically sardonic Nessa, whom themselves experience a small amount of romantic tension, shacking up drunkenly despite hating each other immediately on first sight. Gavin's parents, Pam (Alison Steadman) and Mick (Larry Lamb) are doting and comfortably middle-class; his mother obsessed with making a good appearance and babying their boy. Stacey's mother Gwen (Melanie Walters) is single parent in less-than-middle class Welsh neighborhood and solves every problem by making it an omelet. The indomitable Rob Brydon plays Bryn, Stacey's overly enthusiastic uncle and surrogate father figure who never lets his lack of real world knowledge damper his excessively cheerful world view.

Gavin & Stacey: The Complete Collection is a repackage of the three standalone seasons plus Christmas special, presented in a cardboard sleeve. Audiences get the entire show run, from start to finish in one convenient package, which is absolutely the way to be consuming this show: marathon sessions consuming entire series in single afternoons.

Presented in stereo Dolby Digital, the audio is clear and unremarkable. Dialog is well-balanced and environmental noises feel well-placed and accurate. Bass response is minimal, and English SDH subtitles are included--which can be helpful for some of the thicker Welsh accents. The pop soundtrack fits the series well. The anamorphic widescreen transfer stays remarkably constant throughout the series, with a clean picture, balanced colors and moderate black levels. It gets a bit soft in place, but nothing unremarkable for a BBC television series.

Extras are plentiful. The first disc, Series One, contains some featurettes (""How It Happened,"" ""Behind the Scenes in Leicester Square""), audio commentaries with Ruth Jones, James Corden and Christine Gernon, and outtakes. Series Two contains commentary tracks, outtakes, a set visit on the Welsh program Uned 5, James Corden and Ruth Jones visiting Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and a featurette (""Story of Series 2""). Series Three contains outtakes and cast favorite moments, photo galleries, a behind-the-scenes featurette with cast interviews (""No Longer Occurin"") and a ""12 Days of Christmas"" featurette. Not too shabby.

4483711,5,B004VPUQZ4,"Oy.  what's occurring?
Gavin and Stacey is one of my all time favorite TV shows that I refuse to delete from my TiVo and have found myself watching over and over and over and over again.  For the longest time only season one was available in the United States on DVD so I am beyond delighted that they have finally made a series collection of all the episodes.  Pre-order done.
Now all we need is series 4.",1313452800,8,406,4.246753246753247
4483712,5,B004VPUQZ4,Everything one would expect from James and Ruth; definitely not like a regular fictional biographical story.,1424908800,,108,5.8125
4483713,5,B004VPUQZ4,"This is a review of the show, not the DVD collection. I watched the show on Amazon Prime. It's a great show. You really have to appreciate the British humor in the series.  It's very well written, the characters are hilarious and all work well together. Not much American comedy is entertaining these days. I binge watched this show and got through the series in 3 days.",1423612800,,370,4.522388059701493
4483714,5,B004VPUQZ4,This is hilarious and have seen many of the actors in American films recently. What a stellar cast!,1418688000,,99,4.555555555555555

4483716,5,B004VPUQZ4,I love this show! Gavin and Stacy is so quirky and fun. The characters are fantastic. The Welsh slang is hillarious and colorful.,1404000000,,129,4.6521739130434785
4483717,5,B004VPUQZ4,"Get this set. This is one of the sweetest sit-coms I've ever seen. Although it's centered around a young couple, the characters are all ages and it appeals to all ages. LOVE it! Sort of like Jim and Pam from The Office, sweet & British style.",1400198400,,242,4.282608695652174
4483718,5,B004VPUQZ4,"I love the cast of quirky, lovable characters. Superb acting and feel-good story line. Definitely in my Top 5! I decided to buy it as it's a series I intend to watch over and over again.",1389657600,,186,4.194444444444445
4483719,1,B004VPUQZ4,"The discs cover the whole series, but I can't play them because they're NTSC format which is no use to me in Australia where PAL is the standard. It seems I've wasted my money!",1389657600,,176,4.205882352941177
4483720,5,B004VPUQZ4,"We received this a few days after ordering which was great.  We had never seen the original series although heard it was very funny so we were keen to find out for ourselves.....we were not disappointed.

This series is just brilliant, so funny, it is hard to determine who is best as all the characters are very funny.  We could not stop watching this we enjoyed it so much and were really disappointed when we got to the end.

Brilliant set....highly recommended!",1380672000,,465,4.634146341463414
4483721,5,B004VPUQZ4,"If you like funny BBC T.V. programs, you'll love this. This series has the typical oddball characters only the Brits can come up with.",1375056000,,134,4.625
4483722,4,B004VPUQZ4,loved this series! It was very entertaining and i will watch it again. Reccommend this to others. I hate that you have to write so many words for the review!!!!,1374451200,,160,4.366666666666666
4483723,5,B004VPUQZ4,"Why is it that the best series end after only a few seasons but the Big Bang Theory goes on year after awful, annoying year?  I know it was the writers' decision, but I just love this show so much and would love it if they made at least one more special.  It's absolutely hilarious.  Smithy and Nessa are two of the best characters ever.  I'm skeptical about the American version.",1373155200,2,380,4.309859154929577
4483724,5,B004VPUQZ4,Loved every minute of this collection. Lush!!!!! Fantastic Brit humour (with a 'u') for an ex pat like me living in the US. I watched one episode and ended up watching several back to back. Great buy!!!!,1370563200,,203,4.513513513513513

4483730,5,B004VPUQZ4,"I caught a few episodes of this series on BBC America and was immediately hooked! Reading that there will never be more than 3 seasons, I decided to get this boxed set for myself for Christmas, and I've enjoyed every minute! If you're a fan, but the complete collection, you won't be sorry.",1326672000,,290,4.490566037735849
4483731,1,B004VPUQZ4,"I became acquainted with Gavin & Stacey just over a year ago and it was love at first sight for me. At the time, only the first series was available to purchase in the USA so I did and then I bought the rest of the series on iTunes. My whole family loved watching this best of British comedy series and were overjoyed when we realized that the complete set was being released in September of this year. Without hesitation, I bought it as a family Christmas present and we sat down anxious to watch them all on tv, instead of just through our computers.

For the first series, which we already had on DVD, everything seemed fine. The quality of the DVD was excellent and we had no complaints.

However in episode 5 of the second series, without really giving anything away, there is a barn dance. One of my family's favorite scenes is when Nessa and Bryn start singing Islands in the Stream while everybody else does a great country dance until Jason shows up. You can only imagine our surprise then when Nessa and Bryn announce they are going to sing a song and then all of a sudden Jason shows up. There is no song, there is no dance. We thought it might have been a fluke so we kept watching.

In the season finale, however, another scene was cut. I immediately contacted Amazon.com assuming that my disk must be defective. They sent me out a new set immediately but when I went to play it this evening, those scenes were missing again. I started comparing the disk lengths of the PAL or UK versions of the disks to the NTSC or USA versions and I was astounded at what I found.

So if you purchase Seasons 1 - 3 + the Christmas Special in the USA you get 556 Minutes and the UK version you get 622 minutes. That's almost an hour extra of Gavin & Stacey.

I certainly don't want people to think that Gavin & Stacey is not an excellent series, in fact it's one of the best, but I was so disappointed with receiving a shortened version that I didn't want anybody else to be taken by surprise.",1325635200,152,3593,6.2591093117408905
