2301829,2,B0009MWELW,"This nonsensical fairy tale had plenty of eye candy, and not much else. The script just doesn't make any sense at all, and the acting....if you can call it that, is sub par at best...I've seen better acting from those Bowflex Infomericals......what a mess!",1123977600,,256,4.840909090909091
2301830,1,B0009MWELW,"I guess I'm running out of videos to rent at Blockbuster.  Bloody Mary was a teenage movie that had really nothing to do with the Bloody Mary urban legend.  The three teenage girls at the slumber party may have tried to conjure up ""Bloody Mary,"" but what they got was the ghost of another Mary that died in 1969. Besides the bad special effects and acting, a lot of it didn't make any sense or connect. It left me wondering, what does one thing have to do with another?

It was funny though. In one scene a guy get suffocated to death with some flimsy plastic.  I would have just ripped a hole through the plastic bag so I can breathe!",1123200000,,635,4.223140495867769
2301831,2,B0009MWELW,"This is the first of the Urban Legend films
I've ever seen, so I can't comment on the
others. However, I can't imagine that ""Bloody Mary""
does very much to promote the longevity of the series.
The movie is fine if you're into senseless,
teenage-orientated, B-movie material. Otherwise,
keep it moving.

The plot(?)is basic and totally unbelievable.
According to legend, in order
to reach Bloody Mary you have
to be in the dark, facing a mirror, calling her
name 3 times.
Ok???????????
Did I accidentally skip over this in the movie?
Because all I saw was an ALLEGEDLY ""teenage"" chick
sprawled on the floor in Victoria's Secret
underwear, saying Bloody Mary 3 times while her
friends giggled unexplainably. Then, they all suddenly
vanished for a couple of days. The greatest
disappointment is that there's a survivor; thus causing
this celluloid shipwreck to go on longer than needs be.

With such an elementary script, bad acting, and
laughably ridiculous special effects, I thought
this was a made-for-TV flick. I guess this means
I'll have to start giving the TV Networks more credit.",1123113600,2,1086,4.994475138121547
2301832,1,B0009MWELW,"I am one of the few people that liked Pet Sematary, directed by Mary Lambert as well.  I didn't expect much from this film, but even considering that, I can't express what a complete waste of time watching this was.  It kinda reminds you of Prom Night II Hello Mary Lou in a few storyline aspects, along with a couple of other films.  Nice job on the camera angles at the girl's slumber party, I'll say that much for it.  Do yourself a favor and get caught up on something else, anything other than watching this piece of garbage.  You won't like this film, I promise you.  Go watch ""Cursed"" instead.  Now that was decent!!",1122681600,,623,4.3652173913043475

2301834,2,B0009MWELW,"In what feels like a totally slapped together film with little to no feel of the previous films, we get this ""supposedly"" third chapter in the Urban Legend film series. I have been told that this installment was not really originally part of the franchise, but they added the 'Urban Legend"" moniker to it, and have now passed it off as part 3. This seems true as the film feels like a totally seperate film with a different agenda. Sure, they added a link to the previous sequel, but that was probably afterwards. I enjoyed the original film, and thought it was a stylish and fun little film, but was turned off by the coldness of the sequel. This film feels more along the lines of ""Hello Mary Lou : Prom Night II"" than to ""Urban Legend"". It's only when characters mention urban legends that you realize, 'oh, this is about urban legends"". The movie starts off promisingly. The year is 1969, and a prom night prank goes horribly wrong, and Mary Banner dies as a result of this stupid jock prank. Jump start to present day, and we have Samantha Owens(Kate Mara)and her two friends trying the 'Bloody Mary' legend. They resurrect the vengeful ghost of Mary, at the same time they too are abducted in the same kind of prank that Mary and her friends were a part of 30 some years earlier. Now Mary is on a quest to take out the latest pranksters, and to guide Samantha to the truth so she can rest in peace. The movie is filled with plot holes, inconsistencies, and things that just do not fit with the entire movie. They have a fun premise, but the script is just too full of holes and oddities. At the end of the movie, you are left wondering about this and that. How did they know that?. What will happen with this?. A lot of it isn't explained beforehand, and it sure isn't afterwards either. They have an idea here, but the writers can't elaborate or explain. They figured out the idea, but couldn't make a realized script out of it. It is horribly written. A lot of the acting is amateurish, and the death scenes themselves are hardly affective. The deaths are too over the top and ridiculous to be frightening or affective. It's just ""whatever"". There is no nudity in the movie, but the opening slumber party scene was bordering on soft core. It was so obvious and exploitive, that it was embarrasing. Not that it isn't necessarily a bad thing to see, but it was handled so un-subtley. Director Mary Lambert, who did both ""Pet Semetary"" movies, has a nice eye for detail and some settings. Still, there are moments that are quick cuts into the movie, and they mostly feel incredibly clunky and out of place. This isn't to say that it's all bad. There is some cheesy, guilty pleasure fun to be had out of it, and Kate Mara is an appealing and spunky presence. There are some nicely filmed scenes and settings, and the images of Bloody Mary are sometimes eerie and creepy. As far as direct to video horror sequels go, it is far better than the usual. Then there is Grace. Played by Tina Lifford, Grace is the new ""Reese"". Tough chick who tells it like it is. There is a connection here with Reese as well. Foxy Brown was Reese's hero, and Grace is done up like Foxy Brown. A nice little wink to the audience and to Reese. But at the end of the movie you wished Reese would come and blast the idiots in the movie and start kicking some a**. Bloody Mary is a clunky and poorly thought out film, but still manages to be watchable. Figure that out.",1121904000,,3446,4.40282131661442
2301835,2,B0009MWELW,"An unsurprisingly lame direct-to-video sequel, UL-BM is alternately convulated and dull. The plot is too needlessly complicated to really get into (especially for slasher fare), let's just say it involves a prank gone awry, a ghost, mysterious characters, and a questionable link to urban legends. While there are elements from ""The Ring"" and ""Candyman"" (which this film rather blatantly acknowledges), this is really a rip-off of the (far superior) ""Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II"" (the dead prom queen locked in the trunk is a direct lift from that film). The death scenes lack suspense and intenisty, although the death by spider scene comes close. At least the film doesn't look cheap: Sony actually tossed some money into this to give it a glossy sheen. Too bad the script and direction (by Pet Semetary's Mary Lambert) is so mechanical and uneventful. The real problem is the character of Mary herself, an urban legend that comes across as scary as a turnip. Ultimately, UB-BM comes across as a limp addition to the slasher genre.",1121731200,,1035,4.988439306358382
2301836,4,B0009MWELW,"First you will notice a review stating that this movie stole it's theme from Candyman, actually the Urban Legend of Bloody Mary has been around a lot longer, as most people will recall.

Aside from that, this movie is strong from start to finish. While any slasher/teen horror flick will be predictible, this movie feels more thought out than the other 2 in this series.

the story follows a legend based in the 60's, where a girl dies during prom night after a prank goes wrong.

Mary has awoken thanks to the chant and the prank that's awfully similar to the one that happened over thirty-years ago.  Mary Lambert, who did Pet Semetary directs, which helped this film a lot.",1121731200,8,676,4.608333333333333
2301837,2,B0009MWELW,"Sadly enough, a series that rips itself off. Mediocre and cheap scares abound, the killings are sometimes silly and laughable, yet unique. Another instance where the first segue into series is the best. I don't remember this movie ever being in theaters and it could well be that it is a direct to video release. Unfortunately, the main character and heroine of the film, Kate Mara is a strong lead and acts fairly well in this script that is bogged down in its own title, mired in ""urban legend""  as the descendants of a prank gone awry are systematically killed off in lurid, gory ways in the tradition of many known legends (example: the hand being licked may not be by the friendly pet dog, who is dead in the closet!) The story is familiar- a prank goes awry at a high school dance and young Mary is accidently killed by her jock boyfriend (or is she?) and he hides the body in a locked trunk in a school storage room but it is never found. Over thirty years later, three girls at a slumber party call her name ""Bloody Mary"" three times and BANG Mary is back from the grave to exact her revenge! Wow! Shades of ""Candyman""! But the writers here are shameless and mention ""Candyman"" in the script and claim ""Candyman"" ripped off the Bloody Mary legend! After the formulamatic story continues, mayhem, madness and murder ensues and if you are wise enough, the killer and ending becomes crystal clear before the end. Too bad the victims weren't as bright as the viewers and could have saved themselves. If you are a true horror fan, you may well gobble up this goop, but I give 4 stars to the lead who should look for better scripts in the future but sadly, 2 stars for the film is as generous as I can get. Go to a video store and rent this if you must see it. If you are an avid collector, buy it as the three pack set and don't waste your money buying this title alone.",1121212800,3,1873,4.336182336182336

2301839,4,B0009MWELW,"Released in 2005, ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary"" chronicles a series of horrific deaths at a Salt Lake City high school and the sister & brother who try to figure out what's really happening (Kate Mara and Robert Vito). Tina Lifford plays a pot-smoking older woman who assists the kids while Lillith Fields plays the title character. Ed Marinaro is on hand as the well-meaning stepfather running for mayor.

The first two films in the 3-part series  1998's ""Urban Legend"" and 2000's ""Urban Legends: Final Cut""  were conventional slasher movies, but this third installment shakes things up by adding a supernatural angle, borrowing elements of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" (e.g. the high school boiler room). While all three are stand-alone movies they're connected by their emphasis on urban legends and the college campus or high school environment, not to mention an older black woman who teams up with the students. The first two were released to theaters whereas this one went direct-to-video, but that doesn't mean it's inferior; it's pretty much on par with the first two movies, albeit not as slick, and in some ways arguably better. That may be blasphemy to fans of the first movie, but  come on  it's not like ""Urban Legend"" was some masterpiece of horror. No matter how you slice it, the first movie was a hackneyed, cartoony, contrived, over-the-top and unbelievable slasher flick; the revelation of the killer was particularly roll-your-eyes, not to mention the movie wasn't scary. It was, however, slickly made and entertaining with a great cast. The sequel was similar and highlighted by the film school angle plus Jennifer Morrison as the protagonist. This third installment, albeit less polished, goes for something a little different, is less over-the-top and succeeds with the horrific manner the eponymous character dies and the ensuing vengeful spirit.

Speaking of Mary's horrible death, there are three other notable death sequences, which involve a tanning booth, spiders and an electric fence. The deaths are just more memorable than the first two flicks. In addition, the movie features a few quality females, including curvy Audra Lea Keener and cutie Olesya Rulin, not to mention Kate Mara makes for a solid heroine. Lastly, this one switches the filming locations from Toronto area campuses to a high school and surrounding neighborhoods in Salt Lake City. ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary"" may not be great, but it's a decent horror flick with links to the previous two movies (e.g. Foxy Brown and the various urban legends) and delivers the requisite goods despite a flawed climax.

The film runs 93 minutes and was shot in Salt Lake City, Utah.

2301859,1,B0009MWELW,"I have just witnessed what is possibley one of the worst films to ever be released directly to dvd, and I can not blame them for doing so: terrible acting, dreadful plot and atrocious special effects. This was avoided to hit the cinemas at all costs to prevent further humiliation.

What we all know of the famous urban legend of Bloody Mary is nothing like it shows in this cheap flick. I would not mind if the story is altered in order to make it more entertaining, like most Hollywood films based on a true story or events, but this was just unexcusable. Whatever you've heard of Bloody Mary growing up as a kid is illustrated probably the complete opposite, and more than likely make you lose interest short after the movie started.

The acting was simply disgusting and annoyed me whenever one of the characters had to say their lines. In the scene where the three girls are pillow fighting, supposedly 'laughing' as well, was literally torture to my ears and would of preferred getting repeatedly striked in the head with a baton. I can not even recall seeing any of the actors portrayed in this movie in any recent project, and I do know why; this killed their short acting careers.

You may ask at this point, why did I keep watching this horrendous excuse of a film when I was grossly revolted by it already in the first 20 minutes? Because I knew that the ending was gonna be even shoddier, and I couldn't be more right. Check out the special effects in the finale and try not to laugh your head off.

2301864,4,B0009MWELW,"""Bloody Mary"" is the third installment of the Urban Legend series of films, and it is loaded with twists and scares.  Although not quite as scary as the first two movies of the trilogy, ""Bloody Mary"" has plenty of hair-raising scares of its own.

The movie begins in 1969.  Mary Banner (Lillith Fields) and three of her friends are attending the homecoming dance with their dates.  As the evening wears on, the guys slip something into the girls' punch.  However, Mary doesn't drink hers.  The guys try to drag the groggy girls into a car, but Mary sees what's happening and runs.  Chased by her date, she is cornered in the electrical room of the school gym.  A fight breaks out between Mary and her date, and Mary ends up falling and hitting her head.  Thinking that Mary's dead, her date puts her in a locked box and leaves her.

The movie then proceeds ahead 35 years.  Samantha Owens (Kate Mara) and her friends Gina (Haley McCormick) and Mindy (Olesya Rulin) are having a slumber party.  The girls have been ""blacklisted"" by members of the football team because of an article written by Sam about jocks squeaking by in school and receiving credit for football. The girls begin talking about urban legends; namely, ""Bloody Mary"".  The legend says that if someone says her name three times, she'll appear in a mirror.  The girls try it out, but nothing happens: yet.  The guys are out for revenge and ""kidnap"" the girls and lock them in an abandoned building; much like 35 years ago.  However, this time, everyone survives.

But, the legend of ""Bloody Mary"" has been awakened, and soon, students are dropping like flies at school.  One is killed by a swarm of spiders; another as a vending machine falls on him.  Many of the students suspect that Sam and her brother David (Robert Vito) are responsible for the killings.  Is it Sam, or is it ""Bloody Mary"" who has come to seek her revenge?

Despite some negative reviews, I found this movie to be quite good.  I thought the story about ""Bloody Mary"" was well-conceived, and there is plenty of blood and guts to go around.  The best scene of the movie is the one where the spiders crawl out of the girl's face.

I recommend this movie to people who have seen the other movies in the series and fans of horror movies alike.  You don't necessarily need to watch parts I and II before watching this one, as they are not really related.  If you like scary movies, then don't miss ""Bloody Mary"".",1192492800,,2443,4.558620689655172

Honestly, it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It was so cheesy and the acting was absolutly terrible. I don't know if I have ever laughed so hard.

2301868,2,B0009MWELW,"The ""Urban Legends"" franchise still goes on, with the latest entry featuring the ""legend"" of ""Bloody Mary."" According to this film directed by Mary Lambert (known for her two ""Pet Semetary"" films), the titular Mary really existed in 1969, who is supposedly killed late at night ... well, sort of. Cue to a bunch of high school students, some of whom chants her name three times in the dark room unwittingly to awaken the vengeful dead girl. And they start to be killed in a weird fashion one after another.

As you know, this urban legend was a famous one, previously used in such films as the 1992 horror film ""Candyman"" (to which Lambert's film refers briefly). Unfortunately, ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary"" does not know what it really wants to do. Except for some scenes involving spiders, the film is not creepy enough. It also awkwardly attempts to inject some dark humor into the story, but the film is not just funny, especially after watching more gruesome ""Final Destinations"" series.

The mysteries of Bloody Mary and her death are not interesting, and the truths about it are predictable for most horror film fans. Not that ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary"" is a terrible film, but after all, except for the ""Mary"" part, this film has little to do with urban legends, and is just an ordinary horror film.",1179705600,,1309,4.762114537444934
2301869,1,B0009MWELW,"The ""Urban Legend"" franchise has been pretty steady for the past couple of years. I just don't understand why this movie was made. It shifts from the slasher feel of the previous two movies and delves into a more supernatural focus. The film is pretty bad. I'm definitely a huge fan of horror movies and it doesn't take a lot to impress me but this was just mediocre.

The acting is extremely sub-par and this is especially disappointing because Kate Mara is in the cast. She delivered some pretty good roles in ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""Jack & Bobby"" but she goes through this movie, along with the rest of the actors in an incoherent storyline that shifts from scene to scene with no depth. It's hard to care about the characters at all. They just float around with seemingly no purpose. I even almost quit watching the movie halfway but being the avid horror fan I am, I had to continue.

There is only one really cool death scene that gave this movie 1 star. It involves a pretty girl and a spider. Most of the rest of the death scenes are just retreads of urban legends the characters talked about in the past two movies. The film even has a cameo scene from ""Final Cut"" in which a character is watching a porn on the TV.

Bloody Mary for me was very enjoyable. The movie brought something knew to the table. The title ""Urban Legend: Bloody Mary"" is a mystery to me of why it was chosen. This movie is very much unlike the others and the creators probaly just put Urban Legend in the title to bring more attention towards it. The deaths in the movie are very cool and the acting is not too bad either. The story was somewhat predictable but kept me watching.

Samantha began having hallucinations and haunting dreams of some girl getting murdered and her body put away.

Freakish incidents such as death by tanning bed, spiders coming out from a wound, crushed by a vending machine; started happening to some of her friends and the authorities were baffled by these cases. In her school and the rest of the public however, people kept on starring at Sam like she has something to do with it after what she had published in their school newspaper. the only person who believed her was her twin brother, who kept by her even though what she's experiencing was pretty outrageous to believe. While they are sleuthing for answers, they found out all of these accidents happened before, when their parents were still at school.

This is one heck of a horror movie but isn't up to my standards of excellent horror movie cause it's more of a scary by music score instead of the actual movie being scary. But the storyline kept you watching till the end cause it's a race. I love Mary Banner's ghostly makeups and gimmicks.

2301872,3,B0009MWELW,"It seems like every time I buy a movie I haven't seen, I end up being very disappointed.  This is one of those rare exceptions - it was actually about what I expected, which is to say average.  It starts back in 1969, as some jocks give some Spanish Fly or something to 3 girls.  Two of them get really sick, the third runs away.  Her ""boyfriend"" chases after her and she ends up falling, hitting her head, and dying.  Her name was Mary.  Flash forward to the present.  Three hot babes are having a slumber party.  One of them has written an article for the high school newspaper that makes the football players look like idiots.  They discuss the Bloody Mary legend:  Chant her name three times, etc.  So they chant her name.  Later that night the football players pull a prank on the girls, locking them in some building.  They're missing for a day or two.  Once they get back, scary things start happening to the football players.

The first part of the movie was pretty good, but around two-thirds of the way through it started to drag.  It turned into more of a murder mystery than a horror movie (Wouldn't you know it, some of the people involved in the 1969 murder are still living in the town).  Yes, there's not a cliche left unused by the time this one is over, but that's okay because they're woven together into a fairly good story.  Overall, a weak three star movie, but this one girl is so incredibly hot in her underwear scene than it almost - almost - bumps it up into a four star movie.  If it only had held the excitement and intrigue through to the end.  If you liked movie such as Cherry Falls (which has an almost identical plot as this), and Decoys, which has a similar atmosphere, you'll probably be moderately entertained by this.  It doesn't have any completely unlikable characters like the first Urban Legends movie, which is very unusual for a modern day slasher.  Video quality is the best I've ever seen on a DVD - you can use the 4X zoom and the picture is just as clear as if you weren't using the zoom at all.

Their kids do it in the now days passing it on as tradition (TRADITION! What parent would pass on getting girls drunk and doing stuff to them as tradition?!!)

Kate Mara (Tadpole, Nip/Tuck) and Robert Vito (Spy Kids 3D, Buffy The Vampire Slayer) try to figure out what happened and also try to stop Mary and put her soul to rest....it's pretty formulaic and dumb.

Chanting her name will make her rise from the dead! Oh Boy. The whole movie boils down to the fact that Mary was murdered many years ago and her body put away where no one would ever find it.

2301879,3,B0009MWELW,"This latest entry in the URBAN LEGENDS collection is a lot better than I thought it would be.  Director Mary Lambert (Pet Sematary) gives us a creepy little thriller that's more of a mystery than an out and out horror film.  Mary Banner and her friends back in 1969 were drugged and seduced by a rowdy bunch of football jocks.  When Mary is accidentally killed, the jock locks her body in a trunk and hides it away.  Switch to current day and a young girl and her friends are given a drug and undergo a similar experience, only this time they all manage to survive.  But seems like Bloody Mary is seeking revenge on the children of the boys who did her in. Filmed with a cast of unknowns (except for HILL STREET BLUES Ed Marinaro and feisty Tina Lifford), the movie has some creepy moments, most notably a creepy segment featuring some deadly spiders.

2301881,3,B0009MWELW,"I was pretty psyched when I saw there was a third addition to the Urban Legends series - the first film was fantastic, and the second one was also pretty good.  Then I saw that Urban Legends - Bloody Mary was a direct-to-video release that seemingly had nothing to do with the first two films.  At that point, I just hoped this third film wouldn't be too awful.  While the film falls far short of its predecessors, Urban Legends - Bloody Mary isn't all that bad.  It has some definite weaknesses, but it also has a nice sampling of blood and gore.

There are many variations on the old Bloody Mary story, but it makes for classic urban legend fare.  Look in the mirror, say Bloody Mary's name three times, and she appears - and then the fun begins.  Apparently, a mirror isn't actually required after all, as young Samantha Owens (Kate Mara) apparently conjures the restless spirit without one after hearing the story of a local girl supposedly killed back in 1969.  The next morning, she and her slumber party friends turn up missing.  This is a real weak point in the story, as the whole missing episode is not handled well at all.  Anyway, a connection seems to be established between Samantha and Mary Banner, the girl who was killed all those years ago.  The only difference between the two girls is the fact that Samantha lived to tell about her disappearance (although, for unexplainable reasons, neither sets of girls ever told authorities who was responsible).

Those responsible for Samantha's disappearance start dying, in rather gruesome ways, which makes Sam and her brother David (whom some blame for the murders) exceedingly unpopular at school.  By about the second murder, the whole urban legend m.o. is applied rather loosely, and the whole thing becomes basically a slasher film.  Still, there's still the Bloody Mary connection, and Samantha comes to believe that the killer is the ghost of Mary and that she is killing the children of those responsible for her death.

There's no denying that Urban Legends - Bloody Mary is an exceedingly predictable little film.  Mary's killer might as well have walked around with the words ""I did it"" on his forehead.  There are some decent-sized holes in the plot, as well.  As I mentioned, the disappearance of Samantha and her friends doesn't add up, and that gets the film off to a shaky start.  Then there's the obvious question: why did neither of the sets of girls tell authorities who were responsible for their disappearances?  That makes no sense at all.  As for the climactic scene, the filmmakers decide to go crazy with visual effects for some reason, and that is another negative.

Still, I enjoyed this movie.  The special effects for Bloody Mary herself are pretty good, and the deaths are reasonably gory (although we sometimes only see the aftermath of them) - if you hate spiders, I'm warning you right now that you do not want to watch this movie.  You really have to judge this film on its own merits, as it really has next to nothing to do with the first two Urban Legends movies.  Since the filmmakers sort of just ignore the whole urban legend m.o. for some of the later murders, it really doesn't belong in the series at all.",1126396800,11,3208,4.695885509838998
2301882,1,B0009MWELW,"Another movie in a stream of bad horror films that are being recently released (see most any Lion's Gate film).

Acting wasn't too bad, but the story has already been done in other movies so many times (revenge for the ghost, find ghost resting place, etc.)

And why do nice people become evil when they become ghosts, just wierd.  Bloody Mary gives a nice ""thank you"" smile to the main character for helping her at the end, but I'm sure the main character hates her guts and would never accept the smile, could have been a good scene (argument with ghost, etc.)

I could not put my finger on just why I was getting this feeling until I saw this scene.  It's the scene where this guy was on the bed dangling his right arm off the bed for his dog to lick his hand.  Then, he saw the words ""humans can lick too"" on the mirror.  I immediately remembered watching I believe the movie Camp Fire Tales (I don't know if I got the title right), which was put out back in 80s or 70s I think.  This Urban Legend Bloody Mary totally ripped this Camp Fire movie off!  I felt cheated out of my mondey I telly you.  Anyways, this movie was a total nonsense.  Former Urban Legend movies had ""who done it among the people you know"" surrounded the story.  The killer always was someone who was alive, so you just had to figure out which was the killer and why they want to kill others off.  This movie Bloody Mary version was all about some ghost killing the people off.  You know this very earlier in the movie, so they were no mistery surround the movie, which made it very boring.  The ending was very predictable, which I figured it out half way through the movie.  After watching this movie, I wanted to get my money back from the rental store.  I have watched many bad movies before, but never felt like I wanted to get my money back.  But, this movie has a lot of ripped off scenes from other past horror movies, so I felt like I was watching all the past movies that I already seen all over again.

2301884,4,B0009MWELW,"Let's face it, we horror fans have to be picky nowadays. A lot of horror films these days are just downright annoying or silly. I know this, and that is why my horror collection is not too wide. Yet, for a film that hardly has gotten any reviews, I must say this is probably one of the better horror films that has come out recently.

I myself was critical to see no reviews on the back of the film, but I thought it would be fun to see the story of Bloody Mary into film. I was really just curious how they would play it out, since there are so many versions of Bloody Mary from the  medieval queen to a girl with a horrible disease, etc. it goes on and on. They made this story different though, making it a poor woman who was the victim of a prank gone fatally wrong. Now she has come back as a vengeful spirit, awakened by one girl's summoning supposedly, prepared to kill the children of the people who had caused her fatality. And she does it in the most gruesome ways, but that is what a good horror flick does, frightens and grosses you out, and that is what this film does actually well.

Bloody Mary herself was a beautiful young lady, but as a vengeful spirit she is just downright creepy and her eyes are ones you don't want to look directly into. Basically, she is a cool figure to see. Some parts of the film are B movie material, but nothing that bothered me too much. The acting was all right as well, one or two actors were kind of fake, but there were other actors, especially the lead girl who summoned Bloody Mary in the first place, that strengthened that area. I myself thought this film would be kind of dumb in the beginning because girls in their underwear, throwing pillows at each other, is corny and silly, but don't let that throw you off. The movie gets a lot more better and realistic in the next few minutes.

Overall, despite the negative reviews on this site, I would recommend this movie. It is an interesting twist of the old tale of Bloody Mary, with a few good supporting actors and just an entertaining horror film to watch.

If I had to either get this, or some of the recently viewed horror films I have seen that came out of the actual theater, you can bet I would get this instead.",1125187200,5,2224,4.24822695035461
2301885,1,B0009MWELW,"I couldn't believe when I heard there was yet another Urban Legends movie! The first one was the best slasher film of the day, better than Scream in my opinion. While Scream was more interested in making fun of the slasher horror genre, the first Urban Legend was only concerned with suspense. Not to mention the setting was much darker with its gothic architecture. The second wasn't great, but it still had a somewhat interesting storyline and some tense moments.

Then there's the UL movie dubbed ""Bloody Mary"". As soon as I read the envelope that came with the movie and saw it was a direct to video, I cringed. Then the film opened with giggling girls pillow fighting in underwear. That was when I threw out my last shred of hope.

Good thing too. This movie is nothing at all like its previous counterparts. First of all, it's not a murder mystery....well, sort of not. Some girl named Mary gets accidentally killed by someone some years ago. To someone who's watched a lot of horror movies and knows that ""B"" movies don't usually go for involved, surprising plots, this one wasn't a hard one to figure out. I had it nailed pretty much from the begining of the movie.

Another problem I had was the ghost itself. They tried really hard to rip off ""The Ring"" and other recently popular Asian remakes. Unfortunately for them (and the viewing audience) they failed from the get go. I know she killed one person (in a gruesome, spider zit scene that was almost too much for ME to take!) with an Urban Legend but then I think they kind of dissolved into ""Let's just kill this person in some way."" or they completely rehash deaths from the first two films.

At least they tried to tie this film into the previous one. They briefly mention the killings at Aspen College (the film school from the second one if I remember correctly. I watched it right before watching this one and I still don't remember!). But it doesn't live up to even that film, the first film leaving this one in an embittered cloud of dust.

Too many changes made this movie suck. It looked horrible, sounded horrible, and tasted horrible. But maybe this movie won't drive you as insane as it did me and you'll leave out the part where you try to eat this dvd out of existance.",1124841600,3,2247,4.511056511056511
