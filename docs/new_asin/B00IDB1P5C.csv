6259821,4,B00IDB1P5C,"Only God can bring someone through that kind of Hell.  Considering Anita Dittman is in her 90's, she is articulate and truly amazing in telling a difficult story.  A great inspiration for all.",1415404800,2,192,4.787878787878788
6259822,5,B00IDB1P5C,This video is a testimony of Ms Dittman's trial during the Holocaust of WWII. She survived and has many stories to tell of how she prayed for God's help and was miraculously saved from disaster each time. She is Jewish born and gets saved and knows her Lord Jesus before the Holocaust starts - and then begins her life's journey as a Christian praying to God for help each step of the way while dodging the NAZI's throughout Europe. Very well worth watching. Encouraging and a blessing. Will bless you to see how God blessed her and took care of her.,1400889600,9,550,4.455445544554456
