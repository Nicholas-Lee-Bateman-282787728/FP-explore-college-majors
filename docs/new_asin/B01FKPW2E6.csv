7750410,1,B01FKPW2E6,The lead actress is too annoying for me. Her whiney voice and facial expressions had me switching the DVD off. Will stick to the books,1467763200,4,134,4.4
7750411,5,B01FKPW2E6,"I'm basing my review off seeing the movie on TV. I'm new to the Hallmark mystery movies and have to say that Aurora Teagarden would be my favorite series of the 4 that I've seen advertised, with Garage Sale as my second. I have only seen one movie each of the Murder, She Baked and the Flower Shop series. Of the two I saw, I liked Murder, She Baked much better, but would be open to seeing more from each of those series (I'm not sure how many there are of them), especially Murder, She Baked. While I liked some of the Garage Sale ones (though, I haven't seen two of them, which I will check out later), it was mostly because I enjoyed watching Lori. As a Full House fan, though Aurora Teagarden and Garage Sale are my top two favorites of the four, the reason was not only because of Candace and Lori, but also because of the supporting characters. I didn't really connect with the supporting characters very much in Flower Shop, for example. However, I felt the same way with some of the Garage Sale ones, too.

What makes the Aurora series my favorite of the four is a mixture of Candace's energy/fun personality and the pacing of the storyline, along with, of course, the supporting characters. Marilu Henner, for instance, does a fantastic job at playing Aurora's mom. I feel like the Aurora series keeps my attention best of the four (it also will make me laugh out loud) and does very well with throwing in multiple twists and turns to keep you on your toes and second guessing yourself about who the murderer is. Although Hallmark movies, especially the mysteries, are not for everyone (there is a similar feel to them, yes), I think the Aurora series stands out from the rest, as it's a perfect balance of twists, humor, romance, and drama for a Hallmark movie. I enjoyed the new one (Three Bedrooms, One Corpse) the most, out of the current three. I really do think they only improve with each one. I'm also liking the new character, Martin, who will be in the next one this Fall, too. I've never read the book series, so I'm not sure how many he will be in.

(EDIT: November 2016 - The newest movie in the series, which premiered last month, is definitely the best one of the four that have been made so far. I'm sticking to what I said about the movies only improving with each one. I thought this most recent one had better dialogue, more intrigue, and it was even higher quality than the ones before it. I'm looking forward to the next one, as I assume they will continue to get better and better. This is a really great series that I enjoy and watch each time Hallmark Movies re-airs them.)

If you enjoy Hallmark movies and like mysteries, I would highly recommend the Aurora Teagarden series.",1467072000,2,2711,4.450704225352113
7750412,2,B01FKPW2E6,"This one is totally ridiculous, she's running around with her head chopped off asking everybody on the street if they know who murdered somebody including the murderers.  No mystery sleuth would do this and her deductive reasoning was out to lunch. The script writer/writer for this series needs to take a break and review there thoughts processes on what it takes to make a good murder mystery.",1466467200,2,395,4.895522388059701
7750413,4,B01FKPW2E6,"I don't know that Ive ever heard of a club of people who meet to discuss real life murders, but thats the premise of Real Murders, the second Aurora Teagarden Mystery movie from Hallmark Movies and Mystery.  The premise is executed perfectly, too, and anyone who enjoys a light mystery will enjoy this one.

Aurora Teagarden (Candace Cameron Bure), Roe to her friends, has long been a member of the Real Murders club, a group of true crime lovers who meet to discuss the details of long ago famous cases.  However, this particular night the meeting never happens because one of the members has been found murdered.  When Roe hears about it, she immediately recognizes the similarities to the case they were planning to discuss that night.

The coincidence is too much for Roe, who is certain that someone in the club is the killer.  However, when she and her mother Aida (Marilu Henner) are sent a box of poisoned chocolates the next day, she realizes that the members of the club might also be the next target.  Can Roe figure out the next target in time to stop the killer?

Okay, so the type of group might be original, but the basic plot of a group being targeted by one of their own isn't exactly new.  Still, it is very expertly done, and I was completely stumped on who the killer might be until Roe figured it out.  There are several suspenseful scenes before everything is wrapped up, and we get a laugh or two as well.  I also liked the fact that the first murder really impacts the group.  Yes, I read and watch a lot of murder mysteries for fun, but it is nice to see some real emotion connected with the death upon occasion.

I actually watched the two films on back to back days, so I was able to see how some characters and their relationships grew.  I enjoyed that, especially since it meant Roe was getting the recognition she deserved for figuring things out.  On the other hand, I did notice some strangeness since Roe seems to have not moved in to the house she got in the first movie.  Probably has something to do with the fact that the books these movies were based on were published in a different order than the movies are being made.  Dont ask me why, but its a minor detail as far as I am concerned.

It might also explain why Roe has a different love interest in this movie.  While a brief mention is made of things not working out with the minister from the first film, new love interest Robin Daniels (Robin Dunne) gets plenty of screen time since he is a mystery writer who plays a big part in helping solve these murders.

I do have to issue the standard disclaimer.  This is a Hallmark original movie, and there is a certain amount of cheese to be found here both in the dialogue and the acting.  Keep that in mind, and youll be fine.

The movie is based on a book originally written by Charlene Harris.  If you are paying attention, some of her books get a pretty prominent display at one point in the movie, but you do have to be watching for it.

This movie won't be for everyone, but those who enjoy light mysteries will certainly enjoy Real Murders.  Its a twisting mystery that will keep you engaged until the end.",1465516800,13,3153,4.393103448275862
7750414,5,B01FKPW2E6,"The thing I really hate about mysteries is when you can solve it right away. I'm a mystery junkie, kind of like roe and the club, so I was really surprised and pleased that the culprit wasn't guessable. They really have done these 2 movies well and I like how I can watch with my grandma and there was nothing scandalous. She couldn't figure it out either and she's a super mystery buff like I am. I can't wait for the next one. I'm hooked.",1464566400,39,440,4.188235294117647
7750415,5,B01FKPW2E6,"Real Murders is the second in the series of Aurora Teagarden movie mysteries by Hallmark.  The book is actually based on the first book in the Charlaine Harris series, while the first movie A Bone To Pick is based on the first book.

As I had read several of the books first, I was a tad confused at being plunked into the middle of the story when this series began.  By this second movie, I was expecting there to be a few inconsistencies with the books because of the re-order of the stories, so it wasn't that disconcerting.

As expected, Aurora Teagarden's (Candace Cameron Bure) romantic relationship with the police detective Arthur Smith (Peter Benson) is not really part of the story (it was referred to obliquely in the first movie.)  Instead, the movie has a developing kinda sort friendship between Aurora and Arthur's wife, homicide detective Lynn Smith (Miranda Frigon.)  They have replaced the tension of having had a relationship with the same man to one based on Aurora's investigations into the murders that Lynn is investigating.

The book begins with the book club convening for their meeting to discuss the Wallace murder, in which the husband was convicted of murdering his wife without any evidence.  Before the meeting can start, the detectives arrive to inform one of the club members of his wife's murder.  Aurora, known to family and friends as Roe is the first to notice that the wife has been murdered in the same fashion that the Wallace wife was murdered so many years before.

The quick conclusion is that there is a copycat killer who is targeting members of the Real Murders Club.  Aurora and her cohorts, especially her best friend Sally Allison (Lexa Doig) and her mother's new boyfriend and prior president of the Real Murders Club, John Queensland (Bruce Dawson.)

Roe is a part time librarian who lives in and oversees some townhouses that are owned by her mother Aida Teagarden (a well-to-do realtor played fabulously by Marilu Henner.)  A lot of the action is played out near the townhouses.  Roe has a relationship begin with her favorite mystery author Robin Daniels (Robin Dunne), who has literally just moved to town.  She and Robin team up to try to solve the mystery.

The relationships between these characters is really wonderful. Mother and daughter behave to one another in the snipping and loving way you would expect to see in a family.  The friendship between Roe and Sally is a real pleasure to see.  Roe and John play off one another as they competitively conspire to figure out the crime and catch the murderer. Even watching the growing relationship between Roe and Robin was fun and amusing.

While the characters and relationships once again made the movie for me, the plot was also very well done (thanks to both Ms. Harris and to those who adapted her book to the screenplay.)  I remembered enough of the book to make solving the mystery a little bit easier than ordinary.  On the other hand, my husband did not figure out the whodunnit until just before the reveal, so it ranked high for him  as a mystery. I saved my recording from the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries Channel and plan to watch it again in the near future as well as play it for family and friends who did not see it on TV. I also plan to pre-order the movie as soon as it is available as mysteries are my favorite movie, television, and book choice.

While the subject deals with a murder mystery, it is absolutely in line with Hallmark's family friendly character.  The story is clean and is something you can sit down to watch with various generations of kin and not feel uncomfortable. The movie series is actually more family friendly than the book series. I always look to Hallmark for programming that I can watch with family and friends without worrying about anyone becoming offended.

I'm really pleased that they have developed their new channel and are filming so many great mystery movies, one of which is the Aurora Teagarden series. They are developing a number of other movie series based on book series and I could not be more pleased. I love a mystery!",1463702400,12,4095,4.709677419354839
7750416,2,B01FKPW2E6,"This is like a comic strip; everyone is a caricature.  The male lead is cracking jokes and asking the girl lead out on dates right after a murder of someone from the group he had just joined.  Even a far-fetched story can have realistic characters that the viewer can identify with.  The story starts with a murder that was the most realistic aspect of this story.  So you have a violent crime of a character that was introduced as probably the most realistic character in the movie, then you have all these goofy characters that don't seem real at all trying to solve the murders but they are acting more like people at a party playing the game ""Murder"" than real people dealing with a real murder.  The romance didn't work at all-- they had barely just met and they were very stiff and uncomfortable together.  This has the writing level of a Nancy Drew mystery for 8-year-olds but the girl sleuth is in her 30's.  The motive for the murders was idiotic and totally out of left field-- no development.  It doesn't work to mix cartoon characters with a violent crime like bashing someone with an ax.  This is a mess.",1523836800,,1117,4.49009900990099

7750419,2,B01FKPW2E6,"What I don't like about the Aurora Teagarden mysteries is her TOTAL disregard for the law and yet she's never called on it.  She's done everything from breaking and entering, to home invasion to burglary,
She's a nosy little busybody who would have gotten herself thrown in jail or shot for her being a buttinsky.  All 'evidence' she's ever produced would not be allowed in a court of law.
And the mysteries aren't that hard to solve.  My wife figures them out in the first half hour or less.",1522627200,,492,4.50561797752809
7750420,4,B01FKPW2E6,"Fair warning: all the Aurora Teagarden movies starring Candace Cameron Bure do not match the books. That shouldn't be a surprise since these are Hallmark movies. For instance, the movie Aurora  justifies her love of murder mysteries by saying she loves to solve puzzles. But there are lots of puzzles in life to distract you if need them. Aurora isn't really interested in mysteries but in true crime; If you are picking that as a topic to study then my guess would be that you also have a fascination with the darker side of human nature and what people are capable of doing. And maybe are a little macabre. That part of Aurora is shoved under the rug in the movies.

Having said that, I do enjoy the movies for the light fare that they are.

I also like the relationships in the movies. Aurora has a strange her relationship with her ex and his new wife, and her relationship with her mother is loving but confrontational. The locations are beautiful, and there are moments of humor that were a little unexpected.",1519862400,4,1015,4.565934065934066
7750421,4,B01FKPW2E6,"enjoyed this series on hallmark channel, had to have a copy for home!",1519171200,,69,4.384615384615385
7750422,4,B01FKPW2E6,"Hallmark Movies & Mysteries knows when it's got a good thing. Real Murders is the first sequel in HM&M's film adaptations of Charlaine Harris' books featuring librarian sleuth Aurora Teagarden. Who knows how much time had elapsed between A Bone to Pick and Real Murders, but it's long enough for them sparks to fizzle out between Roe and Father Aubrey.

The conflict in Real Murders hits even closer to home for Roe. This time, a copycat killer is targeting members of Lawrenceton's Real Murders Club, of which Roe herself is a member. As you know, the club is composed of true crime enthusiasts that get together once a month to discuss and debate unsolved or notorious real-life murder cases. Once again, Roe finds herself stepping into the role of amateur gumshoe. But maybe she can count on the help of her favorite mystery writer, Robin Daniels (Robin Dunne), who was invited by Roe's best friend, Sally, to attend a meeting of the Real Murders Club as a surprise present to Roe. That is, providing Roe can cross him off her suspects list.

Oh, and what an uncomfortable suspects list, packed with Roe's friends and long-time acquaintances. But Roe will hold everyone accountable. See her snoop around, chasing clues, checking everyone's alibis, inevitably, once again, getting underfoot of the police. Which brings us to Roe's relationship with Lynn Liggett-Smith (Miranda Frigon), sullen homicide detective and wife of Roe's ex. Theirs remains a prickly, catty association. Maybe with a smidge of thaw.

I guess Roe's mom, Aida (Marilu Henner), was right. She's never approved of Roe's involvement with the Real Murders Club. I liked Aida's portrayal better in this one than in the first movie. In A Bone to Pick, she came off as rather cartoony. Here, she comes off as a bit more real and shows genuine concern for her daughter's safety. I thought Candace Cameron Bure was terrific in this one, and while she still got in the way of the police investigation, at least she wasn't as obnoxious about it as she was in A Bone to Pick. In this one, she was at all times genuinely several steps ahead of the constabulary. I enjoyed how the mystery played out - how the clues were tied to past true crimes - and how fraught with danger Roe's investigation was. The sense of jeopardy really spiced up the plot.

A friend who has read the books told me that the Hallmark adaptations have given Charlaine Harris' mysteries the sanitized treatment, that the killer's activities seen onscreen aren't nearly as gruesome or grotesque as those on the printed page. My friend also alerted me to the fact that Candace Cameron Bure doesn't much keep faith with the author's depiction of Aurora Teagarden. The screen version of Roe is less plump, more perky, less morbid, more chaste, less lusty. Well, this piques my curiosity even more, makes me really want to crack open the books. And, if you must know, the review title refers to a rather ponderous dictionary.

7750485,5,B01FKPW2E6,"Aurora (""Ro"") Teagarden is a small-town librarian who solves murders as a hobby.  But she never seems to be actually working in the library. The only time she seems to be there is when she is illicitly using the staff computer to find info concerning her investigations, for which she is sometimes gently chided by the requisite old-maid library supervisor.  Ro then compliments her looks and all is well.

Ro's best friend is a local newspaper reporter, who appears to be around only to look puzzled by Ro's byzantine thought processes concerning the latest murder.  She is no less puzzled than the viewer, I might add.

The setting is a small town in Georgia, but, I'm here to tell you, this ain't Georgia.  For one thing, nobody, and I mean nobody, speaks with anything even remotely resembling a Georgia accent.  And it's raining all the time, which is not true for any part of Georgia I've ever been in.  So I looked it up, and discovered that the movies are filmed in the rainiest part of rainy British Columbia.  Why?  It's cheaper, I hear.

Ro, being a young, attractive single woman, naturally has a love interest, a handsome stud who is panting after her but who at some point is darkly suspected of being the murderer.  It's not revealing too much to say that he isn't, of course.

The only other male character of significance, other than Ro's ex-boyfriend, is Ro's mother's companion, whose only role appears to be that of standing around looking stupid. In fact, Ro's aforesaid ex-boyfriend is stupid, too. So much for the men in the picture.

The murderer is usually revealed by something dumb he or she does and not necessarily by any exceptional insight or actions on Ro's part.  And the viewer has no clue about this until the event itself, naturally very late in the narrative.  Lady Agatha would be spinning in her grave.

But, with all of this, the most amusing and fascinating aspect of the movies is Ro's tendency to make faces with every sentence she utters.  It's grins or grimaces or rolling/bulging eyes or moues or coquettish turns of the head, all of which I assume the actress (and director, too, I guess) believes to be great acting and a true representation of Ro's character.  Whatever, it's a real hoot.

Need I say, I love it all to pieces?  I watch it in rapturous disbelief.  I can hardly wait for the next installment, which, as I write, happens to be this very night.  I'm counting the hours until then.",1476576000,,2442,4.641025641025641

7750503,4,B01FKPW2E6,"Whether they're fans of true or fictional crime, I suspect most murder fans have a fantasy of encountering an actual crime they can solve.

But of course, it wouldn't actually be as fun as just reading about someone else doing the crime-solving, especially if you are not a plucky librarian with too little common sense and too much knowledge of historical crime. Based on the Charlaine Harris mystery, ""Real Murders: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery"" flings the titular character back into another pleasant, cozy murder mystery, but this time with a much improved romantic subplot and MUCH more murder.

The Real Murders Club is shocked when one of their members, Mamie, is found brutally bludgeoned to death. But even more disturbing, Aurora (Candace Cameron Bure) recognizes the details of the murder -- it's a copy of the murder the club was scheduled to discuss that very evening, meaning that only one of their own could have committed it. The only outside suspect is Robin Daniels (Robin Dunne), a mystery novelist who is also their guest speaker for the evening.

But the murder turns out to not be an isolated incident -- Roe and her mother are sent a box of poisoned chocolates, and a local politician is found murdered in his bathtub. Someone is trying to kill the Real Murders Club members in ways that mirror historic crimes, and without a clear motive, any one of them could be next. As the club starts to splinter, Roe must figure out who is killing them and why -- or someone close to her might be the next victim.

""Real Murders"" is a slightly darker affair than the first Aurora Teagarden mystery -- there are more murders, they're more gruesome and immediate, and the coldly sociopathic approach to the crimes is more chilling. One particularly effective scene involves a person almost being axed in the face. Sure, the movie still has that pleasant, wholesome PG-rated air, but the story is definitely a more harrowing experience.

And it's also a pretty well-woven mystery -- until the final act, there are plenty of suspects and not a lot of actual clues, especially since the killer's motivation is unknown. There are still some amusing moments (Sally being driven slowly insane by her parents, who think her vegetarianism is a ""phase"") but it doesn't stray long from the web of murders and frame-ups. It has that blend of the cozy, the macabre and the amusing that Charlaine Harris does best.

And thankfully, the weakest element of the first Aurora Teagarden mystery -- the romantic subplot -- is handled far better this time around. Not only is Robin a character with his own life and interests, but he's actually got interests that intersect with Roe's.

She can be a bit too precious at times, but Candace Cameron Bure continues doing a pretty solid job as a sprightly librarian who dives headfirst into crime-solving, but this time Roe discovers that it can have repercussions for people she loves as well. She has fairly good chemistry with Dunne, whose character serves mainly as the objective outsider/red herring, but works particularly well with Lexa Doig's more sensible, cautious Sally and Marilu Henner's stubborn matriarch Aida.

""Real Murders: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery"" is darker and smoother than the first movie in the series, and those who enjoy small-town cozy mysteries will probably enjoy this eerie little thriller. With a hammer or a poker?",1473206400,,3385,4.915936952714536

7750508,4,B01FKPW2E6,"Although this is the second movie in the Aurora Teagarden Mystery series, the storyline actually follows the first book in the series. Knowing this, I don't think it matters that they switched around the order.

Once again, Candace Cameron Bure, does a wonderful job in portraying the main character. I love that she is so intelligent, as well as being a bit sweet, but with nerves of steel. The new love interest in this movie, a mystery writer, balances her out perfectly. Hes intelligent too, but uses a bit more caution when it comes to heading into a dangerous situation.

I enjoyed the mystery itself as well, although I knew early on who the killer was, because of a remark that was made, and it just seemed really out of place. But since there was so many deaths/crimes it was interesting to try to figure out how each one was accomplished. And the twist at the end really made up for figuring out who the killer was early on.

Auroras relationship with her old boyfriends wife changed a bit by the end of this movie, and Im glad it did. Although theres still some tension, it wasn't as catty as it had been. I was also amused again by seeing books by Charlaine Harris during a scene that took place in the library.
If you weren't aware, this series, along with Sookie Stackhouse series (aka True Blood), and the Midnight, Texas series which is coming to TV later this year (you can read my reviews here, here and here) were all books written by Charlaine Harris.

If you enjoy reading Cozies, or like watching mysteries without blood and gore, then you should give the Aurora Teagarden mysteries a try.",1472169600,,1611,4.56401384083045
