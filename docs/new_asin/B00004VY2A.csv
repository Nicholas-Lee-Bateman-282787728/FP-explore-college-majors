1359190,3,B00004VY2A,"""LE PROFESSIONNEL"" from 1981 is at heart a comic book plotted B movie that's still a fun ride.  Here Belmondo is French spy Joss Baumont sent to assassinate an ruthlessly cruel African dictator.  But when the powers that be change, he's double-crossed by his own people and sent to hard labor at a bad, bad prison camp.  But not to worry, 'cause no prison can hold Belmondo and nothing will stop him from his assassination assignment, even if he has to pick a new target.  Cool chicks, hard guys, fast cars and a score by Ennio Morricone.  What's not to like?",1016668800,6,559,4.4950495049504955
1359191,3,B00004VY2A,"I contribute it to innocence of youth, when I gave the movie a full thumbs up 20 years ago. After hundreds of good (and bad) movies later, I was shocked to see how hollow the plot and how bad the performance of the actors really was. In order not to take away suspense (if any) beforehand, here's the plot in brief:
Belmondo, beau, hero and government agent, is ordered to assassinate a good-for-nothing African president. However, politics change, the plan is cancelled and our hero ends up in an African hard labor prison camp. Now follows a bit of chain-gang melodrama a la Papillon and a hasty but successful escape, which leaves you again wondering who the fools are: the pursuing incompetent military or yourself, continuing watching the movie. There follows a big gap and our hero is back in France, now taking revenge on his former peers, including a car chase in a totally deserted ??? city of Paris. Apparently the movie's director felt obliged to proof to the audience, that the French movie industry is on par with Hollywood.
What adds to make the movie even worse are the sounds in mono, which spoils the fantastic soundtrack by ENNIO MORRICONE, and the movie's colors. Males wear heavy lipstick like drag queens and Belmondo's tan looks too good to be real.
I gave it one star for having the pleasure watching the hero's wife in her complete Eva's costume and a call girl in her G-strings.(Never get disappointed when it comes to a French movie). The other two stars are for the great soundtrack, which enables you enjoying the DVD without watching it. Overall verdict: The heavy price tag on it, does not justify a B-type movie.",1008288000,7,1643,4.708333333333333

1359216,3,B00004VY2A,"One of Belmondo's biggest hits and featuring a memorable Ennio Morricone theme (Chi Mai) that also entered the UK top ten as the main title to BBC TV series The Life and Times of David Lloyd George, 1981's Le Professionnel veers between good and bad. Introducing himself as ""Joss Beaumont, espionage and brawls,"" it's not a bad description of the film itself. Sold out - or rather given away - by the French government that sent him before he could kill an African dictator, he escapes from prison and returns to France to finish off the job during a state visit from the corrupt politician, all the time goading the French secret services in an increasingly schizophrenic tale. On the one hand it's the kind of film that will throw in wildly over the top racist commanders, a lesbian threatening his wife with a bar of soap and a gunfight straight out of a Western with Robert Hossein's stone-cold government agent. Yet it's also smart enough to throw in a neat twist as to exactly how he plans to accomplish his hit and aware enough not to turn the dictator into a complete cartoon - having spent years in jail himself, he enjoys having the upper hand in negotiations with the French and even points out that they had three revolutions and five republics before settling on a civilised form of government but expect Africa to get it right in one. The pluses outweigh the minuses, and the Australian DVD includes both subtitled French soundtrack and dubbed English in a decent widescreen transfer, but no extras. (The French DVD has unsubtitled extras but only a dubbed English language option.)",1284076800,5,1596,4.724014336917563
1359217,5,B00004VY2A,"Jean-Paul Belmondo was often referred to as the ""French Bogart"" during much of the New Wave era in foreign cinema. After starring in classics such as Breathless and The Man From Rio, one could understand the comparison although each actor adopted a very different screen persona. Belmondo has always favored a lighter, humorous approach. By 1981, France had entered the ""gritty antihero"" phase long employed by Belmondo's American contemporaries Clint Eastwood and the late Steve McQueen. Of the movies produced during this period, Le Professionnel stands out as his best effort. Based on Patrick Alexander's 1976 novel Death of a Thin-Skinned Animal, the film version stars Belmondo as Joss Beaumont, a French government agent sent to assassinate a military dictator in the fictional African nation of Malagawi. Political winds quickly begin blowing in the opposite direction though, leaving Beaumont literally hanging out to dry. After making an easy escape from captivity, the now slightly unhinged professional decides to complete his mission while exacting payback on his former employers. By the end of the film he also manages to have not one, but three different women longing for his companionship.

The cast here is a huge plus. Former film director Robert Hossein is the sadistic Commissioner Rosen, who is obsessed with terminating Beaumont at any cost. The late Michel Beaune portrays Beaumont's sympathetic friend, Captain Valeras. Cyrielle Clair, Elisabeth Margoni, and Marie-Christine Descouard are Belmondo's love interests, with each woman adding their own take on their relationship with Beaumont. Jean-Louis Richard and Jean Desailly round things out as Beaumont's more hesitant pursuers. Director Georges Lautner is heavily influenced by Sergio Leone here, with frequent close-ups of the actors done in Leone's highly innovative style. This works very much in his favor, in particular during Beaumont and Rosen's Leone-inspired duel scene. (Belmondo was once a boxer, so his rugged features add much to the character.) Lautner is aided by Oscar-winning composer and frequent Leone collaborator Ennio Morricone, who provided a haunting score with the creation of Chi Mai for this film. It is possibly Morricone's best known work next to the theme music for The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Chi Mai is an enchanting, beautiful, and melancholic piece that suits both Beaumont's quest and his final fate quite superbly.

I own two different versions of this film: In French, with either English subtitles or Spanish dubbing. They were likely taken off European PAL releases so I can't vouch for the quality of any Region 1 transfers as the DVD is currently unavailable in this country. Even so, I highly recommend it to cinema lovers on both sides of the pond. If you manage to obtain a non-regional print that plays on a PC or video game console, please do not hesitate. It's not a long film and the plot is anything but convoluted. There is a very brief nude scene on Margony's part but no explicit sex or violence. That's not what Belmondo's films are about. Instead, he mixes action and drama with an inimitable knack for levity. He also performs his own stunts as in many previous movies. Much of the younger Belmondo of the 50's and 60's is still present here, echoing the charming daredevil of times gone by.

On a personal note, I have watched this movie several times over and it is among my top 5 favorite films of all time. Morricone's Chi Mai plays frequently on my blog. I was even lucky enough to obtain Belmondo's personal signature on a vintage poster advertising the film along with two photo cards. They are framed atop my desk as I write this review and I consider them rare gems among my autograph collection. Seek out this movie and enjoy it! You're likely to consider it well worth your time.",1255824000,14,3831,5.0585443037974684
1359218,5,B00004VY2A,"I saw this film when I was very young, at the cinema, and still
remembered the glorious ending. This film is perfect in its genre. Like
a 007 but with heart, sociological undertones and humour.

Like when the big bosses of the system look at the city from above
their crystal palaces, and the first people who help our hero are the
clochards/ beggars. Which are no saints, but whose materialism ""what is
it there for me?"" seems honorable by comparison to the chiefs.

Of course Belmondo is the best, and Morricone's score can't be
improved.
The script by Jacques Audiard has not one word that should't be there, like Poe's famous dictum.

The passage of time: This film didn't loose any power with time. On the
contrary, I feel it wouldn't be possible to make it now. Maybe it was
the simple technology, the vague appeal to honour, and the political
incorrectness. Like when Beaumont's chief, the hooker and cops speak of
the president of an African state as ""le negre"".

Josselin has a way with words, with people and strategically.
Instructor Picard goes to the point when says that ""he's got the
whites"" = always takes the initiative. This film is about mental games
when outnumbered and out resourced. As such, it could be given in a
course of strategy.

Whereas its imitators rely on the action scenes like ""Bourne identity"",
riches and gadgets (007) here life is mean and meaningless. Even a
genius like Beaumont can achieve little against a corrupt and
inefficient system.

Somebody could make a study of the use of the telescopic lenses on the
rifle. He who has it wins? Not necessarily so! But the three times it's
being used, people fall like flies, like if death didn't inflict any
pain.

Morals: Beaumont has no friends, and he barely believes in his wife or
his mistress, let alone his ""friend"". His nemesis, Le prsident N'Jala,
is pragmatical as him, but follows some codes: ""I didn't kill you
because I wanted to exchange you for something"". As is Robert Hossein
as Le commissaire Rosen. Somebody as hard boiled as himself, no less.
The ""prisonnier vad"" also has moral. As, paradoxically, Doris
Frederiksen, the stunning prostitute (I can't say more, but the ending
proves it). I'd liked more character development of Jeanne Baumont and
Salvatore Volfoni, his pal. Rosen always drawing sketches, at important
meetings or when interviewing his wife, proves he cared for nobody, it
was just another way of showing his superiority (in his perspective).
Like when he said of Volfoni, whom he just used as a bait, ""I pity
him"".

I agree with IMDb's reviewer from Bochum, Germany that: ""Today no one
makes movies like this any more..."". I was thinking about who could
impersonate Joss now? Matt Damon in ""The Bourne identity"", as suggested
by Amazon reviewer Hiram Gomez Pardo? Bradd Pitt :)?

Definitely time doesn't always bring about progress...

PS: Everyone will have its favourite quote with such a film. Mine
probably would be the Instructor Picard again when he extols his
pupils' virtues: ""I'd like my son to be like him"" and Le ministre,
still insomniac, answer: ""Ok, very moving, but it doesn't solve our
problem"".",1234742400,2,3134,4.8193668528864055
1359219,4,B00004VY2A,"ANyone interested in French movies should watch this one at least once so they would get a pretty good idea of what was done in the late 80 in France. The best actors, The best writers, the best soundtrack all mixed into one masterpiece.

Of course with todays standards this movie has BADLY aged and anyone not familiar with the nostalgia and story behind it will easily dismissed it as a laughable chessy action movie.",1199923200,,420,4.6
1359220,5,B00004VY2A,"Le professional was if I may, one of the films (Three days of the condor) that inspired ""The Bourne identity"" .

The reality has by far, much more imagination than the fiction! A secret agent (Jean Paul Belmondo in a smoldering performance) is a spy and assassin hired and sent by his government with the purpose to knock off a foreign dictator. (And in 1981, certainly there were a well nourished number of candidates, by the way, all around the world), but as you and me know, the pragmatism originates a sudden shift of purposes and he is betrayed because now he is useless. Locked away in prison, he manages to escape and take his own revenge.

The early eighties was indeed, the perfect stage in which Poland, Germany, England, USA, conscious of the progressive crumbling of U.R.S.S. employed the most unthinkable and not detailed and sophisticated strategies in all fronts; on the other hand many countries around the world firmly believed that with the end of Vietnam's War, the Fascism would be back masked of despotism, deceived democracies and corrupt regimes supported by underworld forces (you and me are aware) that based their principles and actions according the well known utterance. 2the enemy of my enemy is my friend.""

This hazardous behavior resolved temporally certain political disturbs in some latitudes, but also, permitted the blossoming of others.

The spy profession was in this sense,  a coin of multiple uses, according the wind blew. And this film suggest it briefly, although spiced with doses of that bitter humor so typical of Belmondo, the iconoclast personage by excellence, who was born and grew up under the French New Wave principles of irreverence and total disrespect for the elemental rules of authority. (Breatless, Pierrot le fou seem to confirm it.)

By the way, Georges Lautner directed a formidable film in the middle sixties with Jean Gabin that you should to search ""Le pacha""

A film that deserves major attention from all of us.",1190592000,,1979,4.960725075528701

Violent French action flick with a fairly short, classic style car chase(no CGI)in Paris. The movie does have a look and style that you won't see anywhere else...... but the purchase price is a bit much for a film that you will probably only look at once or twice in your lifetime.

1359224,4,B00004VY2A,"The plot revolves around the fact that French agent, Joss Baumont, is sent by his government to assassinate a ruthless and oppressive African dictator.  Unfortunately, before his mission can be completed, the French decide that the dictator might be a useful ally; consequently, Baumont is ""sacrificed"" by his own agency and betrayed to the dictator's police.  Baumont is imprisoned in a brutal African labor camp for two years, before he manages to escape.  What follows next is a sort of vendetta against the African dictator and his former associates in the French secret service.  Upon his escape, Baumont acts rather like a character without a soul, in that he seems completely indifferent to his ultimate fate.  He proceeds to France with the intention of killing the African dictator (who conveniently has a scheduled state visit in Paris);however, he cannot resist the temptation to notify his former French colleagues of his plans.  Naturally, what ensues is a game of cat and mouse, in which Baumont generally outwits his former comrades (who are now responsible for protecting the dictator during his state visit).  Baumont does receive some assistance with his plans from his wife and from a few assorted characters;

however, he is largely on his own as he attempts to penetrate the security around the dictator.  His most persistent antagonist is an unscrupulous police inspector named

Rosen.  Rosen is not the least bit reluctant to sanction almost any method which yields the desired result-- the capture or killing of Baumont.  This story has elements of humor, notably the scenes involving a prositute and her client and what amounts to an almost Wild West type of gunfight between Baumont and Rosen.  Ultimately, a certain measure of justice prevails in that some of the most villainous characters suffer a well deserved demise.  However, the ending of the story (while predictable) is somewhat unsatisfying--- as the viewer is left only with an empty feeling regarding the pointlessness and futility of Baumont's fatal choices.  Still, this film is worth viewing and owning for any true Belmondo fan.  On the whole, it was more entertaining than some French films which have been more critically acclaimed.",1094860800,13,2227,5.161559888579387
