8516126,5,6303954707,"This has become one of my favorite Turkey Hunting videos! I've been a huge fan of Harold and David's videos forever and this video shows some good tips and tactics, along with exciting hunts from Florida, Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas. If they showed hunts for the Merriam's Turkey in Montana or South Dakota, like I've seen in other Ultimate Spring videos, that would just about complete the Grand Slam.",1483833600,,437,5.083333333333333
