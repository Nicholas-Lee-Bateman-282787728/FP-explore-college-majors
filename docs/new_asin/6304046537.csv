The movie started out slow, but ended the way I expected.  Good always wins out over evil. I'm not disapointed that I purchased this film. TY Dwight for sharing your God given talents with the rest of us.",1351382400,,336,4.153846153846154

765819,1,6304046537,I HAVEN'T FINISHED THIS MOVIE.  IT WAS ONE THAT YOU THINK IF YOU KEEP WATCHING SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN OR IT WILL GET MORE INTERESTING.  DIDN'T HAPPEN FOR ME. I FINALLY GAVE UP AND TURNED IT OFF. THIS IS NO FAULT OF DWIGHT YOAKAMS ACTING.,1221004800,,236,4.340909090909091
765820,5,6304046537,"this was a good movie.  I didn't know what to expect since I had never seen any of his movie work, but I was really impressed.  Very touching scenes and you can see his natural talent in acting.  I recommend others to purchase.",1192924800,9,227,4.232558139534884
765821,5,6304046537,"However, I am a big Dwight Yoakam fan.  Actually, you don't have to be either to enjoy this little film.  Dwight never lets his audience down and this film is no exception.
Yoakam, as a rodeo clown, confronts more than the bulls in 'Painted Hero' and the storyline deals with much more than a weekend on the rodeo circuit.
This movie addresses a man facing his past and colliding head on with his future.  Small town political corruption, old family secrets long buried, newer family secrets recently encountered, a murder mystery, and of course the rodeo as a backdrop combine to fill this story with excitement, romance, and drama.
The soft, understated, down-home acting style of Dwight Yoakam always make you think you are just waching Dwight, as well....just Dwight.  In reality that is the secret of Dwight's talent.  Behind that easy-going, quite, good-old-boy demeaner is an intelligent, humorous, and very talented musician, singer, director, and actor.  In this movie his acting talent shines while the story entertains.
This is an under-exposed, under-rated film that deserves better.  Take a ride on the ups and downs of the 'painted hero', Vigil's, emotional return to his old hometown with its friends, enemies, secrets, and love all waiting to just 'throw him off' and you too.",1057363200,17,1292,5.037558685446009

765823,5,6304046537,"I have watched this movie several times now and I just simply love it.  Of course, I truly enjoy Dwight's acting and his music, oh and his looks too.  :-)  I like to watch Rodeo's and this movie having Mr. Yoakam in it as the tease he is, was a major delight.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1006732800,9,295,3.7868852459016393

7859743,2,6304046537,"I'm a fan of Walton Goggins so it was fun watching him in an early role.  Besides that, this movie has little to offer.  Not very well acted.  Not well edited.  Basically, not very good.  Dwight Yoakum fans can take a look at his first acting role.  It's a good thing he can sing.",1497398400,,280,4.092592592592593

7859750,1,6304046537,"The quality of the CD was fine and delivery was quick, but this movie is worthless. I didn't buy it because of Dwight Yoakum, but because Walton Goggins was in it. Bad, bad acting by everyone. It looks like one of Walton's first.",1357776000,,229,4.348837209302325
