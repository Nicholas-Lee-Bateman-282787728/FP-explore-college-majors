868365,5,6304405901,This Western captures your attention from beginning to end and doesn't let up. I originally watched this film thinking it would be a western parody (Sinbad) but was really surprised at just how good it was. It has an all star cast and great character developement. I love this movie.,1156464000,4,283,4.68
868366,4,6304405901,"The Cherokee Kid is a fun film from start to finish.  I truly enjoyed the movie all the way through. The plot is simple, its your classic revenge story where Sinbad's parents where killed and vows revenge the man that killed his parents.  The fun part is how he transforms for the young child with no real skills to survive in the west to one of the ""Greatest Gun Slingers of All Time"".  If you have a little time and want to see a Sinbad film with decent acting and fun plot, then this is your film.",1021593600,15,500,4.134020618556701

868868,5,6304405901,I saw this movie once on TV and waited for it to be repeated for so long. I happened to do a search on Amazon and found it offered for an amazing price (brand new). So I was thrilled to purchase it and watched it as soon as I received it. Love Sinbad and this movie is hilarious to me.,1397001600,,285,3.7666666666666666
868932,2,6304405901,"We love Sinbad films and comedy, and strangely hadn't come across this one and were hoping for another great laugh.  Unfortunately, this film is a huge embarrassment to Sinbad's typically clean style of comedy.  Note: this is NOT a family film.  There is plenty of language, sexual innuendo, and (comic?) sexual situations with whores.  Burt Reynolds is especially foul-mouthed and crass with his personal porno stash he wants Sinbad to help him learn to read from.  We managed to finish the film---on 2x half way through so we didn't have to suffer through the cheesy, disgusting and completely humorless dialogue, perhaps the result of being produced by HBO.  The only reason for two stars is that Sinbad himself didn't actually commit out-of-dialogue character for his persona at least at half way through the film, even if he was completely unfunny. Our family completely regrets this purchase, but thankfully it only cost about as much to rent.",1395705600,,949,5.051282051282051

868935,4,6304405901,"I thought this was Sinbad's finest vehicle...good, fun story and two of my favorite actors (Burt Reynolds and the late, great Gregory Hines)...as for Vanessa Bell Calloway...I'd watch her read the 'Yellow Pages' she's so fine...a good fun movie!",1391040000,,245,5.3076923076923075
868936,5,6304405901,I like Sinbad as an actor and buy his movies to support his clean comedic style. He includes an unique and enjoyable cast of performers in his movies.,1389657600,,150,4.392857142857143
