8682788,1,B00O9ZSNB0,"Richard is so fascinating, it's a shame that PBS fails miserably. Disjoint and random, impossible to sit through, it's an insult to Richard. The only redeeming value of it is as a bad example of how to make a documentary.

Like a bad music video, the program jumps scene every few seconds, A two second clips of Pryor, then, insert an ""also-ran"" D-list comic commenting about Richard -- another clip of Richard -- then another B-Lister, with each one trying to outdo the other in their praise.  Too bad they didn't leave out the ebullition, WE KNOW he was GREAT.  We want to know about the man, his character, and we do not need close-ups of other, 'also-ran' comics.

Richard, we hardly knew ye... Saw this on Netflix... if you must see it... see it for free there.  Two Thumbs Down and whoever did the editing/directing... keep your day job.",1444262400,,843,4.593333333333334

8682794,3,B00O9ZSNB0,"Very shortly after comedian/actor Robin Williams died this summer PBS put together a special American Masters series documentary called Robin Williams Remembered. It was released this month on DVD (you can see my review on Amazon). Now comes a similar documentary on another comedian actor  who had a troubled life  but who died nearly 10 years ago, in 2005. I guess this could also be titled Richard Pryor Remembered, since MOST of the screen time is taken up with interviews with about a half-dozen fellow comedians or friends. (Its interesting that no actors who starred with him are included nor any interviews with his family other than a former wife. (he was married four times).

The interviewees are black comedians George Wallace (who was a contemporary of Pryors in his early days appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show), and Tracy Morgan (who considered Pryor a mentor), Hispanic comedian/actor George Lopez, and white comic Louie Anderson.

We learn that Pryor grew up in the whore house run by his grandmother and that his father was a pimp and his mother was a prostitute. He turned to comedy to keep his sanity. There are many clips of Pryor from his pre-expletive days and lots from his regular appearances on the Merv Griffin show. And, though there is maybe a minute or two from the legendary HBO Live on Sunset Strip performance, there are way too few clips of Pryor performing. Sure, he used strong language  and the DVD is unedited but most of the time its the N-word that will cause people to be concerned. Both the interviewees and the narrator talk about how  in his early career- Pryor turned to Bill Cosby for influence, its interesting to note that pioneer black comedian and activist Dick Gregory is rarely if ever mentioned. It was Gregory who with the N-word as the title of his first book and it was he who used it in his night club act (for the purposes of desensitizing the word by frequent use) long before Pryor.

So, yes, Pryor was an important person and a big influence on a generation of comedians but I found that this 53 minute tribute could have been much better in telling his story. Still, its the only one ever done.

And finally, I don't know whose idea it was (probably the Director) to play a very repetitive music score both behind the interviews and the few clips of Pryor performing, but they are very distracting and, in my opinion, inappropriate to the theme of the film.

There are no bonus features on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
