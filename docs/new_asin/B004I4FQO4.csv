If you are going to make a 26 ep series you should make the character development simple. Hoever the series seemed that the writer was the 6th sense guy insteed of go nagai. It has TOO MANY plot twists. Plot twist are no bad in a series. Heck i love heroes and supernatural but in ashort siries like this one you should kkep them to a minimun. I don't want to give too much of the story away but some time you were still digesting the last plot twist and then ""puff"" here is another one. Hoever it was very interresting to finally know the origins of popular villans like baron ashura and the rest of the cast. Spoiler ahead: But the most disapointing matter of this series was the end...which was a big ""to be continued""- end of spoiler.

All and all mazinger z is still my favorite anime character and I will enjoy anything related to him. But if you want a more classical mazinger series you should watch Mazinkaizer. But this one is worth a look as well.",1296000000,,1121,4.389423076923077
