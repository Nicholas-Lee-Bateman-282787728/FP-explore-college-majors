6854238,5,B00Q57MP8C,I am so hurt about the show being camceled. I was looking foward to the next season. What alame decision to do your american BBC fans. I would not watch other BBC shows because of thos but I would be missing great showa and idont want to do that.  Maybe they would ask the fans for their input before they cancel shows in the future.,1425168000,6,333,4.123076923076923
6854239,2,B00Q57MP8C,"A great show gone horribly bad.
Yes we still have Jason/ariadne. Hercules trying to save Medusa-though we never saw her in s2/act 1. Pythagoras. Pasiphae.
And I admit it started out with a bang-pasiphae tries to take over Atlantis. And Hercules catches her trying to protect Jason at all costs.
Ariadne's temporary love interest is less than bearable.
And there's a stunning lack of humor-a big plus regarding season 1.
But what bothered me was:
1. The over done continuity. Sure the first two were a two parter. That's not where my complaint lies. It's the overly long movie style of 3-6.
2. Zombie-vampire creatures.really?? I mean you guys brought us five amazing seasons of Merlin and you're making this episode where basically nothing happens.

I know it's been cancelled but I'm still looking forward to 2b.
Anything beyond that-only time will tell.",1424995200,2,855,4.979020979020979
6854240,5,B00Q57MP8C,I too loved this show and why the BBC decided to cancel it is beyond me. I wish they would ask the public who watch their shows before they decide to cancel them.,1424563200,7,162,3.9393939393939394
6854241,5,B00Q57MP8C,"I love this show. The chemistry between the characters is awesome. I cannot wait to see what happens week after week. Then I find out the show has been cancelled. I would love to know who the genius is that made that decision. How can you take a show that is family oriented and with great plots and then cancel it. Shows like Atlantis are the kinds of shows a family can set down and watch without worrying about bad scenes, Dirty language and so forth. I am sadly disappointed in the decision to cancel the show. Oh well.",1422576000,24,523,4.292929292929293
6854242,5,B00Q57MP8C,"I really enjoyed this show, pity the BBC chose to cancel it after 6 episodes in season 2, this had so much potential, unless there are ""Unaired"" episodes that will be going direct to DVD, we are left wondering what happened.",1422144000,16,224,4.487804878048781
6854243,5,B00Q57MP8C,What would be a great and epic series is mostly a sweet memory.,1447372800,,63,3.923076923076923

6854247,5,B00Q57MP8C,Excellent video.  I enjoyed it.  After having watched Part 2 of season 2 on BBCA. I wish they would at least close out the cliffhanger.,1439251200,,135,4.36
6854248,5,B00Q57MP8C,"Why did BBC cancelled ""Atlantis""? It one of my favorite shows on television. If I had to make a choice which shows I want to watch or looking forward to see the most is definitely ""Atlantis""! I would rather watch this show more than ""Blue Blood"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Law and Order"", ""Survivor"", ""The Bachelor"", ""Person of Interest"", ""Walking Dead"", etc. This ""Atlantis"" is a great show! Great acting, very good writing with great plot and suspense! I'm very disappointed it was cancelled, I was looking  forward to see what happen on next episode or next season when Jason and his friends go to another place to meet a sorceress named Medea (Jason cousin) and possibly find the legendary Golden Fleece! In my opinion, BBC should be ashamed of themselves for cancelling this great show!",1439251200,,790,4.8088235294117645

6854251,5,B00Q57MP8C,Not a bad start (for season 2) but they really should have put more episodes of these discs. I would rather buy it later than only have a few.,1437955200,,142,3.9310344827586206

6854256,5,B00Q57MP8C,The BBC hasn't cancelled the show. Part 2of the second season will air on BBCAmerica later this year. It is currently showing in England. The BBC frequently cuts series into two parts.,1429315200,5,184,4.78125
6854257,5,B00Q57MP8C,"I previewed the first season and this partial season is a real teaser! I hope they continue this program to the end. It is very entertaining and if they complete the project, I'll definitely want to watch it.",1429056000,,208,4.5
6854258,5,B00Q57MP8C,Atlantis is one of my favorite shows. I wish it hadn't been canceled. I hope BBC America will broadcast the rest of season 2 or at least make it available to order.,1428969600,2,164,4.15625
6854259,5,B00Q57MP8C,"A fun, lighthearted series with a new twist on the old greek myths.  Much like Merlin has great storylines and is family friendly.  Mark Addy adds a comedic touch as Hercules.",1427932800,,175,4.612903225806452

8690362,4,B00Q57MP8C,"I love this first half of Atlantis, but the second season prepares you for a darker tale of the Jason legend that, unfortunately never got a chance to take off. The show was cut short and cancelled after the second season. As a result, the ending kind of leaves you hanging a bit. Still, definitely worth a watch.",1478822400,,313,4.413793103448276

8690364,4,B00Q57MP8C,Found season 2 to be a bit better than season 1.  The show is an entertaining distraction for anyone with and interest in Greek Mythology. There are many violent scenes in this series that are not suitable for children.,1467244800,,219,4.615384615384615
