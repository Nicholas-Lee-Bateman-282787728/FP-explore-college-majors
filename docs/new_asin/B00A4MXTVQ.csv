8546716,5,B00A4MXTVQ,"Alfred Hitchcock's only musical is based on the life of Johan Strauss Junior, his creation of the Blue Danube Waltz, his rivalry with his established parent, and a love triangle between his fiance and a countess interested in more than advancing his career.  Confidently directed and lovingly acted, it is delightful film, coming mid-way in Hitch's UK sound film career.",1478476800,,370,5.166666666666667
8546717,3,B00A4MXTVQ,"This edition (Universal Studios France PAL ASIN:B00A4MXTVQ) also has the complete movie ""Juno and the Paycock"" from 1930, Hitchcock's first all-sound film (Blackmail (1929) was only a silent, with parts later redubbed as a part-talkie.)  There is another French edition of Waltzes From Vienna (ASIN:B000M8NM8W, hint: cheaper if ordered on amazon.fr), also given the French title Le Chant Du Danube like this one, with the same cover picture as this one but without the red border around it;  that one has Hitchcock's silent film Downhill (aka When Boys Leave Home) from 1927.

Waltzes from Vienna is not your usual Hitchcock fare, and Hitch himself hated it, even giving up and walking off the set at one point, but he tried again for a schmaltzy costume drama in Under Capricorn with better success, though Hitchcock hated that one too for some reason (how can you go wrong with Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotton?)  Juno and the Paycock is okay, nothing to sneeze about, but Downhill is excellent Hitchcock, and I think his best silent movie (The Lodger is good, but I hate the happy ending which is contrary to the book).  Hitchcock pulls no punches with Downhill, it's all downhill for the main character from the beginning to almost the end until you can't stand it anymore.  Waltzes From Vienna is pure fluff, and Hitch pulled a kerfluffle with that one.  Nice to pass the time away, but probably only for Hitchcock completists.  Downhill is a great melodrama, the kind Hitchcock always liked to make, even in the sound era, and that he thought he was his best at.",1428537600,,1568,4.824626865671642
