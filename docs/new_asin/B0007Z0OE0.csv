8054431,2,B0007Z0OE0,Unfortunately this DVD was produced in the days of analogue 4:3 screens so the film is presented in a 1.85:1 AR within a 4:3 frame. The transfer and audio are OK but there are no subtitles and no menu so the movie starts playing as soon as you insert the DVD so you miss the start while getting the tim-tams and pop corn.  The AR issue is understandable even if annoying but the other issues are just laziness by York Entertainment.,1406332800,,432,4.333333333333333
8054432,4,B0007Z0OE0,"Steven Gillilan has made a very fine film.  The casting is excellent, and every actor and actress is convincing in his or her part.  I especially thought Tony Sendeas was very good as Nate and Sabrina Gennarino was very concincing as Mattie.  The others were also very good--DeVere Jehl as Max, Jennifer Chudy as Mary Webber, Shelley McPherson as Donna, Nathan Taylor as Ian Webber, and Sophie Radoci as Casey Webber.  The film held my interest from start to finish, and I highly recommend it.",1132531200,,493,4.764705882352941
8054433,4,B0007Z0OE0,"Steve Gillilan, the director, writer and producer of this independent film gem, really shows his talent here. The characters are richly drawn, the narrative is full of twists tht will keep you on the edge of your seat, and one is really drawn into the film as it progresses. I saw this movie at the International Indepentent Film Festival in New York. I went because I had heard that the director had won a prize in LA and because Variety had given it a rave. I was not disappointed. This is a wonderful film, with terrific direction and writing. I think we will be hearing more from this director. His work is fantastic.",1115337600,3,621,4.504424778761062
