8216907,5,B000V6LSZE,"I think that for any film that somehow falls into the realm of ""Exploitation"", my expectations are uniformly low, and many of the films in this particular genre are uniformly bad, and that is sometimes part of their charm I think. I ordered this DVD out of curiosity and because of its reviews.

I have watched it a few times, and I have to say that this film has so many interesting elements to recommend it, I can only call it, ""Wonderful"".

That's just my opinion, and I don't claim to know much about film-making per se, but I was very very impressed, by the performances first of all, but also by the cinematography, and the storyline.

Perhaps also, it seemed so refreshing to see something original.  It seems so much film-making (and music) for the last 40 years has been so derivative (and boring) that it seems creativity is not longer a prerequisite to make a film, etc. BTW, if you are looking just for T&A or a gorefest, this is not the place (no big deal though, that stuff is out there in overwhelming abundance).

This film is not just imaginative, but it has an involving/engaging  continuity and horrible depth of detail and feeling such as you might get in a sweat-soaked malarial dream. The thoughtfully arranged images and scenes flow so naturally, they seem to fall like leaves into a river. Many images are distrubing enough (to me anyway) to really feel like they might be your own as you wake from a nightmare.

This movie is not just ""Boo"" or ""What was that noise?"" or ho-hum, ""I am going to dismember you"", scene-scene-scene -end credits as we see in films today, but this film contains a well-scripted and very well-performed descent into insanity.

It has themes that extend back as far as there have been people. One is that ""Good"" people are those that have power and money and property, no matter how cruel or depraved they might be. Dirty, ""Bad"" people are those that are so pathetic, weak and helpless they have to debase themselves to survive - they are being punished by God for SOME reason, right?

Another key theme is the need to believe in the concept of redemption.

Feeling the characters' depravity, their degradation and pain as the actors walk down the path of the script. Just beautiful.

Redemption here is sought through, and an expression of what a most-pitiable person knows as ""Love"" is made by, acts of revenge and retribution.

As a good film should do, it will evoke in each person their own reaction, so the thoughts and words I have placed here mean little. If this genre interests you I would suggest you see it.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1420070400,,2608,4.5588865096359745

8216909,5,B000V6LSZE,"This is Miyazono at her best!  The other two films in this set are in color and nice B movies with great actiton, but THIS film is practically a film noir, gorgeously lit black and white, gloomy as all get-out, a ""cruel story"" utterly serious in tone. A work of art in addition to the exploitation element.",1387843200,,306,4.368421052631579
8216910,5,B000V6LSZE,"Perhaps, as some of my enemies have no doubt observed, I am a simpleton, but I absolutely love a well-made genre picture like Female Demon Ohyaku.  It has everything that drew me to chambara to begin with - beautiful women, cool fights, and best of all - REVENGE!

The complete title of this film is Legends of the Poisonous Seductress: Female Demon Ohyaku.  In Japanese, the subtitle is Hannya Ohyaku.  Hannya is a famous demonic image used in classical noh theatre and woodblock prints.  Here in the west, most people mistake it as an image of ""the"" devil.  It's actually the personification of the spirit of a vengeful woman.  In this film, it's the face that's tattooed on Ohyaku's back as well as the nature of her role in the story.

And what a story it is!  At the beginning of the film, Ohyaku is revealed to be the child of a prostitute who tries to kill both of them by leaping into a river.  The little girl survives and becomes a con woman and a tightrope walker for a travelling circus.  When a group of ne'er-do-wells taunt her at a performance, a handsome, young ronin named Shinkuro steps in and helps.  Even though Ohyaku can clearly take care of herself, she's impressed with the ronin and soon becomes a part of his plot to steal a gold delivery that's going to the local mint.  It's important to note that Ohyaku is presented as a thief to begin with although her heart of gold shows through when she gives her ill-gotten gains to a single mother who's living on the streets.  Likewise, Shin is stealing in order to punish the corrupt village leaders.  There's definitely a Robin Hood vibe to this pair and they quickly fall in love over the course of a particularly moving scene where they each reveal their own heartaches and agree to trade them with one another.

Of course, they're betrayed and caught when the heist takes place.  Both are tortured by the evil Sengoku and Shin is beheaded right before Ohyaku's eyes.  She's then sent off to a mining camp prison where she begins to plot her revenge.  While there, the wife of the camp's warden takes an interest in Ohyaku and plans to sell her after she's enjoyed her herself.  She's enamored of Ohyaku's pristine skin and uses her back as the canvas for her demonic tattoo masterpiece.

It's important to remember that tattoos are not acceptable in Japanese culture.  Many business establishments ban customers with even a small tattoo.  In Japan, tattoos = yakuza = criminals.  It's a simple equation that would have been obvious to the Japanese viewer in 1968.  That's why it's such a big deal that Ohyaku accepts the full back tattoo of Hannya.  It just shows how far she's willing to go to get her revenge.  And she does go after it with gusto, but to tell you more would spoil the ending.

This film is truly a treasure for those of us who prefer energetic momentum to plot complications.  You know who you are.  It's a rocket ride from beginning to end, with just the right amount of character development to make the protagonists sympathetic.  It's no work of art but it's a well crafted and highly entertaining 90 minutes.

Director Yoshihiro Ishikawa is listed on IMDB as the director of only four films.  In an era when many directors made hundreds of films, this is curious for someone who was so obviously talented.  Apparently, he was about to become a director at Shintoho (literally New Toho) just before it went bankrupt in the early sixties.  He had a hard time joining another studio without a proven track record as director and must have filled the interim years with television duties or below-the-line chores.  I've found very little information regarding his work but I'm glad this gem still exists.

As to star Junko Miyazono, she appeared in 22 titles between 1958 and 1969.  She was only 26 years old in 1969 so I can only imagine that she chose to leave acting.  Like Ishikawa, there's very little info about her floating around the internet.  If you're privy to more, please let me know.  I found her beautiful and engaging here and I very much look forward to her appearances in the subsequent Ohyaku films.

The only person in the cast to go on to great notoriety is Tomisaburu Wakayama.  Besides being the brother of Zatoichi star, Shintaro Katsu, Wakayama went on to great fame as Ogami Itto in the Lone Wolf and Cub films and TV series.  He was also featured in a couple of Sleepy Eyes of Death pictures and the Ridley Scott film, Black Rain.  All told, he was in almost 150 projects.  His turn here is short but he's convincing as the benevolent oyabun who helps the unlucky couple.

The music is fairly typical fare but the sound design is a standout here.  I especially liked how the impending thunderstorm is used to heighten the action during Ohyaku's prison escape.

If you like fun, explosive, sexy action, then this is the chanbara film for you.  Very highly recommended.",1378684800,,4888,4.607184241019699
8216911,3,B000V6LSZE,"The first of the series with the intriguing titles starring the undeniably attractive Junko Miyazono, and probably the best of the three. The story here seems a little less predictable than in the two sequels, and therefore stays a little bit more interesting.
Junko Miyazono's swordplay is slow and cumbersome, and the camerawork barely helps it at all. Don't get your hopes up: The sequels are worse, the third part being just a complete waste of time. There are large numbers of excellent Japanese movies around, so keep shopping.",1282953600,2,533,5.0
8216912,5,B000V6LSZE,This film is part one of the Legends Of The Poisonous Seductress trilogy. The action and lesbian love scenes were excellent. I especially like the part when Ohyaku beheaded her tormentor.,1235692800,,187,5.064516129032258
8216913,5,B000V6LSZE,"The first thing that surprised me about this flick is that it is in black and white.  Obviously, I could have read that from the product description, but I just sort of passed over it and seeing that vivid color cover I was expecting something different.  Not that this is anyway a bad thing.  There is something unexpected about a sexual and violent black and white film that makes them all the more stunning, just because I am not used to seeing such extremes in the classic format.

""Female Demon Ohyaku"" (""Yen dokufuden hannya no ohyaku"") is just a fantastic flick.  The first Pinky Violence film, and the one that would inspire many other rape/revenge flicks like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-Snowblood/dp/B0001I54U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady Snowblood</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B001BR5F4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>&nbsp;it has all the classic elements.  Ohyaku Dayu (Miyazono Junko) is a beautiful acrobat/prostitute who is sold to the highest bidder following each show.  Capturing the eye of a handsome thief, he rescues her from a bureaucratic rapist and claims her for his own.  She is just the bad girl a guy like him needs as partner and wife.  Ah, but a happy life was not meant for Ohyaku, and she soon finds her self without a lover, disgraced and exiled on a prison island.  There is only one thing for a desperate gal in that situation....revenge.

Now, being an older flick ""Female Demon Ohyaku"" is not as extreme as some of the later Pinky Violence offerings.  There is no real nudity to speak of, and the gore is limited.  But they make do with what they have, as Ohyaku seduces and kills her way through a number of hapless men, and even one woman (very sexy scene!), working her way towards her target.  Lead actress Miyazono Junko is quite the beauty, although believable tough and deadly as well.  She doesn't let anyone take the easy way out in her revenge, but gets creative with her cruelty. Wakayama Tomisaburo, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lone-Wolf-and-Cub/dp/B000AYNFVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lone Wolf and Cub</a>&nbsp;fame, plays a supporting role but never really gets into the action.

The DVD has some great features as well, including an essay on the Sword and Girl genre, and a nice commentary.  The cover is reversible so you can have the original Japanese artwork instead of the shown cover, which is really cool.  This is followed by two other loosely-connected color films in the series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legends-of-the-Poisonous-Seductress-2-Quick-Draw-Okatsu/dp/B000V6LSZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legends of the Poisonous Seductress #2: Quick Draw Okatsu</a>.  and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legends-of-the-Poisonous-Seductress-3-Okatsu-the-Fugitive/dp/B000V6LSZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legends of the Poisonous Seductress #3: Okatsu the Fugitive</a>. They don't continue the story, but feature the same lead actress and themes.  I am anxious to pick them up, and see if they are as magnificent as this gem.",1217894400,13,3263,6.241071428571429

The part I didn't enjoy was having the disk stopping on me after a few minutes in the movie and I had to keep trying to get past the section it would stop on.",1212883200,,300,3.966666666666667
