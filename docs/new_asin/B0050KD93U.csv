4514895,5,B0050KD93U,"Very well done. It was nice to hear the reflections of friends and family who knew her personally. It didn't come across as her friends trying to capitalize on her, or telling tales out of school. It was and honest account told by people who knew her best.",1409011200,,256,4.354166666666667
4514896,3,B0050KD93U,"This film was interesting, but did not provide any new information on Princess Grace of Monaco for me.",1406937600,,102,4.722222222222222
4514897,5,B0050KD93U,"If you are a Princess Grace follower and fan, this is an interesting peek into an aspect of her life; Grace as mother  - and the often fraught mother/daughter relationship that many families experience - even ones with Princesses!  It sheds further light on the unseen pressures churning in Grace's life  - just below that perfect surface-  that remained ""glossed over"" for the sake of royal decorum and high society ""appearances"".  And, one can begin to imagine the stress that was building up that led to her untimely death.  I recall seeing the total shock and  deep grief in Prince Ranier , Prince Albert and Princess Caroline's faces at her funeral - which reflected our own sorrow -  as they faced her sudden and violent departure from their lives.  Only, it seemed to me that, unlike those of us who had always treasured her, they were just beginning to realize the depth of their loss and how much they truly loved and needed her  - simply as a beloved wife and a dear Mom. It also captures the amazing way that she always managed to juggle and carry out her simultaneously demanding roles as monarch, wife and mother -  all in the very public eye -so seemlessly, and always with elegance, warmth and , the epitome of grace.",1402185600,2,1232,4.605504587155964
4514898,4,B0050KD93U,"This is an interesting movie about beautiful real-life princesses, Grace, Caroline, and Stephanie.  Anyone who is a fan of Grace Kelly of Hollywood would love seeing the story of her transformation from actress to princess.",1388016000,,223,5.371428571428571
4514899,3,B0050KD93U,"If you want to know more about Grace Kelly and her daughters, this will be useful.  It is not highly entertaining, but documentaries are not made for that.  The principal focus is on Grace and then on her daughters.  One part shows the section of the road where Grace was killed in the accident, but any gruesome materials are avoided.  The two daughters are shown and interviewed in considerable candor.",1376956800,2,404,4.728571428571429
