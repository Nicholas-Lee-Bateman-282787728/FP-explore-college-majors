8730135,5,B014A8PMUU,A very good double DVD set and excellent value if you don't have the 50 X 4 DVD - which does not appear to be available on Amazon as a stand alone disc.. Both DVDs are very entertaining and informative and this item should be purchased by anyone who love this group. Lots of footage and music included too and plenty of interviews to boot.,1451692800,6,339,4.230769230769231
8730136,5,B014A8PMUU,CSNY at their live best. There's nothing better than this DVD from one of America's supergroups.,1448064000,6,96,5.0625
8730137,1,B014A8PMUU,"This is a total rip-off!  It consists of two dvds (not very good ones, either) previously-released under their own titles, now repackaged under this new one.  The previous titles are : ""CSNY: Fifty By Four""; and ""Neil Young's Music Box"".  No where, in the marketing of this release, are you told this.  Dishonest and disgraceful.  Be warned!",1448064000,20,341,4.912280701754386
8730138,3,B014A8PMUU,"the CSNY 50x4 came in a bluray case and the Neil Young interviews in a dvd case, so different sizes in the thin cardboard box.  The CSNY 50x4 was 2:45 and contained short clips of the usual Buffalo Springfield at Monterey Pop, Journey through the Past, Woodstock, Dick Cavett Woodstock show, C&N on BBCTV, Wembley 74 concert., etc.  I enjoyed very much the fairly lengthy interviews with Dallas Taylor, Greg Reeves, Calvin Samuels, Bill Halvorsen, The Albert Brothers, Joe Lala, Chad Cromwell, Mike Finnegan.  Also a B&W Manassas interview with Stills and Taylor.  Also short interview clips of C,S,N,Y.  The Neil dvd was 2:05 - 8 interviews with no info as to date, interviewer, etc. checking Youtube the first was a 1992 interview with Tim Roth (36:00),  a CBC interview with Neil and Daniel Lanois that also goes over 30 mins. a Raw and Uncut Bluenotes interview about half as long as the 56 min version on youtube, a short clip from Charlie Rose talking about comparisons with Dylan, A 1982 interview at his ranch for French TV. A 1985 NZ interview - longer version on youtube.  Would recommend the CSNY to hadrcore fans because of the interviews.  The Neil dvd I do not care for so much",1447545600,12,1191,4.6923076923076925
8730139,1,B014A8PMUU,"This is a joke.. All they did was put the CSNY (fifty by four) DVD and some random Neil young DVD together and called it a ""release"". What a joke. As soon as I opened the package and saw the two DVDs I immediately requested a return. On the back of both DVDs it says ""not sanctioned by artists"", very upset and disappointed. Buy Long Time Coming.. That is a amazing DVD and stay away from this.",1447459200,9,394,4.12987012987013
