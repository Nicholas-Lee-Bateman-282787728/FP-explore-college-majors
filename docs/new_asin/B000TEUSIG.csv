8208812,5,B000TEUSIG,"Didn't watch all of the movies but I let my mother watch them all even though she didn't want to see them because she's a stick in the mud. Bought it for 'Savage Dawn' because of Lance Henriksen and his blonde hair back then. Man, he's cool.
Everyone should buy a copy, even if it's just to see Lance. Yeah",1423526400,,306,4.116666666666666

8208816,3,B000TEUSIG,"While I really enjoyed all three movies, this is really a pretty inexcusable collection. I cannot believe a company like Image would actually release szoemthing like this.

We start with Caged Fury which seems to not have a beginning! It looks like someone took the version they taped off HBO late at night in the 80's and burned it to disc. The problem is their timer must have went off late (or their VCR ate the beginning of their tape) because there's no beginning! They throw up a quick cheaply made title card and dive right into the middle of the movie.

The movie is silly but fun garbage about a girl who runs off to become a star and (of course) gets sold into sex slavery through a bogus court and a bogus prison. Fortunately her sister gets into the jail to save the day.

Lots of boobs and funny dialouge mixed with insanely improbable action, so you get what you came for, but the quality (tape glitches galore) is shockingly bad.

On to ""Drug Traffikers"". The first thing you'll be struck by is that this film is not called ""Drug Traffikers"" (perhaps that explains the mis-spelling) nor does it have anything to do with drugs. It's a legendary straight-to-video cheapie called ""Thunder Warrior."" Andin the opening credits that what it says - there isn't even a graphic over the title with the new name.

""Thunder Warrior"" was a pretty successful rental - so much so there was a sequel. A straight to video rehash of ""First Blood"" only with Rambo as a Native American. Of course the rednecks harass him and his family and OF COURSE he blows up the whole town.

It's silly, but just what you want when you buy a set like this. Of course you want something that's properly mastered and not a blurry old VHS put onto disc.

Finally we come to ""Savage Dawn."" Lance Henriksen is an all-around bad ass on a motorcycle who keeps agitating a rampaging gang in the small town his wheelchair-bound buddy (George Kennedy) lives in. Much violence ensues.

""Savage Dawn"" is a cool flick and probably at least looks the best of the three, but it is pretty obviously a burn of the old Media Home Video version (I think it cuts off before the credits even finish!).

I don't know who oversees quality control at Image, but this is pretty bad. I love that movies like this are coming to DVD but I hate that this is the best we can expect them to look.

No extras - you're lucky you get the movies in (mostly) complete form!",1250035200,8,2420,4.45475113122172
8208817,3,B000TEUSIG,"The main reason I bought this DVD was for the movie Thunder Warrior. A great (Spaghetti Western  Style) action movie about a man pushed to his limits! It is very much like Rambo except for the fact that it is a low-budget production. Mark Gregory plays Thunder and also stars in some other great cult films like Bronx Warriors 1990, Escape from the Bronx, Thunder Warrior 1 & 2, War Bus Commando. There is plenty of action, car chases and explosions! The voices are dubbed but I think that makes movie even better, like an old Bruce Lee flick! The quality of this film isn't the best picture quality but the only copy availible on DVD I have found.",1231804800,4,648,4.445378151260504
8208818,1,B000TEUSIG,I didn't find these three movies very entertaining. I was a little dissapointed. I wouldn't recommend anyone to by this collection.,1228089600,,131,5.285714285714286
