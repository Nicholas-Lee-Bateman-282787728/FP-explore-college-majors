8293431,5,B001DIA7GK,"Short and simple explanation of America's failed attempt at communism.  Makes it clear for those students that just don't seem to ""get it""",1408320000,,138,5.0
8293432,4,B001DIA7GK,"Today's students need to learn ""The Lesson of 1623,"" which is the sub-title of the film, ""Yours and Mine.""  The Pilgrims have been much maligned going back to Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter.  As ""Yours and Mine"" points out, they were not dour dopes dressed in drab black clothing.  And, more importantly, neither were they colorless collectivists--at least not once they soon realized the folly of not maintaining private property rights.

If an educator wants a way to teach his students that private property rights promote the good of society as a whole as well as that of the individual, ""Yours and Mine:  The Lesson of 1623"" is a great means to that end, using the context of American history to do so.  Those familiar with izzit Current, the producer's current event service, know it as I do as a wonderful resource for promoting critical thinking about economics and liberty.  So be sure to visit the producer's site for helpful lesson plans and other resources to help you drive home this and similar free-market lessons to your student.",1318809600,,1055,4.893258426966292
