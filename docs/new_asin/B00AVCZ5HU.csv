8558062,1,B00AVCZ5HU,Poor sound quality and rather boring. True it is supposably factual but not worth the rental fee.,1436572800,,97,4.764705882352941
8558063,4,B00AVCZ5HU,"Very interesting and I would have to say most probable.  Unfortunately the sound quality is not great. It's not a professionally done film but rather a taped seminar.  That being said, it answered our questions as to what the heck went down at Roswell in a reasonable way with evidence to back it up. Well worth the 99 cents.",1428105600,,325,4.491525423728813
8558064,4,B00AVCZ5HU,"The crash at Roswell of ""something"" in 1947 was a unparalleled event in the UFO movement. The official explanation by the Air Force that it was a weather balloon has been laughable from its inception.  This makes those who believe it was a real spaceship with real aliens more credible, at least to themselves.  Other theories abound and the whole thing has resulted in a profit-making industry.  But somewhere there is truth and I think Guy Malone is on to something.

Malone is the co-founder of Alien Resistance, an organization that seeks to interpret the world of UFO's and all that is related to it in a credible manner.  He lived in Roswell, NM for about a decade and is familiar with all the groups that are based there or converge there yearly.  I have enjoyed listening via dvd to the varied speakers from conferences Alien Resistance has sponsored.

Three major topics are discussed in this dvd: the craft and its origin, the occupants and the material of the craft.  The origin of the craft is found in Germany and the history and documentation that is presented is fascinating.  The occupants of the craft - this is awful to even think about.  I'll leave it to Malone to reveal and it breaks his heart too.  With regard to the material of the craft discussion centers around Nitinol, or Nickel Titanium aka ""magic memory metal.""

Though well documented, I think this is one of Malone's more speculative works and does not represent the information that is closer to his heart.  He is more about what you would find at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-Aliens-Demons-Evidences-For-A-Spiritual-View/dp/B00AVCZ4LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are Aliens Demons? Evidences For A Spiritual View</a>.

I would give this five stars for content.  I'm giving it four because my copy has some background noise near the end.  I don't know if it is just my copy or if it is a production problem.",1360972800,,1939,5.0886075949367084
