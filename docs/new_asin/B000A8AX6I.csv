2379508,2,B000A8AX6I,"I am playing ""His Girl Friday"" now on a very high end DVD player, and the quality of the image is horrific.  It is much lower resolution than the original film.  The contrast is much too high.  The sound quality is poor.  This looks and plays like a cheap Chinese copy of a low quality source.",1346716800,41,293,4.178571428571429

2379511,5,B000A8AX6I,They don't make movies like these anymore.  Cary Grant was one of a kind and the supreme actor.  None of his movies have ever disappointed me.  I love His Girl Friday and Penny Serenade.  You can't go wrong with a Grant movie.,1312848000,11,226,4.309523809523809

Includes ""The Amazing Adventure"" (1936), ""His Girl Friday"" (1940), ""Penny Seranade"" (1941) and the widescreen edition of ""Charade"" (1963). Over 6 1/2 hours playing time.

2379516,5,B000A8AX6I,Great collection of movies. I remember watching these with my parents when they came out on TV.  It's been long awhile since I've seen Penny Serenade and the Great Amazing Adventure and forgot how good they were. Charade was just as suspenseful and thrilling as if seeing it for the first time and His Girl Friday just as fun and laugh filled from beginning to end. Thumbs up to Cary Grant and these four movies.,1382140800,2,412,4.493333333333333

2379519,2,B000A8AX6I,"Yeah, the films are there, but the quality is so poor that I have no desire to watch them. Save your cash for a better set from a reputable source like TCM!",1365379200,55,156,3.90625

2379523,5,B000A8AX6I,"Short, but wonderful early Cary Grant.  A bit comedy, and a bit morality play stressing the authenticity of natural beauty.  Young Edward Everett Horten in the role of a man who just wanted the wife he fell in love with.",1352332800,,220,4.475
2379524,5,B000A8AX6I,Cary Grant is hands-down one of our best actors and it's good to have a collection of his movies in my collection. I might even do a Cary Grant film festival one of these weekends when the snow is piling up outside and I have warm popcorn and cold beer to see me through.,1350345600,,271,4.037037037037037
2379525,1,B000A8AX6I,"This box is marked ""Collector's Edition,""  and the description the box says ""fully restored and enhanced digital masters.""  What a crock!

This version is an insult both to Cary Grant and his fans.  The only thing worth keeping is the picture of Cary Grant on the front of the box.  The quality of the movies is atrocious.  Not only do they look worse than anything I have ever seen on something taped from television on an inferior VHS recorder, but the picture is cropped on the sides.  It is a real thrill to see the cast listings starting with ""ary Grant,"" followed by ""ss ???'s wardrobe . . .""

If anyone at Amazon reads this, I would suggest that they stop offering this item.  It can only hurt their reputation.",1348531200,141,718,4.461538461538462
8076195,3,B000A8AX6I,"If I'm not mistaken all of this are in the public domain including Charade (which is one of my favorite movies). So, unless you are paying for and getting quality watch it for free.",1483056000,,181,4.352941176470588
