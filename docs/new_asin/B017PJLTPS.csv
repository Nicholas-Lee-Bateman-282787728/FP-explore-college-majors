8739998,5,B017PJLTPS,"Three of these are where I live.  I love movies that were made to entertain an audience.  And there is no filth, no sex, and profanity is not heard.  In today's market, I doubt if people would have purchased tickets to go to the movie to be entertained.  Totally Enjoyable!
  The later movies made for tv series are the same as far as filth, sex and profanity, but the plots are difficult to follow, in that the audience is invited to get involved with the solving of the plot.  Complex plot lines do not make for entertainment, IMHO.  The movies are still good, but aren't as easy to watch .  They are still very good, and I would recommend to any one who enjoys movies of the mid 30s to late 40s.",1487462400,2,698,4.2272727272727275
