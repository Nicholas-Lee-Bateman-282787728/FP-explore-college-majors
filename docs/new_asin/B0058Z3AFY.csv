The woman is a high end business woman while the young man makes clay pottery and toys for kids at the hospital.. the couple gets married in this outing but the woman dies when someone tries to take her purse.. She falls and takes a blow to the head..

I think this is one of the best movies I saw in a long time... The effects are a step up from the US version.. The ending is a twist in itself....,1494374400,,632,4.023809523809524

8462574,5,B0058Z3AFY,"Ghost is a Japanese remake of the 1990 box office hit of the same title. While it took many plot elements of the American original especially the lovemaking pottery scene while the song Unchained Melody is being played in the background,the changes made were definitely a good update for the 21st century audience. The female partner - Nanami - now was the one killed and who arises as a ghost to offer protection for her lover,Jun-ho. Also worth mentioning are: romance has become the centerpoint of the story instead of adding numerous genres for commercial purposes;the psychic is not given too much scenes to shine for the couple to dominate the story; a ghost child in the hospital teaches Nanami activities which made it heartwarming as the latter did not experience being a mother while alive; and finally having Nanami and Jun-ho meet each other while the latter is in coma at the conclusion made it more touching instead on relying too much on supernatural to show their love for each other. Overall,it was a good up-to-date remake that many viewers will surely enjoy",1411257600,,1076,4.853260869565218
8462575,5,B0058Z3AFY,I WAS SO TAKEN BACK WITH THIS FILM.  I ABSOLUTELY ENJOYED IT TO THE FULLEST.,1405468800,,76,4.066666666666666
8462576,5,B0058Z3AFY,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS! I stumbled across this on You Tube and I just had to find an original copy of this. I won't spoil anything for anybody who may be interested, but I will say that the protagonist in this one is a lady. Naturally there are some cultural interjections, but nothing that takes away from the movie. On the contrary, this entire experience is quite wonderful, and stays true to the premise of the original. I highly recommend it!",1402444800,,448,4.54320987654321
8462577,5,B0058Z3AFY,"Sometimes a remake is better than the original. The original GHOST with Patrick Swayze was remade in 2010 with Seung-Heon Song in the starring role as Juno Kim, a Korean born potter now living in Japan. Mr. Song has made a career of playing the romantic lead and he is supremely well cast as one who quite unexpectedly meets a Japanese business executive who takes one look at his rugged good looks and the audience can nearly hear the twang ring in her mind. Their chemistry is immediate and palpable. They marry and are happy until his wife is killed in a motorcycle accident. She becomes a ghost and the movie morphs from romance to fantasy. There are inevitable plot twists and complications with the surprising re-appearance of one of the wife's business partners with a hidden agenda. In an over the top performance is an elderly Japanese psychic who can ""hear"" the ghost and communicates with the husband in a spirit-within-a-body scene that is both sentimental and touching. How one takes all this in is a function of whether one can appreciate fantasies that remain rooted in the human condition. GHOST manages to tread a gentle balancing act between crying at key scenes and commiserating at others.  GHOST is I think a date movie that can cause lovers to ponder their own relationship even after the closing credits.",1396137600,,1327,4.794759825327511
8462578,5,B0058Z3AFY,"I have seen the American movie that this movie was a remake for; most of us Americans alive at the time it came out have.  But I have to be honest and say this one was the best of the two.  It was more sensitively done; you could really have empathy with the characters.  My wife felt the same way.  In fact, not only we two, but many others (see the Amazon reviews) feel the same way about the two movies.  It's up to you to decide, but I think you'll feel you have gone through a very nice experience watching this movie.  Happy watching!",1391385600,,540,4.095238095238095
8462579,5,B0058Z3AFY,"How apropos for a title and the twist in the story line.  I had my doubts, but both the screenwriter and director of this movie took what is now an American classic movie and made an enjoyable remake.  I loved the reversed roles in the characters in the story,  There is  a cohesiveness in the story and just enough suspense to keep you glued to you seat..  The casting director should also receive recognition in picking the right actors for the specific roles.  It is always a pleasure to have Song Seung Heon  in the male leading role.  TThis movie although sad is somewhat uplifting in the end.",1371427200,2,598,4.472222222222222
8462580,5,B0058Z3AFY,"I think this movie was written for Japanese television, but that does not take away from the enjoyment I had watching this movie. If you saw Ghost with Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze, this is the Japanese version. Don't let the American version affect your enjoyment of this Japanese version or you will not like this movie! Keep an open mind, like you are seeing a new movie for the first time and don't try to compare the two and you will enjoy it more!

It is funny, it is romantic, it is mystical. I love the characters in this movie! They are based on the American movie, but they are unique, too (so don't try to compare).

I give this movie 5 stars for the fun and enjoyment that this movie brings.",1363219200,3,704,4.285714285714286
