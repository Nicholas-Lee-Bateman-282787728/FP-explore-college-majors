3162873,4,B0016PWWRC,"""Mighty Machines"" 4-DVD set is just what we needed for those rainy spring days when 'outside' just isn't going to happen.  I bought these for my almost-three year old grandson, and Mom says they're a hit.  An earlier reviewer was disappointed because they didn't include letters or numbers or other 'educational' enhancements.  So what's wrong with FUN???",1240185600,2,355,5.192982456140351
3162874,5,B0016PWWRC,"As an adult, I find all the Mighty Machines dvds a little bit cheesy.  But, both my 5 year old and my 2 year old, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these dvds!  And their opinion is the one that matters, right?  The Power Pack is a great buy, but even individually, each one is priced very inexpensive, especially when compared to other children's series.  We have watched them all many times over, and my children continue to ask specifically for ""mighty machines""!",1234483200,7,449,4.575
3162875,2,B0016PWWRC,"Not formatted for big screen TVs so images are distorted.  The four DVDs are boring.  There is excessive detail without meaningful information.  For example: Getting a race car ready: hand remove nuts, deflate tire, remove from rim, check tire, tire good so return to rim,etc.  Does not explain why or how the tire is checked or what made it good enough to put back on. It would be OK to sacrifice action if there were some interesting and true information being given.  We have some old big machine VHS tapes that are very action packed and give some relevent information without being boring.  I wish I could find something like that in on a DVD.",1232841600,2,648,4.591304347826087
3162876,5,B0016PWWRC,I have a two year old who loves these DVD's.  He actually watches it and gets excited as the machines move around and work.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has children and like to watch trucks.  Much better than cartoons and a lot less annoying.,1230681600,13,259,4.354166666666667

3163124,3,B0016PWWRC,"This is my 3.5 year old's very favorite show. We really enjoy it and the other reviewers have touched on the quality of the show itself.

My comments are about the DVDs. We were first exposed to the show through Netflix and watched it there until it abruptly disappeared from streaming. Amazon to the rescue and we ordered them. The play quality is fine so from that angle, these are 5 stars.

A few things: Because the logo was different and this doesn't detail episode names, I wasn't sure that I was ordering the same show. It is. It's the cute Canadian show with the intro song, ""Mighty Machines, big and Mighty Machines, working for you doing mighty things, Mighty Machines!"" If your son is like mine, the song is as much a part of the appeal as the show itself. So one thing I was disappointed in is the episodes don't have the song in the opening or the credits. This disappointed my son.

There is no indication for which episode is on which disc, as they've grouped them into categories. If your child knows episodes by name, print out the list provided by the reviewer below and keep them in it with your discs so you know which episode is on which disc. I think this was an oversight by the company.

Another annoying feature is that the discs have mandatory previews that can't be skipped through because they have disabled menu access. This is unnecessary.

The menu is stilted. There are 3-4 episodes listed and then a section of ""Bonus Episodes."" They're not actually bonus--that's just how you access all the episodes you paid for.

The company also doesn't make it easy to determine if you're getting all the episodes or if you're overlapping with such generic names as ""Mega Pack"" and ""Super Pack.""  If you order ""Mega Pack,"" ""Super Pack,"" and ""Power Pack,"" you get all 39 episodes with no overlap. If you order any of the other titles (like ""Lights and Ladders""--those are names of individual discs contained within the ""Packs."" However, there is no overlap of episodes from disc to disc so if you order individual discs and no packs, you shouldn't have any duplicates.",1415059200,26,2088,4.611859838274933

It's not a cartoon, the camera follows REAL ""big wheels"" doing REAL jobs. Each truck provides it's own commentary in its own voice (which, admittedly, for adults can seem cheesy at times) and teaches all about the functions of the vehicle.

3163133,1,B0016PWWRC,I've never seen more boring children's dvd's! I thought there were songs to go along with the machines. But each dvd is nararrated by a very monotone (boring voice).

They do voice overs for each of the trucks and give them names... Pretty cheesy!  I guess that's their way of making kids pay attention to what they are actually doing.  Overall, my son liked it but wasn't crazy about it but I guess it gets the job done of a video showing construction trucks doing what they do.",1403395200,,460,4.252873563218391

3163157,5,B0016PWWRC,"This is a fantastic 4-pack of DVDs. They have a very decent run time, over an hour, and you do have the option to 'Play All,' which I love. That way on each DVD it will play all the shows without me having to stop what I'm doing to click on the next title or episode. They also automatically start the first show after a few minutes at the menu if you don't select something. Another nice feature.  Keeps my boys entertained, while getting educated, for hours when I need to get things done around the house. I even find myself (and my husband for that matter) stopping to watch as well since they are so interesting. Great to take in my laptop on the airplane when we travel. My kids ask for it my name now...""Mighty Machines!""
Here is the list of shows on each DVD in the set. I actually wrote these titles with a marker on the DVD so when my son wanted to watch the Building Demolition or Garbage Trucks, I could tell which DVD that episode was on easily. The episode titles are fairly simple to figure out what the show is about...

#1. ""Roadways to Runways DVD"" (Blue DVD) :: Play All, At the Race Track, At the Airport, On the Road, Bonus Episodes (Picking Up the Garbage, The Fire Trucks, Building a Skyscraper, After the Blast. All Bonus Episodes are 3+ minutes each)
#2. ""Lights & Ladders DVD"" (Red DVD) :: Play All, At the Firehall, In the City, At the Garbage Dump, Bonus Episodes (Towers Tumbling Down, At the Construction Site, At the Demolition Site, At the Rock Quarry)
#3. ""Boats to the Rescue!"" (Orange DVD):: Play All, To the Rescue, Making Waves, In the Harbor, Bonus Episodes (Cement Truck at Work, the Truck Engine Line, Truck Cab Assembly, Sky-High Concrete Pumper)
#4. ""Diggers & Dozers"" (Gray DVD) :: Play All, At the Construction Site, At the Demolition Site, At the Rock Quarry, Bonus Episodes (The Fire Trucks, In the City, At the Garbage Dump, At the Firehall)

Some of these 'bonus episodes' are little snippits of what's on the other DVDs as you can see.

Final Tip - Buy these as birthday presents for all your friends' kids and the kids will love you and the mom's will love you even more. Nothing better than a gift that gives mom some 'time' to get things done and teaches the kids something along the way. Just think the 'Hot off the Press' episode, which is about making newspapers. That might be obsolete one day and your child will have known was a newspaper was! Better than buying more toys for kids in my opinion!

Every young boy should own a copy of this and the ""Mighty Machines Super Pack"" which I purchased as well.",1401840000,,2561,4.4173728813559325

Kind of like a personal tour of the construction site, the race track, the airport, and on and on. Well made and kid friendly language.

The only criticism I can really make is that the video is now rather old. I think it dates to the mid 1990s, and was recorded on so-so video equipment. Thus, the video quality is a bit less than what you expect from a typical DVD. For the cost, it's a minor nit.",1368489600,,548,4.591836734693878

This series is so simple, does not use cuddly animals or cartoons, and yet he is absorbed again and again.  He especially loves the Giant Tow Truck one from season 3.  I have been sucked into them as well.  They are very neat and his verbalization has shot up significantly since he started watching them.

3163308,5,B0016PWWRC,"If you are a parent who is hesitant to even let your young one watch TV--then this is a great program.  I come from the camp of major distrust of TV viewing for young children.  I am not so strict to follow the ""absolutely no TV"" extremists--but i do limit TV/Video watching significantly compared to most American households (we don't even have a tv).  Mighty Machines is one of two television programs i let my almost 2 year old watch.  He started watching at about 18 months when he showed an interests in cars, trucks, construction vehicles etc, by chance at his aunt's house as she was flipping through the kiddie stations.  (This is totally a show that he himself selected and cannot get enough of watching--even if it is a rerun) Now that he is rarely at his aunt's house anymore i am compelled to come here and buy as many as i can for his collection to watch one episode every couple of days or so.

Why i like this program:  As a media person/producer myself, i know the tricks, tropes, and concepts behind how programs are created, produced etc.  I sincerely believe that the manipulation of time and space through editing can be confusing to a little person who is trying to figure out how the world works.  i also believe (as backed by scientific studies--just read the new one about sponge bob) that it contributes to short attentions spans and our fast-food/microwave culture in general with the fast cutting and leaving out the ""in between"" of a process.  Animations/cartoons/puppets/talking animals are products of an adult imagination--not a child's.  That sort of creativity/fantasy imagination doesn't begin until much later in humans.  New humans are fascinated with the real:  nature, how the world works, etc.

Mighty Machines is documentary in nature.  It is only 20 mins long and tries as much as possible to show all the steps in a process to really allow young minds to grasp and understand the workings of these different machines.  The takes are long and slow.  There are few jump cuts and there is minimal talking and music.  It really allows a young person to get into the process of how the world works and choose what he or she may want to focus on within the scene.  My little one DOES like going to a construction site and watching the machines.  He has a great attention span as evidenced by his ability to play independently and imaginatively without adult direction fr substantial periods of time.  So, to watch Mighty Machines is as close to being in person/on-site where the machines of our world work everyday.  He can also recognize and has started to differentiate between the different construction vehicles, cars, trucks, etc because of a combination of his books, toys, real life encounters, and Mighty Machines.

(As a note, even all of the adults who sit down and watch the program with him, myself included, are fascinated with the topics of the program--i never have had the thought or interest to want to know how salt makes it to my table from the mine--but now i know and it was fascinating to watch something that i take for granted that happens in the world every day)

It may take some getting used to for children who are used to being dazzled and entertained by hyper-color, fast paced, manic children programs.  But it is never too late to detox your child from this detrimental programing--all one has to do is start by turning OFF the TV--not even allowing them to watch Mighty Machines, and promoting and facilitating independent play.  Then when the time is right balance it all out by adding quality programs such as this one into their worlds.

Great place to look for advice on how:  Magda Gerber and her RIE philosophies (Your Self-Confident Baby) and janetlansbury dot com.",1321833600,2,3741,4.722650231124807

3163324,5,B0016PWWRC,"My son is pretty much obsessed with machines.  He just turned three and has had this 4 pack for quite some time now. The company sent it to us to replace a dvd that wouldn't work on our new dvd player.  (Shows how wonderful the company's customer service is, too, since we'd purchased the dvd at ToysRUs.)  I don't have any idea why there are bad reviews on this product.  I am not the type of mother who sits her kids down in front of the tv each day and lets them vegetate. They rarely, if ever, get to watch anything that doesn't have educational value, and I try to limit tv time to 30 minutes a day.
Since we purchased the first dvd, he's been singing the mighty machines them song and asks to watch the videos at least once a day.  If he can't watch the video he wants me to read machine books to him (about boats, cars, trucks, trains, anything that has an engine/motor in it) or he wants to play with his own machines.  Don't get me wrong, he loves a lot of other things, like music, books, drawing, etc... but he really wants to learn about machines, how they work and what their jobs are.  I think it's a very good interest and these dvds are very educational as well as entertaining. I even like to sit and watch once in awhile.
Even my 18 month old sits and watches sometimes.
If your boy or girl loves machines, these dvds will be a huge hit in your house.  I'd recommend any of the Mighty Machines series.",1300924800,,1419,4.1911764705882355

The narration is told from the point of view of the diggers, fire trucks, race cars, etc. which is really neat.  I have since bought it as a gift for 2 other children.  I definitely recommend the Mighty Machines DVDs and plan to buy my son more in the future.",1293580800,,481,4.021052631578947
3163327,5,B0016PWWRC,"My 2 year old son is obsessed with fire trucks, bulldozers, garbage trucks, you name it. He loves watching these DVDs. So much so, that he's now figured out how to work the DVD player by himself so he can play these whenever he wants to. Parents will no doubt love the opening theme song, it really has the ability to stick in your head. All. Day. Long. And we find we can really relate to some of the lyrics, like ""Mighty machines. You can watch them all day and never know why. Mighty machines."" (I think that's what he's singing.) One can only assume the producers knew they were making a quality product that kids will demand to watch over and over and over again.

The price is great, the quality is pretty good, and the narrators are kinda funny when they act out the voices of the various trucks/ cars/ mighty machines. You get four dvds to choose from so you can rotate them out without going completely bonkers watching the same DVD day in and day out. As a parent of a toddler going through the terrible two's, I don't think we could survive without this DVD set.",1292371200,,1073,4.338308457711443

3163331,5,B0016PWWRC,"I have not yet purchased this dvd set, and nor did I purchase the first Mighty Machines video that we have now, but from how my son reacts to the video we have now, this set is like.. a God sent.
My son will wake up first thing in the morning, grab his milk, sit down and watch his mighty machines video for half an hour, while we wakes up (which is perfect, because he wakes up at 5-5:30 and that's too early for me)
He loves the video we have, and it works great for long trips. The voice overs for the trucks a cheesy, but hello, they are made for kids!
My son loves the video so much (he remember some of the tractors from the video) we were at my husbands job and he saw a tractor and said ""Mighty!"" He's only 18 months... so he's not talking too much, but he has learned a lot of words from this ""mighty machines"" series!

Mighty Machines, with its slower pace, and interesting (albeit cheesy) characters my son will actually sit and watch the DVD, giving him some much needed down time whenever he starts to get a little manic. It is not documentary and doesn't go into much detail on how or why things work, just leisurely paced video of big machines in action. After watching the DVD's he will often playing nicely with his toy trucks and repeat things he's seen or heard on the DVD.

The series is especially good if you are looking to stay away from fast cut videos that has been associated with the lack of attention span in children.  Typical scenes pan slowly through the details and talks through each thing that happens.  You feel like you are actually taking a leisurely field trip to the site.

It was a perfect stocking stuffer.",1248652800,,326,3.878787878787879
3163353,1,B0016PWWRC,"I'm at a loss as to how anyone, kids or adults, can find any entertainment value in this series of DVDs.  Based on the positive reviews, I purchased this 4-pack.  My 4 year old and 2.5 year old voted to watch ""Diggers"" first.  After 15 minutes, my 4 year old was asking for a new movie.  We sat through another 15 minutes, and I finally pulled the plug.  We tried ""race cars/airplanes"" and it was the same long, drawn out, boring content.  100% painful to watch.  Diggers starts on a good note but goes down hill quickly:  an excavator (or backhoe of some sort) digging a hole; describes that machine; shows early stage of hospital construction site (i.e. footings poured, rebar waiting for block to be layed).  The camera pans around, ocassionally zooming in on workers doing mundane tasks like moving plywood.  There is some background music; but it is not engaging.  The narration is sporadic and not particularly educational.  Later we watch a crane moving concrete panels onto a high rise building.  The crane also lifts an HVAC unit onto the building.  Understandably, it takes a while to lift the unit, and we sit and watch the whole boring process.  The race car DVD was similar.  Starts out promising:  an open wheel road race, cars zooming along, my kids are engaged.  Then, we watch pit crews unloading cars, and replacing tires on wheels.  My husband walked in at this point, watched for one minute and said, ""boring"" - ""Shhhh, we don't want them to learn that word"", I said.  This set is nothing like Real Wheels' Rocking Real Wheels.  That DVD has lots of footage of kids, great music, and terrific narration aimed at the young crowd.  This Mighty Machines set is literally like sitting at a construction site for 90 minutes.  If you think your child will sit and watch a construction site for 90 minutes, this is the DVD for you.  If your child is captivated at a construction site for 15 minutes - lights up when he sees digger, crane, dump truck, but then turns his attention to other things, these Might Machines DVDs are not for you.  I was disappointed with this set because I was looking forward to giving the boys something new to watch.  They've been watching Rocking Real Wheels for a year; and I was excited that they would have something new.  It was a complete waste of money.",1247788800,11,2303,4.594594594594595

3397621,3,B0016PWWRC,"This is my 3.5 year old's very favorite show. We really enjoy it and the other reviewers have touched on the quality of the show itself.

My comments are about the DVDs. We were first exposed to the show through Netflix and watched it there until it abruptly disappeared from streaming. Amazon to the rescue and we ordered them. The play quality is fine so from that angle, these are 5 stars.

A few things: Because the logo was different and this doesn't detail episode names, I wasn't sure that I was ordering the same show. It is. It's the cute Canadian show with the intro song, ""Mighty Machines, big and Mighty Machines, working for you doing mighty things, Mighty Machines!"" If your son is like mine, the song is as much a part of the appeal as the show itself. So one thing I was disappointed in is the episodes don't have the song in the opening or the credits. This disappointed my son.

There is no indication for which episode is on which disc, as they've grouped them into categories. If your child knows episodes by name, print out the list provided by the reviewer below and keep them in it with your discs so you know which episode is on which disc. I think this was an oversight by the company.

Another annoying feature is that the discs have mandatory previews that can't be skipped through because they have disabled menu access. This is unnecessary.

The menu is stilted. There are 3-4 episodes listed and then a section of ""Bonus Episodes."" They're not actually bonus--that's just how you access all the episodes you paid for.

The company also doesn't make it easy to determine if you're getting all the episodes or if you're overlapping with such generic names as ""Mega Pack"" and ""Super Pack.""  If you order ""Mega Pack,"" ""Super Pack,"" and ""Power Pack,"" you get all 39 episodes with no overlap. If you order any of the other titles (like ""Lights and Ladders""--those are names of individual discs contained within the ""Packs."" However, there is no overlap of episodes from disc to disc so if you order individual discs and no packs, you shouldn't have any duplicates.",1415059200,26,2088,4.611859838274933

If your child loves anything with wheels, this is a must-have. The price is a real bargain for as many episodes that you get. It's not a cartoon, the camera follows REAL ""big wheels"" doing REAL jobs. Each truck provides it's own commentary in its own voice (which, admittedly, for adults can seem cheesy at times) and teaches all about the functions of the vehicle. Canada really got this one right, and the theme song is really catchy!!!",1411171200,,615,4.703703703703703

They do voice overs for each of the trucks and give them names... Pretty cheesy!  I guess that's their way of making kids pay attention to what they are actually doing.  Overall, my son liked it but wasn't crazy about it but I guess it gets the job done of a video showing construction trucks doing what they do.",1403395200,,460,4.252873563218391

3397654,5,B0016PWWRC,"This is a fantastic 4-pack of DVDs. They have a very decent run time, over an hour, and you do have the option to 'Play All,' which I love. That way on each DVD it will play all the shows without me having to stop what I'm doing to click on the next title or episode. They also automatically start the first show after a few minutes at the menu if you don't select something. Another nice feature.  Keeps my boys entertained, while getting educated, for hours when I need to get things done around the house. I even find myself (and my husband for that matter) stopping to watch as well since they are so interesting. Great to take in my laptop on the airplane when we travel. My kids ask for it my name now...""Mighty Machines!""
Here is the list of shows on each DVD in the set. I actually wrote these titles with a marker on the DVD so when my son wanted to watch the Building Demolition or Garbage Trucks, I could tell which DVD that episode was on easily. The episode titles are fairly simple to figure out what the show is about...

#1. ""Roadways to Runways DVD"" (Blue DVD) :: Play All, At the Race Track, At the Airport, On the Road, Bonus Episodes (Picking Up the Garbage, The Fire Trucks, Building a Skyscraper, After the Blast. All Bonus Episodes are 3+ minutes each)
#2. ""Lights & Ladders DVD"" (Red DVD) :: Play All, At the Firehall, In the City, At the Garbage Dump, Bonus Episodes (Towers Tumbling Down, At the Construction Site, At the Demolition Site, At the Rock Quarry)
#3. ""Boats to the Rescue!"" (Orange DVD):: Play All, To the Rescue, Making Waves, In the Harbor, Bonus Episodes (Cement Truck at Work, the Truck Engine Line, Truck Cab Assembly, Sky-High Concrete Pumper)
#4. ""Diggers & Dozers"" (Gray DVD) :: Play All, At the Construction Site, At the Demolition Site, At the Rock Quarry, Bonus Episodes (The Fire Trucks, In the City, At the Garbage Dump, At the Firehall)

Some of these 'bonus episodes' are little snippits of what's on the other DVDs as you can see.

Final Tip - Buy these as birthday presents for all your friends' kids and the kids will love you and the mom's will love you even more. Nothing better than a gift that gives mom some 'time' to get things done and teaches the kids something along the way. Just think the 'Hot off the Press' episode, which is about making newspapers. That might be obsolete one day and your child will have known was a newspaper was! Better than buying more toys for kids in my opinion!

Every young boy should own a copy of this and the ""Mighty Machines Super Pack"" which I purchased as well.",1401840000,,2561,4.4173728813559325

Kind of like a personal tour of the construction site, the race track, the airport, and on and on. Well made and kid friendly language.

I feel good about letting him watch it. He has learned so much from these shows and comments on different things he's learned from them when we are out running errands and he sees trucks, trains, construction sights. My 3 year old niece even enjoys watching when she is over, and she is not one to sit for a long period of time. HIGHLY recommend this series!",1344124800,,533,4.287128712871287

This series is so simple, does not use cuddly animals or cartoons, and yet he is absorbed again and again.  He especially loves the Giant Tow Truck one from season 3.  I have been sucked into them as well.  They are very neat and his verbalization has shot up significantly since he started watching them.  I am not sure why America has not caught onto this format of children's programming....no real bells and whistles, no talking down to toddlers and young people...just well edited and full of Mighty Machines!

3397805,5,B0016PWWRC,"If you are a parent who is hesitant to even let your young one watch TV--then this is a great program.  I come from the camp of major distrust of TV viewing for young children.  I am not so strict to follow the ""absolutely no TV"" extremists--but i do limit TV/Video watching significantly compared to most American households (we don't even have a tv).  Mighty Machines is one of two television programs i let my almost 2 year old watch.  He started watching at about 18 months when he showed an interests in cars, trucks, construction vehicles etc, by chance at his aunt's house as she was flipping through the kiddie stations.  (This is totally a show that he himself selected and cannot get enough of watching--even if it is a rerun) Now that he is rarely at his aunt's house anymore i am compelled to come here and buy as many as i can for his collection to watch one episode every couple of days or so.

Why i like this program:  As a media person/producer myself, i know the tricks, tropes, and concepts behind how programs are created, produced etc.  I sincerely believe that the manipulation of time and space through editing can be confusing to a little person who is trying to figure out how the world works.  i also believe (as backed by scientific studies--just read the new one about sponge bob) that it contributes to short attentions spans and our fast-food/microwave culture in general with the fast cutting and leaving out the ""in between"" of a process.  Animations/cartoons/puppets/talking animals are products of an adult imagination--not a child's.  That sort of creativity/fantasy imagination doesn't begin until much later in humans.  New humans are fascinated with the real:  nature, how the world works, etc.

Mighty Machines is documentary in nature.  It is only 20 mins long and tries as much as possible to show all the steps in a process to really allow young minds to grasp and understand the workings of these different machines.  The takes are long and slow.  There are few jump cuts and there is minimal talking and music.  It really allows a young person to get into the process of how the world works and choose what he or she may want to focus on within the scene.  My little one DOES like going to a construction site and watching the machines.  He has a great attention span as evidenced by his ability to play independently and imaginatively without adult direction fr substantial periods of time.  So, to watch Mighty Machines is as close to being in person/on-site where the machines of our world work everyday.  He can also recognize and has started to differentiate between the different construction vehicles, cars, trucks, etc because of a combination of his books, toys, real life encounters, and Mighty Machines.

(As a note, even all of the adults who sit down and watch the program with him, myself included, are fascinated with the topics of the program--i never have had the thought or interest to want to know how salt makes it to my table from the mine--but now i know and it was fascinating to watch something that i take for granted that happens in the world every day)

It may take some getting used to for children who are used to being dazzled and entertained by hyper-color, fast paced, manic children programs.  But it is never too late to detox your child from this detrimental programing--all one has to do is start by turning OFF the TV--not even allowing them to watch Mighty Machines, and promoting and facilitating independent play.  Then when the time is right balance it all out by adding quality programs such as this one into their worlds.

Great place to look for advice on how:  Magda Gerber and her RIE philosophies (Your Self-Confident Baby) and janetlansbury dot com.",1321833600,2,3741,4.722650231124807

3397821,5,B0016PWWRC,"My son is pretty much obsessed with machines.  He just turned three and has had this 4 pack for quite some time now. The company sent it to us to replace a dvd that wouldn't work on our new dvd player.  (Shows how wonderful the company's customer service is, too, since we'd purchased the dvd at ToysRUs.)  I don't have any idea why there are bad reviews on this product.  I am not the type of mother who sits her kids down in front of the tv each day and lets them vegetate. They rarely, if ever, get to watch anything that doesn't have educational value, and I try to limit tv time to 30 minutes a day.
Since we purchased the first dvd, he's been singing the mighty machines them song and asks to watch the videos at least once a day.  If he can't watch the video he wants me to read machine books to him (about boats, cars, trucks, trains, anything that has an engine/motor in it) or he wants to play with his own machines.  Don't get me wrong, he loves a lot of other things, like music, books, drawing, etc... but he really wants to learn about machines, how they work and what their jobs are.  I think it's a very good interest and these dvds are very educational as well as entertaining. I even like to sit and watch once in awhile.
Even my 18 month old sits and watches sometimes.
If your boy or girl loves machines, these dvds will be a huge hit in your house.  I'd recommend any of the Mighty Machines series.",1300924800,,1419,4.1911764705882355

3397824,5,B0016PWWRC,"My 2 year old son is obsessed with fire trucks, bulldozers, garbage trucks, you name it. He loves watching these DVDs. So much so, that he's now figured out how to work the DVD player by himself so he can play these whenever he wants to. Parents will no doubt love the opening theme song, it really has the ability to stick in your head. All. Day. Long. And we find we can really relate to some of the lyrics, like ""Mighty machines. You can watch them all day and never know why. Mighty machines."" (I think that's what he's singing.) One can only assume the producers knew they were making a quality product that kids will demand to watch over and over and over again.

The price is great, the quality is pretty good, and the narrators are kinda funny when they act out the voices of the various trucks/ cars/ mighty machines.

He loves the video we have, and it works great for long trips. The voice overs for the trucks a cheesy, but hello, they are made for kids!

3397850,1,B0016PWWRC,"I'm at a loss as to how anyone, kids or adults, can find any entertainment value in this series of DVDs.  Based on the positive reviews, I purchased this 4-pack.  My 4 year old and 2.5 year old voted to watch ""Diggers"" first.  After 15 minutes, my 4 year old was asking for a new movie.  We sat through another 15 minutes, and I finally pulled the plug.  We tried ""race cars/airplanes"" and it was the same long, drawn out, boring content.  100% painful to watch.  Diggers starts on a good note but goes down hill quickly:  an excavator (or backhoe of some sort) digging a hole; describes that machine; shows early stage of hospital construction site (i.e. footings poured, rebar waiting for block to be layed).  The camera pans around, ocassionally zooming in on workers doing mundane tasks like moving plywood.  There is some background music; but it is not engaging.  The narration is sporadic and not particularly educational.  Later we watch a crane moving concrete panels onto a high rise building.  The crane also lifts an HVAC unit onto the building.  Understandably, it takes a while to lift the unit, and we sit and watch the whole boring process.  The race car DVD was similar.  Starts out promising:  an open wheel road race, cars zooming along, my kids are engaged.  Then, we watch pit crews unloading cars, and replacing tires on wheels.  My husband walked in at this point, watched for one minute and said, ""boring"" - ""Shhhh, we don't want them to learn that word"", I said.  This set is nothing like Real Wheels' Rocking Real Wheels.  That DVD has lots of footage of kids, great music, and terrific narration aimed at the young crowd.  This Mighty Machines set is literally like sitting at a construction site for 90 minutes.  If you think your child will sit and watch a construction site for 90 minutes, this is the DVD for you.  If your child is captivated at a construction site for 15 minutes - lights up when he sees digger, crane, dump truck, but then turns his attention to other things, these Might Machines DVDs are not for you.  I was disappointed with this set because I was looking forward to giving the boys something new to watch.
