5026335,5,B006WXHJXA,"What's better than America Pie? All the special features you get with it! The trilogy has the option of unrated or rated editions first off. Secondly, there's still deleted scenes post-unrated version! Each film has commentaries, multiple featurettes, and deleted scenes with introductions by actors and directors. There's a ton of interesting information you can learn about the films and a lot of neat ""how it's done"" type things you wouldn't think would be needed for a comedy film compared to a major block buster. This DVD 3 pack does not have American Reunion but compared to the Quadrilogy packaging, it's much better and doesn't scratch the DVD's nearly as much (My friend has the Quad). Plus this version has more features included with it AND this is $9! If you buy this then the American Reunion unrated version together it's cost less than the Quadrilogy. Overall worth it to buy this version instead of the four film version. Though it's different packaging, you'd be getting a much better quality product all around.",1414281600,,1030,4.959537572254336
5026336,5,B006WXHJXA,"If you want to laugh until you are crying, pick up this series now. They are hilarious. It doesn't include the latest one, the reunion, which is also great. It's a great deal at this price also. I would note that it does have some adult humor and nudity, so beware if there are kids around. Great coming of age type comedy and some of the best humor around though.",1401062400,,364,4.214285714285714
5026337,5,B006WXHJXA,"I had bought this as a gift for a friend, because I know he loves the franchise. He loved this gift.",1397433600,,100,3.8095238095238093

5026339,5,B006WXHJXA,"These are the best American Pie movies ever. All the original cast together. After part three, everybody went their own way. So, like I was saying, this is the unrated version 3-pack full with extras. This is surely a collector's item. Laughs, laughs, and laughs. This is a three disc set. American Pie languages: English and French, with optional English and Spanish subtitles. American Pie 2 languages: English with optional English and French subtitles. American Wedding languages: English, Spanish, and French with optional English, Spanish and French subtitles. All three movies are in the widescreen format.  I highly recommend this pack. Three for the price of one. This is awesome!",1365292800,2,689,5.263636363636364
