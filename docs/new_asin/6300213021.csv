226264,3,6300213021,"After breking his jaw filming City Heat

w/ C. Eastwood in late 1983, Burt had to

recover then starred in several bad one

name movies (Stick or Heat being the

worst!) - but then came this little ap-

preciated film! Kenneth McMillian and

Cliff (PT-109) Robertson are very good

in here too. Neat ending with burning

VA drivers license, which reminds me;

I need to renew my VA drivers license

this Friday. Enjoy this film - MAN LAW!",1154304000,3,438,4.5
226265,1,6300213021,"this yet another nail in the coffin of burt's career! looking out of shape and very,very unhappy, burt plays a c.i.a. killer who wants out so he quits and goes on the road. the c.i.a. of corse doesn't like that and wants him killed(big surprise)! well his car breaks down and he helps the man and daughter who are helping him fix it because they are being bullied by the local hate group.

  if that sounds like a fun movie to you,trust me it's not really that way. one more reynolds miss fire!!!! skip it",1150070400,,505,4.294736842105263
226266,5,6300213021,"Why don't they make movies like this anymore!!! This explosive action film starring the incomperable BURT REYNOLDS will make you laugh, cry, fall in love (with Burt) then crap your pants with the absolute fantabulousness of it all. (Yes I made up the word fantabuluos just to describe this movie, because there were no words in the dictionary that could possibly do it justice.) Reynolds, in all of his action starrin', tight pants wearin', gun slingin', lady killin' glory is a CIA agent who is unhappy with his job, so he leaves, and ends up in a small Eastern Oregon town where trouble is afoot. And when Burt Reynolds is around trouble you know he can't stay out of it. Taking us from the beauty of Eastern Oregon to a breath-taking scene in Los Angeles (Very important scene!!!), this movie is like a roller coaster that is going a million miles an hour, derails, lands on another track, then the other roller coaster is coming right at it and they crash and then a barn full of maniacal patroit propaganda explodes. Then from the ashes arises Burt, with the cold, cutting eyes that warn all other maniacal patriot propagandists ""Beware, Malone is coming for you!!!"" Often overlooked with all the action is the beautiful love between Malone and the girl at the gas station, and then his passionate love of his old partner. At times heart warmingly beautiful at others heart racingly explosive, this movie has it all.",1066694400,26,1421,4.733870967741935
226267,5,6300213021,"It astounds me that this movie exists. When I stop to think about it, my heart fills with wonder. This cinematic gem has gone unnoticed for 15 years but is an absolute delight to any who stumble upon it. Like many great artists, Burt Reynolds remains unnapreciated in his own time but his piercing eyes, succinct speech, and handlebar moustache will transcend to any future generation. This movie is the pinnacle of a career spanning nearly 40 years.
Reynolds, Richard Malone (or so you think) finds himself unhappy with his job in the CIA and pursues a much quieter life in the hills of the Cascade Mountains. While he is there he experiences many adventures, including a bare handed brawl on the city bridge and a ""mysterious object beneath the barbershop newspaper."" He leaves behind a trail of broken hearts and busted balls ending with a climactic exploding barn montage. This non-stop action thrill ride will keep you asking yourself; ""what on Earth is going on?!"" The cover art is composed brilliantly and is worth owning, in and of itself (Note: Reynolds skin tight dungarees, leaving very little to the imagination.) A must have item. When you find yourself blown away and begging for more, I would also recommend the movie ""Stick."" (AKA ""Malone goes to Miami.)",1065916800,18,1270,4.857142857142857

The plot is not the most original, but Reynolds is very believable as a rogue spy who gets involved with people oppressed by a power-hungry survivalist. The relationship between Reynolds and the teenage girl was also handled very well. The young actress (think her last name was Gibb) did a pretty good job as an awestruck teenager who counterbalances Reynolds' somber, serious character (though there are some fairly humorous moments too).

Overall, one of my favorites and I was glad to rediscover this on Amazon prime. Highly recommended.",1468713600,,597,5.091836734693878
226452,1,6300213021,Malone is a depressing slow paced drama which never goes anywhere. The entire movie takes place out in the hill country with little or no action or mystery actually developing. The characters are boring and not interesting. The villains are ludicrous. The only explosion is at the very end of the movie and it wasn't even impressive.,1466640000,,333,4.859649122807017

First off, I believe Burt Reynolds is like 5+ years older than Scott Wilson but I am way too lazy to look it up... yet in the film, Scott is the old wise farm man and Burt behaves like he is much younger. Also, I am about 90% certain that Burt is hitting on his daughter who they seem to be treating as if she is like 15.  It adds a very hilarious sexual undertone to this film.  Let's get to the awesome though.  Burt kills an absurd number of people violently in this movie and then, the greatest explosion ever to be put on film happens for no apparent reason.  This was a blind buy for me, and I do not regret it.",1464220800,,654,4.038759689922481

It seems this is the best they could do without spending huge bucks on a release that not many people are expected to buy. The only extras are trailers for this and a few other Reynolds films, which is disappointing as well. But considering ""Malone"" wasn't even released on dvd until a high-priced VOD dvd-r appeared a few years ago (and in a crappy printl), I'm quite happy to put this one in the collection.

Taking a vacation from the rom-coms Burt Reynolds is solid as the ex-CIA operative whose intent is to distill his brand of double barreled justice on a nest of ornery survivalists led by Cliff Robertson intent on forcing their will on innocent town folk .

226625,4,6300213021,"During his long and illustrious career, Burt Reynolds made a number of action-driven movies usually from a comical point of view. This however is an action-movie straight up, and one of my personal favorites among his body of work. Strange though, since it's not a particularly good movie. I guess it's all down to the old Burt-charm.
The movie is about a disillusioned operative, who jumps ship and starts looking for a hideaway out of reach of his former employers. When his car breaks down, he pushes it for miles until he finally comes across a garage off the beaten track. As it turns out, the garage-owner and his daughter are in a spot of trouble with the resident major land-owner, who is trying to take over the whole valley. Malone chooses to assist the garage-owner and use his considerable persuasive talents to force the valley brute to back off. At the same time Malones former employers have sent another operative in search of him. Explosive Finale.",1420761600,2,965,4.7844311377245505

The dvd picture has a bit of grain in some scenes but the colors like the blue sky is quite strong and the audio is quite clear. the dvd packaging is basic but looks ok, the movie is presented in a nice (16:9) 1.85:1 widescreen format.

226824,4,6300213021,"Not that this one can ever measure up to SHARKY'S MACHINE, which is Burt Reynolds' finest crime thriller, but I've got a fondness for MALONE, a film fueled by a low budget and starring a Burt Reynolds very much on the wane of his career. MALONE recycles one 1980s action trope after another, but the aging Burt was able to harness enough charisma and gravitas to make it work. That he exudes this air of world-weariness helps to sell the picture even more, for me anyway.

He plays a laconic ex-CIA hitman who is fed up with killing and whose true name we are never quite sure of. His new identity is ""Richard Malone,"" but it wasn't too long ago that he was burning an ID with the name ""John Haggarty"" on it. The story proper opens with Malone's car breaking down in an Oregonian valley. Stranded in a remote town while his car is under repairs, he's taken in by the kindly auto mechanic (Scott Wilson) and his teenaged daughter (Cynthia Gibb). Malone soon runs afoul of the local goons and dirty cops, all of them minions of an ambitious land baron (Cliff Robertson) who suspects that Malone has come to kill him. For Malone, half an hour into the picture, it finally gets personal. Before then, he'd been content playing a spectator's role.

MALONE is lean and mean and no fuss and no frills, unless you count Lauren Hutton as frills. I guess that's the boon of a limited budget. All you're left with is to just go ahead and tell the story. The plot is straightforward, pretty much lifting from that Old West theme of the gunslinger come to clean up the town. Reynolds demonstrates that he still has enough sand in him to mete out rough justice in convincing fashion. The action set pieces aren't exactly exceptional, but Burt invests enough in them that they're kind of fun to watch. My favorite bits are when he beats the holy carp out of that fat dude at the bridge and then there's his barber shop bluff while gazing into the barrel of a gun. There's the requisite sacrifice, of course, some close friend or associate of Malone's that needed to be murdered off so that Malone can muster that last erg of blood lust. And maybe a thrill of anticipation surges up your spine when our seriously cheesed off hero storms the land baron's well-guarded headquarters. It's worth it to hear the panic in Cliff Robertson's voice as he yells at his hired hooligans: ""He's coming here!"" And it turns out, Richard Malone, if that's his real name, isn't so fed up with killing after all. Those poor no-chance-having henchmen. But I've always wondered how Malone was able to figure out that that hombre was the very same one who'd suffocated his friend with a plastic bag. Maybe it's a skill taught one in the CIA, the skill of super-assumption.",1324166400,,2735,4.545638945233265

226827,4,6300213021,"If you enjoy Burt Reynolds films you will like this one, I did.  I have been trying to find it on DVD without any luck.  The movie is more serious than the ""Smokey"" movies and is along the lines of the ""Bourne"" films, except that this one was filmed in 1987 and thus not as action packed.",1221696000,,288,4.035087719298246

He leaves the CIA without permission and the top of the CIA wants him killed. He is driving to nowhere in particular when his car breaks down in a small Oregon town. He soon discovers that there is a supremacist in the town who wants to take it over for his group. He has the local sheriff in his employ. He kills people who do not want to sell him their property.

7805167,5,6300213021,"This movie is better than some critics say it is. Similar to (Charles Bronson's) Mr. Majestyk - it is not an action flick, although it similarly contains action. Rate it for what it aims to be - a drama. Well done Burt Reynolds (before the moustache).",1502409600,,251,4.478260869565218
7805168,4,6300213021,Typical Reynolds actioner. Interesting plot with lots of mayhem. Certainly the acting is only fair but keeps my attention while I ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill. Not deep but fun...good guy wins and megalomaniac loses.,1498089600,,233,5.0
