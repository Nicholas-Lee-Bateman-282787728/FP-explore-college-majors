8415240,1,B001PF73RC,"It's a shame that whoever did this DVD missed the opportunity to do something right. Many divers go to the Bay Islands and there is a lot of information on books and the internet, but no DVDs showing the beauty of the islands both above and under water.
 This is more a commercial add for the Dolphin Experience in Roatan. Having watched THE COVE, and being aware how much dolphins really suffer without their freedom, I'm not interested.
 There are so many other things to see and do on each of these islands (too many to describe in an Amazon review) it almost seems that the people behind this DVD went out of their way to create something mediocre. To top things off, the background music is pretty bad.
 The sad thing is that they did have a pretty good cameraman and excellent video equipment, which makes it unforgivable to have done such a bad job.",1292630400,,856,4.4743589743589745
8415241,1,B001PF73RC,I recieved the first one and try to play it and it didn't play in either my computer or my dvd player.  I sent it back and got another one and it had the same problem.  We never did see it.,1249776000,2,189,3.5853658536585367
