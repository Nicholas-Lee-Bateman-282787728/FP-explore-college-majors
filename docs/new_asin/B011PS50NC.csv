8724858,4,B011PS50NC,"The packaging is pretty terrible, but what could you expect for the price?

The show is still as good as it was when you were younger. While it's easy to nitpick and over-analyze Johnny Test, if you want a fun cartoon about a kid going on science-laden adventures with his hyper-intelligent pooch, the show is great.",1530576000,,316,4.642857142857143

8724861,1,B011PS50NC,I haven't watched any of the episodes yet but I am outraged by the simple fact of the case for the dvds came broken in pieces!! Secondly the awful casing idea... I mean come on. Now I need to buy myself a totally new and GOOD DVD case that holds nine discs.,1515456000,,257,3.9615384615384617
8724862,5,B011PS50NC,My 9yr old son loves Jonny Test and has for several years. Great value for getting seasons 1-5 all-in-one! The DVD's are loosely packaged inside and should be more secured but overall the packaging was done very well and I'm very happy with this purchase.,1511827200,,255,4.688888888888889

8724864,3,B011PS50NC,"Johnny Test is actually a pretty good series, not the best, but I once really liked it. If you don't know the plot, check its wiki, or just look up on Wikipedia. Like printed, this set has 91 episodes, 13 from Seasons 1-3 and 26 from Seasons 4 & 5. The set also has 8 selected episodes from Mill Creek's other children's licenses, including The Adventures of Nanoboy, Gadget Boy, World of Quest, Super Duper Sumos, Potatoes & Dragons, and Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors.
  I honestly think this is just one of my guilty pleasures, some others including Bakugan, but this release is compressed as hell. I never got the set itself, but I checked the information on the product page on Mill Creek's website. It said that this set has, get this, 9 discs (most likely all DVD-9). Each discs have between 9 and, get this again, 13 episodes per disc (counting any and all bonus episodes on the disc). The discs with 13 episodes are the two discs from Season 5. Didn't see that coming. Coming from that fact alone that these DVDs are bootleg quality, but the fact that this is exclusively Region 1 counters that fact. I'm kinda like an audio- & video-phile, and I like my stuff look real, so once I get this set, I just hope nothing screws up, cause I will not see that coming. The review will be edited once I actually get and watch this set.",1495584000,2,1335,4.40080971659919
8724865,5,B011PS50NC,This show is a lot better than Dexter's Laboratory and funnier too.,1469664000,,67,4.666666666666667
