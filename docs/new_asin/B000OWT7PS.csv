8187056,5,B000OWT7PS,"Excellent in its delivery of wrestling principles/techniques into the guard (or bottom scissor) position.  I'm no stranger to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Russian Sombo and Wrestling and I still think this is one of Hatmaker's most useful set of instructional DVDs.  Applying arm drags, whizzers and switches to escape from the bottom is brilliant and feels very natural to me.  It has worked too well for me while rolling.  Even my guard has become more active in that I squeeze the ribs with my legs more often than what I used to do in the traditional ""lazy"" guard. It's a great set of arsenals to have.  Brilliant work.  Great coaching.",1463961600,,632,4.805555555555555
8187057,5,B000OWT7PS,"I have a lot of Hatmaker's videos and books.
Most of them are very good.
This one belongs in the must have list of any serious martial arts student.
Getting off the ground is something you need to be able to do.
I put Hatmaker in the elite group of video instructors along with Tony Cecchine, Erik Paulson, some of the old Matt Furey stuff and really much more value for the money than the Gracies.",1372896000,,398,4.25
8187058,5,B000OWT7PS,"So far I've seen about half of this material.  Still their is enough that I've seen which makes me glad I bought this.
The hold downs and transitions to hold downs is important so that you can avoid raining down of punches / elbows.  The principles of turnovers are easily explained and something which I find off value.  I like the techniques which I've seen.  Now It's just about seeing more and doing the practice.  Good luck.",1351555200,2,429,4.51948051948052
8187059,4,B000OWT7PS,"My girlfreind does Judo, and gets on top of me and pins me eventhough she is slim. She makes me late for work everyday, now with the help of this video, i will be able to get from the bottom position and get on top and ride that wild mare once and for all.",1335744000,2,256,3.759259259259259
