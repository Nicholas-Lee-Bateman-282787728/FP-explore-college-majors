2663381,5,B000IU37TI,"""Guys in rubber suits stomping around on cardboard models!!!"" Sure, the picture quality is not perfect. And, the DVD does skip back and forth between Engrish and Japanese. But, that is what the studio had. Remember, not all of the episode was originally dubbed for US broadcast. It had to be shortened for commercials and time slots. So, you get what you get. $till well worth the memories...",1162944000,3,392,4.779411764705882
2663382,5,B000IU37TI,"Once again Ultraman scores a 5 star rating with Ultraman vol. 2. What an improvement on the overdub and video. They must redo vol. 1 and make it as good as vol. 2.

2663383,3,B000IU37TI,"FINALLY they release Ultraman on DVD in all its silly glory, and they leave out the FUNNIEST English-dubbed line in the whole series! BUYERS BEWARE!! The Japanese-only scenes are NOT all extra scenes that were never dubbed. In the episode ""Present from the Sky,"" an episode where the Science Patrol tries to get a fallen monster back into space, there was a line spoken by Fuji and DUBBED IN ENGLISH, ""I wish that flowers could fall from the sky instead of people and creatures (If that's not the exact line, it's very close)."" The only appearance of the line in this set is in Japanese with English subtitles that leave out all references to ""people and creatures"" -- not nearly as funny as the English dubbing. Click the audio button all you want, the dubbed version isn't there. 3 stars because of the RIP-OFF!! At least the subtitles that follow the missing dubbed line are extremely funny.",1162857600,3,894,4.7006369426751595
2663384,5,B000IU37TI,"Personally I have always loved watching Godzilla as a child and really looked forward to the release of the Ultraman series.

Let me say that also that my kids LOVE Ultraman (*maybe even more than Godzilla!)

Why mention my kids and how much they love Ultraman and how much I LOVED watching Godzilla movies as a kid?  Because Ultraman, Godzilla and the like NEED to be watched with imagination,

Here's the deal.  If you watch Ultraman, or Godzilla or any such films and see a man in a silly suit stomping around a cardboard city fighting monsters in rubber suits then YOU MISS IT!  Watch the show with your imgination and I PROMISE you'll have an AMAZING TIME!

Watch without it and you'll see a guy in a silly suit stomping around a cardboard city fighting other guys in silly rubber costumes.  It's that simple.

Personally I LOVED the first set and SO LOOK FORWARD to the next set.

Yeah I noticed the ""dubbing issues"" that were talked about in other reviews I've read but no big deal.  It's actually best to watch in Japanese with the english subs on anyway!

Anyway, I really enjoyed the first set.  So did my kids.  If you're a fan Ultraman or Godzilla or Gamera or the like, you'll like it too!",1162080000,2,1202,4.454128440366972
2663385,5,B000IU37TI,"If you watch these dvd's you will notice that while watching the English version, ocasionally it will automatically change to Japanese...I was like what the heck is this about. I thought I had defective dvd's. I wrote the company that released them and this is what they told me. The versions that were sent to them were in bad shape and much shorter than what is actually on each disc the way they are now. When they switch from English to Japanese, this is becuase these were added scenes that were originally not there when they were received. Since these shows are from the 60's, and obviously these are not in production any more, there's no way they can loop the new scenes.

So you pretty much just have to take them as is and enjoy them. These scenes were not contained in the original US release apparently.

I'd reather have them longer with Japanese than shorter, chopped up versions.

So just enjoy them everyone.

PS Volume 2 is set to be released November 7th 2006.  We need to remember that this series is 40 years old this year.  Not everyone can afford or maybe some studios are just too cheap to spend 10 to 20 million dollars on restoration of prints al la George Lucas with Star Wars.

We have to take it for what it is.

Just enjoy them.  We're lucky that we have something decent on dvd.  I know the audio problems are bad, but trust me, if the original makers were around, then maybe they could work their magic and fix the issue.  But I'm sure Ultraman has several owners now and are not filthy rich to restore these things.  Or are they?",1160352000,28,1606,4.4520547945205475

2663388,5,B000IU37TI,"My seven year-old son & I love Ultraman. He says, ""Ultraman is  not too violent and it's not too mean. And there is some silly stuff!"" The best thing about this collection is that it is in English, so I don't have to constantly read subtitles out loud. My son is a good reader, but he's just not that fast yet!",1362700800,,310,4.081967213114754
2663389,5,B000IU37TI,"My brother jokingly bought my then 2-year-old son an Ultraman DVD for Christmas in 2010.  He had found the DVD in some bargain bin somewhere.  At first, my son thought it was so dumb.  Then, like a switch was turned on, he LOVED Ultraman.  Over the course of a year, that DVD got cracked somehow and no longer played.  My son was very upset, which prompted me to buy this DVD set.  He absolutely loves it.  The 3 DVDs keep him constantly interested, which makes it worth the price.  And it's fun to see him react, being scared of some of the dumbest looking monsters.",1334188800,2,567,4.333333333333333

2663392,5,B000IU37TI,"Excellent collection of the second half of the classic television series.  I watched these shows as a kid on TV in the late 60's and it's all I remember and more.  Now my toddler son is as big a fan as I was back in the day.
The quality is better than would be normally be expected for film archived this long.  The translation from the original Japanese in the subtitles is quite accurate and the English dubbing is very well done as well.  This is the monster genre at it's cheesiest best.  You gotta love it.",1250208000,,511,4.22680412371134
2663393,4,B000IU37TI,"Relive your childhood with this great set. The quality is very good. These are slightly longer episodes than what aired on American TV. That being said, certain scenes DO NOT HAVE ENGLISH TRANSLATION! It's NOT a goof or mistake... those scenes were never translated. So, don't freak out if in the middle of an episode they start talking Japanese. It'll switch back to English in a couple minutes. Very Enjoyable!",1238284800,2,412,4.9
2663394,4,B000IU37TI,"Watching this series brought back memories of rushing home from school, grabbing a bologna and cheese and sitting in front of the TV every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and not moving for the next 30 minutes to watch my generation version of ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"".

I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because like the previous volume some of the English tracks were missing, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment.

Now if they would only put out a DVD set of ""Johnny Sokko and His Giant Robot"" , which was shown on Tuesday and Thursday, life would be complete.",1230854400,,574,4.509615384615385
2663395,4,B000IU37TI,"Hey, nothing to really complain about. It is Ultraman! When I first saw and purchased an Utraman vid on VHS some years ago from another source, I  was ecstatic! There were only a few episodes on it so it was just a teaser. I now own both sets of the DVDs and I am very happy with them. Sure there are a few places with subtitles, no matter still very enjoyable. Having an Ultraman viewing/party soon with a bunch of guys that grew up watching it.
I recomend both sets!",1211155200,,468,4.2
2663396,5,B000IU37TI,"People,

There are NO sound problems with these disks, meaning it is not a ""defect"" that the language sometimes changes to japanese. When this happens, it is because those are ADDED SCENES, not presented in the original United States television series. Therefore, just enjoy the bonus feature of having extra footage.",1192060800,6,317,5.215686274509804
2663397,4,B000IU37TI,"Volume 2 still has some glitches that should be fixed. Most of the glitches are in the audio but the picture is pretty good. It would be nice if the same people at Lowry Digital who did the Jamed Bond box sets would do these two volumes. However, after years of waiting for this it is still fun to watch. Excellent packaging.",1189728000,,325,4.258064516129032
2663398,5,B000IU37TI,"As with Volume 1, Volume 2 delivers! This is a great series with all the campy cheese and fun that I remember from childhood.

2663399,5,B000IU37TI,It's great to be able to watch these shows again! I lived in Japan in the mid-to late 60's and obviously watched Ultraman then along with all the other great Japanese TV shows of the time. I never thought I would be able to see Ultraman again-but even at 45+ I still enjoy watching them. Yes I suppose I'm going through a second childhood--but who care I'm going to enjoy every minute of this boxed set!! Highly recommended to kids today-even with all their high tech distractions kids really seem to like this show.,1183593600,8,516,4.5
2663400,4,B000IU37TI,"Watched ""Ultraman"" in Charleston, SC as a little boy on the ""Happy Raine"" show.  30+ years later I still like the show, has much self-effacing humor.  My little boy loves it.",1179878400,3,174,4.580645161290323

2663402,4,B000IU37TI,"I loved it when I was a kid and now my kids love it, too!  Hayata is brave and handsome.  My little girls all want to marry him.  Ito is funny and silly.  Aroshi is a great sharp-shooter.  Fuji is smart and nice.  Captain Mura is always in control.  We laugh when it occasionally lapses into Japanese for no apparent reason.  We gasp when Ultraman's light starts flashing.  It's just as good as I remember it.

I only have one complaint:  if you put the captions on, it sometimes translates into some bad words.  The actors aren't saying any cuss words, but it will show them on the screen!  So, if your kids aren't reading yet, it won't matter.  But if they are you might want to turn off those captions!",1169078400,5,705,4.282442748091603
2663403,5,B000IU37TI,"I took a big chance ordering volume 2.  I didn't want a cartoon (anime I think they call it), I didn't want the show in Japanese, I wanted the show as I remember it as a kid, with English overdubs, and I wanted the last episode.  I remember Ultraman loses to the monster in the last episode.

That's why I ordered volume 2.  I didn't think I'd view the other 18 episodes, I just took a chance that episode 39 (the set has episodes 21-39) was the one where Ultraman loses.  The last episode is called ""Farewell, Ultraman"", it's exactly the one I remember!!  But I find myself watching the others, which were originally aired exactly 40 years ago (December 1966 through April 1967).  I caught them on syndicated re-runs around 1970, though.

I've waited over 35 years to see that episode again!!  10 years ago, for the 30th anniversary of Ultraman, a VHS tape was released that had the first 4 episodes on it.  I've been looking for 10 years for more episodes, including the last, to be released.

Finally!!  If you buy this, it is interesting to watch in Japanese with English subtitles.  Some of the dialogue reads different that the overdubbed versions.  In Farewell Ultraman, the dubbed English version leaves open the possibility that Ultraman will return someday.  In the Japanese version with English subtitles, you see that Ultraman will definitely not be returning.",1167609600,4,1372,4.729957805907173
2663404,4,B000IU37TI,"I originally watched series 1 in dubbed English, because its the way I remembered it as a kid.  And like many, I though my DVD player was broken because it reverts to Japanese periodically.  Well, the novelty wore off and I started watching the episodes in the same manner that I watch foreign films, in the original language with subtitles.

And I'm glad I did.  The sound quality, particularly on volume 2, is far better than the dubbed English track.  You even get a fairly good simulated surround sound if you have a home theatre.  Most importantly, the acting and dialogue comes off as much more serious and not nearly as cheesy or condescending.  The show is much more enjoyable.",1167177600,11,685,4.658333333333333
2663405,3,B000IU37TI,"Volume two has this disclaimer on the back of the Episode guide.

""Before Ultraman aired on television in the US, the show was cut to fill a specific time slot and the English audio dubbing was created for this newly edited version. There are portions of the disc when the English audio will drop out and the audio will revert to the original Japanese dialog with English subtitles during these sections where the English audio does not exist.  BCI Eclipse did not have access to the original masters for this edition.  We have used the best possible masters available to us for this edition. There are some glitches in the master that may cause some pixilation during the show.""

The truth is there is a full, original English dub available!!  I have VHS editions of these episodes and original English dubbing exists in the exact places that Japanese audio is now replacing.  Perhaps, for some reason, BCI could not get the full, original English dubbing.  But it does exist.  The disclaimer just isn't true. Otherwise, the video is still very good !!

The content continues to rate 5 stars.  The fact that BCI is putting this product out as is rates 3 stars. We adults may be able to see past the Japanese audio with subtitles.  But it's very difficult for a new generation to appreciate it and get lost in the fantasy when the audio continues to remind them they are watching a TV show.

If you don't mind the same issues as Volume One, buy this product.  Even with its flaws, it's the best version out there.",1163462400,6,1513,4.5799256505576205
