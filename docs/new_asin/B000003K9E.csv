1178440,5,B000003K9E,"I was persuaded at first to watch the voyager series, i thought nothing could top the next generation, boy was i wrong. I found that the series really picked up in the third season. I found i was on the edge of my seat for almost every show! Definately a series to collect. *Although i would rather collect on DVD... hint hint*. I love the Doctor's witty comments, ""Im a Doctor not a door stop"" (plus so many more) The Next Generation seems so boring in comparison to Voyager, (but then so do most shows these days) Voyager is an origial idea, and a comfort to watch because its like visiting home.",995846400,,598,4.348214285714286
1178441,5,B000003K9E,"Well, if you are any kind of Star Trek fan, obviously, this is a ""must see"" episode.  It is key, of course, because it sets up the entire storyline for the seven year Voyager series...and I must say that this pilot seemed very promising indeed!
In this initial episode, we are introduced to the characters that will become central to the Voyager series...and an interesting bunch they are!  We have Maquis terrorists, seasoned Starfleet officers, ""new kids"", and convicted criminals....all with the potential for some VERY interesting and original character development and storylines ahead of them!
And the backdrop of all this couldn't be better...lost in the Delta Quadrant - 70,000 light years from home!  With a whole array of new aliens, new situations to encounter, etc.
Voyager, through this episode, promised some new, fresh adventure.  Some new kinds of Trek personalities.  Some new twists from the Berman Braintrust.
It was a great beginning!",995328000,2,954,5.1688311688311686
1178442,5,B000003K9E,"I grew up on Voyager I watched the crew grow, die, mourn, and go through hell through the past seven years. I like the other Star Trek shows but, this one is my favorite. It mocks the orignal. In a good way. The crew needs to get home in their final episode that is what the crew deserves. The crew really deserves that. This episode is the first of a new era that was spun short of delay. Seven Of Nine does not appear in the sereis until later, at the end of season three when Kes dies. This sereis is the best and it makes the other trek sereis look bad. I recommend this title straight from my little trekkie heart.",980812800,3,619,4.081967213114754

1178445,3,B000003K9E,"Although it begins with a slow start, Voyager begins to bring action and  drama to the Star Trek series. The story idea of having a crew lost in an  uncharted quandrant of space is spectacular. Having both crews try to come  together and work out there differences was an ingenius idea.
Caretaker  is an amazing start to a wonderful new Star Trek series.",962668800,,354,4.571428571428571
1178446,4,B000003K9E,"Like the pilot episodes for ""Next Generation"" and ""Deep Space Nine"", ""Caretaker"" was a fascinating mix of familiar concepts and brand new possibilities. Based on this program alone one would  think the production team would truly succeed in getting back to the sense  of wonder at the unknown that infused Star Trek before it got to the point  where the Federation became more thoroughly mapped than some parts of the  U.S.
To be sure, the ingredients were there. As portrayed by Kate  Mulgrew, Captain Janeway hits the right balance: not quite as thoughtful as  Picard but not as prone to ""cowboy diplomacy"" as Kirk. Add to  that an intriguing Vulcan security officer, a testy holographic doctor, a  highly vocal group of Federation rebels and a host of other potentially  interesting characters and you've got quite a crew. The story (and the  series) started with some nice nods to established ""Star Trek""  lore for the faithful and quickly ditched it all to put the crew 70,000  light years from their Starfleet support systems. This was the show's  boldest move and if they'd kept on the path this episode layed out they  might have surpassed their predecessors.
Like the premieres of ""Next  Generation"" and ""Deep Space Nine"" there's a deeper mystery  at work around our heroes and if they don't figure it out quickly, there  won't be a next episode. They do figure it, of course, and in the noble  Star Trek tradition they sacrifice a quick way home for the sake of others  less able to protect themselves. This time, though, the commanding  officer's decision does not get a unanimous seal of approval thanks to the  presence of the rebel faction who found themsleves dragged across the stars  just as Voyager's crew was. This group, called the Maquis, reluctantly join  up with Voyager's crew as they set off for what could be a several decade  journey home. This forced marriage between the disciplined Federation and  the individualistic Maquis offered great potential which was sadly  underused in future episodes.
Indeed, despite the unfamiliar surroundings  of the Delta Quadrant, many of the subsequent episodes relied on tried and  true Star Trek cliches. Aside from some really good character studies and a  few intriguing encounters with other races, an unshakeable sense of deja vu  quickly overtook the series. For this story, though, it all seemed so fresh  and dynamic and exceptionally easy to enjoy.",957744000,8,2422,4.98
1178447,3,B000003K9E,"""Star Trek: Voyager"" is undoubtley the worst of the Star Trek television series.  Each week the characters travel around the unknown regions of the Delta Quadrant on their pristine ship, meet some hard headed  aliens, get into some space battles, and move on to next week as if nothing  happened.  However, the 2-hour premiere is pretty successful in terms of  drama and action.  There is enough of an action quotient to keep the show  entertaining while we are introduced to all the characters and the  situation.  There is no doubt in my mind that ""Voyager"" was much  better in its earlier days.  Some of these episodes are worth seeing, such  as this one.  But when considering the direction the series has taken, I'm  not sure its really worth it.  Still, ""Caretaker"" is interesting  and entertaining.  The only making my ranking of the video lower is what  comes a few seasons down the line...",956707200,,898,4.758169934640523
7902747,5,B000003K9E,"I have to admit that this is the only part of that series that I watched.  I really liked the movie and when my husband returned it, it was lost somewhere in my sister's house, I had borrowed it from her to make a copy for me to watch.  Thanks to the vendor for getting it here, so I could give it to my sister.",1390608000,,311,3.769230769230769
7902748,5,B000003K9E,"I've got to admit, I've never really been a big fan of Voyager and DS9. My favorite Star Treks are the originals. I also liked The Next Generation and Enterprise. But the originals were my favorites. I felt DS9 and Voyager were okay, but they never really were able to measure up the the other Star Trek shows. ""Caretaker"" was the two-hour pilot episode, and unlike the majority of the series, I absolutely loved it. It's not only the best Voyager episode, but the best Star Trek pilot that was ever made! My dad feels the same way as I do about Voyager, but when I got this video and convinced him to watch it, he was also blown away by it. It's got a great story, it's action-packed, it's got a lot of humor in it, some good character moments, and some smashing visual effects.

The Plot:

Dispatched by Star Fleet to find a missing Maquis ship which disappeared into a region called the Bad Lands, the starship Voyager and its crew lead by Captain Katheryn Janeway departs on its maiden voyage. Encountering a mysterious anomaly, Voyager is hurled 70,000 light years into uncharted space. There, both the Maquis crew and Voyager's crew must band together in order to survive and find their way home. It's not long before Voyager encounters the strange array that brought them there which is controlled by a mysterious entity called the Caretaker. Now both crews must solve the mystery surrounding the Caretaker as well as save an entire civilization, the peaceful Ocampa, from being wiped out by the ruthless Kazon. But saving the Ocampa will also mean sacrificing their only known way home. So begins ""Star Trek: Voyager"" as this brave crew journeys through deep space on a quest to find Earth.

Highly recommended!",1327276800,,1719,4.704318936877076
7902749,5,B000003K9E,"I'd watch an episode of Star Trek if there was nothing else on to watch, but for some reason, something about ""Voyager"" intrigued me. After watching ""Caretaker"", I was instantly hooked.
Kate Mulgrew makes a superb showing as Trek's first female captain. ""Voyager"" has many firsts that have never before been done in Star Trek, such as being so far away from home.  Other episodes have lost contact with Starfleet, but they've still be close enough to home.  Voyager is out there in the middle of no where.
This first episode reminded me of the Newbury Medal winning book ""The Giver"".  The people were so sheltered in their world.  They didn't know what it was like on the outside.  Kes' people are kind of like that.  The Caretaker provides everything for them, but he is dying and is looking for a replacement.
This was definitely a great beginning to the show.  I can't wait to get the first season DVD set!",1073433600,2,909,4.608695652173913
7902750,4,B000003K9E,"""Star Trek-Voyager"" is the fourth series in the ever-lasting sci-fi franchise, and it's like ""Lost In Space"", but with a Federation crew, and they have definitely gone where no man has gone before.
As Captain Kathryn Janeway, Kate Mulgrew surely commands respect as she and her crew are blasted 70,000 light years away from home by some array called the 'Caretaker'.  The crew itself is quite diverse and interesting, especially Chakotay (Robert Beltran), Tuvok (Tim Russ), Tom Paris (Robert Duncan MacNeill), and B'elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson).  I'm not very happy with Neelix (Ethan Phillips).  I stick with the Doctor (Robert Picardo) as the most fascinating comic relief in the show.
""Voyager"" might have gone through a bumpy start with critics and fans alike, but I believe that this pilot episode delivers the goods, and it's better than the one from ""Deep Space Nine"".",1063411200,2,876,5.111888111888112
7902751,3,B000003K9E,"Days before this episode aired on UPN, Robert Picardo hosted a special, to tell the audience, what Star Trek: Voyager is about.
In late 2371, a renegade group known as the Maquis operate outside the law to right what they see as Federation injustices. After infiltrating a Maquis cell to apprise Starfleet of the group's activities, Lieutenant Tuvok, along with the crew of a ship commanded by the Maquis captain Chakotay, disappear in an area of space known as the Badlands. Tuvok's commanding officer, Captain Janeway, leads a mission to find the Vulcan lieutenant, enlisting the aid of Starfleet prisoner Tom Paris, a former Maquis member, to guide her ship, the U.S.S. Voyager NCC-74656, through the Badlands.
Considered a traitor by most of Voyager's crew, Paris strikes up a friendship with Ensign Harry Kim, a naive young Starfleet Academy grad. Kim learns that Paris was drummed out of Starfleet after his piloting error caused the deaths of three officers. The outcast joined the ranks of the Maquis, but was soon arrested by Federation authorities.
After reaching the Badlands, the U.S.S. Voyager encounters an inexplicable phenomenon that sends the ship hurtling to the far side of the Delta Quadrant, located 70,000 light years from their former position. The catapult effect kills a number of crewmembers, including the Chief Medical Officer, who is replaced by an Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH) that attends to the wounded. But the EMH has barely begun his work when the entire crew of Voyager is transported to what appears to be a pastoral farm, populated by friendly humans. But it's only an illusion; the farm is actually the interior of the Array, a huge space station, and the residents are holograms. The crew is imprisoned within a strange laboratory facility, alongside the missing Maquis.
After being subjected to a painful examination, the crews of Voyager and the Maquis vessel are returned to their respective ships, docked outside the Array. But two crewpersons are missing: Harry Kim and B'Elanna Torres, the half-Klingon, half-human engineer from the Maquis vessel. Returning to the ""farm,"" Janeway confronts the only remaining inhabitant, an old man playing a banjo. But the man cares nothing about their dilemma and offers them no information about the missing officers.
Noting that the Array is sending energy pulses toward the fifth planet of a neighboring system, Janeway sets course in that direction. Far beneath the surface of that planet, an ailing Kim and Torres regain consciousness in a medical facility. But what they're doing there "" and why "" they have yet to discover.
En route to the fifth planet of a neighboring system, Voyager's crew encounters Neelix, a Talaxian scavenger. He explains that the Array has been bringing ships into the region for many months. Neelix guesses that the ""Caretaker,"" who controls the Array, may have sent the missing crewmembers to the Ocampa, a race that lives two miles below the surface of the fifth planet. Neelix volunteers to be their guide and they accept.
Meanwhile, Kim and Torres are being cared for in the Ocampa medical facility. Although they now live in a subterranean society, the Ocampa inhabited the planet's surface until it was struck by an environmental disaster 500 years ago. Since that time, they have lived underground, with all their needs provided by the man they refer to as the Caretaker.
Beaming down to the planet's surface, Neelix introduces Janeway to the Kazon, a savage alien species that has taken possession of the arid Ocampan world. Janeway asks Jabin, the Kazon leader, if he can help them, but he refuses.
Neelix is hoping Jabin will trade Kes, an Ocampan woman he is holding captive, for some of Voyager's precious water. But the Kazon are more interested in obtaining all of Voyager's technology "" forcibly. When Jabin tries to take the crew hostage, Neelix helps them escape and beam back to the ship, along with Kes.
Kim and Torres persuade an Ocampan nurse to show them a route that could lead to the surface. On Voyager, Kes agrees to lead Janeway and the others through the tunnels to her underground city to search for the pair.
As the Array increases the rate of the energy pulses that power the city, Kim and Torres begin their journey, narrowly missing the search party from Voyager. Tuvok theorizes that the increased activity of the Array may indicate that the Caretaker is dying; he is clearly attempting to give them a surplus of power that will sustain the Ocampa after he is gone.
The search is complicated by a new turn of events. The Array is now firing a weapon at the planet to seal up all of the energy conduits, the tunnels that provide the only access to the city. This will protect the Ocampans, but prevent the others from escaping. Splitting up, Paris, Neelix and Kes find Kim and Torres, and send them up to Voyager. Then Paris and Neelix go back for Janeway, Tuvok and Chakotay. Chakotay's skepticism towards Paris' loyalty is erased when Paris saves his life.
Returning to the Array, Janeway again encounters the old man, whom she realizes is the Caretaker. He explains that he was bringing beings from across the galaxy to the Array in the hopes of finding a compatible species with which he could procreate, thus providing the Ocampa with someone to care for them after he dies. But no species has been a match so far.
Janeway tries to convince the Caretaker to send Voyager and the Maquis ship back home, but he refuses. Apparently, the Caretaker wants to destroy the Array so that it won't fall into the invading Kazon's hands. But he dies before he can carry out his plan, and Janeway is left to decide whether to use the Array to get home "" which would leave it intact for the Kazon "" or to destroy it and save the Ocampa. She chooses what seems to be the only moral option and makes a mortal enemy of the Kazon, even it meant violating the Prime Directive.
With Chakotay's ship destroyed in the battle with the Kazon, Janeway asks the Maquis to become part of Voyager's crew. She also allows Neelix and Kes to stay aboard. With Chakotay her First Officer, Tom Paris reinstated as a Starfleet lieutenant, and Torres and Kim cured by the Emergency Medical Hologram, Janeway and her new crew set course for the long trip home, 70,000 light-years away.",1058054400,,6306,4.856081708449397
7902752,5,B000003K9E,"The four series in the ""Star Trek"" saga, ""Voyager"" had the advantage of the best pilot episode in the history of the franchise to date.  The reason for this is probably because unlike its predecessors this ""Star Trek"" ended up taking place in a quadrant far, far away, although the series was set in the same time period as ""The Next Generation"" and ""Deep Space Nine.""  Unlike the ""Enterprise"" of Kirk and Picard, ""Voyage"" was a smaller Starfleet vessel, with a crew complement of only 150.  While chasing a ship of Maquis rebels, ""Voyager"" is sent by a freak plasma storm to the Delta Quadrant, from which it would take about 75 years to get home to the Alpha Quadrant.  ""Caretaker"" (January 15, 1995) the first two episodes comprising the pilot, establishes not only how the starship ends up in the wrong place, but also how they ended up being trapped there.
Written by Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, with producer Rick Berman getting an additional story credit, ""Caretaker"" develops internal conflicts to go along with the main external one.  Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) is not only trying to get back home but has merged the crew of the Maquis ship with her own and made its captain, Chakotay (Robert Beltran), her First Officer and B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Biggs-Dawson), a half-Klingon half-human, the Chief Engineer.  Her Security Chief Tuvok (Tim Russ), is a Vulcan who had been an undercover agent on the Maquis Ship.  In terms of the original crew of ""Voyager"" there is perennial bad boy and hot shot pilot Lt. Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), young homesick Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang), and a holographic doctor (Robert Picardo).  Also thrown into the mix was the friendly Neelix (Ethan Phillips), one of the first aliens ""Voyager"" encountered in the Delta Quadrant, and Kes (Jennifer Lien), his Ocampan companion.  The opportunities for interpersonal conflicts (and relationships) were readily apparent.  Basically the first half of ""Caretaker"" gets ""Voyager"" and the Maquis ship to the Delta Quadrant and the second half establishes why they end up stuck there, which also adds a key element of guilt and responsibility to the character of Captain Janeway.  The title character of the pilot is a mysterious and powerful alien whose technologically advanced machine was responsible for the plasma storm, and which is drawing other interested parties to it as well, adding even more complications to the premise of the show.
Having done the ""commanded to wander"" bit twice with the first two ""Star Trek"" series, and trying for something different with ""Deep Space Nine,"" which started out as sort of a frontier outpost type show but which eventually returned to form with its own little vessel the ""Defiant,"" those looking after Gene Roddenberry's legacy really went for something different this time.  With ""Voyager"" this ""Star Trek"" franchise was given something very close to a blank slate.  Granted, in time they would manage to work in Q and the Borg into this series as well, but the premise for ""Voyager"" was just so rich and detailed.  With the fifth series ""Enterprise"" returning to a far simpler premise, ""Caretaker"" continues to stand as one of the finest science fiction pilots in television history.  Even if you are not a Trekkie but are simply interested in how to create a solid television series, this two-part episode provides a nice textbook example of how to do it right.",1052956800,2,3420,4.975438596491228
7902753,5,B000003K9E,"Exciting, intriguing and featuring the most inventive plot device in any Trek series, 'Caretaker' is a real audience pleaser, grabbing us from the start and keeping things moving along briskly.  The teaser features one of the mighty Cardassian ships in hot pursuit of a band of Maquis in a 39 yr. old relic; both of them ending up in The Badlands, an area of space overrun with plasma storms.  The Voyager, a Federation ship capable of negotiating the unstable Badlands, is sent after the Maquis who unknown to them has an undercover Federation agent working among them.  The two ships become unfortunate victims of an alien entity who whisks them 70,000 light years from known Federation space; eventually the two separate crews are forced to meld together out of the necessity to survive.
Though not as impressive looking as the ST: DS9 pilot 'Emissary', this series opener can stand on it's own successes.  The design and look of the Voyager was obviously given some serious thought; the introduction of bio-neural packs seems insignificant when first mentioned but comes into play considerably in future episodes.  The addition of the holographic doctor is also another great invention; giving him such a sharp wit and acerbic tongue is also a nice touch, a step away from the normally sensitive portrayals we've been used to.  And having gone down this road a couple of times already the production and creative staff demonstrated a sharp intuitiveness to the fashioning of this pilot show.  Each character is rightly placed and introduced in turn; we get a chance to get to know a good deal about each of them.  There is no fat in this story either, with only essential elements brought into the foreground; what's presented is easy to follow and the crews' dilemma quickly absorbs our interest.  The Caretaker itself is a classic science fiction invention - it makes me think of the Philip K. Dick book 'V.A.L.I.S.' that also featured a comparable array like device as well as a few vaguely similar themes.  Janeway's difficult final decision in handling The Caretaker would haunt her throughout the continuation of the series providing future interesting stories and subplots.
The mixture of characters is as near perfect as you could get, with the casting of movie and television veterans Kate Mulgrew, Robert Beltran and Robert Picardo a real coup for the Trek staff.  They had long been capable actors and their presence among the relatively unknown group of performers filling out the rest of the cast was a real and necessary punch to the lineup.  Robert Duncan McNeill and Tim Russ had played previous roles in Trek shows and movies and so impressed the staff that their parts were created specifically for them.  Everyone grew into their roles nicely as the series progressed, paying close attention to their characters' backgrounds and adding the necessary nuance and depth to each one.  Though I've read several reviews here knocking the Voyager series I really feel that it's every bit as good as the other previous Trek incarnations.  It's best to watch this series from the beginning rather than try to pick it up by watching singular episodes sporadically; the same advice can be applied to watching Deep Space Nine that had a similar variety of main characters with extremely different - and sometimes difficult - backgrounds.  Missing an occasional episode can create some confusion but missing several episodes will create an overload of confusion.
A final note: if that doctor present in the Ocampan medical bay looks familiar to you, he should.  The actor's name is Bruce French and he was featured in the superior ST: TNG episode 'The Drumhead' as the assistant to the J.A.G. officer.",1044057600,2,3711,4.9789644012944985
7902754,5,B000003K9E,"""Caretaker""-Despite what some people might think, Voyager began with the idea of returning to unknown space, therefore giving ""Voyager"" a hint of similarity to the original series, which was accomplished. ""Caretaker"", ""Voyager"", and its cast led the way for this idea, and I think they did a fine job, despite a few minor plot-holes that non-regular viewers of ""Star Trek"" wouldn't notice, anyway. In any event ""Caretaker"" deals with the heart-wrenching decision-Do we take ourselves home, or save a group of strange people from their enemies? The character of Captain Kathryn Janeway is most interesting when you ask yourself ""Would Kirk, Picard, or Sisko had the guts to do the same?""",1028764800,,686,5.1891891891891895
