8347785,1,B001XVA71M,"Read the fine print!  Only on the back picture, wrong region for the U.S.  I would have expected this to be in the description.",1436832000,,127,4.25
8347786,5,B001XVA71M,"Weird, artsy, and kinky in all the standard Bruce LaBruce kind of ways.",1434931200,,71,4.538461538461538

8347788,5,B001XVA71M,"I have waited a LONG TIME for this DVD.  I remember watching this film on the big screen at the Broadmoor Plaza Screening Room when it first came out.  The newspaper I was working for sponsored the event and the house was packed.  Loved it then, and love it now!",1425427200,,262,4.2
8347789,2,B001XVA71M,this will teach me to buy a movie before I have seen it. My advice will always be watch it first,1402358400,,96,3.619047619047619
8347790,3,B001XVA71M,"from its 90's release until now, it was shockingly on point at the time and even now, seems ahead of its time. I mentioned to the director I'd seen this and he reprimanded me this wasn't his only work but the only one i'd seen, then and now. I liked the scenes that focus on how far out LA can be, then and now, in a way that at least passes for normal. Seems a little dated now to me.",1389139200,,385,3.825
8347791,1,B001XVA71M,"I was very excited to receive Hustler White in DVD form.  I've had the VHS version for years, now in faded and worn condition with time passed.  When the advertised
Hustler White - Special Edition DVD arrived, it proved to be unplayable in this region.  With negotiation, I was told to keep the DVD and my money would be refunded.
But the experience was a lousy one.  I already loved the movie and to order it, wait for it, and then find I couldn't see it, not good.  I'm sure the distributors knew that this
would not be playable in a U.S. location and shouldn't advertise and sell such under those circumstances.  Bad business.",1368748800,2,629,4.473684210526316
