2987701,3,B000WNOVCS,This is designed for someone with a knowledge of these kinds or exercises. I had a hard time following. I think if you were already familiar it would be great.,1307923200,5,159,4.333333333333333
2987702,5,B000WNOVCS,"I've used this DVD over and over again and my baby seems to enjoy it quite a bit. I especially love the section with 'short busy mom routines' that are only 10 minutes long and are very easy to fit into a busy day. Instructions are straight forward, poses have the right level of difficulty for a new mom and there is lots of meaw-moo play together with the baby. Wonderful alternative to the Baby Boot Camp outdoor classes that we usually go to. This is the DVD that every mom would love. Great product!",1299024000,19,504,4.315789473684211
2987703,4,B000WNOVCS,"The Mom and Baby Fitness Deluxe Edition includes 2 DVDs; one for use with a young baby and one for use with a toddler. You can watch it start to finish or you can do the 3 mini workouts separately. For parents, it tones arms, thighs, rear, and abs, burns calories, and promotes bonding with your baby / toddler. For the babies and toddlers, it encourages strength and flexibility and improves balance and coordination.

The first time Sydney and I worked out with this DVD I laughed. I didn't think it was going to give me any kind of workout. There are 3 parents with their children to show you how to do the exercises, and the DVD starts out kind of slow. I quickly realized that even a slow-paced workout is still a workout! They use yoga, Pilates, and stretching to help you tone and strengthen your body, and everything is focused around your child which is great. I enjoyed having a workout I could do and still feel like I was playing with Sydney. I have to say the next morning my lower body was definitely sore, and Sydney and I have continued to use this DVD to workout (Sydney has learned to copy my squats).

For those of you that work out on a regular basis or that like fast-past workouts, this DVD set is probably not for you; however, moms with young babies and moms that want something simple to help get their body back (like me!) will probably enjoy this DVD. If you have any more questions about this DVD set, feel free to ask!",1268006400,74,1447,4.355555555555555
2987704,5,B000WNOVCS,Great DVD for mom and baby to work out together! We love it! The mom and baby on the DVD are fun to watch and her instructions are easy to follow. I would buy this for any of my new mom friends!,1263772800,5,194,3.642857142857143
2987705,3,B000WNOVCS,"I wasn't very impressed with this DVD, as it was pretty dull. It is broken into sections which was nice if you are short on time, or want to focus on certain areas.

2987707,5,B000WNOVCS,Short workouts for when you are busy are great.  There are yoga moves that you and baby do together and some just for baby.  Love this video and the instructor is great.,1441238400,,169,4.25
2987708,3,B000WNOVCS,"I'm actually not going to use this, for 2 reasons:  (1)  You have to be on your knees quite a few times, sometimes with all your weight on your knees for an extended period, and sometimes while also holding your baby.  I inherited bad knees and even just kneeling for a second gives me out-of-allignment knees for days.  I workout all the time without going on my knees, including DVD workouts, so I wasn't too worried about it until I watched this the first time.  Some would say I should have known, but I didn't.  And if you don't either, consider this fair warning.  (2)  There is a lot of what I'd call ""fake-happy baby talk"" throughout.  I do talk to my baby like that naturally, but somehow when it's chanted as part of a workout (""Cross, cross, applesauce!!!"") I just lose my will to live, let alone put effort into a workout.  Something about hearing that again and again, let alone chanting it myself, makes me want to slap someone.  So, while this DVD is clearly great for a lot of other people (based on the ratings), it's not for me.  If you happen to have either of these issues with exercising, be forewarned this may not be the exercise DVD for you.",1439769600,,1165,4.392523364485982

I typically can't get through the whole dvd because she looses interest, so sometimes I will finish the dvd without her and use a bumbell while she plays or naps.  The women who does the dvd is a bit eccentric, but I think all excercise dvds will have a bit of that, especially when a baby is involved, and she was no where near as bad as some.  I also bough the happy baby workout, and preferred this one, especially when she was younger.  The happy baby video had more excercises that made her get slightly scared.",1405468800,8,558,4.285714285714286

I couldn't get 5 minutes into any of them without him crying.  This is in a class of it's own.  My baby LOVES this.  I do it just to entertain him now, even when I don't feel like I need to move!  It really does give me a good session also, though, and it focuses on developing and reviving body strength in the areas new moms need.  This DVD taught me how to play really well with my baby.  After doing this lots, I have now figured out modifications to really include my baby when I do the other DVD classes I own, and now I'm even feeling ready to include him in my self-led yoga practice.",1401062400,3,747,4.075342465753424

2987720,5,B000WNOVCS,Good moves to do while also utilizing the baby. I highly recommend for moms wanting to try moves with their baby,1396137600,,112,4.380952380952381
2987721,5,B000WNOVCS,"I liked this, but if I were experienced it probably wouldn't push me.

I wish I had gotten it sooner; baby was about 8 months when I started and now at ten months, he is a little too active for the video sometimes.

I am looking forward to ordering and trying the toddler work out soon too!",1379289600,,481,3.82
2987724,5,B000WNOVCS,"This was well worth the money. The exercises are easy enough to do after baby comes but you can make more difficult as your strength returns. Also, you use baby as your ""weights"" so as baby grows so does your difficulty :-) my baby loves doing these exercises with me and LOVES baby yoga. Doesn't love the massage part but it has helped with gas and sleeping so we just push through (doesn't cry just squirms and kicks).",1378080000,,420,4.397435897435898

2987728,5,B000WNOVCS,This video is for a mom who wants to work out with her baby.  You use your baby as a weight and if he is fed and rested he'll  be entertained and happy.  She also tries to use his toys and the moves to be stimulating for your baby.,1371513600,,231,3.673469387755102

2987731,4,B000WNOVCS,This giave me some good ideas to try with my four month old.  He likes the tummy workout section the best because that one has a lot of interaction. I like the DVD because I get to play with him while working out. A couple reviews said that this has a baby and a toddler section but it doesn't. It is probably most useful for moms with babies that have good head control but aren't mobile yet.,1340582400,21,393,4.103896103896104

2987734,3,B000WNOVCS,I like the video. I like being able to work out with my son. It is a bit advanced for me but not that bad. I would recommend it but it may take a little longer to do the moves for a beginner like me. You can definitely feel it afterwards.,1316563200,5,238,3.6862745098039214

3222225,5,B000WNOVCS,This video is for a mom who wants to work out with her baby.  You use your baby as a weight and if he is fed and rested he'll  be entertained and happy.  She also tries to use his toys and the moves to be stimulating for your baby.,1371513600,,231,3.673469387755102
3222226,4,B000WNOVCS,"This is a great way to get back into some basic exercise after your baby is born.  I like that I can do the entire work out or just pieces of it and it incorporates time with the little one.  Of course once my baby got bigger he wasn't such a willing participant anymore, but it helped me get started.",1355616000,5,301,4.0
3222227,1,B000WNOVCS,this was a used beat up dvd really and it was describe as new ! i only used it once and that was it,1354752000,2,99,3.1666666666666665
3222228,4,B000WNOVCS,This giave me some good ideas to try with my four month old.  He likes the tummy workout section the best because that one has a lot of interaction. I like the DVD because I get to play with him while working out. A couple reviews said that this has a baby and a toddler section but it doesn't. It is probably most useful for moms with babies that have good head control but aren't mobile yet.,1340582400,21,393,4.103896103896104
3222229,5,B000WNOVCS,"Love this DVD.  Baby loves it too! He laughs and giggles through the whole thing, and I feel like I got a good workout without being whipped into wet noodle status!",1330732800,5,164,4.290322580645161
3222230,5,B000WNOVCS,"This is great, it has many different options.  There is the long workout and several shorter ones. On other videos the shorter ones are sometimes just segments of the long workout, not the case here, they are completely new.  Baby had fun with it too.",1326153600,5,251,4.555555555555555
3222231,3,B000WNOVCS,I like the video. I like being able to work out with my son. It is a bit advanced for me but not that bad. I would recommend it but it may take a little longer to do the moves for a beginner like me. You can definitely feel it afterwards.,1316563200,5,238,3.6862745098039214

8224391,5,B000WNOVCS,"I love this DVD! I've had it for 7 1/2 years! Started it with my son shortly after he was born and we did it together almost daily until he was about 5 months old! He almost never lasted the whole way through without fussing so I loved the shorter sections. He loved the baby yoga and baby massage sections!
I also did this weekly with my almost 4 year old and fior he first time yesterday with my 7 week old baby. My newborn loved it & made it through the whole thing!
The only equipment needed is a mat, blankie and rattle(s) for baby. Once mobile it isn't a good option but it's great from 6 weeks-5/6 months!",1487548800,,612,4.108333333333333

8224394,5,B000WNOVCS,"I really enjoyed the exercises on this DVD. Same girl that leads the prenatal yoga/Pilates DVD. It helps you stay stretched, energized and tone up your body after pregnancy. It also does a great job at involving baby in the exercise. It gives you something t do on those long days at home with baby.",1472774400,,299,4.454545454545454
8224395,1,B000WNOVCS,"I tried to use this DVD on many players and did not work. Just showed the FBI Anti-Piracy Warning. Anytime I tried to fast forward or press to go to menu, it said operation is prohibited. I'm assuming this DVD was illegally copied.",1469145600,4,231,4.395348837209302
8224396,4,B000WNOVCS,"My baby is 11 months and walks, tried doing the workout with her but she had no interest. She was more interested in walking around or climbing on me, and some of my workout scared her. I was disappointed not in the product but the fact that it didn't personally didn't work for me. I was able to do some workouts and they were good workouts, they are very slow pace but you will definitely get a workout carrying you baby around!",1457222400,,430,4.2560975609756095
8224397,3,B000WNOVCS,"I found it a bit too challenging as an uncoordinated Mom with a weak core from a c-section (didn't try it several months after having my baby). For ladies with good balance and more advanced levels of fitness, it's a great pick.",1450224000,,228,4.4523809523809526
