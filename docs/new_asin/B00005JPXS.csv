1577497,3,B00005JPXS,"The Spiderwick Chronicles, directed by Mark Waters, and based on the children's books by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi, begins as an emotional family drama but quickly deteriorates into a clich-ridden attempt at riding the ever-thriving, sci-fi fantasy coat tails of the Harry Potter films. Except, the producers of the Harry Potter films understand that today's children are the smartest children in history and are not likely to fall for poorly crafted, dumbed-down storytelling even if it did open on an IMAX screen.

The film begins when Helen Grace (Mary Louise Parker), newly separated from her cheating, no-good creep of a husband (Andrew McCarthy), moves herself and her three children from New York City to her Aunt Lucinda's spooky Victorian mansion in upstate New York. Aunt Lucinda Spiderwick (Joan Plowright) lives in a sanitarium and has left the house to her niece, Helen (though Lucinda is an only child and therefore can't be anyone's aunt, technically speaking). The children, twins Jared and Simon Grace (played by Freddie Highmore in a dual role) and daughter Mallory Grace (Sarah Bolger) all deal with the separation of their parents in their own special ways. Jared is giving mom the silent treatment except when he's not and spouting clichs like ""Dad left `cause you didn't listen to him."" Mallory has focused her attention on fencing and defending her mother's honor. Simon, the geek-child does not ""conflict"" and therefore exists in a world of passive avoidance. That is, until invisible goblins catch him and he becomes a new and improved Simon filled with lots of conflict and purpose.

Within minutes - no, make that seconds - of moving in, Jared becomes spooked by a creature that, incredibly, appears to live in the walls of the Spiderwick mansion. By dinnertime, weird things happen and stuff disappears. In full clich form, Jared, the angry, silent kid gets the blame. When he crawls into the dumbwaiter to get away from it all, he hoists himself into a secret attic where he finds two fascinating things: a honey-guzzling gremlin named Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) and a book entitled Field Guide to the Fantastical World All Around Us by Arthur Spiderwick, the family's great uncle (performed by the talented David Strathairn). Thimbletack's main function is to guard the Field Guide above all else and although he warns Jared (several times) not to open the sealed book, Jared goes ahead and does so anyway (of course).  Through flashbacks, we learn that Great Uncle Arthur has discovered the secrets of the invisible world in the woods surrounding the Spiderwick mansion. Arthur has documented years of research and secret findings in his Field Guide complete with extensive illustrations and instructions for keeping the goblin universe in line. Because the secrets in this book could unleash death and destruction across faerie, gremlin, and humankind, after sealing the Field Guide and hiding it in a trunk in the attic, Arthur Spiderwick is whisked away by snow faeries because he knows too much and must be protected. Which brings me to the one of the many holes in this story: if the Field Guide's contents are so dangerous, why did the snow faeries leave it behind where the evil goblins could very likely get their claws or paws or hooves on it?

The Spiderwick Chronicles is a fast-paced film - too fast, in fact. The viewer has no time to adjust to quick changing, illogical sequences while trying to come to terms with the sometimes underacted/overacted performances from some members of the cast, most notably, Mary Louise Parker's vacant interpretation of Helen. In one scene, a knife-wielding Helen stares blankly at her knives and unenthusiastically exclaims ""It's a good thing we're New Yorkers."" I didn't know whether to agree or be offended.

Throughout this film, the Field Guide is dragged around, hidden, pulled apart and soiled (to name a few things), but none of the characters ever actually reads it. They flip through it a few times and talk about it a lot but that's about it. Right before the movie degenerates into a chaotic frenzy with the family fighting to save themselves from the evil ogre Mulgrath (performed to frightening excess in part by Nick Nolte and partially through some creative animation techniques), an all-out battle of exploding tomato sauce and oatmeal bombs ensues. While all this was happening, a little boy in the row in front of me asked his dad, ""Why don't they read the instructions in the book?"" Exactly.

Overall, there's some good animation, a few magnificent aerial sequences, some very pretty flower faeries, a cast of greats and just the right bit of green slime, but this film falls short in the most important areas: storytelling and performance. And I would warn parents to think twice before allowing children under the age of 7 or 8 to see this because of dark themes and very scary animation.",1203292800,3,4905,4.997552019583844
1577498,4,B00005JPXS,"I doubt that THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES will enjoy that same longevity that the film adaptations of HARRY POTTER (and possibly even the current CHRONICLES OF NARNIA) will.  However, it is nonetheless a more solid adaptation of its source material than the tonally misguided SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, more down-to-earth than the lovely but boring GOLDEN COMPASS and FAR superior to the horrific ERAGON.

The SPIDERWICK books are slight volumes indeed, and the movie easily adapts all five of them into one film less than 2 hours long.  Unless the film is a hit and its makers decide to ""invent"" their own sequels, this CHRONICLE will stand alone.  And that's probably okay.  It's nice to see a ""family epic"" that doesn't have a transparent agenda to be the first in a series of smash hits.

It's a relatively humble story, told with simplicity.  It begins with that most tiresome of all family movie clichs...the newly single mother moving into a decrepit old house in the middle of nowhere with her unhappy city kids.  The children hate the new little town they have to live in, the creeky and creepy old house and to some extent, their overstressed mother.  Isn't there any other way to get a family into a ""haunted"" or ""mysterious"" house anymore?!?!

Fortunately, this worn-out idea is quickly thrust aside, as one of the kids (played by young Freddie Highmore of FINDING NEVERLAND) discovers a hidden room that holds the secret workshop and writings of Arthur Spiderwick, a long gone relative who is reputed to have been more than a little nuts about pursuing his life's work of documenting the magical ""other world"" of fairies, goblins, etc. that exists right along side ours...only invisibly.

As you might guess, it turns out this world exists. At first, no one believes young Highmore, especially his twin brother (also played by Highmore) and his older sister.  But they soon embark on adventures that prove the existence of this magical world, and unwittingly they have also enabled that world to threaten their very lives.

The movie is partly an exploration of the magical world, as we learn some of its rules and meet its inhabitants.  Most enjoyable is Thimbletack, a little creature charged with guarding the book that contains all these secrets.  He's got a love of honey, which is good, because feeding him a honey-smeared cracker calms his tendency to turn into a little, green, angry ogre.  All the creatures are CGI rendered and the effects, while not earth-shattering, are convincing enough to allow for proper suspension of disbelief.

The others parts of the movie are a detective story (as the kids try to put together the truth) and some light action sequences, because in the end, the goblins must be battled.  There is also a subplot featuring David Straithairn (as Arthur Spiderwick) and Joan Plowright that I won't go into any detail on, because it is the source of the lovely and satisfying ending.

The movie is perfectly entertaining, but hardly flawless.  After awhile, you realize that virtually the entire thing is taking place at the one house, with brief forays to a magical glade and to the town.  It feels a little ""stagebound"" for lack of a better word.  In some ways, this keeps the story small and more grounded in our world.  But it also prevents any sense of truly sweeping vistas (despite one scene of the kids flying on the back of a Griffin).  This makes the film seem just a little low-budget...just when we have grown to expect more from these sorts of films.  (On the other hand, at least it doesn't exceed its grasp.)  Also, Freddie Highmore, a very talented young actor, is just not quite up to a convincing American accent, and this bothered me just a little throughout the film.

But on the other hand, watching the first moment when flowers in a flower bed turn into fairies is a true high-point...a moment of brief loveliness that sneaks up on you.  In fact, SPIDERWICK is a film of small pleasures throughout.  Little details, tiny touches...these are what you'll remember...long after the splattering of goblins and trolls.

1577499,4,B00005JPXS,"Condensing 5 books into one film can hurt storylines and make for lots of undeveloped characters. But the archetypes in Spiderwick are so familiar (like the abbreviated Potter movies) that it is less of a disadvantage than you would think. We, as objective movie viewers have to let go of the expectation for the Holy Grail of the perfect book-to-film translation and face that the mediums are apples and oranges. This is an easy task for me this time because I haven't read any of the Spiderwick series. But having said that, my children and I, enjoy the film. The look of the ""world"" created in the spirit of the books were originally stylized enough to make it a departure from the world of Hogwarts (which is no small accomplishment when you also have trolls and griffins.

Typical of the archetypes of the genre, you have the child-outsider of a broken (or bent) home who blunders into a magic world, along with quirky, sometimes ill-mannered, but ultimately well-meaning siblings and finally the single parent who doesn't believe a word-of it. The kid opens a  book he shouldn't (like who would read a book that has ""Do not open"" on the cover, it should have read: don't open infested with Lice!"" that would have kept `em out!) and then spends the film trying to make things right and bonding with his estranged family.

Production is pretty eye-candy using visual designers of the Henson school of creature making.  John Horner (the not-Williams) composes a face paced soundtrack that matches the speed of the story and slows appropriately of the sappier moments of the movie. The cast is a watchable bunch of not-overly attractive kids, along with some voice cameos like Martin Short and Nick Nolte, not without distinction, plays the badie (physically sometimes) well enough.

We enjoyed the film and, if there isn't higher praise than this let me know, we were inspired to check-out the Spiderwick Chronicles book series at our local library to fill in all the plot holes.",1203292800,18,1982,4.834808259587021

As an adult who hasn't read the books, I was confused and bored, despite the beautiful photography and music and the clever CGI effects.  There was nothing that drew me in or thrilled me.  I think it would have been better if the children had been younger; as teenagers, they looked too old to be cavorting with fairies and scared of goblins.  They didn't have enough charisma to make me care about them, and the wonderful David Strathairn was completely miscast as Spiderwick.  I think very young children would be scared by the scary creatures zooming around. Great title, but  not much here for adults.",1203206400,27,1185,5.617977528089888
1577501,4,B00005JPXS,"The Grace family moves into an old family estate, long uninhabited - or so they think. In fact the house has an inhabitant. More to the point, the woods around the house have their own trolls and gnomes, unfriendly ones, who want something that's inside the house.

So starts this kids' fantasy, with a big element of ""the grownups just don't get it."" In this case, young Jared not only finds that thing that the invisible ouside beings want, he also perceives their threat first. A kid-empowerment fantasy ensues, with the grownups (including a teen sister in a half-grownup kind of role) finally catching on just barely in time.

If you want a bit of fantasy without overt violence (or not much), and with people keeping their clothes on, you came to the right place. There's a suitably scary buildup at the end, with some great CGI effects like those toad-like outside beings. Maybe it's not memorable, but it's fun anyway.

1577503,4,B00005JPXS,"The Spiderwick Chronichles is one of the better recent fantasy movies based on a book series. It's about a boy named Jared Grace (Freddie Highmore) who moves into a house with his mom (Mary-Louise Parker), sister and twin brother ""who Highmore also plays of course"". Soon after he arrives he notices some strange things about the house, such as something living in the walls. When he starts poking holes in the walls his mom thinks it's over anger issues due to his father leaving them. So yes there's a sub-plot about divorces and him missing his father and wanting to live with him.

  The movie still sweeps you away though once he finds a mysterious book that holds all the mysteries of a hidden magical world. Soon after finding the book he meets who he heard behind the walls. He's warned by it not to ever leave the house with the book and that him and his family are in danger due to him even opening it. Soon after that goblins start coming after him and his family led by the evil Mulgarath (Nick Nolte).

  I liked Narnia but I found The Spiderwick Chronicles to be just as good as any of the Harry Potter movies. Just don't expect to be able to bring small kids because just like Potter, it's too intense for them. Moving on, this movie is magical and instantly became one of my new favorite fantasy films. It helps that the cast is pretty good. David Strathairn especially is solid as Arthur Spiderwick who's obsession with fairies and other creatures is what started all the trouble in the first place. Nick Nolte is pretty creepy when his character is shown in human form. While Seth Rogan is funny as the voice of a good creature who means to help Jared but loses sight of his goals whenever he spots a bird. One thing I just don't get though, if tomatoe sauce kills goblins, then would just throwing a tomatoe at a goblin kill it too or how about ketchup ? lol.",1203120000,3,1878,4.428985507246376
1577504,4,B00005JPXS,"Regardless of how faithful The Spiderwick Chronicles movie is to the original stories by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, the film is tremendously entertaining and thankfully resolute. Unlike the recent flock of fantasy epics including The Golden Compass and The Seeker, which conclude feeling wholly unsatisfactory due to an abrupt resolution that suggests further films in the series, The Spiderwick Chronicles easily stands alone as a complete story. With sensationally mirthful creature designs and likeable human characters, topped with state-of-the-art special effects, The Spiderwick Chronicles is another big win for Paramount and a high bar for family films of 2008.

The moment the Grace family moves into the dilapidated Spiderwick Estate, strange things begin to happen. Jared (Freddie Highmore) is a curious, adventurous boy who quickly seeks out the hidden cob-web-covered remains of great great uncle Arthur Spiderwick's laboratory. He unleashes a mysterious force when he locates a field guide full of the secrets of the magical creatures that inhabit the forest surrounding the mansion. His twin brother Simon is calm and reserved and very much the intellectual one, but is rapidly drawn into the fantastical world of faeries and goblins. Older sister Mallory and their mom are harder to convince, but after the almighty and ruthless ogre leader Mulgarath (Nick Nolte) begins to attack the home, everyone must band together to combat the hordes of goblins and ensorcelled creatures that lurk outside.

The Spiderwick Chronicles is, on the surface, an alluringly delightful fantasy that blends the very best of character designs, both human and CG, into a story that effortlessly engrosses without stumbling out of the realm of suspended disbelief. Everything within the story makes sense as it unfolds, and we don't question why certain things are feasible - because as the world of goblins and boggers is defined, we have no reason not to become completely immersed in the fantasy. Director Mark Waters doesn't rush the process of illustrating the multitude of magic and myths, and doesn't overload us with jargon that we couldn't possibly comprehend. The pacing is fantastic for a family film, and doesn't fall into the three hour trap that The Lord of the Rings sets.

The children have more appeal and charismatic personalities than those of the Narnia kids, and the creatures are more loveable and waggish than those in Harry Potter. Each computer animated monstrosity and cuddly ally beautifully blend into the forested environment, and never reach a level of utter annoyance. The designs themselves are ingenious, with a mix of gelatinous abominations like Redcap, the angry henchman goblin, a furry old hamster-like man (Thimbletack, voiced by Martin Short) who speaks in rhyme, and a mighty griffin that soars above the picturesque clouds. Eloquently wispy faeries and an enormous horned ogre are also substantial parts of the Spiderwick mythology, and many other exciting creatures frequent this action-filled fairyland.

The Spiderwick Chronicles undeniably makes fantasy and magic fun. While a few scenes of unnecessary predicaments involving the children's divorced parents could have been cut, the film manages not to be overly preachy, even with its many positive messages and abounding morals. With pleasing characters, family-friendly magical adventure and a mind-bogglingly fantastical world of faeries, goblins and ogres, The Spiderwick Chronicles is extraordinarily entertaining fantasy fun.

1577505,4,B00005JPXS,"I could use this review of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" as a platform to describe how different it is from the five books that inspired it, but why bother? After years of hearing it in college English classes, I've finally come to accept the adage that movies are not books, and books are not movies. As a film, ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is charming, magical, and a lot of fun, which is about what one would expect from a family-oriented fantasy film. The characters are compelling and the story is effectively simple and good-hearted, telling a tried and true story that an audience can willingly enjoy. I'm not so deluded as to think this an original story; the Reluctant Hero, the Magical Creatures, and the Fight Against Evil are all too familiar at this point. On the same token, I'm not so cold-hearted as to dismiss it entirely. This is, quite simply, an effective movie.

The story focuses on the Grace family and its bumpy transition into a new life, one that happens to include an adventure into a world of goblins, ogres, sprites, and brownies. The mom, Helen (Mary-Louise Parker), now a divorcee, moves with her children out of New York City and into the dilapidated former home of her great uncle, Arthur Spiderwick. Her teenage daughter, Mallory (Sarah Bolger), is headstrong, bossy, and a champion fencer. Her identical twin boys--Jared and Simon (both played by Freddie Highmore)--are polar opposites: Simon is a quiet pacifist who loves to read and connects with animals; Jared is angry, bitter, and rebellious, not only because his father left him, but also because he bears the brunt of his mother's anger. Adjusting to a new life won't be easy for him, especially since his new house looks like it was taken straight from the panels of a Charles Addams comic strip.

The adventure proper begins the very night they arrive. Jared immediately hears something scurrying in the walls, and after busting a wall open with a broomstick, he finds a dumbwaiter filled with various knickknacks (such as Mallory's fencing medal, which she believes he stole). He also finds a key. He then enters the dumbwaiter and pulls himself up to the attic, which contains a secret library coated in dust; in one corner sits a large chest, and lo and behold, the key fits into the lock. Jared unlocks it, opens the lid, and finds a book with a warning attached to the front, something about not opening the book because you'd risk your life doing so. He ignores it, of course, which is fine since there wouldn't be a story otherwise. Inside, Jared discovers that it's a field guide created by Arthur Spiderwick over eighty years ago, one that explains everything about the magical world around us with illustrations and notes.

At around this point, Jared discovers what's been scurrying through the walls: his name is Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short), an easily provoked brownie that loves honey and can only be seen if he wants you to see him. He's in a panic because Jared has discovered the book, and this will not do since Thimbletack's job was to protect it at any cost. Jared is learning more about the creatures that inhabit our world, namely that they can't be seen without a special ring-shaped stone. Thimbletack gives Jared the stone, and he looks through it in time to see Simon dragged off by a mean group of ugly ogres; the ensuing rescue attempt reveals that a powerful, shape shifting ogre named Mulgarath (voiced by Nick Nolte) wants Spiderwick's book for his own malevolent reasons.

This is pretty much the foundation for the journey, one that sees Mallory joining her brothers, a visit to their great aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright) in a mental institution, and a few sequences with Arthur Spiderwick himself (David Strathairn), a man who walks with a cane because it makes him look scholarly. We're also treated to a number of impressive visual effects, not the least of which have to do with a number of creatures that hide in plain sight. I especially liked the sprites that take the form of ordinary flowers--I'd love to walk through a park with such creatures floating around me. We also meet Hogsqueal (voiced by Seth Rogen), a hobgoblin that loves to eat birds, and a griffin named Byron, who flies majestically above clouds, over mountains, and through caves.

There was also an interesting subplot about the house itself. Apparently, it's surrounded by a ring of toadstools that act as a kind of force field; nothing magical can cross that line either way, meaning that the book is safe so long as it remains in the house. Jared, being the willful young lad he is, takes it with him wherever he goes, which is one of the reasons why Thimbletack is always so high-strung. Is it any wonder that his anger forces him into acts of mischief, such as tying Mallory's hair to the posts of her bed, or switching the field guide with a cookbook when Jared isn't looking?

As routine as this material is, all of it still manages to be wonderful, so much so that we don't stop to think about the film's weaker aspects, namely the tension and resentment growing between Jared and his mother. Then again, that too would have been unoriginal, since it's been explored so many times in so many other movies. Ultimately, what we really care about is the fight between the Graces and Mulgarath--or to more general, the fight between Good and Evil. The final confrontation has some nice subtleties that I wouldn't dream of giving away, not only because they're clever, but also because they're expected. I recommend ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" to everyone, even to diehard fans of the book series created by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black; it's an easy-going fantasy fable, about as enjoyable as a green pasture swarming with sprites.",1202947200,8,5746,4.798989898989899

1577857,1,B00005JPXS,"SPOILER ALERT

Nickelodeon must have paid the MPAA to rate this movie PG, because there is literally NO REASON why this movie shouldn't be at least PG-13. This is supposedly a kid's movie, but I must say it most DEFINITELY is not! The movie starts off with a mysterious, forboding feeling, then descends into basically horror-lite, with many hideous creatures attacking children who barely survive each encounter (including visible blood and wounds to one of the kids, NOT appropriate for a kids' movie!). There are only a few ""good"" creatures in the film, and even their appearance is disturbing at best.

We kept watching this movie thinking that it would get better at some point, that there would be some ray of light in an otherwise terror-filled plot, but it literally NEVER did. The children went from one terrifying, near-death encounter to another, with barely time to breathe in between. The main villain looks like a real demon from hell, and the point at which we HAD to stop watching was when the boy stabs his father in the chest, who then proceeds to grotesquely morph into the main demonic villain in a transformation that is every bit as terror-inducing as in the infamous ""American Werewolf in London"" transformation scene of horror movie lore, then proceeds to transform into a terrifying anaconda-type snake... what gives, Nickelodeon??? Really, a kid's movie???

There is literally NO EXCUSE for this movie to be marketed and billed as a children's movie! The MPAA should be sued for rating this PG. Due to the intense terror throughout the film, which virtually never lets up, this movie is completely inappropriate for children under 13. It really should have been PG-13 at the minimum, possibly even R for the grotesque creatures, especially the demonic main villain, and his hideous transformations which have far more in common with standard R-rated horror flicks than a ""children's movie"".

Even as an adult, I found little to enjoy about this movie.

1577858,1,B00005JPXS,"Blah.  Just blah.  Lackluster acting, unbelievable plot even for a kid's fantasy movie.  Redolent of the much much MUCH better Canterville Ghost, both from a film and a literary standpoint.  Of course it's really hard to be compared to Oscar Wilde but the movie itself is an awful lot like the remake of the original 30's movie - which was crap.  For no apparent reason, children are obnoxious to the point of juvenile delinquency.  The kids in this are SLIGHTLY better from a behavioral standpoint than the CG remake, but not a lot.  Stick to the book and pass on this forgettable waste of time.  Better yet, go for the much better Oscar Wilde story, and then pass on to the L'Engle Wrinkle in Time series of books (another fine set of novels that have consistently been maimed in film).

Its nice to catch a movie now and then thats not full of gratuitous sex and violence and theres enough action to keep you hooked until the end. I like Freddie Highmore in Bates Motel and wanted to catch his earlier work and he sounds and acts the same in this one and playing two roles was credible.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES [2008] is a fantasy film adaptation of Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi's bestselling book series of the same name. Set in the Spiderwick Estate in New England, it follows the adventures of Simon, Mallory, and Jared Grace as they discover a field guide to fairies and battle goblins and other magical creatures. It was directed by Mark Waters and stars Freddie Highmore, Sarah Bolger, Martin Short, Nick Nolte, and Seth Rogen.

THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES takes place in New England, United States, when young twins Simon Grace [Freddie Highmore] and Jared Grace [Freddie Highmore] and their older sister Mallory Grace [Sarah Bolger] move into the decrepit Spiderwick Estate. They discover a field guide to Faeries written by the house's previous owner, Arthur Spiderwick [David Strathairn], and soon begin to notice faeries throughout the estate. However, Mulgarath [Nick Nolte], a shape-shifting ogre, wants the field guide so that he can rule over all faerie-kind and possibly humans as well, and so attacks the children in an attempt to obtain it.

Mrs. Helen Grace [Mary-Louise Parker], recently divorced, wants a new start for her family, so the Grace family moves into the Spiderwick Estate when it is given to them by their elderly Great Aunt Lucinda Spiderwick [Joan Plowright], Arthur Spiderwick's daughter. Mallory Grace [Sarah Bolger] uncovers a dumbwaiter system behind a wall; in it, Jared Grace [Freddie Highmore] finds a monogrammed key, where he also discovers Arthur Spiderwick's study, and when he uses the key to open a chest, he finds Spiderwick's Field Guide. Although an attached note warns him not to read it, which of course he does so anyway.

Later, Jared Grace [Freddie Highmore] meets a brownie named Thimbletack [Voice of Martin Short], who explains that magical creatures are normally invisible but can reveal themselves at will. He tells Jared about a protective circle that Arthur Spiderwick placed around the house and gives him a stone with a hole which allows him to see faeries. Simon Grace [Freddie Highmore], mistaken for Jared Grace [Freddie Highmore], is kidnapped by the Mulgarath goblins, while Jared Grace [Freddie Highmore] meets Hogsqueal [Voice of Seth Rogen], a hobgoblin who gives Jared the ability to see all faeries without the aid of the stone. With the help of Mallory Grace [Sarah Bolger], the twins escape from the goblins into the house.

Jared Grace [Freddie Highmore] and Mallory Grace [Sarah Bolger] visit their Great Aunt Lucinda Spiderwick [Joan Plowright] for advice. She tells them that only one person can help them and that is Arthur Spiderwick [David Strathairn]. However, he was ""rescued"" by the Sylphs, a type of faerie, when goblins attacked, and they will not allow him to return because they desire his knowledge. Great Aunt Lucinda Spiderwick [Joan Plowright] tells them that they must find her father and have him destroy the book. Suddenly, Mulgarath's goblins attack them and manage to steal several pages from the book before they are driven off.

Inside, written in Arthur Spiderwick's own hand, is a primer to a magical universe that exists, invisible, all around us. While his uncle speaks of befriending many of the otherworldly creatures there, he also warns that a malevolent, shape-shifting ogre known as Mulgarath seeks the knowledge to be found within the book's pages and plans on using it to enslave both the magical and the human realm. Soon the Grace children's eyes are opened to the fantastic truths within the book and the enchanted creatures that inhabit the Spiderwick Estate alongside them. It isn't long before Mulgarath and his goblin army turn all their dark energies to wresting the book from the house and destroying all inside its walls.

It should come as no surprise that the film THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES is being executive produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, the husband and wife team responsible for most of Steven Spielberg's most enduring films. No surprise, because THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES directed by Mark Waters, is rife with Spielbergian touchstones and a dysfunctional family, an absent father, a supernatural world stocked with fantastical creatures seeping into our own, childlike wonderment, and an imminent confrontation that can be won only by the innocent might of a child.

Director Mark Waters impressively balance both the reality and the fantasy elements in THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES, creating a world suffused with daunting adventure, considerable humour and touching humanity. The lively CGI computer generated images of the sprites, hobgoblins, trolls and slobbering ogres mesh seamlessly with the film's naturalistic look, and superb cinematography. James Horner turns in the sort of pitch perfect fantasy film music scores, for which he is always famous for. THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES is an enjoyable adventure fantasy that is sure to cast a spell over its audiences. But just as importantly, it weaves a story that resonates with spiritual truth and humanity, and is more-than-worthy entertainment, a classic adventure with its heart and its sense of whimsy in all the right places.

Blu-ray Image Quality  Paramount Pictures has once again done a really superb stunning job in presenting this Blu-ray disc with a beautiful transfer that brings the fantastical world described by the story to life. The transfer is encoded using maximum resolution of 1080p and presented in the film's theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The transfer is absolutely clean and devoid of any encoding errors or colour balancing issues. There is an excellent level of detail in the images and the sharpness and depth of the pictures gives the film an almost 3D look. Seeing that this is a pretty recent production, one should expect the best picture quality from this transfer and Paramount has delivered. Colours are spot on, with natural skin tones and nice saturation and not too high a contrast. Black levels are accurate and although some softness does rear its ugly head, this issue is so minute that one might not ever realise it.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Paramount Pictures provides us with a next-generation 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround Sound audio track presentation, but when a certain actor speaks I had to really crank the sound up, especially with the actor Freddie Highmore. The surround channels do come alive during the course of the film but they seem to be held back for some reason or another. The viewer could certainly feel the immersive effects of some of the action-oriented scenes but the quieter scenes sound pretty lacklustre, devoid of any life or ambience. Apart from that slight disappointment, the other aspects of the audio mix are pretty good, with crystal clear dialogue and the speakers used to good effect.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: It's All True! [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:04] Here we get introduced to director Mark Waters and takes us through the source material for the film via the novel and the challenges the filmmakers faced when translating it to film. We also get to see behind Mark Waters some wonderful colourful artistic illustration, as well as the brilliant colourful sketches of the fantastic creatures we see in the film. We get to see the actual beautiful rare leather bound Arthur Spiderwicks Field Guide. Mark Waters also introduce us to the fantastic creatures that appear in the film, which include Thimbletack; Hogsqueal; Ogre Mulgarath; Redcap; Troll and Byron the Griffin. This special feature also serves as an introduction to the Fantastical World of THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES.

Special Feature: Its A Spiderwick World! [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:44] Here the authors of the books explain how the story came to them, and how eventually the picture made it to the screen. The themes of the fantasy film and other aspects of pre-production are covered here as well. We get lots of rare behind-the-scene filming. Contributors include: Holly Black [Co-creator/Illustrator/Executive Producer], Tony DiTerlizzi [Co-creator/Illustrator/Executive Producer], Kathleen Kennedy [The Kennedy/Marshall Company], Mark Waters [Director], Mark Canton [Producer] and Karey Kirkpatrick [Producer/Screenwriter].

Special Feature: Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide In-Movie Mode:  With this Blu-ray disc it is a Java based In-Movie version of the Field Guide that will pop-up descriptions of the various creatures, during the film being viewed. It is also essentially a trivia track that is activated, and will pop up during viewing the film and the viewer can also access the field guide when prompted on-screen information. This is really fantastic, because you get to see some wonderful illustration from the Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide and you also get to see some of the amazing CGI computer generated creatures.

Special Feature: Spiderwick: Meet the Clan! [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [13:54] Here we are introduced to the cast of the film, featuring interviews with all of the actors who play the film's main characters. Contributors include: Mark Waters [Director], Freddie Highmore [Jared/Simon], Kathleen Kennedy [The Kennedy/Marshall Company], Mary-Louise Parker [Helen], Karey Kirkpatrick [Producer/Screenwriter], Sarah Bolger [Mallory], David Strathairn [Arthur Spiderwick], Andrew McCarthy [Richard], Kevin Yagher [Special Effects Makeup Technician] and Seth Rogen [Hogsqueal].

Special Feature: Making Spiderwick! [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [20:53] With this special feature we get a rare look behind-the-scenes at all the set building in the film studio and how amazing and brilliant the sets look. We also get informed that the actual Spiderwick house was actually built for the film and when they finished filming Rangers moved into the house to live. But when they filmed the interior of the house, this was done on film stage set and so realistic it all looks Tony DiTerlizzi informs us that he would love to have lived in it permanently if it had been real, and you see what a good job they did. When you see behind-the-scene location shooting, it was filmed in the wettest season in Montreal in Canada and caused lots of logistic problems. We also get a look behind-the-scene recording with the large orchestra and composer James Horner conducting. We also get to meet the cast and crew discuss making the picture with a fairly well balanced overview of the process. Contributors include: Holly Black [Co-creator/Illustrator/Executive Producer], Kathleen Kennedy [The Kennedy/Marshall Company], James Bissell [Production Designer], Mark Waters [Director], Caleb Deschanel, A.C.S. [Director of Photography], Meinert Hansen [Illustrator], Tony DiTerlizzi [Co-creator/Illustrator/Executive Producer], Sarah Bolger [Mallory], Freddie Highmore [Jared/Simon], Karey Kirkpatrick [Producer/Screenwriter], Claire Alary [Property Master], Phil Tippett [Creature Supervisor], Pablo Helman [Visual Effects Supervisor for ILM], Dave McKeown [Stunt Coordinator], Mary-Louise Parker [Helen], Michael Lantieri [Special Effects Supervisor] and James Horner [Composer].

Special Feature: The Magic of Spiderwick! [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [14:23] Here we are introduced to director Mark Waters who talks about the process of going through the massive post-production of producing CGI computer generated creatures and talks about the fantastic talented people who worked on the film and the work that went into making the fantasy setting come alive. The Tippett Studio CGI computer team discuss post production, especially the CGI computer generated effects. While Mark Waters is talking to the camera, we see behind him all the weird and wonderful computer generated creatures you see in the film, but behind a black background. You also see the Tippett Studio CGI computer team working on producing the creatures. We also get to view the amazing Tony DiTerlizzi colourful creature illustrations, which were of course used as the basic design for the finished amazing creatures that were finally produced by CGI computer generated images. We see the rough computer animation for the humming sprite motion study and the Mulgarath prototype model design. Contributors include: Mark Waters [Director], Phil Tippett [Creatire Supervisor], Pablo Helman [Visual Effects Supervisor from ILM], Michael Brunet [Lead Animator for Tippett Studio], Joel Friesch [Visual Effects Supervisor for Tippett Studio], Russell Darling [CGI Supervisor for Tippett Studio], Tim Alexander [Visual Effects Supervisor for ILM], Christian Alzmann [Visual Effects Art Director for ILM], Tim Harrington [Animation Supervisor for ILM] and Jim Bolte [Lead Digital Artist for ILM].

Special Feature: A Final Word of Advice! [2008] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:51] Director Mark Waters makes a return to remind us that this world really exists. Mark Waters simply reminds us that everything in the film is totally real, so we had better keep an eye out for those crazy and weird creatures.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2008] [1080p] [2.35:1] [8:14] Here we get to view four deleted scenes that consist of Mom & Jared; Boys in Bedroom; Messy Kitchen and Meet Lucinda. As usual you can either watch then separately or Play All.

Nickelodeon TV Spots [2008] [1080i] [1.33:1] [5:04] Here we get to view nine original TV adverts relating to the film  THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES that ran on the Nickelodeon cable television network and they are as follows: A Guide to Seeing The Spiderwick Chronicles; Cinema Spy; Confessional Jared; Confessional Mallory; Field Guide  Tomato Sauce; Field Guide  Seeing Stone; Field Guide  Creatures; What if You Had a Seeing Stone and The Spit Stone. As usual, you can either watch them separately or Play All.

Theatrical Trailers: Here we get to view two Original Theatrical Trailers for the film THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES. Good v. Evil [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:03] and Secrets [2008] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:32]. To view them, you have to watch them separately. One bonus is that they are shown in 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound.

Finally, THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES is a very entertaining fun filled fantasy film and far more entertaining than the usual similar children's fantasy films that are available these days. But I must point out to Parents that this film has some very intense and extremely scary scenes that might frighten young children and especially viewing it in the superlative 1080p high definition transfer, because all the creatures look so totally life like, that children might believe they are real. If you are keen on the fantasy film, then to my mind this is definitely worthy to own in your very own Blu-ray disc collection, then this is the way you will want to watch this truly magical fantasy film time after time. Very Highly Recommended!

1577945,2,B00005JPXS,"I bought a two DVD Blu-Ray package with The Spiderwick Chronicles and Stardust. Stardust is about three witches trying to cut the heart out of a princess to eat it and be young again. Clearly not for children but at least it's rated PG-13. The Spiderwick Chronicles on the other hand is rated PG. I looked up reviews before letting my grandkids see it and it looked OK for kids under 10. Wrong!! The beginning of the move was very uncomfortable with all the bickering between the kids and their mother. It went down hill from there. Hoards of vicious creatures trying to kill kids to get a book (and they would kill the kids even if they got the book) lots of violence and implied violence. At one point a kid even stabs his ""father"" (who turns out to be the monster) but my kids were upset by that. Also, the head monster is probably the ugliest, most terrifying devil creature I've ever seen in movies!  (Google ""spiderwick movie monster), All in all, I was very sorry I let my kids see the movie and wouldn't have done it had I known. My wife left n the middle of it. I will keep Stardust to watch for adults but Spiderwick is not a movie that needs to be seen, by adults or especially children. PG?  Ridiculous!",1505001600,,1215,4.348017621145375

1577990,5,B00005JPXS,"This movie is almost ten years old, so most of the young cast has moved on to bigger and better things (hopefully). The star of the movie is young Freddie Hightower, who plays a duel role as both twin boys, Jared and Simon Grace. After their parents separate, they and their older sister Mallory, played by Sarah Bolger, are taken by their mother to live in an old house that was once owned by their great aunt. Upon exploring the house, Jared finds a book that was written by their great aunt's father, and which turns out to be a vast store of knowledge about the world of magical creatures. Unfortunately, an ogre named Mulgarath is desperate to get the book for himself, for the knowledge contained in its pages will allow him to take over the world. This set of circumstances sets Jared and his siblings off on a series of adventures to protect the book from Mulgarath and to save their family. Many will probably remember Freddie Hightower from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" where he played Charlie Bucket opposite Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka. Within the last few years he has played a number of roles, including a young Norman Bates in the television series ""Bates Motel,"" and he does an excellent job here as two boys who may look alike but have totally different personalities.
 While this movie was panned by some critics when it first came out for relying too heavily on special effects, this is a story that has as some of its central characters ogres, trolls, hobgoblins, and one brownie that suffers from anger management issues, so I really don't know what the critics were thinking they were going to see but a bunch of computer animated magical creatures. These creatures are voiced by a stellar cast, including Martin Short, Seth Rogan, and Ron Perlman. Rounding out the cast are Nick Nolte as Mulgarath and Mary-Louise Parker as the disbelieving mother. The whole thing turns into a fast-paced romp of an adventure that will delight adults as well as children, and I would highly recommend it for an afternoon with the grandkids.",1503532800,2,2053,4.73463687150838

This seems like a film where the writer thought ""well this worked before, should work for me as well.""  Nothing very original about the writing or the special effects.  The soundtrack keeps going from thundering music to low speech so I was constantly having to adjust my speakers.  Rather a meh film altogether.",1491436800,2,442,4.701298701298701

Nothing at the start of this movie indicates that  (Jared?) is a brat, but he gets blamed for Everything, even when we watched the sister do it. I am sure that at some point he will bear the blame for Spiderwick being abducted and the great aunt being institutionalized, that's how badly treated this kid is.

1579113,5,B00005JPXS,My children beg to watch Spiderwick Chronicles several times a day. There is just enough 'scare' to keep them excited but not terrified. As a parent watching it there are some inconsistencies in plot information but it is very well done and only annoying if you care about everything in a fantasy movie adding up!,1485388800,,313,4.709090909090909

BUT, I cannot stand all of the angry, mean bickering between siblings and mom, and the blatant disrespect towards mom...whoa...

They could have toned that down drastically and it would have been a MUCH better movie!!!

Needless to say, I don't let my kids watch it much at all... the kids are horrible examples!

The books are WAY Better.",1485302400,3,371,4.841269841269841

1579209,4,B00005JPXS,"Great little tale--but be careful because it might be a bit creepy for the really young ones so keep that in mind.  Freddie Highmore did an excellent job playing both of the brothers in this film. The end was kind of predictable (but what teen oriented shows aren't?) but it still kept you in suspense. I liked it a lot--the only reason for not getting five is that the content is a little strong at times (violence-wise)--but not extremely so.  If you enjoyed Nanny McPherson, you'll like this one.",1485302400,,499,4.595505617977528

1580107,5,B00005JPXS,"Truly a film worth watching for kids--say about 7 and up--and for this adult anyway! I seem to have retained at least some vestige of  the fabulous imagination I had as a child and teen tho I didn't know it til last night when I watched this wonderful movie. I found myself saying to myself in my head--""I do believe in fairies, ! do believe in fairies, etc""! I went on a serious hunt for ""The Borrowers"" in the 8th grade--it's nice to know that imagination (at 60+ y.o, no less!) is still buried and functioning somewhere deep in my brain! Joan Plowright's appearance (since the onset of her completely going blind due to macular degeneration a couple years back she is sorely missed by this HUGE fan of all her work) is altogether too brief, but wonderful. Freddie Highmore once again proves what a creative and believable young actor he is and Mary Louise Parker was also quite good--",1484092800,3,887,4.54375

1580654,2,B00005JPXS,"Wow I could not believe how bad this movie was. I've never read the books, but I'm a fan of fantasy adventure and old scary houses so I gave it a shot on Prime Video. Twenty minutes in, I could not find a single character to root for or relate to and none of them feel believable through the stilted words of the obviously rushed script. The main boy just comes off as obnoxious and his sudden transformation to accept the faery world is not setup well. Rather none of the scenes are. By the time the viewer realizes the director intended to convey an important event, they're beat over the head again with another hideous, sub-par creature CG animation; or another under delivered line; or another ugly shot meant to hide the fact that there is one boy playing the twin brothers. The editing is haphazard as one disparate scene smears into the next and another plot hole develops (why on earth did he take the book with him after the little man told him not to?).

Turned it off mid-way. Disappointed.",1483488000,,1002,4.475409836065574

1580698,5,B00005JPXS,"A good series for the older child due to some of the more intense scenes. The story has some striking similarities to Harry Potter but then most fantasy stories are based on Good vs Evil and there are only so many ways to present the story line.
The first book, The Field Guide, was published in 2003 and then followed by The Seeing Stone (2003), Lucinda's Secret (2003), The Ironwood Tree (2004), and The Wrath of Mulgarath (2004). Several companion books have been published including Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You (2005), Notebook for Fantastical Observations (2005), and Care and Feeding of Sprites (2006). A second series, entitled Beyond the Spiderwick Chronicles includes The Nixie's Song (2007), A Giant Problem (2008), and The Wyrm King (2009).

We would like to have been able to give it 4.5 stars, because we thought there were some moments when the directing could have been just a bit better.  But, we are pretty picky about that kind of thing, and we really, really enjoyed this movie.  So, we didn't feel it was fair to give it only four stars.  Therefore, five stars it is!

1581916,4,B00005JPXS,"This was a fun movie with a lot of magic and fictional creatures. A kids movie, definitely G maybe PG. I was looking for something to watch while taking a long flight, and it's kind of Harry Potter type of movie.  The plot is silly, but fun.  The actors and actresses do a good job.  I would recommend it for kids or people that are just stuck in a boring situation, and are wary of the people around them.",1481328000,,406,4.113924050632911

1582104,5,B00005JPXS,this was an excellent movie and although it gave me a fear 'jolts' it would probably be fine for a family gathering that included kids age 8 and up - younger if they have watched movies with goblins and fairy tale critters before without having 'bad dreams or nightmares'.  It is a movie that highlights sticking together as a family and how the least likely persons can truly be allies and show true heroism and faith in the most dire situations.,1481155200,,447,4.518518518518518

The backstory effectively sets the stage, and the family is well-cast with believable characters, each heroic and flawed in his or her own way. The faerie creatures of the wood are funny, fanciful, and frightful with admirable special effects lending to their believability. The pace increases at a steady rate and ends with an exciting and satisfying climax. My wife, kids and I have watched this together about three times now over the years.

1582478,5,B00005JPXS,"I love this movie. It's both a great fantasy, and a realistic family story, sibling arguments, mom searching for patience, etc. The house is inherited from a ""crazy old aunt"" who had to be moved into a home. Her father (the great uncle) had been a scientist, and he had been studying the creatures. He also wrote his notes into a book which has all the secret knowledge about the good guys. Including how to kill them.
The fantasy creatures (the good guys) are hilarious & adorable. The house comes with a very protective (troll??) who's sole purpose is to protect the book, The bad guys (mostly trolls) were suitably ugly, making it very obvious that they were definitely the bad guys.
I really enjoy the movie, & I've watched it many times  and I don't even have the ""excuse"" that it's for my son, as he's now 23, lol!
 While it's a great movie about family, I'd be hesitant letting a child under 8-9 watch it. It's intense in some places, and is kinda scary in a few scenes as well.",1480377600,14,985,4.406593406593407

1582611,5,B00005JPXS,"Everything about this fantasy film is top notch, though I found it was made for a younger audience than I had expected. I had though it would be more of a Harry Potter kind of film but it was more like Bridge To Teribithia or The Neverending Story. This largely comes down to the scariness being turned down, largely by the fact that most of the bad creatures are rather silly-looking  and are led by what looks like a frog in an H.M.S.Pinafore uniform. Oddly, the ogre character in his true form is a pretty hideous thing and one scene of violence seems a little too over the top for little ones.

Still, once you're past the age-group issue, this joint venture by Paramount and Nickelodeon is a real winner for the whole family. Everyone involved in its making was an absolute pro and it shows in every way. The director was Mark Waters, who was well-experienced in films for young people having made Mean Girls and Freaky Friday. The non-child actors are a bunch of A-listers even when unknowns could have sufficed. Dame Joan Plowright is the dear old aunt who you wish had had more screen time. Nick Nolte is the ogre in many forms, one his own. Mary-Louise Parker is the mother who has no idea what is going on. David Stratham and Andrew McCarthy appear in brief roles and imaginary creatures are voiced by Seth Rogan and Martin Short.

Most amazing is young teen Freddie Highmore playing both twin brothers Jared and Simon Grace, bringing enough to each role that they seem truly different characters and not just one actor with different hair styles. I didn't find this out until later and simply assumed twin actors were cast in the roles. Sarah Bolger is good as the older sister who helps deal with the strange events unfolding.  The score is by James Horner and goes well with the events onscreen. The effects were by Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic and are important in giving the film an incredible look. Along with the lighting and cinematography, it give the film the look of a particularly beautifully-illustrated storybook come to life.

It goes by quickly in a little over ninety minutes. Considering it's adapted from a multi-book series it's a surprise (and a relief) that the producers didn't try to make it into a trilogy and gave it a decidedly firm ending.",1479427200,,2282,4.638613861386139
1582612,5,B00005JPXS,"This story line is great fun combined with lots of imagination.  The kids are typical kids growing up in today's world and old enough to figure out puzzles with logic and curiosity which gets them into some super difficult situations.  I loved the old house they went to live in with all the furnishings of the past when it was a great mansion and the odd characters that keep popping up everywhere.  The magic book is something to be protected and what happens in between the beginning and end of this story will put you on edge, make you laugh, and then sigh with relief.  Great picture for kids as well as adults.",1479427200,,616,4.424778761061947

1583737,4,B00005JPXS,"I went into this not knowing anything and, even as an adult, found it very enjoyable. It is engaging, creative, and though you can expect a happy ending, you never feel as if you know how events will play out (if you hadn't read the books, of course). Though I can't say that this film was on par with the highest-quality films in the genre, it still holds its own and would have been worth seeing in a theater.

If I were a parent, I would think twice about allowing any child under nine or ten see this only because it would be likely to give them nightmares.",1477699200,,561,4.194444444444445

I assume such things are taken into account in a full on fantasy world, but when the narrative is about how fantasy things exist in the real world but we mostly don't see them, I feel this should be addressed.

Which is to say- this movie is forgettable enough that I was thinking about home insurance.",1477526400,,437,4.531645569620253

1583883,4,B00005JPXS,"As with most movies, they don't follow the story line of the books exactly. However, the story line is not bad and explains what is going on well. The acting is not horrendous due to the more experienced actors in the film. But the constant barrage of teenager yelling and screaming did get a little old despite that being what a teenager does now a days. The creatures being computerized were also an interesting spectacle. They were not overly cheesy and fit in with their surroundings without standing out. Overall, it is a good movie to watch and high quality. Only reason it is not five stars is because some lines and characterization could use some work.",1477267200,,661,4.6581196581196584

1585825,5,B00005JPXS,My 7 year old and 10 year old great-grandchildren came for a weekend visit with Grandma. Since they are brother and sister they usually fight about what to watch. I had already watched the trailer before hand and knew immediately that they would both love this movie--and they did! It was like a fairy tale to them but not a cartoon. The 10 year old thinks he is too big to watch cartoons now and that is what the fights are usually about. Since it was such a magical type movie it fascinated both of them. I could not have picked a better movie for us to watch together.,1475107200,24,571,4.247706422018348

1586371,2,B00005JPXS,"This is an entertaining movie, but the book is much better (which is often the case).  While it is a great story and the special effects are fun, the acting is quite mediocre, even from the known actors.  It feels as if the cast isn't engaged.  I was happy to watch it for free, but I don't think I would bother paying for it.",1474848000,,326,4.0625
1586372,2,B00005JPXS,"It's a very interesting story line.  Didn't love the portrayal of the father leaving the family for another lady.  It was too fantasy built for young children.  My kids were frightened by the dark dark characters of the movie.  I wouldn't recommend for any children under the age of 12.  It's too much for little kids.
The shape shifter part with the bad guy posses like the boys estranged father then the boy stabbing the bad guy with a knife.. way too much gore.  Could have done without the stabbing.",1474848000,,503,4.533333333333333

1586434,5,B00005JPXS,"Despite the short length of the film, enough was packed in quick succession to convey the magical character of the movie. The computer graphics help a lot in presenting goblins, elves, an ogre and a griffin, to name a few, in a realistic fashion. Kids over 8 should love it. 4 1/2 stars",1474848000,,286,4.415094339622642
1586435,5,B00005JPXS,This is an adult friendly movie that is a good watch for children.  This movie could very well entice your children and grandchildren to read the Spiderwick chronicles books.

1588928,5,B00005JPXS,"I really liked the story line and the actors and the special effects, IMO the only draw back was a minor one. The young actor, male, is still improving, which is better than not improving. I remember when he was whispering his lines which I found distracting, but now he is learning to project his voice which I find a great improvement over his previous work. So I am giving this a 5 star based on story line and over all acting by what I consider the best cast for the part. A very entertaining imaginary movie. Very well done. Thank yoiu",1473465600,,540,4.303921568627451
1588929,2,B00005JPXS,"After reading the series, my children and I decided to watch the movie.  We were sadly disappointed.  It was extremely difficult to sit through the many differences, especially loving the series as we did.  It did not follow the book at all.  The few similarities were vague and sporadic.  The attempts at humor sadly missed the mark.  If you have not read the books and do not intend to - then watch this.  If you have read the books, it will be disappointing and ruin the story to say the least.",1473465600,,497,4.395604395604396

Not a bad movie, made by Nickelodeon, although seemed to want to have a Harry Potter kinda feel with some of the goblins and such.  The main thing i didn't care for, and it's from a person preference, the use of some language that i would prefer my kids not to learn to say.  Other than that, it kept everyone's attention and everyone would watch again.

It does the family part really well and realistically (there is no ""happily ever after"" in it though). It can be on the scary side for the littler ones though, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The action is a bit over the top, but we're talking fantasy so can it really be over the top? The visuals are gorgeous. I liked it and would have no trouble letting little people see it as long as I am there with them.

1589971,4,B00005JPXS,"If you're hoping to sell a best-selling children's series of fantasy books, it helps to have ""Chronicles"" in the title, along with the word ""Spider"" to conjure up images of all sorts of nasty, hairy, multi-legged creatures.  That's what Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi probably figured when they began their best-selling book series, ""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" and it worked out pretty well.

Of course, ""The Spiderwick"" tales are more exciting and adventurous than anything dear, sweet Ms. Fyleman ever wrote all those many years ago, but the Black-DiTerlizzi books probably took some inspiration there.  The ""Spiderwick"" stories are imaginative fun, derivative, to be sure, but amusing and entertaining and just a little bit scary by turns, at least for kids.  Fortunately, the new high-definition transfer should please viewers of any age, since both the Blu-ray picture and sound are as good as most people could want.

The only minor fly in the ointment is that in terms of story and characters, the 2008 ""Spiderwick Chronicles"" movie is not quite as magical for grown-ups as it might be.  Unlike ""Stardust"" and ""The Lord of the Rings,"" for instance, which were fantasies for adults that children could enjoy, or ""Enchanted"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" which were fantasies for children that adults could enjoy, ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is more or less geared for children, period.  Not that oldsters can't enjoy it, too, especially for its high-def sights and sounds; they just might not find the story and characters quite as sophisticated as they'd like.

Given that the authors and filmmakers aimed ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" mainly at children, it isn't so important that it be entirely original.  The fact is, the movie hasn't an original bone in its body, which is neither here nor there insofar as it might concern kids.  Unless they've grown up on a steady diet of fantasy, most of what goes on in ""Spiderwick"" will seem new and fresh.  Or it will seem only vaguely like stories they've read or seen before.

Here's the familiar setup:  a mother, deciding to start life over after her husband leaves her, takes her young twin sons and teen-aged daughter to live in a big, old, spooky-looking house in the country (a house that intentionally reminds one of the Addams family mansion).  The house used to belong to the children's great, great uncle, Arthur Spiderwick, who disappeared mysteriously some eighty years before.  According to Spiderwick's daughter, sylphs came and carried him off to a mysterious land, perhaps the Kingdom of Fairie, to protect him.  Not surprisingly, the authorities carted the daughter off to a sanitorium, where she's been residing ever since.

Not more than a few minutes after being in the house, one of the twins discovers noises in the walls, along with personal items going missing.  After that, he finds his uncle's old journal, ""Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You,"" and begins reading it.  There, he discovers that his uncle learned how to view and contact the unseen creatures of the woods--the sprites, goblins, hobgoblins, ogres, trolls, fairies, boggarts, griffins, sylphs, and other such beings.  Worse, he learns that the king of the goblins is out to get the ""Field Guide"" because learning its secrets will enable him to rule the world!

It isn't long before the whole family become involved up to their eyebrows in conflict with the mystical entities.

The family are the Graces, and they are the stereotypes you'd expect in such a story.  The mother, Helen (Mary-Louise Parker), is edgy and upset at her husband leaving her.  She just wants to get as far away from him as possible, even though the children want them to get back together.  Naturally, she refuses to believe anything the kids tell her about goblins and such and comes off as a typically uncaring adult who refuses to listen to her kids.  Young audiences will empathize.

The twins, Simon and Jared (Freddie Highmore of ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" playing both roles) are opposites of one another.  Simon is sweet and gentle and distant and intellectual.  He says he's a pacificist, and he's the darling of the family.  Jared is angry, outgoing, and always getting into trouble.  When things start disappearing, he's the one the others blame.  He's also the main character in the story, and we can see where this is going.  Highmore does a good job portraying the contrary personalities.

The teenage daughter, Mallory (Sarah Bolger), is several years older than the twins and won't let them forget it.  She's a know-it-all, above childish things, and wants as little to do with her brothers as possible.  She also studies fencing, which comes in handy as the story progresses.

The father, Richard (Andrew McCarthy), we hardly ever see, but the children refer to him often.  OK, you can see where this is heading, too.  A monumental strife must bring the family together, since as we all know from our own moviegoing experiences, it is only by working together on huge problems that characters come to know and love each other.  And so it goes.

Several other big-name actors fill out supporting roles.  David Strathairn plays the eccentric Arthur Spiderwick, partly in flashback, partly in the Kingdom of Fairie.  He's always fun to be with but seems slightly ill at ease in the role.  Nick Nolte plays Mulgarath, the ogre who rules the Goblin Kingdom, and, frankly, we don't see enough of him.  Martin Short and Seth Rogen voice the CGI creatures Thimbletack and Hogsqueal, names right out of the J.K. Rowling handbook of giddy appellations.

For me, though, the standout is Joan Plowright as Aunt Lucinda, Arthur Spiderwick's daughter, now eighty-seven years old and living in what the kids call a ""nut house.""  When she's on-screen, which is all too little, the whole movie springs to life with her casual and endearing grace.

There are some exciting and even frightening parts to ""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" maybe more so for youngsters than for adults, which go far in carrying the action along at a steady pace.  More important, there are some touching scenes as well, which help temper the narration and ensure that this isn't just another juvenile fantasy/action adventure.

It takes a while before the appearance of the first fantastical creature, but when we first see Thimbletack, it is magical, indeed.  James Horner's appropriately gentle and heroic musical score (a score that never gets too drippy, by the way) supports things along the way, as does Industrial Light & Magic's creature-design team.

Department of Useless Information:  Tomato juice kills goblins.  You never know when that will come in handy; but, remember, goblins are stupid creatures and relentless, so don't get overconfident.  Of more importance, the movie is 97 minutes long, not 101 minutes as the keep case announces.  And according to IMDb, there is a 107-minute unrated version available someplace.  Just not here.

Video:
I was greatly impressed by the video quality of the standard-definition edition, and this Blu-ray high-def version is, naturally, even better.  As before, we get a wide, 2.35:1-ratio, this time in a MPEG4/AVC, 1080p, BD50 transfer.  I loved the colors, which are extremely natural, never too bright, too gaudy, or too dull, just perfectly realistic.  I also liked the object definition, although it seemed a bit soft, with faces a little too smooth.  Needless to say, the screen is ultra-clear, showing very little grain, maybe even less than was in the original print; I don't know for sure because even though I also saw this film in a theater, I can't recall the detail level.  Dark scenes, though, are far more revealing in HD than they were in standard def.

Audio:
As befitting a fantasy film in high definition, the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack provides a multitude of surround effects, starting with the subtle sounds of the woods, crickets, wind, and the rustle of leaves.  Then, with the first entrance of Mulgarath, the lossless audio really comes into its own, with all the things that go bump in the night emanating from just about everywhere in the listening area.  Yet the noises seem cleaner and more finely nuanced than in regular Dolby Digital, tighter and more refined, making the dynamic impact appear all the stronger.

Extras:
The extras on the Blu-ray edition duplicate the extras on the two-disc standard-def set, with the addition of an enhanced in-movie version of ""Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide.""  Here, you'll find special notes throughout the movie, and when you see them you can leave the movie and go to the ""Field Guide"" for further information.  Or you can go directly to the ""Field Guide"" and click on each of the magical creatures listed and get text descriptions of them as well as a look at them from the movie.  Next up, is the seven-minute featurette, ""Spiderwick: It's All True!,"" in which the director introduces us to the ""Field Guide"" and to the fantastical creatures of the story.  Next, there is the nine-minute featurette, ""It's a Spiderwick World!"" in which the books' authors explain where they got their story ideas.  After that, there's the longest featurette in the set, the twenty-one-minute ""Spiderwick: Meet the Clan!""  Here we meet the various cast members and get some behind-the-scenes peeks at why the filmmakers chose them and how the cast prepared for their roles.  Of course, the director cannot help himself from referring to the story as a ""Hero's Journey,"" and thank you Joseph Campbell.  Then, there is the fourteen-minute featurette ""Making Spiderwick!"" in which we learn more about the sets, costumes, and locations of the ""Spiderwick"" world.  Following that is the fourteen-minute featurette ""The Magic of Spiderwick!"" about the CGI animation in the film.  Then the director returns for a quick, two-minute summing up in ""A Final Word of Advice...""

The bonus materials conclude with four deleted scenes, totaling about eight minutes; a series of Nickelodeon TV spots; two widescreen theatrical trailers; twelve scene selections; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  Incidentally, the keep case says that most of the extras are in high definition.  However, Paramount transferred them to disc in an MPEG2 codec, and they aren't in the best HD I've ever seen.

Parting Thoughts:
As I've said, the authors and filmmakers have geared ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" primarily for children, and as such the movie seems to me quite effective.  There may be a few scenes that are a bit intense for the youngest audience members, but overall it should please kids well enough.  For adults, the movie can work, too.  Although it's not particularly innovative, it is long on charm, which should carry it a fair way with many older folk.  I've enjoyed it each of the times I've  seen it now, starting with its theatrical run through this BD edition, but maybe I'm still a kid.",1434758400,,11060,5.046831955922865

1590928,5,B00005JPXS,"As a fantasy fiction author myself, I'm a pretty tough judge of movies in this genre. This movie is particularly well done, with great energy, enthusiastic young actors, and special effects that enhance but do not overwhelm the movie. It builds on common themes today - loss of father being painful at any age and in any century, being the ""oddball"" kid, and having to push ahead despite the naysayers. Seasoned with humor, plenty of action, and the right blend of tension and excitement, I highly recommend this movie. - Author Claudia Newcorn",1388016000,,544,4.860215053763441

1590930,3,B00005JPXS,It was not as I expected as I bought it for my 3 year old grandson and it is too scarey for him at his age. Maybe is a couple years he can watch it.  I would buy other movies as the price is great.,1387670400,,197,3.3777777777777778

1590977,3,B00005JPXS,"The story is only very loosely based on the fabulous books -- the characters and setting and very broad plot points only -- but not nearly as good as the books are. They had to make wholesale changes in order to fit all five books into an under-two-hour movie, and in many cases those changes weren't for the better. Great casting, good acting, good CGI. If you're a fan of the books, just be aware that the story is very different.",1384819200,,432,4.345679012345679

I can say this is for older kids (tweens) because of the violence (but you have to know that goblins and trolls are not the nicest of creatures) so I would recommend those under 8 not watch this. (and I think under 10 but that may be a bit harsh) Over all it was a good story and it held my interest.",1382400000,,467,3.9680851063829787

The theme of an unsuspecting family struggling with its own drama of a husband and dad who's absent moves into a big old house.  A bit isolated the house creaks and thumps and mysterious things begin to happen.  What's nice is it isn't slasher scary, but more like cranky brownie spooky.  Secret rooms, forbidden journal, and squabbling siblings -- all nicely captured.  Devotees of the books (series) may have issues with film treatment, but if the film is taken just as a story on its own, I think a nice weekend treat for, as they say, the whole family.",1379203200,,618,4.63302752293578

The ""Special Features"" are a wonderful added bonus, especially the Field Guide, among others.  It's very well done, and I highly recommend this edition of the film to all Spiderwick fans, young and old!",1378080000,,374,4.391304347826087

1591029,2,B00005JPXS,"After reading the entire 5 books with my kids, I was excited about watching a movie to get a better visual of how the story looks. Sadly, the movie deviates much too far away from the book story. The acting is downright terrible for many of the characters, and the plot suffers greatly. What's worse is that the library had the books for free, which provided a great story and hours of entertainment. The movie cost me $2.99, and was time I'll never get back. :-(",1377561600,2,463,4.395348837209302

If you are looking for a fun and somewhat unique story line that will bring out the adventurous spirit in your children then this is a great choice.  The sibling rivalries are only slight and in tough times they unite together to accomplish their goals, interesting characters albeit cliche to an extent they each have their own niche that gives the movie that little extra special touch.

I would recommend it to anyone with children or anyone who enjoys folkish adventure tales.",1372204800,,547,4.618556701030927

1591205,4,B00005JPXS,This was a cute movie wasn't as good as they made it out 2 be but still worth buying..Was about a boy and his family moving into an old home that belonged to family and finding out that their were creatures that excisted that they never saw b4 was an interestng mystery fantasy movie,1359244800,,283,4.2592592592592595

1591238,4,B00005JPXS,The Spiderwick Chronicles is a remarkable fantasy you will never forget. There's a surprise around every corner. I've watched it 3 times and every time I saw something new.,1357948800,,172,4.9655172413793105

1591241,5,B00005JPXS,"My son (9) and I thoroughly enjoyed reading these books together. They are short chapter books with periodic images. He did find some of the words challenging if not impossible to figure out, which is why we chose to read it together. On the fair side, my son has difficulty with reading so it really depends on the skill of your child.",1357430400,,336,4.435483870967742
1591242,4,B00005JPXS,"As an avid Fantasy fiction fan, this movie just hit all the right buttons.  There were moments that I fell right into the storyline, completely forgetting that these creatures do not exist in real life.  I look forward to sharing this with my son once he is old enough to appreciate movies!",1357171200,,290,4.5576923076923075
1591243,1,B00005JPXS,"This movie may have been fine for someone who was not a fan of the books. I rented this to watch with my son as a reward for getting through all five books. Long story short, the film only marginally approaches the original story from the book series. It was a major disappointment for me. I really shouldn't be surprised considering almost every other film adaptation of a beloved story ends up being a disappointment. This one was particularly egregious. I don't get it. You don't have to write an original story. You have an instant hit and all you need to do is put it to film. Just follow the story as written. If you want to create art, go write an original story. If you are putting some other author's work to film, tell the author's story.",1356998400,6,748,4.388489208633094
1591244,4,B00005JPXS,"Mean, I liked this movie overall but in some areas I felt like something was just missing. For example,at the end of the movie the little pig guy cracked a joke and the movie was over. I had a bunch of questions like what happened to the book and were did the ogars go. I didn't read the books but I hope they are better than the movie. I am a 8 year so I might have a different opinion a grown-up would have on this but I still feel like this is  really more for kids than grown-ups. Still, I enjoyed it.",1356652800,,505,3.9029126213592233
1591245,5,B00005JPXS,enjoyed it very much would recommend as a purchase and found to much cheaper than in the stores. worth the buy.,1356566400,,111,4.333333333333333
1591266,4,B00005JPXS,"Our 9-year old thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was somewhat entertaining for adults, as well, though it was fairly predictable.",1355961600,,130,5.5
1591267,2,B00005JPXS,"First of all the acting was annoying.  Apparently, the best American accent Freddie Highmore could muster, for a character from New York, was something that falls between neanderthal and surfer.  As far as the amazing skill of playing his own twin, even Lindsay Lohan managed that......so, frankly, it's no tremendous feat.  Everybody else in the film probably had under 20 lines each.

The plot is barely coherent.  I'm guessing you're supposed to ignore it and just enjoy the crude CGI, but there are so many holes and few things of consequence that it can't be taken seriously.  Fine, except half the CGI is apparently provided by a leaf blower just outside the view of the camera.  The preview also makes it look like this film will be filled with amazing whimsical creatures, but, no, it's got about five.  Oh, and OF COURSE, one of the kids is a competitive fencer.  A fencer?  There are probably a grand total of 14 female fencers in the entire United States and one of them belongs to this family.  I think I would have had an easier time accepting her having been abducted and raised by swashbuckling pirates.

As far as the story, it basically involves a book inside a house that a bad guy wants.  No, not basically, that IS the story.  The book leaves the house, then comes back to the house, then leaves the house again and comes back to the house minus a few pages only to leave the house again....or does it?  Then it leaves again and comes back again.

Oh, but this is for kids, so it's not supposed to be more than a mindless CGI fest?  Fine, except that this movie is way too scary and gory for children.  One kid stabs a guy in the chest, kids are being dragged into the woods and attacked by invisible creatures, one kid gets puncture wounds on his leg from the teeth of one of these things and proceeds to shriek in pain for the next three minutes.  Any kid old enough to watch this is going to be old enough to feel insulted that you wasted their time...time they could have been practicing their fencing skills out in the backyard.",1355356800,2,2053,4.470430107526882

1591269,5,B00005JPXS,"Poignant fantasy film set in victorian and the modern day.  Elves, sprites, Trool, goblins, hobgoblin, and brownies surpass the tiny world around us.",1354838400,,149,5.478260869565218
1591270,3,B00005JPXS,"I got this one years ago, don't remember much about it now but know that I liked the level of detail and quality of the FX (visual effects by Tippett Studio, they do the wolves in the Twilight movies). Nick Nolte, as I recall, had only a small amount of screen time, Sarah Bolger (Irish, not American - in ABC's ""Once Upon a Time'') was thrilled to get to drive a car in one scene, and Freddie Highmore (British, not American) looked good as twin brothers (I think the extras show how that effect was achieved).",1354838400,,511,4.333333333333333

What a classic, kid friendly tale. Even if you've never read the books ( or your kids have never read them) its still a really good story with some life lessons intertwined with fairies and goblins.
Loved it.",1354060800,,364,4.367647058823529

1591296,5,B00005JPXS,"Our family LOVED the books - my 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son couldn't get enough - the five book series was read and over with far too quickly.  The movie, to my surprise, was very in sync with my imagination in many ways, but took some liberties with the story that I'm sure were more for saving film time than enhancing the story.  Overall - it was a great movie - probably even better for those that haven't read the books yet.",1353715200,,440,4.104651162790698

1591298,5,B00005JPXS,"Bought the movie after reading the books. It does combine all the books, and leaves a few events out, but overall it gets the gist of the story across. Great rainy afternoon kids movie.",1351900800,,185,4.470588235294118
1591299,5,B00005JPXS,"While the books were MORE interesting, the movies did not disappoint. I just miss the elves which were pretty cool on the book as well as the whispering troll. But i liked how the makers added a layer that parallels the experience of meeting shape-shifting evil Mulgarath to finally knowing the true nature of their father which became very stark in the movie. It gives the story a deeper dimension and the character, a more meaningful struggle. It was like he was learning to be a man from the outside and the inside at the same time. I also liked the ending of the crazy aunt more in the movie. But that said, the books are exciting for kids of all ages.  So all in all It's just a different experience! But I would recommend reading the book and then watching the movie!",1349481600,,773,4.405594405594406
1591300,5,B00005JPXS,"My family watched this movie and really enjoyed it. My 5 year old was a little frightened by some of the goblins, but overall, it wasn't too scary and it had lots of action, which kept my 5 year old interested the entire time.",1349481600,,226,4.159090909090909

1591304,1,B00005JPXS,"We rented the movie after reading the series. We were so disappointed that it did not follow the series, left out characters, added characters that weren't even in the book, left out so much of the books. It may have been a better movie had it not been titled ""Spiderick Cronicles"" leading the viewer to believe it was a movie of the series. Would I watch the movie again? NO!",1346976000,,376,4.385714285714286

I assume it was because it came from Great Brit., when I get it back I will be returning it. I wish I had known that DVD's from other countrys may not play in the US.  Would it be possible to let us know before  we purchase them?",1345766400,,383,3.7974683544303796

1591348,4,B00005JPXS,"Having read and enjoyed the books so well we really wanted to see the movie.  We liked it except for one thing.  In comparison to reading the books, doing so in a leisurely way, the action of the movie seemed so rushed, like everything had to happen in two days and be done.  It just wasn't comparable to the enjoyment we got from the books.  The special effects were great and they seem to stay true to the quality of artwork of the books.  The acting was good too, especially the double Freddie Highmore.  It was fun to watch as a family but we probably won't watch it again.  We'll probably read the books again instead.",1341273600,,623,4.318965517241379
1591349,5,B00005JPXS,I had a hard time finding this movie. I watched it on t.v. and just could not wait to see it again. Awesome movie if you like science fiction movies. I would recommend it to all.,1340236800,,178,3.9722222222222223

1591353,3,B00005JPXS,"Its tried & predicable at best. The cast is bland & forgettable. The action is ok but nothing really special. The story is not great but pretty good. There's also too much yelling,shouting & anger. More then The Spoony One yelling at a bad game. The most memoralbe part about this film in my mind is when  The Thimbletack changes into a boggart whenever it get angry ala Bruce Banner/Hulk. Overall,its not great but still a fun movie to watch. I give this film a 5 out of 10.",1326931200,,475,4.337078651685394

The child I intended to give it to is 7 years old and he was looking forward to seeing the movie.  I like to review movies before giving to my grandchildren.  This is definitely not suitable for a young child!!!  The story itself is interesting but the movie is too graphic and would lead to some children experiencing nightmares.  I think items that you sell should be denoted as suitable or non-suitable for young children.  Of course if you follow the Hollywood criteria for suitability I would reject many PG-13 rated items, since some are too graphic for even a 13 year old!  Be brave!  Design a decent rating system for parents and grandparents to review!",1311379200,7,759,4.611940298507463

It definitely holds your attention from beginning to end. My older daughter has always been fascinated with fairies, and while this movie didn't have fairies in it, it did have a secret world of magical creatures. My kids loved it because of the mythical creatures and it left them wondering if they could possibly be real, just not visible to the human eye. It is a movie that keeps your interest and doesn't have any bad language or other things that you really don't want your kids watching. I think both girls and boys would enjoy it, and if your kids are into reading, there is a whole series of books on the Spiderwick Chronicles. My girls love Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide. We rented it from our library and the kids loved it so much they asked for it so we could have our own copy.",1304035200,2,951,4.259668508287293

Using Freddie Highmore as both the twins worked but there is no need for scenes where Highmore seems to be looking into blank space when he is supposed to be looking at his twin. The scenes could have been shot without that necessity and been just fine.",1298592000,,468,4.2
1591381,4,B00005JPXS,"'The Spiderwick Chronicles' is a pretty decent family fantasy adventure film that was actually a lot better than I expected it to be. It follows a family who move to the country and find a book that shows how to find various supernatural and fantasy creatures. They have to stop the book falling into the wrong hands and here the adventure begins. The child actors are quite good and there's none of that precocious cutsey-ness that can drive you mad in other films. The effects are great and the storyline is pretty good as well. This film is quite short at just under 90 minutes and I didn't check my watch once as I became completely captivated by the story. If you like fantasy films then this should be right up your street and makes for a great afternoons viewing when you want a bit of fun and adventure. A solid four star film and well worth a try.

1591382,4,B00005JPXS,"I have never read the books so I wasn't sure what this whole thing was about.
I'll make it short.

The good.
Incredible sets,locations etc...
The plot advanced at a nice pace.
The music was done well.
It's a good watch but not nearly in the ""Potter"" category of excellence.

The bad.
My only real gripe is the acting.
And it wasn't just one actor, all of them gave great ""made for tv"" performances.
But for a major movie like this, the acting was below standard.
Is it enough to break the film?
Hardly but it is a persistant annoyance throughout the movie.

Otherwise...
Fun and not too serious.
A great movie for the family.
A tad too ""Disney saccharine"" for my tastes but still worth a rental.

1591383,5,B00005JPXS,We have the books and now the dvd. My son loves the adventure and I'm glad that I bought this. Just what I expected.,1293408000,,116,3.875
1591384,4,B00005JPXS,"The Spiderwick Chronicles released in Feb/08 is based on the first five books about Spiderwick written by Holly Black and Tony DiTierlizzi. There have been two series of books with the first five,four companion pieces and three more in a newer series. They are all enchanting pieces and this film adaption does the first series a certain amount of justice,considering it condensed the t five novels into one. The acting is very good and the pace never lets up throughout.
The story involves the Grace family who move into an old New England house once owned by their Aunt Lucinda(Joan Plowright);who now resides in a local sanitarium. Jared and his twin brother Simon(played both wonderfully by Freddie Highmore) are total opposites;Jared the forceful one while his brother Simon is the timid and meek one. Jared doesn't want to be there while Simon and sister Mallory(Sarah Bolger)are trying to make the best of things. When strange things start to happen(possessions are taken and/or broken) the blame goes squarely on Jared who they think is acting out;but no one believes he is innocent.
When Jared hears a knock in the wall but no one is around he finally gets his proof. He follows the noise upward through a dumbwaiter to the attic. In the attic he finds a book called the Field Guide to the Fantastical World around You,by the former owner Arthur Spiderwick,who went missing years before. The noise turns out to have been a small creature called a Brownie. If he is provoked he turns into a Bogart who can only be assuaged by honey,which returns him to a Brownie. Of course he becomes upset several times throughout the movie but his main duty,as set down by Arthur Spiderwick(David Strathairn),is to protect the book.
As things progress his brother and sister come to believe and see what Jared sees. There is a ring of salt around all around the windows and a ring of stones around the house. This is to keep the evil creatures that vie to take possession of the book,away from the house. The Brownie gives Jared a round stone with glass in it with which to see the unseen and when he looks out to the outer perimeter of the house,beyond the stones,he sees a myriad of different creatures all trying to get passed the barrier. When his brother Simon gets captured by the creatures he sets out to rescue him. He meets up with a hobgoblin called Hogsqueal who spits in his face and gives him the ""sight"";the ability to see the fantastical world around him without the round stone. Hogsqueal loves to eat birds,which will come in handy later on. He also sees Mulgrath a shape shifting ogre who is bound and determined to take over the world. When Mulgrath realizes he has the wrong brother he sends him back to get the book. He is followed and Jared and Simon run back,barely making it beyond the stone barrier.
The brothers and Molly try and formulate a plan. They will try and seek out old Aunt Lucinda in the nearby home to get her advice. Without the knowledge of the Brownie or anyone,Jared smuggles part of the field guide out to the sanitarium with him. There they find their old Aunt living alone with many faeries who supply her with food and company. Jared tells her what has happened and to her shock he shows her the part of the book. She tells him the book was written by her father who disappeared many years before when she was very young(6 1/2)and who never returned. They must seek out Arthur Spiderwick who is not dead but being held by the faerie-like Sylphs. He is the only one who can help them to destroy the book.
Before they leave however one of Mulgrath's goblins reaches through and grabs the partial pages and takes it to Mulgrath. In the meantime the children learn how to reach Arthur and summon a Griffin who takes them on a journey to see him in person. Arthur is being held in a trance like state and doesn't at first realize that what he sees is real. When he does Jared explains the situation and shows him the partial book. But the Brownie switched the book for a cookbook so the real partial book one is still back home. Arthur cannot help the youngsters but distracts the Sylphs with the book allowing the children to escape.
Back home the Grace family is preparing for an all out assault by Mulgrath and his army of goblins,as the partial book has given him enough information to destroy the protective circle and enter the house. The assault comes as predicted and the creatures try everything they have but after a fever pitched battle they are finally defeated with a healthy dose of tomato sauce,which
destroys all but Mulgrath. At the end of the battle Mulgrath changes into a bird in order to swoop down on Jared and the book but as he does Hogsqueal is in the branches of a nearby tree and his large tongue dispatches him forthwith.
The Graces go to the home and bring Aunt Lucinda home. As they are standing on the porch they turn and see Arthur Spiderwick floating down on a circle of Sylphs. They have allowed him to come home briefly because the book is safe within the house,but he cannot stay. Lucinda asks if she can return with him. He takes her hand and they both leave,joined together after such a long separation. The Graces go back to their life,with new found knowledge but happy for their Aunt and her new life with her father.
This movie's special effects are dazzling,especially Freddie Highmore's turns as two brother,but they never,ever intrude on the story but constantly compliment it. The acting is wonderful throughout and the story moves along at an excellent pace,never bogging down on too many superfluous details. Nick Nolte does a good turn as the evil ogre Mulgrath and Andrew McCarthy makes a brief appearance as Jared's father.
Technically the film has been transferred well and is in its' original widescreen a/r. Extras include the trailer,three featurettes including Its a Spiderwick World,It's all true and a Field Guide.
This a movie the entire family can enjoy and I highly recommend the film to everyone of all ages. It is a film that deserves a wider audience than it has gotten.

1591401,4,B00005JPXS,"Before writers Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi worked on the book ""The Field Guide"" (2003) and way before they created their eight books based on ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"", both writers have said that the story is based on an actual events that were told to them by a family in Maine.

After receiving letters from three young children about their experiences of discovering these magical creatures, it became an inspiration to write about their experiences and create a magical story based on their experiences via ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"".

With the popularity of the children's books, the first five books (""The Field Guide, ""The Seeing Stone"", ""Lucinda's Secret"", ""The Ironwood Tree"" and ""The Wrath of Mulgarath"") were then adapted into a film released in theaters in 2008 and has grossed over $162 million worldwide and for the most part, receiving favorable reviews from reviewers.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a film presented in 1080p High Definition and with many of the scenes featured during the day and night, one thing that is constantly emphasized throughout the film are its blacks.  Blacks are well done and outdoor scenes are quite vibrant and colorful.  We see the scenes of Fall with the leaves on the ground but for the most part, the film utilizes a lot of CG.  And overall, the CG is where most of the detail can be seen.  But in some ways, the film has its share of darkness and for the most part, I think it was the cinematographer's goal to capture the home being surrounded by darkness and light during indoor scenes are kept minimal.  But overall, I felt that ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" dark nature was fitting for the film and definitely looked much better than its DVD counterpart.

As for the audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD and in French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  I felt the film was quite immersive as dialogue and music was quite clear during the front and center channels.  But the roars of the monsters and the overall sounds being carried through the surround channels as it pans from left to right or right to left was pretty awesome.  Great use of the subwoofer producing really nice LFE during the monstrous sounds as a troll going after Jared and Mallory or the action sequences towards the end of the film.  There are plenty of action sequences in ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" and for the most part, audio quality is top notch!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that I had no knowledge of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" previously to watching the films and having watched the film, I truly enjoyed the magical aspects of the film and how the film was actually quite dark considering it was based on a children's book.  I actually tried to watch this film with my six-year-old son who insisted that since it was Nickelodeon movie, he wanted to watch it.  And 15-minutes into the film, he was literally scared and couldn't watch anymore.

But for me, I had a fun time and partly it's because of the Blu-ray's immersive soundtrack.  This film did a great job making you hear the monsters all around you and creating that dark atmosphere throughout the film.  ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" definitely does a great job in utilizing sound and those with a good home theater setup will enjoy this film's lossless soundtrack.

And for the film, it was great to see so many talent involved.  Seeing Mary-Louise Parker, Nick Nolte, Andrew McCarthy, Joan Plowright, David Strathairn in the film and also knowing that Seth Rogen and Martin Short providing the voices was pretty cool.  But you also have to give credit to English actor Freddie Highmore and Irish actress Sarah Bolger who did a great job in playing American kids.  Highmore especially did a fantastic job in having us believe that perhaps Jared and Simon were actually twins.  He managed to pull of two different characters, despite the two being twin brothers.

If I had any negatives with the film, it's when the film tried to use Jared's anger towards his parent's split and you suddenly go back and forth from the action to his family woes.  In just seemed a bit unusual to see things disrupted in that manner but fortunately, it happens only once or twice in the film.  And since the film is based on five books, one can only imagine how much storyline was left out from the actual film and how different or how faithful the film's adaptation was to the original books.

But overall, being a guy who has no knowledge of the books, it was pretty fun to have a film that was adventurous and dark.  Sure, there are a lot of these adventure/magical type of films that are being adapted into a film these days but I definitely found ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" to be quite entertaining and fun.  And you do get quite a number of special features included in the Blu-ray as well.

If you are looking for an adventure film to add to your Blu-ray collection and you enjoyed films such as ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" or even the Harry Potter films, definitely give ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" a chance.",1256601600,6,6957,4.757095158597663
1591402,5,B00005JPXS,"Hadn't had the pleasure of reading the books but after seeing this movie I definitely want to now.  Anyway, the movie is fast paced and scary to boot!!!

Highly recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 10 because it may be a bit too scary for anyone younger plus an older child would grasp the other lesson in the film which is the importance of family....",1255219200,,362,4.3088235294117645

1591404,3,B00005JPXS,"I enjoyed the original Spiderwick Chronicles books quite a bit -- although I find the whole ""chapter book"" format to be a little problematic -- and was looking forward to the movie version.

The film has nice production values and Freddie Highmore does a good job of carrying much of the movie, ably abetted by a solid supporting cast.

But while some changes made to the books were necessary -- the digression with the dwarves would have only served to slow the whole thing down, and elves don't seem nearly as magical as the sylphs in the film -- shifting the focus from all three Grace children to one was a mistake, in my mind, especially since the producers clearly were hoping for a Harry Potter-style film franchise.

Instead of each child getting their moment to shine and contribute to saving the family (and the community), Jared's tale as an angry child in the wake of a confusing divorce takes center stage instead. While this isn't bad, it turns the other children into sidekicks, whose lines mostly consist of ""what should we do, Jared?"" It's particularly frustrating that the book authors gave children an active, athletic female character -- instead of the bookish Hermione Granger types who are more common -- and the producers took her away, for the most part.

Still, it's an enjoyable film, particularly for elementary school aged children. Viewers who enjoy the film should pick up the books, where they'll get to see all three Grace children as heroes, rather than as sidekicks.",1244592000,,1500,4.824902723735408
1591450,3,B00005JPXS,"In ""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" based on the books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, a mother and her three children move into a cobweb-infested ancestral home, only to find the property already occupied by an assortment of goblins, ogres, griffins, fairies and sprites that the children's great-great uncle, Arthur Spiderwick, discovered living there a century earlier.

While the very youngest in the audience may be freaked out by the movie's intense action sequences and occasionally rather gruesome imagery, their older siblings will likely be drawn in by the darker tone and the self-aggrandizing nature of the kids-to-the-rescue scenario.  Most adults, however, will probably find less than meets the eye in what is, essentially, a domesticated version of the ""Narnia"" movies.  Still, what DOES meet the eye is often quite impressive, and the reassuring presence of such acting stalwarts as Nick Nolte, Joan Plowright and David Strathaim in minor roles goes a long way towards mitigating the rather mundane nature of the material.",1244332800,,1039,5.401234567901234
1591451,5,B00005JPXS,"Think of it as ""Home Alone - with goblins, sprites and bogles, oh my!"" And a griffin and a uncouth pig-like creature whose spit-in-the-eye (yeeech!) makes all the unseen world around a spooky old Addams-family house out in the middle of the north woods visible for twins Jared and Simon and their sister Mallory. As far as young Jared is concerned, he has been dragged kicking and screaming away from the city and his father by his newly divorced mother. Angry, resentful and with a hasty temper, he is still the one who finds the dumb-waiter hidden behind a plastered wall, the secret study upstairs and sealed book - possession of which drives the whole rest of the story. For the book was the creation of naturalist Arthur Spiderwick, and there in loving and minute detail is everything about all the creatures, great and small, helpful and malign who inhabit that secret and unseen world. Based on the popular book series by Tony DiTerllizi and Holly Black, the movie is exactly what young book-fans would have been waiting for.

The look and atmosphere of this movie is lush and believable; the various creatures are fully-realized, and some of the sequences - especially those involving the sprites -  are just dazzlingly beautiful. It is purely amazing how far this sort of thing has come. The Spiderwick Chronicles critters make Ray Harryhousen's stop-action creations in Jason and the Argonauts look as basic as a simple pencil sketch animated by flipping pages.

The extras are lavish, most of them included on a second disc.  The cast interviews come as a little surprise - here we have an American fairy tale, and the two child stars are from the British Isles, and the location shoots were in Canada. The most interesting, technically speaking is how the special effects critters were designed and generated - at a cost of much computer and tech-hours, of course. In the very near future, movie makers may well be able to get along without live actors all together, at the light-speed rate that effects generation animation is barreling along.",1243900800,,2056,4.865714285714286

It moves terribly quickly, with the feel of segues missing and of characters unconvincingly persuaded to believe unbelievable things.  The film felt like too much was being crammed into a short period of time.  While Highmore was wonderful as Jared, I found Parker to be not so different from other mother roles she's had, meaning she did well in it but was not exploring new territory. The visual effects of the film are intriguing, the overall plot entertaining.  As it was meant for children the film will likely greatly appeal to children.",1242950400,,673,4.767241379310345

1591455,5,B00005JPXS,"It is so difficult today to find a movie that will entertain the entire family -- children and adults alike -- without either innuendo that plays over the kids' understandings or a plot that plays below the adults. The Spiderwick Chronicles is a movie that will satisfy the entire family.

My wife and I enjoyed the movie at least as much as my 5 year old son and 2-1/2 year old daughter (she was probably too young to really enjoy it, but she watched anyway). The movie follows a family who has moved into an inherited home that protects the secrets of the world all around us. When the troublesome Jared stumbles upon his great-great uncle's field guide and ignores the warning not to read the book, he finds himself and his family surrounded by goblins and other fantastical creatures that no one else can see.

We join Jared and his brother and sister as they try to convince their mother of the dangers around them, only to be confronted face to face by an evil ogre trying to get his hands on the field guide. If the ogre succeeds, everyone will die.

Spiderwick is full of incredible special effects, the actors deliver a believable performance, and the story created just enough suspense to keep the entire family on the edges of our seats.

Looking for a movie the entire family can enjoy without the worry of innuendo, inappropriate language, or outright adult content? Spiderwick promises to deliver!

I love fantasies so enjoyed the movie very much. Our imagination can be a lot of fun. I will however give my view of the theme of the movie which is knowledge can be a dangerous thing. This theme is used a lot in today's world for various reasons. Examples can be found almost anywhere. Many governments use the excuse national security to keep citizens in the dark when they are at war to keep the enemy from finding out their spies or their battle strategy. In this instance however, a scientist is studying nature (representing lets say Darwin). Cute little fairies disguised as flowers represent a popular religion (lets say christiananity). And, the Ogre represents non-believers (lets say atheists). The message becomes clear at this point. If you stray from your religion (represented by the circle), the devil will get you and knowledge about nature (heresy)is used by the devil to destroy you.",1240704000,,1104,4.725388601036269

Engaging to both children and adult alike, this movie does not disappoint.

When I happened to catch a commercial advertising this movie while at a friend's house. I was intrigued by the special effects and imagery.

Intrigued enough that the commercial remained at the back of my thoughts enough that I broke down and purchased the movie not long after it's release.  The following Saturday afternoon, I curled up on the couch, popcorn on hand, slipped the dvd in the player and settled back.  Alternatively, I laughed, shivered a bit, and jumped during moments of the movie.  All in all it was a pleasant way to spend the afternoon.

I rated it as follows:

Imagery - 4 stars
Special effects were wonderful, the monsters cutely terrifying with alot of scene ambience.
Acting - 3 stars
Sometimes it felt forced, and at times the emotion was divergent from the storyline.
Story - 4 stars
This is something I would read my children, and grandchildren.
Entertainment Value - 4 stars
As I stated a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.

Over all I felt the movie rated 4 stars based on the imagery, story line, and entertainment value.

1591506,4,B00005JPXS,"We (my wife my 14 year old and I) watched the Spiderwick Chronicles, and we all really liked it. For myself I enjoyed the folk lore about the creatures of ""Faerie"" I have learned about in various stories over the years.

It is a fun story about learning to deal with disappointment, divorce and adversarial conflict. It is an interesting tale about keeping promises, and about accepting what you cannot change. Add to that pretty good CG effects and well thought out magical creatures, in a fast moving very watch-able story.

So here's the deal...
Often when trying to make a movie acceptable for kids to watch, the story gets so silly that it is a chore for adults to sit through, and conversely, in attempt to make a kids movie watch-able for adults, it often gets lost in sub-plots so that nothing works. This is not the case with the ""Spiderwick Chronicles"" it is a thoroughly enjoyable fast paced film that doesn't ever fall flat.

1591507,4,B00005JPXS,"This is another of those fantasy films that serves its purpose in that it entertains the viewer, no matter what the age. It's not among the elite in its genre, but it is a story that hooks you in by the 20-minute mark and you just go along for the ride, mainly to see how things will turn out.

There is good suspense in here, enough to make adults care about what happens, not just kids. There also are some scary scenes that are probably too much for small kids, but fine for teens on up. In all, you get a good mix of horror, comedy, fantasy and drama all rolled into one odd (fantasy) story.

To me, the star of the film isn't Freddie Highmore or the otheer actors, or even the story.....it's the special-effects, which are very good and a lot of fun to watch, from little beings to monsters to fairies to whatever.

Too bad it was released so early in the year; it will certainly be ignored at awards time. There were also some lukewarm reviews, which I don't understand.
The acting is, without exception, excellent. Freddie Highmore was perfection, as was Mary-Louise Parker, David Strathairn, Sarah Bolger & the wonderful Joan Plowright.

1591566,4,B00005JPXS,"Inventive, moves well, but is a bit too fanciful for my taste yet should appeal to the young.  A good movie for the kids during Halloween.  For me it was yet nother fantasy world vs reality flick that required me to invest my emotions in someone elses 'what if' world, (where magic and fantastical creatures are the norm), if I am to gleen any shred of enjoyment from veiwing the movie.

As I said , great for the kids especially at Halloween considering the movie is full of cute, (mostly), goblin like creatures. There is redemption at the end however that gives some closure, a quality sadly lacking in the Lemony Snickets movie.  This is really a good thing since the movie isn't good enough to engender a part 2, (but then, niether is Lemony Snickets).",1223164800,,757,4.544117647058823
1591567,3,B00005JPXS,"Another fantasy movie starring white kids; seems that Hollywood is running out of ideas.  Luckily this movie makes up with great execution and original special effects.  I have never read the book that inspired this movie, but it must be good.

The storyline is simple enough, a divorced mother takes her twin sons and daughter to a house in the countryside that was owned by her aunt.  There, the children discover a world of creatures of various shades of friendliness.  Some of these creatures want to obtain a book from the country house, and this quest for the book, called The Spiderwick Chronicles, is the chief conflict of the movie.  Its resolution is quite original and probably the best part of the movie.

Here are some things to look out for.  First is the great acting by David Straithan, in his first fantasy role.  Second is Nick Nolte's casting as the chief antagonist.  His voice is perfectly suited to his character.  And last is the twins played by Freddie Highmore.  He pulls of both quite well and makes each a distinct character.  Overall, a nice use of 2 hours.",1222560000,,1085,4.677248677248677

They did a wonderful job explaining everything. The acting was good, the graphics, special effects etc were wonderful and the action and plot were top notch. Just a well done fun fantasy movie for the entire family. (assuming the entire family is at least seven or eight years of age)This movie might be a little scarry for kids under the age of eight but besides the ""scarry"" parts there are no bad parts for your children.

Great job...... I hope they do a second movie.",1222128000,,744,4.503703703703704

1591610,5,B00005JPXS,"I have to say that I was generally surprised by this film as, although I'm not much of a Freddie Highmore fan I've seen most of and liked most of his movies. Spiderwick Chronicles I expected to be bad but I was again surprised and shouted ""DAMN IT!"" as I liked another one of his films. I so want to hate Highmores films but again and again he constantly gives us something great. I think it's time I get over my hate filled feelings and just say, ""OK he's awesome, I admit it."" Even doing an American accent when he's definitively upper class British is great, and he even plays two roles which, damn him he still manages to pull off brilliantly.

Twin brothers Jared and Simon Grace (Highmore) along with their sister Mallory discover a book, an encyclopedia if you will of goblins, fairies and other mythical creatures. They go unseen by the naked human eye but exist in a magical hidden world. The goblins are after this book as it contains mystical powers, which will help their leader Mulgarath become even more powerful. Their house is surrounded by an invisible field which keeps the goblins out, but now they are aware the book is in the house, Mulgarath and the goblins set out on a mission to get the book at all costs. In order to stop it, Jared, Shane and Mallory must find Arthur Spiderwick and have him destroy the book. The only problem is, Arthur wrote the book over 80 years ago and hasn't been seen since.

This is a genuinely magical film that will put off some casual movie goers expecting more. The use of special effects is authentic and unflinching with the interaction between the invisible creatures and the human characters seems shockingly real. The real genuine shock of it all is the interaction between the two Highmores. This was a genuinely unexpected item in the film and is no doubt something that will have pushed Highmores acting ability further. The evil Mulgarath goes relatively unseen until the final scene in the film, but is something that won't disappoint if you're expecting a truly scary looking creature.

One criticism I think I do have to point out is the clich of the start of the film. It's very much like every fantasy film we've all seen, the main character discovers something magical and dangerous and tries to convince those around him what he's discovered. Guess what, they don't believe him until they themselves are attacked by the hideous creatures. It does counter this clich when it becomes the film about closeness of family and banding together to fight the greater evil.

Great movie though, and is something that can be enjoyed by many film fans including the kids.",1221955200,,2631,4.663793103448276

I was still disappointed in this movie. I get why the studios think they can put fantastical creatures and plotlines in these films and think that all the Harry Potter starved children and adults would flock to see them, its all about money, and less about substance.

Knowing these boys were not twins made it even more excruciating to watch, because Freddie Highmore is a good actor, but here? Not so much. The mom was miscast, as well as Arthur Spiderwick; both actors have the emotional range of a piece of toast.

The creatures were disappointing, along the lines of ""nothing new"" with the exception of how cute Thimbletack was. A griffin, an Ogre, Fairies, Goblins, with all the promise of the books the movie was terribly frugal with bringing other creatures to the big screen. It would have been nice to see more.

I have to admit, the scariest thing in it wasn't the Ogre, it was when the house was being attacked, I just kept thinking ""oh that's gonna cost them"" and I knew then that it didn't bring out the kid in me, quite the opposite!",1220832000,7,1222,4.545454545454546

The film could've been a bit longer if for no other reason than to provide explanation for some of the odd happenings. And at first, due to the sibling attitudes, I almost turned it off. I'm glad I didn't though as once things started to go ""bump"" I was hooked. Good story line, nice acting, graphics, and a solid ending.

1591618,4,B00005JPXS,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is based on a series of popular children's fantasy novels written by Holly Black and Tony Di Terlizzi.  The first book premiered in 2003 with four more following in the next two years.  The film essentially encompasses the major plot of the five novels although a number of sub-plots and characters are left out and several significant changes were made to streamline the production, such moving the climactic battle from Mulgarath's castle to the Spiderwick estate.

The story centers on the Grace family, twins Jared and Simon, older sister Mallory, and mom Helen, who move into the country estate they inherited from their Aunt Lucinda(Joan Plowright) who is now living in a psychiatric facility.  Freddie Highmore plays the roles of Jared and Simon Grace in a remarkable performance.  I was convinced that they really were twins as Highmore gives each character a distinct personality and mannerisms.  Jared is the agitator and angry with his parents for splitting up and forcing the move to the country.  Simon is a thoughtful pacifist and animal lover.  Highmore's performance as the twins, as well as the technical aspect of having them onscreen together is flawless.

Jared discovers an old key that opens a truck in the study of Arthur Spiderwick, Lucinda's father.  Inside he finds a book, Spiderwick's Field Guide and a note warning not to open the book.  Well of course Jared opens the book, unleashing evil forces.  Jared meets a Brownie named Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) who scolds him for opening the book.  He warns him that Mulgarath (Nick Nolte), a shape-shifting ogre, wants the book to unlock its magical secrets and gain dominion over the world.  He has a legion of goblins, trolls, and other beasties to aid him.  A magical circle protects the house, but Mulgarath has found a way to dispel the enchantment, putting the family in peril.  The grace family has to find a way to defeat Mulgarath before he can get his hands on the book.

The Spiderwick Chronicles is an enjoyable film for the whole family and vastly superior to other recent films based on children's/teen fantasy novels, The Golden Compass and Seeker: The Dark is Rising. The Spiderwick Chronicles is geared to kids but could be too intense for young children as some of the monsters, Mulgarath most notably, are quite terrifying.  Martin Short is amusing as Thimbletack, the jittery-tempered brownie who can only be calmed by guzzling fresh honey.  Seth Rogen provides the voice for Hogsqueal, a Hobgoblin who aids the children.

There is a lot of CGI in Spiderwick that threatens to overwhelm the story when there are dozens of goblins scurrying about and the massive Mulgarath smashing down walls.  Still, it has its subtle moments as well with the gentle Sylphs who kidnap Arthur Spiderwick to keep him safe.  The tiny fairies look like dandelion fluffs blowing in the wind.  The simplicity of the plot also makes it very watchable for kids and probably the reason why so many of the book's subplots were dropped.",1219363200,,3039,4.95069033530572

1591662,5,B00005JPXS,"The '08 film `The Spiderwick Chronicles' is an exciting, exhilarating, enchanting and at times surprisingly eerie tale that absolutely bowled me over! There's nothing I enjoy more than a tale dealing with the denizens of the ""Secret Commonweath"" consisting of the elves, fairies, sylphs, goblins, trolls and the rest of the mythic creatures that move unseen behind every flower and stone, or on occasion a dusty book in the library for that matter.

There's not much in this movie that one could honestly point to as a totally original idea. Upon viewing `The Spiderwick Chronicles' one will immediately recognize the numerous bits and pieces of storyline borrowed from a rather broad spectrum of other well-known fantasy and horror films.

On the lighter side of the tale we see glimpses from such beloved family films as; `The Neverending Story' from '84, `Labyrinth from '86 and of course the immensely successful `Harry Potter' series.

However the plot of `The Spiderwick Chronicles' deals predominantly with the darker aspects of the Fairy Realm and this unexpected dark side of the film is what ultimately fascinates and beguiles its audience. The more children friendly films mentioned above are counterbalanced with cinematic aspects found in some surprisingly frightening adult films. You'll find overt correlations with such movies as; the legendary cult classic `Night of the Living Dead' from `68` and the '87 teen favorite `The Lost Boys'.

However the greatest source of inspiration for this storyline surely must have been an obscure little film from '03 titled `Inhabited'. In fact there are simply too many similarities for it to be a nothing more than a coincidence.

Having said all this let me also say that I don't share these similarities to dissuade you from viewing this film. I share it as an observation and nothing more. Afterall there's nothing new under the sun that hasn't been done before so the goal is to take what's already there and do it better and that's just what `The Spiderwick Chronicles' accomplishes. The film grabbed my rapt attention from the beginning and never let up. There's absolutely nothing I didn't enjoy about this film which is sure to become a classic in the years ahead.

Message to Parents: If you have small children who want to watch this please take the time to view it with them. The goblins and troll will appear quite frigntening to a young audience so be forewarned.

Postscript: Also remember to keep plenty of honey on hand and don't forget tomato sauce kills goblins.",1217548800,5,2536,5.023809523809524

1591664,4,B00005JPXS,"Visually appealing even if the story deviated significantly from the novels, THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES is bound to entertain young and old alike (but perhaps more the old).

Starting with the visuals, Tippet Studios and ILM worked exceptionally well together to put out some very vivid visual effects. The creature creations were both interesting and sometimes creepy and since this was a large part of what we see as the audience, I found that I was pretty well glued to my TV screen as I watched the DVD.

Although the kids in the film are much older than the kids in the books, I found this change acceptable and not irritating like some Spiderwick purists (and I think it's okay to be a purist as long as you look at the film as a whole and not in snippets).

The story is that of the Grace family and their inheritance of an old mansion belonging to a (supposedly) deceased family member, Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Night-and-Good-Luck/dp/B000E1NXJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Night, and Good Luck</a>). Strange things abound inside and outside this seemingly ancient place. But Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weeds/dp/B0018B7E8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weeds</a>) isn't interested so much in the place as she is getting away from her husband who's run off and left her with their three children. Mallory (Sarah Bolger) is the eldest and is the only daughter. Jared and Simon (Freddie Highmore,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00139W3NE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>) are twin boys but couldn't be more different. Simon is a self-proclaimed pacifist, while Jared is the belligerent and self absorbed one who finds the new home initially appalling and can't wait to be picked up by his father.

The house eventually reveals its secretive past: a place where Arthur Spiderwick discovered we humans are not alone in the world. Beautiful and sometimes terrible things lurk in our periphery -- and sometimes they are combined. This combination is quickly revealed when Jared finds a special reference book written by Mr. Spiderwick that explains each creature that hides in this peripheral land. With the book comes great danger. Knowledge of them is the primary problem, unless these special creatures want you to see them. And such is the case with Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) who initially is supposed to protect this book from prying eyes but fails to keep it out of Jared's hands. Thimbletack can also change from a caring creature to one of great disrespect and upset when things don't go the way he plans (note: keep honey nearby to reverse this process). But Thimbletack isn't the problem; it's Mulgarath (Nick Nolte,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peaceful-Warrior/dp/B000QEIOSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peaceful Warrior</a>), an ogre that desires the book and its secrets so that it can rule everyone and everything. And with him are his goblins and beasts that are tenacious in their pursuit of the book.

But can three kids convince their mother that this newfound world is real? And dangerous? Looking through rounded stones and getting ""spit in your eye"" helps to see them, but what of Mulgarath, the shape-shifting ogre that learns many secrets when pages from the Chronicles are ripped out and passed on to him?

The Grace's new house becomes the battleground, and the kids realize they need help and information. So they head out to see their great Aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Palfrey-at-the-Claremont/dp/B000GYI3PY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont</a>) who has been confined to a looney bin ever since she revealed to those around her that her father (Arthur Spiderwick) had been abducted by some of the creatures in this nearly invisible realm. Geared up with new and important ideas on how to fight Mulgarath and his legions, the Grace kids race back home and prepare for battle (which includes salt and tomatoes ...are we making pasta here?). But can the kids win against overwhelming odds? Of course they can ...with a little help from unknown quarters (gryphons, old men who aren't old, and Hogsqueal, a bizarre being with an infatuation for birds).

Most important to this story is that it is a modern one. It isn't ancient history or trying to be old-English style. There are cell phones and new cars and plenty of modern items that let the audience know when and where they are.

The acting is okay, but Joan Plowright shines as the superstar even though she's not given much screen time. I'm pretty fond of Freddie Highmore and his performances in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/August-Rush/dp/B00133KFGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">August Rush</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory/dp/B000BB1MI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>, but here he was just ""okay.""

The big winners in every sense, though, were the special effects and the scenery. It really pulled the viewer in and made you believe in the things you were seeing; no small task nowadays.

I would warn parents, though, that the PG rating is very well deserved. The violence is ever-present, as are the stabbings of small, evil creatures. It could also be a bit unnerving for kids to see a young boy being dragged off into the wilds by initially invisible creatures. Just a warning for those with real young ones.

You won't be disappointed in the movie for popcorn-munching-in-the-living-room entertainment.  But if you're a fan of the books, you know the movie has just skimmed the surface of possibilities.

Mallory, Jared and Simon never realize what life has in store for them when their mother moves them into the spooky old mansion of her great-aunt Lucinda.

Jared is a bit rebellious, and Simon is a bit of a nerd. Mallory is the typical older sister, when things happen around the house, she naturally blames her brother. Jared discovers a secret room, with a locked box containing the writings of Arthur Spiderwick. Arthur has been missing for 80 years.

The family and the home are surrounded by creatures that desperately need to get their hands on Arthur Spiderwick's field manual. Will the creatures get the book? Will the family be forced out of their home?

1591703,4,B00005JPXS,"While I write this review keep in mind I have never read the books, though I probably will sometime soon because of this movie.

Pros:

Characters: I liked the characters of this movie, all were interesting enough to also keep the movie interesting.  I especially liked the same kid playing simon and jared (Freddie Highmore) and how different he made those characters.  Great job Freddie!  Though they weren't the most unique characters, they were good enough for me.

Story:  Wow! This was a great story! I never expected it to be at all.  Fun, fast paced, incredibly creative and clever, susupensful, and somewhat funny.  It was also fairly complex, and thats what I love about stories.

Graphics were fantastic as well.

Cons:

Sometimes characters were annoying, like Jared constantly bringing the book everywhere with him when he knew that was a bad idea.  Another thing was there was a lot of yelling.  But right when it got annoying they stop doing it, so I'm fine with that.

1591707,1,B00005JPXS,"First let me say if you did NOT read the books and just want a good film with outstanding and magical special effects for you and your older children then this really is a great choice; go ahead and get this movie and be happy.

If you want to watch the movie and expect it to follow the books you will be greatly disappointed.  I am not sure that the Amazon reviewer, Tom Keogh, read the books.  This is not a ""good adaptation"" of the books.  The writers of this movie took the characters and then twisted and distorted them into a story vaguely reminiscent of the books.  One of the main rewards we use for our children is they can watch the movie if they have read the books.  We read the entire 7 Narnia books and have seen the first two movies which are very good (especially Prince Caspian movie).

Let me quickly list just a very few of the differences from the movie and the book off the top of my head (we read the book quite a while ago and just bought the DVD and watched it last night).  I am sure there are many more differences but you will get the idea:
1.  They don't really play up the love of animals Simon has.
2.  There are no Dwarfs/sleeping Mallory in a box scenes.
3.  There is no quarry scene.
4.  There are no school scenes or mentioning.
5.  Jared does not have to solve any mystery to find anything (i.e. like figuring out the riddle of the trunk and that it had a false bottom).
6.  They don't have to find the seeing stone Thimbletack just happens to have it and hand it to them/Jared.
7.  Mallory and Simon are more antagonistic to Jared and come into believing that there are strange things going on much later.
8.  Thimbletack is mostly a green somewhat scary Boggart and very little of the Brownie.  He shape shifts before your eyes multiple times and is as addicted to honey as any Meth addict is to their drug.
9.  The scene to go find the book is different (Jared goes alone and Simon and Mallory do not help him in the dumbwaiter).
10.  The whole story line was changed when they were off to find Simon after he was carried away by the Goblins.  Mallory does not go with him and there is no Troll in the water (instead the Troll-which looks more like a giant iguana/dinosaur on steroids- chases them later when they go to see their Aunt).
11.  They do not go to see their aunt with their Mom they do through this underground tunnel system chased by a psychotic dinosaur they are saying is a Troll.
12.  There is a lot of honey, salt and tomatoes in this movie not found in the book.
13.  Hogsqueals initial scene is totally changed; as is his motivation; in the movie he is on some sort of crusade to revenge his family.
14.  The Griffin character was changed to Arthur Spiderwicks pet they somehow summon out of thin air and not rescued from the Goblins when trying to free Simon after they discovered Hogsqueal.
15.  There are no elves and they do not have to figure out how to get to Arthur Spiderwick (the summoned Griffin just flies there to him.
16.  Mulgaraths character is totally changed.  He shape shifts into two equally frightening characters, Nick Nolte on his daily dose of drugs and scleral icterus and a demon character that resembles a scary devil.
17.  The ending is totally different and has no resemblance to the book.  The finale takes place in their house and will scare young children and to my taking would warrant a PG-13 rating.  If your kids are desensitized to violence and horror then they will do fine otherwise I would read the stories and let the imagination go.  Hope this helps!",1215216000,34,3549,4.3399089529590285

1591749,5,B00005JPXS,"I have not read any of the Spiderwick books, so I am only reviewing the movie.

While there is plenty of fantasy here for kids to enjoy, some aspects of the way the story is told might leave younger kids a big confused.  However, I don't think they will care.  What is here is quite delightful and there is something here for everyone to enjoy.  Well, unless you dislike fantasy stories.

The story opens with a mother, a teenage daughter, and twin teenage boys moving into a spooky old house that a relation owns.  The mother has moved her family to this new city to get a job and there is obviously some fresh pain in the family.  The house is not only old and spooky there is a lot of odd stuff like salt at the windowsills, can and cans of tomato sauce, and a seemingly endless supply of those little bear containers full of honey.

One of the twin boys if very aggressive and angry about being separated from his father and the other deals with his hurt passively.  At some point you will come to realize that there mother and the father have split up, but the angry boy has not been told this and refuses to understand the evidence all around him.

Damage is done to the house that everyone blames on the angry twin with some evidence, but the major damage comes from the house's brownie / boggart, Thimbletack.  Along the way the boy discovers a secret room, a key, and a sealed book with a note that warns him not to open or read the book.  Of course he ignores the warning.  All kinds of bad things ensue.

The chief obstacle is a very bad creature named Mulgarath.  He has many servants who help him in his evil and cruel pursuits.  However, his main goal in life is to get that book and use what is in it to dominate the world.  The book was put together by Arthur Spiderwick to document his studies of the beings of the unseen world all around us.

Once the bad guys become aware of where the book is they will stop at nothing to get it.  The battles are more intense than little children can take, but not horrible.  The suspense is quite good and the revealing of all the components of the unseen world is quite wonderful.

I think it is a good family film, if tinged with sadness throughout.

1591754,4,B00005JPXS,"A terrific tale for children, `The Spiderwick Chronicles' shows the plight of a NYC family moving into an old, decrepit house in the country while the children discover an ancient book that brings faeries, ogres, and sprites to life. Led by chief, Mulgarith (Nick Nolte), the ogres try to steal the chronicles from Simon, Jared, (both played by Freddie Highmore) and Mallory (Sarah Bolger) while Hogsqueal (Seth Rogen), a hideous changing forms leader, tries to destroy the children. Enchanting, transporting, and whimsical, 'The Spiderwick Chronicles' aims to please, even as it might be a bit too frightful for the wee little ones.

Merits:

1.) The movie's a whimsical throwback to the stellar Spielberg days of `E.T.' and `Gremlins' with Highmore more than a passing resemblance to Elliott (Henry Thomas).  Thumblejack (Martin Short) is a charming (if not high strung) original.

2.) Faeries, ogres, and sprites have their day once more in big screen splendor.

3.) The haunting gives the house a personality, reminiscent of the quality of `Monster House' and `Poltergeist'.  Suspension of belief is in high size (as are the special effects).

4.) Excellent portal for the imagination with a good plug for the magical powers of books.

5.) The screen presence of David Strathairn (as past portal figure Arthur Spiderwick) and believable performances all around.

Demerits:

1.)  Some of the film's elements are familiar.

2.) It could provide too many nightmares for parents with lingering images of tomato sauce splattered on the walls with holes poked through them.  Potential Amber alert false alarms are presented with missing children hunting down ancient ancestors and fighting goblins.",1214611200,5,1696,5.307116104868914

It is no one's first choice, but newly single mom Helen (Mary-Louise Parker) has a job in the area.  And it allows them a chance to move into the Spiderwick mansion.  Helen is related to the Spiderwicks.  In fact, she has inherited the mansion, so it cuts down on costs.

Of her three kids, daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and son Simon (Freddie Highmore) are okay with the change.  Simon's twin Jared (also Freddie Highmore) is not.  He can't wait for his dad to come and get him out of there.

The house is creepy, and right away things start to go missing.  Jared hears a noise in the wall that leads to the discovery of a dumb waiter and a hidden room.  Exploring further, Jared finds an old book with a warning on the cover.  Ignoring the warning, Jared opens the book and starts to read.

It's only after reading the book that Jared realizes what he's done.  See, the book contains the secrets of all the creatures that are in the world around us that we can't see, like fairies, goblins, and ogres.  And one ogre in particular, Mulgarath (voiced by Nick Nolte), wants that book so he can destroy everything.  Now Jared, Simon, and Mallory are in the fight of their lives to find a way to defeat Mulgarath and stay alive.  Can they do it?

This movie is an adrenaline fueled ride.  It is creepy and intriguing from the first few seconds and builds from there.  I was on the edge of my seat by the end.  While I absolutely loved it, it might frighten young kids.  I would seriously question whether anyone under 8 or so would enjoy it.  Of course, you know your own kids best, so judge accordingly.

While a fast paced thrill ride, the story still hangs together.  A couple things got glossed over in the ending, but they were minor.  The acting is great as well, especially from Sarah Bolger and Freddie Highmore who carry the film since they are in every scene.  Freddie makes both his characters different.  I expect we'll be seeing lots more from him in the future.

The special effects could have been a little better.  I don't know whether they were going for stylized or what, but they aren't up to the level we are used to seeing these days.  And it just goes to show how spoiled we are because they are certainly adequate.  They just aren't the blow your socks off stuff we normally see these days.

Nonsense.

I found this movie to be an entertaining story for people of all ages; very suitable family fare, as well as engaging for anyone who's a fan of the fantasy genre.

It's not an earth-shaking spectacle, not does it set out to be. The story's told on a level understandable to younger children through the magical spectacle of fairies and goblins, but with adult issues also interwoven to capture the interest of older viewers (though frankly, I found the magical spectacle stuff really enchanting).

Fast-paced, well performed, nicely shot, I can recommend this movie for anyone who's looking for a fun bit of escapism for an evening.",1214265600,5,772,4.7819548872180455
1591791,4,B00005JPXS,"I think we're all aware now of Hollywood's tendency to favor familiar grounds or new, exciting but undependable territory. Instead of giving the go-ahead to wild and out-there movies which might not bring in the money but offer unique stories, producers tend to love the next big thing, whether it's Japanese horror remakes, gross-out comedies and our current trend: the children's fantasy film. So far they've ranged from tremendous (Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter), serviceable (Bridge to Terabithia) to incredibly subpar (The Seeker). The Spiderwick Chronicles, a successful book series by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, is in the same league as Terabithia as it's pretty successful in areas but then ends up being only a good adaptation.

The Grace family are moving from New York to their relative's house in the countryside. Getting hit particularly hard is Jared who's acting outward and rebelliously towards his twin brother Simon, sister Mallory and his mother Helen. However, upon hearing strange sounds and investigating the attic, Jared comes across a book written by Arthur Spiderwick, a relative who went missing 80 years ago, which details many creatures and secrets. But a nasty ogre is hellbent on discovering the secrets within the book so Jared has to somehow protect the book with the help of his siblings who also discover a world they can't see.

Upon finishing watching the film, I had to admit I actually liked what I saw and found it entertaining despite it being on a book series I never read or being an unfortunate victim of a film I might forget in a few years. With a tone that's more akin to Willow or Gremlins than Terabithia had (despite the scenes after a character's fate is revealed). The film's a bit more heavier on action and the film couldn't really be described as ""safe"" for the kiddies. On one hand it is thrilling that sees a film a bit more confident in its storytelling and not just simply being a toothless film for everyone but the action scenes might be a little bit too intense for the kiddies.

The other thing that might bother people is that at times the film feels a bit too much for its fans and not for general audiences like me who haven't read a word from the series. While certain concepts are easy to grasp, other things like terms and rules and uses for things kind of fly over your head and you're like ""wait, so the thing does the thing....right?"" and not to mention the film itself feels a bit truncated and despite the excellent sense of pacing, the material feels like certain sections were chopped out for time. But the film works with what it has and (used since only certain books were adapted) the film's entertaining all the way through without being too long.

Another highlight is that there's an actual emotional story running throughout and leading the pack is Freddie Highmore playing the dual roles of Jared and Simon, one being outspoken and brash while being very shy and somewhat of a wimp. Managing to create two distinct characters rather than just being told to be a rebel on one day and introverted on another, he's the highlight of the film. But we also have Sarah Bolger as Mallory, David Strathairn as Arthur Spiderwick and Mary-Louise Parker from tv's ""Weeds"" who does pretty well considering her smaller role. And surprise, Martin Short isn't entirely annoying as a house elf and Seth Rogen is great as a bird-eating...pig/troll/goblin. The effect work works pretty well though closeups of the creatures look a bit too texture-y for me.

I'd give the film a solid rental since I doubt I'll end up dying to revisit this months for now but for the time the film was on, I have to admit I was entertained the whole way.",1214265600,,3708,4.742635658914729

1591797,4,B00005JPXS,"""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a fantasy film with a slightly dark side. Though the film's premise is pretty familiar, its tone sometimes becomes a little different from other recent fantasy films like ""Stardust"" or ""The Golden Compass."" Some creatures such as fairies and goblins may look too grotesque or creepy, even scary for some kids - though adults may find something humorous in their behaviors.

""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" based on a series of children's novels by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, begins with the Grace family - spirited Mallory (Sarah Bolger, ""In America""), twins Jared and Simon (both by Freddie Highmore, ""August Rush"") and their mother Helen (Mary-Louise Parker) - moving into old ""Spiderwick"" estate. Those kids are not very happy living in this dilapidated house surrounded by thick woods. And this spooky house may be haunted. At least that's how Jared (Freddie Highmore) thinks when he notices something is crawling behind the wall.

Jared, most adventurous (and most careless) one of the three children, discovers an old laboratory. There he finds an old book that has a note warning not to open it. Of course, he ignores it. He realizes his mistake too late when he knows the house is beleaguered by some invisible critters led by terrifying Mulgarath (cameo by Nick Nolte).

Though the film's story may sound like zombie film, it is, as some reviewers point out, actually closer to ""Home Alone"" where clever children outwit ""bad"" goblins. The battles are, as IMDb's parents guide says, ""suspenseful but not too violent,"" but still some of the creatures (including ""good"" ones) may look too creepy for some. Remember the animation supervisor / characters designer is Phil Tippett, whose great visual effects works include those of ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Willow.""

Entertaining and fun as it is, ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is not perfect. The double role by Freddie Highmore does not work as it should because Simon is much weaker as character than Jared. The sub-plot about kids' parents can be much shorter. Some part of the film's actions is a bit conventional and the ending is ... well, certainly unique, but you may dislike it.

Still director Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"" ""Just Like Heaven"") keeps a good pace throughout, never wasting time before starting actions, and these actions are always fun to watch.

1591849,3,B00005JPXS,"I just saw this over the weekend- and yet again, the industry belts out another fantastical tale complete with magic, and goblins, and monsters, and plenty of CGI, and here ya go kids-- thank you, good night.
I've always been partial to the fantasy genre, but it seems everywhere you turn, there's another Harry Potter-""esque"" movie coming out.  I.E., The Golden Compass, Stardust, Lemony Snicketts, Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium, and on and on.  And the beauty of it is ""with magic, anything is possible.""
Oh the story line is thin?  Magic.  Oh that last scene doesn't make sense?  Magic.  Oh you couldn't keep your kids quiet for two hours?  Magic.  Oh your tickets and popcorn came out to $42.00?  Well that's the REAL Magic isn't it?  This movie was cute, and easy on the eyes, but I don't think J.K. Rowlings is losing any sleep.",1206230400,4,833,4.682758620689655
1591850,4,B00005JPXS,"As I went to see this, I wondered; Why do they keep making fantasy movies with child protagonist(s)?

And then I saw the movie, and I realized it's because it works.

The movie was fun. Not too serious, just serious enough. Freddie Highmore starts off slow, but ends up impressing with some serious skills, playing both Jared and his pacifistic brother Simon. (Special note to his performance in the scene when Jared goes to rescue Simon from the goblins.)

I thought the end was a bit corny and predictable, but overall, I found the movie light and enjoyable: Everything you could expect from a film of it's kind.

On an end-note: After I saw the movie, I just had to try crackers and honey. It's actually quite good.",1205625600,2,718,4.5859375
1591851,4,B00005JPXS,"Three siblings (Freddie Highmore, as twin brothers, and Sarah Bolger) find themselves in conflict with creatures from a hidden world when they discover the creepy old field guide of Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) in the attic of their isolated new home.  Based on a popular series of children's fantasy books (by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black) , this is an entertaining film, even though it doesn't do a very good job of presenting a fully realized fantasy realm.  For example, I never understood why Spiderwick's book had such powerful potential for world domination, nor did I have a clear idea of the kinds of rules and restrictions govern the interactions between these fantasy creatures and the inhabitants of the ""real world.""

To the film's credit, however, the story was snappy and entertaining enough that I didn't think about these issues until after it was over.  Final verdict: a fun, thrilling adventure and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, though I'm not clamoring for one.",1205539200,,995,5.048780487804878
1591852,4,B00005JPXS,"I liked *The Spiderwick Chronicles*.  I'll admit that I didn't read the books because I was afraid that it would be similar to the *Lemony Snicket*, which I found it to be depressing and redundant.

Anyways, the Grace family inherit an old house from their Great-Aunt Lucinda, who has been put away in an assisted-living housing.  The Grace kids, Jarod, Simon, and Mallory, soon discover an unusual field guide.  The field guide, complied by Arthur Spiderwick, lists magical creatures that exist right outside of their new home.

However, a shape-shifting ogre, Mulgrath, has been waiting for years to get his hands on the field guide so he can dominate both the magical and human worlds.  Gradually losing to Mulgrath, the children seeks assistance from Great-Aunt Lucinda, who, in turn, sends them off an adventure of a journey in preparation of the final battle.

Overall, wonderful story, filled with wonderful characters.  Hogsqueak, a bat-like creature, is my favorite of them all.  I do wish there were additional background provided on each of the magical characters as well as their purpose.  Ah, I guess I'll have to read the books to find out.

I found this story/film to be enjoyable by both kids and adults.  That is, if the adults are young at heart.  Also, if you've got a sensitive side, you might shed a tear or two.",1204502400,,1333,4.845132743362832
1591853,5,B00005JPXS,"This movie was an incredible surprise and the acting was TOP-notch!  My favorite actor was Aunt Lucy.  I was at tears at the end. *No Spoilers!*  The effects were great, the story was well paced, and the action actually had me at the edge of my seat sometimes.  I gave it 5 stars because I honestly believe that this movie was BETTER than ANY of the Harry Potter films to date.",1204416000,3,377,4.267605633802817
1591854,5,B00005JPXS,"It's a scary, spooky, creepy old Charles Addams house where the secret book of formulas by Doctor Spiderwyck lies protected by a similar-to-but-smaller-than-a-hobbit animated creature who dotes on honey and saltines. He's a good guy called Thimbletack played by Martin Short. The Grace family: a single mom, her fencing daughter, and her twin boys Jared and Simon are about to move into this monstrosity of a house with salt spread around all the windowsills and a circle of mushrooms, protecting the house from ogres.
 The evil monster Mulgrath played in a cameo role by Nick Nolte wants that book. He uses his evil band of ogre-frogs to surround the house. They don't like salt or tomato sauce. One by one starting with Jared, the family members learn that they are living in a bad and dangerous place. They get scared out of their wits, but they are resourceful and get help from the famous British actress Joan Plowright.
 I've seen cleverer movies and monsters who were more monstrous and truly frightening. This one has special effects that are unexceptional, It has some wit. But the good thing about it is even young children will enjoy it. Adults and kids will enjoy the flying griffin sequence. At heart it's a tender story, especially the segment dealing with the too-eager-to-probe-the-unknown scientist and his daughter. Good entertainment for the whole family.",1203984000,2,1374,5.021929824561403
1591855,4,B00005JPXS,"I saw this movie with my young son.  It's a less complicated C.S. Lewis type of story of evil vs good.  I did not know the story line before going, but I found it quite captivating.  My only complaint was that the boy-actor did a poor job as the studious twin.  That character was a bore and he played it as if the twin were on meds.  There are many scenes that I think would frighten a very young child especially with creatures that are invisible, attacking children and are in the walls.  However, the story and cinematography has much to offer all other ages including adults.",1203897600,,580,4.373831775700935
1591856,3,B00005JPXS,"I went into seeing this movie with high expectations. I love the books, and I love their possibilities more, and one of those possibilities was a truly extraordinary movie. But that wasn't what I got.

The plot, what there is of it, hinges around three siblings, Jared, Simon, and Mallory Grace, and their rather quick-to-judge mother. When the Graces move into Spiderwick Manor following a divorce, Jared finds a book - a field guide - that he soon realizes should never have been uncovered.

This should have been a great movie. And yet, I could tell from the first few minutes that it wouldn't be. Aside from the many great scenes and moments from the books thrown away (Mallory's kidnap, the mother's kidnap, the various other creatures besides goblins, hobgoblins, and griffins) the acting is relatively stiff, except for the good performances of Freddie Highmore as twins Simon and Jared, and the ""batty"" Aunt Lucinda. The direction, too, could have been better; as it was it seemed hasty, thrown together, juvenile, and trying-to-be-modern (like Jared's oft-shown cell phone and iPod).

The ending was really quite dumb and had me rolling my eyes as all the young boys in the theater guffawed. I honestly can't remember if the villain was disposed of like that in the books, but if he was, it was done better than in this movie.

Overall, it wasn't a terrible movie, but it certainly wasn't a great one, and it didn't come near the quality of the books. The books simply had more atmosphere, creativity, and overall charm.

1591857,5,B00005JPXS,"Helen Grace (Parker) and her kids Mallory (Bolger) and twins Jared and Simon (both Highmore) are starting fresh after Helen's separation from the kids' father.  They are moving into the Spiderwick Estate, a mansion that Helen inherited from her Aunt Lucinda (Plowwright).  The estate has an interesting history though.  80 years ago, Arthur Spiderwick (Strathairn) wrote a ""field guide"" to the world around him.  This guide includes all kinds of fantastical creatyres.  By writing it, he unleashed some terrible forces and now an army of goblins is amassing.  Led by the ogre Mulgrath (Nolte), they seek to take the book away from the protection of the house.  The kids are all that stands between Mulgrath and world domination.

""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a surprisingly well done movie.  For a movie that covers five books, there isn't a feeling that much was lost in the translation.  There is a lot of action that keeps the moving quickly.  The child actors do a good job in the roles, especially Highmore in dual roles.  The story is not complex, but is not simple either.  Plus, it deals with serious issues like divorce, a topic that many kids will relate to.  ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is an excellent move for kids from about 6-7 on up to adults.  I highly recommend this film.",1203638400,50,1292,4.862385321100917
1591858,4,B00005JPXS,"Jared and Simon Grace (Freddie Highmore, ""Finding Neverland"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""), twin brothers and their older sister, Mallory (Sarah Bolger), move into the dilapidated Spiderwick mansion with their divorced mother Helen (Mary Louise Parker). The family home is available to them because Aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright), the 86 year-old daughter of Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn), has finally gone to the sanatorium to live out the remainder of her life. Almost immediately, Jared, the more rebellious, surly of the twins, suspects there are creatures living in the house. He soon finds Spiderwick's secret study and a handmade book covered with a wax seal and a warning. ""Do Not Open This Book"". Naturally, Jared opens the book and learns of Spiderwick's lifelong obsession with faeries, goblins and trolls. Throughout his life, Spiderwick documented everything about these creatures, charms, cures, protective spells. As soon as he finished the book, Mulgarath (voiced by Nick Nolte), a huge, monstrous troll, made it his quest to get the book because once he has the information in his possession, he has control over all beasts, including humans. Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short), a house elf, helps to protect the book and Hogsqueal (voice by Seth Rogen) helps the family in their battle against Mulgarath and his goblins. Naturally, as soon as Jared reads the book, he becomes a target and Simon and Mallory have to help him fight off the troll and his minions. Their mother, dealing with a move, a divorce and family problems, is slow to catch on, but once she does, she helps with the battle.

Based on a series of popular children's books ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a very well-made, exciting, fast-paced film for the whole family. It has the detail, the level of danger and the characters most filmmakers strive for when making a film they hope will join the cannon of family classics like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and the dozens of other family classics.

Directed by Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"", ""Freaky Friday""), the child actors are really good. Freddie Highmore, who was so memorable in ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", plays twin brothers Jared and Simon. Twins are difficult for adult actors to play, so it seems even more remarkable that Highmore is able to create and maintain distinct personalities for both. Jared is the more rebellious one; Simon is the quieter, more accepting child. When they first arrive at the Spiderwick house, it quickly becomes apparent Jared would rather be somewhere else. He has his iPod turned up so loud so he can refrain from interacting with his brother, his sister and most especially, his mother, who he considers responsible for his parent's divorce. In fact, he is waiting for their dad, Richard (Andrew McCarthy) to show up and take him away to live with him. Jared is also the more adventurous brother, so when he finds a mysterious book marked ""Do Not Open"", he will, of course, open it. Simon's the more reflective, quieter brother. He realizes there is a rift in the family and wants to try to help repair it. But he is also willing to follow his brother just about anywhere. So when it becomes apparent Jared's actions in opening the Spiderwick Chronicles have placed them all in danger, Simon immediately jumps into the fray and fights alongside his brother.

Sarah Bolger plays Mallory, the older sister, and she is also good. As with older siblings, she knows and realizes things the younger kids won't and can't, and tries to help her mom deal with the situation. She is, initially, unable to believe Jared and Simon's tales of creatures living in another world just outside the house, trying to break through. But when she gets a glimpse of them, she joins her brothers and brings her unique skills to the mix.

Mary-Louise Parker plays Helen, the divorced single mom trying to make a fresh start of it in the dilapidated family mansion. So often in `family films' the story is centered around the kids and the adults are barely a presence in their life, receiving little, if any, attention from the filmmakers. In ""Spiderwick"", Helen has a lot of issues of her own, things she is trying to deal with as she tries to raise these three kids on her own. She yells too much and doesn't listen, two key problems she has to deal with, which will also play a significant role in later events in the story. It is nice to see a fully fleshed out adult role in a `family film' like this.

David Strathairn plays Arthur Spiderwick, the man who spent his entire life chronicling everything her could about the faeries, goblins and trolls living around him. As soon as he finished the book, he sets into effect events that will affect and follow his family for eighty years. His role is brief, but no less memorable. His actions have flavored every frame of the film, and we always remember him and what he has done.

Joan Plowright, a formidable actress, plays Aunt Lucinda, a woman who has had to live with the consequences of her fathers' actions, alone, for the last eighty years. She plays a key role in the action late in the film, giving the family the extra knowledge they need to beat Mulgarath.

The voice actors (Nick Nolte, Martin Short and Seth Rogen) are all good. Surprisingly, Short is pleasantly low-key, giving his character, a house elf who helps Arthur Spiderwick protect his book, a believable fairy tale quality.

""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a beautiful film to watch and this can only be credited to Caleb Deschanel, the cinematographer who directed ""The Black Stallion"" and has worked as a cinematographer on dozens of other films. He captures the look and feel of what I have to guess is upstate New York, in the fall, in all its wonder and glory. The film mimics the palette of falling leaves, painting everything in orange, brown and dark yellow tones. It is really a beauty.

And this beauty meshes abnormally well with the CGI. Early on, the story establishes the boundaries of the human world and the magical world explored by Arthur Spiderwick. When he realizes he needs to protect his family, he creates a barrier around the house to protect them from attack. As soon as he finishes his book, he creates a need for Mulgarath to enter our world, so an alternate world is opened. Because these two worlds are so similar, little is done to make one seem different. The world inhabited by the magical creatures is a little more saturated with color, but that is about it. When these creatures pop up, they magically appear and seem to blend in to this world effortlessly. This is a key of how good the CGI is, and how well it blends with Deschanel's cinematography. It all appears seamless. There is a level of reality to them, making them appear more realistic.

Spiderwick also creates a special monocle lens allowing its wearer to see the other creatures. This allows for some interesting and exciting battles, especially in the beginning. Mallory, who is good at fencing, uses the lens to battle off the creatures, turning to fight them only when she able to see them. Later, there is a plot point negating the need for this lens, making the battles less interesting. Until Mom needs some help, to protect her and help her kids fight off the attackers.

Director Waters has done a great job of combining believable performances, beautiful cinematography and great special effects in a rousing adventure for the whole family. Better yet, the film creates a definite feeling of menace for the characters, giving them a real goal to fight for, giving the audience something to root for. And the outcome is moving as well as believable. If you are able to suspend your disbelief a little and go with the flow of the story.",1203552000,4,7781,4.820973782771536
