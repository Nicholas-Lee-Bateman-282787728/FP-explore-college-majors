2354809,5,B000A345DA,Cartoons today are nothing like what I watched growing up. Heathcliff is a cat that thinks he owns the street where he lives with family. Heathcliff gets into all kind of trouble. This was around in the 80's I loved heathcliff growing up. I am so glad that this series has stayed true to what it was like back then minus the commericals. It is really a shame how they are remaking all the classic cartoons to look and be so much different. I would love to find all the classic cartoon so that I could show my kids what I watched when I was a kid.,1329868800,,546,4.11214953271028

I actually bought this to share with my young nieces. They love it! They want to watch it over and over and keep laughing. This features the voice of the legendary Mel Blanc. Four discs, 24 episodes. Each episode has one Heathcliff short, and one of The Cadillac Cats.",1294272000,,443,4.620253164556962

2354813,5,B000A345DA,"Meeeeeow! Shout Factory has finally given fans of ""Heathcliff and the Catillac Cats"" something to MEOW! about. For the first time on DVD format fans will be treated to all 24 complete episodes of Heathcliff also containing all the Catillac Cats segments as they originally aired in the 80's. Voiced by the one and only Mel Blanc your family will be treated to hours of feline fun and frolic compliments of Heathcliff and The Catillac Cats.

To his feline friends Heathcliff is nothing more than a con-cat and neighborhood practical joker. For the rugged but loveable Bulldog Spike he's the constant thorn in his side and endless source of torment. The always scheming Riff Raff leader of ""The Catillac Cats"" is joined by sidekicks Hector, Wordsworth and Mungo. Riff Raff along with his girlfriend Cleo and the Catillac Cats live in a junkyard and drive a Cadillac car that can change into anything. Due to Riff Raff's cat brained ideas to get rich quick and eat gourmet grub, the Catillac Cats are constantly in and out of trouble.

This four disc set from Shout Factory is well done and a welcomed addition to any DVD collection. The disc packaging is well done and the disc artwork makes this set even more attractive to own. The picture is in its Aspect Ratio of: 1.33:1 has been remastered to DVD and other than some minor blemishes and speckling it's still very good. The sound in my opinion could have been much better; it's inconsistent throughout the episodes and distorted at times. Overall the quality is much better than I had hoped for and I'm giving ""Heathcliff and the Catillac Cats"" five stars and a bowl of milk.

2354814,3,B000A345DA,"I was somewhat please with the 4 disc collection of Healthcliff. I never was a die hard fan of the cartoon but enjoyed watching the show as a youngster. This is definitely something to keep the kids at bay or to rekindle the kid in adults. Package is quite acceptable and have seen no problems with the footage all which is orginally remastered and shown in its entirity just as shown more than a decade ago.
Approved

2354827,5,B000A345DA,i loved heathcliff growing up. the show always made me laugh.it is a shame that the cartoons of today are nothing like what i watched growing up. Heathcliff is a cat that thinks he owns the street where he lives with family. Heathcliff gets into all kind of trouble. the second half of the show is with the catillac cats who live at the dump on heathcilffs street. the gang is run by Riff Raff who has the hots for Cloe who lives in a music shop with a dog named Butch. Between heathcliff and riff raff you never no what is going to happen.,1169769600,9,540,4.152380952380953
2354828,5,B000A345DA,"I watched this series as a kid and only relatively recently was reminded of it. It's a unremembered classic...at least, the second half with Riff Raff and Cleo is. I don't know about the Heathcliff parts, thinking back on it I'm pretty sure that those parts were the ones that bored me(and most people watching the show), despite Mel Blanc's voice talent. The plots are often a bit weak, and the Heathcliff character isn't dynamic enough to save them. I soon started skipping those episodes and you probably will too.

The DVD is not up to ""DVD quality."" If you just want to watch, it's acceptable, but there is no sign of any special treatment or restoration given to the original video, and you can occasionally see speckling, color bands at the edges, and muddiness in some clips. Sometimes the audio is a bit distorted, which is disappointing since the music in this show is pretty good.

Now I want the second season...",1164758400,5,924,4.662576687116564
2354829,4,B000A345DA,"I was so excited to find out HeathCliff and the Catillac Cats, one of my favorite cartoons from the 1980's was released on dvd. After viewing some of the episodes I found that they were still as entertaining as I remembered them.

Now for the problems, the picture quality could be much better. The picture has these little flicks of black and white lines in them that come and go very rapidly.(I can't think of any other way to describe them).Also, some episodes from the first disk have a wavy like appearence in the backround on the left hand side in a few scenes. I know these issues are not due to a defective copy as several people I know have copies that due the same thing. If you are willing to overlook these small problems and you love Heathcliff then I would recommened buying this DVD set.",1154044800,5,802,4.418918918918919
2354830,5,B000A345DA,"The cartoon: This is the first season from the syndicated cartoon that ran from around 1985 to 1988, and then was picked up by Nickelodeon (where I remember watching it as a kid). It was produced by DiC, and the animation was farmed to famous anime company Tokyo Movie Shinsha. While it's not movie quality, the animation is definitely several cuts above the quality level of TV cartoons on average. Heathcliff is voiced by cartoon legend Mel Blanc, and there are several other familiar animation voices in the cast. I personally have fond memories of watching this cartoon as a kid, but overall I think it's held up well.

The DVD: This is a four disc set made by Shout Factory with 24 episodes total. The full episodes are there, with the intro, commercial bumpers, one Heathcliff and one Catillac Cats segment per episode, the obligatory 80s morality segment at the end where Heathcliff gives a blurb about caring for your pets, then the closing. The episodes are arranged in chronological order by the date they aired. The pilot is on here too, though for some reason it was #18 in rotation. There are extras on discs 1-3, the first one being the most interesting by far. It's an interview with the current Heathcliff cartoonist. Heathcliff's creator George Gately retired in 1999 and passed away two years later, leaving his nephew Peter Gallagher to continue the comic. Peter discusses the history of the comic and gives a short tutorial on how to draw Heathcliff. On disc #2, there is a strip gallery with one comic from each year up until 2005. Disk #3 has the last segment, the promo clips that were used to sell the show to independant stations. IMHO this is the worst out of all the extras, since it just has clips from cartoons that are already on the discs, sans voices.

My only beef with this DVD is the extras, in that there's not much on the show other than the clips of cartoons you'll watch on the discs, and absolutely nothing on the Catillac Cats. While Mel Blanc and Stan Jones have passed away, there are people who worked on the show still working in the animation business. Hopefully there will be more on the show itself if they release future seasons. I also noticed a short hitch in the sound, but it was during one of the commercial bumpers so you don't really miss anything. My gripes basically boil down to nitpicks, and I recommend it, especially if you watched it as a kid.

9.5 out of 10 dumped garbage cans.",1140048000,6,2442,4.583524027459954
2354831,4,B000A345DA,"At least one of my favourite 80's Tv cartoon is on Dvd. Produced by Dic(Inspector Gadget,Dennis the Menace) Heathcliff and the Cadillac Cats aka Gang and Co presents a orange tabby with too much attitude. Voiced by legendary Mel Blanc this practical joker is always playing pranks on everyone to satisfy her feline love Sonya. Also he meshes with Spike the local bulldog. He lives with the Nutmegs a human family with 3 members:Grandpa,Grandma and Iggy Nutmeg their nephew.

The Catillac Cats(aka Gang & Co) presents a gang of street cats that live on a junkyard. They are leaded by Riff-Raff a short cat who has a girlfriend the long and pretty pussycat Cleo and has 3 sidekicks:Hector,Mungo and Wordsworth. The 3 are always in and out of trouble to satisfy Cleo demands.

The show is filled with funny parodies and cameos of other Dic characters(Inspector Gadget).The only flaw is the ausence of any CC or Subtitles which are not very important(the cartoon is intended for kids +8 yo).

Also are included the original commercial breaks and the pet tips.

A nice set. I hope the complete series will be released soon.

As well all Dic cartoons(Inspector Gadget,Dennis the Menace).

C.O.P.S. complete series 1 is on the way.",1129852800,5,1224,4.860576923076923
2354832,5,B000A345DA,"Finally a good eighties reissue!! This set actually is everything from the original episodes! From the theme song to the right back to the episode clips everything is here just like it was back in '84/'85 minus the commercials ;) Seems most cartoons from the eighties that have recently come out on dvd are missing key parts such as proper opening closing credits voice changes and other bad annoying things. But, fear not this set is exactly is how they were shown back then! This is one of the few cartoons that wasn't out every Saturday (then in the late eighties everyday in the afternoon) that wasn't messed up because there was no toys to dictate how the show should be made vs action toy cartoons (i.e. thundercats is a good example of that.) One can enjoy watching this in nostalgia of your childhood while enjoying it with your children now! Kid's of today and yesterday will find Heathcliff and the Riff Raff Gangs escapades quite enjoyable and funny! Oh yeah they even include the pet tips on this which is cool too!",1128384000,18,1027,4.617486338797814

 me and my brother ar big fans of the  catillac cats,

thinking I would never see them again

now I own a copy of seson one,

the movies the fair the park

and go on date,

they live in a junk yard

but made there homes from the junk

to live in,

fiff raff  he has his cool pad

made from an old air plane

with a fridge and bed,

he never has to pay rent lucky guy,

and the gang has a cool catillac

they keep repairing to take them

out for a spin, on land and sea

as it converts in to a boat,

I was a teen when I wach this show

so to see the cats had to make the best with what

thay have is like true life,

cartoons like this is more interesting

then some of the space fantasy cartoons I seen from  the 80's

well I can't wait to get the next box set

to have all there stories

thank you shout factory for making

the cats and Co. live again, on DVD.",1127433600,3,1042,3.6666666666666665
2354834,5,B000A345DA,"My younger brother and I watched this cartoon growing up in the 1980s. Because it wasn't a superblockbuster (GI JOE..etc) I am glad that it is being released on DVD.

Even though we never figured out why Iggy Nutmeg (the young boy in the ""Heathcliff"" segments) always was dressed up while Jennifer went casual and Grandma and Grandpa also looked (for their generation) informal, the series was great. Heathcliff was a cat who lived with the Nutmegs and, although generally well behaved, and wanting to impress his girlfriend Sonia (also a cat) got into trouble around the neighborhood.

He obviously wasn't content with being just a housecat because Heathclif was always cooking up some kind of 'get-rich-quick' scheme, but the family always forgave him and loved him exactly for who he was.

I loved the car which the Cadilac Cats had, it litterally changed into anything. Sure they lived in a junkyard and knew how to fend for themselves if need be, but the Cadilac Cats weren't hooligans. They were usually well-mannered cats and their leader Rif-Raf, honestly wanted nothing more than to be with his beloved Cleo, who worked at a music store. Plus (again to the perspective of a little kid) their makeshift house from an old airplane looked really cool.

I hope that whoever took the initiative to bring the series to DVD also included the theme song. Many years later, the lyrics and beat are still memorable.",1122768000,18,1414,4.854771784232365

The theme song, the original commercial bumpers, the pet care tips, and all the adventure & mischief these wild, cool, and crazy cats get themselves into.  You also get extras that delve into the origins and history of Healthcliff, both the character and the cartoon series itself.  It doesn't get any better than this.  I've heard that CJE's release doesn't have all the things I mentioned above (somebody please correct me if I'm wrong), so that's want ultimately cinched it for me.
