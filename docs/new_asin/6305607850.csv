7892076,3,6305607850,"This documentary has some great information on new and unclassified military objectives from the U.S. arsenal. However, if you're looking for one-on-one cockpit views and interviews with pilots this isn't where you want to start. There was almost too much information and not enough inside commentary. Since I am a jetaholic, I really wanted to see more of the inside of the cockpit and listen to the pilots talk to each other, and to AWACS, and feel the g-force of the maneuvers. I also would liked to have seen more strategic action plans,(within limits of military intelligence), you know, more war stuff. This was basically a mediocre demo for military aircraft and other machines and artilary.",1044489600,,698,5.025862068965517
7892077,5,6305607850,"Although the information presented here is not Y2K current (the DVD shows were released in 1998), Firepower 2000 is a great collection of info for the price.
All video footage is filmed on location in the field or in training exercises.  Covered are current weapons and a few major future projects.  While it doesn't go ""in depth"" on any one systems, what makes Firepower 2000 great is it does ""cover a lot of the bases"" in the one to two hours on each DVD.
Firepower 2000 is presented under two approaches: ""show-off"" of weapons and ""threats and countermeasures.""
The Land ""Battlefield"" DVD contains footage taken at a MidEast armor show were various countries ""show off"" their armor for export sales.  You'll see T-80UDs, T-84s, T-72S, BMP-3s and other armor move and fire their weapons along the obstacle course.  The footage is very impressive to see the mobility and speed of such heavy armor.  Also included are Paladin and MLRS firing their artillery and Apache attack helicopters firing in the range.  All footage is pretty up close and not taken at a distance. There is talk and footage of active defense, ERA armor, SAMs, IR jammers, and mine survivability.  A few computer graphics is included to help the viewer understand the concept.
The Navy DVD talks about US Navy carrier battle groups and the carrier aircraft.  Covered are the future Arsenal Ship, Marines and their equipment, amphibious ships, NATO carriers and Russian ships, countermeasures against mines, anti-ship missiles, UAVs, Harrier jump jet, and submarines.  Discussed is the role of stealth in ship design (Sea Shadow and European frigates) and if it's practical.
The Air DVD covers current aircraft such as the F-15, F-15E, F-16, SU-27, Tornado, MIG-29, F1 Mirage, and new upcoming variants such as JSF, Gripen, Mirage 2000, F-22, and the Eurofighter.  The footage of these planes performing maneuvers is great, as is the video and description on missiles and bombs carried by these aircraft.
""Fast Strike"" talks about how the US Military will respond to a crisis with airborne, naval, and air power.  Covered are the B-2, F-117A, B-52, B-1, Tomahawk cruise missiles, hovercrafts, AAAVs, UAVs, spy satellites, and the V-22.  It presents current US weaknesses in mounting a ""Fast Strike"" and how the US hopes to remedy this with future programs.
Firepower 2000 goes deeper than the general glossing over of what these weapons do.  Included are comments and opinions from experts such as Bill Sweetman and Jane's defense magazine authors as to why they are designed in this way.  The ""threats and countermeasures"" are covered in good detail such as anti-ship missiles are used against aircraft carriers and what the US Navy did to prepare for this threat.  Or how stealth is or is not important to an aircraft.  There are some debates...one expert saying stealth is needed and another saying it's not.
One thing is for sure, despite all the color photos in great military books, nothing beats seeing how the actual weapon moves and fires on the TV screen.
For the price, Firepower 2000 sums up a lot of information covered in many expensive defense magazines.
The only downside is that it's not Y2K current.  There is talk of the F-111, A-7, and A-6 Intruder, aircraft all since retired in the US military.  Pretty minor stuff.  Firepower 2000 is probably one of the best and cheapest up-to-date videos on current worldwide weapon systems.",989539200,13,3419,4.987676056338028
7892078,5,6305607850,"Firepower 2000 is a great military information DVD collection for the price.
This isn't a video about specs and performance, but tells what the weapons can do and their purpose. The info isn't just general but pretty descriptive and informative.
All footage is taken on field training exercises or ""arms shows"" in where the vehicles are moving and ""showing off.""  There isn't any video of a still vehicle crowded with civilians gawking at it.  Therefore, you see the vehicles in motion and in their natural environment.
""High-tech Battlefield"" takes you to an Mid-East arms show.  There you see the T-80, T-84, and T-72S speed around the tank course, shoot, and show off their systems.  The DVD also contains footage of artillery, AAA, and the newest anti-tank helicopters in training exercises, shooting off missiles and maneuvering.  Basically a real showcase of land and helo vehicles, the ideas behind their creation, ERA, active defense, and mine survivability.
""High-tech Navy"" spotlights carriers of the USA and UK.  Also included are the various destroyers, cruisers, submarines, and frigates of the Western and Russian navies.  Amphibious ships, the new Arsenal Ship, and the ship stealh is also covered as are mines, carrier aircraft, and anti-ship torpedoes.  This DVD shows ""checks and balances"" of ships and weapons and missiles...this is the carrier...this is the defense against it...anti-ship missile.  This is an amphib...this is the mine against it.  Interesting stuff.
""Digital Dogfight"" follows ""High-Tech Battlefield.""  Various planes are showcased such as the Mig-29, Gripen, JSF, F-15 and F-16, F-117A, Harrier, and air tankers and AWACS.  Also described are some ordnance and future systems like the F-22 and UACVs.
""Fast Strike"" talks about how the US will respond to a crisis.  Included are the bombers, ships, airborne, and naval forces that will be used.  Also covered are future systems such as the V-22 and AAAV.
As expected, Firepower 2000 isn't year 2000 current, more like 1996-1998.  Included are A-6 and F-111s which have been retired in the late 1990s.
Still, the information presented and the actual footage of vehicles and crafts in their element and ""showing off"" makes this a great value for the price.",988329600,,2242,5.240896358543417
