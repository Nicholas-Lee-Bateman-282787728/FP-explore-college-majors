Film = three (3) stars; restoration = 4.5 stars; cinematography = four (4) stars; subtitles =3.5 stars; music = two (2) stars.  Director Kenji Mizoguchi's fascination with classical literature from and dramas originally written for the Japanese puppet theater (that later became stage plays) during the Edo period couldn't be more obvious.  ""Chikamatsu"" is a pen name (not a place in Japan!) of a playwright who created puppet dramas but is probably best remembered for his domestic plays of love and suicides written in the early 18th Century that seemed to cater to women audiences.  Mizoguchi's scenario starts with a purely accidental romantic encounter and continues (through many twists and turns) as a high socioeconomic romantic barrier (between the wife of a wealthy merchant and an employee) slowly dissolves even in the face of institutionalized execution for adultery.  Once again, the Director spins a tale where the male protagonist's happiness is derived from a woman's sacrifice and the emphasis (from personal experience?) is on the attraction that some ""strong"" women have for ""weak,"" impoverished men with close to zero prospects.  While this is not a morality photo-play, Mizoguchi stresses (perhaps to the extreme?) that adultery (real or imagined) was a big deal in Japan's  pre-modern social system.  Adultery laws were a bit tricky though.  Husbands could have (were expected to have?) unmarried female lovers.  Wives who took on male lovers (married or single) were deemed to have committed adultery.  Both lovers faced execution for their actions.  ""Proof"" of adultery could be based on heresy, gossip or other circumstantial evidence (and motivated by business jealousy or revenge).  The husband and families of adulterers could be thrown in jail and have their assets confiscated.  Even villages the adulterers came from could be punished! (It would seem that same-sex adulterous relationships were not legally addressed, since, apparently, they were assumed never to occur!)  Criterion's restoration is outstanding!  Cinematography is very good (often due to the camera subtly ""floating"" on a crane.  Subtitles are a bit long and often fail to fully capture the Kensai-Ben flavor of line deliveries.  Music uses only Japanese instruments.  While this may be commendable, performances are uneven with percussion used more to provide irritating acoustic-shocks than to enhance scene richness.  Recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1478563200,,2651,5.532338308457711
