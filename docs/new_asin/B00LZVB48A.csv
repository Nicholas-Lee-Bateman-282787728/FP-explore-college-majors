If you are like me, you forgot about the other films. There is no character build up for Eddie (Simon Phillips) but there really doesn't need to be as it develops nicely. There are flashbacks to the earlier films in the beginning, but it didn't really help me, and I have seen the films. It isn't until they mention the credit card scam, that I recalled the movies, which really wasn't necessary to enjoy this feature. Phew!

Eddie helps Mike avenge the killing of his wife by going against Russian mobster Dimitri (Akbar Kurtha). Not to give too much away, but Mike dies in the first scene. Damien (Josh Myers) who claims to be a friend of Mike's wants Eddie to tell him who was Mike's killer. Eddie balks at the idea, but then the title ""Revenge in Rio"" kinda lets you know what happens...like naming a book ""Return of the King.""

Be that as it may, Simon Phillips plays a great Eddie, reminding me of a British Paul Giamatti. The film is best described as an entertaining light crime drama.
