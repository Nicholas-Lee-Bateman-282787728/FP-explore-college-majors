7575791,5,B019H4OUX2,"Plays on my US Xbox one just fine. Great flick, but they did not put much effort into the transfer but I think fans of the movie are just lucky to have it on DVD and not have to watch that VHS copy any more. Also this cover is way better than the US ""The Quest"" VHS cover.",1465344000,2,272,3.706896551724138

8745158,5,B019H4OUX2,"Frog Dreaming was a movie, even as an Australian who was a kid in the 80's, I hadn't heard of before coming across it today.  But it's a really fun film, and easily has the fun of Goonies and other child led character adventure films.  Obviously they cast the lead actor kid from E.T. (Henry Thomas) to try and get an audience.  An American in the lead role (it's set in rural Victoria, Australia), maybe back in the day wouldn't have gone down with Australian audiences, but his character being one is explained as being an orphan who for reasons never really gone into in any depth, lives with his parents' friend, some sort of tradesman with a huge workshop, who promised he would look after him and is his legal guardian, but clearly hasn't got much experience with kids.  Although he'll stick up for him against any adult unfairly picking on or slandering him.  Which a lot of the adults do, such as the town cop or a school girl's father, seeing him as a bad influence on their kids, since he likes to invent stuff, such as adapting his bike to go on the rail lines so he can get to school quicker. This outlook on life not caring about the rules of society of course impresses Wendy the small town's hot girl amongst those his age (Rachel Friend).  He likes her too but seems oblivious to the way she looks at him. Wendy also has a cool little sister Jane, who has an 80's bad fringe hairstyle, who is perfectly aware of the situation between the two of them, and drops cool lame ""dad humour"" type observations and comes backs to lines in conversations.  Not all are politically correct which is refreshing and highlights what the 80's was like in Australia. As was the fact kids could go wherever they wanted, ride bikes, jump in water fully clothed without worrying about runiing expensive phones and so forth. But the dialogue is so cool. In fact there's a lot witty lines throughout the film from a number of characters both adult and child, which just makes this film a lot of fun.

The film probably would have been more successful with a better title than Frog Dreaming which to me envisions some sort of princess kissing frog type film, which of course this is nothing of the sort. Frog Dreaming refers to the fact that Cody is trying to find out what is living in a waterhole he Wendy and Jane discovered that isn't on the local maps, where Cody believes some sort of Loch Ness legend style creature scared an adult friend of his whose corpse they found to death.  The creature is part of Aboriginal mythology, in that region known as frog dreaming. Donkegin is some sort of Bunyip thing, that Cody must infiltrate remote Aboriginal communities in the area to learn more about. This 1986 film was also renamed The Quest, as well as The Go-Kids in some markets.  If you've got a multizone DVD player, you might want to check other regions under those alternative titles. This product being reviewed is a region 4 DVD by the way.

I just found this film a lot of fun. You will no doubt work out what Donkegin is early on in the film but that doesn't matter. Even though it's a kid market aimed film, there's plenty to keep adults entertained.  Plus you can throw in the seeing some Australian actors when they were younger element.  There's plenty of things to bring up nostalgic memories for anyone who was a kid or older in the 80's.  The Australian accents are a bit stronger than reality, I'm guessing they were trying to sell this to the Americans on the heels of Crocodile Dundee that came out the same year.  There's also lots of Australian animals randomly appearing in between scenes with humans. The aboriginals seem a little closer to American Indians in clothing, customs and behaviour as well.

It's a shame this movie wasn't more successful, as it is a damn good film.  Especially when you consider, Australia produced a large number of very average movies in the 80's that made more money than this one.  My advice is watch this one, just for the entertainment factor of the jokes in the dialogue alone.",1487721600,,4032,4.522696011004126
