3778066,5,B001RPZDWC,"I have been looking forward to a DVD production of ""Castor et Pollux"" for some years. I bought the William Christie/Les Arts Florissants recording of the 1737 version of the opera in the early 1990s and it has been a much loved recording in my collection since then, I still cannot imagine a better recording of the work. In 2004, I bought the Aradia Ensemble's recording of the 1754 version of ""Castor & Pollux"" on the NAXOS label. Although it didn't feature big names from the Early Music world in the cast, it was a fine recording of the work and it was very interesting to hear how Rameau ""re-jigged"" the work seventeen years later.

I bought and enjoyed Christophe Rousset's DVD of Rameau's ""Zoroastre"" and my only complaint about it was the occasional overhead shots and a slightly less than formidable singer in the role of Zoroastre himself.

This new ""Castor & Pollux"" is a very fine interpretation and what we see and hear is the result of a lot of hard work, rehearsing and performing the work on stage. The cast is excellent, although, only the two leading ladies were previously well known to me. Vronique Gens and Anna Maria Panzarella, are, of course, completely at home in the operas of Rameau and they tend to steal the show. Signorina Panzarella is particularly touching in the role of Tlare and mademoiselle Gens throws herself into the role of the hapless scheming Phb with great aplomb. I honestly feel that the ladies could have quite easily have swapped roles and the show would have been just as convincing.

Finnur Bjarnason is Castor and Henk Neven is Pollux and both of these young men have fine voices and they deliver their us fine interpretations of their characters.

The costumes are quite stylish and the general look of the show is somewhat reminiscent of John Eliot Gardiner's DVD production of Gluck's ""Alceste"". The sets are rather ""Bauhaus"" in their design and it is worth watching the documentary, ""To serve this big spectacle"" on DVD 2 for Pierre Audi's comments on the production. (PS: after watching ""Cadmus et Hermione"" by Vincent Dumestre and La Pome Harmonique, I only wish that such an approach had been adopted for this production and I wish that Gens and Panzarella had swapped roles)

All things considered, a very worthy addition to the catalogue of Rameau operas on DVD. I only hope Rousset, Christie or Minkowski present us with DVD recordings of ""Hippolyte et Aricie"" and ""Dardanus"" very soon.

And please, next time, try to not use Anna Maria Panzarella, monsieur Rousset! She was okay here, but her voice isn't what it used to be.",1243468800,22,2585,4.758928571428571
8338572,5,B001RPZDWC,"Finally, a contemporary European production of a Baroque opera that does not offend or outrage.  The key word which seems to have eluded the rabid ""experts, such as the reviewer in an British rag-blog called ""Capriccio"", is SPARTAN.  Minimalist staging, minimalist, if  sumptuous, costumes; superb singing from a cast of fine singers who may be never known in the USA, and superb choreography--.  All in all, most refreshing--at times i felt I was in my aunt's terrace, full of song birds.  The austere mise-en scene corresponds to the fact that Spartans are involved--though they reminded me of primitive Cretan statues.  In other words, pay no attention to detractors and judge by yourself.  Thanks to the Audi/Rousset team!",1458259200,,726,5.153846153846154

8338574,3,B001RPZDWC,"Castor et Pollux has been in my top 10 favorite operas list since I was a teen. I've always loved the story and the music and have longed to see it actually performed, because opera is meant to not only be listened to, but WATCHED.

THIS production, however, was a painful disappointment for me. The dreadful costumes, the unimaginative sets, the confusing choreography - it was not only heartbreaking, but irritating at some points.

The performers do a fabulous job - if you close your eyes and just listen, it's a wonderful experience. But visually, the production detracts from the story and I was so frustrated, I turned it off.

I sincerely hope they do a different reproduction of this glorious opera. The story is fabulous and Rameau's music is wonderful. But I would not recommend this DVD if you want to see/experience the opera play out. You're better off paying to see a better production performed live.",1397088000,3,916,4.784810126582278
8338575,3,B001RPZDWC,"I think that most reviewers are right to enjoy beautiful music but find the production irritating. Some think the poor production is another case of modern ideas that are inherently wrong for an older opera. I think instead that it's a case of old-fashioned ideas which are not even understood.
I'll try to explain my thinking as briefly as I can.
One reviewer rightly refers to the Bauhaus in relation to the simplified geometry of the sets. This kind of minimalism began in the 1920's and followed Bauhaus ideas until about 1950. (Art history starts to stop calling art Modern in the 50's, changing to Contemporary and Post-Modern.)
The dresses immediately recall Martha Graham, who began work in the 1920s and performed until about 1950. When the dancing begins, the movements resemble Graham with added arm movements that resemble some dances by Pina Bausch.
Google the Martha Graham Dance Company and there are a row of photos showing Grahams use of clothing as an extension of her body, as well as showing muscular men in contrast. Those of you who may have been lucky enough to see the Graham Company on tour a couple of years ago will know that her dances are still very great, and will know why Graham was the Picasso of modern dance.
Graham, re-interpreting Greek myth, used beautiful surreal sets by Noguchi. She related her vividly emotional dancing to the sets, to the music, to the story, to the other dancers and to the scuptural image she created in her clothing.
In the staging of this opera the dancers don't relate much to the dresses, and in fact, often seem to be tripping over the bottom of the skirts. The flailing arms don't add to the image. Pina Bausch, who turned Graham into Post-Modern dance, used meaning or lack of meaning, to change the meaning of life for a lot of people. (You can see Bausch's homage to Graham in a DVD of Gluck's Orfeo. Unfortunately, though very good, it is not characteristic of her greatest and most infuential work, and even more unfortunately she left only a few filmed fragments when she died last year.)
So the sets are bland Bauhaus, the dances bland Graham and Bausch out of context. The music is not given a re-inforced context.
When Graham or Bausch modernized or Post-Modernized something they gave it a new point of view and added to the message. New opera productions can also be great when what they add new ideas and new emotions. Failure comes when other people's ideas are copied without understanding the purpose, Then you have bad jokes, false emotions, pointless violence and bland cliches.
Very simplified: Modern changed the appearance of art and our concepts of beauty; Post-Modern addresses how thinking and feeling through art relates to society in all the range of art ideas and art uses.",1334102400,3,2767,4.778705636743215
8338576,5,B001RPZDWC,"I generally do not care for ""modern"" stageings of older works but in this case I was completely absorbed by the totality of this production. That said I add one proviso; the choreography was horrible. It was the same frenetic flailing of feet, legs, hands etc that we had in Zoroastre; looking more like an exercise video for a Jenny Craig weight-reduction parlor. However here in this production there is, fortunately, not enough of that dance-quack to lose a star. Yes this is certainly among the best productions of a Rameau I've yet seen. On several viewings I'm really impressed by the intense drama of the story and the music. It is certainly on a par with his first piece ""Hippolyte et Aricie"" and deserves the designationation of Tragedie Lyrique. The cast is excellent. The two ladies Gens and Panzarella are well known in this type of music and are stellar in their roles (and their French). The men are also well cast and carry off their characterizations exceptionally well. They are both virile and affecting. When I first saw the sets I said ""Oh no, not Eurocrap again"" but they were amazingly well done and the austere stage was in keeping with Greek drama as were the costumes. (Yes, as pointed out by one reviewer they reminded one of the Alceste seen a few years ago.) All in all this is truly a treasure of taste and accuracy in bringing back to vivid life this Baroque gem.",1329264000,2,1393,4.620967741935484
8338577,3,B001RPZDWC,"I had high expectations for this release but was disappointed with the unsightly sets, off-putting choreography, unimaginative costumes and a lot of other problems with the production. As someone else already noted, perhaps this production would have been suitable for the blind. It truly is a distraction and interferes with the music. I was not only bored but actually even irritated.  Such a pity to mindlessly spoil a beautiful piece of music...My perception of the singing and the acting was affected and marred by this strange production, which is, in my opinion, incompatible with the true essence of the music here.",1321660800,8,623,5.1683168316831685
8338578,3,B001RPZDWC,"I'll tell you. It was the choreographer. He insisted on assigning each character a dancer who would double as themselves. The dancer's role was to do all the acting through the awkward and laborious dancing. This means that while the events are actually happening to the singers, they can't act out about it. This was a grave error which manifested in a tedious, monotonous staging. You don't get to see any of the rage by those that have been crossed, nor do you get to see any sort of real jealousy or insanity by the one doing the crossing. The best scene is the funeral scene with the popular aria Tristes aprez. Under the proper direction, this opera could move you to tears. I love Rameau and all his work and this production put me to sleep. I so badly wanted to like this. If this was any one's first experience with a Rameau opera they would certainly be put off. The saving grace of this production is the perfect performance by the orchestra. Get the CD instead. Forget this and buy Platee by Rameau. It's the most entertaining piece of work that I own and everyone I've shown it to agrees.",1253404800,25,1101,4.455445544554456
8338579,3,B001RPZDWC,"I love Rameau.  I am giddy that I live in a time when his forgotten operas are being produced again by major companies.  But I am having trouble giving this more than 3 stars.

The modern choreography is just AWFUL - with finger pointing like airplane landing signals and all dances seem to be ""fight"" choreography.  Both of these unpleasant elements were a part of the choreography in Rameau's ""Zoroastre,"" but only parts (same choreographer, but even worse here).  In this production they take over entirely, and there is so much dance in French Opera that it makes the dances very tedious to the point of turning it off.  Here we also have the men dressed like women and women dressed like men which is part of this same era trend of choreography.  At least I should be thankful that at no point were they in their underwear, which also is very popular right now.  UGH.

The production concept in general really got in my way for this production, too ""space age"" neon light tubes, architectural costumes, braided unisex hair.  Just ugly, and very very monotonous for a long opera, as Rameau opera are.

Unfortunately, the recording of the singers also starts poorly (strong through most of it), so in a production where the music was absolutely the saving grace, it is also somewhat marred.

And the music IS the strength here, magnificent Direction by Christophe Rousset.  This orchestra is so good, I'd be happy to hear them alone for the whole thing.  The leading lady seems to be struggling a bit with some of the vocal style of this period, but the voices are, of course, top notch.  The singer in the marvelous role of Pheobe is a stand out in every respect... Rameau & Lully do make the most of the jilted ladies.  The choral elegie and then leading lady's solo at the midoint of Act Two are beautiful.  The chorus in this production is magnificent, and seated in the pit with the orchestra.

PLEASE SOMEONE, GIVE US SOME LEGIT HISTORICAL PRODUCTIONS OF RAMEAU!!!!  It is now so rare, it would be ""new"" and ""different.""",1251590400,23,2029,4.633053221288516
8338580,5,B001RPZDWC,"The staging of this 18th C opera seria, by De Nederlandse Opera with Pierre Audi directing, is suspiciously similar to the 10-year-old Brian Large (correction: Robert Wilson) staging of Gluck's Alceste: the same faded blue ambience, with muted red lighting; similar robes for costumes; odd squares and cubes for sets; super-stately, hieratic poses and movements. I had mixed feelings about that Alceste; in the end, only the music worked for me. Once again, it's the music that makes the show in Rameau's ""Castor et Pollux"", but there are good things to be said about the staging and five-star raves about the musical delivery.

First, the singers. This is an opera about men, and the legendary Twins, Castor and Pollux, are real men, both in their robust voices and in their presences. Finnur Bjarnason (Castor) dominates both physically and vocally whenever he's on stage; that's appropriate to the tale. But Henk Neven (Pollux) sings with an emotional depth that expands and ripens as his character's nobility is revealed. Basso Nicolas Teste (Jupiter) is properly severe and all-potent vocally, though his physical presence seems somewhat less than Olympian. Altogether, the three male characters are superb in their musical balance and ensemble; for once, it's obvious that rehearsal time was adequate for the production. There are also three women in the tale: Telaire, whom both brothers love; her sister Phebe, who lusts for Castor and whose sorcery sets up the tragedy; and the ambiguous Cleone, confidante of both sisters. Veronique Gens (Phebe) steals the show vocally; her voice is never strained, her ornaments are effortlessly graceful, her vocal affect is spot-perfect for the emotional load of each of her recitations. Anna Maria Panzarella (Telaire) and Judith van Wanrou (Cleone) sing very well, with rich ringing timbre; it's only in comparison with Gens that they pale slightly. One of the major virtues of this cast is that all the principals sing with the same ""historically informed' vocal technique, as if they'd all studied with the same teacher. Rameau's music per se depends on such unity of ensemble for its grace, and unfortunately such generous togetherness of singers can't always be depended on. This performance would be vocally impressive on a CD also.

Then, the singers as actors. The first scenes are stiff. That's what the director called for. It's not quite as tedious as a Bayreuth production of Wagner; nobody sings while staggering backwards a foot a note. But it's scarcely engaging. Then, I think, the singers -- all of them -- begin to become engaged themselves in the meaning of their character's words and in the divine humanity they are enacting. Let's just say that they 'override' their direction and commit themselves to being who their recitations say they are. They generate a lot of drama, a lot of empathy, which builds in the final acts to a theatrical climax. One actually cares about their fates. Or to be precise, one cares about Castor and Pollux. As I said before, this is an opera about men. The most potent emotion in it is brotherly fidelity. The two brothers are united in immortality. Telaire remains on stage in this production but she's no longer relevant, and Phebe is lost somewhere in gloomy Hades.

Les Talens Lyriques, conducted by harpisichordist Christophe Rousset, play with the utmost precision and delicacy throughout. The instrumental writing in this opera seria is restrained and subordinated to the singing, but it has to be elegant, and it is. I agree with other critics that ""Castor et Pollux"" is Rameau's masterpiece in the genre of opera seria. It's far more than the usual French Baroque suite of arias and dances; it's a taut, coherent, complete piece of music.

Finally, back to the staging. Hmmm. It ""grew"" on me. Or perhaps I began to see and hear through it. My wife thought it was ""beautiful"" and for once I didn't have to wake her up for the last act.",1251417600,,3944,4.998477929984779
8338581,1,B001RPZDWC,"Rameau's music for this opera is wonderful and it is well-performed by Les Talens Lyriques under Christophe Rousset. The vocal performances are very good, except that Panzarella screeches from time to time.

The problem with this production is that the sets are extraordinarily ugly. Yes, they're minimalist, but they're also just plain ugly and add nothing to the merits of the opera.  The costumes are mediocre at best.  Worst of all, the choreography is ugly.  The acting is quite weak as well.  In every visual respect, this production detracts from Rameau's music rather than illuminating it.

If you haven't already seen Rameau's Les Indes Galantes, get that instead, or try a CD version of this opera.  I recommdend skipping this monstrosity.",1245715200,11,749,5.140495867768595
