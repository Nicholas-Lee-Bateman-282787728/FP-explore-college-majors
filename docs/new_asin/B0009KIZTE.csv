8062669,4,B0009KIZTE,"I've seen at least a dozen Lon Chaney films, some better than others, but ""Flesh and Blood"" stands out for me as one of the better ones. Lon Chaney himself, in comparison with a few of his later roles, is remarkably restrained as David Webster, a man wrongfully accused for a crime he did not commit, who escapes from prison to reunite with his family. He doesn't overplay his part, but manages to convey perfectly the emotions of a man tortured by the fact that he can never reveal his true identity to his daughter, played by Edith Roberts, without endangering her happiness. It's great to see him playing a father rather than his usual unrequited lover role, and in that respect, this movie gives him a bit more room to stretch out in.

The movie does lag a bit in spots, but overall it's a very well done silent film and one well worth watching, especially if you're a Chaney fan.",1314057600,6,884,4.45679012345679
8062670,4,B0009KIZTE,"This is a melodrama taking place in Chinatown, with the escaped convict of 15 years imprisonment David Webster, played by Lon Chaney, seeking revenge upon the plutocratic criminal who framed him. Complicating this situation is his daughter's betrothal to the son of his underhanded enemy. Integration of complicated plot factors is handled well by first-time director Irving Cummings, who went on to direct many superb films. Chaney's performance as a faux cripple expands as the film progresses, his unique face expressive of his inner struggles as he wars against the frustration of dealing with evil elements who have the upper hand. The work benefits from fine supporting cast members, including Noah Beery as Li Fang, the Chinese ""boss"" whose loyalty to Webster is steadfast, and Ralph Lewis as Fletcher Burton, Webster's principal foe. Several scenes revolve around children, and although there is no direct connection between them and the storyline, these help in marshaling sympathy for the leading characters. The scenario is actually somewhat complex, but the measured pace set by the veteran actor Cummings is appropriate to permit development. For a 79 year old film, and not remastered, the print is quite good, even when contemporary standards are applied, with seldom a ""jump"". A pipe organ accompaniment lacks nothing, and is perfectly synchronous with each scene of this largely overlooked silent work.",1163635200,,1419,5.367713004484305
