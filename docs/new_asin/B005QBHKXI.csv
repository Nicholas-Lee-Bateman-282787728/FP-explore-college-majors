8483067,3,B005QBHKXI,"But this movie was about middle of the road.  Started off strong and then meandered a bit.  It's a whodunit and smuggling story that takes place in Calcutta, India, in the 1940s.  Worth a watch.",1508889600,,194,4.485714285714286
8483068,1,B005QBHKXI,"Movie takes place in Denmark, dialogue a little hard to understand. I thought it would be an American noir and was disappointed.",1492905600,,128,4.863636363636363
8483069,4,B005QBHKXI,"Most of the negative reviews seem to have been made on a previous copy.  I have no real complaint, except the picture seemed faded  at  times  and there were some long gaps between a few scenes.  On  the whole, I found the sound and picture to be adequate  with no trouble
regarding subtitles.  Recommend  this  copy over previous versions though a bit overpriced.",1470268800,,364,4.634920634920635

8483071,3,B005QBHKXI,"This video looks as if it was copied from a VCR, the quality can only be described as, adequate. I have been madly in love with Gail Russell since I was 10 years old and have been searching for a copy of this film forever.  While I am extremely grateful to the person I ordered from; since I do now own a copy, if I were you I would wait until Criterion or Olive Films, or anybody, might re-issue this film. Alan Ladd and William Bendix are also 2 of my favorites and John Farrow, one of my favorite directors.  Unless you're a Gail Russell fanatic like me, forget about it. Anyone have any info on a possible re-issue or a somewhat pristine copy of this film?",1415577600,2,660,4.188976377952756
8483072,5,B005QBHKXI,"I am liking everything I see with Alan Ladd in it.  He was the beautiful, blonde actor--the Robert Redford of that period.
I like the quiet quality about it, an intenseness about him.  I was at the age that I missed seeing his films when I was
young, and lived in a small town, so I am discovering what I missed years ago.",1407456000,,322,4.095238095238095
8483073,2,B005QBHKXI,"The title says it all.  Took forever to get and it's a home DVD dub of a poor quality VHS . At least I
was able to see a movie unavailable elsewhere.",1371859200,2,149,3.65625
8483074,2,B005QBHKXI,"the disc looked new but the quality of the picture was very poor, i will not be a return purchaser. a dissapointing copy of a good picture",1356307200,10,138,4.148148148148148
