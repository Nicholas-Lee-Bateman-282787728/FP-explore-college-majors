4133911,3,B003KO1JSA,"Pretty interesting look at the occult--the various meanings, background, misunderstandings--broken down by interviews and narrations. Nice use of graphics as well.",1288483200,,163,6.809523809523809
4133912,3,B003KO1JSA,"I have to admit I was a little leery about watching this film. Without really knowing much about it I pretty much had my mind made up that the occult was just something evil, dark and I didn't really want anything to do with witchcraft and such. Of course curiosity got the best of me and I decided I would take a look at this film and find out what is behind the word. Turns out it isn't quite as creepy as I anticipated and like many skeptics to the subject I now have a better understanding and more objective opinion of the subject. I think the pace of the film was a tad slow. I also think some of the image sequences and opening soundtrack created an expectation that the film would be more menacing and ominous than it actually was. All in all, the documentary proved worth watching and very informational but it is definitely geared toward those with an interest in the subject matter.",1286409600,2,893,4.3532934131736525
4133913,4,B003KO1JSA,"Science and theology have forever battled, with theories offered from both to explain all things unique. The notion of magic is either ridiculed or honored; and those seeking proof of it usually do not find it.

They may, however, finally succeed.

""The Occult: The Truth Behind the Word"" is an interesting contradiction (one viewers will not expect). While it speaks of magic and mysticism, it seeks also to strip away the misconceptions of those ideals. It gives its emphasis instead to history--tracing the origins of rituals and too commonly misunderstood philosophies. The intention here is to present the occult in its religious context and viewers will be pleased with the results. The experience is not filled to the typical scandal. It's instead a frank account. This allows it to transcend the usual expectations. It's worth time and consideration.

All should note the occasionally slow pacing, however. The film is offered methodically and this can be a deterrent for those who want immediate results.",1285718400,,1013,5.2024539877300615
4133914,3,B003KO1JSA,"This is an in-depth history and introduction to the occult.  Instead of making it seems spooky or evil, the film shows the viewer that occultism is nothing to be afraid of.  Throughout history there has been shamanism, ritual magick, and sacred practices that are still being practiced today.

The word ""occult"" simply means ""beyond the range of ordinary knowledge or understanding"" but over the centuries it's become synonymous with satanic worship and black magick.  Nothing could be further from the truth!

I enjoyed the parts of this film that focused on L. Ron Hubbard and Aleister Crowley.  If you're new to the subject of the occult or just want to set some fearful naysayers straight, this is a solid film to do just that.",1285286400,,731,4.854838709677419
4133915,3,B003KO1JSA,"As a survey/introduction/history of the occult, this is a good start, but for somebody already into this stuff, it might be too pedestrian.  I found the section on Aleister Crowley the most interesting, since I knew almost nothing about him.  The film traces the history of occultism, from its beginnings in animism, through the shamans, to pantheism, to monotheism, to alchemists and magicians and eventually the officers/priests/clerics of the current monotheistic religions.  It seems to me we may have come full circle, from a time when every person could ask for help from the spirits living in every thing, through a long period where special knowledge was closely held and often used to obtain power, now back to a more individualistic spiritualism, and eventually a more open, non-occult method of relating to our environment.  The film, on the other hand, points a shaky finger at the ""new shamans,"" the keepers of nuclear weapons, and the new magic of quantum physics.",1283904000,,978,5.09375

4133917,1,B003KO1JSA,"This is mostly speculation from less-than-qualified conspiracy theorists not giving facts but trying to persuade you to follow their blind, silly, and strange beliefs. The kooks on youtube have way more information and are actually entertaining.",1447804800,,245,5.833333333333333

4133919,1,B003KO1JSA,The damned music is too overpowering making this virtually impossible to enjoy or stay with there is no balance music is supposed to be played lower then the dialog. Sorry to say this is crappy film,1427932800,,198,4.527777777777778
4133920,5,B003KO1JSA,If you have even the slightest interest in the occult I think you will enjoy this film. Lots of background info and in depth analysis made this a real winner for me.  I watched it with a friend and we both were talking about it hours later.,1368835200,,240,4.1063829787234045
4133921,5,B003KO1JSA,When you are ready to go beyond what is presented to us in a our daily lives I would suggest watching this video.

4133923,3,B003KO1JSA,I thought the graphics were fantastic in this documentary. I would recommend it just for that. Also The interviews were very convincing and the controversy over all the misunderstandings makes you really put the film into perspective.,1307059200,2,234,5.351351351351352
4133924,1,B003KO1JSA,"This documentary seems incomplete.  There are only stated opinions and questions asked, I could only watched half the movie, many of which are at a basic level.  If you are at the curious stage it is a good movie to start your learning but for someone more learned in this subject hold off.",1292716800,7,290,4.452830188679245
4133925,1,B003KO1JSA,"This DvD was lame and boring. Quasi-academics giving text-book speeches on the topic of 'Occultism'.The only thing of interest said was that the 'oocult' literally means something that is seen,yet misunderstood by the lay-people of the mundane world. This dvd talk is too dry and slow. Examples are terrible and this is a terrible place to start. This was an excellent idea for a documentary,yet what a waste. If you want a good show of Aleister Crowley,watch the dvd,'In Search of Aleister Crowley',instead.",1288483200,4,508,5.132530120481928

8398801,1,B003KO1JSA,Couldn't ence make it to the 5 minute mark. The lady's explanation of a solar eclipse being the earth's shadow across the sun? Wtf?!? That's a LUNAR eclipse. Solar eclipses occur when the moon passes between earth and the sun. At least study the cue cards before going in front of the camera...,1475452800,,294,4.566037735849057
8398802,1,B003KO1JSA,I was bored at the regular fare and thought I would try a movie in an area in which I have typically had little interest. The movie confirmed my lack of interest in movies of this ilk.,1473465600,,184,4.0
