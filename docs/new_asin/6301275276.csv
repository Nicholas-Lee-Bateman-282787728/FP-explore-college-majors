7810568,4,6301275276,"The main event is a disappointment with it going just like you'd expect with Mancini trying to chase down Camacho and never quite catching him.  However! On the undercard is one of the best fights you'll ever see.  In a bout to decide who would go face Paez for the title,  Jeff Franklin an Lupe ""Little Guns"" Guiterrez fought an incredible 12 round SD that should go in your top ten.  They fought inside, outside, up and down for both fighters, neither ever giving up though it seemed at times both were done. It was so clean the referee was practically a spectator.  Imagine fighters working at a high level on the inside without tying up and drawing in the referee every 20 seconds.  If you can pick this up for cheap it's worth it just for this fight!",1341446400,,755,4.39568345323741
7810569,4,6301275276,"This guy who wrote that this fight was boring might not be a  boxing fan after all. This is a very entertaining and fast paced boxing showdown. You have no knockdowns, but I guess it was better because we got 12 full rounds of energetic boxing. Ray Mancini was always chasing Camacho, while he would move and counterpunch the brave and focused Mancini. It was the power of Boom Boom vs. the skill of Macho Camacho. Give a try to this one and you will find for yourself that it was a great fight.",1052092800,3,495,4.26595744680851

7810571,2,6301275276,"Why anyone would release this snoozer of a fight to home video is a mystery to me.  Why anyone would buy it is an even bigger one.  Camacho ran like a thief the entire fight, and Mancini was too slow to catch him.  Dull, dull, dull.",953942400,6,232,4.0
7810572,3,6301275276,"A must have for a true fight fan. Not only does the main event go the distance in a hard to score back and forth war, but the under card featured the pro-debut of Riddock ""Big Daddy"" Bowe.  So often fight  videos show case bouts that can be found on network television,  Mancini-Camacho is a hard to find treasure that you won't find on ESPN  Classic.  The only downside to this tape are the announcers. Boxing  analyst often side with the favorite and Mancini-Camacho is no exception,  round after round the announcers build up Camacho, but inside the ring  Mancini finds ways to tear him down.  The fight has no knock-downs, but  there is plenty of give and take action. Everytime you see the fight you're  liable to score it differently.",948931200,4,740,4.572519083969466
7810573,3,6301275276,"Hector Camacho and Ray Mancini battled in Reno, Nevada for the Vacant WBO Junior Welterweight Championship of the world. The prefight buildup really sets the tone for the fight to follow. These two had a history of bad blood  between them and were eager to hear the bell signaling the start of the 1st  Round. After 12 Rounds at a grueling pace, it is now time to go to the  decision. It is a split decision for the winner....Order Mancini/Camacho to  find out",946684800,3,460,4.506024096385542
