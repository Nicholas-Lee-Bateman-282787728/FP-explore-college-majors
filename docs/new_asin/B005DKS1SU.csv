4660871,5,B005DKS1SU,"My daughter is a huge Nick Jr fan so she is loving this DVD. I let her open it last night and she would've quietly watch the entire DVD if it wasn't close to bed time. The only thing missing is Peppa Pig and Bubble Guppies. Other than that, this DVD is awesome and I'm sure my 3yr old will watch this year round even though the episodes are holiday specific.",1418083200,2,358,4.056338028169014

4660878,3,B005DKS1SU,"Both my grand-daughters (5 & 2 yr. old) liked this movie, but just didn't love it. I know them well- when they love something, they watch it over & over again! But in all fairness, it might just be that they're still busy with ALL the other gifts they got for Christmas ;)",1358035200,,272,4.150943396226415

4660882,5,B005DKS1SU,"Our preschoolers love Nick Jr and this was just perfect this year for Christmas. Unlike other DVDs that you pay 12+ dollars for with only one episode, this has many half hour episodes all in one. A nice feature included is the ""play all"" at the beginning so you don't have to start after each one.",1357516800,,297,4.321428571428571
4660883,5,B005DKS1SU,"This was a Christmas gift for my 3 year old grandaughter. She loves these T.V. shows & she learns a lot from them (she can count up to 10, knows all of her shapes & colors,  knows the letters of the alphabet, can understand & speak some -a fairly good amount of- Spanish, her vocabulary is way above the level of a 3 year old, and she can read some words in books).  She amazes a lot of people & they always ask where she learns these things. We feel she enjoys herself learning from her ""friends"" on T.V. She also has their books.  I have a DVD player in my car & I have a selection of these shows on separate DVDs which she loves. Now she can see them all on 1 DVD (we use the DVD player in town & it's not always convenient to change a DVD when driving). This DVD will be especially good for the long trips we take (over 2 hours). Anyone with little ones will know how much education kids can absorb while watching something they enjoy! I highly recommend this DVD.",1356825600,,968,4.08421052631579
4660884,5,B005DKS1SU,My son loves all of the episodes on this dvd. especially Blues Clues and Wonder pets not boring at all,1356566400,,102,4.15
4660885,4,B005DKS1SU,"Nickelodeon offers great characters for kids of my daughter's age (4).  She speaks English, French Mandarin and Cantonese.  She can benefit from Ni Hao Kailan introduction to Mandarin but this DVD doesn't offer the French version of Dora (only Spanish).  It would be nice if the DVDs were available in Canada and include the French versions when available.  Otherwise, I would have rated this DVD a 5 stars.",1355961600,,407,4.9411764705882355

4660891,4,B005DKS1SU,"My 3 year old loves this video. He especially loves Dora & Diego, however, the Dora & Diego shows on this video are on other Christmas videos; in fact, I already own those videos & did not realize that when I got this. They could have added some new Dora & Diego Christmas episodes, the ones on here are a few years old. It's nice that this does have some of the new Nick shows such as Ni Hao Kai-lan & Umi Zoomi, which my son also loves. It would have been nice to have the Backyardigans on here as well.

But all in all, it is a very good video of Christmas episodes, and my son loves it! He doesn't get bored watching this & I enjoy watching it with him.",1326844800,,657,3.977272727272727
