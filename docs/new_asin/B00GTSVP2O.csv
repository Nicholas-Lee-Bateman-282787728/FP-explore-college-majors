8627422,3,B00GTSVP2O,"Jeff Beck is definitely, as Eric Clapton said, from a different planet.  This is a decent look at some of his earlier work.  Quality is so-so, but so was the equipment at the time.  I already have the live videos of The Jeff Beck Group on a separate video, making some of this redundant.  Otherwise, I would have given a higher rating.  Probably for completists.",1417305600,,362,4.507692307692308
8627423,3,B00GTSVP2O,"Some good moments of the great Beck, but the product needs more polishing. The difference in volume between periods are huge, you need to adjust the volume many times. Needs masterization! But there are great moments as well. Poor product.",1407283200,2,239,5.0
8627424,3,B00GTSVP2O,"I'm probably as big of fan of Jeff Beck as anyone, believing him to be arguably the best rock guitarist alive today.  And yes, it is nice to see all of this footage of him during his early years.  As another reviewer noted, there are four songs done with the Yardbirds, all having shown up before in various releases.  The material from the Jeff Beck Group was nice to see and hear, with four from that band.  I always thought this band was good, but for me, the weak link was the undistinguished vocals of Bobby Tench.  He's no Rod Stewart, but serviceable.  The final two tracks are excellent musically, with a dated performance with Eric Clapton doing the old blues standard Further on Up the Road.  From their appearance, it seems to have been recorded in the 80s sometime.  The last tune is a previously unseen (by me) performance with the early British jazz-rock fusion band Upp.  Another mesmerizing performance by Beck, but the rest of the band seemed mediocre in comparison.  Maybe that's why the band didn't take off.

My biggest negative is that the image quality of the Yardbirds material should have been better; I've seen these performances on other releases looking and sounding much better than here. Also, the final performance with Upp seemed to have been taped off a television broadcast, as there is a blocked out section of the image where the station's call letters had been.

This is well worth having if you're a Jeff Beck fan, but in my opinion, is not worth paying the price I did here; if you can find it for maybe five bucks, it's a good deal.  Anything more, and it becomes less so.  You want your money's worth of Jeff Beck?  Get 'Live at Ronnie Scotts' instead.",1394928000,5,1692,4.574750830564784
8627425,5,B00GTSVP2O,"Being a huge Jeff Beck fan, I was really surprised when I saw exactly what was on this new The Jeff Beck Years 60's-70's dvd. Laser Media must have spent some time finding these fantastic performances of The Jeff Beck Group from about 1972-1973. The quality of the films they found for this dvd are average to above average, with the exception of the Shindig's I'm A Man featuring Jeff Beck with the Yardbirds, which is poor- but all the Shindig films I own are all very poor quality- so this is not an issue.

The dvd begins with 4 performances of Jeff Beck with the Yardbirds- all in black and white. The performances are I'm A Man, For Your Love, Heart Full Of Soul and Train Kept A Rollin. There are no references anywhere on the dvd where these performances were taken from, other than the I'm A Man from Shindig. These Yardbird performances are always great, but not rare. After these first 4 black and white Yardbird performances comes the rarest performances I have yet to see of Jeff Beck. The Jeff Beck Group perform 4 songs from about 1972 or 1973- Goin Down, Situation, Got The Feeling and Definitely Maybe. (This is the second Jeff Beck Group- not the first when Jeff Beck started with Rod Stewart, Ron Wood and Mick Waller).

To say these Jeff Beck Group performances are beyond tremendous and rare is a huge understatement! The video is just above average, but great to see in color and the sound is above average, but it's just so fantastic to hear them in these 4 live performances! You will see the talented Jeff Beck on his guitar, Bob Tench on vocals, Max Middleton on the piano, Clive Chaman on bass and Cozy Powell on drums. Jeff Beck's guitar work is truly magical especially on the song he wrote- Definitely Maybe.

In addition to the Yardbird's and Jeff Beck Group performances are two additional rare performances I have not seen before on dvd. Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton play together doing Further On Up The Road. This is just tremendous! For the last performance, we get to see another rarity of Jeff Beck playing with Upp. They play Down In The Dirt from 1974. Back in 1974, Jeff Beck produced and played guitar on the debut album for Upp- who were a British jazz/rock band. When you see this Upp performance, take notice of the guitar Jeff Beck is playing. This rare 1954 oxblood finish Les Paul guitar is one of Rock's touchstone guitars, which Jeff Beck bought in Memphis after the original buyer had it modified, then decided not to buy it. The sound is simply beautiful beyond words.

This 5 Star dvd features Jeff Beck in his youth in the rarest performances I have never seen of The Jeff Beck Group and is well worth buying for any Jeff Beck fan! Here Are The Complete Songs on the dvd:
01.) I'm A Man (Yardbirds)
02.) For Your Love (Yardbirds)
03.) Heart Full Of Soul (Yardbirds)
04.) Train Kept A Rollin (Yardbirds)
05.) Goin Down (Jeff Beck Group)
06.) Situation (Jeff Beck Group)
07.) Got The Feeling (Jeff Beck Group)
08.) Definitely Maybe (Jeff Beck Group)
09.) Further On Up The Road (Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton)
10.) Down In The Dirt (Jeff Beck and Upp)",1392249600,20,3098,4.516934046345811
