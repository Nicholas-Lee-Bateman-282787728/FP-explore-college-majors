8377758,5,B000UE1KV4,Good trash movie if you wanna see Marta in a role other than LIS.  One nude butt shot for 3 seconds makes this worth the 90 bucks I paid for the DVD.,1515974400,,149,3.65625
8377759,4,B000UE1KV4,"The plot involves Julie (Marta Kristen), who is an actress heading to Hollywood. While getting settled she stays with her friend from her hometown. Julie's friend Jessica (Kathy Kersh), isn't exactly living the straight life. Julie finds out that Jessica is an uptown hooker. This doesn't seem to bother Julie, and she begins looking for work in Hollywood. When she finds out that there are no parts for her; she is crushed. The people looking to use her, and her failure to find acting roles causes Julie to break down crying. Jessica moves to comfort her, thus causing a fantastic lesbian sequence. This is very interesting given Marta's innocent tv role on (Lost In Space).

I have bought this film from a few places, and have yet to get a good quality picture. I imagine that it was only released once on vhs. It would be nice if someone would find a good print and have it digitally remastered.",1291593600,6,899,4.654088050314465
