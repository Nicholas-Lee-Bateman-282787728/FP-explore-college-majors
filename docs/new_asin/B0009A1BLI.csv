8058565,5,B0009A1BLI,"I thought the baby portion was wonderful, especially as an introduction to baby yoga for baby and mama. The toddler portion felt like the baby portion but when the kids are bigger. Both my boys as babies and toddlers loved it... it was an activity we did together (especially when I had a baby and a toddler at the same time)... and it gave me some security as to how flexible our babies are. Enjoy!",1453248000,2,399,4.333333333333333
8058566,1,B0009A1BLI,The quality is AWFUL! It looks like someone just decided to rent terrible equipment and shoot in their livingroom with no script or real format. Looks like an old 80's BBC video.,1416096000,,178,4.59375
8058567,1,B0009A1BLI,"I thought this would be perfect for my toddler and newborn, but there is so much filler from the instructors prattling on about nothing. It is shot poorly, looks super homemade, and feels jumpy as well. The toddler section has very few poses; in fact, it feels like you are watching some kids roll around on the floor. Boring, short, and completely useless. You could make something up on your own and it would be better. Perhaps that is what they are going for, but even as an instructional video for parents about how to make up your own routine, it is lacking and gives little guidance behind the actual art of yoga sessions with kids.",1233619200,7,638,4.508620689655173
8058568,1,B0009A1BLI,I agree with the above reviewer about the toddler part. The whole DVD is just  horrible. I took a baby and me yoga class and I thought that we could have just recorded one of those classes and it still would have been ten times better than this DVD. DON'T waste your money.,1166140800,9,273,4.150943396226415
8058569,5,B0009A1BLI,"I rented this from Netflix and like it so well I bought a copy to keep for the long term.  As an adult with a regular yoga practice I was looking for something I could do with my baby so that she gets the best possible start in life and this is terrific!

The instruction for infants is great, progressing as your baby grows and changes while building confidence, trust, and supporting the strong bond between you and your baby.  It teaches you to handle your baby safely while you engage them, and shows you ways to broaden your baby's perspective of the world through all of their senses.

I haven't watched much of the toddler part yet since my baby isn't even a year old, but I look forward to sharing it with her and encouraging her to develop her awareness of her body as she grows.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1158278400,10,818,4.3202614379084965
8058570,5,B0009A1BLI,"From the moment the instructor began speaking on this DVD (which I borrowed from the library), it had my baby's rapt attention.  He squealed with joy just at the sound of her voice.

We did the age appropriate exercises with our baby and he couldn't stop laughing and smiling (even though he's grouchy about teething these days).

He loved it, and I came online to buy a copy because it made him so happy.  Maybe the toddler modules aren't as good (though it would be surprising after the high quality of the baby modules), but the baby modules get an intense and happy reaction.

Try it at your local library if you want to preview it before buying.  Our baby loves it.",1143676800,15,670,4.450819672131147
8058571,1,B0009A1BLI,"the first half is toddler / second half baby.

toddler section 3 parts:

stretching - the kids stretch almost motionless for a couple minutes while the brit hostess chats about nothing.  then each of the 5 or 6 kids takes a turn blowing a bubble from the bubble wand the hostess is holding.  i'm not kidding.  they are sort of told to reach for the bubbles.  a couple of the kids slightly wave at them.

relaxing - the kids are motionless falling asleep and hostess rubs the temples of a couple of them.  i'm really not kidding

poses - an ugly lady tells you that poses are being shown and they are flashed very rapidly on the screen.  then kids (one kid actually) does each pose - for less than five seconds each.  i think after the 3rd pose of maybe 10, the poses get even more brief.  you certainly don't even have time to see the pose and react and its done.

we stopped there.  our 3 year old who is a very bright and cooperative kid was drawing at the table and ignoring the pitiful dvd.",1136851200,70,994,4.218085106382978
