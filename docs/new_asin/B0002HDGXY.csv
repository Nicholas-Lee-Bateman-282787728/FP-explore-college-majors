2098467,5,B0002HDGXY,"Any DVD by David Leadbetter will help any golfer with there game. This DVD will help with putting, sand bunker, and pitching.",1390694400,,125,4.7272727272727275
2098468,5,B0002HDGXY,"The short game needs lots of practice, we all know that. But you need to be able to understand what to practice. This short game DVD will give you the tools you'll need to practice correctly. Get started today.",1381276800,2,210,4.410256410256411
2098469,5,B0002HDGXY,"I started playing golf regularly last year and took lessons throughout the summer but even after all the lessons I still continued to three or four putt and regularly miss 3 footers.  While not a miracle cure Leadbetter broke everything down into very simple concepts.  After two weeks of practicing these concepts I played twice this week and drained several putts over 20 feet and never three putted.

I am not saying there aren't some cheesy 80's and 90's clothing choices like some of the other reviewers mention but if you can get past the appearance there is nothing dated about techniques that have helped me take 5-7 stokes off a round.  I know I spent most of this review talking about the putting but it also helped my understanding of chipping and pitching properly.

I cannot recommend it enough if you are a newer golfer or struggling with your short game.",1373068800,2,869,4.690789473684211

2098472,5,B0002HDGXY,"Leadbetter's explanations are lucid and sensible.  He explains as well as demonstrates how to pitch, chip, and putt.  This program will save you money on golf lessons.",1356307200,,167,5.148148148148148
2098473,5,B0002HDGXY,"I chose the video because the Pro in my club recommend it and it was a great surprise, this is the one vido that will help me and my wife improve our game and our fun.

Highly recommend and with a comprehensive language.",1354233600,,220,4.116279069767442
2098474,4,B0002HDGXY,"The instruction by Leadbetter is good.  It goes over the basics of the short game step by step.  This is a good beginner's DVD, though.  One negative part for me was the beginner with Leadbetter throughout the video.  I just found that he was a distraction.  Leadbetter would show a technique then the beginner would do it.  Ok..I get it.  We get to see him instruct someone.  I would just rather have Leadbetter show it, then do it.  Then, let us move on to the next technique.  Watching this beginner do it just dragged things out too much for me.",1300060800,4,549,4.4
2098475,5,B0002HDGXY,"I found this video to be quite helpful for my golf game, filled with great information. I play the video when I need to review after a round of golf. Great video.",1295136000,,162,4.09375
2098476,3,B0002HDGXY,"Note the date in the title (i.e. 1991). I didn't see that and bought the DVD thinking it was a new release with updated concepts. It turned out to be an old VHS tape (that I bought 10 years ago) simply put onto DVD with some new cover packaging. The ability to go to specific chapters is a nice feature of DVD, but you can probably buy the old VHS (Short Game) for a lot less.",1154736000,15,376,3.960526315789474
