5152190,4,B008CMF0P8,"In the film a psychologist and paranormal investigator, played by Sigourney Weaver, and her physicist assistant, played by Cillian Murphy, investigate a famous psychic.
This movie attacks the tired old idea of 'is ESP real? With those who need to believe as opposed to those that see naivety at best, or a down right con at worst' with new dynamism, new concepts and explanations. Not a single shot of the movie is redundant or a 'filler' shot. There are none of the 'excessive scary movie' theatrics to keep you on edge of your seat.
It has the right narrative, with what I believe to be the right actors and the right scenes to take you where it wants to take you. There is misdirection and the odd McGuffin peppered here, and there has some clever twists in the tale.
This is a 'clever' movie, doesn't spell out everything for you, and makes you want to watch it carefully so as to not miss a thing. I had not heard much about this before it came out, and I was enticed by the actor set-up, as I had recently been watching lots of Cillian Murphy films. So I decided based on this to go see this film, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised if you liked, and hate to sound clichd here, the film inception - with the whole playing with your mind thing, then you will like this movie, for me it is a thriller worthy of at least 4 stars.
I have seen and read a number of very negative reviews where people didn't get or felt cheated, I do not wish to sound sarcastic, but I'm not sure they watching the same movie as I was.
For more of a plot over view please see Ms R Hoseason's review, that describes it very well.
All in all great story, which really kept me in captivated, I will be checking out the DVD when it is out, and look forward to the extras. If the film is still out release then I would recommend seeing on the big screen",1344470400,61,1838,4.224431818181818

5152213,4,B008CMF0P8,"Professor Margaret Matheson (Sigourney Weaver) and he assistant Tom Buckley (Cillian Murphy) have a very unique and interesting job. They travel the country trying to prove of disprove psychics, magician, paranormal researchers, and people in similar fields. They would like nothing more than to find the real thing, but so far, Matheson has only found one person she hasn't been able to prove is a fraud, and that's Simon Silver (Robert De Niro). She is terrified of the man, but he assistant doesn't know any better and wants to make a name for himself by going after the legendary medium. I am in utter disbelief that a film with a cast like this was direct-to-film, but all that aside, it's as good a story as you'll find on the big screen. What can you say about De Niro and Weaver that hasn't been said a million times before, but this film is almost like a passing of the torch, as Murphy got the majority of the air time. How'd he do, Cillian Murphy absolutely stole the show right out from under them, in what is easily his best performance to date. To be honest, this is one of those films I watched for the cast, I wasn't super interested in the story and at times it was painfully slow, but Red Lights has some downright creepy moments, and the ending will absolutely blow your mind. If you're the patient type who enjoys a great performance, this films for you, if not, you might want to skip this one, as it takes a while to get going, and gives you some things you really have to think about afterwards.",1470009600,,1518,4.4640287769784175

5152216,5,B008CMF0P8,"It says a  lot about a young actor's talent when he gets the main credit SUPPORTED by Sigourney Weaver and Robert DeNiro. This is a fast-paced, fascinating and highly entertaining film. I am interested in debunking the paranormal, so that was fascinating to me. And, the twist genuinely surprised me---which twists rarely do these days. Criminally underrated Irish actor Cillian Murphy always manages to raise the level of every picture he's in, and this one is no exception. With his piercing intelligence and ethereal beauty, he showed a powerful range and energy, which made De Niro look one-note and like he was phoning it in (which he probably was).  Sigourney, Toby Jones and Elizabeth Olsen have good supporting roles. But really, this is Cillian's movie.

5152221,3,B008CMF0P8,"I didn't like this film visually, but there were moments I liked--especially the explanation of ""psychic"" tricks and some of the interactions Weaver's researcher character has with Murphy and others. Unfortunately, I thought De Niro kind of was just not up to our expectations of him. I simply did not like him in this part.

The story is basically about investigating hauntings and psychics and showing the REAL stuff that makes it happen (it opens with a haunting that is more about some family members wanting out of the house than a ghost's interference). We see what drives the characters both to want to disbelieve and want to believer.

The climactic moment, while twisty, I found  underwhelming. It just did not have the power I wanted or expected. I was let down.

But I can see where this could have been really great. It just didn't make it.

Still, for Cillian and Weaver, worth watching. And to make us think a bit.",1447286400,,928,4.703703703703703

What were the critics panning in this movie? Was it supposed to be Alien and Raging Bull Meet Scarecrow? The bad reviews confound me. This little indie is a gem! Weaver, De Niro, Cortes -- we should have known this would be no bad movie. It's a terrific sleeper.
My suggestion: go with it in the first viewing. Then watch it again. Like Inception and Matruska dolls, Red Lights will delight you over and over again!",1436572800,5,586,4.435185185185185
5152231,5,B008CMF0P8,"This is a movie that starts slowly and builds its suspense.  Starts with slices of the lives of two Phd's (Weaver + Murphy), who investigate and debunk supernatural claims/events.  They daily work as an underfunded college professor and her assistant.  After living in seclusion for 30 years, a Simon Silver returns to tour the U.S.  The young Buckley wants to investigate him, he feels he is being taunted by Silver.  Dr. Matheson who had been goaded by Silver 30 years ago and came away the worse for it tells him to let it go.  But youth being what it is he can't leave it.  As Silver powers seem unlimited and he passes all tests, the pace of the movie and the spooky factor climb.

Sigourney Weaver and her aide are with a university, and debunk mediums and fortune tellers.  This story is about Robert De Niro's character, a blind medium, and whether he is or is not the real thing.  It is, of course, much more complicated than that simple description, and you will be confused and enthralled and plain curious to find out what the heck is actually going on here.

5152237,5,B008CMF0P8,"Thankfully I didn't read any reviews before I watched this film. I recalled seeing the preview a couple of years ago, and I thought, you can't go wrong with Weaver, Murphy & DeNiro. I waited for it to come out, however it never screened in the town I lived in (I just found out there was a limited release). I stumbled upon it a few nights ago via Amazon, not knowing what was in store for me. Let's just say I wished I wouldn't have watched this on a work night because I couldn't get to sleep for a couple of hours after watching it. It was that good.

With that said, I went on to read a few initial reviews via Rotten Tomatoes, and I was in shock at the terrible ratings it received. I thought ""What universe are these people on?"" And as a previous reviewer stated, what movie were they watching because it couldn't have been the same movie I saw, and I'm pretty particular about films, not easily swayed.  The acting was powerful with DeNiro & Weaver, obviously, however Cillian Murphy is slowly paving his own place as a very powerful actor who throws himself so mercilessly into any character he plays (check out The Wind that Shakes the Barley).  This is definitely a thriller that you have to pay attention to right out of the gate, because you will miss clues, and yes, you'll probably need to watch it a second time.

I feel the film is timely due to the rise and popularity of psychics in the world. If you're looking for a ""surface Hollywood formula"" film, then you won't like it. The narrative of this story lets you know nothing is as it seems, people or events. One's account of an event is completely different than someone else who witnessed the same event. I like films that aren't linear, though that can make a movie-goer uncomfortable as we've gotten used to being let in on every single thing as a film progresses. Parting words: if you have heart medicine, take it before you watch this film. I don't know where the negative reviews are coming from. This is one that slipped under the radar. No gimmicks or tricks.",1429315200,,2038,4.426666666666667

5152239,2,B008CMF0P8,"This is a movie as other have said that keeps you watching to try to figure out what is going on.  It is rather too opaque to be appealing, but eventually it becomes evident that Sigourny Weaver's character is obsessed with the idea of proving all forms of paranormal activity are phony.  Even when she confronts someone whom she cannot prove is a phony, she simply avoids the subject.  She dies half way through the leaden movie, possibly as a result of the antipathy and supernatural power from the man she has been unable to prove a fraud.  But we really don't know this.  Her companion in her obsessive quest to prove all psychic and paranormal activity is a fraud continues to do her work, including going against the man she was afraid to encounter.  The ending is a surprise to most people, so I won't divulge it here.

5152262,1,B008CMF0P8,"Oof, its been a while since Ive seen a film this bad.  I mean this one had more flaws than you could shake a stick at.  You know you're in trouble from the very beginning when Tom (Cillian Murphy) wakes Dr. Matheson (Sigourney Weaver) just to tell her to get some sleep.  Even if you can rationalize that moment, there are more soon after that reinforce the fact that you're going to ask for these two hours of your life back later on.  Why would such established actors (Weaver and DeNiro) tie themselves to such a turd?

Unfortunately, with the exception of the first Twilight book, I have this annoying habit where I have to finish whatever it is I start, so I actually sat through the entirety of this movie, which was nothing more than an insult to true skeptics everywhere from beginning to end.  I should warn you that there are spoilers in this review, but it doesnt really matter, because you should probably avoid seeing this film.

At one point near the beginning of the film, Simon Silver (DeNiro) steps off of a plane, takes his sunglasses off to show the audience that hes blind, then puts them back on again.  Thats it.  Thats the only purpose in removing the glasses.  Theres no one else around, and what else would he be doing - looking around?  As a supposed (but you're not supposed to know that yet) blind man?  Ugh.

Murphy, an actor whose work I often enjoy, goes off the rails with the acting here.  In one scene, hes watching Matheson debate skepticism on television, and hes chewing the scenery so bad, he was probably picking set splinters out of his teeth for weeks.  Then, later on, with unexplained intensity, he insists on investigating that sinister Silver.  :Shakes fist:  Whats with all the hostility, bro?

And Matheson, who is assumed to know her stuff, not only is shaken to core by Silver, something I still don't understand, but also keeps her son on life support, despite her beliefs that there is nothing waiting for him on the other side.  That doesnt sound like a true skeptic to me.

I think I realized about halfway through the first act that Silver wasn't really blind, if it even took me that long, and the evidence was everywhere.  For one thing, a blind man should have been clenching his ears and begging for relief while standing in a room of raised frequencies - hello, trumped-up sense of hearing!  And then when his secret is finally revealed at the end, its more of a throwaway line after a half-hearted attempt at setting up a climax.  It seemed like even the filmmakers couldn't wait to wrap it up and go home.

As far as plots go, this one was a bunch of different elements being thrown together in a blender with no rhyme, reason, or explanation, and without a happy accident.  Dr. Matheson dies out of nowhere, and from what were never really sure, though, it must have something to do with that sinister Silver, right?  :Shakes fist:  Toms apartment gets ransacked behind Sally (Elizabeth Olsen), yet she never hears a thing.

There are such random occurrences as dead birds being hurled at glass windows with amazing precision and enough explosions to make Michael Bay jealous that no one ever questions.  And the fight scene is an over-the-top joke from which no one mortal would simply get up and walk away.  To top it all off, you get a tie-it-all-up answer in an ending that essentially craps on the entirety of the film by making one of the main characters into the very thing that the two of them were trying to disprove the entire time.

5152287,3,B008CMF0P8,"Was I supposed to discern within myself, and go back and forth throughout the entire film to find the truth?  It was an awkward and odd direction/plot(debunking paranormal activities), and to my surprise the Director lured big names to play the characters.

 Weaver's character was boring.  Perhaps that was the intention of the Director?  She was dry, bland, and non-insightful for a lack of a better word.  Cillian Murphy delivered with his performance, yet I wasn't understanding what his character was ultimately attempting to accomplish...the catalyst for his shenanigans were due largely in part because his mother was delayed from seeking critical medical treatment due to advice from a fraud psychic.  I think if anything....he needs a psychologist.  Lastly, Deniro's character. I will admit I was convinced up until the revelation by the students of the telepathy synchronization - that Deniro did in fact possess psychic abilities.  HOWEVER, even after the end sorted itself out with the long drawn out dramatic random fight scene in the bathroom of the theater, and Cillian Murphy approaching Deniro at center-stage, I didn't feel any sense of physic wisdom flowing through my mind and body.  It was yet another awkward character role for Deniro.

5152289,4,B008CMF0P8,"This was a difficult film for me to get into. I found the first third a little boring, the second third much more interesting and the final third unbelievable and disappointing.

Sigourney Weaver plays, Margaret Matheson, a professor of Science who exposes psychic frauds. With her experience she is able to meet these psychics and debunk them with one meeting. All except one psychic, Simon Silver played by Robert DeNiro. Her younger colleague, Tim Buckley, played by the magnetic Cilian Murphy is an admirer if her intellect and her authority. Margaret has had one devastating experience with Silver, and she will not meet with him again. Buckley is adamant that they must meet, he must debunk Silver's claims. The rest of the film is spent looking atSilver and trying to discover his weakness.

What I could never really ne'er stand was what greatness Silver had. There was not enough of his appearances and the investigation into his claims. Murphy, as magnificent as his performance is, was not able to convince me of his abilities. The acting was superb, but too understated for this kind of film. DeNiro seemed to be a strange actor for this film, although he did hold his own. Weaver and Murphy gave powerful performances, and they were the ones who interested me the most.

This is a film that could have been great, except for the missing ingredient, whatever it was. I will, however, look askance at all psychics from this time on.

5152290,4,B008CMF0P8,"This is an interesting movie about psychic senses.  There are lots of psychics out there.  How do you tell the real ones from the phonies?  A good magician can easily trick you.  Some are really big showmen, too.  Is there anyone out there who is not a phony?  If so, would you know them when you saw them?

Margaret and Tom are a research team with a small budget.  She teaches college classes.  He handles the technological equipment when they go on the road to check out a reported paranormal incident.  The movie begins with them driving to Vermont to check out incidents in a house.  Margaret is a skeptic.  Meanwhile, Simon Silver ""the most celebrated psychic of all time"" decides to come out of a 30-year retirement and begin public appearances again.

Again, this is an interesting movie with an interesting ending.  The movie touches on sceances, the spirit world, spoon bending, mindreading, moving objects, etc.  Good performances.  Interesting subject.",1374364800,,1136,5.016129032258065
5152301,4,B008CMF0P8,"Red Lights is one of those films that I really wanted to see at last year's Sundance film festival. Unfortunately, it was impossible to get into. I'm sure that had something to do with the cast: Sigourney Weaver, Al Pacino, Cillian Murphy, Joely Richardson and Toby Jones. With names like that, that premiere was the hottest ticket in Park City.

Oddly surprising, though, is that after Sundance, Red Lights really didn't get a very good run. I'm fairly certain it never played anywhere near me and if it did, it did not last long. And that's a shame because it turned out to be one of the best thrillers I've seen in some time.

Red Lights is about a team of professional paranormal skeptics, Margaret Matheson (Weaver) and Tom Buckley (Murphy). This team attend various paranormal events and places and debunk the supernatural in the name of science. On the other side of the fence is Paul Shackleton (Jones) who is trying to prove that things like ESP actually exist, but also in the name of science.

Enter Simon Silver (Pacino). Silver is the godfather of all psychics, the one ""gifted person"" that the skeptics have been unable to disprove. And he's coming out of retirement to make millions of dollars on folks who believe in him. Certainly, odd events occur around him that would make it seem so and even the skeptics begin to have moments of doubt that Silver could, in fact, be the miracle they have never seen.

What makes Red Lights so good is the constant toying of its audience's mind. Silver is utterly convincing and just when you think you have caught him faking something, he comes in and does something that utterly astounds. There are so many twists in this film (including a major mind-blowing one at the end), that you never truly know which end is up. All you can do is strap yourself in and brace yourself for the ride on the tilt-a-whirl.

Obviously, a great cast is what makes everything so believable in Red Lights. With Pacino as Silver (appropriately named for his silver tongue), the charisma of that character makes you want to believe in the impossible things he claims to do. Weaver as the ultimate skeptic, Matheson, is almost sad in her devotion with a never-ending dedication to bringing people's hopes in the supernatural crashing down around their ears. But it's Murphy who steals the show as Buckley, the man who goes after Silver with a vengeance - because once you realize why he is so obsessed with Silver, you'll be a freaked out and completely shocked.",1372809600,,2496,4.689497716894977

5152308,2,B008CMF0P8,"Sigourney Weaver who is a great actress was wasted in this trip through- the- land of the supernatural. I mean she was great with what she had to work with but the story just couldn't grip me. I kept waiting for something really powerful to happen only to be lead around the corner into another elongated moment. The film is about a supposedly famous psychic named Silver who has come out of ""retirement"" while some paranormal debunkers (Weaver, Murphy) are bored with the typical charlatans of our day. Deniro is off the mark as Silver and seems to be looking to generate a wow moment but never finds it. A very contrived acting turnout from one of the greats.

Cillian Murphy (Weavers ""sidekick"") becomes the attempted carrier of the film as does what he can to keep the viewer hooked. There is actually some great material here that just can't translate properly to full entertainment, at least the way this film handled it. This was another case of wanting to like a film but having to come to terms with the reality that it just wasn't done well. I will however probably remember the movie compared to so many other easily forgotten movies because a liked the subject matter.

This is a movie about aimed at the many so called Psychics,mediums,and people with telekinetic powers. Ripley and Dr. Crane are paranormal debunkers. Their job is to find out if the ghosts,psychics,mediums,and people with telekinetic powers are real or not. They are able to debunk most of their findings until they meet Silver, aka Robert DeNiro. His abilities have been untested and so far he seems to be the legit thing for the first time. Both Ripley and the Scarecrow are cannot seem to figure out how to bring his false powers into the light...

****Spoilers here**** What you end up watching this movie is learning the story about a young man that has true telekinetic powers and he works with a skeptic doing investigations in  secret hopes that he may find he is not the only one like him. His true ability of being telekinetic allows him to realize when he is in the midst of a fraud. Unfortunately Tom never gets to show Margaret the truth. That he is a psychic powers are real and he has them. We don't find out until the end of the movie about his powers but the film makes it seems as if Silver is the one casting these strange occurrences on Tom. The truth is that Tom doesn't know the extinct of his own powers or how to control them. As he becomes less stable after Margaret's death his powers start going off on their own causes strange events to occur around him.

While it has a few prominent hazy spots and short-cuts, RED LIGHTS is a thought-provoking exploration of ""psychics,"" parapsychology, and the otherworldly in general given via a taut and compelling storyline.

5152320,3,B008CMF0P8,"Red Lights follows Margaret Matheson (Sigourney Weaver), a college professor, and Tom Buckley (Cillian Murphy), a physicist, as they debunk supernatural phenomena. Eventually, the extremely popular and potentially real psychic, Simon Silver (Robert De Niro) remerges sending fear and suspicion into the duo. Red Lights is a great mystery thriller until it loses its focus and ditches the great aspects of the first half.

Red Lights story was interesting, especially the first half. It explains the several ways ""psychics"" can fake their powers; for example, causing a table to move or levitate by pressing down on it at certain points which is demonstrated by Tom. I thought this concepts was intriguing and promoted open thinking. However, it eventually ditches the tone/atmosphere during the second half and begins to fumble; it begins to throw random and ineffective jump-scares, action that lacks tension or suspense, and an ending that is predictable and unfulfilling. Also, some of the dialogue wasn't really engaging and was lacking ""flow"" (for lack of a better word), some of it felt unnatural. Great acting, most of the time, and great music.

Overall, Red Lights had great potential and an excellent first half, but lacks the proper execution, ditches a great concept, and loses direction during the second half. As of 3/28/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, I recommend a rental for fans of the genre.

5152332,2,B008CMF0P8,"Sometimes a movie has such a compelling concept and cast that I will make a point of seeing it, even if the reviews are mixed at best.  Sometimes, that ends up being worthwhile.  And sometimes, the reviews were right and a great cast and engaging concept were not enough to exceed the other shortcomings.

RED LIGHTS falls, sadly, into the latter category.  A terrific cast of both ""grand"" names (Sigourney Weaver, Robert DeNiro) and some younger actors who've done great work (Cillian Murphy, Elizabeth Olsen).  An interesting concept...a couple of professors (Weaver & Murphy) who go around debunking paranormal activity come up against the most famous psychic in the world (DeNiro).  Sounds like fun.

Well, the idea is good.  The plot does take some interesting turns.  But the dialogue and character development is pretty pitiful, and the editing is quite poor.  The movie leaps around in tone for no reason.  Overall, it wants to be serious (as befits these ""great"" actors), but then there are moments of silly playfulness that practically remind me of the TV show ""Supernatural"" and the light banter between the two brothers.  Characters are not fleshed out...such as when Murphy's 30-something professor invites a young student to lunch (Olsen) and the next thing you know, they appear to be practically living together, even though we barely sense a spark between them.  DeNiro is in relatively little of the film, and there's one completely perplexing scene where he interacts one-on-one with Murphy in which the dialogue makes him sound like a lightweight & laughable version of Brando's character in APOCALYPSE NOW.  He spouts ""lofty"" sounding pseudo-philosophy that makes no sense...in fact, it goes beyond that to uncomfortably laughable.

Writer Rodrigo Cortes is not helped in his efforts by the director Rodrigo Cortes.  The script is flawed, and the direction seems to play into those flaws, rather than minimizing them.  It makes me believe that Cortes really feels he is making a grand statement about belief and our need to believe in something beyond the ""ordinary"" world.  (There are some scenes with Weaver and her comatose son that are mildly touching, because Weaver is such a good actress.)  But what he's really got here is an extended Twilight Zone episode that needs a bit more building tension and a sense of dread...and easily 15 minutes less running time.

I'm curious to know how this excellent cast was assembled for a movie that is so problematic.  Perhaps the original script was better and during filming, was weakened.  Perhaps they are all cousins of the director and did it as a favor.  I just don't know.  At least none of them have irreparably tarnished their reputations.  Weaver comes out best, and while in many ways Murphy's character is the silliest, he's a very interesting actor.  Olsen is nearly a non-entity, but she doesn't do anything to embarrass herself.  DeNiro gives one of his ""paycheck"" performances that he's done so much of lately (which makes his truly committed work in a film like SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK so much more important).

Trust me...even if you're a big fan of this cast...don't spend 113 minutes of your life on it.",1363910400,3,3190,5.001897533206831

5152337,3,B008CMF0P8,"Rodrigo Cortes' Red Lights starts off as a smart thriller taking place in the world of paranormal debunkers that ends up betraying it's own intelligent ambitions for unconvincing Shamalanian twists. There will be two kinds of audiences for this movie, one looking for the first part and the other who longs for this type of ludicrous ""surprise"" ending. I am sure neither will be satisfied.
 Sigourney Weaver is once again well cast a strong female authority figure, as Dr. Margaret Matheson she and Cillian Murphy play a pair of psychic investigators, but instead of ghost hunters international they are specialists in debunking the apparently supernatural. In thirty years time Dr. Matheson has never come across a case she couldn't crack with one exception, a blind psychic named Simon Silver (Robert De Niro). As it would happen Silver has come out of retirement to an adoring and willing public, while Margaret wants nothing to do with him, her young protge Tom Buckley (Murphy) can't wait to get an opportunity to try and crack this nut.
 An intriguing concept given that in this day and age when so many people buy into ""reality"" TV shows and other media perpetrating the belief in ghosts, psychics,  healers, dog whispers and other such things. It may not seem like such a serious problem, but indeed they are cons who at best just swindle innocent people out of money and at worst can lead others into harm. I personally have very little patience for this kinds of despicable swindlers. A magician named James Randi has made a life and career out of exposing these frauds and if you don't know who he is, it might be interesting for you look him up on the internet.
  The cast is heavy in a good way, with De Niro the star attraction as Simon Silver, a sort of a cross between Uri Geller and John Edward. De Niro is able to show off his natural charisma and great showmanship in one of his better recent roles. The first half hour of the movie moves at a rather sluggish pace, largely because we anticipate De Niro, both the actor and his character. However, it is easy to get caught up in the story and eventually ignore the fact that Simon Silver really is a background character in this story.
  Spanish writer-director Cortes made an impressive English language debut two years ago with the striking Ryan Reynolds thriller Buried. He demonstrated a keen interest in sophist acted scares and nail biting suspense with that movie. It's claustrophobic nature was nearly too much for me, I needed a long walk in the fresh air afterwards. It did it's job very effectively, then Cortes produced his script for the numbingly awful found footage fiasco Apartment 143, a movie that rest towards the top of the worst of 2012. Now with Red Lights, I still believe that Cortes has talent, but perhaps it's been somewhat over stated.
 A thriller about pseudo-science with only pseudo-scares. It all ends with a plot twist that seems at once  both obvious and ridicules. If Red Lights had taken it's subject matter a little more seriously and not resorted to parlor tricks of it's own, this could have been a very memorable movie.

5152347,2,B008CMF0P8,"The Buried director Rodrigo Corts writes and directs Red Lights, a Spanish-American thriller that deals with an intriguing theme: a polarized conflict between paranormal believers and scientific skeptics. Robert DeNiro plays Simon Silver, a celebrity mentalist coming back to the stage after a 30-years' hiatus. Cillian Murphy is Dr. Tom Buckley, an assistant to a paranormal debunker Dr. Margaret Matheson played by Sigourney Weaver.

In spite of Dr. Mathesons warning to stay away from him, Tom Buckley begins to investigate Simon Silver, and strange incidents start happening around the young doctor who gets obsessed with Silver. Does he really have paranormal abilities?

Part of the film is probably inspired by real-life scientific skeptic James Randi and his investigations of faith healers. It is obvious that Rodrigo Corts has made extensive researches in his attempt to make the thriller intelligent and cerebral.

With all respect to his effort, however, like many smart people he tends to forget one thing. Throughout the movie, Rodrigo Corts does not give us a convincing reason why these academics and students (including Elizabeth Olsens Sally wasted in an unnecessary romantic subplot) have to care whether or not Simon Silver is a fake.

Well, actually the director does give one at the climax where something extraordinary is revealed, but too late. After the carefully controlled narrative of the first two-thirds, the films final mind-blowing revelation only looks preposterous.",1361059200,,1499,5.476190476190476

5152370,3,B008CMF0P8,"The academic world has been largely dismissive of the paranormal, and in particular the so-called hard sciences has -- you're more likely to find folklorists investigating it than physicists.  That seems odd since phenomena that would have been considered quite miraculous 500 years ago have been easily investigated and understood by science today.  The bias against the paranormal seems born more of emotions than rationality, or perhaps, the practical rather than the impractical.  After all, the paranormal doesn't seem to conform to the tenets of conventional science, which would make it tough for conventional scientists to investigate it, which in turn would make it tough to get grants.  ""Red Lights"" starts out sensibly enough, pitting a skeptical psychologist, Matheson (Sigourney Weaver), against myriad charlatans, the most problematic of which seems to be a Uri Geller-like celebrity ESPer called Silver (Robert DeNiro).  The script stays within the bounds of reality right up until the part where her assistant, Buckley (Cillian Murphy), becomes obsessed with Silver, who he suspects may have had murderous intentions toward Matheson.  At this point, Buckley's histrionics change the tone of the film, and it launches into the sort of absurdity about the academic world that filmmakers never can resist -- Buckley, now the department head, threatening and physically assaulting a colleague (poor Toby Jones) in front of peers and students, for instance.  Yawn.  Scholars, even the crummy ones, work in an intellectual world, where the fireworks come from the interplay of thinking and not from violence, yet movies treat them as sophomoric jugheads.  You'll see the ending coming long before it gets unleashed, especially if you listen even casually to a line Buckley says early in the film.  Had what preceded the ending been better, it could have been satisfying.  But as things stand, ""Red Lights"" is too thin and can't decide if it wants to be a drama or a thriller, like an awkward short story with an otherwise interesting premise in an advanced creative writing class.  Director Rodrigo Cortes manages to give the film a reasonably professional if low-budget quality -- think Darren Aronovsky with a digital camera -- and with a better script than the one he fashioned, should be able to make a better film in the future.",1358380800,,2343,5.218666666666667

5152389,4,B008CMF0P8,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

SPOILERS

I don't really get the savage reviews this movie has its flaws but no more than most.  I found it too long and some of the internal logic did not work -- like how Matheson is so famous she is on the cover of a newspaper but can't get funding, Silver's rock star like popularity seems dubious.  And Buckley should not have been movie star handsome and getting all the girls, he should have been way more of an outcast.

But the trick this movie pulls is light years away from Shymalman/Twilight Zone. This movie tricked me into thinking I was watching one story, but it was really telling another.  A dead give away -- when the main character is killed off so early, I guess that wasn't the main character, I just thought it was.  What I love in this is how the characters keep saying ""here is how you are being tricked, what you are seeing is not what is happening, your measuremnts are wrong, you are overlooking the obvious"".  That is meant for us, the audience.

This is not a story about paramornal debunkers facing their greatest challenge.  The twist ending is not that Buckley is psychic.  The twist is this is a story about Buckley searching for his people, trying to find his place, to relieve his isolation.  That is why in the first debunk he is attracted to the hairdresser, why he is not surprised by all the weird events in his lab, why he is so passionate about Silver. I have a hunch Silver is his father, maybe a sub plot cut out.

I was wondering all along -- why is Buckley so crazy?  Why is he so obessive and excited and freaked out all the time?  Was it just a bad performance?  If he was just a researcher he does look crazy.  But his motivation to prove Silver (SPOILER AHEAD) legitmate is so deeply personal, he sees Silver as the only person he can relieve him of his isolation, loneliness.  That make his extreme and irrational behavior make sense.

I imagine it is like having a winning lottery ticket-- you want to eliminate any doubt that you are wrong, to fight the enormous excitement by reading the numbers 1 by 1 over and over, carefully, but you can't be careful because of the excitment.  That is the core of the last 1/3 of this movie.  Buckley thinks he has found his father, so to speak.  Rememeber his lies about his mother?  She died of cancer/she's a housewife.  Matthews asks  ""where did you come from?""  He's an orphan, he is the lost lonely soul described by Silver's assistant.  So he thinks Silver is the real deal but he has to be sure, that is why he is so freaked out.  And why he is so desperately disappointed at the end.",1357516800,,2637,4.424116424116424

5152422,1,B008CMF0P8,"You see the cast and think: Signourney, Bob DeNiro, that guy with the weird name and scary blue eyes who's in everything lately -- how bad could it be?

The answer: Bad. Veddy Bad. SPOILER ALERT. I'm about to reveal plot points, for those of you who don't believe me and decide to watch anyway.

First, lose all fantasies of watching Weaver and DeNiro duke it out on screen -- THEY NEVER MEET. Stupid, right? Weaver exits the film halfway through, probably because she came to her senses and realized that whatever they were paying her was not worth the hit on her reputation. DeNiro apparently doesn't care any more. Maybe he took a bath on NYC real estate and needs the money. Anyway, he plays a blind Uri Geller knockoff who comes out of retirement after 30 years, and Weaver is a paranormal researcher who is, you would think, keen to unmask him, but has some nasty history with him. A decent premise if the script were decent (it isn't) or the director knew what he was doing (he doesn't). And for the first 20 minutes or so you think, hey, maybe this will work. And then it gets really stupid. Apparently in this alternate universe, being a Famous Psychic is a Very Big Deal -- enough to capture the imagination of the public, fund university research programs, fuel talk shows, and occupy large sections of the 24/7 cable universe. And if you're caught being a fake? Then it's federal prison time for you.

Even if you can accept that premise, the movie just craps out. It turns out the DeNiro isn't really blind (shocking!). And that he wears a magic watch that somehow gives him all the answers (though that is never explained) and somehow allows him to levitate. And that Scary Blue Eyes is, well.... I won't ruin it for you further. If it were any sillier it might have been a comedy. But even there it fails.

She is a mentor for the brilliant if quirky Cillian Murphy who brings an idealistic reality to his role.  Up and coming Elizabeth Olsen and a sinewy Joely Richardson round out the cast along with character actor Toby Jones.

While I have very little interest in paranormal issues or things like ESP ability, I found this movie very interesting.  I think it had more to do with the unbelievably great acting that we have come to expect from the stars in this movie and not so much the script.

I do like the fact that the movie at the end does not come to a conclusion per se one way or the other as to whether these ""phenomena"" are real.  I think the movie's purpose itself was to show one view from the perspective of a group of people that actually do investigate these things for a living.

5152498,3,B008CMF0P8,"I am a big fan of Cillian Murphy and so decided to give this a punt. It is about some cutting edge paranormal psychic investigators, they are Sigourney Weaver (Dr. Margaret Matheson) and the afore mentioned Mr Murphy as her trusted side kick Tom Buckley. They work at a University where they are having their funding cut whilst fighting the good fight against fake mediums and psychics. Then the mysterious, enigmatic and blind television super psychic comes back into the limelight after a thirty year absence, this is Simon Silver. He had dropped off the radar after a mysterious death in his audience of one of his most out spoken critics. He is played by Robert De Niro, who as ever is good value for money.

Meanwhile things start to go wrong around Cillian, lights explode, computers go wrong and things just get smashed, so obviously it is Mr Silver warning him off from investigating his new show. Then things get nasty very quickly and an ultimate show down is all but inevitable. The `red lights' are a reference to things that are so out of place they act as warning signals, like helpers of the psychic going through the audience before hand to glean information that can be fed to the main man. This can be quite atmospheric and has real quality in the mood department and was entreating for the most part, however it does not keep up the good work.

So where does it go wrong, well there are loads of hints at things, like why does a blind man wear a watch etc. We are shown some of their pasts but essentially the characters are all pretty much formed and the love interest is more or less shoe horned in, but still kind of works. It is the ending where you realise that this is a just a film of plot holes and that is a bit insulting to the audience; I actually thought this was psycho, babble schmaltz at one point. Either way I was left feeling unfulfilled and for the simple reason that it was so badly written. The acting is all fine as you would expect, but seriously `Scooby Doo' would not get away with such a false ending. Whilst I am still a fan of the actors, I hope they never commit to anything from this production company again. To throw away a `good' film for the formulaic need for a plot twist is plain wrong, only see if you are a fan of the actors.",1353283200,,2283,4.382075471698113

I thought this might be a worthwhile dramatization of the kind of work that real-life debunkers such as Michael Shermer and Randi, the Magician, have done for decades.

The viewer does indeed get an under-the-table look at how some presumed psychics produce the effects that cause the gullible to grant them credence. However, after this promising beginning, ""Red Lights"" starts flinging itself all over the screen as if a demented poltergeist were at work.

The emotional exchanges are overwrought and out of all proportion to the topics under consideration. Special effects like blasts from a video game splatter at the viewer, where subtlety would have been much more effective and more realistic.

In addition, this film suffers from one of the worst editing jobs I've ever seen. It looks as if someone almost randomly cut scenes out of the action and distractedly spliced the remaining ends of the narrative together with scotch tape.

So too bad - a good beginning germ of an idea and a good concept for a surprise ending get buried here in poor execution.

It was interesting as well as building character. Dr. Tom Buckly invites a young student (Elizabeth Olsen) and romance interest into the investigating team.

As the film progresses a man named Simon Silver (Robert De Niro) a blind psychic...a Kreskin on steroids, comes out of a 30 year retirement to put on a show. Buckly wants to expose Silver, but Matheson does not. She had confronted Silver before and didn't come out at the winning end. Matheson believes he is a fraud, but at the same time knows he is clever enough to deceive her. She wants no part of it.

The story then centers around what turns out to be a weird confrontation between Buckly and Silver with an ending that I thought brought the movie down.

Good acting with character build up. A movie that goes at a good pace and holds your interest.

I had high hopes at the start - good production values, interesting first scenes, but from very early in the movie it was painfully easy to guess all the little ""gotcha"" moments, making Sigourney Weaver's character not so much brilliant as someone with merely average attentiveness capabilities. As we progress through the film, DeNiro's portrayal of cryptic sinisterness is decent, but nearly gives away the whole thing with one stupid line - which leads us to the first half of the big TWIST ending? The ONE question that surely would have been answered, proved or disproved some thirty years ago was evidently never even asked. The second half of the twist was predictable, but didn't have to be. The premise suggested by that little bit of last-minute-info could have made for an entirely different movie. I'd like to think DeNiro, Weaver, et al signed up expecting an entirely different caliber of film, but who's to say?

The thing that makes this thriller so great, is that unlike most of the movies made under the genera, the first half doesn't suffer to make the final half that much more shocking/amazing. This movie had me hooked from the start until the end without wasting a moment. Each scene was tense and did its job. The concept alone was enough to get me interested but they throw curve ball after curve ball to keep you that much more invested and it worked without fault. Nothing in the movie felt at all cheesy or forced. It had a very natural flow about it.

Now if you have heard anything about the movie you probably know that some people are loving the ending and others are hating the ending. I am without a doubt one of the people who love it.

Loosely translated, it does involve paranormal events but in a team whose careers are in debunking such, and not in the head spinning around spitting pea soup way. This movie makes you use your mind and demands your attention. Watch closely, pay attention, and try to figure it out. Yes, the ending took me by surprise but I like when that happens because too many movies are boringly predictable. As the credits began to roll and I thought about the ending, it hit me: ""Well of course!""

Tastes in films is relative. This movie will appeal to some but not all; it's the great thing about having different genres of movies, books, music, etc. If you want a movie that hands you all the drudging details on a silver platter and you can watch it mindlessly, no, this one isn't for you.",1349481600,,1165,4.469483568075117
5152566,3,B008CMF0P8,"This seems to be happening a lot these days. Use to be when I saw that Robert Deniro was in a film it was guaranteed to be a great movie. Unfortunately that's not the case anymore. The concept of the film was great but the writers or director dropped the ball on this. I hate to see a great concept not follow through on screen. Without giving away too much. The first scene looked like it was going to be fun but all of a sudden the investigators just leave without exposing anyone. Too bad a great scene turned dud. Robert Deniro's acting was great but they didn't give him much to work with. Again bad writing and directing. Siggy was stellar. But what happened to her is stupid. I'd like to go into details but don't want to ruin the movie for those who want to watch it. Mr. Deniro, you need to stop taking roles in inferior written scripts. You were known for only taking part in great scripts, There are several movies you have been doing that are tarnishing your reputation. Anyway, I'd wait until the price drops on this dvd if your planning to buy it. What a shame a really good idea. I could have made this movie 100x better. Oh they put a part in this movie involving a man brought out on stage in a stretcher. Very bad idea. The thing Deniro did to the patient was actually done by an indian mystic years ago and he was exposed as a fraud and they showed everyone how the scam went. So by Deniro doing this I immediatley recognized it as a trick.",1349395200,2,1459,4.232974910394265
5152567,5,B008CMF0P8,"I just got finished watching Red Lights.  Even though I won't go into details about the movie, I will say that it is worth watching.  As other reviewers stated, it has a surprise ending.  Just watch the movie carefully without any distractions.  I thought that the acting was good.  But then again, I must admit that I am not an acting coach!  You will be wondering throughout the movie if Robert DeNiro's character is really the real thing, or if Cillian Murphy's character will ever find proof of Silver's (DeNiro) trickery to satisfy his growing obsession with the truth.",1349395200,,574,4.747474747474747

5152569,3,B008CMF0P8,"Of course, the actors were great.  Unfortunately, I could only give the film three stars because I figured things out very early on.  However, I do not consider this a particular fault of the movie itself.  My last English-as-a-second language student was blind.  So, remembering that all magic is misdirection, the answer just came to my mind.  If you liked ""The Prestige"" and ""The Illusionist,"" you should give this movie a try.  It was worth the money, in my opinion.",1349308800,,470,4.8125
5152570,5,B008CMF0P8,"First of all it is important to note that I bought this movie from Best Buy the day it came out. Although I buy a lot of movies from Amazon, lately Best Buy and Walmart are offering some extra (exclusives) that Amazon doesn't have. For example this package (blu ray, DVD, digital copy) was $12.99 from Best Buy only. So make sure you do your homework each time a movie comes out.

The movie is just fantastic! Is the kind of movie that you must watch at least twice. Sigourney Weaver is outstanding playing a professor (Margaret Matheson) who tries to debunk all supernatural claims, against a ruthless De Niro who is Simon Silver a powerful blind psychic. Together with her assistant Tom (Cillian Murphy) they try to prove that De Niro is a charlatan. Murphy's contribution in the first half of the movie is small. However, he takes over the entire movie in the second part with an outstanding performance. Elizabeth Olson's role in the movie is minimal.

Throughout the entire movie I had the impression that I was missing something. Something was not connecting.  Just until the end when everything makes sense. Then I watched it again and I realized that I didn't paid attention to too many details the first time.  Then, there is De Niro's acting. I have never seen De Niro acting poorly. I have seen De Niro in bad movies (i.e. Machete), but I have never seen De Niro acting poorly. In this movie, where he plays the role of a blind totally ruthless psychic, the first thing that comes to mind is a comparison with the outstanding performance of Al Pacino playing a blind eccentric U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel (Frank Slade) in ""Scent of Woman"". Pacino was rewarded with the Oscar for his great performance and is totally justified. If we compare De Niro's performance in this movie with Al Pacino's performance in ""Scent of a Woman"", we come to the conclusion at first, that De Niro is a poor actor when playing a blind person. However, you need to watch the movie all the way to the end to understand how masterful, profound, and calculated De Niro's performance is in this movie. After I watched the movie I looked at the cover of the blu ray carefully and realized that the cover gives up half of the plot.

I am not going to describe more of the movie because I don't want to spoil it for you. You need to watch it and pay attention to the details all the way to the end and the really unexpected and surprising ending. Five stars because of the plot, the direction, and the outstanding performances of all actors. Great movie all around!",1349222400,12,2549,4.556768558951965

part for his age.  OLD.  Good thing he had supporting actors.  The

5152572,4,B008CMF0P8,"""What I'm saying is that after 30 years of investigating all kinds of phenomena with the right controls in place I have yet to witness a single miracle."" Paranormal researchers Dr. Margaret Matheson (Weaver) and Tom Buckley (Murphy) are the best at what they do. What they do is to go around and prove that psychic phenomena and the psychics that do them are frauds. When legendary psychic Simon Silver (De Niro) comes out of retirement and comes to the town that Matheson & Buckley live in Buckley wants his shot at him. Matheson is leery, and with good reason. I have said before that there are really only 3 ideas for movies that just keep getting remade over and over. This movie is an exception. The acting is obviously very good but the thing that I liked most about this movie is that I didn't predict the ending. Watching as many movies as I do it has become very easy to guess the endings. I did get one of the twists but the big one surprised me and I love when that happens. Other then that aspect the movie is actually very good and keeps you tense almost the entire time, with is hard to do in a movie about this subject. This is not really a fast paced movie but it is very good and tense and very much worth watching. I enjoyed it. Overall, great acting, great writing and an enjoyable movie to watch. I give it a B+.",1348963200,6,1332,4.2896825396825395
