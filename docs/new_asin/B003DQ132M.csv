8394872,2,B003DQ132M,"THE BEDEKEPER (L'APICULTEUR) has a straightforward plot involving the odyssey of a former schoolteacher Spyros (Marcello Mastrioanni), who embarks on a journey by lorry all over Greece and its islands to chase the honey. He ends up in his former home, now deserted, and frequents a now-deserted cinema. On the way he picks up a young girl (Nadia Mournuzi) with whom he has an on-off affair before she leaves him to embark on her travels once more.

Set during the early spring, Theo Angelopoulos's film evokes a world coming to life after its winter hibernation - of showers, watery sunshine and pinkish sunsets setting over mountainous rural landscapes. Such images of future promise contrast starkly with Spyros's mental state; his beekeeping business is in decline, his wife Anna (Jenny Roussea) no longer lives with him, while he has become estranged from his daughter. It seems that he embarks on an apparently never-ending road trip because he believes he has to rather than of his own own volition.

Unable to express himself except through physical acts, Spyros remains perpetually alienated from the landscape and the people inhabiting it. He visits several local communities, all of whom enjoy collective experiences of sitting outside, sipping their drinks and gossiping happily; but he can never involve himself in their lives. He remains an outsider, the object of cinematographer Giorgos Arvanitis's penetrating gaze.

Despite Mastrioanni's masterly performance notable mostly for its stillness rather than action, L'APICULTEUR proves an unpleasant cinematic experience. Spyros has done something in the past to alienate himself from his family; there is a suggestion that he is a actually a pedophile. On his daughter's wedding day he gathers her up in her arms in such a way as to denote excessive affection; later on he makes love to the girl on the cinema stage by smothering her, in spite of her repeated entreaties to let her go. It's as if he cannot endure the sight of young people as they remind him of his own mortality; hence he needs to deflower them of their innocence.

The cinema-image is also significant, suggesting the desire to exhibit all his seamier qualities in public. Angelopoulous intensifies that sense with a scopophilic obsession with photographing the girl in the nude, the camera lovingly tracking the contours of her body in a series of shots taken from Spyros's point of view. In the end we wonder whether she functions solely as an object of the director's and the leading character's misogyny.

The mood is one of unrelenting intensity that seems particularly redolent of the mid-Eighties, a time when anti-feminism was much more of an issue in Europe than it might be today. L'APICULTEUR 's certainly an art-house film, but one whose shortcomings need to be pointed out.",1471478400,,2819,5.106290672451193
8394873,4,B003DQ132M,"I come to this film as an ardent fan of the late great romantic actor, whose typical latin nonchalance as well as devastating screen presence (charisma) could frequently add a serene dignity (Casanova in La nuit de Varennes) or comical surreal flavour (Trois vie seul de mort) to his later films.

All of this is conveyed here in a portrayal that has been excavated from the inside rather than applied in layers.

This film is what serious European film making is all about and cannot be easily dismissed as boring, slow or tedious. Indeed the use of such terms says something more about the respondent's sensibility than the film itself. (On the UK website) However, this is a minority film, and probably a niche within that small group.

The general plot has been well described by those reviewers who were able to engage rather more successfully in the exisistential journey of the beekeeper. Interestingly those that dismiss it have done it very briefly and unconvincingly with little detailed objective reasoning or support for their reaction.

Those with some familiarity with 1970s and 1980s Greece - the Greece of the Generals, the American sponsored puppet fascist regime with a US aircraft carrier at anchor in Piraeus Bay lending immoral support to a widely despised and opposed undemocratic military regime (plus ca change!) - and the small towns and rural
backwaters which form the dull concrete monochrome background of the film, will recognise a refreshing truth in this film. It evokes an emotionally and politically depressed period in Greek history. It is not the Greece of Mamma Mia, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, or for that matter What Happens in Kavos Stays in Kavos. If you genuinely like that sort of tripe don't go here!

If I had enough brain power, or could join a film group discussion where we could discuss this point, I feel I could fully understand some of the references in the film's plot to that contemporary situation. For example, a scene where the naive girl becomes dangerously immersed in a barracks town, the crumbling housing and infrastructure, the brutalisation of social relationships which is a constant theme, in general and between her and him. In fact, some of this is quite shocking.

But what is one to make of the scene where the beekeeper and the girl sleep rough in a rundown old cinema and lay down in front of the screen with some half-hearted love making? Was this an ironic nod to Mastroianni's alter ego as the arch romantic latin leading man from his first career in such films as Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, and even more when he later parodied that in Casanova 1970, or City of Women. Was he not once voted ""the sexiest man in the world""?

So apart from everything else, and in tribute to an actor who was working at five or seven low budget art films per year throughout his life - not only to keep his expensive Parisian lifestyle going, but as a thoroughly committed professional, one has to view this example of his work within the arch of that career.

It is not easy to think of another actor in European cinema who has done so much. Because of that I loved this film, and in certain respects as listed above I admired the director and the film's aims in general.",1390608000,,3220,4.7272727272727275
