8717781,5,B00YASQVBA,"This anime is a masterpiece. Few people will understand the underlying meanings that it portrait, for those that do, congratulations! You deserve praise. For those that didn't, I recommend some reading on phylosophical books. It might help.",1487376000,3,240,5.513513513513513

8717784,3,B00YASQVBA,"Lovely to look at, confusing as hell. Set in a small seaside town, there's not so much a plot as a YA roundelay in which athletic tomboy Natsuki loves clumsy dweeb Kenji, who loves beautiful surfer Kahori, who loves handsome new transfer student Ryoichi, who has a mysterious agenda of his own. This, I take it, is why the movie obsessively compares itself to A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, although it's swapped out the comedy for adolescent angst and incoherent storytelling.

I swear I was awake and paying attention, but I still couldn't tell you what psychics, or psychic animals, or school wars or, god help me, a time travel subplot that makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER have to do with a scheme to save the world by prohibiting a bunch of middle school students from using cell phones on campus, but maybe none of this stuff is supposed to matter. It's really a story about falling in love for the first time, and having your heart broken for the first time, and if girls are crazy and boys are stupid, then nothing ever really changes.

Anyway, the movie is gorgeous to look at. The filmmakers are drunk on color and light, and saturate the screen with it via fireworks displays, seasonal foliage, hallucinatory underwater sequences, psychic soap bubbles, several swirling light shows from the time machine or whatever it is, and more lens flare FX than I've ever seen in one animated movie. If there had been a story here as well, instead of a feverish visual poem hinting at a story, it all would've been really impressive.",1482278400,2,1523,4.700374531835206
8717785,2,B00YASQVBA,"I'll start with saying this: this movie is pretty. The colors and visuals are great to look at. But just looking pretty doesn't make this a great or even good movie. The plot is a mess. Characters do things for reasons that aren't explained very well. The movie also doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. A light slice of life? A school romance? A mystery that the heroes have to solve? It has all these things yet when one scene is light and comedic then immediately followed by drama it gets jarring to say the least.

The movie also expects to just already know things about the characters and backstory. Does some elements of the plot need to be further explained? Yes. Does the film explain why or how? Of course not. You should already know, duh. The film is based on a book to my knowledge and it has been adapted before, so maybe those other iterations have the answers this telling ommits? Maybe, but this story should stand on its own without the need to look into previous established lore in alternate versions.

I should at least try to summarize the plot, too. There are a trio of friends, the generic male lead, his female childhood friend that is obviously in love with him yet he never notices, and her big breasted friend whom the male lead is in love with for reasons that aren't established. Then a mysterious transfer studint, who is totally not Kaworu from Eva, shows up and weird things start happening to their friends and other classmates. There is also some plot device about cell phones that goes no where.

The characters are bland. Like really bland. The main lead has no interesting personality or any uniqueness. The childhood friend is a run of the mill tsundere trope, getting angry at lead boy but pine for him in secret. The big breasted girl, well has big breasts. And is, like, totes nice. And Kaworu is there too. Oh, wait, no I forgot, he's totes NOT Kaworu.

Should you buy this film? No, I don't think so. It's worth a rent, I'll give it that, mostly for its pretty visuals.",1480377600,9,2019,4.478260869565218
