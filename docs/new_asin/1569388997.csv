187409,5,1569388997,I loved this series.  I was sorry to hear the show has been cancelled so there will be no more episodes.  I have all three sets and love them all.  Most of this set is very good.  There was one episode at a tennis match that was kind of slow.,1170806400,14,242,3.78
187436,5,1569388997,I love this series but disappointed that only a very few episodes are available to watch.,1486598400,,89,4.625
187437,4,1569388997,I really enjoyed this whole series. Some great mysteries wrapped around two women who consult on issues around gardening.,1486512000,,121,5.421052631578948
187438,5,1569388997,This one of my favorite mystery series. Rosemary and Laura compliment each other and there is a bit of humor throughout. Highly recommended.,1486252800,,140,5.130434782608695
187439,5,1569388997,"Absolutely loved it! Felicity Kendal is on of my favorite actresses, and Pam Kerr  was excellent throughout. The plots were always interesting, and as an  avid gardener, I couldn't get enough of all the gorgeous scenery. The gardens were spectacular and I really enjoyed the horticultural twist to so many of the stories. I am so,  so sad that Acorn TV ended the show as of February 1, 2017, but I'm really glad I had enough time to binge watch the whole series before it disappeared.  I would be tempted to purchase it on DVD to watch it again someday, but I imagine DVDs will become obsolete in the not too distant future, so I'll just have to have enjoyed the series this one time.  I was amused to notice  that there were vases of gorgeous flowers in just about every scene in every episode, and there were numerous details such as flowered curtains, upholstery, and clothing.  The set designers really played the floral theme to the max!",1486252800,2,942,4.571428571428571

187447,4,1569388997,"These two women are a pair who could be your neighbors.  I especially enjoy the gardening theme of the show, where nearly every frame has a lovely flower display in the background.  The interiors and the village characters are always interesting to me, even though the mysteries themselves are very conventional.  Unlike so many who-done-it series lately, these women are more curious than deadly; they aren't violent or hard-edged.  They are good investigators though.  Watching is like curling up with your favorite genre of detective mystery.  I wish there could have been more seasons.",1485388800,3,589,5.212765957446808

187492,5,1569388997,"I give this series 5 stars not because the scripts and plots are the best they could possibly be but because these ladies, their experiences, and their humor are all so endearing. After a trying day, watching an episode or two (or, yes, even three) at bedtime was a delight. I say ""was"" because all three seasons seemed to rush by and, before I knew it, Laura and Rosemary and their escapades were gone!  And I can't seem to find anything else that gives me a good feeling like these shows did. I don't know if men would like them so much, but they certainly made life more pleasant for this lady, and I believe they will for others.",1483401600,4,633,4.319327731092437

187538,5,1569388997,"PBS serial Rosemary and Thyme offers up such an interesting assortment of gardening tips, alongside British cultural themes.

187584,5,1569388997,"I love this series. Beautiful flowers, beautiful houses, beautiful clothes, and two very likable main characters. There are many things that don't make sense, like why did Laura turn down a share of the royalties for the seeds in ""Seeds of Time"" when the two women are always short of money and it won't be that long before they won't be able to do hard physical labor any more. They are closing in on 60 years old, after all. By the ""Cup of "" Silence,"" they can't even afford to repair the truck! And why are they paying for their own room and board when they're on a job? The clients should be paying for that unless they're being housed by the clients. For example, in ""Memory of Water,"" they buy a tent to save money on hotels; I don't understand why room and board should be coming out of their own pockets. In my husband's company, that's all billed to the clients. Anyway, I wanted to mention these things because I haven't seen them discussed anywhere else. I do miss the series in spite of some of the plot problems; it's a lot of fun and a good time.",1455148800,,1060,4.305

187595,4,1569388997,"Flowers and corpses -- those are the two things that you can expect to show up in ""Rosemary & Thyme,"" no matter where the girls go.

Expect lots of both in ""Rosemary and Thyme - Series Three,"" which even has the intrepid gardening detectives going abroad to Spain for a few episodes. Sadly this is the final season of the show, but it has the same sunny, homey, flower-scented charm as the two before it -- and of course, Felicity Kendal and Pam Ferris are enchantingly down-to-earth.

Laura (Ferris) and Rosemary (Kendal) arrive at an expensive hotel/winery, hoping to make enough money to fix the ancient Land Rover. But things go amiss when an old friend of Rosemary's, a notorious food critic, suddenly dies -- and Laura suspects that it was murder. Between shady wine deals, nettles and lots of people who wanted the guy dead, there is plenty to worry about.

Among other problems:
*They are summoned to renovate an ancient cathedral's herb garden, and quickly find the pastor's daughter dead. Clearly the quaint little community has some ugly secrets -- including multiple murders.
*A trip back to Laura's old home stirs up some memories. But while they're organizing the seed collection of a famous botanist, they find that some suspicious people are trying to get... something.
*A visit to South Spain to restore an old Moorish garden, which causes them to get enmeshed with an angry wife, a water dispute, and (of course) a dead body.
*While working on a memorial garden, Rosemary stumbles across an abandoned baby -- and they soon find a dead body as well. Now they not only have to find the killer, but the mother... assuming they aren't the same person.
*While working at a royal park, Laura and Rosemary find that someone is stealing their flowers. Au pairs, bohemian photographers, homeless people and a three-legged dog all wander around the place... until the dog's owner is found dead.
*An amateur stage production -- starring Rosemary's younger cousin -- goes horribly awry when one of the actors shoots himself with a loaded prop gun.
*While working for yet another friend of Rosemary's in a Spanish vacation town, the pair encounter a tennis player whose seemingly ordinary death may be something more sinister.

""Rosemary and Thyme"" is one of those charming British series that always seems very cozy and comfortable, no matter where they go or how many bodies pop up. Every episode is crammed with flowers, potting soil, slouchy clothes, sunshine and quaint villages -- which always makes it a mild shock when a corpse inevitably is found among the hedgerows.

Despite the corpses, the tone is pretty light and frothy, with lots of eccentric characters who double as excellent suspects. In fact, this would be an entertaining show even if it had no murders -- just consider the scene where Rosemary and Laura get drunk and talk about man problems... or rather, Laura talks and Rosemary keeps repeating the same phrase. Funniest part: Laura questioning whether her ex-husband measured her head while she slept.

But it does have some pretty decent mysteries -- at least one death per episode, and nobody except Laura and Rosemary are free of suspicion. There are scams, thefts, hidden crimes, missing persons and the odd abandoned baby, all tied into the murder of the day.

As always, Felicity Kendal and Pam Ferris are amazing -- prickly yet friendly, warm yet dogged. They're like the awesome middle-aged aunts you never had, charging around in a Land Rover with perpetually dirty knees and nails. And the two of them have a nice sisterly chemistry. Sometimes Laura and Rosemary get annoyed with each other (the night in the ""Ebenezer Scrooge""), but their bond is strong.

""Rosemary & Thyme - Series Three"" was sadly the end of Laura and Rosemary's adventures, but it's a delightful little light mystery series. Definitely a must-see.",1393459200,,3858,4.915514592933948
187598,5,1569388997,Great - Third series really stepped up the notable gardens and view but as always R&T were great.  Neat series.,1392336000,,111,4.55
187599,3,1569388997,"I first caught a few episodes on PBS, then found the entire three seasons available for free on youtube.  While we enjoyed the series, we learned by season 2 just how hacky the writing was, so we turned it into a drinking game.  Take a belt for every time the ladies: discovered a body but were never considered suspects; tampered with official evidence or even removing it from the crime scene; witnessed suspicious behavior by lurking behind shrubbery and other scenery; eavesdropped on pertinent conversations, whether from behind a door or across a meadow with wind blowing leaves from the trees (the ladies must have bat-hearing capabilities); or whenever they asked direct questions of any cop about any official police findings in an ongoing investigation (even if the just-met cop found them annoying), they always got a direct true answer about undisclosed evidence followed by the cop sharing his/her own theories with two gardeners who just happened to be on scene.  Just keep the bottle nearby, you'll need refills before an episode is finished.  Oh, P.S. Bonus Rounds: any guest appearance of an actor from Pride & Prejudice (BBC version -- Mr. Bingley!  Charlotte Lucas!  Mrs. Hurst!  Aunt Gardiner!) and any time any character appears in any variation of mom jeans.  I guess the budget went for landscaping, not costuming.",1390262400,,1337,5.045454545454546

The mystery plots themselves aren't super deep and the characters other than Rosemary and Laura are occasionally the standard 2-dimensional villains (don't expect Foyle's War level drama or plot) but the scenery is spectacular, and you won't consider the time wasted.",1383091200,,361,5.464285714285714
187602,4,1569388997,"If you have seen the first 2 in the series, #3 is as much fun as the first two.  If you're not familiar with the series: these are fun somewhat lightweight mysteries, always beautifully photographed in beautiful locations.  The dialogue is crisp and well written, and there is a delightful sarcasm/snarkiness that trickles through it at times that keeps me coming back to watch them over and over.

187604,5,1569388997,This is a great mystery series with a twist of comedy.  Sometimes they are a bit predictable and there always seems to be some small incident that never gets explained so it keeps you wondering.

187611,4,1569388997,I liked this series.  The characters portrayed by Felicity Kendal and Pam Ferris as professional gardeners in various European locales - was refreshing.  The story lines were entertaining - albeit a bit predictable.  I've watched the entire program (Series 1-3) and would have liked to see more.  I'm sorry the show was cancelled.

187615,5,1569388997,This is the perfect mystery show to watch before bed. The characters are adorable and the murders not very bloody. Also great to see a couple of older ladies getting great roles.,1377734400,,178,4.59375
187616,5,1569388997,"I enjoy this show- the main characters are good, funny and believable.  I love when they work in Italy or Spain and England.  The gardens are lovely.  Bad language doesn't happen and the mysteries are good.  A lot of mayhem, tho.",1377216000,,229,4.512195121951219

187638,4,1569388997,I like the relationship between the two female leads and the fact that they are not 20 year old plastic Barbies. I enjoyed the new settings in every episode and seeing some very beautiful gardens in each episode as well.,1374969600,,220,4.525

187650,4,1569388997,"I wish there were more episodes. Fun show with good chemistry between the leads. Minor mysteries, but enjoyable nonetheless.

187660,4,1569388997,This British series is another whodunit detective tale but with best friend gardeners as the crime solvers.  The change of venue is refreshing (various locations around Europe vice the gritty inner city streets)and the characters are not hardened detectives but nosey gardeners who always find themselves squarely stepping into some type of unpleasant situations.,1371168000,,363,5.722222222222222

Mysteries  are interesting and cleverly fun. Even my husband doesn't mind watching this series. If one loves gardening, traveling, cute personalities, and a bit of mysteries this is the show for you. And of course the Brits are always the best in TV.",1370649600,,398,4.91044776119403
187663,5,1569388997,I would watch this show forever just for the stories and the scenery. The ladies are wonderful actors and make for a most enjoyable mystery. Thankful for my Amazon Prime.,1370649600,,170,4.7
187664,5,1569388997,"This is an improved ""Murder She Wrote"".  No one seems to wonder why there are so many murders in the gardens these two have been engaged to repair.  I love the characters.  I suspend disbelief as the mystery is resolved.  It saddens me that there are only three seasons.",1370649600,,270,4.448979591836735
187665,5,1569388997,You really should start with the first season before coming to series 3 so you know how the ladies first got together. They are a great team and do not just stay in England.

I think it had a little too much murder, however.",1368144000,,124,4.391304347826087
187670,5,1569388997,"I just loved this series. The scenery is beautiful, the characters are likable and well developed and they have great chemistry.

187673,4,1569388997,"So, let me begin by saying i am a sucker for mystery series. I am an even bigger sucker for English mystery series. In addition to that, i have been in love with Felicity Kendal since the early 80's when etv used to re-run episodes of Good Neighbors. I started this series on [some other streaming service] when i ran out of Marple and Poirot, and loved the series. That other service only had the first two series, so i was thrilled to find another season when i switched to Prime. I wish that the series made a little more use of Rosemary's specialty as a plant pathologist, but watching the good old-fashioned gumshoe-type sleuthing the two ladies get up to is just as rewarding.",1367452800,,682,4.464
187674,4,1569388997,"I really enjoyed watching all three seasons of Rosemary & Thyme and was sad that there wasn't a fourth, fifth, etc.  Though each episode depicted one or more murders, they were light-hearted and interesting.  The homes and landscapes were extraordinarily beautiful, and the two characters were fun to watch as they gardened and unraveled one case after another.  Because I am an American, I am accustomed to American television programming, that focuses on characters under the age of 40!  It was so refreshing to watch two mature women who led active, interesting lives, as many of us do.  These women, their work and their friendship, were very real to me with their quirks and imperfections.

Whether you are a man or a woman, mature or young, if you enjoy murder mysteries (minus the gore), you will enjoy Rosemary & Thyme and it might just inspire you to go out and plant beautiful flowers, shrubs, and trees.",1367107200,,914,4.826923076923077
187675,4,1569388997,"I love the two female characters in this series, and the story lines!  Rosemary and Thyme take you to beautiful places as they go about doing their love, which, other than solving murders, is creating magnificent gardens.

187677,2,1569388997,"Remember Cabot Cove - Murder She Wrote? Well, here it is again. The writers seemed to have peaked at their second episode, and have been stretching their talents ever since - got very thin before the end of the first year.",1366243200,,222,4.439024390243903

187689,4,1569388997,"It's pretty funny how people will tell them everything as if they were the police. It's also entertaining when they say or do something embarrassing and they just move on with their investigation as if it were of no consequence. How they get their gardening jobs done is the real mystery in this show. Light entertainment, draws some laughs and many smiles.",1361836800,,357,4.774193548387097

187700,4,1569388997,"I love the Rosemary & Thyme shows and received the series 3 box set as a Holiday gift. I'm a huge fan of the British shows that air only on PBS stations in America. Whether it's a sitcom, a drama or mystery- the UK productions are much more tastfully done and often with a higher caliber of acting. Outstanding examples include Downton Abbey, Prime Suspect (UK with Helen Mirren), Cranford, Agatha Christie (Miss Marple/Poirot), Inspector Morse, Inspector Lewis, Inspector Lynley, Monarch of the Glen, Hamish MacBeth, Rosemary & Thyme, Sherlock Holmes and just about anything on Masterpiece (Classic/Contemporary/Mystery) American shows with their high-tech special effects, blood, gore, sex and the endless humiliating of one's self for money are a disgrace.",1325030400,,759,5.333333333333333

Of course it's unrealistic to have a murder in every beautiful garden in the UK but that's the fun of them. You get BEAUTIFUL locations and a fun mystery in every episode.

Truth be told, I simply enjoyed the other two seasons much better than this one. I love the two leading ladies and enjoy their characterizations, but the other characters were lacking in a way that didn't draw me in. As a premise, two ladies coming into my life to help me fix my garden(s) -- large or small -- requires me, as a supporting character, to be a strong foil; it's my job as a supporting role to make them look good.

Well, in this third series, I don't think the supporting characters make the ladies look good.",1214524800,3,743,4.082191780821918

After ""nearly sixty years"" on stage and screen, I think her youthful vitality still shines brightly and makes the whole series worth watching.

My wife and I have yet to figure out the plot on any of them. Sorting out relationships between characters is a full-time job. Heck, who needs to understand the episode? Relax and enjoy the beauty of the settings and the warmth of the leading ladies.",1193961600,6,545,4.677083333333333

The two professional gardeners/amateur sleuths embark on some pretty hair-raising adventures as they travel the globe.  Not only do they unearth secrets of the human heart they also solve seemingly impossible gardening puzzles.  The series takes you to some really beautiful locations, and it's worth watching just for the scenery.  We're treated to such places as Kew Gardens and Regent's Park in London, and Andalusia in southern Spain.  Kendall and Ferris really are a great pair of character actors.  It's hard to believe that the same Pam Ferris played the abusive, butch Miss Trunchbull in ""Matilda"".",1174262400,4,719,5.31858407079646

From rebuilding a long lost estate garden to designing a specialty showing for a tennis tournament in Spain, these girls dig in the dirt with enjoyment and interesting talent and manage to solve murders just as smoothly.

My favorite thing about these movies is that Laura and Rosemary are intelligent and confident of their own worth. They have fun in the work they have before them and make solving the crimes a pleasure to watch from beginning to the very end.

They fit together very well as a sleuthing duo and as two friends who are enjoying their lives whereever it takes them.",1173312000,9,795,4.705035971223022

Not to be taken seriously, but if you are weary of seeing gushing blood and every detail of wounds and dead bodies like so many programs on U.S. tv - this is to be cherished. People fall off roofs with only a small trickle of blood on their bodies to show for it. This is a good thing in my mind - I have a perfectly fine imagination and don't need to be assaulted with gore. The actresses are delightful. Charming, funny, cute, and actually adults! Since more than half the U.S. population is over 50, I would think there would be a huge following for this charming and entertaining series.

187727,4,1569388997,"Season three (the last season from what I hear) finds our savvy, wise and very humorous professional horticulturist and amateur detectives doing what they do best--planting, reviving, restoring and tending gorgeous gardens in various locales  including Spain that has a dark, handsome mysterious stranger on a white horse, and, of course, Great Britain  where, somehow, murders most foul seems to lurk or seem to be buried in the mulch or in irrigation canals.  Rosemary and Thyme's mature wisdom and humor are very evident in season three.  Felicity Kendal and Pam Ferris are per usual splendid as the aforesaid characters.  They solve splendidly some rather, to me,  convoluted murder/mysteries in season three.  However, it still does make for a most enjoyable time spent viewing these shows.

As I've said before the mysteries in this program, to me, are not as intriguing as say ""Morse"", ""Lynley"" or ""Frost""; however, due to the skills of the actresses and due to some peeks at some beautiful gardens, this is a most enjoyable series.  If it is indeed over, I will miss it immensely especially Felicity Kendal and Pam Ferris as Rosemary and Thyme.",1171324800,23,1152,5.052910052910053

Two women, each have a Life changing experience just before the series starts. Soon they become friends. One a hands on gardener, with a law enforcement back ground Laura Thyme, (Pam Ferris), the other an academic horticulturist with an old four wheeler vehicle Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal).

The programs are of the two trying to find out who dunnit and how. We do not get bogged down in love interests.

Each episode is unique in its approach. The only pattern I see is that it is like in the movie ""A shot in the dark"" where everyone is guilty except the maid. In this series there may not be a lit of murderers, however there are a lot of guilty people.
