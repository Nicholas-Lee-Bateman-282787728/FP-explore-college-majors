8047851,1,B0007KY84W,There are not that many documentaries out there on Latin America and when you find one you expect a lot more than this. Not only is it poor quality it is also so over priced. For that price I would have expected at least 7 or 8 hours at least not a DVD of less than 1 hour. My advise is. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD you will only be wasteing your money.,1186963200,4,345,3.73972602739726
