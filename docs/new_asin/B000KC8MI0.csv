8155586,1,B000KC8MI0,"absolutly worthless!!!  If you wish to learn Egyptian Hieroglyphs on your own, get How To Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs by Mark Collier and Bill Manley,and a hierolyphic dictionary. After you master Collier's book you can move on to other books like Gardener's Egyptian Gramer. Stay away from this DVD, they even left out two symbles in the alphabet one the flax symble which is very important, used in the name Ptah. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it less.",1240272000,7,465,4.7407407407407405
