8745861,5,B019QSYHL4,"I had said once to someone that was unfamiliar with Noah Baumbach that I experience in his films a sort of validation that is kind of like having a fun cousin who lives in another state who you only get to see once a year but when that opportunity arrives its always something special. It's like this cousin gets you, maybe better than anyone ever has or will. He or she sees the world in a way that cuts through the BS but not in a deeply depressing way rather in a fashionably sad way that is more satisfying than being happy. This cousin is cool in a sincerely intellectual manner like how cool smart people used to be and it makes you feel cool even if you're not quite as smart. You spend the winter wondering what this cousin is up to and when summer comes around and you are with them you don't want it to be over and you try not to get all emotional about it but you always do. That's how Noah Baumbach movies make me feel. My imaginary version of Noah Baumbach is the embodiment of what I think his films are trying to say. I don't actually think we'd be friends in real life but in some sideways universe where we are just two pedestrian wits I think maybe we'd hit it off. It's a pretty speculative proclamation especially considering its based on nothing beyond the fact that I relate to the themes and ideas of his films but my point in mentioning it is to emphasize how much I appreciate his filmography. Mistress America teams Greta Gerwig back up with Baumbach to deliver a stylized, witty, sharp, charming, offbeat and substantive presentation of failure and loneliness in the modern world. The score and music selection along with the type of humor compliments the film with reflections of a John Hughes 80's quality. Mistress America  is not necessarily riddled with jokes. It's humor is derived from its characters personality flaws which are quite unlikable, nonetheless they speak to flaws of varying degrees in all of us. That's why ultimately we enjoy Baumbach's difficult characters. Mistress America's characters are as interesting and complex to sustain pleasure all the way through. If you are a fan of his previous films I can't imagine this one will be disappointing although it is a lighter affair plot-wise more akin to Frances Ha than the Squid and the Whale.",1465171200,,2292,4.576642335766423
