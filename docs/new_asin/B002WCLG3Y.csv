4006614,4,B002WCLG3Y,"Awesome, loved this movie!  The different style are incredible, and it looks like this movie had a huge budget, very slick.  I didn't care for the american produced segments as much, but loved all the rest.  the japanese segmnts were weirder than I thought, and it doesn't go with all the canon of Halo.

I wasn't sure how this ties into ODST.  Also, is this tying directly into the Halo prequel somehow, coming out in a few months?  It was a bit confusing.  And some of it goes against older Halo ideas, but all in all, I loved it!!

But all in all, amazing.  Two great animes in one week - Halo and Dante's Inferno! If only the rest of the months had this much cool stuff out!",1265587200,,678,4.234375
4006615,1,B002WCLG3Y,I was so excited to hear that this was coming out i thought that wow a halo movie finally coming out. But what do they do they make several short stories about the halo universe. You think that they would make a full lenght feature film but noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo thay had to ruin this by making several short stories. Buy this only if you are a halo fan.,1264204800,,386,4.776119402985074
4006616,5,B002WCLG3Y,"Ok so I might not have the best title for this, but I for one can give at least a small reveiw for this in general because I've been watching these on Halo Waypoint.

Anyways Overall this may or may not add to halo ( Some fanboys get upset due to contradictions, while others (like myself) enjoy this for the addition to the halo universe).  As far as each invidual episode goes, they are each made by different producers much like the other person mentioned. That being said, it really brings a whole new take on halo. The art styles alone on some of the episodes are just great.

Overall I'd can personally suggest anyone who enojoyed halo should buy OR at LEAST rent this.",1263427200,6,675,4.384
4006617,5,B002WCLG3Y,"To Quote Zing31 review, ""This movie ""Halo Legends"" does not have English subtitles... nothing new with Microsoft  Except listed, Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Japanese. I can never figure why Amazon allows reviews of items not yet released?  First review has a one star but he is NOT reviewing the movie, just his hatred for Microsoft.  I'm looking forward to the release of Halo Legends. As an Anime fan with studios such as Production I.G (Ghost in the Shell, Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade and Blood: The Last Vampire), Bones (Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, Fullmetal Alchemist, Sword of the Stranger and Eureka Seven), STUDIO4XC (The Animatrix, Tekkonkinkreet and Batman: Gotham Knight), Casio Entertainment, and Toei Animation. For Fans and alike of Halo, You can find shorts previews of the Anime at; [...]
or the Halo site, [...]  Judge for yourself if you're interested in Halo Legends.

 Side Note; I own both gaming machines, Xbox 360 and the PS3. On line gaming goes to the 360 with Xbox live. Luv the PS3 for Blu-ray. I also purchased a Sony Bravia LCD HDTV from Amazon which is outstanding. Summer of 2010 I'm upgrading to Sony's 3D HDTV,  Sony BDP-S770 (player), Bravia 60LX900 (HDTV).  3D Blu-rays and 3D Gaming are on the way. Don;t forget to upgrade your cable to HDMI 1.4 for 3D displays.  If you end up purchasing ""Halo Legends"" from Amazon, Enjoy.",1263168000,26,1363,4.891304347826087
4006618,1,B002WCLG3Y,"I remember when I first got XBOX in 2001 and played Halo and it has no English subtitles and I got real mad and so does rest of my deaf buddies.  I returned the game and my deaf friend returned whole thing the system and the game.  He got Playstation instead.  I stay with Xbox for long time then Halo 2 came then it only have half way english subtitles!!!  Arggh!!  I got real mad at Microsoft. So I fed up and sold my Xbox and then 360 came and I was hoping Halo 3 would be good enough but it turn out sucks!  I fed up and sold Xbox 360 and I have Playstaion 3 and I love it every since. Sony games have subtitles which is good thing for me and my deaf buddies.  This movie ""Halo Legends"" does not have english subtitles... nothing new with Microsoft.

4. Homecoming

6. Prototype
7. The Babysitter
8. The Package
It's a great collection of movies (each in between 10-20 minutes for a total of 2 hours). However, the episode Odd One Out, is a little weird and made me kind of angry. SPOILER ALERT! In The Duel, The Arbiter dies, which made me a little angry. Some sequences and parts of the movie are questionable. All-in-all, it's an interesting DVD that Halo fans should watch!",1433894400,,575,4.76

4006666,2,B002WCLG3Y,"some people may say that it's original and its beautifully done, however i disagree, it was quite ugly  at times, and the story's couldn't of been more out of touch with the universe, anyway it's not for me however others may like it",1396656000,,233,4.4186046511627906

4006671,2,B002WCLG3Y,"Most of the stories have some problem with the story they're telling matching the world presented in the rest of halo.
ODSTs make tons on rookie mistakes when they're supposed to be military elite. A52 year old woman looks like she's in her mid 20s. One spartan put in charge of an operation won't talk to her team until she gets hit in the head, removes her helmet and all of the sudden she has plenty to say. The elites are Japanese? There were plenty more problems than just getting details right, like some episodes had unbearable animation",1394323200,,544,4.561224489795919

4006674,4,B002WCLG3Y,I have Ben playing halo video games since it was first released years ago. The movie is a great add on to my collection. I would recommend this movie to anyone over 13 who likes a nice futuristic action and if you played the game.,1392163200,,230,4.133333333333334
4006675,5,B002WCLG3Y,"This is great for some Halo history, as a comedy, a drama, and just fun TV watching. My little brother even enjoys watching this, even though a lot of it goes over his head. This is a must have for any Halo fan. It tells great story even from the other side of the conflict.",1390262400,,274,4.0
4006676,4,B002WCLG3Y,"It was not so bad. Episodes after ''O.O.O'' were quite good, however the last one was not so much. I think art and animation itself could've been great, if 90% of it wasn't done in Japanese style. It's a good animation to watch for people desiring to know more about Halo Universe.",1390003200,,281,4.423076923076923

4006679,3,B002WCLG3Y,I know it was different stories but I'd of wanted to see more of master chief he is the greatest man ever lol competing from a hard core gamer and lover of halo,1386979200,,160,3.878787878787879

4006681,2,B002WCLG3Y,I am sorry but I could not get into most of the stories with the Japanese anime. A few were fine but most were just not done well at all and somewhat ridiculous. I don't dislike anime and I am not saying they could not have done Halo more justice but they mostly missed the mark.,1386115200,,279,4.0

I have read most of the novels and the comics and loved the Forward Unto Dawn web series. The 8 stories on this DVD tell different stories set in the Halo universe from numerous times and places. Only one of the stories directly features The Master Chief, but that's fine. Seeing a mixture of anime styles mashing with Halo was a blast.",1380844800,,462,4.447058823529412
4006685,3,B002WCLG3Y,This one is one of the best and I recommend it to the followers of Halo itself. It supersedes the live action one and demands you to pay attention to their tale and hang on for the ride.,1380844800,,186,3.9210526315789473

That being said, the Halo Universe is without a doubt a most exciting place to visit. I can now understand why this game is so popular.
While the graphics are different for each segment, and very much different from Halo 4 and since I am not a gamer and have no idea what, where, who or why, this does explain some of the characters. I am sure that anyone who enjoys such sci-fi will find this enjoyable.",1368921600,,460,4.238636363636363

The stories aren't ""bad"" it just that its done in an Anime art style and the writing caters to Japaneses audience. Its full of stereotypes. I wish the stories weren't cannon to Halo's lore but....oh well.

I like The Duel and origins. The others didn't resonate with me. Your results may vary. If you can get it for $10, do it. Otherwise, you aren't missing much.",1361836800,,515,4.298969072164948
4006706,5,B002WCLG3Y,"This is an interesting collection of short animated stories across different characters during different times throughout the Halo Universe, and no two stories are the same due to the production and the style of animation involved.

Almost all story choices were lackluster & the storytelling fell victim to the classic anime blunder of: ""Ooh look at the pretty pictures & isn't slapstick funny"", the concept behind this production is fine - a chance to examine the Halo universe in new & different ways along different paths; however the execution is severely lacking. Instead of examining the integration of Human & Covenant forces and the consequences and difficulties through the eyes of say: a Grunt, or a new human recruit who lost family or friends to the Covenant, or a grizzled veteran Elite who has been fighting Humans since the war began we got lots of exposition in the form of story hour with pictures that retold what we already know & was mostly already explained in the games. So in closing I would ask, ""What was the point of this production artistically - not financially we already know the point of this production financially- since there was very little added to the Halo universe, either in story, examination of alternate view points, review & exploration of events that were not given even time to develop properly in the games or other media?""",1360022400,,1303,4.6943231441048034

*Disclaimer*
It should be noted that I love Japanese people of all sorts. I enjoy anime at about the same rate I enjoy Hollywood - most of it is crap. I don't feel being drawn makes bad productions good - let alone drawn as cheaply as possible - which is how anime developed it's aesthetic in the first place.

4006724,3,B002WCLG3Y,"The disk case that I received had a large scratch that went deep into the plastic on the front of it. Luckily, the disks themselves were in perfect condition.

The quality of the Halo Legends dvd is a different matter. If you're a large fan of the lore, then a lot of the things you'll see in this don't make too much sense. Spartans don't act like Spartans, feelings are drawn out to unfathomable extremes.

The introduction into the universe that Halo Legends offers (Origins I, II) were actually pretty great. For fanatics and casuals alike, it was a neat, somewhat basic explanation of the lore. There was stuff that was left out, but I think it was supposed to be simplistic. Something to give you a good picture of the Forerunners, and talked a lot about human traits.

There was a story of a Sangheili (Elite) that questioned the religion of the Prophets. It showed a small length of what happened when you went against strict authority in the Covenant, even if it was something as small as not believing a religion. The characters were slightly strange though, the protagonist's wife giggled like a school girl, and had a strange look about her. It's been described as ""artistic interpretation"", but it's still weird. The end was drawn out too much, only for an unsatisfying conclusion. It was a good, four-stars though. There were a lot of good things in it that I'll let you experience for yourself if you decide to purchase this item.

There was another story of a Spartan who wanted to run away after receiving her augmentations, and being trained for seven years or so. People who've invested themselves in the lore will not be happy with this story. There is a small group of Spartans (before they saw any service in their armor) who wanted to run away and get back to their old lives. Knowing that Spartans had been indoctrinated for war from a young age, this seemed highly unlikely. The protagonist was not afraid to show her over-exaggerated feelings at every turn. It definitely went against the strong, stoic super soldiers that Spartans are generally shown as. Two stars might be pushing it.

There were a few others that had the same issues, but one short was especially atrocious. It was a non-canonical story of Spartan 1337. It was a bad attempt at humor for the lore. The character is goofy (Although his voice actor wasn't too bad), there were dinosaurs, and a large ape-thing that was involved. It was pretty terrible.

The Babysitter, as it is called, is one of my favorites. It follows a group of ODSTs in their next mission to assassinate a Prophet. There was a Spartan involved, and it showed the tension between Spartans and ODSTs fairly well. The different height dimensions for some of the ODSTs were a little odd, but it can be overlooked. The end was a little cliche, but it was still one of the better stories this dvd had to offer.

The Package used CGI instead of anime styled drawings. It was neat a few years ago, but if you've ever watched Red vs. Blue, you might not be too amazed with the animations now. One Spartan's jaw was absolutely ridiculous. So ridiculous that I had to put it in this review. Some of the more well known Spartans like Fred and Kelly had a part in this. Although I feel like they weren't pictured spot on, it wasn't terrible either. There were a lot of terrible lines purposely implemented into this short that really bothered me. It was way to cheesy for my liking.

On a side note, there was an unfinished battle between the Master Chief and an Elite Major here. From doing a lot of research, that same elite seems to manufacture weapons now. It's been speculated that he will return in the Reclaimer trilogy. I'd love to finish the fight between Chief and that Elite in one of the future games, no pun intended.

Overall, it's something to think about if you've got an extra 20$ laying around. I don't regret buying it, but I could've gone on without it, too.",1350604800,3,3931,4.588319088319088
4006725,3,B002WCLG3Y,"You'd expect a collection of animated shorts about the Halo universe to be much better than the usual drivel thrown out there by other companies.

The Halo universe has been fleshed out over 11 years in video games, books, graphic novels, and Way Point. This adds almost nothing to the mythos.

If you are a die- hard Halo fan then this is for you. Anyone not familiar with the series will surely be left with one impression ""meh"".

I for one hate the 'anime' style, it looks sloppy, and since the original dialogue is recorded and lip synced in Japanese it reminds me of the old Godzilla movies.

Origins I and II - This two part opener is absolutely amazing. The depiction of the flood destroying the universe is truly amazing. The music in this one really drives it home too. Great short on the creation of the Halo universe and what led to Halo 1.
The Duel - If you are a fan of Japanese Cinema or the films of Masaki Kobayashi, this is a must watch. It feels like ""Harakiri"" or ""Samurai Rebellion"" has been put into the world of the elites. Great tale of honor, action, and interesting animation style.
Homecoming - This is an okay short. Probably the weakest in that there isn't much too it. Probably the most drab and boring of the animation styles.
Odd One Out - This is a rather goofy and silly short. Can't say much about it.
The Prototype - This is easily the best of the shorts. Oh my goodness. Amazing animation style, tons of great animation, and a powerful story too. Tons of robot mech action in this.
The Babysitter - A rather interesting short of a sniper mission. Good story, nothing special though.
The Package - This is basically action from beginning to end. This one basically looks like an extended cut scene from the games. Good action, and some very cool moves (in one scene Chief reloads his SMG's with ammo coming out of his legs and does a rotating flip over a bunch of enemies, great stuff).

So overall, this is worth the purchase. There are some very good supplements on here as well explaining the creative process behind each short. So, Origins I and II and The Prototype are my favorite of the shorts. Than, The Duel and The Package. While Homecoming, Odd One Out, and The Babysitter, while not horrible, are just fair viewing.",1334966400,,1862,4.457478005865102
4006730,4,B002WCLG3Y,"Halo Legends Blu-ray:

So glad this movie was produced in recent years... It incorporates all the elements of the XBOX games, including Halo Reach, which at the time of this release, had not itself been released. The movie producers must've had inside Bungee intel, because the look and feel of this movie definetly has aspects of Reach...

I guess the blu-ray version is better, yet i don't see how an animated movie could even be in high def? Maybe the backgrounds are better, and yes blu-ray comes in righteous 7.1 channel surround sound (when offerred)... Some minor issues with the contrast and ghosting (my TV is a brand new full HD Sharp), slight noise filter over the animated characters, probably due to too many pixels where there shouldn't be. Very cool movie though, made a Halo fan out of me where previously i was not! I went out and bought the whole video game series 1 week after originally watching this movie in May of 2011. I would have rather bought the special edition DVD version with 2 disc set instead; because the picture is probably going to be the same. :/

This great film provides a lot of insight into the Halo universe, and once u watch it, it is hard to forget. Truly original (i think) storytelling and approach in animation. Each short has it's own style, but all are entertaining, especially the full CGI final short, which showcases Master Chief and his crew doing their thing in marvelous spectacle, while trying to board a Covenant mother ship from one seat speeders in space!

It kind of reminds me of ""Animatrix"" even though the stories and animation were wayyyyy better in that movie. But it's sort of the same in comparison that Halo Legends is a series of short stories each of which are animated by someone different. These stories though however are boring and are very cheaply animated. I don't have the disk on me at this moment so I can't get the name to the one story, but it looks like it's terribly done 3d animation, and it's as if they knew it was terrible because they cover the whole sequence with this cloudy effect as if they're trying to mask the poor animation. The end result makes the Playstation 1 graphics look like the movie Avatar. The stories are terrible as well.

It's all anime, I thought it was just drawn by Japanese or done in an Eastern style, no. The whole thing is written, drawn, produced and everything else in Japan.

Having read all the books when I finished watching this it made me think that the directors didn't have a feel for the games or the previous adventures and set out to do their own thing. The package had good animation but was just too corny and over the top. I skipped the duel and odd one out because as a fan of Halo I couldn't stand for how lame this was.

  This movie is terrible ESPECIALLY if your a big Halo fan. First off I was excited, but when I found out it was going to be Anime I wasn't as encouraged to watch it, I bit my tongue and watched it anyway. I was right, not only is it poorly done even by Anime standards but it makes a mockery of the whole series of games by making it some cheesy half witted group of scatter brained mini series'. Just the whole Spartan 1339 part was typical corny Anime junk like Pokemon and all the other poppy junk. Spartans are genetically engineered killing machines not crazed idiotic contortionists. This movie way under shot its mark and took the ""Bad ass"" quality of Halo and the whole battle riddled world the Spartans defend, and made it cute and cuddly land of stupidity with pet dinosaurs and Covenent Samurai sitting at their dinner tables conversing with there wives over a cup of tea before teaching at their Dojo... seriously thats whats in the movie.

  I can't stress enough that actually watching this made me even more angry with Microsoft. If your going to just throw funding away for a piece of crap like this movie, why not make an actual movie that's not garbage. Your better off holding on to the dream of ""maybe someday they'll make a movie and its going to be awesome!"" rather than have it obliterated by this movie.",1294876800,,1367,4.469879518072289
4006751,1,B002WCLG3Y,"This is the worst animation I've ever watched till date and yes I'm over 30. Basically, the story proceeds with human evolution in documentary style.
Story or script, is complete failure. After hundred thousands years, soldiers still utter 'Oh Jesus' in dire situation(every civilization so far don't track history more than say at least 1000 years, We don't know who was there before Jesus, but this animation simply assumes you a moron). I know it's just a figment of someone's imagination but presented in very haphazard way. At least they could have added some relevancy of the facts, that would have made it much watchable. And, if you have migraine, I'm pretty sure, this will give you good migraine attack if you keep watching that stupid watercolor style blurry, eye straining animation somewhere in the beginning. Furthermore, there are different stories attached, so, you will end up being clueless what did you just watch?

The animations is really basic, at first even watercolor like.  The story is told more in pictures than in actual animation.  I did not realize that this was several short stories (around 10 min each) and not a continuing story.  I stopped watching after DUEL, then I decided to give it another try and the watercolors went to Japanese animation type, but still very basic.  The stories were as basic as the animation and I never did finish the whole DVD.  I got it on sale for $2 and feel I wasted my money.

Its not anime in itself, rather an attempt of anime by western creators, the thing is that the HALO stories were actually done by japaneese artist and directors so I guess they were trying to envision a western public since HALO isn't that big in Japan. And you definitely feel that in the stories, so bottom line: if you like HALO and just want to have some fun on random stories about HALO not of HALO itself then you will like this movie, if you want true anime... this is not it, although its not bad, and if you want some background or obscure stories about the game... then this is also not for you.",1288310400,,778,4.228187919463087

I really liked these stories.  I am also a fan of the Animatrix though too.

I thought they did a nice job in terms of alluding to how big the war is, but also including the human element.  I really liked the Duel in particular, because it was told from the viewpoint of the Covenant's side.  The stylized animation for that one adds to the story.

Also: Under Special Features, there is the Story of Halo So Far.  This is a key featurette.  I have mixed feelings whether I would recommend watching it 1st or after you've watched all the episodes.  Has a lot of key info in there that might help explain what's going on in the individual episodes as you watch them, but at the same time, maybe I got more out of this because I *didn't* understand as much and had to put things together myself as I watched the episodes.

I do understand why some people Hate It or Didn't Like It which is because there is alot of Playstation 3 Fans and Fans of the previous versions of Playstation out there. Halo Legends is base on those video games for the X-Box and X-Box 360 and other sources in which I love the Halo Video Games for it is the BEST First-person shooter Ever for at least the way the Covenant and the Flood fight back against you when you play it on Legendary. There is 8 stories but I like the last four stories better which are: (1)Odd One Out which is a silly funny with a Dragon Ball flavor, (2)Prototype, (3)The Babysitter and (4)The Package in which I love this story the most for if you are a Fan of the Halo Game Series you will know why.

Overall this is an excellent DVD set graphically, visually, acousticly, and story wise but has a tendency to be a bit of a downer. Not surprising considering the nature of the Halo universe and how humans get the short end of the stick. That said some stories are also incredibly up lifting while at the same time being somewhat depressing.

And while Halo Legends is not exactly a thought provoking master piece I found myself contemplating the themes of each story, except one, quite deeply even several days after viewing them.

Start a series similar to what Fox has done with Family Guy or American Dad - a weekly dose of Halo, Master Chief and all the back stories (or from the MC's recent internment forward) and give those who enjoy the military sci-fi of that world something weekly to look forward to.",1272240000,,665,4.55
4006769,4,B002WCLG3Y,"This is an interesting conglomeration of stories about the Halo Universe, although it is not what I had anticipated. The style of animation varies from story to story, making each more unique, but it also makes the episodes more isolated from each other. I enjoyed watching all of the 'legends,' some of which are more to informative about the Halo universe, while others (Odd One Out), are more entertaining. This is a good choice for Halo fans, and although it not as useful for viewers who are not particularly interested in the history of the Halo universe, Halo Legends will still provide some entertainment, though more so in the later episodes.",1272240000,,651,4.873873873873874
4006770,3,B002WCLG3Y,"Several other reviewers have gone through and related their thoughts on each of the shorts contained in Halo: Legends.  This is certainly a valid method, and helpful to the practical buyer who simply wishes to get a general idea of whether or not the product suits him/her.  I would like to take a different approach.  I will divide the episodes into thematically similar groupings, and analyze them from that standpoint.

Origins, parts I and II, is historical.  It is essentially a condensed version of the history of the Halo Universe.

Odd One Out is an attempt at comedy, plain and simple.  Whether you as the viewer find it humorous or not will likely depend on your...sense of humor.  Not being averse to the Japanese penchant for the ridiculous, I did find portions of it to be funny, though it's not comedic genius in the least.

The Package, and The Duel are both what I would consider to be action-oriented shorts, and in that way will likely appeal more to the fanbase of the Halo Series than any of the others.  The Package fills this role far better than The Duel, as The Duel contains many canonical errors that will bother serious fans of the series (from kimono-clad Elites to the number of mandibles).  The Package best captures the feel of frenetic action that has embodied the Halo Series from the first game.  In it, a team of Spartans attacks a Covenant fleet in order to recover a...well...package.  The short uses a CG-animation hybrid style (this is the only short to do so), which also lends the short more of a Western feel than the other shorts in general.

The final three episodes: ""The Babysitter,"" ""Homecoming,"" and ""The Prototype"" fall into what I would call heroic tragedy.  For serious fans of Halo, particularly ones who care about the canon, these episodes will likely elicit some of the most visceral reactions.  There is a serious disregard for realism in these episodes, from the teddy bear keychain accessory hanging from the Spartan's armor (or maybe her rifle?) in ""Homecoming,"" to the Gundam-inspired mecha suit in ""The Prototype.""  However, in spite of these obvious problems, I found these episodes the most compelling.

What we often forget in the context of the Halo Universe, especially because the games are so action-centered (and feature a character capable of annihilating hundreds upon hundreds of the alien enemy without suffering so much as a scratch), is that the war between the Humans and the Covenant has been in progress for twenty-seven years by the time of the events in Halo 3 - and Humanity has been losing...badly.  These three episodes capture how thoroughly Humanity lost the war by exposing us to the level of sacrifice that was so commonplace throughout it - and which seems so needless in the light of the fact that the Covenant killed billions upon billions of people whenever they glassed a planet.  The heroism displayed by the protagonists in each of these three episodes is thus all the more tragic because we must ask, inevitably, whether their sacrifices even mattered.

So who would I recommend Halo: Legends to?  Anime fans, for one.  The shorts are experimental in nature, but retain the essence of Japanese storytelling, which emphasizes emotion over realism.  Coming from a nation that has not engaged in a real war (no, sending token SDF forces to combat zones does not count) in over sixty years, the lack of what we in the U.S. would consider ""realistic"" dialogue between soldiers, or ""realistic"" combat techniques is understandable.  However, many of those in the audience will not be so forgiving.  So the real question for those wishing to purchase Halo: Legends is: can you set aside your desire for realism and a Western storyline for ten minutes at a time while each short episode runs its course?  If the answer is yes, then you will probably enjoy Halo: Legends.  If not, then don't bother, it's not worth your time.",1271980800,15,3910,4.8390977443609025
4006771,2,B002WCLG3Y,"I'm a pretty big Halo fan, having played all the games and read most the books. So when Legends was released I was pretty excited. But unfortuanteley it's not anything near the quality and calibur I've come to expect from the Halo brand. Some of the stories are well done, with good animation and sound. But many are just wierd, and don't fit into the rest of the Halo mythos at all. The opening story is a two part episode, I don't know why they cut it in half, but it's almost the same as the history story on Animatrix. It's rather well done, and in my opinion the best part of the disc, documenting the history of the Halo universe and giving us our first views of the Forerunners.

The rest of the films are rather, meh. Some have poor cinematics and even wierder stories. The japanese influence on the series went way overboard. One feature was the story of an elite rebel, with the Elite culture depicted as a samurai one. Another film featured an emo anime soldier on a mission to destroy a prototype mech robot to keep it from falling into Covenant hands.

The only other mini film I liked was the last one, a fast paced CG animation work that features Master Chief and several other Spartans on a rescue mission. Again, it's plagued by inconsistancies with the books, and leaves you wondering when there was ever a fat simoan spartan. But over all it's pretty good. It really shows off the elite combat skills the spartans are well known for.

In the end, I'd say you should just rent or borrow this movie.",1271289600,,1516,4.426523297491039

Each episode is different in how its set up, some are funny were some are serious while some just explain halo.  Bones did a very good job on the videos but I think they could have done it with out ""The Duel"" and made the ""The Package"" the one with Master Chief with the computer animations less cheesy.  Over all this is a great product and was worth buying and if you are a halo fan then I recommend this to you.

Overall, the production value of each short is excellent.  About half (Origins I+II, Homecoming, The Duel) of the shorts were more lore/canon-heavy than I preferred.  The other four shorts were more what I expected (animated alien-shooting action).

I'm glad I NetFlix'd this as I didn't really care for half of the content.  If you're really into Halo lore, you might enjoy it more.

4006781,1,B002WCLG3Y,"There has been written a lot already about Halo Legends in the comments, so I am trying to make it short: it was a really disappointing experience.

Most important: DO NOT BUY THE BLU-RAY if it costs more than the DVD. The graphics of most episodes are so basic, simple and even blurred, that you do not need HDTV-resolution to watch it nor benefit from paying for the extra pixels.

About the stories: sorry, but most of them are so simple, that I don't understand how people here can be even a little positive about them. I played Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3 and ODST and loved them all including the story. I read three of the Halo books, the others are waiting in the shelf to be read soon. So far I liked all of them. The stories are not the most complex or a re-invention of SciFi, but considered that this is a game we are talking about, they are definitey great and a fun experience. But this DVD? Sorry, but my little daughter could have written those storylines.

About the graphics: some animations of the stories were so basic, they were closer to a slideshow of still pictures than to being something worth of being called a cartoon. Plus the graphics were totally influenced by their japanese creators. The houses from the Elites looked like Japanese temples and the dress of the enemy in the third episode looked like a Japanese Samurai Warrior. That's not bad per se, but also not really creative and from good SciFi I expect a little more than a pure replication of our own world.

The only exception with respect to look&feel is the last episode ""The Package"". And now I know, why Microsoft used a part from that episode on the XBox as the advertisement for the DVD. ANY of the other episodes would just not have been convincing enough to be shown as an appetizer.

And yes, the whole stuff on the DVD reminds you totally of the Animatrix! The BIG difference being, that the Animatrix was a free extra on the regular movie DVD whereas you have to pay 25 US$ for this Blu-Ray or still over 16 US$ for the DVD of Halo Legends.

After seeing all 8 episodes I was asking myself ""and when does the real thing start?"". This is like a DVD full of bonus material but with the actual movie itself missing!

Sorry, but this time I feel really tricked by Bungie and Warner. Even if you are a fan of Halo, think twice before you waste your money and time on that. And don't think you would really miss any of the background information of the Halo Universe. Having fought against the Flood in any of the games should give you a good idea, why the Forerunners lost the battle in the end and had to built the Halo rings. Even worse, in the two Episodes Origins and Origins II they are showing, that the Forerunners had collected sample of the life of many planets in our galaxy to redeploy them after activating the Halo rings thus exterminating all and any life in the milky way. Funny enough, they ""forgot"" to include themselves in this Ark, so all life forms could be preserved and re-introduced on their planets, except the Forerunners. Sorry, but even humanity would not be so stupid to built an ark and then forget to put at least some humans into it. But a far more evolved species like the forerunners does forget themselves? Yeah, right!",1269388800,3,3243,4.431208053691275

4006787,2,B002WCLG3Y,"OK I have been following HALO and playing it since the initial release. I have read the book, beat all the games and seen all the behind the scenes stuff and backstory content type deals. I had REALLY high hopes for this but was throughly disappointed. One or two of the stories was decent but thats just it, >decent<. Most were very cliche' and they were all pretty short.

Possible spoilers may follow depending on how fast you forget things you read:

One of the video shorts style was to be out of focus, so out of focus that you can't even follow combat mostly and the story was just not entirely fulfilling.

Another was like they were trying to make an episode of Dragonball Z, which don't get me wrong I like Dragonball but thats not the universe that these stories are supposed to be taking place in. I'm sorry but the Spartans aren't supposed to be able to defy gravity or take what appear to be world ending death beams, let alone normal humans! Oh and did I mention the kids in cavemen outfits and that had a pet T-REX?!

In one episode there is talk of a spartan dying on a mission that had taken place by the personnel on a UNSC ship, this makes no sense for several reasons. The foremost being that Spartans are never listed as KIA, only MIA and the fact that there is no way the normal personnel would have any idea of what happened on a mission with a Spartan. This part of my review is nitpicky I know but all the books just illustrated these little facts so much that it was annoying to me.

Now for the last episode, good grief! First off one spartan just goes off on a whim and dies and doesn't even confirm with team leader 117. Sorry but after over a decade of training and discipline do you really think the proclaimed ""Ultimate Soldier"" would do anything like that let alone be condoned by a teammate? Then they introduce Dr. Halsey who was supposed to be woman well established in her field when the Spartans didn't even exist yet, she picked them and made them. So why about 15-20years later would she look like a woman in her early 20's at worst? Another point on that is that the Covenant supposedly don't know just how valuable she is, if thats the case then why did the capture her to begin with? To continue on with Dr. Halsey, she seems to be flirty as hell with 117 and uses one of Cortana's signature lines. This episode was just terrible in story line and was worthy of, like most of the other episodes, at most being a Saturday morning cartoon.",1268956800,4,2481,4.338362068965517
4006788,5,B002WCLG3Y,If you like me are still a believer that there will one-day be a Peter Jackson produced Halo movie then you should buy this disc.  Halo Legends is a collection of animated short stories that cover a broad sampling of the Halo Universe.  the Stories are well written and the animation varied inn style and top notch.  It's not a the movie we are all still waiting for but it's a much need fix for us Halo junkies till then.,1268956800,,422,4.25
4006789,1,B002WCLG3Y,"I was really hopeful and as a typical dumb consumer I was sold by the cover and the game history. Right from the start, experience forewarned me that when I get overbearing music and amateurish simplistic graphics that I'm in for a big disappointment. That was reinforced when I started to hear a never ending, line after line,  high school sophomore level cliche ridden dialogue. Example for a line: ""The galaxy is vast, it's wonders and beauty are almost unfathomable. But the galaxy also hides dark secrets."" Urghhhh! And, the topping on this miserable experience was a lack-of-story. In fact, more like a jumbled, doesn't make sense, lack-of-story. The fact that Microsoft is involved in producing this movie explains part of the problem. Maybe it was put together by their high school game development school.",1268784000,3,814,5.029629629629629

That being said, I am not a fan of Anime at all. I did, however, enjoy this one. A couple of the stories are very good and the art is well done. The others are good fun, but the one episode with the over-the-top story and art starring Spartan 1337 is horrible. You have to take this one as what it is - a spoof episode.

As someone who has read all the Halo books, I thoroughly enjoyed the disk. I could have done without Odd Man Out. Not really my style, but there were some interesting concepts in it. For me Origins I & II alone make this worth buying and the CGI for the Package was amazing!! I wish they would release movies like this.

My hope is there will be 30 - 60 minute movies released that follow Halo canon. A good start would be with some of the books that have been written. If you're a fan of Halo, you should be reading the books.",1268524800,,685,4.229007633587786

4006796,5,B002WCLG3Y,"I'm an anime fan, and I also like 1st person shooters, and I have to say this DVD is an excellent entry-level journey into the world of HALO.

  The episodes are well rendered, with specific artwork made for the particular storyline.
  The episodes PROTOTYPE and THE PACKAGE are (imho) two of the best on the disc.
  The all-CGI episode THE PACKAGE is a nonstop rollercoaster ride! It reminds me of that half-hour CGI show: Starship Troopers: Roughnecks...only more ""gritty"", and with a lot better weaponry!
  That's not to say the rest of the episodes are not as good.
  ALL the stories portray (somewhat graphically) what warfare is usually all about...
  (and not all of it ends happily)
  The episode ODD ONE OUT is a bit on the lighter side...more like the ""WHY ME?"" or MURPHY'S LAW aspect (what CAN go wrong, WILL go wrong) to being a Spartan soldier.

  I admit to being a ""newbie"" when it comes to HALO, and the first TWO episodes (Origins I & II) give any viewer who's least bit curious about this ""universe"" a great ""heads-up"" as to what is going on and what everything is all about.
  I found the entire 2 part backstory very intriguing.

  Heck, I might even have to go get an X-BOX and take some REAL ""ops"" in this game!

  If you like good anime, you'll like this DVD.
  If you like HALO, this is right up your alley, and even if you just want to kick back and watch some good episodic story writing, this DVD has that, too.
  NOw...when are they coming out with a SECOND set of stories.

  Definitely, two (Spartan armor-clad) thumbs UP!
  And, it IS ""Master-Chief approved""!

4006797,4,B002WCLG3Y,"Halo Legends is a film that follows in the footsteps of the Batman: Gotham Knight film that was recently released.  It is a compilation of sub-stories created within an overall film, but with each sub-story or section being created by a different artist.  This can create a great viewing experience, seeing how it allows the viewer to see different artists' rendering of beloved characters such as Batman and Master Chief.  Did Halo Legends pull it off as well as Batman: Gotham Knight did?  Not really.  It had some excellent sections, while others left a lot to be desired.

Halo Legends is a compilation of seven short stories, created by various artists throughout the anime/cartoon world.  Some of these sections are done beautifully, truly resembling the anime that the original creator is associated with, but with a Halo twist thrown in.

-Origins: Origins is a great way to open up the film.  These sections talk about the Forerunners who originally fought off the Flood upon their initial invasion of the galaxy.  The Forerunners had no choice but to create a final resort weapon, known as Halo, that would wipe out the entire galaxy.  Before doing so, the Forerunners had collected data of specimens from the entire galaxy.  These specimen would multiply once the Flood was no longer in existence, allowing the galaxy to once again re-populate itself to its former state.

-The Duel: Produced by Mituhisa Ishikawa, best known for his work on the Ghost in the Shell films as well as Immortal Grand Prix, this section feels out of place.  The art style resembles a painting, except that it moves.  Whenever the visuals are stationary, this art style looks amazing, resembling something one may find in a museum.  However, upon each motion that the characters take, it feels ""awkward"" almost as if it shouldn't be moving at all.  This may be because the visuals appear fuzzy due to the design of the characters, making it difficult at times to view what is actually occurring.  This section follows the fight between the Arbiter and his fellow covenant, and the brutal slaying of his wife at the hands of an Elite.  This was all in an attempt to betray the Arbiter, all set up by one of the Prophets.

-Homecoming: Directed by Koji Sawai, best known for his work on anime titles such as Wolf's Rain and .Hack, this section follows the story of the process of Spartan creation.  The corporation responsible for the creation of Spartans, kidnapped children, cloned them, and put them through intense training, leaving them mentally scarred.  Upon escaping and returning home, one female Spartan finds out the truth about her creation and must find a way to cope with it.  Other Spartans who met their clones committed suicide, but the female protagonist is able to proceed with her missions, until the end of the story where she meets a grim fate in the midst of combat.

-Odd One Out: Created by Daisuke Nishio, animator for both Dragonball and Dragonball Z, this section feels exactly like these series as well.  It follows the tale of a Spartan dropped off on a planet left to fight a Covenant opponent on his own.  He gets the assistance from two human teenagers who are capable of flying, and pulling trees out of the ground, ala DBZ.  The Spartan even ditches his traditional heavy artillery guns in favor of hand to hand combat, all the while acting goofy, true to Dragonball fashion.  The enemy even at one point ""powers up"" reminiscent of Dragonball Z.  Daisuke truly added to Halo Legends what he is used to doing with anime.

-Prototype: Created by Shinji Aramaki, the character designer for series such as Gundam, the Prototype section feels exactly like a Gundam episode.  Utilizing giant Mechs, thrusters, and explosions associated with the Gundam series, Prototype is non-stop action.  It follows the tale of a commander of marine team, named Ghost.  Ghost received his nickname due to his constant lack of emotions.  He has been assigned with the responsibility of destroying the prototype mech suit.  He instead uses the suit to fight off the enemy Covenant long enough for his squad to retreat, before self destructing.  A great section, and my personal favorite of the entire film, possibly due to the fact that I am a huge Gundam fan.

-The Babysitter: Eiko Tanaka, creator of animes such as Beyond and Kiki's Deliver Service, was the lead producer on this segment.  It follows a team of Drop Shock Troopers who are assigned to kill a Prophet of the Covenant, from a distance of two miles away.  In order to assist with the assassination assignment, the team is lead by a Spartan.  The Spartan becomes side-tracked from the mission due to the constant screw ups of the Drop Shock Troopers, who constantly rely on the Spartan for saving.  Until the end, when the Spartan is attacked and must leave the assassination shot to one of the most arrogant of the Troopers.  Upon learning the truth about the Spartan, the whole squad quickly feels like they are to blame for its death.

-The Package: The Package is a fully 3D rendered segment that is visually stunning.  At times the story switches to a first person view, and it feels as if it is truly a videogame during these sections.  It follows Master Chief as he and his squadron try to rescue a scientist from the grasp of the Covenant.  Truly remarkable animation, and a nice balance of story and action make this a great segment.

Overall, the film has its ups and downs.  Sections such as The Package, The Prototype, and The Babysitter are top notch, adding enough action, story, and art style to truly satisfy fans.  However, sections such as The Duel feel too awkward and out of place.  It's interesting to see each segment and see how each artist throws in their own art style that utilize for their own shows for this film.  This gives each segment the personality to match its director/producer and add a layer of familiarity to each story.  An overall great film that is a must buy for fans of Halo, or fans of anime, such as myself.",1268352000,17,6018,4.7596525096525095

4006800,5,B002WCLG3Y,"There are some corny anime cliches here, but for the most part, it's a worthy addition to the Halo Universe.  The best segments are ""Origins 1"" and ""Origins 2"", where you get a vision of the Forerunners.  In the game they are supposed to be linked to humans, and here, although it's ambiguous what they looked like under their suits, you can still see that they may have been humanoid.  Prototype had some corny parts, but the action scenes were incredible.

I agree with another reviewer that an overplayed theme was the ""scacrifice mission"".  Irritated how some Spartans die stupid deaths.  While some Spartans are supposed to be 'expendable', for the most part, they're supposed pretty much unbeatable.  Like one of them said in the ""Halo Reach"" trailer, ""Spartans never die, they just go MIA""  Perhaps they should have more stories where it appears they die, but they're actually still alive, but you have no idea where they are or where they went.",1268092800,,952,4.7975460122699385

4006802,5,B002WCLG3Y,"I bougth this product just because I was curious, I really wanted to see how an animated production in the halo universe would look like, and I have to say that I am more than satisfied.  Why?  The stories where not Sierra 117 oriented, with the exception of one where he is part of a Spartan Team.  It was very interesting to see the japanese tweaks to the story that made it so interesting.

When you buy and watch this dvd set you have to keep in mind that you are not buying a game, or an anime based on Master Chief.  You have to keep in mind that he is only part of a huge universe with a very deep story that is worth watching.

I strongly suggest this dvd set for those interested to see how the halo universe was concieved and why the covenant and the UNSC where so brutal on their fights.  I ordered the two dvd set because DVD #2 has a documental sort of, that talks about the halo story so far and it was superb.

This is a great product worth to buy.  Kudos to the producers!",1268006400,,988,4.051546391752577
4006803,5,B002WCLG3Y,"I have played and beaten all of the Halo games except Halo Wars and not yet released Halo Reach. I have also read a few of the books and some of them are pretty good. So I figured I would give the anime a shot too. Man was I glad that I did.

It is actually split into seven episodes, though I would debate eight since Origins has two parts. So it is not one full length movie, but pieces that give you some history and honostly some where done for fun in my honost opinion.

Origins I and II were done by Studio 4 C (Tekkon Kinkreet) which gives you background story into Halo by telling you more about it's history than anything previously. The style of animation overall was good, but it moved very slowly for me and is while it will help people new to Halo understand Halo better, it offers more to strong Halo fans.

The Duel is about medievil time period of the Elites and is done by Production I.G. (Fooly Cooly ""FLCL"") and with Mamoru Oshii (director of Ghost in the Shell) which has a unique water color style with animation. It feels like Feudal Japan with aliens. I don't know how else to explain it other than that. It does move at a Ghost in the Shell style pace which once again is kind of slow, but really the story is quite interesting.

Homecoming is done by Production I.G. once again, but the style of animation is much more vivid. The story goes into the background of how Spartans were trained and kind of created in a sense. By far my favorite piece in Legends. It has a darker tone and has things to offer both fans of the story and people who just really enjoy anime.

Odd One Out is completely none canon so it doesn't offer much to Halo fans. It is meant to be more of a comedy piece. Done by Toei (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, One Piece, Hokuto no Ken ""Fist of the North Star"") with the animation style of Akira Toriyama this is most definitly geared towards anime fans. I really enjoyed the oddness of it, but if you don't like anime and you just want more story for Halo, you won't enjoy this one as much.

Prototype is done by Studio Bones (Fullmetal Alchemist, Xam'd: Lost Memories, Kurau Phantom Memory, Rahxephon) and is my second favorite piece in this collection. For those of you who know the Halo story well it has to do with The Cole Protocol which is the issue ordered to destroy any devices not yet completed and delete any information that could lead the covenant to Earth. A very dramatic story and quite enjoyable. The animation is great as well. Can be enjoyed by Halo fans and anime fans alike.

Babysitter is done by Studio 4 C once again. It has a slightly lighter tone to the artwork than Homecoming, but is very dark story wise. It follows the ODST and they get signed up with a Spartan. For those who are fans of the Halo story you can guess how they feel what sort of direction the story takes. It honostly was very predictable, but my third favorite piece. Really does well at driving the Halo story and also giving something to anime fans who are curious about the Halo universe outside the games.

The Package directed by Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed, Appleseed Ex Machina, Vexille) is a great piece for fans of Halo and uses computer graphics that make it feel much more like the games. The character artwork is anime style, but you won't really notice that much. Amazing to watch if you are a fan of Halo more than anime. It also says Master Chief's name in it for those of you who don't know his first name. You also see what a group of Spartans are capable of.

Now I tried to avoid spoilers so I just tried to explain more what to expect, so sorry that it's vague. I also was trying to show it from a point of view of someone who enjoys anime and is fairly familiar with the Halo universe.

Finally since I did this on the Blu-Ray version the reason I believe you should go with Blu-Ray. Honostly the art is amazing and the sound might only be 5.1 which is achievable through DVD it is fully uncompressed. To watch this in 1080p was a great experience. The anime groups, companies and directors that worked on this are masters of their field which really helped bring me in and while some of the pieces where slow, they weren't bad. I think it's worth owning even if you just love anime and if you like Halo this adds a lot to the overall story. I listed the names of all the episodes and the studios that worked on them for those who were curious. It is also in the extras which it has plenty of goodies for those who like them and one of the few Movies or rather ""OVA"" collection that I watched all of them. Honostly I hope you enjoy it as much as I did being a fan of anime and knowing the world of Halo.",1267747200,,4675,4.2604284103720405
4006804,4,B002WCLG3Y,I bought this shortly after its release and watched it first like normal and then turned on the commentary the second time around and watched the extras included on the bluray explaining stuff about the halo universe that even i had little or no clue about even tho i have played all the games pretty thorough. I enjoyed all the shorts honestly except for Origins 1 which had a motion comic type feel to it and i just didn't like the art style but that's personal opinion. The Duels art style would seem good on paper but it just sorta hurt my eyes at times but it also had a very nice effect at times as well but ultimately it didn't pan out for me. I liked them all overall but it could of been so much better and some of the stories won't make sense unless you have knowledge of the universe outside of the games. Overall its worth picking up if your a fan of Halo but if your not already this isn't going to change your mind.,1267574400,,929,4.166666666666667
4006805,4,B002WCLG3Y,"Halo Legends could best be described as ""canon filler"" to bridge the gap in several story lines as well as give some background information on several characters in the Halo Universe.  I consider myself a very big fan of the Halo Universe and feel that I would be a bit more critical on it than others due to this. I will do a review per episode (spoiler free) and fill any gaps as well as give a package review at the end.

Episode 1 & 2: Origins
Rating: 5 Stars
In the closing moments of Halo 3, Master Chief and Cortana find themselves alone on what remains of the ship ""Forward Unto Dawn"" with little hope of immediate rescue. Cortana begins a monologue that fills in thousand of years of history in the Halo Universe.  One thing the ""Origin"" episodes do very well is answer several questions (even to long time halo fans) about the origins of the races and species of the universe, as well as details on the Forerunner/Flood War, UNSC/Insurrectionist War, and The Human/Covenant War.  The art is very modern anime, vibrant color's (something i feel is important to Halo), and above average animation.  A must watch though just for the story.

Episode 3: The Duel
Rating: 4 Stars
The Dual is the history, origin and legend of the Sangheili (Elite) title of Arbiter.  The story takes place on ""Sanghelios"" the home world of the Arbiter.  The ""Covenant"" is moving across space looking to rally various species to it's cause promising them great things in return (The Great Journey).  Many of the Sangheili bend to the will of The Prophets and join the ""Covenant"" but the actions of the original Arbiter worry the Prophets, in return the Covenant hierarchy construct a plan to shame the title ""Arbiter"".  While the art style is modern CG Animation, the studio used a filter to give it a water color look.  While this was a decent approach and something different it seems too blurry at times all is not lost though as the story has a lot of emotion and one hell of a fight scene.

Episode 4: Homecoming
Rating: 4 Stars
First I can not dig to deep in this episode with out going in to spoilers. That being said Homecoming tells the story of the Spartan II solider Daisy-023.  This is more a story of the origin of the Spartan II's and how some of the candidates felt and what happened to when the children where conscripted at a young age without their parents knowing.  The story revolves around a small group of Spartan II's who wanted out of the program and the events that followed.

Episode 5: Odd One Out
Rating: 3 Stars
This being the only non-canon episode in Halo Legends, it tells the story of the Legendary Soldier - Spartan 1337 (leet speak for ""Elite"").  This comedic episode plays more to the tune of how absurdly powerful Spartans are depicted by ""fanboys"".  The episode is at times comic genius to those familiar with anime such as Naruto and Dragonball Z.  The Animation is average and the story is just fun and has a humorous cameo with Master Chief and Cortana.  The three star rating is based on that it offers nothing to the set as a whole nor is it considered canon in the universe.

Episode 6: The Baby Sitter
Rating: 4 Stars
""The Babysitter"" is about an small group of UNSC O.D.S.T. who are sent on a mission to eliminate a covenant threat and slow the progress of the alien armada.  The O.D.S.T's including Dutch (From Halo 3: ODST) discover they have been assigned a new team member for this mission, which happens to be a Spartan II named Cal-141.  The episodes real focus is on how the O.D.S.T. view Spartans before they understand them and how no matter the cost Spartan soldier will protect humanity at all cost.  The art is modern anime (along the lines of Samurai Champloo / Cowboy Bebop) great color though darker tones to represent the emotion of the story and great dialog between the characters.

Episode 7: The Package
Rating: 5 Stars
This is the one everyone needs to see.  The Covenant have intercepted a very important package to humanity and the UNSC decides to send Blue Team to recover it.  Spartan II's John-117 (Master Chief), Frederic-104, and Kelly-087 (also including Solomon-069 and Arthur-079) use booster frames to storm through the Covenant armada in space to find the Flagship of the fleet.  The episode is far to fun to spoil as you watch John-117 (Master Chief), Frederic-104, and Kelly-087 rush through waves of Covenant to secure the package.  The art work is modern CG Animation in the same vein of recent ""Appleseed"" animated movies, the only complaint is they did not use the english voice actor Steve Downes (Master Chiefs voice actor since Halo: combat Evolved).

Overall the multiple story lines and animation types keeps the overall package fresh and it is a must for any Halo fan out there who wants a little more story and less action.",1267488000,3,4801,4.615294117647059
4006806,3,B002WCLG3Y,"The first time I watched it I was completely unimpressed as both a halo fan and an anime fan, since a lot of things just felt like they didn't mesh, whether because of story fitting with existing cannon, visual/sound not matching up with existing visual/sound established by the game, or even just overall atmosphere (in the case of Odd Man Out, which is by FAR my least favorite).

After being encouraged to watch the commentary version done by Frank O'Connor and Joseph Chou, I caved in and gave it another go and learned the reasoning behind the choices that they made in production. I have to admit that knowing that information has made me rethink my original opinion about how involved in learning about halo the animation studios were during the whole process, but it still doesn't change how I felt about the movie as a whole.

Interesting concept with poor execution. 3/5.

Also in Homecoming I finally realized why the humans almost lost the war against the covenant. We obviously ran out of magic bullets that bend reality and make the elites shields not exist. I knew the original pistol was ridiculous, but one shot killing every elite is absurd.",1267315200,,1159,4.756218905472637
4006807,4,B002WCLG3Y,"Well, let me get this out of the way real quick.  I'm a PC gamer, so my exposure to the Halo universe has been dreadfully slow, but I still regard Halo: Combat Evolved as one of my favorite FPS games.  The mysterious environments, the badass weaponry, and some of the coolest characters in video game history all come to mind when I remember those first days playing the game.  I was quite excited when I heard that a Halo anime was going to be released.  After all, animation opens up so many possibilities for the direction of the Halo story to progress, but now that I've watched the whole DVD, I can't help feel somewhat disappointed.  Many of the stories just don't have the emotional pull I was hoping for.  The pieces are fairly short and you have to get used to a new animation style after every part, which isn't too bad, but some of them are animated in strange ways (a watercolor animation for example).  Let me leave off with a few more comments.

1.  The voice overs are not bad, but you do have the option of listening to the voice in Japanese or English.  Both are worth a listen.

2.  ""Odd One Out"" is intended to be a parody of the Halo universe.  I don't think some of you understood that and unfairly criticized it as something it wasn't.

3.  ORIGINS is by far, my favorite part of this collection(actually two parts).  Origins is the reason why this DVD will stay in my collection.  Cortana's sweeping narration and the effective animation of Studio 4C was amazing.  Part II was as much a story about humanity as it was Halo.  Although I appreciate the hard work that was put into the other parts, I wish that they where more like these segments.  Very impressive.

I'd recommend this DVD if you are looking for a light evening experience.  Don't expect to be moved to tears or experience some sort of epiphany, but try and enjoy these episodes for what they are.  Ya have some light comedy in there with ""Odd One Out"", unique animation with ""The Duel"", all around excellence with ""origins"", and a decent mix of action/lessons in morality in the rest of the episodes.  Not bad, but not great.  Make sure you get a good price.",1267228800,4,2146,4.441025641025641
4006808,1,B002WCLG3Y,"If Halo and Pokemon had a baby, that baby would be named Halo Legends. This is not a good thing, as it would be a very ugly, very stupid, cliche-ridden and nonsensical baby. I'm guessing that Microsoft and Bungie would be the greedy grandparents.

This is a situation where just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should.  And I'm perplexed as to why this was made the way it was anyway.  Japanese don't like/use X-box or Halo, Americans, aside from a niche fan base, don't embrace anime, so they put the two together and I guess come up with what you would expect.

Specifically, what makes Halo Legends so bad is that it was done so lazily.  Most of the animation is so very poor, people that actually play Halo can make better scenes from the theater in the game than what you can see in Halo Legends.  Also, the stories are filled with cliches, the dialog often doesn't even close to making sense, and there are numerous ripoffs of other films and games (Star Wars, Metroid, heck, even Jurassic Park).

You may find about 5 to 10 minutes of worthwhile material on this disc.  I am amazed that some people actually give this a four or a five in their reviews, because for the most part, this disc is unwatchable.  I would call into question the veracity of these reviews, but then again, Twilight is successful.

Oh, if only Peter Jackson didn't waste his time with the Lovely Bones and decided to make the Halo movie.",1267228800,2,1437,4.492307692307692
4006809,4,B002WCLG3Y,"A series of mini-stories about Halo.  Each one is surprisingly deep and thoughtful.  If you like anime/CG and Halo, you'll love this.",1267142400,,133,5.0
4006810,2,B002WCLG3Y,"Im giving this a 2-star rating not because I hate it, or think its worthless, but because I think it was less than average and did not live up to the standard set with Halo productions.

To begin with, I enjoyed Origins I & II and how they went back to cover the far history of the Haloverse.  Some things I wondered about the accuracy on, but comforted myself saying ""Frank O'Conner was here to look over everything so im sure everything holds with cannon"".  I believed this up until I noticed things like, they killed something like 8 or 9 Spartans over the course of the shows.  When you start out with only 75 to begin with, and almost all are accounted for, I believe they took liberties with the bodycount.  I will go back and look into it, and if im wrong i will revise and post that.  But then you had things like Spartan 23 and Spartan 1337, it doesnt mesh.  Not to mention (maybe entirely explained by its title) Odd One Out is almost a parody of all things Halo, dropping a Spartan on a planet of dinosaurs and kids and writing it as if its a Dragonball spin off.  After playing all the games (many times), reading the books, trying to fill in pieces that aren't cleary stated, (ive read all the 'marathon man' scripts in Halo 3 and such), I was hoping that at least one of these animated shorts would be more story driven and deep and revealing. Instead the majority of the stories were just about racking up the highest body count and having the most flashing lights.  Also little things like animating 50 foot tall hunters or 20 foot tall brutes was just absurd.

After taking the time to point all this out ill say that Im only covering its shortcomings because if you like Halo you will want to see it, and it doesnt have any outstanding ""awesome"" points to focus on.  Im not saying its horrible, just be prepared to be let down in several places while enjoying others.  I do hope this trend (and ill quote from one of the shows)  ""Less talking, More action!"" isn't the direction the franchise takes now that it has been moved over to Microsofts hands.  After watching the entire thing, I would still buy it again if I had it to, I just feel they could have done a much better job with the project.",1267142400,3,2214,4.329297820823244
4006811,2,B002WCLG3Y,"I like the idea of bringing Halo's side stories out on DVD. But why anime?! It just doesn't fit Halo at all. The episode ""The Package"" was ok. I didn't like how it went into first person sometimes during the action. Can we please get away from the fact it's based on a video game?! The story of Halo and all the side stories are great enough to stand alone. We don't need to bring in the first person action, or the multiplayer terminology. That is what made the live action movie of ""Doom"" such a flop. The ""Origin"" episodes were actually good too. Pretty informative. ""Babysitter"" and ""Prototype"" weren't too terrible, but the others were just awful and nothing like Halo. ""Odd One Out"" should just be deleted from the DVD. It's just goofy and typical Japanese anime and doesn't do anything to help Halo's stories.

I gave it 2 stars for ""Origins I and II"" and ""The Package"". Other than that, the others weren't worth the money and just plain terrible. Please guys, make a series or DVD that really showcases Halo's intricate stories and really brings the best out of Halo. Many of the Halo games' cinematic scenes are incredible. If they could make a animated or CGI series like those, that'd be ideal. They should have made all the episodes like ""Origins"" or ""The Package"". I, like many others, would have rather had that. But these anime shorts with different animation and directors just jumbles Halo around and doesn't really do anything for it. Japanese anime and Halo just don't mix. This did nothing to help the Halo universe.",1267142400,2,1536,4.626373626373627
4006812,3,B002WCLG3Y,"I was never a huge fan of the video games. Not because I didn't like them or because I don' t just love the stories (I do) but mainly because I didn't own an xbox when they first came out and I was never a part of the amazing social phenomenon that it's become. Until a few weeks back I wasn't aware that the story was so huge and epic, but now that I am I'm defiantly interested in finding out more. Well, I'm still waiting for my xbox to ship from home and I don't have ready access to a lot of books at the moment, so what then? Well, there's always Korean pirate DVD stores (yeah me!), you know, the place I bought EVERY episode of Battlestar Gallactica for just over fifty bucks (DVD quality too, HUA!). On my weekly DVD run a copy of Halo Legends caught my eye as I was walking out of the store and I thought to myself `hey, what better way to get more into Halo then to watch some anime based on it?' Anime based on a popular movie or comic has become a staple, from Animatrix, to the Batman anime, to the Hulk VS movies (still need to see those). These little episodic anime's have served other franchises well in the past.

Unfortunately Halo Legends doesn't quite live up to the story it was supposed to portray. Sure, there are moments of fun and cleverness, but through the whole thing I was just waiting to be blow away by at least ONE of the stories, and I kept on waiting until the very last episode was finished. I kept looking for a third disk or something. Nothing. That was it. There are good episodes in this little collection, a few decent ones, and a couple really, really bad ones. But nothing great, nothing that stands out and forces you to take notice.

The first two episodes, Origins, is nothing more than a retelling of the storyline behind the Halo universe, which is great for someone like me not totally immersed in the story from the games, but it surprised me how much I actually did know after all. There's nothing here that I didn't know from one place or another, nothing about the Forrunners, the Flood, the Covenant War, was new to me. If this is the case for me I can only imagine how boring and tiresome it would be for someone who's been following Halo since the very first game, though multiple books, games, etc. Unless you're a total Halo virgin Origins won't tell you anything  knew. Plus the animation in these episodes is... what's the word? Cheap. That's the best way I can describe it. It was cheap. Not a lot of movement, not a lot of frames, just a lot of still pictures without the usual amazing background art that makes anime so great.

Following these two episodes is `The Duel,' a story about the past of the Elites home world at the formation of their alliance with The Covenant. The main characters is apparently the Arbitrayer (sp?)of the time as he resists the alliance and fights for the independence of his race. Even without the terrible animation style this episode is done in it probably would have still been a pretty bad episode, but nothing else seems to matter when I can't even see what the hell is going on. It's done in some sort of water color style, don't know, I'm not an expert. But one does not need to be an expert to tell you that if you can't SEE what the hell is going on in a movie or TV show or whatever, then no matter what else it does right, that's the only that that is going to matter. How can I really appreciate the epic battle that takes place here if I can't SEE what the hell is going on? How can I sympathize for a character being unjustly tortured if I can't SEE her bruises and scares? If their just a bunch of lumps of indiscernible colors and shades then how can I saw I liked it?

The Homecoming is a little better than the previous two episodes, but once again it lacks that `wow' factor the games posses. Fortunately it's done in a more traditional style of animation so we can actually SEE the action going on. The story focuses on a Spartan other than Master Chief, who is stuck battling the Covenant on an unnamed Inner Colony with a squad of UNSC Marines. As they fight their way through a ruined city to get picked up by a Pelican and evacuated, we are treated to some back story on our Spartan, how she tried to escape the training center, how she was kidnapped and replaced by a clone so no one would know she was gone. It's not a bad story, but it suffers from a few common anime faults. Like when the episodes hero (the younger version) points a gun at her clone (who has no idea she's a clone) and the clone girl just smiles and says hi. Really? If your double ran up to you and pointed a gun in your face, are you just going to sit there and say hi? Why do anime characters always do this? Moving on.

Next we are treated to the abomination that is Odd One Out. Its dragon Ball Z and Halo neatly wrapped in one of the most absurdly idiotic anime's I've ever seen. Basically Master Chief is flying over an unknown world (for some reason) with another Spartan, #1337, who apparently despite his status as one of the world's greatest worriers has a habit of falling out the back of Pelicans in mid flight. As you might be able to tell from that alone, this isn't a serious episode. But it IS a stupid one. From ninja kids with super powers, to cavemen kids riding Dinosaurs, bumbling bad guys, full of themselves hero's, its basically a Saturday morning kids cartoon squished between a couple of drama/action based anime's. This episode really is the `odd one out' as it doesn't fit with any of the other episodes, and sucks a whole lot more then the worst of them.

Then there's `Prototype.' It starts like dozens of animes. The fragile girls voice dying while a strong male lead stands by trying to comfort her. Anyone here see `Now and Then, Here and There'? This anime starts pretty much how that one ends if that helps anyone (probably doesn't, most who read this probably have never seen the show I'm talking about; your loss). This, along with the next episode, is probably the best of the series. A lot of action to love, some interesting character development. The main character, `Ghost,' is a soldier dealing with the loss of his platoon at the beginning of the episode and his lost humanity. They call him Ghost because he doesn't feel anything, doesn't love anything, and according to a few soldiers in this show, doesn't show much regard for their lives. It figures there would have to be mechs in this series somewhere, it's a Japanese staple after all. Plus it does kind of fit Halo, doesn't it? The mech in this episode looks a lot like a Spartan but packs a lot more heat. Though it does get kind of cheesy and emo, it's still pretty good.

Next is `The Babysitter,' an episode about the badass ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Troopers) who jump into a planet with a Spartan (another blond hotty, apparently the Spartan program was full of them) to take out a Covenant prophet and document the `unknown alien ruins' of the planet. The reason I liked this one so much is the simple fact that it involves ODST, who other than the Spartans, are the biggest bad asses in the entire Halo universe. Sure, the Spartans are cool and all, but personally I prefer ODST troopers to the regular Halo hero.

And lastly, rounding out the list is `The Package,' pretty poorly done CGI episode where we get to see Spartans fight together and use some new fang space fighters. This one is nothing more than a `shoot em up' episode. The animation is pretty poor by today's standards, the action power ranger ish, the dialogue cheesy at best. Nothing special to report.

On a side note, I want to say I'm impressed with the Halo music, even if it was taken directly from the video games. Makes me want to go back and play the old ones (Halo 1 and 2) even more now.

So, is this a set worth owning? Only if you're a diehard Halo fan. If not, it's a rent at best.",1266883200,3,7863,4.3421768707482995
4006813,1,B002WCLG3Y,"I just got through watching this and honestly I am so upset I can't return it for a refund.  I started it last night but couldn't even make it half way through before I shut if off.  I forced myself to watch the second half expecting it to get better and well...it did, but barely.  As a little perspective from where I cam coming from; I have all but the original Halo game and I love the franchise so they really could have given me a mediocre product and I would have been happy.  However, this is just bad.
 My last purchase like this was Batman: Gotham Knight and I thought that it was an excellent product and was hoping this would be similar...wrong.

I will discuss each episode with NO spoilers so feel free to read on.

Origin I & II (Score 1.5/5):
 They are just a retelling of the Halo story thus far.  They were just a summary and at first I thought I was watching the special feature Halo: The Story So Far which Origin I & II were except they missed some pretty big points.  I agree with another poster that many of creators clearly have never played or knew very much about Halo.  The story also contained a ridiculous amount of forced melancholy.

The Duel (Score 0/5):
 This is one of the worst things I have ever watched.  O.K. the animation style was annoying but they tried something original and I will give them credit for that...Yes, even with the credit for the animation they only got a zero.  Without it they would have gotten negative points.  This story could not have been ""phoned in"" any more.  It could not have been more unoriginal or derivative (but not in a good way) and could not have been more stereotypical of a ""Eastern"" inspired production.  Take every single annoying Asian story stereotype put them together with some blurry water colors and you have ""The Duel.""  This was stereotypical even down to the giggling female character.  Why was she giggling?  The scene didn't even call for it.  If I was more P.C. I would say it was even insulting. Believe me this is not a spoiler.

Homecoming (Score 2/5)
 This was typical Japanese anime; some cool action but poorly written, over-the-top, untouching, emotional scenes that really were lacked any verisimilitude.

Odd Man Out (Score 0.5/5):
 If you liked DragonBallz you may like this but I doubt it.  This was written for VERY young children.  There was a Tyrannosaurus Rex in this...seriously need I say any more?

Prototype (Score 2.5/5)
 This could have been good.  It started well and was getting some emotion and attachment until...another walking Japanese stereotype.  Completely ridiculous in the Halo story line.  Hey if the UNSC can make those how are they losing this war?

The Babysitter (Score 3.4/5)
 This also started off well and was o.k.  If all of the stories were like this I would not have considered the purchase a total waste.  The problem here is that they eluded to some problems between the ODST and Spartans but never do anything with it.  The best thing that I can say about this is that it really could have been MUCH better which means it had a lot of unrealized potential which is still better than anything previous.

The Package (Score 3.75/5)
 Clearly, the artist that knew Halo the best.  The shots inside the helmets of the Spartans were really well done and this does the best job of making you feel like you are in the game.  They had problems with animating characters' lips during speaking but that isn't really an issue with the Spartans (because of their helmets) that have most of the screen time.  The story was nothing special and you really did not feel any loss.  Still the best of the bunch and a good outing for a straight to DVD production.  This story did not have the potential that Babysitter had but it got closer to realizing its potential.",1266796800,9,3785,4.566964285714286
4006814,5,B002WCLG3Y,"I just finished watching it tonight. I was simply amazed just by how well that it was done.

4006815,4,B002WCLG3Y,"To be honest, I was not hoping for much from HALO Legends. I am a fan of the game and all, but I am not obsessed with it. I found the stories to be rather interesting and entertaining, but not ground breaking or otherwise remarkable. The artwork for all of the stories were pretty average, except for ""the Duel"" which I found to be very imaginative and unique. As for the rest of the stories, if you have seen any recent anime then you have seen the art styles from this movie. Overall I am no disappointed that I bought the movie, and it was good for an hour or so diversion, but like I said it was not ground breaking to me. If you are a fan of the games, a sci-fi fan, an anime fan, or a little curious about the HALO mythology then I would have to recommend it.",1266710400,,765,4.0394736842105265
4006816,1,B002WCLG3Y,"Just got through watching the entire disc from beginning to end.  As my title indicates, this is a terrible animation addition to the Halo universe.  Just watching the stories from beginning to end was challenging enough.  After every episodic disappointment, I continued onwards to the next in hopes of some sort of redemption.  This is only the 2nd animation addition I've ever owned (The Matrix animated series was the 1st) and I have to say... either Matrix made an unbeatable companion series or Halo Legends is just straight disappointment.  Having watched anime for the better part of my entire life, I'll defer to the disappointment option.

I don't know what to say, really.  This is Halo for crying out loud.  Soldiers, aliens, space, and bugs.  How much more open can you get?  How difficult is it to make a couple of good animated episodes?  I'm not going to complain too much about the voice acting (although that was pretty terrible too) since it was clearly made for Japanese.  However, the stories and animation themselves were so poor that I wondered if there was any oversight of this production.  I honestly cannot believe I did not find a single episode I would watch again.  Batting a .000 is pretty amazing now-a-days when there is so much creativity out there coupled with an unbelieveably strong Halo market.  Disappointing, indeed.

Save your money and your disappointment.  You would find better creativity in playing Halo online and making up dialog after watching your recorded moments.",1266710400,4,1514,4.968127490039841
4006817,3,B002WCLG3Y,"First off let me say,if you're a hardcore or even a not so hardcore halo fan  this is a must for your collection.
 But for the most part I was left with a luke warm feeling for this dvd. Like a previous poster said The  two origin stories... gold. I believe it was well drawn, animated, and the story, excellent.  Prototype, and the Package also are excellent in it self. I watched those  three a few times already. Now the rest like I said- left me with en Eh feeling. The dual  despite a unique animation style, whhich impressed me., I felt the director took too many creative liberites and strayed away from  halo universe, and for most westerners, the setting, may seem a little to forgein.  The babysister, awesome story, I was glad to see the realtionship between Spartans and Odsts- but I was disappointed with the effort put into the animation. Odd man out, very funny, I chuckled a few time but to cliche for my taste. this style should be saved for something like DBZ and not halo. Lastly
Homecoming. This story should have been omitted from the dvd- personally I did not like it all. Poor animation, soft story line, disappointing over all.
 I am a halo fan If I  had the chance to buy this again I would, but overall I feel that this Dvd was rushed and could have been better",1266710400,,1287,4.3924050632911396

4006820,3,B002WCLG3Y,"A collection of 8 animated tales set within the Halo universe, Halo Legends offers plenty of interesting material and enjoyable action, which should be plenty enough for die hard Halo fans to dig.  For others though, not so much.  Crafted by some of the top anime creators in the business, Halo Legends' biggest flaw is that the whole affair just feels disjointed, and to put it bluntly, is just underwhelming.  However, boasting some nice production values, Halo Legends delivers in terms of its action content (which isn't nearly as violent as the video games that it has been adapted from) and voice acting, but in the end, doesn't flesh out any more of the Halo universe that one doesn't already know.  All in all, if you're a Halo fan, by all means check out Halo Legends, but if you aren't, then don't even bother.",1266537600,,820,4.673611111111111

4006822,2,B002WCLG3Y,"I think the sheer newness of this film has people blinded to the fact that it was not that good. I am fantasy and Manga artist and I am more than in agreement with artistic license, but there was so much of that in this flick that it took away what could have been decent stories. The visuals where at times confusing and totally unnecessary. It was like it was done by students who were allowed to spread their wings with colors and abstract shapes. This is somewhat typical of true Japanese Manga. Just too darn much. If they focused on what the game truly portrays this would have been much better.

If you play the game religiously you will be a bit disappointed in this looooong awaited movie.",1266451200,5,698,4.410852713178294
4006823,4,B002WCLG3Y,"A lot of times when dvd's (or now bd's) are made of a franchise, it is usually so canonized that if you are not a hardcore player, you won't understand the movie.  Or, it is so out there that the hardcore fans destroy it.  This is not one of those.  They have taken an idea that was used very successfully (Batman: Gotham Knights) and made it there own.  If you are not a hardcore fan, have not read any of the books, etc..., watch the special feature Up Till Now.  It gives a great background of everything.  My wife is not a gamer, but she loves Red vs. Blue.  My son is a hardcore Halo player.  I am a casual one.  The background was great for the wife and I.  Without it I think she would have been bored and lost after the first couple of episodes.  You have a variety of animation styles for the different chapters.  The beginning reminded me a lot of Heavy Metal.  There is one in there that is so DBZ.  My wife fell in love with Spartan 1337.  There is a good CG episode and then your standard animation.  The episode 'The Duel' is done in one that I have never seen before.  Quite good.  I gave it a 4 because halfway through it I was really getting depressed.  I spent 8 years in the Corps and have seen my share.  The director did a swell job inserting Spartan 1337's episode at the right time.  It was the light in the middle of the darkness.  This movie was very well done and I did not mind spending the extra for the BD version.  I would love to see a live version based on that ODST trailer.  Maybe one day.

4006824,4,B002WCLG3Y,"Bottom Line: This is a pretty good Anime title, even if you don't know anything about Halo.

This DVD anthology centers around the Halo Universe, the first two films serving as a Halo primer of sorts, laying out the entire story line. The animation is very good, my favorite short story is the third one, called Duel, which is told from the alien's point of view. ""Be Human"" is probably the second best story of the bunch, about a marine's crisis of conscience during a heavy battle.

All in all, there will be something in this DVD for everybody. I'm a big anime fan, so the style of animation used in these films is a plus for me. Time and effort was spent to make these short films and it shows.

4006826,2,B002WCLG3Y,"Halo Legends is basically Halo: The Animatrix, and comparisons are even made during the commentary. Like The Animatrix, it generally places visuals over everything else. It's also likewise very on/off, ranging from big-budget action to intimate character portraits. It's not a bad product, but it is something where you can't help but think what could have been. This review is from the perspective of a longtime fan, and really this product is not a good piece for non-fans anyway, so I'll be speaking in fan terms. Part-by-part, not necessarily in the same order as the disc, minor spoilers ahead:

-Origins I&II is solid. The storyline is essentially a recap of known history, told by the Cortana, although she freely admits much of what you'll see is speculation. The story starts from the Forerunner war with the Flood and covers through ""present day"", at the end of Halo 3. The drawing is okay, the animation very stiff, and Cortana's stand-in voice actress is not up to the original, but it's a compelling story. The canon is mostly kept, although as Cortana noted, you can't take the whole piece literally. 4/5

-The Duel has awful art, little story, and is mostly just noir. Ancient Elites, who apparently lived in feudal Japan and had two jaws instead of four, wind up in a duel. And one of them is in samurai armor. Lots of people wind up saying the art grew on them, but I just can't watch it. I can't help but wonder if the graphics didn't come out well during development, so the team got embarrassed and slapped on a dirty filter so you wouldn't notice. 1/5

-Homecoming shoots the Halo canon in the face at multiple junctions, and is another character vignette with some action slapped on. The lead female is a (teen, blonde, angsty) Spartan who for some reason wears her hair long in the helmet, and pulls off her helmet in a war zone in front of regular soldiers. This is just a massive no-no, for so many reasons. The story is basically a small remembrance underlying the action, i.e. not substantial. Still, the animation is great. 2/5

-Sort of big spoiler ahead: The Babysitter features the long flowing blonde hair of another Spartan lady. And the Elites are back in feudal Japan again. And a Spartan is listed as KIA. But there's at least a tie-in as Dutch from ODST makes an appearance. The story revolves around an assassination mission targeting a prophet, with some great action. The blonde female Spartan idea works a little better here, as it's given more context and saved up for the last act, but it's still a very artistic choice that you can't think too much about before it falls apart. 3/5

-Be Human is another character vignette plus action. The action here is really great, and the animation is excellent. The story revolves around a guy trying to regain his lost humanity during war, and frankly this bit is ham-handed. It all wraps up well though, with a great allusion to other events in the Halo universe. 4/5

-The Package is a ton of top-notch CGI. However, the voice acting is mostly awful, and the canon is terrible. The CGI during the central battle is amazing and well worth watching. 3/5

-Odd One out is basically a Halo version of Dragon Ball Z. It's supposed to be funny, I think. Spartan 1337 (har-har) gets eaten by a dinosaur and spit out at one point (pardon if I guffaw for a bit). It's mostly dumb, and I found it hard to watch. Some story is thrown over the framework, but it's like trying to build a house on a Jell-O foundation. 1/5

Too much of the disc is made up of what are basically character vignettes. The Duel is about that era's arbiter. Odd One out is about Spartan-Goku. Be Human is about, uh, that guy. Homecoming is about that girl. You can even extend it and say the whole disc is basically a series of vignettes. Origins features Cortana's reflections after Halo 3, The Babysitter is about the revelation regarding the Spartan, and The Package revolves around one great moment of Spartans fighting together. That makes the great failing of this work, that it just never branches out. It's one character and their take on some aspect of the Halo universe, again and again.

You can currently download all of these episodes online, and honestly I have to say you should save your money. The ""extra features"" include a trailer for Halo: Reach (available online), a DC comics trailer, and a director commentary that's one of the non good director commentaries. Frankie and crew basically recap known items and restate the plot of episodes over and over with little real insight. Oh, Origins is about conflict? Thanks. I didn't get that from the words ""conflict"" and ""war"" being used constantly in the dialog. If you're a massively hardcore fan, this is a decent piece to nerd out to. But I doubt even hardcore fans will give this more than one play, maybe two if you'r really nitpicking the content of Origins.",1266364800,29,4883,4.662020905923345
4006827,3,B002WCLG3Y,"I'll start by saying that I am a big and long time fan..  I've played all the games and own/read all the books.

I'm also a long time fan of Japanese Anime but mostly the more mature and original titles.

My favorite short was ""the package"" and the ""the duel"".  Although ""the duel"" was in a watercolor style it made up it's lack of graphic art with a interesting story line.  If judged on just these two I would give this nearly 5 stars.  Voice acting and action were great in them.  The stories were not corny or cheesy like the others.

""Origins 1 and 2"" were not great but still pleasant to watch just once.

The others were horrible..  They belong in the catagory with all the other generic cheap pumped out anime that seems so common in Japan.

Still worth it though and Walmart has this for the same price as well.",1266364800,4,820,4.259740259740259
4006828,2,B002WCLG3Y,"Some of it was okay, and I found the first 2 (origens and origens 2) interesting.  And there is some cool animation.  But overall the stories were arbitrary and gave me no connection to the central theme.  Some stories are just goofy (Spartan 1337? give me a break).  I really like the books and the games, but this either didn't translate well to anime, or the creators just didn't get what makes the story great.  If you're a fan of Halo it's hard to say not to buy it because there is SOME interesting stuff, but I can't see how this is good and I fully expect it to collect dust behind the rest of my watchable blu rays.  I was excited about this, even braved the snow and bad roads to go buy it.  Now I wish I would have just rented it.",1266278400,2,741,4.104166666666667
4006829,5,B002WCLG3Y,"First off the quality of this bluray is amazing.  It is masterfully done and deserves credit.  I ironically watched this on my PS3 and enjoyed every second of it.  Having very little experience with the Halo Franchise outside of a few hours on Halo 3 I was curious to the larger universe that the games were set in.  I know Bungie creates massively detailed worlds to set their games in and was curious as to what made Halo tick.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the story and the quality of the animation in this release.  The voice over work was excellent as well.

Here is my breakdown:

Voice Over:
Very well done, with great narration.
4.5/5

Animation:
Its great to see the various studios and artists create their impression of Halo.  The quality control is excellent as expected from a AAA title franchise.
5/5

Blu-Ray Extras:
Could have used more extras, maybe even a Halo Reach beta invitation code or something.  If there is one area that always could use improvement its extras!
4/5

Overall:
Well I would have given it a 4.5 out of 5 but that option is not available sadly.  I asked myself did I regret pre-ordering the blu-ray and how badly did I miss the extras.  To me personally I didn't think the lack of heavy duty extras called for a 80% score so I am giving it a full score.  This is something you will enjoy, its feature length and worth the watch.
5/5

4006830,5,B002WCLG3Y,"I'm going to try to give as spoiler-free of a review as possible.

I've been apprehensive of Halo Legends since it was announced, and was nervous with the crazy Japanese getting a hold of the franchise.  When a few stories were put up on Waypoint, however, my concerns were diminished.  Seeing that Frankie (Frank O'Connor) had control over what was being done in Legends, it led me to give credence to what I was once doubtful of.  And I've read all novels, blogs, BWUs, and played each game so much that there is little I don't know.

Yes, there are quivering eyes, men with jaws too wide open, cheesy mid-action posing shots, and a couple other cliched anime items that slipped in, but if you look past these and accept them as artistic interpretation, you can see what is underneath and really appreciate the stories.  Elite's losing a pair of mandibles and seeing a female elite in the context of 'the Duel' chuckling like a school girl was probably the worst moment of this entire DVD.  With that said, this has given me MORE food to chew on than sinking feelings of Microsoft milking us all out of $20.

-The entire episode of Origins (Part 1 & 2) are pure gold.  We get our first glimpse of Forerunners, and witness the true power of the Flood, not constricted by the hardware of the 360 and polygon counts.  And they are scary.  This is easily the best offering of the entire DVD, and all of Cortana's monologue was written by Frankie himself.  Great stuff.

-Babysitter, Prototype, and Homecoming all feature similar-styled animation and actually decent storylines.  There are a few canonical things that I am curious of, but I'm sure have explanations.  One thing I am getting tired of is all of the suicide missions that these side stories keep telling.  It's getting a little too predictable (same as in Halo Evolutions).

-The Duel is a tough one.  I hated the animation style when I first put it on, but as it went along, I saw what the artists were going for and really appreciated it.  A very dark tone was needed, and this conveyed it perfectly.  Two things to note: elites without their top pair of mandibles in certain scenes is simply artistic interpretation, and the large hunters are entirely possible (as Frankie has said in response to this criticism).

-The Package is a unique one.  The visuals are amazing.  This is the first time we ever see Master Chief working with his Spartans as a team.  Highly disappointed that you witness some Spartans (the GREATEST military minds on the battlefield) die to some pretty stupid reasons.  Voice acting choice for the MC?  Terrible.  Overall very, very fun though.

-Odd One Out is just fun.  Watch it and enjoy it.  Reminds me of Dragonball Z, in a good way.

If you like Halo, buy it.  My fiance is somewhat interested in the Halo Universe, but this gives her a chance to really appreciate what the writers of the Halo Universe have made, and we both could appreciate it.",1266278400,74,2941,4.617760617760617
4006831,5,B002WCLG3Y,"I can't give this any fewer than 5 stars in good conscience, because it's absolutely stunning, but for those who aren't familiar with Japanese animation you should know that the acting is abysmal (as it usually is when something gets only a half apt dub). The stories are great fun (nothing earth shattering) and it's a blast to watch... if you can get over the terrible, terrible, terrible, horrible, bad, no good English dub that is (your 8 year old brother could voice all of the characters, and it would only be marginally worse). The animation is stellar though, a real work of art, and will almost certainly distract you from the flaws.",1266278400,,642,4.6902654867256635
4006832,5,B002WCLG3Y,"This was a great take on the Halo Universe, and an awesome way to explore it a bit more.  There are several types of anime in here; some of which I like better than others.  That said, I rushed out and bought this the first day it came out (today), and I've watched the episodes on Halo Waypoint.  This makes my review 10 times more qualified than those of people giving negative reviews simply because they don't like the IDEA of what Halo Legends is.  Negative reviews of a concept have no place in a product review.",1266278400,11,518,4.309278350515464
4006833,5,B002WCLG3Y,"This is simply an 8 episode index of the history of the halo universe.
All episodes are not related and are showcasing a certain aspect of the Halo Universe. It's for the fans who want to see more of the Halo Galaxy outside of the Master Chief, even though he will appear in this Chronicle. All of the episodes have a different anime style and are made by different anime legends. This will be a very cool DVD to help build the Halo Lore.

I am so going to buy this DVD, though i do not know what is included in the Specai l edition yet.",1266192000,2,537,4.066037735849057

4006835,2,B002WCLG3Y,"Ok I am not a PS3 guy that hates Halo and everything xbox.  I LOVE Halo, I really do, I read all the books, even the bad ones.  I really don't mind that the stories don't fit with the books and games because lets face it even when they say its supposed to it doesn't ie. some Spartans survive reach in First Strike but I don't get what the point of the series of shorts was about.

The first 2 retellings of the whole Halo storyline was cool and sort of a nice touch for every stoner that went straight to the multiplayer or skipped the cut scenes but the rest of the shorts are just awful. The Duel storyline flat out takes too many liberties by getting rid of the elites split jaw and making them Japanese and boring.  The rest just hit every and I mean every anime clich in the book.  Even when there should be something cool about the short its ruined by hack unoriginal storytelling.  Prototype is a good example of this, a fun action oriented story ruined by an  intercutting story about a cold hearted guy having a heart to heart with a big softie who is a marine for some reason about him being ""human"" and this comes with loads and loads of quivering eye shots leading up to the predictable climax.  In other words if you've seen any anime you've seen this a dozen times, the only thing it was missing was a strained relationship with his father.

I am not against Anime there are loads of good anime and I'm not complaining about the quality of the visuals except for the short ""the package"" which was a sub standard CG that felt more like power rangers with the Spartans all posing and yelling ""lets go!"" minus that from a technical standpoint these are all well done but then Gili might have had the best lighting and sound of that year but it didn't help it.

Maybe it was just an experiment and they wanted to try something new but the whole thing really misses the mark for me.  It all feels like a knock off bought at a dollar store the writing just doesn't feel like a Halo story and leaves me feeling confused and unsatisfied.",1265760000,10,2044,4.283116883116883
