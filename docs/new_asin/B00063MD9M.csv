the survivor was the most expensive movie at the time filmed in australia.and with an international cast-still trying to come to grips with joseph cotton .it's a great piece of film history .all praise to the South Australian film corp-just remember ""shine"".
the dreaming is filmed on Kangaroo Island and with the atmosphere you can smell the seal poo.
though the movie's are not life threatening or have oscar in front of them they do play a great part in australian cinema
just ask quentin tarantino
check out the doco ""not quite hollywood "" and see what moves directors and filmakers do downunder

8037901,5,B00063MD9M,"Following nicely in the footsteps of vol. 1, this second aussie horror collection has 4 movies rather than 3. THE DREAMING- After an aboriginal tomb is opened, an archaeologist and his daughter (Penny Cook) begin having ghostly nightmares and visions. The daughter is led to solve a mystery involving the slaughter of an entire tribe by some sadistic whalers. The final, bloody minutes of this one pack most of the punch. VOYAGE INTO FEAR- A guilt-ridden woman is haunted by dreams and visions of her long-dead brother. She is convinced by her husband to travel to the scene of the accident where her parents and brother were killed. Along the way, their car gets stuck, hubby disappears, and a strange man comes along to ""help"". There's a sinister twist at the end! THE SURVIVOR- Robert Powell (Asylum) plays an airline pilot who is the only survivor of a plane crash that killed the rest of the 300 passengers and crew. He is joined by a psychic named Hobbs (An American Werewolf In London's Jenny Agutter) who assists him in finding out not how, but why he survived. The plot darkens as others are killed in a series of ""accidents"". It seems that the dead have returned, and they're very pi$$ed off! SNAPSHOT- Angela (Sigrid Thornton) is lured away from her hairdressing job and into the world of fashion, modeling, and advertising. A beautiful model named Madeline (Chantal Contouri from Thirst) introduces Angela to a group of endearing oddballs. All is well until some freak puts a slaughtered pig's head in Angela's bed! Things get weirder from this point. Someone is stalking the poor girl, but which nut is it? Could it be the overbearing mum? The clingy, pathetic ex-boyfriend? The photogragher who loves to take pictures of dead animals? Madeline's dirty-old-man husband? Or could it be Madeline herself? Watch and find out for yourself! Buy this collection now!...",1218931200,4,1876,4.90251572327044
