As far as I've heard and read them, the more complicated Japanese sentences they speak, the more incorrect the translations are apt to become. Though there are many great and wonderful translations in short sentences I am astonished at, through all the volumes released so far they contain too many mistranslations. Audio parts are not so bad but subtitles are horrible. I can't help even suspecting it is intentional.

I don't think the translation of this animation is supervised by any native Japanese speakers. If professionals translated like that without supervision, they don't have enough knowledge of Japanese and aren't qualified as professional.

It is so disappointing non-Japanese speakers can't understand the true wonderfulness of this anime. As a fan of Zipang, I even feel angry.",1179273600,2,966,5.069182389937107

He doesn't want anyone to be killed, simply scared, so he puts the Mirai's guided missle system to use, pinpointing in advance to the Americans what will be hit to demonstrate their powerlessness against their superior technology. While they sit in the shadows playing God, they may find themselves up against the harsher realities of war when they run into a platoon of American soldiers. Meanwhile Kusaka's real intentions begin to become clearer. While he accepts that Japan will lose the war, he wants them to lose with honor and do away with the unconditional surrender of his country and the shame that goes with it. He is steaming towards Guadalcanal with elements of the Imperial Navy to change history his own way.

This volume of Zipang was really good because up until now the crew of the Mirai haven't had to kill anyone. So they could sit in their comfortably advanced ship and make decisions about who should be saved and why. While they're contemplating their effects on history, they seem to forget that there's a real war going on with real people getting killed. The writers really stuck the noses of their chracters in it this installment. There are some really intense moments reminescent of Saving Private Ryan with its sometimes intimate portrayal of death. Another cool thing about Zipang is that you never know the true motivations of all the characters which makes it more realistic. Good show.",1178496000,,1642,4.8021201413427566
