If you enjoyed these movies, there are ""Lunar Edition"" releases of both that contain a lot of cool extras.",1451001600,,201,4.4324324324324325

8274410,5,B000B4179S,"If you love low-budget/no budget cheese filled horror, then these movies will do you justice! If you are looking for Hollywood style big named actors and such, then you need to search under ""Micheal Bay"" or ""Christopher Nolan"" to see if they can meet what you are looking for. If you want fun and gore, you need to see these two movies. 'Dead and Rotting' is best (actually one of my all time favorite movies), but 'Stitches' is still worth the watch. Great stories and great work with what the creators had to film with.",1304294400,2,521,4.494736842105263
