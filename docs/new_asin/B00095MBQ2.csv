2266690,4,B00095MBQ2,"I've been looking for my first bellydance workout dvd for sometime (why wouldn't I? Dancing sexy to sexy music is alot more fun that breaking my neck doing crunches on the floor), I'm incredibly cheap with my money and wanted to make sure I picked the right one that would help tone me up and one where I would like the pacing and the music as well. I would place myself at an intermediate beginner.

I know alot of the basic bellydance movements but lack the experience. I also would put myself no really ""In-shape"" but not really out of shape either, I'm somewhere inbetween.

I have mixed feelings on this one, leaning toward really liking. I think the music's okay, could've been a little more, I don't know, up-tempo? But seeing as I am a beginner it's probably for the best.

Somethings I liked:
-First off, I enjoyed Irina's attitude, she was there to teach you bellydance and get you into shape. No idle chitchat, no preaching on any belief or lifestyle that you should abide by. I also enjoyed the fact that she didn't repeatedly yell ""come on!"" and ""You can do it!"", it's incredibly annoying to me and doesn't motivate me whatsoever. I found it incredibly refreshing.
-During the upperbody workout my arms and abs were aching in the first 5 minutes, I'm taking that as a sign that if I continue doing this workout, I'll see some toning.
-The Lower Body one will sure work your thighs just from squeezing them from doing multiple hip lifts
-The Breakdown of the moves section. You chose one and they all play from the move on. I liked that I didn't have to select each one over and over to learn them.

Somethings I disliked:
-The Yoga Warmup, seeing as I have experience in yoga and I know that you need to warm up for practicing yoga itself, I don't know if I think this was a good way to start a video. I do know that alot of current workout dvds have them but come one? Sun salutations right off the bat? Swing your legs behind you and going from Downward Dog into a lunge can be pretty difficult at first
-Irina teaches the movements WAY TOO FAST even though the workouts themselves aren't fast.
-While this workout definately qualifies as toning, it isn't really cardio. The workouts while strenuous aren't exactly what I consider a good cardio workout (but seeing as I stand for 8 hours straight at work and run up and down stairs and sprinting across campus trying to get to class I'm not sure what cardio workout can really compare).

HOWEVER, All of my dislikes could be worked through. I'm going to keep using this DVD because I know once I do have the time to seriously buckle down and practive each move and do the workout repeatedly I will get past the fast-paced teaching. I suggest doing just the breakdown portion for your toning workout for the first few times before actually doing the workouts seeing as you aren't really taught the moves during the workout

WHO THIS WORKOUT IS FOR/CONCLUSION:
-Someone of a higher level of bellydance training or someone who has the time on their hands to go through the Basics Breakdown section.
-Someone who wants to tone their abs and arms, this'll will definately get you there if you do this regularly.

Feel free to comment letting me know if you have any other questions on my experiences with this DVD and if I do end up using this dvd regularly for a few months, I'll update on my progress and if I see any changes.",1287964800,8,3388,4.490259740259741
2266691,1,B00095MBQ2,"This is an absolutely terrible dvd.  While I think Irina very graceful and a great dancer, she lacks any ability as a teacher.  Most instructional DVD's show you a move, at least once or twice, break it down, and then show the move slowly and then half speed, tempo and double time.  Irina does absolutely NO instruction!  She shows the move as she is doing it...with voice over I might add.  Then the tempo picks up.  I have had at least 4 or 5 beginning belly dance classes, so while I am NO expert, I know the basic moves.  I found this very difficult to follow and keep up with.  I wish I could return it.  You could learn more on FitTV Shimmy.  I am going to ask my belly dance teacher for a recommendation because clearly these reviews didn't help!  Maggie",1287964800,13,762,4.295774647887324
2266692,5,B00095MBQ2,"This DVD is amazing,
it is my first experience learning combinations, and I love all the isolations!
Irina is extremely talented and I Really recommend this DVD for beginners, intermediates like me, and advanced dancers!",1286668800,2,220,5.314285714285714
2266693,5,B00095MBQ2,"Simply said, I love this program! For several weeks I have enjoyed working out to this beautiful and elegant ""Belly Dance Tribal Fusion Workout"" by Irina. Here is simplicity with big elegance which sets this workout apart from the overly popular styles out there.

Here is my viewpoint:
As a dance instructor, I appreciate a program that is rich in technique, appealing to all entry levels in all its contents and presentation, not too difficult to understand, interesting enough to keep one drawn in. I found all the above in this program. I won't clutter my review with lengthy words to describe every  isolation in detail but rather, I chose to place the emphasis on the quality of the end result of my experience. Since I love tribal style belly dance I applied these elements to my own style to create a ""less hard"" style of tribal dance. The end result is a graceful,soft, movement in a ""feminine"" tribal style that feels so lovely to dance to!

The Program-140 minutes of fantastic instruction with voice or music only options, easy to navigate menus are a great bonus to facilitate learning and following along to the following:

Warm-Up- yoga warm up section of this program is disciplined, get ready for downward facing dogs, planks, leg lunges (salutation)

Technique- RICH technique section begins with complete breakdown or tutorial of belly dance isolations to prepare the arms, shoulders, chest, hips with the many variations in range of motion used in tribal style.

Drill and Choreography-3 distinct drill sections target: upper body, and lower body and which are combined into a tribal choreography in smooth elements that remind me of Egyptian styles, uniquely blended.  This section combines progressive isolations for the arms, shoulders,  chest, hips, and undulations and also become a balanced workout indeed!

The collection of music in the workout includes some favorites from Moon Moth Mixes and Silk  Road. To finalize the program,  Irina presents such a lovely performance which backs up her great technique! I recommend this program to the tribal dancer who desires the perfect blend of tribal style and belly dance with less of a rough edge. Great presentation!",1283385600,9,2191,5.058333333333334
2266694,5,B00095MBQ2,"Irina Akulenko is one of the softest and most graceful tribal fusion dancers I've seen on video. Soft, because her moves are feminine and pretty rather than the hard and sometimes robotic moves that are used in tribal fusion. Graceful because she's beautiful to begin with and her ballet training gives her fantastic form. She has a very wide range of movement. She uses a lot of arm work - again, the pretty kind rather than the serpentine -- and she's expressive. Irina's dancing is also simpler rather than being gimmicky - and that's a total breath of fresh air.
When I saw the preview for the Bellydance Tribal Fusion Workout DVD, I couldn't wait for it be available. Somehow the moves she was using looked more accessible to a tribal fusion beginner. And while I may have done a bit of tribal fusion drilling, I haven't done so well with combinations or gone through an entire TF choreography. Well, except Arabian Spices. Irina's performance on her new DVD particularly won me over.

Mossy, young composer of the song used for Irina's choreography,  was quite blown away when he saw her performance. Not only was he amazed at her dancing, he thought she really danced his song, Retrying, as he felt it.  That's a great compliment to a dancer, wouldn't you say?
Well, finally I do have my copy of Tribal Fusion Workout. I've only worked with it a little yet, so this is a ""first look"".

A different format
Although many of the essentials such as tutorial of basics, warm up, cooldown, practice with and without music and cues, performance etc are in the familiar format seen on other World Dance videos, the main workout on this video follows a different arrangement.
Everything fits into three big chunks - upper body, lower body, total body. These three sections each comprise one meaty combination of four smaller mini combinations.
Irina begins by teaching one mini combination. For example, that could be a maya layered on some footwork and paired with a level change and takseem figure eight. This is explained and drilled a few times. She then moves on and adds another mini combination and drills that. And then she is joined by two other dancers and all three of them take it from the top. After this, we switch back to Irina on her own for the next two mini combinations, and again the three of them take it from the top. After four mini combos, the full or mega combination is over.
So that's the instruction pattern followed for each of the three segments: Learn mini 1, add mini 2, dance both. Add mini 3, add mini 4, dance whole combo. This is different from most other formats where you learn the moves in detail with no music and then practice a couple of times with music.
I have to admit I found myself getting a little confused at first. For anyone buying this video, I'd suggesting watching first to get familiar with the format.

Combinations
I really like the combinations Irina uses. As I said before, there are no gimmicks. And yet, these are challenging combinations because there's some layering right from the start. I've always been thoroughly challenged with multi tasking in belly dance and so I didn't find I could just barge in and ""do"" the workout. To give you an example of one bit of simple layering: you set up sharp side to side hips in a right left right right, left right left left pattern. And then you layer a set of arm movements over this pattern. Wrists in, wrists out, sweep up, sweep down, palms down...etc. Total beginners, have fun, because I know for sure I couldn't have done this a few years ago. However, if you're dancerly or have been dancing anyway and are just starting out with tribal fusion in particular, it should be just fine.
The combinations use a rich variety of movements, from mayas and undulations to piston hips to shimmies. There's plenty of footwork, level change (which you can modify) and arm work.

Beautiful arm work
In this program, you don't get to keep your arms still in table top or relaxed at your sides. Arm moves are very much a part of the combinations throughout. While I wouldn't call these overly busy arms, I would say there's constant arm movement - and that's a good thing, even if it is challenging.
The style is not Rachelesque. You don't resort to snake arms all through. Instead, you'll find you have to move the arms in large sweeps and presses and include a lot of wrist work. This is what makes the plainest most basic move very expressive. I would liken it to Sera's East Coast DVDs, perhaps, which also involves something beyond extreme snake arms.

Drills, workout or dance?
Now, here's where my opinion may differ from ohers. I don't find this a sweaty workout. Perhaps if you don't budge at all, but I'm comparing with actual fitness workouts, and I would not say that someone should buy this video to lose weight or sweat off the inches. Certainly, you get some toning, but that's true of all dance programs. It's only a workout if you use the term loosely.
Is it a set of drills? Not in the very repetitive sense. If you think of drills as something you'd find on Asharah, Ariellah, Sadie, or Michelle's videos, then this is not the same format. You have some repetitions, but not as much as you might want for drills. That said, from what I know of World Dance's approach to drills, they like to redefine them to have more variety and changes so that they're more fun to do. Speaking for myself, I like long repetitive drills, for some reason. When they are a few repetitions only, I think of them as combinations being practiced. Oh well, a matter of semantic preferences, perhaps.
Is it a dance? Definitely. And it cannot be otherwise. These are combos that can be considered standard to tribal fusion and you can very easily use them in your own improvisation and combinations.
Who is it for?
While it's easy enough to say it's for everyone, I'd say total beginners should not make this one of their first few purchases unless they're particularly keen on tribal fusion. For workouts, drills and basics, there are other options, including from WDNY. But if there's a particular attraction towards tribal fusion - as was the case with me - don't miss out on this.
 For advanced beginners who haven't done any tribal fusion dancing but would like a touch of it, this is a good option as it doesn't get into hardcore tribal. For advanced beginners who want to expand their tribal fusion repertoire, this is a good one. For more advanced dancers, I wouldn't presume to speak, but I'd say they could use it for a refresher and teaching ideas. Or just to plain enjoy nice combinations with a graceful dancer.
Overall, this is a pretty and enjoyable package. Not spectacular, but very nice and more to play with for tribal fusion enthusiasts.",1282435200,25,6748,4.626878130217029
2266695,5,B00095MBQ2,"What an enjoyable dvd from start to finish.  Even if you are a bellydance novice, like me, you will be dancing in no time.  You may not get all of isolations but you'll work up a good sweat trying.

The class starts with an energetic yoga warm-up that consists of sun salutations, seated twists, pigeon and mermaid side stretches. A note: Irina's feet are in first position during the salutes.  She is a dancer after all.  Be sure to put your feet in parallel first instead.

The rest of the class introduces islolations and then puts the moves together in a mini routine.  She does this for each upper body part.  At the end of the upper body section, she strings all of the moves together into a complete routine.  The same pattern continues for the lower body and the total body. You are constantly moving in this dvd, from arms to chest pops, undulations, mayas, shimmies to turns and foot patterns. The last routine is very layered.

I got most of it although I got lost on some of the chest isolations.  Irina is very good at cuing.  She uses repetition to teach and then is silent so that you can feel the movement with the music.

Who is this dvd for? Everyone. Even absolute bellydance beginners will enjoy this dvd.  Very nice and a welcomed addition to my growing bellydance library.",1282262400,9,1294,4.497854077253219
2266726,5,B00095MBQ2,"I like how she teaches the moves, but she does go a little fast. I will be getting her beginner belly dance dvd later on.",1452902400,,121,3.88
2266727,5,B00095MBQ2,Love this video from Irina! She is one of my favorite inspirational dancers! This video is great for learning new belly dance moves while also refreshing up on old one.,1448236800,2,168,4.633333333333334
2266728,3,B00095MBQ2,"The dvd says all levels, so I gave it three stars if you have no experience.  She is adorable and instruction is pretty clear for the most part.  However, I have many dvds, so I can confidently tell you not to buy this.  First, the yoga warm-up happening in belly dance dvds is not a good idea in my opinion.  A cold body probably shouldn't be doing backbends over and over :(  Anyhow, besides the warm-up, which is around 9 minutes but still boring; the isolations and smaller sections are just ok.  The combinations are short and strung together nicely for a beginner.  But since there are tons of dvds out there, if you want a taste of tribal, first opt for Rachel Brice's or even Elisheva over this one.  If you want a few more opinions on tribal dvds, please read on.
Fayzah is a great dancer, but more advanced and therefore does not break down her choreography like most others.
I was not a huge fan of Sera's East Coast Tribal dvd either because the warm-up is way too long and the choreography is ok, but again so many other to choose from.
Ariellah's Tribal Fusion is boring too, but she does a lot of drills that are great for a beginner.  I just hate the dvd b/c she is monotone and it's redundant.
Fluid Precision by Kassar is probably the top 3 worst belly dance dvds I have ever done.  Sadly, it is more big boobs and a pretty face than anything else.
Recap of my review for this Tribal Belly Dance with Irina....brand new people may like it because it's not that long when you do the entire thing, but anyone who has seen any other dvds....you will not learn anything new here and it's just boring :(  2 stars for me personally because I was looking to learn something new and this did not deliver.
P.S. If you have a couple of beginner dvds and just want a workout and not to learn much, a nice short non-tribal one is Jillina's Shape up N Hip out  :)",1447372800,4,1868,4.275568181818182
2266729,5,B00095MBQ2,"This dvd has a wonderful yoga warm up section which I highly recommend beginners use to help loosen the muscles before practice. There are several routines but if you stay where you need to focus on, you can use this dvd for a long time because she adds layers because they are actual routines.

2266730,5,B00095MBQ2,"Love it. I've bought other belly dance DVDs before, but this has been the best so far.

2266734,5,B00095MBQ2,This is a great instructional video. The layering technique she uses makes complicated choreography possible fur an intermediate learner.,1419897600,,137,6.2631578947368425
2266735,4,B00095MBQ2,"My rating is between a 3.5-4 stars as of now. Just because I find some of the moves difficult and Im an intermediate dancer. Don't get me wrong, I love Irina and her particular style of dance fascinates me. I fell in love with her dance when I came across her howto videos on YT. I later searched for her and found her actual performances. Completely in awe. I learned that she had some instructional DVDs and decided to go for this one. If your looking for a tribal fusion 101 I suggest you go for something else. This is a workout video so she goes over the steps quickly. It's not so much that the moves/isolations are difficult for me, because Ive always been a natural and Ive mastered the basic steps. It's the layering, the tempo of the instruction.

Fusion workout: what it actually is
Irina from the beginning of the step instruction is basically going over the isolations and then layering the body isolations with arm movements and lower body shimmies. Throughout the video she teaches you short choreographed layerings and throughout the video has you dance the whole portion you have learned. She's basically teaching you a whole dance choreography by the end. If you have seen her howto videos on YT then you'd have a basic insight into how she does this. It's simple and not that difficult, except it's extremely fast paced and only spends a couple minutes teaching you the dance moves.

My problem with this DVD: too fast paced for me. I thought this was going to be an instructional Fusion DVD. While I don't regret purchasing it. I do wish it would have been an instructional DVD as I thought and misread thd description.

Final thoughts: I don't regret purchasing like Ive said before. This DVD is a great way to exercise and learn a choreography. Although fast paced, I will learn new layering moves that haven't thought of before, so thats good.

Who its for: people who have somw basic knowlesge of Belly Dance or Raqs Sharqi. Dont purchase thinking you'll learn Tribal Fusion as it's a workout but I also don't want to be discourages by purchasing it as Irina is an excellent dancer and teacher. Give it a try but after you've learn some BD.",1417132800,4,2164,4.583979328165374

2266758,5,B00095MBQ2,"I finally got my copy today! After reviewing this dvd, I am greatly pleased that my money was well spent! The workout is just perfect for me! This workout can be for beginners if they review the material first, assuming they know the basic steps. Irina is one of the best instructors I've watched as she explains and demonstrates the moves in a way that's easy to grasp. In some places she goes a little fast, but that's why there's a ""PAUSE"" button.
There's a short warm-up and cool down section, which I prefer since I do my pre dance exercises to Tribal Fusion - Yoga Isolations & Drills for Bellydance with Rachel Brice,
 and another yoga warm-up with Sharon Kihara. Irina spends a majority of the video on teaching dance combos and layering, which is what I need to focus on.
Her performance at the end is, of course, Awesome!

The video consists of a yoga warm up, three sets of drills and combinations and a beautiful performance by Irina. There is also a technique breakdown and opportunity to learn layering.

IF YOU ARE A ABSOLUTE BEGINNER, BELLYDANCE BASICS AND BEYOND WITH JENNA, IN ADDITION TO SADIE'S COMPLETE BELLYDANCE GUIDE provide step by step instruction in front of mirrors with no voice overs if that is your preference. I also recommend Love Potion from Worldance New York with Blanca, Neon, and Sarah Skinner.

I always watch the videos in their entirety to catch nuisances and increase my lyrical ability. You will find that Irina's fluidity and control is BEAUTIFUL and she has become one of my favs!

2266797,5,B00095MBQ2,"WHAT MAKES THIS DVD SPECIAL - Irina uses a similar learning/drilling method than Rachel Brice in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpentine-Belly-Dance-with-Rachel-Brice-Bellydance-Technique-Yoga-for-Strong-Relaxed-Sinuous-Movement/dp/B00095NX9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpentine - Belly Dance with Rachel Brice :: Bellydance Technique & Yoga for Strong, Relaxed & Sinuous Movement</a>. The combinations are layered almost from the beginning (some are really difficult, since Irina asks you for example to make ""staccato movements"" with your upper body while your arms should flow smoothly and not follow the staccato rythm). If you are a beginner you can stay with the main isolation that is being drilled, whereas if you are more advanced, you can try to layer the steps/arms combinations to it. This can be quite challenging, since it is difficult to ignore the other movements and just stick for example to your chest circle and not move your feet, so you feel you cannot follow. But at some point you manage to stick to one movement and at some next point and without really noticing it, you will add the feet in one combination (some moves are quite intuitive, so you get into the steps gradually and at your own pace). For example you can leave out the hip shimmies that accompany some footwork or undulation; your dance may not look as ""rounded"", but simple steps performed elegantly and with precision also look good. This method allows you to ""grow"" with the DVD, so you can use it for a long time period as your skills improve. If you are a total beginner, you can stick to drilling the moves in the break down section; since the drills are done with music it is also fun.

This DVD is totally different from her newer DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diamond-Cut-Bellydance-Precision-Technique-Practice-for-Beginners-with-Irina-Akulenko-2-DVD-Set-belly-dance/dp/B00EZ6FXHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diamond Cut Bellydance: Precision Technique & Practice for Beginners with Irina Akulenko 2-DVD Set - belly dance</a>, since the latter is not a dance workout, where you are immediately immersed in a kind of workout choreography and where you start layering movements from the beginning. Instead you drill a lot of individual moves without layering to music, which is easier for beginners; then, instead of combinations in a workout format, where you repeat the same move several times in each combination, you will find smaller pieces of dance flows without repeating movements inside them. The last dance flow is a full drum solo choreography, which is way more difficult for beginners than this workout. So basically you can grow your dance with both DVD's. Both DVD's share Irina's beautiful, elegant and gracious style, her emphasis on drilling, her sassy combinations that are modern and classic at the same time and the care with which she selects the music.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low, only the third segment increases your heart rate to medium TONING: Medium CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Advanced Beginner to Advanced Intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very good MUSIC: Very good FUN FACTOR: High

CONTENT:
1) Yoga warm-up, the first time I did this session it seemed too quick for me (this warm-up brings your heart rate up a bit) and also a bit risky for your knees. The following times it was much better and now I really like it (still risky, so take care of how you position your knees in the lunges section - even if it takes you longer to put yourself into the pose - Irina can allow herself to do it quickly, I cannot).
2) Break down - Perfect speed practice with music of the steps & moves needed in the workout but each on its own and without footwork or shimmy layerings. You can play it in its entirety or choose each move from a menu to drill it separately. This segment can be used in three ways: As a warm-up, instead of the yoga warm-up, as a tutorial for the moves and as an independent drilling section.
3) Workout: It is more like three dance combos. The first one is  Upper body, the second is Lower body and the third is Total body (upper and lower body coordination moves). Each combo consists of moves that are drilled independently and then ""from the top"", adding the previous moves from the segment. This method allows you to add each new step to the ones you've already learned until you know the full choreography. The third one is a bit more complicated than the first two (more layering, more accents and a bit more cardio), so if you are a beginner stick to the first two. This last one is specially effective for abs, I did not notice it at the moment but when I finished my upper abs were burning, but with a very strange sensation, from the inside out.
4) Cool-down - short but very effective standing cool-down stretches
5) Performance - Although it is a complete performance, it incorporates many of the moves drilled in this DVD, but performed in such a way that it motivates you to keep on drilling. How beautiful simplicity looks!

MUSIC:
Very good choice, modern instrumental music that is nice to dance to.

EMPHASIS:
Good overall emphasis, upper body, lower body, total body (including abs) and nice head & arm movements too.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD's:
+ Yoga warm-up and cooldown: I like that they are not too long so I use them even with other workouts
+ Dance combinations and good music: the dance looks elegant and graceful and is not too complicated
+ FUN: You drill while dancing, so it's more fun than a ""workout"", but the format of adding on the previous segment and then ""from the top"" allows for a good drilling session. This is a real dance workout, since you drill to a full choreography, not just to small combinations that are performed with music. I found&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foundations-of-Bellydance-East-Coast-Tribal-Beginner-Tribal-Fusion-Bellydance/dp/B00095VJTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foundations of Bellydance: East Coast Tribal - Beginner Tribal Fusion Bellydance</a>&nbsp;to be similar in this respect, but with Irina you drill aiming precision, while with Sera it's more about the flow that bring the moves together.
+ Abs drills: The last segment contains excellent abs drills, my abs were burning like after an abs-crunch session, but while dancing...
+ You can grow with the DVD as you improve your skills",1341187200,13,6450,5.2684824902723735
2266798,5,B00095MBQ2,"The first reviewer really covered this DVD very well. So not too much to add. This is a great intoduction to a slightly different take on the Tribal Fusion style. Irina still keeps the distinct articulation & flair of Tribal Fusion, yet with a graceful, softer edge.

I agree that the DVD really borders somewhere in-between a workout & learning a dance. As I progressed through it, I did break a sweat. You learn alot of nice combinations that are fun to do while you work & condition the whole body. It does have a Warm-up (Yoga Sun salutations) & Cool down (nice-but very short). But it is not a high intensity cardio workout, if that is what you are looking for.

She does a nice job of demonstrating the movements in the ""basics"" section. But know the breakdowns are not covered in-depth. She quicky goes over it once and then you repeat the movement a few times, then move on. Also there is no coverage of basic dance posture. A true beginner might feel lost with this.

In the Upper, Lower & Total Body sections, she assumes you already know the movements, she only breaks down the combination. There are about 5 combinations taught in each section, and as each section progresses, the combinations become more advanced. The combinations are interesting and fun to learn, with plenty of footwork, turns, and some layering.

I really enjoyed working with this DVD. Though I am not a ""tribal"" dancer, I admire the style & enjoy incorporating aspects of it into my dance. Up until now, I hadn't been able to figure out how to bring that ""tribal"" flair to my dance because I lean towards a more 'ballet"" style arm when I bellydance. Also I liked the more earthy, heavy drum based, Middle Eastern style music used on the DVD. It really gets you going and is fun to listen to as you dance. It's not the electronic mix music (sounds like a computer burping) sometimes used in Tribal Fusion.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes bellydance, as well as, the bellydancer that likes to incoporate dance styles or is interested in trying something new. For the more advanced beginner to intermediate.",1333065600,3,2106,4.620320855614973
2266799,4,B00095MBQ2,"OK, so I'm over 50, I'm not good at remembering choreography, I'm slow at picking up movements, I'm not especially coordinated, I'm overwieght, and I have bad knees.

Now that that's out of the way...

I bought Irina's video after purchasing Luscious, Bellydance: Beautiful Technique, and Love Potion. It moved a little too quickly for me so I also bought Hard Candy and worked through that while practicing the movements on Irina's Tribal Fusion Workout. Tribal Fusion isn't a particularly easy video for me. I still have problems layering a shimmy on a reverse undulation. And the ""Total Body"" portion is still a little out of my league, what with alternating hip and shoulder shimmies while slowly stepping more or less in place. (I can still hear Irina's instructions in my head which is probably a good sign. ;)) But that's not the fault of the video.

This is where I rebut the more critical review[s]:

1) Nowhere does it say that Tribal Fusion workout is especially geared to beginners. It's an open level video, meaning that the beginner can take the movements she knows how to execute and leave out the layers she has a hard time with, while still achieving a good workout. More skilled dancers can follow the layering at their own levels.

2) Irina does break down the movements, starting slowly and then building speed. The instruction is nuanced so it might escape some people's notice.(It took me a while to figure that out myself.) The initial tutorial is fairly but not excessively slow, as is each section of the workout that follows. By the time the choreography is assembled and you're taking it from the top, the speed has increased ... oh, about double.  But you do get half-time and full speed before that. The breakdown's just not following what may seem to be the standard manner.

3) I do agree that the yoga warm up is fast-paced. I accomodated my lack of coordination (falling over) and inability to keep up by watching that section again and writing down each pose as performed.  I still use the list to keep track of the lefts and rights of salutations so that I use my body evenly. I don't do the side plank poses because I'm not strong enough yet. But I do an extra regular plank pose to make up for that. (Maybe I should do two?) I also get up differently, but that could be because I'm older and my knees don't do what Irina says. That's OK. Later, in the lower body section, Irina talks about ""sensitive knees"" so you know she wouldn't want someone to do what will obviously hurt her. That's just common sense, too.

4) Irina does have ability as a teacher.  Her manner of communicating is simply not what the most critical reviewer was used to.  Every teacher has a different style. If we were in a classroom situation we could ask questions, but this isn't a classroom so we need to parse her meaning. We all had to figure out what other teachers meant, why not Irina? Asking her to be like someone else is unreasonable. I did notice a mix up with lefts and rights sometimes, but I've experienced much worse. The mistakes were few and mild.

5) While I agree that the instruction moved quickly from one movement to the layering that forms a combination, and on to the routine, my inability to keep up isn't the fault of the video. It's already an hour and forty minutes long, so I got a lot of bang for my buck!

6) Part of the beauty of this workout is that you need to pay attention, think, and fine tune your movements. That can take time. Frankly, I would rather use a workout video that's challenging because I won't be easily bored. Right now, I alternate Tribal Fusion with Hard Candy and I use the yoga portion of Tribal Fusion to warm up for both. I've also found and used Irina's ""basic"" instructions on YouTube  (and Howcast). All it took was a little Google. :)",1312675200,43,3809,4.533527696793003
2266800,4,B00095MBQ2,"First off I do not think this DVD is filled with Drills, if you want drills go look somewhere else like Ariella's DVD.  It's more of a combos DVD.  But I don't think that should put you off if you are looking for something different, there is a little bit of a lack of instruction on how to excute the moves, but I think because there title of the DVD is ""The Bellydance Tribal Fusion Workout"" it is safe to assume there won't be that much instruction on how to excute the moves.  I am kind of used to that with workout DVDs in general.  I think Irina is a beautiful dancer and for once not a moody Tribal Dancer.  She has an over all fun combos workout that is fun and you could use it again and again if you wanted.  I would recommend this!",1306281600,,742,4.0479452054794525
2266801,5,B00095MBQ2,I love this workout.  I am a new bellydancer and it help breakdown some of the moves into simple steps.  This also gave a great low impact cardio workout.  I highly recommend it.,1303948800,2,178,4.333333333333333
2266802,4,B00095MBQ2,"After working with this dvd for two months I have to acknowledge it as a favorite since it finds it's way into my dvd player almost every day. Which is not to say it was love at first sight.

I purchased the dvd because I liked the idea of a yoga warm-up, and to this day I ignore it because Irina launches into difficult movements way too quickly. I've done these poses before in yoga class, but they were always towards the end of the session, when we were properly warmed up and limber. I'm sure Irina with her ballet background can go right into them without problem, but I wouldn't recommend it for the beginning at-home enthusiast.

Much better to start with the technique sections where she breaks down the bellydance moves. You won't get a cardio workout from this section, but do it right and you will feel the burn. These moves help tone the midsection, and drilling will whittle away the inches over time. As a bellydance beginner, I stuck solely to this section for the first couple of weeks.

Irina's cues, given in voice-over, are easy to follow, though a little extra info wouldn't hurt in spots. She does not address finger/hand positions, and it gets a little confusing when she changes the vocabulary for describing a move (this happens with undulations and ommies). Two other pet-peeves are her failure to distinguish between pushing the shoulder ""back"" as opposed to returning it to ""center"" when doing shoulder-figure-eights, and the choice of long black pants which obscure the knees/legs. A more seasoned dancer would likely be comfortable with these things, but as a beginner my shoulder movement was sometimes thrown off and I was occasionally left wondering if I was moving my legs correctly.

Nonetheless, Irina is pleasant to listen to, upbeat but calm, with no hint of new-agey-mystical or hyper-aerobic-enthusiasm. Of course, if you ever find yourself tired of the instructions there is the option for a music-only track in the menu.

Once comfortable with the techniques, the viewer can dive into either an upper-body (@16 min) or lower-body workout (@17 min) or a complete workout (@20 min). The choreographed routines are fast paced and demanding. Irina builds element upon element, but unlike the techniques section, there is no slow intro followed by repetition. She treats the viewer like a dancer: she gives you the steps, and assumes you can keep up.

It's definitely a workout, but if your goal is to get the heart-rate in the max zone and drip sweat, you should look elsewhere. The focus here is tribal bellydance, which lacking the jumping and frenetic footwork of your average cardio routine, will not burn as many calories. It will however help tone and lengthen muscles, and increase flexibility.

After the choreography is a quick cool down that is gentle on the body while still providing a good stretch. I often tacked it onto the end of the techniques section, and sometimes even onto other dvd workouts.

Overall, I'm happy with this purchase. Irina's dance style is fluid and graceful while retaining many of the precise movements that are part of the Tribal signature. Not engineered for a beginner - it's marked as ""open"" level - I had to work up to the workout section, but for that reason it has great replay value since I didn't conquer it in a few viewings. I'm also a huge fan of the bonus performance at the end. Her grace and elegance is deeply inspiring.

2266803,5,B00095MBQ2,"A beautiful dancer presents the softer side of Tribal Fusion. Love it! Very thorough, clear and easy to follow instruction. Great combinations that will give you a workout but are not punishing to the body. NOT the same-old-same-old robotic stuff standing in place. This is useable dance choreography and I'm glad to see at least one TF dancer going in this direction. She keeps the bellydance in it too, while still being modern but not gimmicky. I would say this is more for intermediate dancers, and those looking for TF combos to use in class or on stage. Bravo, Irina!",1300147200,2,573,4.74
2266804,3,B00095MBQ2,"Got this for Christmas.  I've been taking dance for about 5 years now and this is definitely not a video for beginners.  The steps are not broken down well and you only see each move about two or three times before she ""speeds it up"".  I'm going to enjoy learning some new things, but I would be frustrated and probably ditch it if I were a beginner.  I would have liked her to teach/speak on the video instead of in voice-over.  If you're familiar with tribal or traditional bellydance style, you'll probably enjoy.  Just watching her dance is a treat, as she is such a beautiful and fluid dancer.  She really softens tribal style.",1293408000,9,632,4.491228070175438
2266805,5,B00095MBQ2,"Irina is such a graceful belly dancer.  You could see a huge dance background in her.
What I liked about this tribal instruction DVD is that she teaches graceful, feminine movements and actually uses, gasp, middle eastern/belly dance music.  Unlike many tribal instruction DVDs that use weird music and a good amount of robotic/chopped up like moves.  Would recommend this for intermediate through advanced belly dancers.
1.  She incorporates in her DVD, yoga warm-up, detail breakdown of moves/drills for upper body, lower body, total body. She starts of simple then builds up layering moves.  She layers the moves into her combos.  Starting off slow and building upon it and bringing up speed.
2.  Her selection of music fits the yoga warm-up (lover her music), her movements/combos and her cool down.  Sounds like middle eastern/belly dance music.
3.  Lovely costumes!
4.  Very MOVING, full costume performance at end.  Irina dances to this beautiful, soulful.  She interprets this song magnificently.
5.  140 minute program, very thorough.  You can tell she put her heart and so much time/energy into this DVD.
6.  It's challenging.  Will take time for me (intermediate) to pickup the layering with nuances.  Will keep one challenged for sometime.
Highly recommend this DVD.  Great bargain for the wealth of instruction.",1290384000,4,1324,5.223809523809524
