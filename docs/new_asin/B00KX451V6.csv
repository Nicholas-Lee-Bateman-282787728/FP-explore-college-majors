8662413,4,B00KX451V6,"I did enjoy this very much and am pleased that there is sufficient interest in the life and work of Leonardo to warrant this kind of investigation. But it has been sensationalized to entertain and is ultimately unpersuasive. The case for the authenticity of the Isleworth Mona Lisa is played up initially by the selective introduction of facts only to be neutralized by more facts presented later on. It is fun to see some of the speculations brought to life in scenes with actors, but, weighing the evidence, it seems far more likely that there was never more than one portrait created, retained, and reworked by the artist unless one imputes inerrancy to the cardinal's scribe who reported after the fact that the artist said he painted the portrait for a Medici prince. (Did that commission also go bad like the one for the Giaconda family? Did the artist keep both versions? Was there a record of the alleged Medici transaction in those meticulous Florentine civic archives?) The two-portrait theory actually makes an even a bigger muddle of things. When all is said and done, I am persuaded that the provenance and condition of the Isleworth portrait are too suspect for it to be authenticated. It is probably just another copy among many.",1525046400,,1244,4.845070422535211
