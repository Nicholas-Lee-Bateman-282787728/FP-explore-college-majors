1622807,1,B00005LMAK,"Most of the actors (not Combs) do a fine job with the material given them (Even the Scott Wieland lookalike as John/Faust). Sad thing is, the material [makes me sick]. Somehow Yuzna and crew manage to turn the underground hardcore comix classic (which I've collected since issue 1) into a low-budget softcore joke. Watching it I kept asking myself - WHY WHY WHY???? Why is M a dracula wannabe with thinning WHITE hair? Why does Faust have cool metallic claws (as in the comic) but a latex-organic suit that he ""morphs"" into like some x-mutant clone? Why is there a cheesy scene in which M morphs Claire into a big-titted blob puddle? Why is there a cheesy-looking hellspawn worm-thing at the end? Why am I laughing at all of this? Why am I crying as the credits roll? My guess is that Faust creators Quinn and Vigil took the money and ran. I hope they are as disappointed in this film as the fans will be and option to make a real one in the future. Provided any filmmaker truly has the balls to make Faust as seen on paper. You'd think it would be easy - the storyboards are right there on the page. I guess that would require some level of respect for the orginal material in the first place.",999648000,,1194,4.382882882882883
1622808,3,B00005LMAK,"I wanted this movie to be so much more than it was.  Having read the comic series from Quinn & Vigil for Rebel Graphics, which was incredibly graphic (violence, gore, sex) bordering on pornographic, I was actually stunned to see a movie adaptation, and only R-rated!!!  Tim Vigil did write the screen play so I can at least give props for the storyline, however, true to form, the comic books are so much better than the movie.  But it is a thoroughly enjoyable romp, plenty of sex, dismemberment and mayhem (even a little BDSM).  If your easily shocked or squeamish, DON'T WATCH THIS.  If you haven't read the comics and like a little kink with your shock, you'll love this adaptation.  But to really enjoy Faust...get the comic books.",999216000,,736,4.666666666666667
1622809,3,B00005LMAK,"Based on the excellent Faust: Love of the Damned comics from David Quinn and Tim Vigil, this film version won't disappoint fans. Brian Yuzna has some decent horror films under his belt, many considered cult classics, and he is at the top of his game here. In his screenwriting debut, David Quinn does a surprisingly decent job, and Yuzna works well with it. Production values are low, as could be expected with a budget of $2 million, but it all comes together. I saw this film at an art house a few month ago, actually, and was pleasantly surprised, especially being a reader of the comics. The look and feel is relatively the same, and the overall style matches well. The graphic sex and violence will no doubt be cut a bit (or a lot...) in this ""R"" version, which pretty much guarantees an unrated/cut version in the future. Overall, Faust is a decent horror movie, with symbolism and style.",994118400,8,894,4.59375

1622829,4,B00005LMAK,"Ok, so 'campy' I think might be the best description for 'Faust'. The screenplay David Quinn wrote to adapt the comic book series was pretty good, and followed the original storyline pretty well, but for anyone looking for just a really well made movie and you have no deep love for the original story, this certainly isn't it.

The acting was mostly good. The cast was for the most part well chosen, except for Jade DeCamp. Seriously casting director, you really should have read the books. She wasn't a waif, however you couldn't have done a better job finding a Claire or M. Clair could really act, and looked dead on the part. M could have used some acting lessons, but looked pretty close to the original. Jhon Jasper's.... I'm not sure what to say here. The guy could act, sort of. Appearance, well, passable I guess.

Overall, a higher production budget I think would have really saved this movie, but it really wasn't bad overall. I'd watch it again (especially since I own it now, right?), but I wouldn't reccomend it as a movie you simply have to see, unless you know and have read about the original comic series before.",1338768000,,1131,4.594059405940594
1622830,3,B00005LMAK,"Faust: Love of the Damned (Brian Yuzna, 2000)

The words ""directed by Brian Yuzna"" on a film are even scarier than the words ""produced by Brian Yuzna"" (q.v. The Nun, elsewhere this ish). Worse, I had no idea when I picked this up that it was a graphic novel adaptation, released at a time when the phrase ""comic book movies"" was defined by unwatchable Batman sequels featuring such master thespians as Jim Carrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger. And then I thought to myself, ""it can't be any worse than Batman Forever. It just can't."" And while I don't want to convey the idea that this is another Sin City, you know what? I was right. I've seen a number of bad Brian Yuzna flicks over the years; this one would vie with The Dentist as my favorite of his directorial efforts.

Plot: John Jaspers (Mark Frost, recently of the TV series Hope Springs) gets picked up and thrown into the loony bin, raving about people out to get him, where he meets psychologist Jade de Camp (Alone's Isabel Brook) and tries to convince her of the danger he's in. No go, unfortunately, and John is summarily dispatched by those very folks who were, in fact, out to get him. M (The Dead Matter's Andrew Divoff) mentions, as they're offing him, that maybe they'll go find that cute doctor. As so often happens in movies like this, Jaspers then decides to deal with a higher authority in order to get revenge (viz. Spawn, The Dead One, The Crow, etc.). Once he's back on the street, well, he starts getting it, while trying to conceal his recently-deceased condition from Jade, who's starting to fall for him, as well.

Yes, it's over the top, but Yuzna's over-the-top style does make for good comic-book mayhem, just as Burton's did in the original Batman film from the eighties. And yeah, Yuzna didn't grab A-listers for this one, but again, let me remind you what happened when Jim Carrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared in Batman-franchise films. It's enough to make you flee screaming to the scale department. (Need I bring up the spectre of Catwoman?) And to be fair, no one here is really a bad actor; Frost comes off as a slightly upscale Thomas Jane, Divoff is his usual scenery-chewing self, and Brook is fine when she's not killing her career by appearing in dreck like About a Boy. Some decent special effects, a few cheesy action scenes, and of course that one scene that seems to be de rigeur in comic-book films where all the bad guys are sitting around a table discussing being bad. (The Crow, Blade, etc.) I think that, while it's not a world-beater or anything, it's taken way too much flack for simply being what it is: a dumb, fun movie where [censored for Amazon consumption] blows up a lot. **",1307664000,2,2690,4.6
1622831,1,B00005LMAK,"First off I would like to state that I'm a fan of horror movies in general, high budget or low budget I'll watch practically anything. I tend to enjoy movies others hate and give poor reviews. Unfortunately this is not the case here. I would rate this a zero in stars if possible.

 Don't waste your time with this, seriously. The acting and script are terrible, and not in the ""oh this is so terrible it's funny/entertaining"" kind of way. It's cringe worthy at times. Someone else wrote the acting's as good as an x rated film and they weren't lying. In fact at times I've seen better in porno. Andrew Divoff and Jeffrey Combs are superb B-movie stars (they're in several of my fav. horror movies), however given the script, shoddy plot, and poor co stars, it's not enough to save this film. The main characters acting is ridiculous, not even decent at best, and ruins any hope of a watchable film. Seriously, this film is worse than any student films I saw in college.

Again I just wanna point out I love horror films, loved Re-Animator, Wishmaster, The Thing, Susperia, Evil Dead, From Beyond, Dagon, and others in this category, but this isn't even worth the hour and a half. It was like they decided there should be tits, gore, and action, but didn't ever figure out how to present it in any kind of viewable manner. The music is also a let down for the most part. During the action scenes there's always some sort of heavy metal music playing, except that it's loud and with the vocals, which hearing someone sing for me at least, makes me really aware I'm watching a film with music playing over top of it. I wanted to see a movie, not a music video. Anyways, this is my first Amazon review, and only because I felt raped of the last hour and a half spent watching this abortion of a flick. Hopefully this will help SOMEONE avoid watching this.

I've never read the comic, but from what practically every review and article on this movie, it varies greatly, so I'd assume if you're a fan, you'll be more pissed than I am.",1285200000,,2029,4.446236559139785
1622832,3,B00005LMAK,"Its -NOT- the sellers fault but this was really silly. Thought it would be like ""Spawn"" but wasn't even close. Even the effects were cheezy! If you like movies that are really bad but don't care, then this is for you! I thought there would be alot of action and supernatural stuff in it but it was just corny. The women looked great ,(That was the only thing going for this movie!)",1277337600,,381,4.305555555555555
1622833,1,B00005LMAK,"Altho Re-Animator and a few others were good, this is a horrorible what-should-have-been a late 80's low to no budget UP! All Night!! late night showtime aw-trocity. Screaming Mad George is THEE worst FX guy on the planet. Stan Winston wouldn't wipe his a$$ with this tard. Brian Yuzna the new Ed Wood or Roger Corman has ruined multiple projects in his way-too-long to have a career by now get over Return of the Living Dead 3 wish we could have afforded CGI then you loser. Yeah maybe if this were a 1986 production a la Night of the Creeps but jeez this is so boring stiff and miscast even Jeffrey Combs couldn't begin to save it.

Overall I suffered more watching this than when my (ex)girlfriend made me watch Blue Crush.

I can't even give this a A for effort--Just like the Spider-Man movies-did you actually read the comics before you assumed command???",1257638400,,861,4.584415584415584
1622834,2,B00005LMAK,It has the acting and writing talents of a bad porn flick.  Enough said.,1256083200,,72,4.142857142857143
1622835,1,B00005LMAK,"Yes, it's true: this movie is terribly made. And like most everyone else here is saying, I agree that it's not worth watching or renting. Even reading the comic book before seeing this movie doesn't help, because it's so far removed from the book that it's insulting.

I can understand that in an hour and a half film it's not possible to capture the entire comic book (it would really take a mini-series to do it properly or at least a 2-hour epic with a Frank Miller (""Sin City"", ""300"") budget), but they did things that weren't even in the comic book; things that make the comic book so great.

I definitely wouldn't use this movie to judge the comic book. Everyone who was disappointed with the film should search out the collected trade paperbacks of the Faust comic book series to see how great Faust: Love of the Damned truely is.",1207267200,,837,4.5
1622836,1,B00005LMAK,"This movie was just plain terrible. Our demonic wolverine character attempts to become an ""anti-hero"" by denying his animalistic desires, including killing. Poorly concieved this movie appears to have been scripted in live action, if there was even a script. If you're looking for the meaning of life, you won't find it in this film. If you're looking for laughter, you won't find it here either. This film is a mixture of all the worst parts of Wishmaster, X-Men's Wolverine character, Freddy Cruger's worst one liners. If you must watch this film, watch it on cable during a Halloween festival. Don't even bother renting it.",1192147200,,626,4.9714285714285715
1622837,1,B00005LMAK,"If you're into comics, you may remember a little something called Faust from way back when.  Going to new extremes in terms of violence and sex, any new ground broken by Faust would be overshadowed by Todd MacFarlane's Spawn years later, which basically has the same premise.  In either event, frequent Stuart Gordon partner Brian Yuzna, who has directed Re-Animator sequels as well as the excellent Return of the Living Dead 3, helms this adaptation of Faust, and as you can guess by reading the various reviews, the results are disastrous.  I don't mind cheesy or low budget horror flicks one bit, but Faust stinks to high heaven with it's mostly lame effects and ridiculous costume.  Mark Frost stars as a revenge driven artist seeking vengeance for the death of his girlfriend.  This leads to a deal with a demon named M (the Wishmaster himself, Andrew Divoff), and soon enough he's transformed into a bloodthirsty creature with Wolverine-esque claws and an insane temperment.  The acting is beyond horrible, especially Frost as the whiny main character.  The only time we get a respite is from the brief appearances from Jeffrey ""Re-Animator"" Combs, but even his talents can't save this waste.  The Roadrunner Records soundtrack doesn't help either, and it's just hard to believe that a film this bad could come from Yuzna.  Faust isn't even in the ""so bad it's good"" territory; avoid at all costs.",1178928000,,1403,4.9361702127659575

1622839,4,B00005LMAK,"Brian Yuzna decided to take on the rather saucy Quinn/Vigil comic, and from what you'll read in many reviews(not just Amazon), he did not succeed.  Alot of people have said that this is the absolute worst film they've ever seen.  Well, that's pushing it a tad.  Obviously these folks haven't seen anything by Michael Bay.  Anyhow, this was kind of a damned(no pun intended) project from the getgo considering the source.  If you haven't read it, let me assure you that it's extreme.  In order to make it 100% accurate it would have to be a big budget porno flick, and since it has a story with depth, it would probably make a lousy porno flick.  Quinn is actually on board as the screenwriter, so it does try it's best to cram 15 or so comics into 100 minutes.  Basically what we got is an artist hell bent on revenge after the murder of his girlfriend.  He signs a contract with a demon(Andrew Divoff back in his Wishmaster personna) and gains super powers and some nifty bracelets which have Wolverine-like claws.  The downside is that he has an uncontrollable rage, a bad costume and unquenchable bloodlust.  He's also bound to serve Andrew Divoff.  Given hope(which he's not supposed to have) from a psychologist, he goes rogue and attempts to destroy Divoff.  Good points?  Divoff, though a bit typecast, does a very good job and is given quite a bit of screen time.  The movie's got enough cheesiness, sex and gore to satisfy any B-movie lover.  The always lovable Jeffery Combs is in it, though his role is kind of a throwaway.  Bad points?  Depends on who you ask.  The stuff people hate about this movie are what make it enjoyable for me, coz I happen to like this sort of thing.  I wasn't too crazy on this Mark Frost guy who played Faust.  When he's not in costume, he's usually just a whiney wuss.  And I don't quite see how the psychologist falls in love with the guy an hour after meeting him when all he's done in her presence is act crazy and slaughter police officers.  Alot of people call this a ripoff of Spawn, and I guess I can see where they get that considering this comic wasn't very big or as popular as Spawn.  If memory serves though, I believe Faust came out either before or right around the same time as Spawn.  Early nineties, I know for sure.  I'll tell you one thing, Daddy-O, this movie has the violence that the Spawn movie shoulda had.  Should you watch this movie?  If you like The Dentist, yes.  If you love Daredevil, no.",1115164800,,2460,4.465168539325843

1622843,1,B00005LMAK,"I was hoping for a faithful rendition Tim Vigil's Faust comic, which in and of itself is horror at it's finest. It saddens me actually to see such a great story as presented in the comic twisted in this way.
  The acting is less than interesting, the only redeeming feature I found to this move was having Jeffery Coombs in it. For anyone that's a J.C fan he once again presents a character that is subtle and shakey, and yet just horrifying in his insanity. You got to love the guy. In addition, Isabel Brook ( Jane) has great legs, and we get to see them a lot.
  Aside from these two points, I left the credits feeling very disappointed. I agree with a reviewer above that the comic should have been much more in the way of it's sexuality ( at least a light X ) and the drizzling insanity of Jasper should have been delved into much deeper. I wouldn't buy it.
  And for gosh sakes, they don't even have Jasper quoting or singing 'Papa Has a Brand New Bag'. That was Jasper's trademark in the comic.",1071273600,6,1001,4.26984126984127

1622845,2,B00005LMAK,"""Faust: Love of the Damned"" was a total rip-off of ""Spawn"". It has the exact same storyline...But it's still funny to see that this flick is gorier than the Mark Dipp's realistic version of ""Spawn"", which used to be an ultra-violent comic book series. To me, ""Faust: Love of The Damned"" was a revenge. It was everything I wanted to see in ""Spawn"" a couple of years ago. I admit that I am not at all a fan of comic books,
I'd even say I find most of them stupid, but I always had a better feeling about ""Spawn"", because of its values, the hero, and especially the fact that the hero is a very violent character that has to learn how to control his hatred, the violence he keeps inside...Anyways, I always thought that Spawn didn't limit himself at kicking the bad guys' butts and knocking them to the floor, he got straight to the point; he kills them. And he doesn't say a bunch of cheesy lines after he has killed someone, and he doesn't beat up a bad guy and save him before he falls down a building, to show his good intentions, his lust for justice.
Actually, you may believe that what I'm saying is besides the point. It is not. Because, like I said before, ""Faust"" and ""Spawn"" are pretty much the same thing. It also has elements taken from ""The Crow"", (Spoilers) like the hero's girlfriend that is raped and killed by a bunch of felons. First, there is absolutely no explanation of why they killed her. Anyways, it's not that important, even though that's the reason why John Jaspers (Faust) signs a pact with a mysterious man (played by Andrew Divoff). Anyways, I won't tell you the whole storyline because, first, it is bad (it has less elements and details that ""Spawn""'s or ""The Crow""'s, but I am NOT saying that the storylines of these movies are BAD), and second, see both of the movies I just mentionned, and you'll have exactly the same thing, with more richness and explanations.
""Faust"" may be an absolute copy of two better movies, but that's not where the main interest is, and I'm not saying this only from a personnal view. It's all about the gore. And Faust, in one scene, after having killed a dozen of bandits (and he kills them in very gruesome ways, with many graphic mutilations and lots of blood) simply looks at the camera, like he is talking to the viewer, and says: ""Too much blood, or not enough?""...That's the moment where I caught the whole point. And that particular quote made me stop the movie, and think for a while...I looked at the box, and I saw ""Directed by Brian Yuzna""...I had my explanation.
Yuzna directed a handful of pretty bloody movies, and usually doesn't deliver a very impressive scenario, but focuses on the gore aspect. That's okay, but it seemed like he tried to make something with values, something with a certain philosophy. That's not a bad idea, but he took someone else's ideas. So, I guess he'll have to keep on making stupid gory movies. It's his style, and really, today, that's original, because REAL gore movies are rare these days. And believe me, ""Faust: Love of The Damned"" is filled with gore, from the beginning to the end. I could easily say it's one of the goriest films of the last five or six years. It really has scenes of dismemberment, mutilations, and more. And what about the shotgun hits...they were nice...It's in a scene where a woman armed with a shotgun stands in front of two men and shoots one in the torso. The guy flies away and there's lots of blood. but then comes another pretty violent act; the woman shoots a guy that is lying on the floor point blank with the shotgun. The head simply explodes. There's also a weird scene involving Andrew Divoff and the woman, where he seems to give her a huge orgasm by simply looking at her, but she then mutates into some kind of worm. I just didn't get the point of that scene.
The special effects techniques are very nice, they don't use any computers and the gore is really effective. Faust's costume looks somehow goofy, with the very fake thorns, and the ""X-men""'s Wolverine aspect. Plus, I'd say that the actor himself makes the hero look inoffensive. He's not a very good actor. And his voice, his face, and his text couldn't really make us believe that he's a powerful superhero. He proves it, though, in many violent sequences where he wastes dozens of people.
The imagery is varied,and sometimes pretty nice, and there's a certain mood in the film, but the weakness of the character development ruins it all. Anyways, for fans of Yuzna, this should be your treat, but for fans of good movies, and for people who don't have the slightest interest in gore, this is pure trash. But, if you are interested in gore cinema, this film is, I think, one of the greater models of what gore should still be. In the gore aspect, this is very close to old school gore movies. It's a survivor, and a strong one, in the level of gore and in the quality of the effects. This really is a violent film, it's really as violent as Hong Kong's mangas or very bloody Comic Books.
Finally, I can say that this is a joy to see that gore remains present in the world of films, that it's not completely dead, but so rare are the films of that genre these days, that we have to be happy with movies such as this one. Compare it that way: If you're in a desert, and you're really thirsty, and suddenly, you see an oasis where the water tastes real bad, you'll still drink, and try to forget the taste. It's exactly the same thing with us, the gore fans, that are suffering from the nostalgia of what we miss today. We are ready to swallow anything that has very nice gore, even if the scenario plain sucks. Sorry.
But, overall...as a film....this is bad...really...",1065484800,,5680,4.478302796528448

1622847,3,B00005LMAK,"Thsi movie is based on a comic book of the same name.  It's probably one of the most graphic comic books I have ever read, in that it has copious amounts of sex and violence inherent in its' storylines.  Having read the comic, I was suprised to find that someone had adapted it into a movie, or, atleast tried.  Seeing that it was directed by Brian Yuzna, who produced such movies as Re-Animator, From Beyond, and Return of the Living Dead 3, I thought it might be pretty good.  Now I knew they probably would be able to incorporate the amount of sex and violence into this movie to be true to the comic, so I tried to keep an open mind going into this movie.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  The story involves a man who sells his soul in order to gain demonic powers in order to dispatch the criminals that have taken his life away from him, namely by killing his wife.  The price he pays ends up being more than he thought, as the demon M, who gave him his powers in exchange for his soul, has other plans for him.  This does come off a little like Todd McFarlanes Spawn, but not as slick graphically but unlike Spawn it did have nudity and some sexual situations.  There were flaws in continuity and the acting was pretty bad at times, but I ended up just going with the flow.  I was a little disappointed with some of the scenes where Faust was dispatching bad guys using his razor claws as they didn't seem as graphic as they should have been.  When you slice someone throat or guts open with 12 inch razor claws, you expect a lot more blood than was shown.  Some of those effects looked really cheap and could have been done better.  Some of the effects were done pretty well.  There is some CGI involved, but I think there was more use of prosthetics which looked a little phoney at times but overall not bad.  Hardcore fans of the comic may be disappointed in the shortcomings of the film, but I did feel that they tried to do the best the could with what they had.  I felt the title role was miscast with Mark Frost, but that's my opinion.  I think a different lead actor and bigger production budget would have made a big difference.",1057622400,,2156,4.270935960591133

1622851,3,B00005LMAK,"Faust - Love of the Damned began in a very promising manner that made me think, foolishly, that this was going to be a really good movie. We were introduced to John Jasper, whose girlfriend had been murdered while he watched, as he contemplated his eventual demise above a rushing river. Enter ""the mysterious M,"" a demon of supposed caliber (that later proves he is, at least, funny in a molten flesh kinda way), who offers John a way to avenge his lover's death. Well, Jasper accepts, is given some wolverinesque claws that he carves some people up with, is arrested by the fan-beloved Jeffrey Combs, and is subsequently put in a wittle padded room with a doctor that wants to musically restore his sanity.
Had the movie ended here, in the first few minutes, I would have been happy. It didn't, however, much to my dismay.
Without giving away anything about the loosely conceived plotline, a defect I can deal with, or some really bad (with the exception of J. Combs) acting, another flaw I can stomach, I will comment on the one reason F.L.O.T.D. found itself in the cutting room dumpster with every other movie that forgot that one small monster/demon movie rule. Always, no matter how creepy your storyline, how hideous your monstrous finale, or how paltry your budget, remember to invest a something in your main demonically enhanced character that allows him to at least look presentable. A foam suit portrayal of muscles, some posable claws, and a few red eye shots really did make me laugh at first, but the laughter ended after a while and the need for fast-forwarding the action sequences began. When demons are beheading people, you really shouldn't even have that type of reaction.
Were it not for Combs (an actor I regard and vote for with much bias), the sheer wickedness of our demonic bargain-giver, and the monstrous ending of the movie, I would have sold my soul for a narcoleptic relapse just to escape the torment.

1622852,1,B00005LMAK,"Man, this one is really bad.  I can sit through anything, but geez!  Yuzna really messes up big time.  I'm not familiar with the comic book this horror flick is based on and it may hold some appeal to fans of that series, but any normal horror film viewer will surely find this excruciating to sit through.
I have read that the R-rated cut is the only version available on US video/DVD and surely this doesn't help matters.  I saw the film on premium cable TV (where it 'premiered at 3am - if that's any clue) and it was listed as ""UNRATED"", but from watching it, it was clearly the edited R print.  Every gore scene was edited so quickly that it was almost impossible to figure out what was going on half the time.  Not that you really care, anyway.  Scenes are cleary edited down eliminating obviously over-the-top gore that you can tell must have once been there.  And if a movie really stinks - and this one does - at least some wild unedited gore efx would make it easier to sit through.  But the R version is just lacking all the way around.
The film looks cheap (you can just 'feel' the film crew working right out of camera range).  The actors all try to ham it up and fail miserably.  Jeffrey Combs is slumming it again playing the same crazed character he always does.  The ""Wishmaster"" guy is here sans makeup - he needs some, trust me.  The female lead is as dull as dirt with that stupid phony accent trying to make it seem like she's intelligent.  And then there's all those stupid monster-slime effects - man are they bad - they so much scream ***80's***!!!!  Yep, I believe they were done  by Screaming Mad George and they look just as rubbery and fake as they did 15 years ago.  And don't even get me started on the demon Faust character's superhero (???) suit.  Hahahaha!  Boy...it's hard to believe this got made in the 21st century.
I usually find Yuzna's films to be quite entertaining and some of them actually quite excellent....but FAUST is disastrous.  Even if it was the uncut version, it would still be a mess --- just a slightly more watchable one.
You've been warned.  If you must subject yourself to this tedious home movie, brew up a LOT OF COFFEE and have that ffwd button ready.  The pits.",1022112000,3,2222,4.407862407862408
1622853,3,B00005LMAK,"If you cross ""Wolverine"" of the ""X-Men"" with the looks of ""Spawn"", add some strange humor and lots of gore: You have ""Faust""!!!
It's a fun to watch movie which fallows the rules of comic adaptations, but the violence of the comic hasn't been restricted as much as in (for example) the more or less ""harmless"" Spawn-feature. Although the movie is very violent, it's very tamed down compared with the ""Faust"" comics (in terms of gore and sex).
The main character is a bit week, but the bad guy is great. The budget wasn't too high - you see that espacially during the showdown-F/X.
All in all Brian Yuzna has done better, but as a friend of comic adaptations I can recommend this flick as good (but brainless) entertainment.
The US-DVD is cut and rated ""R"" - I own the ""unrated"" version (a Spanish DVD), which is a few minutes longer, but still not nearly as sexy and violent as the comic ... my review is about the uncut version.",1015891200,,928,4.464705882352941
1622854,4,B00005LMAK,"This movie is a very clever idea, and very well pulled off.  This is based on an underground comic (what is that anyway) of the same name.  The movie stars Geoffry Combs (Re-Animator) as a detective trying to find out why this artist just killed an entire Arabian Family (Very big family, and very rich).  As it turns out the Artist tried to kill himself earlier but then sold his soul to a guy named M and was given these razor sharps claws (taken from the prop department of X-Mne) and he did what he was told.  After he escapes he is betrayed and killed, only to come back in a bright red satanic looking DareDevil Costume and is know as the Super Hero Faust.
This movie is funny..., despite how seriouse it starts.  It turns downright hillariouse.  The costume alone will make you crack up.  this dark comedy holds all the aspects of a typical horror film, gore, pointless violence, loads of nudity and [gratuitous] sex, yet it pokes fun at itself with the story.  This would fit right in if your a fan of such classics (and not so classics) as Army of Darkness, Critters, or Ghoulies.

1622856,3,B00005LMAK,"A fan of the comic book version since it surfaced in the late 80's (see my quote in issue #7!), I've been waiting for this film version for about a decade.  Die hard fans of the comic book series will find a lot to like in this movie but, unfortunately, you'll probably be irritated with a lot of things, too.  I understood beforehand that to do FAUST in a manner that truly reflects the spirit of its creators, it needed to be rated XXX -- or something beyond that!  Nevertheless, while shooting for the 'R' rating, opportunities to make this a better movie were missed.  Starting my list of gripes is the beautiful actress they got to play Jade DeCamp doesn't get naked ONCE in this film!  During the ritual scene, Jade begins to have sex ... completely clothed!  This is FAUST I'm watching, right?  It just made no sense, especially since so many other characters are nude at some point in this film.  There were the makeup and continuity errors -- Jade is viciously tortured by Claire in one scene... or so you'd think!  The next time you see Jade she has a few dabs of blood on her back.  By the following scene, she has miraculously recovered from her ordeal entirely!  The topper has to be earlier in the film, when M tells Jaspers that sleep will become a distant memory for him when he accepts his powers.  Later on, Jade is lured from Jasper's apartment by the villian -- while Jaspers is asleep!  Although those things drove me nuts, I forgave this movie and everyone involved once I heard Jaspers say, ""What's the matter?  Don't you like my art?""  Yes, this could've been better -- but even as it is, it STILL tops The Crow 2:City of Angels and the last two Batman flicks!",1008633600,3,1684,4.4397394136807815

As I am (or was) a comic book nerd, I noticed the error in some of these reviews citing Tim Vigil as the writer of the story. Tim Vigil was the artist who helped create Faust, with David Quinn, who wrote the book, and the screenplay to this movie.
With that said, this flick was horrendously bad. Being familiar with the comic book's excessive gore, sex, and mysticism, the movie came off as a pathetically sugar-coated version of the extremist stand the book took. Watered down and held down by a mediocre budget, this movie is bad in almost all possible ways. Jeffrey Combs should have stayed out of this one, as I normally like his work.
Avoid this film at all costs. I knew it was trouble when I found out the film was going to be rated ""R."" To truly create Faust on the big screen, at least an ""NC-17"" was necessary, if not an ""unrated.""",1008633600,,904,4.419161676646707

Horror movies have gone to the dogs, and it's sad that there is no more ceativity in this genre. This movie has bad acting, pails of gore, and an anti super hero that looks like something dug up from Inframan. Combs is wasted. His role adds nothing to the stupid plot. I wasted my money.",1004313600,,424,4.379746835443038
1622861,3,B00005LMAK,"Let me begin by saying that I am a big Brian Yuzna fan. Since he (and Stuart Gordon) exploded onto the screens in the 80s with RE-ANIMATOR I have been hooked. It's also been great to see that they have both consistently worked in the horror and fantasy genre ever since, cranking out gems like SOCIETY, CASTLE FREAK and THE BEYOND. This now brings me to FAUST. I have been looking forward to this first release from Yuzna's new spanish film studio for a long time. Then I got to see it . . . the film is very weird. It has a strong spanish feel to it (obviously), but it also tries to pander to the US market (also quite obvious). But, this is where the movie ultimately fails. By trying too hard to be american, the entire movie comes across very fake and awkward.
The problems come very early on. Lead actor Mark Frost is drastically underwritten and therefore displays the emotional range of a paper cup. His eternal grimacing face reminds me of Beaker from THE MUPPETS. The always excellent Jeffrey Combs seems uncomfortable in his miscast role of the tough inner-city cop. (See him shine in THE FRIGHTENERS and the pointless I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER). Andrew Divoff excels (as always) but his character too seems underwritten to the point that when he comes on screen I almost forgot why he was actually in the film. Oh yeah, he's the villain . . . The female members of the film are very good. Isabelle Brook is a strong performer and holds the emotional arm of the film really well. The deliciously villainous Monica Van Campen camps it up in a major way to steal all of her (very brief) scenes. Screaming Mad Georges' effects work is yet again imaginative and strange, and cinematographer Jacques Haitkin gives the movie a vibrant and exotic look. Comic-book writer Tim Vigils' script is littered with cliche and none of the dramatic horror that the comic book itself had. When Frost turns into the clawed creature of the title, he comes across as a second rate villain from the 60s BATMAN TV show, and not a hardcore horror icon that was present in the Rebel Studios original comic.
The disc itself is good. There are two commentary tracks (one by Yuzna - informative and interesting) and one by Mad George, Divoff and Haitkin - okay, Divoff has a great voice). The picture quality is sharp and the soundtrack is good. All in all, the movie is okay - not one of Yuzna's best efforts, but whatever he makes it is certainly a lot more exciting than a lot of horror movies out there. One thing puzzles me about this LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT disc though, is that it doesn't seem to have an MPAA rating. Can anyone tell me if this is the unrated version? Or is it the R? It's just that I heard the unrated version was very extreme and had to be cut, and this doesn't seem all that gory a movie. Anyway, onto the next. Maybe Yuzna's next movie BEYOND RE-ANIMATOR will deliver the undead goods, and give Jeffrey Combs another chance to bring out his best role . .",1004313600,,2978,4.46605504587156
1622862,1,B00005LMAK,"To say this movie is a waste of time, effort and money is an understatement. Where do I even begin? The following review is my scathing unappreciation and blatant disappointment with this cinematic adaptation. The only reason I write it is to be fair to the creators and fans of a visionary and one-of-a-kind creation that is 'Love of the Damned' of which this movie is adapted from.

First off this feature should have been written, produced, and created as a NC-17 or a XXX production. There's no denying that is the first crucial mistake. A rating such as NC-17 was essential to properly translate the imagery and feel integral to making it a worthwhile effort. To even try to bring it to screen with anything less was the road to ruin.

Secondly, the movie failed to capture the vision and passion the source material displays so vividly! Not just with the lack of carnage or sexual elements, but I failed to identify with the characters...their nature and ambitions. Their fears, inner secrets and motivation integral to the story were brief and two-dimensional. Quinn as the screenplay writer tried to keep this intact, but the constraints he must have been under lead to utter failure. This is by far what I found overall to inhibit any sense of enjoyment I might have found in the adequate special effects or condensation of material for a movie. Just flat, generic, and stupid.

I could hammer on other areas of the film...but why? After missing the above crucial areas it's a dead horse. In closing I stress: so many things could have been lackluster if the crucial elements of story, feel, and imagery were present and accounted for!

Seek out the original comics first. Then, if you have to - pick this up dirt cheap or download it, but be warned it stinks in comparison, actually there is no comparison.",1003968000,,1816,4.719242902208202

A rule-breaking police officer (Jeffrey Combs; Lurking Fear, Doctor Mordrid, Would You Rather) crosses paths with some sort of music therapist after our Faustian protagonist makes a deal with a white-haired euro-trashy fiend and is granted Street Fighter II Vega wrist blades to avenge the death of his murdered immigrant girlfriend.  Sounds like somebody got snubbed at the 2001 Academy Awards for Best Screenplay, doesn't it?

As the mysterious near-albino Mephistopheles figure, Andrew Divoff (Wishmaster, Lost) is deliciously ridiculous and I struggle to rationalize his hair.  But trumping the lunacy of his hair is the rampaging melodrama and varying sound quality.  More Oscar near-misses, no doubt.

Faust breaks the Devil's rules and is sent to Hell, which he promptly escapes by defeating an animated skeleton.  I know, the scene wasn't very inspired and I'd imagine evading damnation would have posed a greater challenge.  Moreover when he emerges he is like a demonic superhero complete with cape, latex muscles, and silly CGI transformations. This is, after all, based on a comicbook.  It's tone yo-yos between clearly deliberately silly at times, and somewhat serious at others.  The finale pits our Faustian inverse-hero against a ritually summoned Hell beast.

There's a good amount of action, all being of awful cheesy execution.  But that's to be expected when you have topless women slitting throats mid-coitus and women in bras beating men up.  With that, there's also a fair amount of graphic sex scenes and nudity accompanied by a hefty dose of low budget gore like rooms filled with severed limbs and heads, flesh-tearing, face-ripping, face-melting and dismemberment.  And to top off the special effects, there's a deeply perverted slimy transformation scene that is too gross, smutty and tasteless for me to explainbut a quick GoogleImage search for ""Faust love of the damned boob"" should explain things.

This is the worst film I've seen by director by Brian Yuzna (Society, Bride of Re-Animator, Return of the Living Dead 3).  This cheesy comic book adaptation is utterly terrible, but if you're in the mood for a specifically really bad horror movie, then this might be right up your alley.  So maybe it's terrible in all the right ways.  If you know what I mean by that, watch and enjoy this gory, silly flick.  If you don't, then skip it.",1457308800,2,2569,5.142168674698795
