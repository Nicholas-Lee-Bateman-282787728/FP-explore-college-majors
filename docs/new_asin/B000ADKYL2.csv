8324029,1,B000ADKYL2,"As a Soldier currently deployed to Afghanistan, I purchased this DVD for a little pick me up. This DVD is misleading in it's "" Tribute to the Military"" title. There was nothing patriotic about these comedians, they used the ""N"" word alot, and their comments were tasteless and thoughtless, and by no means was I entertained. I am glad that I reviewed this DVD before allowing my soldiers to view it. I was insulted by this DVD. I would not reccommend this DVD to Anyone, military or civillian. Signed,Unsatisifed Sergeant in Afghanistan. Too bad I had to wait 3 weeks to recieve it here.",1173830400,2,587,4.653846153846154
