8441636,2,B004ULEERA,It was boring. There is one with the same name that was very funny in the second half.,1481760000,,86,3.8333333333333335

8441638,4,B004ULEERA,It had a good plot going for it. Movies from the 40's and 50's had a certain quality.,1476921600,,85,3.7777777777777777
8441639,2,B004ULEERA,"Plot was ok, but I kept waiting for Robert Preston to break into a version of ""76 Trombones"".  His acting was very stiff..",1457568000,,122,4.304347826086956
8441640,5,B004ULEERA,Robert Preson is very good in this one. He shows another side of himself while giving you a peek into the soul of someone who feels revenge is necessary. The moral to this story is: think more than twice when you pursue revenge. An oldie but goodie.,1444262400,,249,4.319148936170213
8441641,3,B004ULEERA,"Interesting low budget film about codebreaker Preston, just after World War II, using his skills to track down the people responsible for his wife's death. Preston has the voice, but he is much lower key than Professor Harold Hill. For further research, well worth checking out are Writer Leo Marks, World War II agent Violette Szabo, and the 1958 film Carve Her Name with Pride.",1444176000,,379,4.846153846153846

8441643,3,B004ULEERA,"This movie is an example of post-war British film noir.  Robert Preston (later of Music Man fame), an ex-resistance fighter and now manager of a cryptographic decoding group, vows vengeance when his loving wife is killed by a hit and run driver fleeing a murder.  Today, we would probably call him a victim of wartime PTSD.  Watch this movie with a historical eye--otherwise it will strike you as being somewhat corny.",1397865600,,418,4.859154929577465
8441644,4,B004ULEERA,"The setting for this film is post-war England. Despite the appearance of American actor Robert Preston, the mood is dark, angry, and very British. Just below the surface is a seething, barely contained rage--understandable when we consider the terrible losses Britain suffered under Nazi attack. An emphasis on puzzles suggest the pre-war mystery genre, but this story's conclusion is pure noir. While not a great film, this is a movie well worth watching.",1356220800,,456,5.260273972602739
