8719993,4,B00ZE7XVU0,"Very nicely produced with an interesting range of topics of discussion.  Anyone interested in this performer will want to see the interview.

I must object however to the lack of documentation of many of the musical performances excerpted in the program.  There are no indications of dates or collaborators for such excerpts as Prokofiev 3rd concerto, Chopin 2nd concerto; dates of early recital excerpts would also be of interest.  (Well, I just looked on youtube for the Prokofiev and that was easily found.... so perhaps one can discover the documentation in that way.  But the producers of the DVD should be more conscientious and thorough.)",1457654400,2,645,5.104761904761904
