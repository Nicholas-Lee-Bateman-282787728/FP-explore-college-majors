8482912,5,B005Q2WM3A,"Based on the famous Broadway play, Burlesque, it was filmed before as Dance of Life and Swing High, Swing Low.  This Technicolor version stars the #1 female movie star of the 1940s, Betty Grable, and Dan Dailey who received an Oscar nomination.  With great support from Jack Oakie, June Havoc, James Gleason and Richard Arlen, When My Baby Smiles at Me deserves to be restored and issued on DVD and even Blu-ray!",1520812800,,412,4.708333333333333

8482914,4,B005Q2WM3A,gr8 vaudeville story but I wish the copy was clearer. They don't make these gr8 movies anymore like this one,1366588800,3,108,4.45
8482915,2,B005Q2WM3A,"I sincerely hope that FOX will issue a studio dvd of this film. The dvd I just purchased has a white line running along the left side of the frame for 93 minutes...and THAT is a long white line,  The picture is quite fuzzy (as if it had been photographed through black velveteen!).  Betty Grable, Dan Daily, June Havoc, and Jack Oakie are quite wonderful and the film also reprises a number of burlesque routines and blackouts that make it unusually interesting.  A BLURAY disc would be nice, but just a decent transfer of a decent print would be ten times better than what seems to be avilable.  Betty Grable was a great star and a great entertainer.  She loved to sing and dance and that always made a considerable contribution to what she was doing.  She also had a very
sensational figure AND legs that everyone wanted to see.  All of that delight falls by the wayside when the quality of the dvd is so sadly deficient.  I will
gladly (and quickly) buy another copy if you will tell me (truthfully now) that it is excellent",1362700800,7,1027,4.454545454545454
8482916,4,B005Q2WM3A,"The dvd I bought was sopposed to be a copy of a public domain movie. I sure hope it was. It was copied from a vhs tape, you can tell by some film jumps. Pretty good copy. The movie was wonderful. It was a good story and good acting. Lots of song and dance. Worth the money.",1348358400,5,273,3.807017543859649
