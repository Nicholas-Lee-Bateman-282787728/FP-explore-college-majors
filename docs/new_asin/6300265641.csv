7807651,4,6300265641,"We have here one of the major plays by Shakespeare but it is not the one that is most often played or really and extensively quoted. This is a political play with practically nothing else around. The political bones are the very flesh of this animal. Julius Caesar is a very short lived hero in this play. He dies so fast that we can't even remember his face. He is the hero of the play absent most of the time by failure of living long enough. A small group of people come together to assassinate Julius Caesar because they are jealous of his fame and his power and his popularity. They manage to get Brutus, the closest friend of Julius Caesar on their side and he will deliver the third but killing blow. Then from that moment on the play is hijacked and becomes the retribution to the killers. Mark Antony is the first and essential craftsman of that reversal of fate. He manages to bring the popular crowd of Rome against the self-declared liberators. And then the whole thing will have to be solved on the battlefield. Brutus' brother will be lured into asking his ex-prisoner and freed soldier to kill him, which this one does with willingness because he can flee and be free after so many years of dependence. Then all the members of the conspiration die one after another till the last one Brutus who manages to force a simple soldier to hold the sword on which he runs himself. This is a typical cycle and construction for Shakespeare: someone disturbs the fragile equilibrium of society and society re-establishes its balance by eliminating every single member of the group that disturbed the peace of this society, Rome in this case. The victors are those who were close to the first victim but not so close that they could have been eliminated at the same time as him. If you listen careful to the play there are some tricky phrases that reveal more about Shakespeare's style. ""What trash is Rome? What rubbish? What offal?"" Three questions, three negative words, three is the dooming number, the number of disquiet and disorder. ""Brutus is noble, wise, valiant and honest. Caesar was mighty, bold, loyal and loving."" That could be the perfect equilibrium of four plus four equal eight except that this balance is unbalanced by the antagonistic pair ""is/was"", and the order is important and means a rejection of the great man who has just been assassinated. It is a second assassination. And Brutus will give the logic of this construction by adding a fifth qualifying adjective, the fifth one of the diabolical pentacle, ""ambitious"", in a declaration that is the reversal of the tense line I have just pointed out: ""As he was ambitious I slew him."" It is obvious that this political assassination has no legal nor ethical foundation: it is the decision and the deed of a solitary man who decides all by himself that someone else has to die. This is tyranny if tyranny does exist somewhere. This play is probably less considered than Hamlet because there is no sentimental, emotional or simply personal element in it. It is pure politics and as such it is austere and even cold, but Anthony and Cleopatra, or Macbeth, or King Lear have that ""personal dimension that makes them ""better"". The production of this play by the BBC is maybe slightly too slow. They did a good effort for the setting to look grand enough not to be reduced to a sound stage, and for the crowds to be numerous enough to look like crowds, well at least large groups of people. But they could and should have tightened up the rhythm of the play. It is true too that the very difficult part of Brutus is maybe slightly too inward oriented, reserved or pacified. Brutus is a fool who lets himself be fooled by jealous mediocre people who brandish the name of his ancestor who stood in front of Tarquin when his wife Lucretia was raped (and Shakespeare knew all the details since he wrote a narrative poem entitled The Rape of Lucrece) and by some other more or less superficial and light arguments. Any sane general and any wise politician should have said no. We know he did not. But that's the shortcoming of the character and to render such an easily influenced person is extremely difficult and in this production they decided not to make him cynical but that might have been more credible or believable. How could a fool like him become a general who was instated by the greatest general of the time, Julius Caesar himself?

7807652,4,6300265641,"""Giulio Cesare in Egitto"" dates from Handel's greatest period as an opera composer.  For those of you who are used to hearing it sung in Italian with male or female altos in some of the key roles, e.g. Julius Caesar and Ptolemy, this 1979 Berlin State Opera version may come as a bit of surprise since the alto roles are sung by base-baritones, as is the bass role of Achillas.  Sextus, the son of Pompey and Cornelia is sung by the tenor Eberhard Buchner rather than the usual soprano. The opera is sung in German with no subtitles.
There has also been some extensive cutting, especially to the roles of Cornelia and her son Sextus.
However, it is an interesting and enjoyable production - much more so than the only other ""Giulio Cesare"" video that I have seen, i.e. the Peter Sellars modern dress version (issued by PolyGram Video). For those of us who can't make it to New York any time soon, I am hoping for a video version of the ""Giulio Cesare"" that Jennifer Larmore is currently singing.  I have the Harmonia Mundi (HMC 901385.87) 3 CD recording where Larmore sings the title role.  This production was conducted by Rene Jacobs, and all of the voices are truly Handelian, and truly ravishing.",978220800,,1200,4.593457943925234
