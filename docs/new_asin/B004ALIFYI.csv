4309916,5,B004ALIFYI,"I'm from Pittsburgh and and have seen Billy live over 10 times.  I've been a fan of his since he was on Lucky.  I love this guy and was at both shows for the taping of this special.  Yes I'm biased but he is one of the funniest guys I've ever seen.  He's awesome in person too.  It's nice to see a hometown boy make it big.  But in all honesty, this is a great comedy special.",1296864000,5,376,3.8181818181818183

4309923,5,B004ALIFYI,"Billy Gardell is an underrated stand up performer. His material is relatable and uproarious. His comedic timing is on point and he laughs are nonstop. Theres a genuine sincerity in his observations on family, blue collar living, and dealing with the realities of middle age and the road ahead. Definitely a great pick up for anyone looking for a solid hour of comedy",1476921600,,366,4.825396825396825
4309924,5,B004ALIFYI,"I came across this concert one night watching TV. I laughed out loud for
over half the concert, which is a lot for me. This is one of the funniest
shows I've seen in awhile. I was not a fan of his TV show, but I ordered

4309938,5,B004ALIFYI,"I'm a huge stand-up fan, I've listened to a ton of it almost non-stop for a number of years now.  So trust me when I say, this special is a surprising diamond in the rough.  I had no idea who this guy was, but he absolutely kills it here.  His jokes focus heavily on mid-life observations, family life, and blue-collar wit, but even as a younger guy I really think he resonates with a wide audience with his poignant statements and patented delivery.  If you're a fan of stand-up, or you're middle-aged or above, or you come from a working-class family, you can't miss with this guy.

........Here's the craziest part: I'm a Clevelander. He's a Pittsburgh fan!  That ought to tell you something, that I took the time to even write this!",1433635200,,736,4.496240601503759

4309957,5,B004ALIFYI,"A Comedy Central special, ""Halftime"" is a fun time. Gardell has remarked that, among others, comedian Jackie Gleason was an early influence.  Well, you'll see a little ""Ralph Kramden"" here and there in this show.  I love Billy's take on life and what is ultimately important.  Here's hoping that Gardell and the good people at Comedy Central produce another special and soon.",1410998400,,375,5.016129032258065

4309967,5,B004ALIFYI,We first discovered Billy Gardell and Mike and Molly. My husband got tickets for us to see his live stand up and we honestly didn't stop laughing the whole time! I can right home and ordered this DVD and everyone in my family fell in love with him too. It isn't easy to please 7 different people ages 11-67 but this routine did just that!,1374796800,,338,4.2153846153846155
4309968,5,B004ALIFYI,"This is an absolutely hilarious DVD. I would love it if there were more standup performances to purchase of Billy since he's terrific at it, but this seems to be the only DVD available. I also adore his performances on the TV comedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mike-Molly/dp/B003UD7JAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mike & Molly</a>.",1371254400,,378,6.895833333333333

DVD is in excellent quality and I haved watched it many times.",1368316800,,150,3.71875
4309971,5,B004ALIFYI,"I start to laugh as soon as I see him (and I mean that in a good way!)  He talks about things that everyone can relate to, and makes life and its issues easy to deal with, since he makes you laugh at them.  I started the DVD, and felt like I was having a beer with a lifelong friend and talking about the day.  The next thing I knew, the show was over and I was totally energized.  He is magic!",1365897600,,394,3.768292682926829

4309976,5,B004ALIFYI,I purchased this DVD after watching it on Netflix. Billy Gardell is hilarious in my opinion. While he does use profanity - it is not excessive.  Every other word out of his mouth is NOT the f... bomb which is NOT funny to me. He relies on experiences most people can relate to and makes them funny. I am very pleased with the DVD and can't wait for him to do another because he is that good. I think he has a very long career ahead of him. Buy it - you wont' regret it.,1350172800,,469,3.9368421052631577

Great adult laughs after the kids are asleep.",1324944000,,406,4.5
4309979,5,B004ALIFYI,"'Billy Gardell' Halftime is one of those rare stand up routines that maintains a certain level of hilarity throughout. Where many comedians seem to have high peaks  combined with long drawn out bits used as filler in the middle of their acts, Gardell remains consistent and keeps this excellent set running on all cylinders. Another plus is that the comedian doesn't use profanity excessively, but don't think this is a family affair, the jokes are aimed at adults.",1313625600,3,465,4.961538461538462

4309982,5,B004ALIFYI,This comedian is quick with the punchlines!  He is hysterical.  Don't miss a chance to see this DVD!,1306195200,,100,4.5
4309983,5,B004ALIFYI,"If you've seen him on ""Mike and Molly"" you know what perfect comedic timing Billy Gardell has!  His story about the dog protecting the little boy made me laugh so hard I cried!  This DVD finds Billy in front of his hometown crowd!  Very funny addition to your DVD collection and makes an awesome gift!",1305158400,,301,4.4363636363636365
4309984,5,B004ALIFYI,I saw this special on Comedy Central and had to get the DVD to see what didn't make the cut. There's about 20+ minutes more than there was on the TV show. Absolutely roaringly funny -- my husband and I laughed until we cried.,1302480000,,225,4.136363636363637

4309988,5,B004ALIFYI,"I watch a lot of comedians. There are as many different points of view as there are comics. Billy captures the normal American person and family. He is middle America. All Americans can relate to his stories of growing up, finding a wife, starting a family and dealing with relatives. Billy is you and me, but presents himself with such humor and openness that you laugh all the way through this DVD. I cannot recommend Halftime enough. Buy it.",1299715200,4,444,4.632911392405063
4309989,5,B004ALIFYI,This has to be the BEST comedy video that I've ever seen hands down.  I've watched it 3 times and I still laugh at every joke.

4309991,5,B004ALIFYI,"If you have ever seen Billy do standup and enjoy his humor you will for sure enjoy ""HALFTIME"". If you have never seen Billy then you are in for an extra special treat. Billy is so down to earth, real and truthful with his comedy, both standup and with the many cast of charcacters he has played in the past. Mike and Molly for sure is the BEST. Check that out too, Monday nights, 9:30pm, ch 4.
