4651604,3,B005C6BGT6,"Baby Jane? is a faithful homage/remake to the classic Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?, which starred Bettie Davis and Joan Crawford. But if you ask me, it's a little too faithful. Most of the cast members are men in drag, and there are a few laughs to be had, but I expected this to be funnier and more outrageous. The actors were all great and I especially had fun watching the nosy neighbors. It was just too average, overall.",1317168000,7,428,4.430379746835443
4651605,5,B005C6BGT6,"Brilliant!!! Brilliant!!! Brilliant!!!

I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this DVD.  I can hardly believe I have a copy after all this time waiting for it to come out.

Let's start with the film itself.  Matthew Martin is amazing (as always).  Can we please digitally replace Julia Roberts in every film with him playing Baby Jane?  It would be so much better.  I might be able to sit through ""Pretty Woman"", after all.  The acting is top-notch camp, played completely seriously.  The supporting cast are all good.  The script, although very close to the original, is changed enough to be a wonderful homage.

Although I LOVE the original, the cinematography of this version far exceeds the original.  The house is more beautiful, more gothic, more disturbing.  The imagery looks very similar to ""Swoon"", except with men in dresses.  The direction is also excellent.  Obviously a labor of love.  It shows.

Now the ""extras"":  Fascinating commentary....alternate ending...deleted scenes....trailer.  All wonderful.  The real treasure, however, are the ""Moment with Bette"" clips that have been on YouTube.  They are WONDERFUL....especially the cooking show.  SOOOOO funny!

I hope this DVD does really well so that we can get a ""Hush Up Sweet Charlotte"" sequel.  My partner and I flew to San Francisco twice to see that show, and it was amazing.  Mathew Martin and Varla Jean, please, please, please.",1312934400,15,1401,5.066079295154185

4651607,5,B005C6BGT6,"To really understand this movie you'd need to have prior knowledge of Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, and the original movie Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. This movie makes fun of all the above. For example: (1) in this film the bird's name is Vita, this is also the daughter's name in the Crawford movie ""Mildred Pierce."" (2) In the original  Whatever Happened to Baby Jane film, during the movie review scene, the director had used real footage from a Bette Davis film. In this movie version, they dressed up the actor, and made fun of several Bette Davis Movies (such as All About Eve). (3) In the original the first time you see Crawford is in the room, watching one of her old movies (a real Crawford movie form her earlier years). In this movie, they did a spoof of ""Mommy Dearest"", a 1980's movie based on Joan Crawford, and her daughter. (4) In this movie Blanch talks about how she misses the designer clothes by Adrian. Adrian was a top fashion designer for MGM, and had designed several of Crawford's dresses.
If you are aware of these subtle jokes then this movie is even funnier to watch. If you are not, then the movie still has funny moments that all audience members will enjoy, example: (1) the actor playing Jane, while driving, says ""d- -n women drivers"", this is a joke reminding the audience that this is really a man in drag. (2) In the original movie the pianist's name was Edwin Flag, in this version it is f - g.""
The beginning of the movie started off strong, with a lot of funny jokes/references. However, the middle of the film seemed to lag, and was not as funny. Towards the end the film's jokes picked up again, and regained my interest.
This film is really for those of us who loved the original WTBJ, Bette Davis, and Joan Crawford. However, if you have no prior knowledge of these actresses, at least watch the original WTBJ film....enjoy.",1395878400,7,1870,4.5325443786982245
4651608,2,B005C6BGT6,"If you haven't guessed already, this is a parody of WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE in which most of the characters are played by drag queens. It was expensive, but I bought one anyway because I figured I might not see another copy and I had to see this film just once.

It's ambitious, to be sure. Obviously made on a shoe string or (ankle strap) budget, this film tries to duplicate the look of the original with locations, set pieces, camera angles and lighting that mimic the original. The best attempt is made by the costume designer who successfully recreates the Academy Award nominated originals worn by Bette and Joan from 50 years ago.

Leaving Jane and Blanche for a moment, we get to the supporting cast who either make no attempt to look or sound like the originals or else fail in their attempts. Take your pick. The Ladylike next door neighbor Mrs. Bates, played in the original by pretty Anna Lee, is played here by an ugly drag queen in a vinyl birdsnest of a wig. The daughter, played by B.D. Merrill (Bette's daughter) in the original is played by a nondescript and uninteresting drag queen. How much better if this character had been played by B.D. as she appears now, fat and slovenly, or else a drag queen imitating these qualities.

Elvira, beautifully played in the original movie by the attractive Maidie Norman is now played by a black woman (not a drag queen) with a huge teased bouffant and amply padded hips and behind. This is not funny because the actress playing this part is actually pretty and the padding is obvious.

The only two performance that matter are the actors playing Bette and Joan. The Joan Crawford drag queen is a poor actor/actress.

The film's one saving grace is the actor/actress playing Bette Davis. He has obviously seen this film about a million times and delivers all the dialogue just as Bette did, right down to the inflections in his voice. But He's playing it straight. The problem is, it's not funny. Some of the dialogue, especially near the beginning of the film, has been re-written for laughs. This is the direction they should have taken all the way through.

See this for Bette's performance but don't pay all this money for it. Try to find it on You Tube or something.

BABY JANE is rather like that remake of Psycho years back. It's pointless.

Besides, if it's camp you want to see, what could be better than the real Bette and Joan in the original WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?",1376265600,3,2451,4.579908675799087
4651609,5,B005C6BGT6,"This movie is just wonderful.  If you are a fan of the original, you will adore this brilliant send up by Billy Clift.  Starring Matthew Martin as the washed up and frazzled Baby Jane and J. Conrad Frank as the wheel~chair confined, yet still elegant, Joan, the movie draws you in and keeps you laughing, without any let~up.

The entire cast is brilliant and they all give their most to their characters.  Keklina, as the next snoopy next door neighbor, Mrs. Bates (cousin to the notorious 'Norman') and Lotta Boutte as the irrepressible, Elvira, and Mike Finn, as the opportunistic Edwin, are all standouts.

This was a movie I saw and loved on Netflix, and once it was no longer carried on the streaming channel, I decided I just had to have a copy for myself.

Don't let this movie get away.  Once you see it you will want to own a copy to play for your friends.",1375228800,3,865,4.436708860759493
4651610,4,B005C6BGT6,"I had seen the movie at a friend's house and had enjoyed it greatly. Just as one can watch ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" several times a year, one can continue to discover facets in this parody such as the address of the Hudson sisters' house is given in the parody, but not in the original. Fans of ""that nosey Mrs. Bates"" will not be disappointed. My only regret was that an electric bell was used instead of that annoying buzzer. Famous lines are often paraphrased, probably to avoid copyright infringements, but you will still get the joke. Hello, Johnson's? I want to order some entertainment.",1365033600,3,603,4.644859813084112
4651611,2,B005C6BGT6,"I love Baby Jane. I love drag queens. Should be a match made in heaven. For me, it wasn't. I turned it off half way through. The decent portrayals kept me interested for a little while, but it started to drag(haha). I just didn't think the inserted ""modern"" jokes were that funny, nor were their caricatures good enough to carry the whole movie. I just didn't see much humor in this. The original film was campier I think! It might have been funny to just do a few scenes from different movies, but it loses its luster when you're reenacting the entire story. The joke wears thin.",1361923200,,580,4.429906542056075
4651612,5,B005C6BGT6,"This movie is a hoot! There were some scenes that had me laughing harder than I can remember laughing in years. To fully appreciate it, rent What Ever Happened to Baby Jane and watch it first, if you haven't seen it lately.",1359849600,,223,4.333333333333333

4651614,4,B005C6BGT6,"If you remember this movie, then you will be laughing your butt off. As creepy as if clowns were staring in this, this movie is great to watch with friends who are all big queens in their own right.
It would of made Batty Davis and Joan herself, proud.",1357344000,2,252,4.163265306122449
4651615,5,B005C6BGT6,"I first saw Baby Jane? at its premiere at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, and have seen it again several times since.  It's wonderful fun, and so many in the cast -- especially Matthew Martin and Mike Finn -- do such a hilarious job with it.

What could have been simply a parody that gets tiresome after awhile takes on a life of its own and is elevated to something more under the watchful eye of Billy Clift.

Mathew Martin is superb as Baby Jane, bringing both humor and poignancy to the part, but EVERYONE, even down to the audience reactions at the theatre with the young Baby Jane are hilarious if you get campy humor that pokes fun at itself while also walking a tightrope of being based in real emotion.

I anxiously awaited the DVD and am glad to own it and to see it again and again.  I am so looking forward to what Billy Clift and the cast do next.",1353974400,2,866,4.224242424242425
