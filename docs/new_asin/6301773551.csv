371725,5,6301773551,"In this movie, George Lucas picks up where Stanley Kubrick left off in Odyssey 2001. Dazzling special effects, combined with a somber story that could easily have been lifted from the pages of an Edgar Rice Burroughs  novel and great acting on the part of the characters, makes this a national  landmark. Many people criticize Lucas' refitting of the original trilogy  because he seems to be tampering with something best left alone. I  disagree. The addition of Jabba the Hutt and Luke's meeting with Biggs make  the later scenes--of Solo's imprisonment in Jabba's palace and Biggs' death  during the offensive on the Death Star--have more of a three-dimensional  feel to them. (I wish they hadn't taken the Wolfman out of the cantina  though. He was my favorite character in that scene.) As a whole, the movie  is great. What makes it even better is the effective ending where we  realize there will be at least one more confrontation with the Empire  although the Death Star has been destroyed. It would have been better  though, I think, had Peter Cushing found some way to get into the later  movies. He was the best villain in the movie with the possible exception of  Prowse's Vader. Overall, though, a great movie and one any sci-fi must  love.",920505600,,1252,4.785046728971962

There are a few different versions of the unaltered trilogy on DVD, so I say unto the, O mighty Star Wars Purists, get one of those trilogies and enjoy, but get these on Blu-ray too. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
If you're a die hard Star Wars lover like me, its definitely worth having the Steel book Blu-ray Special Editions and the DVD versions of the original trilogy as I do.

371895,5,6301773551,"Those of us that saw Star Wars in theaters in 1977 were in awe. I myself went to see it fourteen times. There wasn't New Hope or a number associated with it and the changes in special effects came later too. It was a little frustrating buying a modified copy every few years. George Lucas brought a magic to the screen no one had seen in SciFi before with the first movie. It was a world we could believe in and want to visit or live. The characters were good, evil, and roguish. It was adventure, drama, romance, and comedy in rolled into a delightful fairytale story of a distant place in another time. It will always be my favorite. I enjoy all those that came after, but the first three (now  IV-VI) were special to me. I was a young man about Luke's age then. And now as they kill off those characters and the hope they represented, a part of me passes as well. So with new hope and loss of the first beginning, let's hope it's a new beginning.",1521676800,,949,4.214285714285714

The first time was when it first came out and as a ten year old, it was just fantastic. Forty years on and even with a few tweaks and new scenes, I have to say it is not as brilliant as I used to think. It is surprising how cliched some of the lines are and the acting of Hamill in particular is no great shakes. Even the great battle scenes seemed slow and clunky. A few scenes even had the look of old Dr Who episodes. The aliens in particular are so clearly puppets. It doesnt change that it was magical first time round but it has dated in its look. It was always just meant to be visually entertaining, so I was not expecting Dead Poet Society but I was disappointed for my son. This said, he liked it. Though hilariously, when Darth Vader first appeared from the smoke of battle  he cheered! Things change. As always, stories, even great ones, need updating for new generations.

My 4K Blu Ray player automatically upscales the picture quality (which is crystal clear when I play the DVD) and the Pioneer surround receiver provides perfect movie sound, even though the OTR is in 2.0.  My only complaint is that the wide screen image doesn't fill the entire width of the T.V.  I probably have about 3/4's of the screen filled.  That's just fine on a 60"" LED/LCD.

Star Wars: A New Hope. I think that in the all the directions this series will take, I will always think A New Hope is the best Star Wars movie.
Throughout all the entires, the story takes many twists and turns, it always comes back to this one.

There are a infinite amount of things that have been said about this film, and I honestly feel like there is a still a lot to be said, and discovered.
This film itself is a phenomenon for many different reasons. I think ultimately this is a story about life. People can relate to the story and it was also done extremely well. The attention to detail is genius. A New Hope is a well done Space Opera.

In brief, the story involved an evil empire controlled by a dark force, a princess, and a small but hopeful group of rebels that
are determined to save the galaxy. This film includes classic introductions to some of the most iconic names in film: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, Chewbacca. and the list goes on. This is where it started.

I don't mind if the production company wants to take editing floor material and reinsert it into the film.  After all, everybody already knows who's who and what's going to happen.  Extra shots can add backstory or context and they do that here, to some extent.  The problem is that the original movie was done with traditional film but someone decided to add new digital material with CGI.  Now you have a huge difference in film quality and every time ""enhanced"" footage is added, it looks completely fake and totally unlifelike.  To be fair, there are sequences that have been added from old footage, sequences that add to character development and overall plot.  They don't in any way alter anything major but they fit in smoothly and I welcome them.  But digitally inserting characters and creatures into an analog feature is an amateur manoeuvre for which the consumer should not foot the bill.",1492300800,23,1001,4.77906976744186

My  husband watched some of the film with me and explained what was going on between the various characters involving Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher),  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) and other various character portrayals featured in the film. One scene that stood in my mind was how Skywalker pretty much forced into fighting early on in the film, and how his destiny became intertwined with Princess Leia and Han Solo after Obi Wan Kenobi (Alex Guiness) took Skywalker under his wing.  I have to credit my husband for getting me interested in Star Wars and the aspiring writer in me is glad to have purchased the film (due to the information I can glean from creative plot sequences).",1492128000,,835,4.744827586206896

Well, it turns out that was foolish of me. I wanted the original Star Wars, but apparently amazon.com doesn't carry that. This is the ""digitally remastered"" (should be called ""digitally f-d up"") version and it shows. The gritty quality of the original movie has been cleaned up and now it looks more like a cgi movie made by a bunch of high school students. Also, scenes have been altered - why?!?!? Why would you mess with perfection? Why would you take a movie that has a fan base greater than any other movie - and tamper with it?

If anyone knows how or where I can get hold of the ORIGINAL Star Wars movies, I would be so grateful if you'd share the secret. I haven't bothered to buy the other two movies as I know they'll just raise my blood pressure.",1490486400,2,929,4.213483146067416

373150,5,6301773551,"What else can there be said about this galactic masterpiece which has not already been said? Now in times where the saga is (hopefully) complete, ""Star Wars"" still stands out as one of the most important movies of the film history.

Even though some dialogs may be silly (but memorable nevertheless) and in spite of several logical mistakes, George Lucas' Science-Fiction-film can easily be considered as one of the most entertaining works ever. The spectator is introduced in a universe full of fantastic concepts and locations and meets there some archetypal characters, such as the beautiful and innocent princess, the keen, naive hero, the dark, evil villain, the wise, old man, etc. The mixture of fairy tale and western elements is extremely fascinating and seems almost perfect. Lucas' direction is so skillful that even the above mentioned drawbacks eventually appear as positive characteristics of this space odyssey.

No matter its meantime rather bad reputation, ""Star Wars"" is and will always remain one of the most magical cinematic experiences you can make. It is one of those movies you would like to talk about hours and hours, but which after all cannot be taken into words.",1484179200,3,1191,5.102564102564102

373302,5,6301773551,"I saw it when it first came out, and it's still one of the top 10 best movies ever made in my opinion.
Possibly the best one.
It was made back when movies were made to entertain.
These, days movies and TV shows are made to promote political correctness in one way or another.
And striving for entertainment value comes as a distant second to promoting political correctness.
Part of that, is today's rejection of any idea of good vs bad.
Now you can't have any real good guys vs bad guys.
They all have to be conflicted and/or mixtures of good and bad.
But back in the day, it was heros vs villains and it was fun to watch.
Did that make a bit simplistic?
I suppose.
But that is not what I felt I had to 'suspend my disbelief in', in order to enjoy the movie.
It was just simple fun and everything I liked about a movie, especially since it was excellent science fiction  (well, a science fiction and fantasy combination, anyway).",1483574400,,930,4.314285714285714

You get the analogy.  Comparing it to what can be done today is unfair.  But without this episode and the innovations of George Lucas and Industrial Light and Magic, today's movies in this genre don't happen.  So I don't discount for story, acting, or the fact that I can see the mid 70s in every hair style of the Empire or of the Resistance.  It is perfect to me as is and it lays the foundational roots for the prequels and the remainder of the series.

In the original, Han Solo shoots Greedo in the Cantina after Greedo gives him sh*t. In this version, Lucas superimposed a poorly aligned blast from Greedo to Han, making it appear that Greedo shot first and Han responded in defense.... not only is it very easy to tell that the ""Greedo blast"" did NOT come from Greedo's blaster, but it wrecks the original impression the audience draws for Han. He is a ""space pirate""/smuggler that has made a life shooting first and asking questions later. This BS is contrary to the character which was engrained in the minds of fans for decades. It is right along the same lines as Spielberg erasing the FBI agent's guns and replacing them with radios when he ""remastered""/raped ET a few years back.

373900,4,6301773551,"Steel Box Edition:
If you already have the previous 2015 bluray edition/trilogy 1 or 2 etc. - then you really don't need this.  I have yet to upgraded from the DVD prequils or the originals.  I purchased all six at Walmart ($12 each, Dec 2016).  Each are in a collectable 'stand-alone' limited steel box.  No paperwork, booklet or the likes.  Just commentates.  I recommend this if you (1) haven't upgraded from the DVD, (2) want the steel box collectable edition, or haven't got any of the previous media releases.  Each steel box is essentially bare-bones.  I would have purchased the 2015 box release, if this was more than $12-each.
My take:
- Picture quality 4/5:  Definitely an improvement from the earlier DVD edition.  Some scenes are a bit fuzzy non 1080p/2K - and some are just darn-right 'crisp' - especially the scenes in the Mallinium-Falcon.  You can feel the cracked-leather seats!
- Sound 3.5/5.  The first 15 minutes, the sound was predominately on the right-channel - a bit irritating.
- Packaging 4/5.  nice box and graphics.  No booklet WTF!
- Movie 4/5. This includes the controversial Lucas updates which polarizes fans.  No option for the theatrical version... Enough said!",1482105600,,1196,4.939698492462312

It was a lot better suited for DVD release.  Its still a great movie and definitely worth watching!

The picture for being a movie from 1977 is definitely great!  The pictures color is bright and the sound is great!!

Hes not into so much how new and HD but more about the plot and the storyline!  This being the first he really enjoyed it!

374815,1,6301773551,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

374972,5,6301773551,"The original trilogy... That is why most of us own these versions of the dvds in the first place. The OT may not be in anamorphic, but its here on dvd to watch without having to worry about laserdisc or vhs. Buy this set only if you have a tv with picture height adjustment. Your tv should be able to stretch the image vertical. If it does, take an anamorphic movie that has the same aspect ratio as Star Wars and mark where the black lines are. Then put in the OT disc and stretch the picture till the black lines match your markings. And there you have it. The OT in all its widescreen glory without the 2004 and beyond changes. The picture of course is old and gritty, but thats how the OT should look anyways just like the old vhs I had 22 yrs ago.

Now, every so often I'll put the 2006 disc in if I don't mind watching the changes. I actually don't mind any changes on this version of ANH. Empire, I cant stand the Emperor or Bobba Fett changes. And Jedi, forget it. Hayden kills the whole movie for me. That was Lucas's biggest, dumbest ****** move right there. Thank goodness I can pop in the OT and not have to worry about any changes.

Even though I would like to have the UOT on blu-ray, Im perfectly happy with stretching the image to get my Star Wars fix. Is it worth getting at these prices? Only you can answer that. These movies are worth what you are willing to pay for them.",1463702400,,1392,4.151851851851852

375053,5,6301773551,"So this review is for the Limited Edition 2 disc dvd version of Star Wars, not the regular 2004? I believe, Special Edition version which is included but we all know and don't love. Make sure since the reviews are all mashed together if you are looking to get the limited edition with the bonus disc that it does contain the original 1977 theatrical release of Star Wars. It has a different cover art and says Limited Edition in gold on the top right under either full screen or widescreen and on the back it has a list of the stuff on disc one and the bonus disc that has the 1977 version of the film. Yes you heard me right the *ORIGINAL 1977 Star Wars not the Greedo shooting first, Rhonto Dewback infested, different alien cantina, bad cg Jabba, etc. special edition. Now many say the quality is bad but given limited options to get the theatrical release of Star Wars I was willing to do it. Honestly its not as bad as I feared, yes the special edition dvd looks much better and obviously the blu ray does too. But its better quality than VHS and I personally was willing to substitute a bit of video quality for the Star Wars I grew up with. It's not that bad like I said given limited options and until hopefully Disney graces us with a remastered original trilogy. Its one of your only options and for $20-$30 bucks I feel its worth it. Above that price is, for me at least, pushing it. So I hope that helps some of the super fans that are looking for the 1977 theatrical release of Star Wars like I was.

375204,1,6301773551,"Greatest piece of cinematic mythology ever created - but,

I have to add my protest one-star vote to the chorus of people who lament the updating of this classic.  I also have to send a glass of one-star juice to the Zon for not including the non-anamorphic 1977 print that apparently comes with the DVD version, but not the on-line streaming version.  Instead, we get a 54 minute documentary which spends a great deal of time on the reshooting of a scene for the updated version where they actually had to go back and find original plates to get the CGI right for the added material.

My became even more angry when George himself extols the virtues of his background as an editor which compelled him to save everything.  So that means that all of the original material for the 1977 footage does exist!  And it's not hard to add in - as evidenced by two scenes: first the scene with Jaba.  The original plate was from the 1977 version.  Then, there's the scene with Biggs before the battle.  Also from 1977 original footage.  So when these people lie to our faces about how it would be too much trouble to release the original, I get even angrier.

Many people have criticized the ongoing revision of this movie far better than I can, so let me just say, me too.  I really wish I could watch the movie I saw in the El Morro theater in Gallup New Mexico in 1977.  This isn't it.

Thank God he didn't make Rollerball  or Logan's Run.",1461974400,,1432,4.391634980988593

This the next step in my quest to watch all six, for me, the prequels were an essential part of the story filling in the
gaps and the background leading up to the original stories.
MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU
Almost two decades have past since the rise of the Empire and the demise of the Jedi....
'Princess Leia' (Carrie Fisher) figurehead of the rebel forces is on her way to consult with the council however her vessel is
intercepted by the Dark-Lord (David Prowse) and his forces aware that plans for their 'Death Star' the most powerful weapon
in the universe have fallen into the hands of the rebels and are believed to be on-board the ship they have captured.
R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-390 (Anthony Daniels) have used a pod to escape now find themselves on 'Tatooine' where after
being captured by the Sand People they are sold-on to a farmer who with his wife care for 'Luke Skywalker' (Mark Hamill)
who befriends the Droids.
Also living on the planet as a recluse these days 'Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi' (Alec Guinness) who 'Luke' and the Droids happen upon
'Kenobi' of course knows 'Luke's' roots and offers to show the young man the ways of the Jedi.
'Kenobi' learns of the plight of 'Princess Leia' and knows he must try and rescue her with the help of young 'Luke' though they
have no ship, which at the right price is where the 'cocky 'Han Solo' (Harrison Ford) and his side-kick 'Chewbacca' (Peter Mahew)
come into play.
'Luke Skywalker' is about to embark upon his first mission with the help of his new friends to rescue the Princess.......
'Kenobi' will come face to face with his old friend 'Anakin' (now Darth Vader the Dark Lord) for the first time in nearly 20 years...
With the battle yet to come...
I'm sure many like myself ahead of the Blu-ray/ DVD release of 'The Force Awakens' are on a similar journey to myself, though,
for me this is the first time i have tried to watch all six as a series over a fairly short period of time, must say watching them like
this has to date been an enjoyable journey.
This, now listed at the fourth has plenty of action along the way and given the fact that this was first seen on the silver-screen
back in 1977 the special-effects are actually pretty good.

A small band of rebels led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) dares to fight back and steals the secret plans for the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, capable of destroying an entire planet. Pursued by an Imperial Battlecruiser, known as a Stardestroyer, Leia is capture. However, before being taken prisoner, Leia put the secret plans into the robot droid R2-D2 which escaped with fellow droid C-3PO to the desert planet of Tatooine where the plans are recovered by young farm boy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the wise old Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Luke and Obi-Wan, together with swash-buckling space smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his trusted sidekick Chewbacca, launch a daring mission to rescue the princess and to destroy the Death Star. Obi-Wan also fights the evil Darth Vader in an exciting lightsaber duel.

This review is specifically about the SEPTEMBER 12, 2006 EDITION.

Scroll down for a quick summation and the details of review.
_______________________________________________________

The original Star Wars is awesome.  We all know that.  Classic.

We all know that Lucas went back and made ""improvements.""  We all know that these changes are terrible.

We all know Greedo did not shoot first and that Lucas' revision of the scene runs exactly counter to the Han Solo character. He's not a moral, ethical guy when the story starts.  He's a lone wolf.  He takes care of #1 and that's it.  Which is why Han Solo's late decision to risk his life for his friends and the rebel cause is so dramatic and powerful.  Anyway, no need to get too deep into this.

So here is where my review starts.

This 2006 edition DOES include the original theatrical version.  It's a terrible transfer.  It's grainy.  It's not full frame.  It looks ugly.

The problem here is ... young people being introduced to Star Wars for the first time are very unlikely going to want to watch the original theatrical version.  The transfer makes it look like it's a 100 years old.  So must people (and importantly the kids) are going to watch the ""restored"" version.

The ""restored"" version does look great.  It's not anamorphic and that's another slam against Lucas.  (Why, why, why can't he simply do a great, clean restore of the original theatrical version???)

But ... despite not being anamorphic ... the restored version looks pretty damn good.

So my concern is people will opt to watch the restored version, not the theatrical.  Meaning a ton of kids are going to see the WRONG version of the Solo/Greedo scene.

Too many kids have no idea the history behind this scene and Harrison Ford's character.  After watching the newest chapter in the theaters, my daughter wanted to see the original again (she had been 4 when she first watched it and didn't remember anything.)

I obviously wanted her to see the original, but after watching a few seconds of the terrible transfer of the theatrical, we opted to go with the new, glossy ""restored"" version and I would point out the new enhancements.  All went well until the Solo/Greedo scene.  My daughter hated all the stupid enhanced CGI scenes (the Jabba scene in the hangar is viciously awful), but after I showed her the original Solo/Greedo scene later ... she said she couldn't get the ""restored"" version ""out of her head.""  In other words, the version where Greedo shoots first had imprinted on her since she saw it that way first.  Despite going back to watch how Han originally shot Greedo first, it had little impact for her.

So if you have kids who are young enough to be coming to the Star Wars films for the first time ... AND ... you are thoughtful Star Wars fan who wants to raise their children the right way ... you are going to want to show them the THEATRICAL version FIRST.

This 2006 edition is one of the very few options you have to get your hands on the original theatrical version.  It's a crappy transfer.  But it's there.  And it's the original.  Make your kids watch the crappy transfer version first.  DO NOT let them view the glossy ""restored"" version first.  It is that important.

SUMMATION
___________

1)  This is a review of the Sept 12 2006 DVD edition.

2)  Star Wars IV is a classic film and the progenitor of the enormous cultural phenomenon.

3)  This DVD edition contains a beautifully ""restored"" transfer -- but also contains the controversial, widely criticized ""enhancements.""  Despite these controversial enhancements, this ""restored"" version looks GREAT.  5 stars for the transfer.  -1 star for the enhancements.

4)  This DVD edition DOES include the original THEATRICAL version.  But the transfer is terrible.  Not even full-screen.  HOWEVER, this DVD edition is one of the VERY FEW ways people can get a chance to see the original 1977 version.  5 stars for the inclusion of the original theatrical version and -4 stars for the horrible transfer.

5)  All Star Wars fans have an obligation to make sure they have seen the original theatrical version at some point in their lives.

6)  Parents of young children have a RESPONSIBILITY to make sure their kids are introduced to the Star Wars world and characters in the appropriate manner.  GEORGE LUCAS is WRONG.  Han Solo shooting Greedo first was one of the greatest character introductions in movie history.  In that moment, Han Solo became one of the most interesting movie characters ever.  A true anti-hero.  And it set up the stakes for what happens later in the story ... when the future of the galaxy is in jeopardy ... the self-centered, unethical mercenary decides to help his friends and help the rebel cause.  It is vital that children are educated and exposed to the enormous mistakes made by George Lucas.

Teaching kids early about the horrible decisions Lucas made in ""restoring"" the original ... will help them understand how it was that this grand, wonderful movie franchise managed to produce and release the boring-as-tears middle three films.

It was an awful, horrible mistake.

375860,4,6301773551,"The original Star Wars is hands-down one of the most amazing films ever made. Wonderful story, acting, special effects and music, of course, but at it's core it's a fun film with a lot of heart, built around strong character development and a compelling plot. If you watch this after viewing the computer-effect overloaded prequel films this is like a calm walk in the park, with so much focus on the believably of the characters. It's an amazing film, completely rewatchable with clearly defined themes of good and evil. No heavy mental lifting involved, just a great adventure story ideal for all ages.

The ""special edition"" effects are frustrating, and that's all that keeps this review from being 5 stars. To see the goofy CGI additions (and not just the modified Greedo scene, but things like the dinosaur-creature in Mos Eisley) just distracts in the worst way. I watched this with my kids and they, seeing it for the first time, immediately noticed the CG additions and pointed out how stupid they looked. It feels like someone painting modern clothing over characters in a Rembrandt painting - it just looks and feels completely wrong, and more than that, unnecessary. The Jabba sequences are the worst and are cringe-worthy at how bad they are as Harrison Ford walks around and talks to an animation. Lucas should have just cleaned up the original film and left well enough alone.",1453939200,,1390,4.864978902953586

376040,1,6301773551,"Imagine that you intend to serve your party guests a delicious punch that you covet, a punch crafted by renowned artisans who are famous for its production.  Unbeknownst to you however, one of the artisans decided to alter the punch recipe.  You serve it to your guests who, along with yourself are at once perplexed and revolted by the awful taste of the punch.  You find out - with no help from the label or the salesman, mind you - why it tasted so different and awful: The artisan in question thought it wise to swirl a small turd around in the punch during various stages of the recipe, intermingling the brew with a not-so-subtle earthy turd flavor. That is essentially what happened with this film and it went over about as well as you would expect that a turd in a punchbowl would go over.  Sure, there are some whose palates aren't as nuanced as others and they take no issue with the changes to the film, but its quite another matter if you have a nose for the original

The repugnance of this re-release cannot be understated; its addition of new computer-generated imagery is distracting and loathsome.  In my opinion, the '97 re-release should be considered an affront to the craftspeople whose artistic contributions to the original production distinguished the film as a culturally and historically significant piece of art.  I am not sure why or how this film is marketed as the original, but it is most certainly not the original!",1453161600,15,1447,4.673228346456693

376062,5,6301773551,"Like so many people I was one of so many that got to have the wonderful pleasure of having this hit, work of genius as a part of my childhood.  As this movie came out a little before I was born, I still had the wonderful pleasure of seeing it and catching up with it when I was a child.  As a result, I was immediately hooked as as well as highly eager to see the sequels as soon as I could.  Needless to say, they all became one of those special kinds of experiences that my childhood wouldn't have been as awesome without.  This movie as well as its 2 sequels have influenced and inspired so many parodies and references from tv shows to movies(for example, Family Guy, Robot Chicken, Spaceballs, The Simpsons, Clerks(1994 movie), Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure(1989 movie), Tiny Toon Adventures, That 70's Show, countless tv commercials, etc.).  There was also the much reviled Star Wars Christmas Special from 1978.  This movie alone gave Sci-Fi just the push in a new and influential direction that the genre truly needed.  The merchandise has always been a strong force(no pun intended) to bring this masterpiece further into our ever-growing pop culture.  Things like action figures and accesories, coloring books, children's story books, comic books, t-shirts, video games, breakfast cereals, toy light sabres and blasters, blankets and coverlets, bedsheets, conventions, coffee mugs, etc. have been a long time added bonus and testament to the greatness of this movie and the franchise in general.  To this very day the merchandise, parodies, references, and influence of this franchise in general, are all great things that we still get to enjoy to very day and show no sign of slowing down and let's hope that they never go away.  What's especially great about this series is that it's loved by all ages.  It's one of the few series' that brings grown ups and kids together.

This reviews features spoilers.  If you're a newbie then you might not want to read this.

Some Facts About The Movie:  It was written and directed both by George Lucas, produced by Gary Kurtz, distributed by 20th Century Fox, released on May 25, 1977, it's budget was $11,000,000, and it grossed $775,000,000 worldwide.

What proves so brilliant and even edgy about this movie is: It's special effects and designs were brilliant and unique for its time.  I'll have to admit that I have definitely had never seen special effects this genius in any previous Sci-Fi efforts.  The special effects for the blasters when they fire their lasers, the light sabres with their sword meets blaster look, the shots of space, the spaceships such as the X-Wings and T.I.E. Fighters were beyond anything that had been done before, the lasers and bombs that they fired were great effects, the Death Star was the ultimate with its super awesome multi-laser firing capabilities was quite cutting edge, who's ever seen or heard of a huge space armada that has the capability to blow up an entire planet before?  That's so original and brilliant both.  The props used for the inside of the spaceships, inside of buildings, shots of space, and the weapons, all look so real even to this day. The animatronics and costumes are really cool and unique.  The planets were very real feeling as well, to where you actual feel as though you could visit them in real life.  The cinematography for them was beautifully done and gives you a  pretty good idea of what life must be like on them to some degree.

The characters whether you're talking about the villains or the heroes are all fun, well developed/three dimensional, relatable, interesting, funny at times, exciting, and best of all their not all alike.  Luke Skywalker is a simple down-to-earth young man of whom has dreams of joining the academy and fighting the Galactic Empire.  Han Solo is a cool and very focused yet cynical smuggler and fighter pilot.  He's at times selfish and rough around the edges, but he still manages to be a likable character all the same.  Chewbacca aka Chewie is a big hairy Wookiee who's a very loyal friend and for the most part is sweet and lovable.  If someone rubs him the wrong way Chewie can get mean.  C-3PO is an incredibly loyal driod to humans.  He's mainly an interpreter droid and can be an annoying chatter box and worry wort at times.  He's still a commendable character for his unquestionable loyalty.  R2-D2 is a little droid that also has a sense of loyalty to humans, but he's also quite loyal to C3PO.  He can store info, interact with computers and other machines, he can also fix them too.  Both droids are quite funny especially when they argue.  While you have no idea what R2 is saying often times C-3PO plays off him so that you can get an idea.  Princess Leia is a beautiful, high class, chief member of the rebellion.  She's incredibly determined and completely loyal to the rebellion.  Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi is a veteran Jedi master.  He's old but can definitely throw down if circumstances call for it.  He's a gentle, intelligent, likable, and committed Jedi to the light side of the Force and to seeing that the Empire is crushed.  Wedge Antilles is a sophisticated rebel pilot who's very good at planning out attacks as well as knowing just how and when to pull out of a fight before he gets annihilated.  Biggs Darklighter is Luke's good friend from Tattooine who got to go to the Rebel Academy before Luke.  Finally, Darth Vader is a vicious, shrewd, malicious, cold-calculating, and mercilessly evil vice leader of the Galactic Empire.  He's also a Sith Lord for the dark side of the Force.  He tortures and probes for information.  He also has quite a deadly grip to that he uses on anyone who gets him peeved.
All of these characters are very cool and interesting for all of these reasons and they're one of the elements of this movie that make it very much worthwhile.

The spiritual and telekinetic powers of both the dark side and light side of the Force is truly fascinating.  The fact that it surrounds Jedis and Jedis in training at every moment of their lives is quite interesting.  It's like an everlasting divine power.

The action sequences involving blaster shoot outs, light sabres(the little bit they're used), the heroes dodging danger, and space ship dog fights are all perfectly exciting as well as creatively and stunningly handled.

The whole story line with Luke's dream of a more fulfilling and rewarding lifestyle proved quite engaging and also relatable.  Luke understandably felt torn between his farming duties and life with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru and his longing to find something more is also wonderfully relatable.  Luke as I see it, is the perfect example of an underdog with untapped potential who needed a chance to prove himself and happily through Obi-Wan Kenobi he finally finds his chance.  That's without a doubt a very moving element of this movie.

John Williams scores high with his brilliant, sophisticated, and all together original score for this movie.  He dared to create a beautiful and melodic score that was not common in the late 70's.  He composed this engagingly powerful score to showcase the movies excitement, sadness, and scenes of danger just perfectly.

As for this 2-disc release well, bonuses are disappointingly few, but it was definitely something to look forward to whatwith the release of the unaltered theatrical releases of this movie and its 2 sequels to finally become available on DVD.  As an added bonus you get the 1997 extended versions as well.  If you ran to the store and got the 2004 boxset than the addition of the 1997 versions would probably not seem like that big a deal.  The 1997 special editions were okay, but I prefer the unaltered versions to them.

All In All, Star Wars will always be the best Sci-Fi series ever.  Given the fun action scenes, the vicious villains, the memorable and relatable characters, the character development, the great script, the cinematography, the unique storyline, the explosive special effects, and the bold and ambitious score, make this an epic Sci-Fi movie that belongs in every Sci-Fi fans collection.  This series has transcended so many generations over the years and its brilliance shall always be noticed for plenty of time to come.",1453161600,,8250,4.809794180269694

Now I am not sure what went wrong but I thought the special effects were ordinary, the acting poor and the story particularly weak (although to be fair I remembered many of the best lines). Maybe its just the standards in such movies have improved so much since this movie came out?

In any case, I left very disappointed. This movie made history because it was so good in many ways, but those that saw it those many years ago seeing this will cannot go back to the excitement and awe it created.",1451260800,,809,4.309210526315789

BE AWARE, IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL 1977 RELEASE!

It has Greedo shooting 1st, the ridiculous CGI Jabba & the asinine animals thrown in for comic relief. We watched it last night (40+ year old parents & two kiddos). Everyone but me LOVED IT!

Like many, I grew up in a theatre watching the originals, I was pissed watching this thinking it was the real 1977 release. Even though the end credits gave a 1997 copyright, there is NOTHING to tell you that this is NOT the 1977 release before you buy it. The title even has 1977 next to it!

As one of the commenters mentioned, you can find Harmy's Despecialized Edition if you google it. While it will require some tech know how (your kids can help) & you will need to buy the BlueRay version, it is definitely worth it. 1000%!

I am sorry for not updating this review sooner. I found Harmy's Despecialized Edition a couple of days after watching this POS version, and I redid Star Wars night for the family & friends, And they were all BLOW AWAY!!!!!

For those of you who saw the original in the theatre, watching Harmy's version will take you back to gas lines, corduroy, & economic malaise. For the younger generation they will love it because it is all real. And  it is AWESOME! No CGI.

Goodluck!",1450828800,27,1634,4.905454545454545

Unfortunately, the packaging in no way indicates which version of the film is contained within, and it was only after buying it I realised it is the 'special edition' version. I feel ripped off.

This version might look good but it brings absolutely nothing new, and certainly does not serve the customer well by foisting yet another release of the much maligned remastered version, which basically took a great film -one of the best - and ruined it.

376730,4,6301773551,"I have an LG 65UB9500 4K UHD LED TV, a Samsung BD-H6500 3D Blue-ray player with 4K upscaling.  I bought the 2 disk version (Sep-12 2006 release)  Widescreen Limited Edition.  When I got married in 2001, I gained access to a VHS Limited Edition set.  I say the original version a number of times, once in Des Moines, Iowa, in the front row of a huge Panavision theater with a curved screen.  The opening sequence with the ship flying in overhead as incredible.  I first saw the new release in Chicago, before marriage.  I believe the introduction of Jabba in Star Wars Episode IV was premature, and detracted from the overall story and the later introduction in Return of the Jedi.  The addition of the extra animals in the space port to me is comical, and reducing the value of the movie as well.  The other changes, I don't care about, the blast rings with the explosions don't really add anything in my opinion.  So, it was nice getting the bonus disk.

The Bonus disk is NOT a 4:3 version of the original, but is widescreen.  I adapted it to full width using 1080p output from the Samsung, and Cinematic Zoom 16 on the LG.  It is grainy, and has definite noise at first, but over time, the electronics of the Samsung and LG, and my brain, do a reasonable job of compensating and the movie is reasonably enjoyable; much moreso than the VHS tapes.  I don't have the laser disks, nor a laser disk player,, nor other prior versions.  The set may be expensive, but now I have a realiable copy that can survive better than tape, with care.

The main disk contains essentially the same limited edition as the tapes but in widescreen, and significantly better resolution, and cleaned up, with better sound.  The Limited edition is essentially the same story as the original, with some changes that can be annoying if you let them, but the main stuff is still there, and on this disk much better than tape.

So, even though a bit expensive, it is worth replacing the tape with this set.  And, I expect that in 2017. a 40th year anniversary edition will be released,, and it may contain a properly formatted and cleaned up set of Original Theatrical Releases (2 per episode) and an even later updated version (Directors cut/play).  But, I don't want to wait, and don't want to gamble.

My recommendation = your choice.  I gave it 4 stars because ""I like it"" it isn't perfect, but it is not horrible, given my equipment.",1447027200,5,2412,4.521939953810624

It's unconscionable that one of the greatest series of films ever made is being kept from possibly the most enthusiastic fanbase of any movie ever made. How hard is it to give the fans what they want? I can't think of another movie where the fans are in such stark disagreement with the director and the studios as to what is the best version of the movie is. Did Disney not buy the rights to the original versions? Did George Lucas destroy them so they would never have the chance to be rereleased and prove what a mistake he made in adding in cheap looking cgi? I have no idea but if there ever was a time to release a remastered version of the originals this was the time, Disney could have cleaned up with the huge resurgence the franchise is headed for with the new movies. George Lucas should have left well enough alone, I mean the original trilogy had a few of the most successful movies of all time without any changes or updates.

Disney has a long established history of releasing many of their theatrical films to home video only in an altered form.  Despite some bad dialog, the original Star Wars was an immersive experience because of a seamlessly consistent visual style, even more so than the other two films in the original trilogy.

377195,2,6301773551,"I'm somewhat puzzled concerning this re-release.

First, I don't know any Star Wars fan who would just buy a single film out of the three. This could or should have been released as a box set with a corresponding nice price.

Second, in order to get the Original Trilogy bonus disc (including previously unseen deleted footage) one had to buy the Complete Saga Blu-ray box including the prequels. Personally I don't care about the prequels (and even CLONE WARS hasn't changed that). Thus, this would have been an opportunity to at least provide OT fans with a box AND this particular bonus disc.

Third, all previous releases on DVD and Blu-ray had serious issues in terms of color accuracy, correct brightness and correct contrast levels. Some time ago I gave my old Japanese LaserDisc a spin and the original NEW HOPE colors it revealed gave the film an almost ""3D"" impression despite its despicable LBX standard definition resolution. Apparently, it's unlikely these aforementioned issues have been fixed?

Fourth, I understand that there are fans that grew up with the Special Edition, it's the one they saw for the first time on the big screen and it's understandable that it's ""their"" favorite version of the film. But as an ""old fossil"" I really want to re-experience the film in my home theater the way I saw it first and for many years following, i.e. the original theatrical version. Up to this day I and many others did not get the chance to experience the Rebel fighters' approach to the Death Star with the original VFX miniature footage in HD and many, many other scenes that have practically been erased / overwritten by the Special Edition. It's a simple matter of CHOICE I'm asking for.",1439424000,59,1703,4.802047781569966

It is an absolute shame that Star Wars films continue to receive such low rankings from so many. I like many people did not care for Lucas' minor changes/additions to the original trilogy. However, it was not that big of a change. I say ""let it go"" and if you already own the movies then do not purchase them for a second time. All movies these days are continously repackaged. This is not something excluse to the Star Wars franchise.

These are wonderful movies! To those of you who are new to this franchise take the chance and buy these films. I promise that you will not regret it!

We asked for an unaltered, original version, and that's what we got, an unaltered original version complete with all the things that others have commented on.

When my dad took my brother (age 9) out to see it, I was angry. Never a fan of sci-fi, I dreaded the next two hours. Then, a transformation. A major crush on Harrison Ford, pride that it was a Lucasfilm, and completely overwhelmed. My brother had the same response. We saved our allowances and begged to be taken every weekend as long as it was in town. I bought the soundtrack, and learned more about the recording studio from its liner notes than I ever had - my ambition at that age was to be an audio engineer. The story, the outstanding acting, the MUSUC - it all came together in one film for me. Sequels and prequels did not capture my fancy. Even though I was 18 or 19, Jabba the Hut frightened me badly. I cried a lot, to the humiliation of my boyfriend. Such pure evil combined with such power had me sobbing for my mommy.

377352,5,6301773551,"This  one  I'm  going  to  say  is  second  best  out  of  all  3  Starwars  movies.
Princess  Lea  has  got  the  readouts  of  the  Death star  &  is  on  her  way  to  Alderrann  to  give  them  to  her  father  &  save  her  people,  But  she's  captured  &  is  held  hostage  until  they  get  the  plans  back.
She  does  put  a  data  disc  into  R2D2  in  hopes  that  he'll  take  Obi wan Kenobi  a  message,  which  he  does.  R2D2  &  C3po  land  on  a  desolate  dry  desert  like  planet.
R2D2  appears  to  know  more  then  C3PO  about  what  to  do.
They're  soon  collected  by  Jawas,  that's  what  they're  called,  that's  what  it  said  in  a  book.  &  get  sold  to  uncle  Owen.  Luke  Skywalker's  uncle.  Would  Owen  be  Annikan's  brother,  Annikan  is  now  known  as  Darth Vader.  Luke  helps  his  uncle  manage  an  agricultural  farm.  As  we  know  Luke's  determined  to  go  off  on  his  own  with  the  rest  of  his  friends.  His  uncle  is  reluctant  to  let  him  go  because  he  needs  him  on  the  farm.
Luke  leaves  one  morning  searching  for  R2D2  who's  ran  off.
I  liked  the  SandPeople  the  best,  they  had  something  over  their  eyes  which  looked  like  night viewing  goggles  &  had  on  robes.  If  the  weather  is  hot  in  that  part  of  the  world  you'd  probably  end  up  suffocating  in  real  life.  Soon  Obi Wan  appears  rescuing  Luke.
He  was  a  nice  man.  Luke  though  must  return  to  uncle Owen  to  get  back  with  his  chore's  &  stuff. But  the  imperial  Storm  troopers  sent  down  to  find  the  droids  have  destroyed  Luke's  home  &  killed  both  his  aunt  &  uncle.  Now  all  that's  left  is  their  skeletons.  Luke  was  frightened  &  he  returns  to  Obi Wan  to  go  with  him.
They  soon  meet  Han Solo  (Harrison Ford)  who's  nothing  but  a  Jerk!  Because  him  &  Luke  didn't  get  along  too  well  when  they  first  met.  Luke  did  have  trouble  of  his  own  with  somebody  else.
So  agreeing  to  the  deal  they  go  with  Han Solo  &  Chewie.
&  Lea  witnesses  her  home  planet  when  its  destroyed  by  the  death star.  Obi Wan  senses  what  happened.
&  then  they're  caught  by  the  tractor  beam  &  end  up  at  the  death star.  Luke  &  Han  learn  of  Princess  Lea  &  that  she  does  exist,  &  must  rescue  her,  while  Obi Wan,  attempts  to  tamper  with  the  controls  &  disable  the  tractor  beam.
He  unexpectedly  though  finds  Darth Vader.
They  battle,  while  Luke, Lea & Han  defend  themselves  from  stormtrooper's.  &  get  out  of  odd  &  strange  situations.
Obi Wan does  get  distracted  right  before  they  left  Looking  across  at  Luke  &  his  friends. &  is  struck  down  by  Vader. He  had  given  Vader  some  sort  of  symbol. Luke  was  torn  up  after  he  saw  what  happened  to  Ben Kenobi.  I  wouldn't  know  whether  or  not  Vader  got  a  good  look  at  Luke  right  there.
Luke Han & Lea  soon  arrive  at  the  rebel  base,  &  must  prepare  a  defense  attack  on  the  Death star.  To  avoid  ending  up  like  Lea's  home  planet  Alderrann.  So  a  small  group  of  fighters  is  launched  for  an  attack.  They  shoot  up  the  surface  guns,  &  minor  damage, lightly  skimming  the  death star.  The  majority  of  fighter's  gets  killed  leaving  only  3  of  them  to  destroy  the  Death Star.  Luke  Blow's  it  up  at  last,  Afterwards  Darth Vader  goes  off  to  the  unknown  in  space.
Han  returns  &  him  &  Luke  are  given  medals.  It  does  have  a  good  ending.",1434499200,,3593,4.2095400340715505

Obi-Wan Kenobi emerges to steer a young Luke Skywalker to his destiny, as Jedi training master - Yoda, agrees to train another pupil. Although the bulk of the Jedi Knights have been extinguished..., a glimmer of hope resides with a brave, faction of citizens from the galaxy that survived the Emperor's extermination. They are known as the 'Rebels'. Darth Vader and the wicked Emperor 'sense' that 'The Force' is not only, once again - stirring, but increasing in strength and purpose, as well. But where exactly is it coming from and where, is this 'rebel base' that would dare..., to try and over throw the vile Emperor and his tyrannical kingdom? And why, is the twisted and tormented evil within Darth Vader, so unsettling to him, professionally and even, personally? How can 'the Force' which was once, powerful within and through him, resurrect itself and even emanate within and through another, in greater power than it did in and through him? Princess Leia and the 'Rebel' fighters are joined and assisted by Luke Skywalker, Hans Solo, Chewbacca and two lovable droids, R2-D2 and C-3P0. But, in so doing, can the 'Rebel' fighters locate and destroy the Emperor's biggest weapon against them? The Death Star? Before he uses it to annihilate them, all? Watch and see how it all, unfolds. On this 2 disc, DVD set. A thrilling, intergalactic, space odyssey of STAR WARS/A NEW HOPE, that rivets it's audience by daring to defy evil, at it's core. Do the courageous 'Rebels' achieve the seemingly impossible? Pop the popcorn and watch and see, for yourself. Because righteous and justifiable payback's in the face of willful, malicious, cosmic warfare, are oh! so sweet to behold! This STAR WARS film of spectacular 'Rebel' revenge is awesome!!

377453,5,6301773551,"Unlike most in my generation, I did not grow up watching Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.  (Of course, back in the day it was just called Star Wars.)  But I was well aware of the original trilogy even if I didn't see this movie until high school or the complete original trilogy until college.  I'm not sure how much that awareness contributes to my enjoyment of this movie, but I do still enjoy it.

Since this movie was done first, you can always jump in here.  (In fact, it's fun to see the errors that develop because of the prequels like characters who don't seem to know planets they've been on before.)

The galaxy is under the oppressive rule of an empire.  But there are a group of rebels trying to overthrow this empire.  Among the rebels is Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).  She's stolen some plans to the empire's new ultimate weapon, but before she can get those plans back to the other rebels, she is captured by Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones).  But she sends the plans to the nearby planet with the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO.

The droid falls into the hands of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).  But R2-D2 is determined to deliver his message to Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness).  That thrusts Luke into a wild new adventure as the pair try to smuggle the droids back off the planet with the help of smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford).  Will they make it?  Can the rebellion use the information in the droids?

 There is a reason this movie is so popular.  It is just plain fun action from start to finish.  You start with a fire fight in space, and things keep moving from there.  Yes, the time on the planet as we are introduced to Luke and Obi-Wan is a bit on the slow side, but it is needed to introduce the characters and really get the story moving.  Once we have characters we can care about, we care about the outcome of the space battles and tight situations so much more.

And that's another thing that really helps this movie - you can't help but love the characters.  Luke is so earnest and wants to help.  Leia is very confident and even defiant.  And Han appears to be only out for himself and his profit even if he cares more than he's willing to admit.

Praise really has to go to the actors for this.  The characters are types more than true characters, but you'd never know it from the performances.  We believe every moment on screen because the actors are pouring their heart and soul into it.

After noticing how cheesy the writing was in the first few movies, I was prepared for some cheesy writing here.  Some of the lines were a bit on the cheesy side, but again the performances elevated it.  The actors would deliver those lines with the right amount of sarcasm and wit to turn what could have been cringe worthy into some of the funniest lines of the movie.  And you can't picture any other line fitting that scene.

This movie was first released in 1977, so the special effects are not up to today's high tech, CGI standards.  And that means occasionally things don't look quite real.  However, most of it does look very real.  If you are willing to get lost in the movie, you'll find that you aren't noticing special effects but believe what you see and the story absorbs you.

Of course, the movie does scream 70's in other ways, like hair styles on the guys and at times moments of acting.  To me, that is just part of the fun.

And fun is the key word when discussing Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.  Fun is the reason why so many people love it so much.  I can't help but smile as I watch it.",1430697600,,3541,4.336890243902439

377480,3,6301773551,"I recently watched this movie in its original, truly unaltered form (I think it was 2004 when they last released it that way, maybe even 1997) and it's SUCH a good movie. The raw, unpolished nature is a huge part of its charm. The lightsabers look, in my opinion, cooler because they haven't been digitized. It makes them look more like a dangerous energy weapon and less like an anime cartoon toy.

But more than just the visual, I think a lot of the editing choices that were made take the movie away from itself. Not just the ""Han Shot First"" issue, but other smaller things like adding more activity to the Moss Eisley Space Port. Not to get too nerdy, but Luke's homeworld was supposed to be at the back end of nowhere, and you wouldn't expect there to be a huge thriving spaceport there. By adding more stuff to locations like that, they've taken away from the charm of there being a stripped-down, used-up feel to the Star Wars universe.

The only area that I really feel the digital touching up was worthwhile was in the space battles. Adding more ships and better explosions seems pretty reasonable. But using modern editing techniques to alter the story, or add new things simply because they can be added is a huge mistake, and when you see it in its original form you realize how much was lost.

Which is why they haven't released it in that form since then. Its an implicit acknowledgement that the edited version can't stand up to a side-by-side comparison.",1430611200,3,1471,4.5643939393939394

Okay, so is the Theatrical version of the movie included in this new package?  I bought one of the DVD versions and dumped my VHS version only to find the movie so disturbingly changed and I have not watched Star Wars now for about 20 years.  None of the children in our family have seen the original movies because none of us adults want to sit through the changed movies which we all hate so much.  Blade Runner, E.T., the directors of those movies all realized that hundreds of millions of their movie fans may not share their one vision of the movies they created and so offered all of the various cuts of their movies including the theatrical version.  It is pretty arrogant for a single man to force his view on millions of other people after something is fixed in their minds.  It'd be like Di Vinci coming back and changing the Mona Lisa's smile into a frown.  All most people want is the option to see the original movie they remember from their memories.

Okay, next question.  Do you get a DVD/Blu Ray copy of this movie or is it only a stream?  If not a hard copy, then I won't be able to sit back on my chair in the living room and watch it on my 50 inch TV.  Instead the family will have to huddle around my desk in the office and watch it on my computer or gather around my Smart Phone.

Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope is the film that started it all! I'm not just talking about the Star Wars saga, I'm talking about blockbuster movies in general!
The film blew audiences away in 1977 with it's literally revolutionary special effects. But the effects are far from the only thing that put ""Star Wars"" on the map. The reason the film is so beloved is also due to it's unforgettable cast of characters, John William's legendary musical score and the pure imagination that George Lucas put into the film.
Lucas knows that it takes more than just visual effects to make a movie great. Well, I mean, back then he did. You see, a funny thing happened in 1999...
Anyway, the effects in Star Wars changed the movie industry forever and the imagination put into the characters and the universe of the film continues to inspire people nearly four decades later.",1427241600,,982,4.5852272727272725

377599,1,6301773551,"Yeah-yeah, buyer beware and I should have read further.  This thing ($32.00) showed up in a Jiffy mailer with a smashed corner and actually looked like someone had tried to open it before it ever left the warehouse.  I had thought I ordered the Trilogy and reluctantly thought $32.00 was a bit lofty but I really wanted them.  Yes, it's out there for $30, too.

If I didn't order $8-$10 CD's all day that shipped Prime IN A BOX, I'd understand.  On that note, I can buy a wide variety of ground breaking, world changing, classic music for $8-$10.  I own some Hendrix that only real Hendrix fans know of.  I can buy a lot of similar movies for the same price.  $30 for 1 Star Wars movie?  Really?  And for that price, you can't even mail the thing in a box?  Shame on you and shame on whoever allows you to charge consumers $30 for a 40 year old movie that's, well, just another DVD.  I'd presume there are people out there that collect these and they'd be pissed they got his thing for $10, let alone in a smashed case.

FYI, Somewhere along the line they decided to label the original Star Wars as ""Star Wars IV""  I'm a little pissed I had to waste 30-45 minutes of my life to sort through that hot mess.  Anyway, you can keep this really expensive 40 year old movie in it's really expensive plastic case.  At some point, even the true cult followers will tell you to keep your $ .30 disc and the $.50 box it shipped in for $30.00.  I normally claim that I don't rate things on the way they showed up at the door but for this price, you should have put this thing in a powder coated steel case and still made $25 on the order.

Soooo I'll just touch upon the Limited edition part people care about for this. The original unaltered version of the movie, I've seen people complain it's just a copy and paste of some laserdisc version and some other things and honestly they just need to stop whining. When I put it on my dvd players it just looks like a normal wide screen movies these days, so complaining about some black bars on top and bottom of screen is really stupid to complain about. The only time I had an issue with the screen size was when I had the movie on my moms laptop when I was out of state and the screen was super tiny as heck, like it was trying to play it the size of a lunchbox or smaller.

I was expecting that they didn't remaster it because Lucas probably didn't even want to release the film as it was seen in theaters, but they didn't even transfer the film to DVD, they just recorded the VHS to DVD.  So here I am looking at  2:35:1 movie in 4:3 format instead of 16:9 (They could have at least done that).  This means this version isn't even recorded in 480p quality, and the lesser quality is being upscaled to 1080p on my PS4.  It looks awful.  I'm glad I just bought one of these and not the whole trilogy, especially since the last two are so overpriced since they are OOP.  I'm going to try laserdisc next until Disney decides to remaster the Theatrical version and release it on blu-ray.  2015 around the time of relaase of the new movie will be my guess.",1420070400,5,886,4.327272727272727

This movie spawned the creation of the special effects company Industrial Light and Magic. Founded by George Lucas himself IL&M has done the special effects work on many major movies since. The story is good although predictable at times. The character development of Luke is fantastic. And of course John Williams classic Star Wars theme speaks for itself.

377708,5,6301773551,"When I was 7, my cousin Mickey and I saw this film at the drive-in theater in Euclid, Ohio. Every year thereafter my dad would take me to see this classic when it was released again until its final release just before the film was released in 1982 on VHS and Betamax home video (as a rental only) and later released for home ownership. But the reason I bought this DVD was not for the first disc. I bought this for the bonus DVD with the original 1977 theatrical version of the movie...the one before the title, EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE was added to the crawl.

If you are a staunch supporter of the ""Han shoots first!"" argument and detractor of the additional things that Lucas added unnecessarily (with exception the the cool solar flare around Alderaan and the Death Star when they explode), then this is the DVD for you. It cannot be found anywhere now in the retail market in NEW condition. Only in used CD and video stores will you find this gem. And, while I feel that the prices on Amazon for this version can be pricey at times, I know collectors will pay top dollar for the theatrical versions of the original trilogy films.

The 1977 theatrical version is presented in a widescreen format, preserving the original aspect ratio of its big screen showings, however, it is not formatted for the 16 X 9 coding used to format letterbox for widescreen TV sets of the present. So no matter how hard you may try, you will never be able to watch this version without the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen unless you click the zoom feature on your remote control. But doing that will crop most of the film, making it grainy and blurry in spots. This version is strictly for purists who are looking for 100% nostalgia.

The transfer was not given any special treatments either. There remain blemishes in the print that resemble that of the version that was issued on VHS in 1982, however, it gives the film a fun, theatrical viewing style which for me, is great if you want to relive this one from your childhood in its original form. There were no enhancements in color, picture or sound, or anything. This plays back in a monaural soundtrack. So if you want stereo, you will get simulated, not true stereo sound in this version and will have to hold out for Disney to release, if ever, a stereo version of this film.

But if you want a fun and true cinematic experience in your own living room, and want to share with your kids the version you originally saw in theaters, this version (on disc 2) is the one you want. What are you waiting for? Pick up a copy before you can't get it anymore. You'll be glad you did.

In closing, the only thing I didn't like about this DVD set is the artwork on the cover (front and back), It would have been nice if Lucasfilm and FOX went with the original film poster for the front of this amaray case. You will see the same artwork on disc 1 in this set.

Return to that galaxy far, far away...and watch a great adventure take place in your own living rooms again and again.

Now for the second part of my review, for the fans who feel they were short-changed by this release:

I think it is so amazing how people always seem to think they are OWED or ENTITLED to something. How arrogant and self-absorbed can people really be? Well, apparently 90% of the fans of STAR WARS seem to be in regards to this movie series. First of all, I am embarrassed to be a STAR WARS fan now and to be lumped in with the company of people who take it as a personal affront by George Lucas to update his films for a new generation of film lovers. Do I like the Special Edition versions? Not at all. But I feel the opposite of the rest of you who seem to hate them to the point of calling for a boycott of George Lucas and spewing your bile at him for updating his films. They are HIS! They are not yours. He can do what he wants with them.

You really have no idea how petty and trivial you all sound. Let me tell you. You do and you are! George Lucas never once forced anyone to go to the theater to see STAR WARS or any other film in this series. He didn't hold a gun to your head (or a lightsaber to your throats) threatening your life if you didn't invest your hard-earned money in his products. You did that all on your own...freely and of your own choice. And, while I wish Lucasfilm had released the original versions in anamorphic widescreen editions, I am just satisfied to have them and to be able to share them with a younger audience. If you don't like them, fine. That is your right, too. But stop crying like the spoiled brats your parents raised you to be and move on with your one and only lives.

While I believe that George Lucas owes you NOTHING, I feel you owe George Lucas an apology for your selfishness, your rudeness, and your vitriolic words of hatred toward him. He does not answer to his fans and to demand from the man that which you feel you are entitled to, just drives home the point that this generation for the most part is a selfish, arrogant bunch whose belief in self-entitlement is downright sickening. So you didn't get the versions of STAR WARS that you wanted? Big deal! That's life! Deal with it! I believe there are more important issues in this life than STAR WARS and the version that has been released here in this amaray case. But others here will cry and whine and spew until the end of your lives. But, that is your choice. And what a waste is is.

As for the Special Editions, fans who enjoy the newer effects can have them now to enjoy. I recently bought a Blu-ray player, but have not spent the money for the complete saga on Blu-ray. Why not, you ask? I am holding out hope that Disney will release the original version to us on Blu-ray. But if they don't, I am not going to go insane on them and boycott them. That is stupid and shows a maturity level of dirt. I am not making any demands on anyone because I would not presume to act as though I am entitled to own the original film I grew up on.

For those demanding better from George Lucas, I say to you look at yourselves first. I'm sure your parents raised you to be better than that which you seem to be projecting here. If not, then your parents failed you and your unwillingness to accept that has been redirected at George Lucas in your misguided attempts to feel better about yourselves. Grow up and get on with your one and only lives. Stop making the rest of the fans of STAR WARS look bad. Go make your own science fiction classic and then come back and see how well you and your own product are received by your ""adoring"" public.

If I were George Lucas, I would ignore you, too. Why would I want to give a whiny, spoiled brat more when they blatantly show me disrespect? Think of that as you look back on your own pathetic and useless lives.",1397520000,,6790,4.274708171206226

First impression, of course, is how young Harrison Ford looks(the other stars I have not seen since they made this film), Of course, Alec Guinness is gone now as are others I didn't identify ( I imagine). Unlike more avid film-goers, I know only the versions that are presented in the six that I purchased, so have nothing to add to that favored discussion of some reviewers. What did I think about the film that is shown here. It was good fun. Little time was spent on anything that didn't directly contribute to the action, which was usually good to watch. There is no thought involved, no issues of any consequence (I can't get worked up about the Fate of the Empire or Plant Xenia.) The acting was appropriate to the demands of the film, which were light indeed. Alec Guinness, of course, needed only a small fraction of his talent, to look good and to fulfill his contract. Ford and Hamill were appealing in their parts, which required minimal acting skills, Fisher was barely adequate in a part that was barely part of the film. No fault of hers, so far as I can see, that was the way it was written.
All-in-all, for those who have not seen the movie previously, this is very light but entertaining fare. My star rating, of course, only evaluates this against other similar films.",1383091200,,1466,4.49438202247191

377779,5,6301773551,"This review concerns the movie itself, not nit-picking a dvd or Blu-ray version. Star Wars Episode IV was released in May 1977; I was not quite 5 years old yet. One of my earliest memories is going to the theater with my parents and older sister and watching the original release. I do clearly remember that Darth Vader scared the heck out of me then. So, I was not a happy camper when I was carried out of the theater at the end of the movie, but that changed in the next year. I couldn't get enough Star Wars action figures, records, and most importantly, books. My dad didn't get me the kiddie Star Wars storybooks, he got me the Del Rey novel with no pictures, and basically told me to figure it out. I'll bet he regretted that, because I kept asking him what all those big words meant, but I did figure it out, and I think that book boosted my vocabulary at an early age.

So to me, this is a lot more than just 'a movie;' it's my childhood. I stayed hooked on Star Wars all the way through Return of the Jedi and after, until Star Wars seemed to fade away in the mid to late 80s. Every scene in this movie, every line of dialogue reminds me of something from my childhood, so I have no choice but to give it 5 stars.

Yes they are a coversion from laser disk, are they the hi-quality remasted digital picture that we are accustomed too today, no. They are still better than the old VHS version, and to me that is part of the Beauity of it. You get to see Star Wars for what it was. You get to seen a nice clean film with good sound, with an emphisis on plot and story as well as on speical effects. Let Lucas keep his remaster, re-touching, and redubbing, and give me this, its what the Star Wars of my memoires are.

To me that is part of the problem with the new thee installments, they look awsome, the plot was good, the writing was squishy. Too much reliance on state of the art sound and visual FX not enough time/money on dialogue.

So let lucas keep his ""remastering"" I'll take my laser disk recopy and my vintage feel. I've never met a kid didn't go ""WOH"" when they see Episode IV, V, & VI the first time.

377785,4,6301773551,"I bought this a while ago when they were still in stores because I knew Lucas would never stop changing his movies and I was right. There are good things and bad things about this release.

The GOOD
-The good thing is obviously seeing the Theatrical unchanged versions of SW which are becoming harder and harder to find these days.
-Preservation of the original content on a newer medium.

The BAD
-Lucas seems intent on making his new version the ONLY version (however he keeps changing his only version so we now have 3 separate movies with changes in them through the years) therefore the only way to get this release passed they had to package it with the 04 releases and say that the original movies are just a Bonus. -They should be cheaper especially since the 2nd disc is all we care about.

The So So
-Quality of the Originals were not up to date. On one hand they look pathetic compared to the 04 remastered version but on the other hand I felt they looked better than VHS and were perfectly passable. I would have liked the original movies remastered but then again last time Lucas tried to do this we ended up with the Special Editions. I'll take the lower quality over them not existing at all on DVD and risking them being messed with again.

377801,4,6301773551,"I can not, with good conscience, rate this with a 5-star rating.

I know I would probably be preaching to the choir about how much the original Star Wars trilogy affected my life growing up. I, like many kids who grew up in the early 1980's, was a Star Wars fanatic! I lived it and breathed it. My brother and I had a fantastic collection of Star Wars figures and vehicles, not to mention bed sheets, mugs, erasers, folders, storybooks, etc. It was these films that would begin to shape my tastes in cinema and begin to lay the blueprints of the kind of person I would grow up to be.

Episode IV: A New Hope, was released just a week or so after I was born, so you could say that the Star Wars franchise and I have a unique bond. We are exactly as old as each other, and it has been with me my entire life and is something I deeply cherish, not only for it's cinematic mastery, but because of the impact it has had on pop culture and the lexicon of a generation.

That being said, I find what Mr. George Lucas did to the original trilogy, for the most part, to be utterly appalling. Although I did think they did a great job redesigning the X-Wing assault on the Death Star at the end of Episode IV, I think just about everything else is a joke! You get the feeling at times that Lucas' original vision for Star Wars, based on how he has butchered the films in the Special Editions, was some hokey B-movie with cheesy characters and crappy looking monsters. It completely flies in the face of what he was able to do originally and takes away alot of the innocence of the original trilogy. I won't even go into how bad the prequel trilogy was and how much it has soured me on the Star Wars franchise in general.

I'll end by saying, I loved the original trilogy in its unaltered state. If Lucasfilm (now owned by Disney) wanted to make the fans happy, then they'd release the ultimate trilogy Blu-Ray set - a Blu Ray set that includes not only the Special Edition of each film, but the Original, unaltered versions as well, and as an added bonus, a feature that allows fans to ""cut in"" only the sections of the Special Editions that they like into the original films, (i.e being able to leave ANH completely unaltered aside from the redone final assault sequence for instance) thus making the perfect marriage of the two editions.",1366848000,,2329,4.334862385321101

377804,5,6301773551,"with the best structure I've ever seen, only film that comes close is Night of the Living Dead but not really even that film is as well told.  Other fans like it for the neat villain, light saber, robots, twin suns, jawas, the force, multiple cantina monsters, etc., but I like it because of it's outstanding story structure.  When I feel well enough to go into better detail, I will, but this story to me, is nearly flawlessly told.  Only errors storywise I ever saw were (1) when Vader choked the rebel in the opening scenes, and the man's feet remained parallel to the ground, in real life someone being choked and lifted off their feet would have struggled to keep their toes in contact with the ground for as long as possible, therefore he wouldn't have had his feet be flat in that situation. Looked cool visually, but not how a person being strangled would've behaved; (2) In act 2 in the trash compactor sequence, had Han Solo really thought he was about to die, doubtful he would've been making jokes ""one things for sure, we're all going to be alot thinner."" Most people facing death would not say that;  (3) Act 3 when Luke is trying to convince Han to join the rebels, he chides Han and tells him to take care of himself as that's what he's best at. Han had just helped the rebellion and risked his life by helping to rescue the princess and gotten the space station plans to the rebels. He'd not signed up to be a rebel but only to deliver Luke/Obi/droids to alderoon. After he'd been captured, he agreed to help rescue the princess, for a fee, and he'd fulfilled his side of the bargain against almost overwhelming odds. For Luke to be miffed at him was abit much, especially when considering that at the beginning of this film, which covers maybe 2 or 3 days, Luke himself had turned down Obi Wan's initial request to come to Alderoon and learn the ways of the force. Also, Han barely knew Luke so I thought it presumptuous of Luke to judge Han as looking after himself, considering what Han had already helped accomplish. Mr. Lucas really helps cover this by Han's comments in the Falcon when he has Han tell Leia that he's only in it for the money (Lucas is brilliant, he truly is), so he tries to write over it, and of course, he's made the audience dislike Han, but Luke's comment is a tiny bit hypocritical given his own actions just a day or so earlier. Still George Lucas needed to have Luke ask Han, I wish Luke hadn't forgotten his own comments to Obi Wan like a day or so ago. Overall, though, these are very tiny mistakes/quibbles, and considering the character inconsistencies and logic flaws in so many other films, A New Hope is a magnificent achievement. Thank  you George Lucas, and the entire team of people involved with creation of my favorite film.  It's given me years of pleasure.",1360540800,,2817,4.481481481481482

This introduced the world to Luke, Han, Vader, Obi-Wan, Leia, Jedi,  Light Sabers, The Falcon, R2D2, and C-3PO.  Fans never tire of seeing all of them.

Death Star is the biggest part of this movie - figuratively and literally. It's the reason Leia came to Tattooine.  Why R2 needed to find Obi-Wan. Why Leia was held and tortured.  The duel between Obi-Wan and Vader was aboard the Death Star.  Han, Luke, and Leia bond while escaping the Death. Vader defends it and Luke defeats it.

The Death Star's primary weapon had the power to destroy entire planets - to literally/physically end a world.  The turbo weapons on the outside would have been able to hold off a fleet even without the main weapon.  Also thousands of Tie Fighters were on board.

The whole thing was the size of a moon.  But it wasn't at all like a moon.  It was all metal, smooth, sterile, and inorganic. It was completely lifeless - except for it's population. Over 1 million sentient being were aboard.  Troopers, Officers, Civilian Workers, and Slaves - Including Wookiee Slaves.

It was designed to be invulnerable to attack.  To be able to destroy and defeat anything. It was meant to be so vast and powerful that the sight of it would overpower most people.  It was meant to be completely under Tarkin's control, and the means by which Tarkin, Vader, and the Emperor would rule the entire galaxy by Fear.

The Death Star the the physical embodiment of how the Empire saw itself, and of the Empire's Dominance.  When it was destroyed, that was more than a victory.  It blasted a place into galactic memory.  It marked a major turning point away from the Empire and the Dark Side.

Also: Vader had said ""The Ability to destroy a Planet is insignificant next to the Power of the Force.""  Luke proved him right by destroying the Death Star.",1357344000,,1910,4.632835820895522

377825,5,6301773551,"In 1977, George Lucas released a film that pushed special effects farther than ever before, and made an instant classic. One thing that should be noted is that this film brought the sci fi genre back to life, and it's success gave films like the original ""Alien"" the greenlight.

The plot of this film isn't hard to get into: It is a period of civil war, and the evil empire (lead by the diabolical Darth Vader) is getting stronger and stronger. However, the rebellion won't go down without a fight. After winning their first victory, Princess Leia and a band of rebels have stolen secret plans to the empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored Space Station with enough power to destroy an entire planet! Now, Leia must team up with a band of rebels; the farm boy Luke Skywalker, the theif Han Solo, and wise hermet Obi-Wan Kenobi, to stop the empire before they gain complete control over the galaxy.

THE POSITIVES:
-The story is very creative, and the script is really tight.

-The characters are all great, developed well, and the acting is great. The stand out role here has to go to Harrison Ford as the witty Han Solo, he brings and extra degree of fun to the film (and yes, he DID shoot first).

-Overall, the pacing is pretty good, and there is plenty of action to satisfy.

-The directing is great as well, George Lucas deserves every bit of credit for his work on this film.

-Words can't describe the amount of spectacle Lucas gives us with the effects here. The scenes in space specifically gives us a more open environment in space like never before, and the ""dog fights"" with the fighters are extremely well done Audio, video, everything is amazing.

THE NEGATIVES:
-The pacing is really good MOST of the time. The section on Lukes home planet, Tatooine, is easily the slowest point of the film. Some of these scenes either could have been edited more, or could have have a tad more action. BUT, the opening sequence of the film is great, and the audience can greatly appreciate the build up with the characters.

-The acting is good most of the time, but there are still a few lines of dialogue that are delivered ackward, or are just written poorly. But, this is merely a nitpick (especially considering much of the cast here are newcomers) so it's easy to forgive that.

THE CHANGES:
-This being a Star Wars review, I am pretty much required by law to list the good and bad (mostly bad) ""Lucas changes"" to a film trilogy that was already perfectly fine. I don't want to bore anyone with a list of every single Star Wars change that is in this film, but I will address my least favorite change of this film:

-Han shot first, period. In the original cut, when Han is held at gun point by a bounty hunter, Greedo, he kills him without mercy. BUT, George Lucas tamered with this scene, and now, Han and Greedo both shoot at the same time, making it as if Han shot in self defence. The change simply looks terrible on screen, and it's very obvious it's been messed with. What made Han Solo a relatable character is that he starts out as a guy who only cares about himself. But, as the film goes on, we see him become a better man. George Lucas' ""logic"" with this change is that Han could never kill in such a merciless way. But, isn't the whole THEME of the Star Wars series redemption? And according to Lucas's logic, I guess you can wipe out a bunch of innocent kids and be redemed, but killing a bounty hunter in cold blood is just too much...

-Yeah, there are a few CGI dubed parts that are stupid, but I can easily ignore those. And honestly, there are some scenes that extra footage does help clean up some scenes, and makes some of the flying sequences ""flow"" better, and some changes help make the Star Wars saga feel like one series. For example, when this film was released, it was simply titled ""Star Wars"" and he later had it retirled ""Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope"", which I think is a pretty fitting title. But, that's pretty much all the good I can say.

In the end, Star Wars was an instant classic, filled with genius film making. There are very few times I would call a film ""revolutionary"", but this is definately a film I would say changed the way we view and make movies, and many of the sci fi classics of the 80s might not have been made if it wasn't for Star Wars. If you are a sci fi/adventure film fan, this is a film you should check out. Sure, sci fi films are a dime a dozen now, but the reason why we have films like Avatar are BECAUSE of the original Star Wars trilogy. And to any Star Wars fan, I think this is a set worth getting, simply because it has the original theatrical edition. Yeah, the quality is pretty bad, but not unbearable. Besides, DVD's last much longer than VHS, so as of now, this is the best way to own the original theatrical edition. Although this isn't my personal favorite of the Star Wars series, it still deserves all the credit it gets, which is why I am giving ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope"" 5 stars.",1355097600,,5007,4.383620689655173

377850,3,6301773551,"Over the past week and a half I have re-watched the two Star Wars trilogy's, and decided to review the films because I have taken issue with the blind defense of the original films and hate for the prequels. There's the childhood version and the adult version of Star Wars IV: A New Hope. I think many people blindly hold to the vision of the film they had as a child. As a child growing up in the 1980's I loved the film and films. I would usually watch them once a week playing with the action figures pretending to be the characters with my cousin and friends. I loved my Boba Fett action figure I had. As you can tell he was my favorite character in the first Star Wars series followed by Han Solo and Chewbacca. Sadly I lost those toys along with the my original Transformer toys like Megatron, Jazz, Grimlock, Star Scream and my others that were more likely were thrown out by my mother. Damn I wish I still had them they had good memories and I could sell them for a lot of money. Anyway back to A New Hope. As a child I loved the film never noticing the flaws or problems, and there are quite a few. I think people need to be realistic and wake up from the childhood haze of the old Star War Series

The plot everyone should know by now. It follows a young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill who lives with his aunt and uncle on a farm on the planet Tatooine. He lives a boring live wishing to leave the farm for adventure. Things change when his aunt and uncle buy C-3PO and R2-D2 from Jawa traders. R2-D2 shows Luke a message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) asking for help from Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). The adventure takes off from there as all of you surely know. The story was written by George Lucas and is generally good. There are a few problems like the main character in Luke Skywalker. As a kid I didn't really pay attention to how unlikeable and annoying the character was, but as an adult you can see it. Then there is the Death Star. I don't understand why the Empire was building it. Talk about a waste of money. They could have just used the money to build enough star ships to overwhelm the resistance. Then there is the flaw in the design. Really they left a little hole in the ship that could take down the entire death star. Finally Darth Vader, Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and the other commanders didn't bother putting more starships around The Death Star for defense.

Even with the flaws I had with the story the acting was really good. The great actors Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness did an excellent job, and so did the now legendary Harrison Ford (Han Solo). He imbued his great charisma and good acting into the best character of the original Star Wars saga. James Earl Jones was magnificent as Vader's voice. Carrie Fisher did a decent job, but like Luke, Leia wasn't a very likeable character. Then there is Mark Hamill who I think did his best as Luke in the first A New Hope. Trying to show his naivety and slowing to come terms with his fate. Still either the way he acted or the way Lucas wrote the character Luke Skywalker comes out as unlikeable and annoying. I also much mention Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) who brilliantly brought life the Wookiee.

What was and is astounding are the special effects. George Lucas did manage to put in amazing special effects for the time with a tiny budget, and more importantly what Lucas did with little help from Fox, which was to his advantage as he kept many of the rights including merchandizing ones. Lucas nearly perfectly blended genres and elements from movies and films like The Hidden Fortress, Flash Gordon, The Guns of Navarone to name a few. It is remarkable what George Lucas achieved with A New Hope. He wrote the story for the film and his drive to see it created and brought to live in theaters is a testament to him. I'm sure many filmmakers would have given up after being turned down by many movie studios and the limited budget and time he had to work on the film, but he persevered. In doing so he created a universe that through him has brought on a life of its own through the sequels, pop culture references, spinoffs in the form of books and television shows and he inspired would inspire filmmakers, actors, and movie goers for generations to come. I will talk more about Lucas later in my reviews for the other five films.

As a child I think I would have given Star Wars IV: A New Hope 5 stars. Does it live up to my childhood memories? No it doesn't. It has plot holes in the story and flaws with the characters. That being said A New Hope is a great starting point with for a fun adventure with a unique story, interesting characters and great action special effects. I know it's hard to ruin your childhood memories, but I think people need to stop blindly defending the original films over the prequels. I know it's hard to see the flaws in things you loved as a child. It was hard for me. As a kid I loved the old GI. JOE cartoon, but as an adult you see the many flaws in the story, characters and the lack of bloodshed and death in a cartoon about solders who are trying to kill each other. It's the same for a film like Independence Day as a young teenager I loved the film I think I would have given it 4.5 out of 5 stars, but as an adult I saw the flaws in the film and I now have only given it 3 stars.

The original Star Wars (A New Hope) literally changed my life. At that point in my life I was living on a dirt poor farm and my whole life consisted of that little farm.

I remember my parents telling me we were going to see it and I was not particularly excited though I did notice the boys in my family who were going were actually jumping for joy.

I can tell you the instant I saw the first scene I knew it was something beyond special. I sat there in the cinema for two hours just so strongly spellbound that I froze in my seat. When the film ended I sat there trying to grasp what had just happened. To say my universe blossomed after that night would be the biggest understatement of my life.

After the film my interest in the universe around me exploded so much sometimes I would get overwhelmed trying to get a grasp on it. I can say with no reservation, this film was directly responsible for me going to University and thus my success in life. I can also say after the birth of my children it was one of the most paramount events in my life.

Our little farm became so tiny that I would get frustrated and begged my mum to take me to the library so I could study astronomy, physics, geology, religion, history, film, and the list goes on and on. I felt that this amazing door opened and the world transformed into this plaything for me to explore and understand.

I ended up getting two Master degrees and for my first one my thesis was on Star Wars. I felt it was a way to honour something that without I probably would not have been interested in going to school at all.

I know I gush and gush but there is just something magical about this film (and its sequels) that just tickles this special place in my psyche. It was the first full length film that I watched with all three of my children. Needless to say our house became a vessel to hold all of their Star Wars toys. I remember watching the looks on their faces as they watched and could see that same spellbound child that existed in 1977 in Inverness. I still tear up thinking about these two great influences in my life coming together and becoming something bigger than itself.

I know most of you have seen the film many times but take some time to watch it again and for goodness sake may the force be with you!",1343088000,67,2432,4.251082251082251

Anyway most people bought this DVD for the 2nd disc which is the Theatrical version. Many people will ask why is Lucas after shunning the fans for so long now decided to release the theatrical versions? The reason was piracy. People were making money of the theatrical versions but coping them and posting them on-line and burning DVD copies to sell them. Most of copies that were being sold were the 1993 Definitive Editions. And the mastermind of all Star Wars decided it was time to release them on DVD. Lucas didn't want to do anything special for the Theatrical versions so he went to his personal collections of his Star Wars Home Media materials and chose to copy his own copy of the 1993 Star Wars Definitive Edition on LaserDisc.  Its nothing but a simple LaserDisc transfer. So Basically he did this to cash on the Piracy sellers while selling it for a higher price. The worst part of 2nd disc is the letterbox widescreen which takes out 2/3rd of your tv. It didn't affect my WideScreen TV but still i wouldve liked it to be bigger. Anyway Image quality is not bad compared to my own transfers to DVD. Image Quality i would rate 9 out of 10. Sound quality is 10 out of 10 even though its only 2.0 Digital Audio.

Don't you remember? At the theatres, you would sometimes see a dark line or film spots on the movie screen that came from seeing a REAL FILM. You are lucky to even have this copy...which, by the way, IS NOT EVEN THE VERSION THAT WAS SHOWN IN 1977! Yes, that's right...this is the 1978 re-release. How can you tell? There are several differences (mainly sound), some of which were restored and added back in. Here they are:

1. The scene where Aunt Beru speaks to Uncle Owen after Luke leaves the dinner table: her voice has been overdubbed. To my knowledge, her 1977 original voice has never been restored.

2. Death Star scene - ""Close the blast doors!"" line by a stormtrooper while chasing Han and Chewie in the corridor. This was in the original 1977 sound print, but not in the original theatrical version on this dvd. Restored for the special editions.

3. Death Star scene - Han and Luke are dressed as stormtroopers and taking Chewie to the detention area. In the corridor, the mouse droid appears and Chewie yells and scares the droid away. This scene was NOT in the 1977 print.

4. The battle of Yavin - as the X-wings approach the Death Star, they set their wings in attack position. The 1977 sound print included a ""siren"" sound as the X-wings open. It disappeared for the '78 re-release and later was restored in the special editions.

It has been so many debates about which variations of the movies are better. I will say I was very happy when the Jabba the Hut scene was restored along with one of the important scenes with Biggs Darklighter; however, some of the spots where there is obvious ""cleaning up"" of the film I dislike very much (such as the Greedo scene and the gunfight in the detention area on the Death Star). But it is still the greatest movie of all time to me.",1324512000,,1962,4.484593837535014

THX Optimizer
Menus styled after some of the original 1970's Star Wars movie posters

The movie itself (4/5):

I'll give a very quick plot synopsis, since most of you are probably at least somewhat familiar with the movie already!

Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a typical Tatooine moisture-farmboy: he does all of his farm chores assigned to him by his aunt and uncle, he hangs out with his friends and he enjoys racing in his landspeeder.  He also dreams of one day leaving Tatooine and joining the Imperial Academy (not yet realizing that graduating from the Academy would mean joining the army ranks of the evil Galactic Empire!).  Thanks to the arrival of a pair of droids, he is whisked off on a grand adventure to rescue the beautiful and feisty Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and destroy the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star.  His companions on his adventure are: the droids C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), smug and sarcastic space smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and the wise old hermit Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), a former Jedi in exile.  He and his friends must escape the clutches of the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse, with voice provided by James Earl Jones), dark lord of the Sith, and Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing), commanding officer of the Death Star.

Will Luke and his friends escape from Vader and Tarkin?
Will the Death Star be destroyed?
Will the small but valiant Rebel Alliance survive the tyranny of the Empire and live to fight another day?

If you don't know the answers to these questions, then where have you been these past 34 years???

The video quality - Disc 1 (4.5/5):

Overall, the digital restoration work done by Lowry Digital on this anamorphic widescreen release of the Special Edition version is pretty darn good.  No grain is visible.  There were no digital artifacts of any kind that I could see.  I also didn't notice any edge enhancement.  My only complaint is about the colors.  Overall, the colors are very well done and vibrant, with deep and solid blacks.  All good things!  The only bad thing?  Sometimes, the skintones are just a little too much on the pink side for my tastes.

The audio quality - Disc 1 (5/5*):

In one word: amazing!  Especially considering that this movie is 34 years old!  Lots of deep, rich bass in all the right moments.  Very well-placed sound effects coming at you from all the right directions.  And the best part, at least for me?  John Williams' brilliantly stirring music score sounds the best it has ever sounded!  Bravo to the good folks at THX for performing such an amazing audio restoration job on the movie!

*Note: Some, but not all, Star Wars Episode IV Limited Edition Disc 1 discs have an audio remixing error:  in certain scenes on these discs the music and/or sound effects are mixed so loudly that they overpower the dialogue, making the dialogue nearly impossible to hear.  If you happen to get one of these defective discs, please contact either Amazon or the Amazon Marketplace seller you bought it from to let them know of the problem.

The bonus features quality - Disc 1 (4/5):

The only major bonus feature on Disc 1 is the audio commentary featuring Lucas, Burtt, Muren and Fisher.  There are a few dull moments (Lucas himself is not the most interesting guy to listen to).  Overall though, it's a pretty interesting commentary, with Burtt and Muren both providing some interesting technical info and Fisher giving us some juicy anecdotes about what it was like working on-set with Lucas, Hamill, Ford, etc.

The video quality - Disc 2 (2/5):

Sadly, the video quality of the original 1977 theatrical version isn't nearly as good as that found on the Special Edition version on Disc 1.  It's VERY obvious that NO video restoration was done to the theatrical version.  What we get is a non-anamorphic widescreen version of an old silkscreen film print of the movie, complete with lots of grain, muted colors, some mosquito noise, and even a little bit of what I call film wavering here and there (in which the image moves rather noticeable from left to right and back again.  Repeatedly.).  It's probably not the worst the theatrical version has ever looked, but it's CERTAINLY NOT the best, either.

The audio quality - Disc 2 (2.5/5):

The audio quality of the theatrical version fares a little better.  What's presented here, audio-wise, is the original 1977 2-channel Dolby Stereo audio track.  Overall, it sounds pretty okay, considering no restoration work was done to it, either.  The sound effects are perfectly serviceable, and the music sounds fairly good.  The dialogue is always understandable, if sometimes a bit tinny-sounding.  Overall, the audio quality is not fantastic, but not terrible, either.

The bonus features quality - Disc 2 (4/5):

Lucky for me, I still own an original Xbox!  The Xbox-playable demo of LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy was very fun for me!  I enjoyed it so much, I've already decided to buy the game!  (But, the Xbox 360 version, though!)  The trailer for the game, while nothing spectacular, was a pleasant little way to waste 90 seconds of my time.

My overall score for this 2-Disc DVD: 3/5

I'm kind of torn in two directions about this DVD set.  On the one hand, we're given both versions of this classic film, with an entertaining audio commentary on Disc 1 and a fun (and addictive!) Xbox game demo on Disc 2.  On the other hand, the 1977 theatrical version on Disc 2 has very disappointing non-anamorphic widescreen video and merely serviceable audio.

Therefore, I'm only recommending this 2-Disc DVD to hardcore Star Wars fans like myself, who absolutely must own all-things Star Wars on DVD and Blu-Ray Disc.  For casual fans, or those who are just starting to get into the Star Wars phenomenon, I recommend instead buying the 4-Disc Special Edition DVD Trilogy set released back in 2004.  With that one, you get the Special Editions of Star Wars Episodes IV, V and VI, plus an extra DVD crammed to the gills with all sorts of cool bonus features.",1322438400,,6879,4.830624465355005

I remember watching Star Wars for the first time. Not when it first came out in the theatre, I wasn't born yet. But definitely before it became Episode IV and was the just Star Wars. I became instantly hooked, from there on out I was a diehard Star Wars fan- still am to this day! I even have the figurines from when it was released in '77, right down to the Tusken Raiders lol. And then when the next two came out, my love for all things Star Wars was cemented.

That said, when the new version of it came out, complete with revisions and touch-ups and add-on's, I was impressed. How could a Star Wars fan not be? Whether your loyalty lies with the original or not, you have to look at from an unbiased point of view. All movies from that era were grainy, dusty and so forth. To see it touched up and tweaked a bit is to be expected, especially thid day in age. Personally I love both versions.

The only complaint that I do have, is that I wish they would have seperated both versions on Episode IV-VI. But the money mahine has to be kept filled somehow I spose. Therefore my rating is as follows: Star Wars(original)= 4.5 stars & Episode IV:A New Hope(new version)= 4 stars.",1322265600,,1337,4.235294117647059

The intelligentsia loves Empire Strikes Back. They say it's because Empire is one of the only blockbuster movies that actually has a downer ending in which the bad guys win. They enjoy being contrarian. They're deluded.

The romantics love Return of the Jedi. They get all teary-eyed at the funeral pyre scene when Anakin Skywalker appears in his non-Darth Vader form at the end. They are simpering sentimental fools.

Only degenerates love Episodes I thru III. They need counseling.

The original Star Wars is without a doubt the BEST of the series. None of the other films come close. The good thing about this particular package is that Disc 2 contains the ACTUAL original, not the bogus ""enhanced"" Star Wars with the silly new graphics, symbols in themselves of all sorts of late-life regrets and insecurities on Lucas's part.

377912,4,6301773551,"Unfortunately, we still haven't got the original 1977 cinema version on DVD or Blu-Ray yet (except for the insulting non-anamorphic transfers of recent times) so this review is of the ""bastardised"" 2000's version. Albeit, with an improved (but still pointless) ""Jabba"" sequence, but it's still a pale viewing experience, when compared with the more streamlined original. Like 'Jaws' from 1975, 'Star Wars' represents the kicking off of the Summer blockbuster that has, unfortunately, diseased Hollywood for decades. However, in 1977, it was a truly spectacular event and such ""event"" movies were unheard of. 'Star Wars' was so successful, it made bucket-loads of money and knocked 'Jaws' off of it's ""top earner"" spot. It made a star out of carpenter Harrison Ford, household names out of the three leads, a multi-millionaire out of George Lucas and enabled one of the greatest trilogies ever to grace the screen.

It's funny to think now, but 'Star Wars' was very nearly a non-starter. Nobody was willing to pick it up, until 20th Century Fox took a huge gamble and threw a modest amount of money at Lucas and expected him to turn in a low budget, but respectable sci-fi flick. Little did they know that they were going to get the biggest cinema extravaganza that the movies ever produced. The studio would certainly not have figured that out from reading the script, which was a mish mash of nonsense depicting a princess in distress and a farm-boy who runs off with a wizard and a scoundrel to rescue her. The story was simple enough and rather hokey, but the vision that Lucas (and the many others involved) had, would elaborate on the paltry story and enable the viewer to buy into it. Such care was put into the visuals, that the story became believable within the realms of the world that was created, because the world that was created was filled with objects that looked used. They looked functional and operational. Gone was the sparkly ""disco"" Sci-Fi of 'Logan's Run' or the semi-future (but recognisably 70's) visions of the likes of 'Soylent Green'. Here we had a brand new world, something from ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."" It was just never done before and it carried off a generation of imaginations and made obsessive's out of millions of 70's kids. In fact, so lovingly created was the world of 'Star Wars', it still stands up today, nearly 34 years later and even surpasses the more ""modern"" prequels, simply because the world was made up of sets, models and other tangible items, rather than...er...nothing.

'Star Wars' is far from perfect though. Often, the acting is weak, the story confusing (to some people) and the editing is so fast paced, that it can leave some people behind. But it never fails to entertain. And, in this form (the director's cut as it were), it has some appallingly bad inserts, including the aforementioned ""Jabba sequence"". Most of the ""improvements"" Lucas decided to put into 'Star Wars' helped to some degree. The computer aided clean-up of the picture was a good idea, as was upping the number of spacecraft on the screen in certain scenes. But, having silly edits like ""Greedo"" firing first and ""Jabba"" meeting with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) were so inept, it made me realise that the constraints that Lucas had imposed on him, both financially and time-wise, for the original 70's production were a good thing as it forced him to rethink his ideas, instead of simply going with them. The ""Greedo"" thing is absolutely laughable and has been the subject of many a ""Han fired first"" internet outrages since it first spoiled our memories in the 90's re-release. It actually nulls Han Solo's personality to a great degree. It takes his edge off and Lucas's explanation for the change was pathetic to say the least. In short, he didn't want to present a hero of his films firing without provocation. Considering Greedo was threatening to blow him away, Solo was well within his right. Not to mention ""Greedo"" manages to miss Solo from just 2 metres away, the whole scene ends up just looking stupid. Likewise, after Solo whacks Greedo, he meets up with Jabba the Hutt in a sequence that has always bothered Lucas as he simply didn't have the money or time to film the scene in the 70's. What a pity that changed, as the resulting insert ends up being so stupid and inept, that it could nearly ruin the entire film. It's a completely unnecessary inclusion and not only that, much of the dialogue from the Greedo scene several minutes earlier is repeated! Unfortunately, these interferences were not limited to 'Star Wars'. Lucas couldn't resist messing with 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' too. The former got away with light changes, but the latter was destroyed in a similar way to 'Star Wars'.

Hopefully, we will get the original versions released on DVD, complete with cleanups and anamorphic presentations and fans can forget the ""Lucas"" versions. But, many fans feel that the 'Star Wars' saga has been wrecked, irreparably, by Lucas's misguided decisions to ""fix"" the original trilogy and produce the absolutely awful prequels, not to mention the glut of subpar cartoons, comics and books that have saturated the once excellent universe that carried away so many kids in the 70's and 80's.",1317859200,2,5280,4.851441241685144

REVIEW

This is it.  The 1977 original film(paired with an 'enhanced' version of same).  Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Sir Alec Guinness, ""Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope"" is a powerful and landmark film for generations.

The story is a model of simplicity that suggests a multitude of intricacies and hidden meanings.  At bottom, the young man Luke Skywalker forms an uneasy partnership with a shifty ally named Han Solo to rescue a princess.  The galaxy is in the grip of a murderous Empire, led by a faceless and cruel master foot soldier named Darth Vader.  Vader is one of the great villains in popular film, in this film brought to life onscreen by two people.  James Earl Jones' voice is deep and rich, yet also icy-cold when and where it needs to be.  David Prowse wears Vader's immaculate black suit very convincingly.  Luke, Han, and Princess Leia  must manage their egos and grapple with individual responsibility and personal loss to hope to defeat the powerful dark forces, which also include a sea of white-armored StormTroopers and a ruthless evil bureaucrat played by Peter Cushing.

The script carries a level of detail and maturity that is missing from every single prequel.  It is here that George Lucas massages the idea of lightsaber battles doubling as psychological revelations and exposition.  The dialogue between Sir Alec Guinness and James Earl Jones during a pivotal lightsaber battle is exemplary for dropping tantalizing clues at a shared past history between their characters.  The Force isn't an underdeveloped joke but an appropriate metaphor for religion and, most especially, spirituality.  Specifically, an intriguing rivalry develops between Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi, and Han Solo.  Performances are uniformly excellent, with special mention for Sir Alec Guinness in an Oscar-nominated turn as Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi.

If at all possible, see this movie and its immediate sequels ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" before any of the prequel movies.  This is a legendary movie, telling an engrossing story buttressed by one of John Williams' finest musical scores. The movie also features Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew as the robot twosome C-3PO and R2-D2, respectively, and Solo's large hairy growling co-pilot Chewbacca.  I love this movie.",1317254400,2,2470,5.168765743073048

It is really sad that, in 2011, I have to go to a poorly-ported bonus disc to watch one of the most influential movies of all time.  This is probably the best option I will ever have to watch the movie as it was originally made.  Unfortunately, the discs have some issues:

1.) It is 480 lines letterboxed, which means the image is very small.  You have to hit the Zoom/Stretch option to get it to fill the width of your 16:9 television.  Being non-anamorphic, it is the same quality as a LD, but significantly less quality than the original 35mm it was shot on.  This is a really bad port of the film.  Writing the data anamorphically would have made it a lot better.  There is no technological reason for it to be letterboxed.

2.) The audio has been stripped.  Star Wars was originally recorded on six track audio, but this disc only contains Dolby stereo.  Again, there is no technological reason for this decision.  The DVD would hold a 480 anamorphic image and 6.0 audio easily.

Here is where the line between ""restoration"" and ""totally messing up my childhood memories"" is drawn: 3.) the bonus disc has no restoration attempt in either picture or sound at all.  Even without adding CGI anything, modifying dialog, adding deleted content, etc., there are still a lot of modern things than could be done to this film to crisp it up.  A lot of black special effects show up as shades of gray, so you'll want to set your TV accordingly.

As for the other disc in the box, the Special Edition 2006 Version?  I threw it away.",1316995200,2,1724,4.467948717948718

377917,5,6301773551,"If you grew up on Star Wars, that is, the original Star Wars from the 70's and 80's, you must own this version!  The most important thing that it contains is on Disc 2, and it's the absolute original movie, from the title crawl to the great story supported by special effects (rather than centering around special effects like the most recent versions).  It's got everything I love about Star Wars: great acting, fantastic setting, solid story, good v. evil, and rooting for the underdog.  It's a story of how a bunch of nobodies became somebody because of a power greater than any of them could imagine.

The effects, though pedestrian by modern standards, are supported by a solid story and a believable, ""used"" universe that feels lived-in.  From the dirt on the X-Wings to the blaster-burns on the Millennium Falcon, the actors work well with their set pieces and look like they're actually on a different planet rather than, say, running around a blue-room that will later be rendered by a team of artists.

If you can't tell by now, the newer Star Wars movies don't impress me.  In fact, I consider them outside the Canon entirely and deny that they have any real connection to these original works, for which I will someday break down and write fanfic prequels myself.  Yes, this makes me a huge nerd, and probably makes some of you think less of me.  But I don't care.  Think of me as Star Wars Amish, if that makes it any better.

Anyway, if this sounds appealing to you, then buy these discs before George Lucas buys them all up and destroys them in a fascist attempt to force us to accept his ridiculous unedited vision for this universe.",1309651200,3,1649,4.593856655290103

And too Release them TWICE One Right AFTER the Other (2004-2005) on Two Different Cases. Now to Finally ACCEPT that People Do Not Like the Specials; he released the Original Theatrical Versions.

377951,5,6301773551,"Bought this for the original theatrical version and I love it.  It looks perfectly fine on a non-HD TV.  Basically it sounds, from other reviews, like it looks worse the larger it gets.  So just don't view it on a huge screen.

Fortunately, all the loud protests of fans about the limitations of this product may have kept it from selling out too soon.  Now you can pick up new copies for around $10.  This is probably the least amount of buyer's remorse I've ever had with a Star Wars movie in the last twenty years (aside from the Genndy Tartakovsky Clone War Cartoons I bought as children's gifts)

And don't look a gift horse in the mouth.  If you want to wait for George Lucas to release a cleaned up anamorphic edition of the originals, you'll never see it.  Generally if he does something, he'll use the state-of-the-art method of doing so, which takes more time and money.  Problem is, by the time he cleans, makes it anamorphic, and increases the resolution for HDTV, who knows what else he'll decide to do.  This is probably the closest thing you'll get.

This is Star Wars.  I never felt right about all the changes.  I tried to trust George Lucas.  I thought that the changes were going to make the movies blend with the then upcoming prequels.  But honestly, the entire process of seeing the special editions of the originals and then watching each prequel just chipped away at any hope I may have had.  In my opinion these movies began a decline after 1980's Empire Strikes Back.

There are no changes in the newer editions that added anything to the originals.  In fact, now that I've seen them again, the changes actually detract, some just more than others.  Movies are a collaborative effort of writers, directors, actors, special effects, music, etc.  In a sense, the time period and other conditions are also key collaborators.  Their contributions include their weaknesses and limitation.  Any piece of art, whether it's a painting, novel, or movie, is best viewed through an ""historical lens.""  Star Wars looks only a little clunky now, so it's not at all hard to see how fantastic it looked back in 1977 and for many years beyond.

My disappointment with the Star Wars Prequels was that we never saw Anikan Skywalker make any descent (slow or otherwise) to the ""Dark Side.""  Instead he makes a rash emotional decision in the last moments of the final prequel, commits horrible but uncharacteristic acts, becomes mutilated, and is placed in a black outfit.  All the time before I imagined the suit was a reflection of the man inside, now it appears that he simple was the suit.  George Lucas just doesn't have the ability to let his characters live and make mistakes or do bad things.  That's why he had to change the scene with Han shooting Greedo, and even had Luke screaming when he fell into the bottomless pit in ""Empire,"" because he didn't want people to think Luke was intentionally ending his life (he removed that change later).

I've thought this independently, and it's been said many times before, that ""George Lucas has given in to the Dark Side.""  In a way, we are witnessing the drama of Anikan succumbing to the Dark Side through George Lucas.  He's become trapped in his own creation.  He can only tinker with what he sees as flaws, instead of moving on and creating something new.

Now he plans to release all the the Star Wars movies in numerical order and in 3-D.  In a way I'm glad, because I can finally put my foot down and simply not follow this man any further.  I will never see any of these movies in 3-D.  I will probably only occasionally watch the theatrical versions, such as they are, from here on out.",1299283200,5,3656,4.603715170278638

377955,5,6301773551,"I already reviewed this movie some time back on the IMDB, but felt constrained there.  This time I'm going to let out all the stops.  So, here it goes.

You know, I really loved the theatre that was presented back in 1977 on the big screen.  I loved Star Wars.  I grew up listening to the soundtrack, and seeing the film a few times when it was rereleased in the theatres.  Is was and still is great entertainment.

But I'm not a Star Wars fan.  I truly am not.

I did not buy the action figures.  I did not buy the comics (mostly anyway), nor did I ever really get into the characters too much, though I loved imagining that far off place in a different time.  To me, that was my fandom of Star Wars.  I didn't need the games, the t-Shirts, the toys, ... bed sheets, and all the other paraphernalia that constitutes you're typical Star Wars fan.  I did not dress up as a Star Wars character for Halloween.  I did not own one of those light-saber flashlights.  I did not own the masks, any of the Super-8 films, and all the other Star Wars stuff that was put on the market.

So, why didn't I?  Because I liked the film for what it was.  I wanted to go there, but instead was happy to have the film as an experience.  I know that sounds crazy, but I think most people fall into this category.  Simply put, I'm a fan of the film and the reality presented, but I'm not ""into Star Wars"".

I don't know the characters, the circumstances beyond the great rebellion depicted in the films, nor do I have an understanding of the science and engineering of the various devices depicted in the movies.  I'm simply clueless as to the Star Wars' universe and its particulars.

And I think the reason is because Star Wars touches on a primal instinct that we all enjoy and feel attached to on an emotional level.  It's not high minded philosophy like other science fiction (Star Trek as an example).  Star Wars is basic human spirit and good verse evil type of stuff thrown up on the screen for all to enjoy.

There's a sense of reality there.  A real sense of plausibility that was married to the fantastical imagery presented to billions the world over.  And it worked.  Me, I never saw myself in any of the characters, but I think most of the characters touched us and reminded us of who we are.  In that sense I am a Star Wars fan.

I'm a Star Wars fan in the sense that this film and is sequels don't pretend to be anything else.  There's no ""hidden"" psychological agenda here.  There's no real social message encoded here, just a set of circumstances and personalities that are common enough to human history.  It's basic.  But it's also a bit juvenile.  Because there weren't any higher principles being worked with here I found the larger theme rather dry and immature.  It's great cinema, and I wouldn't trade my opening day experience back in 1977 for the world, but it's essentially an upgraded form of Saturday matinee cinema married to some magnificent visuals.  And that's why I am a fan of the film, but not a real Star Wars fan as such.

It's a play derived from material meant for a younger audience, and revamped for a slightly older folks, or rather young and old alike.  And you know what?  It works.  We have old fashioned basic filmmaking updated for an audience that was somewhat tired of cowboys and modern war; an audience that was looking towards the future or, at the very lest, to worlds beyond our troubled Earth.  A place where light and dark collide on the open battlefield, or in this case a militarized realm of outer space.  And that's what makes Star Wars such a remarkable film.  But, for all that, I'm still not a Star Wars fan.

And for those who know me, this will come as a shock, because I love some of the visuals depicted, and get excited to see and hear the films.  I truly think they're great cinema.  But again, I'm not what you would call a Star Wars fan.

I've owned the games, played them, listened to the magnificent score by John Williams, and, of course, watched the original films numerous times and enjoyed them.  But that's where I stop in my enthusiasm.  It's deep enthusiasm when I'm engaged, of that there is no doubt, but I don't carry it over to my real life, unlike the ""true"" Star Wars fan.

So, all in all I love these films as pure entertainment.  But that's about it.  Yes, I wish I could be there and run around with the characters, but I'm happy to sit with the rest of mankind and view their derring-do and other antics as an audience member, and not a character in the play.

Star Wars, the original film, is a lovely piece of film making.  It's one of the great pieces of cinema in my book.  And for that alone it's worthy of purchase.

377978,5,6301773551,"My review is of the 2004 enhanced version of this movie.

Back in 1997, to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of the release of A New Hope, an enhanced version of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope was being shown in theaters.  This enhanced version contained extra scenes, alternate takes that replace the original takes, and added CGI effects.  The reaction from fans was mixed.  Some liked the added scenes and effects, while others didn't.  Myself, I had mixed feelings about it, but my way of thinking is this:  As long as the original theatrical version is still available to the public, that's the main thing.  Thankfully, it is, but I heard it was pressed from the old laserdisc version from the 1980s and hasn't been restored.  In 2004, the enhanced versions of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi were included in the 4-DVD Star Wars Trilogy set (which includes the bonus material documentary DVD).  This is the set I own.  I like these enhanced movies as well as the untouched originals, especially if they would be restored one day.

I was the perfect age to be when A New Hope came out in 1977.  I was seven, and I remember going to the theater in May 1977 to see the movie.  I remember the beginning of the movie when the star destroyer came overhead that was chasing the rebel ship.  The sound was so powerful and the special effects were so good.  I was immediately drawn into the movie.  Then a short time later, C3PO and R2D2 appeared, then the stormtroopers, then Darth Vader.  The characters blew me away.  I was fascinated with C3PO's gold costume, the Tusken Raiders, the Jawas, and Tatooine in general.  Chewbacca was also a favorite of mine, as was Han Solo.  I also liked Greedo.  My first action figure was the Tusken Raider, then C3PO.  I collected Star Wars trading cards.  I had the first set with the turquoise border, then the set with the red border, then the orange border, then the green border, and so on.  I was hooked on this stuff.  A New Hope is what started it all.  I was equally fascinated with Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back in 1980.  Back in '77 I rooted for the rebellion.  By '80 I had turned to the dark side and liked the Empire.

While this 2004 version of A New Hope is not the original theatrical version, it does retain the same feel of the movie I saw in the theater in '77.  I must say, though, that the scene where Han Solo shoots Greedo is ridiculous.  Greedo fires at Solo from close range and MISSES and Solo barely flinches as the laser bullet goes past him and hits the wall behind him.  The scene with Jabba The Hutt by the Millennium Falcon slows down the movie somewhat, and Jabba seems too nice in the scene.  The CGI stuff that was added at Mos Eisley was too childish-looking.  It LOOKS like CGI and doesn't match the rest of the movie and really was unnecessary.  It would fit in more with The Phantom Menace.  The only exception is when the Falcon blasts out of the docking bay when stormtroopers are shooting at it.  That was a good scene.  Some of the creatures in the cantina were changed.  Example:  the werewolf was eliminated and replaced with another creature.

Once in a while there are alternate takes used that replace the original takes.  An example is when Ben Kenobi, Luke, and the two droids are in the landspeeder and are stopped by stormtroopers at Mos Eisley.  An alternate take was used when Kenobi says, ""You don't need to see his identification"".  Another example is when Kenobi is talking about the cantina and says to Luke, ""This place can be a little rough"".

All in all, the original theatrical version from '77 is certainly one of the greatest movies of all time.  There's an old saying - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  The 2004 enhanced version is fine and I like it, but it really was unneccesary because Episode IV - A New Hope was a classic to begin with.  George Lucas took advantage of modern CGI technology so he could finally make the movie as he originally envisioned it to be back in the '70s.  Unfortunately, it angers some people that he tinkered with it (including myself to a certain extent).  The argument can be made that he wanted the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V, and VI) to be more like the prequels (Episodes I, II, and III).  If you ask me, I think the prequels should have been more like the original trilogy as far as their overall look and feel, and the technology in the prequels should have been either lower than the original trilogy or at most at the same level.  I do like the prequels, though.

Even though I like these 2004 enhanced edition releases, I must say that George Lucas is not only disrespecting the fans who like the original releases and made them the massive hits they were, but he's also disrespecting the hard work of all who were involved in the making of those fine films by replacing certain scenes with either CGI or what he ""originally envisioned"".  For example, a lot of people worked very hard on the special effects for the X-Wings and TIE fighters blowing up during the Death Star battle.  What did Lucas do?  He replaced those explosions with CGI explosions that he felt looked better.  I think the original special effects in the original movies were awesome, especially for that time period.  It was groundbreaking.  George Lucas needs to offer untouched but restored versions of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi to satisfy the fans who loved those movies and made them the classics they are, not to mention bought all the merchandise associated with the movies, such as trading cards, action figures, and Halloween costumes.

This 2004 DVD has audio commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Dennis Muren, and Ben Burtt as a special feature.

I highly recommend both the untouched original theatrical version (especially if it's restored in the future) and the enhanced version of A New Hope.  The choice is yours.  Are you nostalgic or are you open-minded?",1282780800,2,5972,4.544090056285178

I put in the disc that has the Original Theatrical Version and started watching it.  I wasn't sure if i was watching the the right version because the quality is fine.  I watched it and sure enough Han Shot First and i knew i was watching the right version.  Sure i wasn't watching it on a wide screen TV but should that be the reason that we judge the whole set.  I like it because i have both versions of the movie.  The one with all the edits and the original version.  The movie itself is as good as it ever was.  If you already have Star Wars (The original trilogy) on DVD that is not this version then i don't recommend this.  But if you don't have the original trilogy then this is the perfect version.

377982,5,6301773551,"I think nostalgia is clouding your judgement... Do you really think that the aliens in the cantina for example look more realistic than the Navi in Avatar or that Bespin looks more realistic than Minis Tirith in Lord of the Rings?

It all comes down to how the effects are used. That has not changed one bit since the days of the original Star Wars. There was a hell of a lot of movies in the seventies and eighties with atrocious special effects done practically. Just as there are a lot of movies today with atrocious effects done digitally.

Do you think those old movies with stop motion dinosaurs looked more realistic than the T-Rex in Jurassic Park? That those old Titanic movies that sunk a model boat looked more realistic than the sinking in James Cameron's movie? That 'The Sands Of Iwo Jima' had more a realistic looking war than 'Letters From Iwo Jima'?

""I'm sure you can think of some, like the new King Kong or Spiderman Trilogy, if anyone thinks that crap looked real you need your vision checked.""

Yeah, because the stop motion puppet in the 1933 King Kong and Superman hanging by wires in front of a green screen were sooooo much more realistic.

The problem is not with modern effects. The problem is that now that anything can be done easily and simply using CGI they have a tendency to go way overboard to the point where it doesnt look real anymore. When they were doing things practically they were forced by necessity to keep things grounded.",1276732800,,1468,4.566539923954372

377984,5,6301773551,"This is the first Star Wars film. The dialogue is very funny, the special effects are great, the costumes of the aliens are great and there is lots of action.

The movie has a fine performance by Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's the only really serious character in the film and he gives it class.  The hero of the film is Luke Skywalker played well by Mark Hamill.

The movie starts with a powerful camera shot from underneath a Imperial Star Destroyer chasing a smaller Rebel ship. This hooked me into the movie. In the rebel ship is Princess Leia who is putting information in the database of a droid called R2D2. Princess Leia is played by Carrie Fischer. Carrie Fischer is actually a beautiful and intelligent woman but they give her a funny hairstyle in the movie so, unfortunately, you can't tell. The droid R2D2 and another droid C3PO exit the craft in an escape pod which falls to the surface of planet Tatooine. Princess Leia is knocked out by a blast from a blaster set at stun and is taken prisoner by Darth Vader who will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission.

James Earl Jones did a great voice over for Darth Vader. I also liked his performance as the villain Thulsa Doom in ""Conan the Barbarian"". Darth Vader's costume is also really cool and I would definitely say that Darth Vader is one of the best villains in movie history if not the best. He's portrayed as a greatly to be feared ruthless imperialistic general and hunter of rebels with a touch of Jedi mysticism. The other great imperial villain in the movie is Grand Moff Tarkin played by the great actor Peter Cushing.

The two other characters in the movie are Han Solo and Chewbaca. Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, provides a lot of laughs. His arguments with Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi are really funny. He's a smuggler who has run-ins with the Empire and has a price on his head for a gambling debt owed to Jabba the Hut. He hangs out with Chewbaca, a tall alien covered with fur, and has no obligations to anyone and looks out for himself.

The film culminates with a great space battle with imperial and rebel ships flying and shooting at each other all over the place. The part where there is a first person view of an X-wing going into a trench of the Death Star had me hanging onto my seat.

Overall, this movie is science fiction at its most exciting and funnest and I recommend it greatly.",1276214400,,2395,4.466819221967963

378010,5,6301773551,"Man, I wish I had been around to see this when it was originally released to theaters.  I was born in 1989, twelve years too late for that.  I had to settle for seeing it in 1997 with new improved special effects.  This movie set the standard for what makes a good Science Fiction movie, and it was, at the time, the first movie in a few years that wasn't depressing and unpleasant to watch (this was the seventies after all).  Everything about this movie was perfect, from the plot (which at the time wasn't generic, we've had so many inferior remakes of this storyline, from Eragon to Legend of the Seeker) to the characters, to the classic alien battle scenes.

 The characters were all amazing.  Luke Skywalker is the youthful protagonist who embarks on a quest to become a Jedi Knight and follow in his father's footsteps.  We get to follow the journey Luke makes from boy to man over the course of these three films.  Luke is a very good protagonist because he's not infallible.  He slips up and makes mistakes, even in Return of the Jedi when he's become a lot more mature.  Princess Leia is the quick-witted damsel-in-distress.  Artoo and Threepio provide great comic relief, and Obi-Wan is the wise old warrior/mentor/father figure.  But my two favorite characters in this series, and definitely two of the best characters in movie history are Darth Vader and Han Solo.  Darth Vader is one of the best villians in movie history.  We don't see a whole lot of him in this movie, unfortunately.  It wasn't until Empire Strikes Back that we really see how great a villian he is.  Han Solo is a wise-cracking mercenary smuggler who eventually realizes he can do more than just make money for himself, he can help the Rebel Alliance.  His journey is arguably just as interesting as Luke's.  His jokes and nicknames are hilarious.

 The plot of this movie is very good.  Many people argue that this is a good romp, nothing more.  This was not a generic storyline at the time of its original release.  It is true that Lucas pulled many different ideas from different stories, but it is only because so many different people have tried to rip this off that many people consider it to be generic.  There really isn't a lot to say about this movie.  I love it, ever since I was a kid.  I don't really like any Sci-fi that was made before this (for instance Lost in Space and the original Star Trek series).  This is a great movie, and if you haven't seen it then go rent it.",1271808000,,2472,4.506756756756757

378018,5,6301773551,"George Lucas' space adventure that revolutionized science fiction film-making.

Truly a film masterpiece.  It takes a standard tale of love and war, patriotism and honor and creates something special.  Truly a sum of its parts!

Words scan across the screen at the start, similar to the old Buck Rogers and other serials of the mid-twentieth century.  And like those films, it takes place in a universe of extraordinary technology.  But not of the future!  Of the past!  Sure, why not?  Why would there not be galaxies that are so old as to predate our own civilization, so far, far away?

The princess of the piece, at risk of her life, sends a secret message through her droid (little robot guy, used in manufacturing and pilot control) and send them off to a desert planet, orbiting a twin star system.  In many ways, reminded me of Frank Herbert's Dune.  In fact, there is a skeleton of a Sandworm!  Coincidence?

I won't go over the whole plot here.  If you have not yet seen Star Wars, please do.  Luke Skywalker, oblivious to his past heritage, is just a farm boy who desires someday to be a soldier, a freedom-fighter.  But alas, he will most likely be like his Uncle Owen, living on a backward planet, doing some hydroponics and maybe even play in the  Mos Isely band.  Did they ever do kareoke?

The death of his aunt and uncle at the hands of the Empire, with the blackened corpses of his aunt and uncle (quite horrific for a PG film, actually) fires up Luke.  He desires revenge.

So we have the plot thicken:  A force of evil, a backward boy with dreams, galavnized by the death of his only family but no place to put forward his intentions of revenge.  He meets Obi-Wan and thinks the princess is hot.  Ah, if he only knew.

And the story goes.  George Lucas, director of such hits up to that time of the powerful THX-1138 and the hilarious American Graffiti, turned out what was in fact the turning point in science fiction cinema, just by taking a fun popcorn plot with a simple yet powerful story and creating a revolution.

I have read other stories of corrupt empires both past and present and of the lives of men and women who fought, avenged and struck back in the name of freedom.  The Roman Empire (it's rise and fall) and Isaac Asimov's Harry Seldon in The Foundation Trilogy come to mind, and even to some extent Frank Herbert's Dune series.

Star Wars is a classic movie that will impress generations with its majestic good vs. evil story. The movie itself deserves 10 out of Amazon's 5 stars. People will always love this timeless movie.

Background:
As most Star Wars fans know, George Lucas decided in the 1990s that technology has finally caught up with his vision. He re-released it in theaters in 1997 with these new effects and called it Star Wars: Special Edition. Of course, Lucas caused controversy by deciding to make the Special Edition definitive and deciding to never release the original unaltered award-winning version. In 2004, George Lucas released an even more improved Star Wars (Super Special Edition). Because the unaltered version was not released on DVD, bootlegs containing transfers from the laserdiscs got spread. George Lucas finally relented and released the unaltered version on DVD in 2006. It was named by fans George Original Unaltered Trilogy (GOUT).

Technical:
Unfortunately, Star Wars GOUT is not sourced from a new high definition transfer as some expected. Instead, it is sourced from a 1993 laserdisc master with an original crawl ironically from the best film in existence. This release is non-anamporphic and uses the stereo laserdisc audio instead of the original theatrical audio. It looks terrible on a widescreen TV. It is however better than most bootlegs because it is sourced not from a laserdisc copy but the laserdisc master. The opening crawl sourced from the best film begs the question why George Lucas did not source GOUT from the anamporphic best film and rayher chose to source it from the laserdisc master. Additionally, GOUT is not the main movie but instead a bonus feature disc of another release of the Star Wars: Super Special Edition. Compared to the Super Special Edition's quality, GOUT is an outrage. Basically, GOUT is the least George Lucas could do to release the original unaltered trilogy without being worse quality than the bootlegs.",1251504000,3,1976,5.133540372670807
378039,5,6301773551,"Note- for this and the subsequent films, I will be reviewing the theatrical releases, not the re-released special editions.

Science fiction was hugely popular in the 50s with the Jet Age and the Space Race. There were even the Flash Gordon serials earlier than that. But once the sixties hit, especially the late sixties, movie makers went with more realistic stories. I know 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Trek were made in that time frame, but they were still along telling a more realistic (for that genre anyway) story. Then this came along! With cutting edge special effects (for the time) and an interesting story made this one of the highest grossing films in  history. And also influenced the people behind the Bond films (FYEO was supposed to be after TSWLM but due to the popularity of this, was pushed back and MR was filmed instead.) and the people behind Star Trek (though two totally different things, this did influence them to change the Phase Two TV project into the first film).

That's enough backstory. The acting is better than what we'd get in episodes 2 and 3 (especially from Hayden Christensen). Mark Hamill, better known today as the voice of the Joker on the various DCAU projects, plays Luke Skywalker with innocence and sincerity as we see the young hero thrust from his average lifestyle into the battle to save the galaxy. Harrison Ford plays Han Solo with a cockiness yet is the rogue with a heart of gold (I think he was just warming up for Indiana Jones). Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, I think though I maybe wrong, is the first female movie character during the women's libs of the seventies to be able to take charge of a situation (like during the rescue in the prison cell) and hold her own in a gun fight. Darth Vader (suit actor David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) is one of the more intimidating villains in cinema history and just as formidable in a lightsaber duel and a dog fight in space. Along with Tarkin, played by an impressive Peter Cushing, is almost as cold as Vader himself (since Tarkin is pretty much ordering Vader around in this), especially when he threatens Leia to blow up Alderaan. And lastly, Alec Guinness plays Obi-Wan Kenobi as a gentle, caring teacher to Luke though an old man, can still be pretty formidable in a fight. And the only human character who actually retains any dignity with his portrayal in the recent films. Again the incomprable John Williams is at the conductor's position, with another rousing score of action and suspense, though this is when his movie scores started to share some similar cues (most, if not all his scores are done by the London Symphony Orchestra).

Now I will say that I saw the Special Editions before I saw the original prints and I did enjoy them. But after seeing the original release (though it should've recieved the same treatment that the other editions got), I will say that it is the superior version. Lucas needs to stop ""improving"" his movies and leave them the way they are (like his Young Indiana Jones series, I heard they filmed new stuff and removed whole episodes from continuity). He totally dishonors all the work that went into these original productions and only does it so he can re-release it on whatever video format and make a profit. I don't think he cares so much for the most popular film in his vault.",1250467200,,3349,4.652027027027027
378040,5,6301773551,"The original ""Star Wars"" (A New Hope) is by far the best of all the ""Star Wars"" six film series. There are many memorable moments. The special edition of 1997 updated the film in line with modern filmaking techniques.",1247529600,,217,4.589743589743589

You can view this ""full-size"" on your 16x9 TV by setting your DVD player's HDMI output to 3x4/pillar-box if necessary, and then setting your TV to ""zoom"" so that the screen is filled side to side with the picture. There will be slim black bars on the top and bottom, just as there are on anamorphic DVD's with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

Even with the zoom in effect, the picture is crystal clear and the color great. I'm using an upconvert DVD player with HDMI output (1080p), and a 50-inch plasma HD television. Some have said in reviews that the picture quality is poor, even ""VHS quality"", but that's totally false. I've read that the originals here were taken from the laser-disc masters done in the early 90's; well, they look great however they were sourced. The sound is Dolby 2.0 Stereo (as indicated on the package) and sounds excellent. I get some center-channel and sub-woofer action as well as the stereo music and sound-effects on my system.

If a blu-ray/HD version is ever issued, that will be great and an improvement; but this is the only way to get the original films on DVD at this time, and they look great, so this set is essential for fans who saw these movies in theatres when they were released between 1977 and 1983 and want to see them once again in their original glory.",1245369600,3,1478,4.637404580152672

To shell out anything over $10 for this particular movie, one you can watch for free on Spike, Science Fiction channel or Blockbuster, you all must be retarded.

378072,5,6301773551,"I was born in April of 1972. My earliest memory is of the Bicentennial celebrations. I seem to remember watching people playing around with fireworks at our neighbor's house. But I'm not 100% sure these memories are accurate.

The first memory I know for sure is accurate is seeing ""Star Wars"" in 1977. This was back when it was just ""Star Wars"". Not ""Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope"". No, it was just a simple, single film.

But what a film it was! I am pretty sure I'd seen movies in theatres before this one, but I don't remember doing so. The first movie I remember seeing after this one is ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". When I got a little older, I remember being very happy every time I went to visit my Aunt Judy because she had HBO, and there was a decent chance they'd be showing Star Wars, so I'd get to see it again. When Christmas and birthdays rolled around, one of the things I'd always ask for was ""Star Wars"" action figures. My mom always made me use a magic marker to color their feet black so they wouldn't get mixed up with any owned by any of the neighbor kids.

Through the 1980's a lot of my life centered around the ""Star Wars"" films. I remember seeing ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" when they were first in theatres. Hell, I've even seen the abortion best known to the world as The Star Wars Holiday Special!

I provide this rather lengthy digression because I want to make it clear that this movie has had a huge impact on my life, and that's something reasonably common to my generation. We're called ""Generation X"", but in many ways we're really the ""Star Wars"" Generation. The earliest members of the generation would've been only twelve or thirteen when the first movie came out. The last ones were born when ""Return of the Jedi"" was still fresh.

With Star Wars George Lucas managed to take several diverse elements (mythology, Japanese cinema, westerns, etc), and combine them into a film that was truly universal in nature. You can take the movie to just about anywhere in the world and people will recognize elements familiar to them, even if they've never seen the movie before.

Even now, thirty-one years after the movie first premired, it's casting a shadow over the world of film. Along with such movies as ""The Birth of a Nation"" and ""Citizen Kane"", it completely recreated the way movies are made. Certainly it's one of the most influential films ever made. It's also far more accessible than either of those other two great movies.

Of course no real reflection on this movie could go by without taking notice of the amazing score by John Williams. Even now, I bet you can remember the sound of the music playing as Luke looked out at the twin suns setting, or the music playing as everyone but Chewbacca got medals, and of course you'll remember the amazing theme to the film's opening titles. The film's score gave a gravitas to science fiction music that had been previously reached only by ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" (a film not nearly as good and very overrated), and even that movie's score was made impressive by the fact that it was lifted from the classical masters.

Of course back in 1997, many fans screamed, ""Murther! Murther most foul!"" when George Lucas released the special edition versions of the movies with enhanced special effects and the like. Me, I like the special edition versions of all three movies, especially the first. They don't change the story any, they are prettier to look at, and it was nice to see the movies in the theatres again.

The film is not without flaws. The dialogue is a little clunky and wooden (to those bitching about the prequels being shallow on the dialogue, I suggest you go back and listen to the first three films again). The characters are pretty one-dimensional for the most part.

But despite those flaws, the movie is spectacular, and even now has an impact that cannot be underestimated. I remember a few years ago, after it had first come out on DVD, I had a couple friends over for Christmas. We were talking, playing video games and just generally goofing around. While we were eating, I popped on the movie, and even though we'd all seen it a half a gazillion times, we were still enthralled and gave it our almost undivided attention to a film that came out in 1977. Now that's praise!

This isn't the best film in the sextology. That honor goes to The Empire Strikes Back. But it is the most important film, and one of the best movies ever made.

With this DVD you get the original film and you get the special edition version that was created for the original DVD release back in 2004. Which is better? Eh, honestly I prefer the special edition version, but that's just me. Either way, it's a wonderful buy.",1221091200,2,4739,4.5362997658079625
378073,5,6301773551,"With Episode 2 currently in the theaters, and many people complaining about how shallow that movie is, and how unbelievable the story and how much better the original trilogy was etc, I think it's time to make a comment.  First of all, Star Wars movies have NEVER,EVER,EVER had a good story. They're basically about the age-old tale of good vs. evil, set in various locations in a galaxy far far away. The plot is usually full of holes, the whole thing often depends on extreme coincidences and every Imperial superweapon has a verious obvious flaw that any apprentice engineer could have found in five minutes. This movie, Episode 4, is probably the most basic of them all. The main point is, Star Wars was never SUPPOSED to be about the story. It's basically a lot of (brilliant) nonsense put together, and it works just fine because the makers know that it's nonsense and make the best of it. That being said, the level of creativity in making up all those aliens, vehicles, space ships etc. is unmatched.  When we look at Episode 4 specifically, we see a corny story full of lucky escapes and loose ends about a farmboy saving a princess, and the Universe too, while he is at it. The acting is nothing special, the dialogue can be god-awful at times (OK, not a bad as Episode 1), and the first hour of the movie is quite slow. But it's still a lot of fun ! Star Wars is entertainment and escapism in it's purest form. It was 25 years ago and it still is.",1219968000,,1458,4.456928838951311
378074,2,6301773551,"With this set you get both movies, the main movie is the re-worked edition with all the silly additions, like the cartoon Jaba talking to Han; and the bonus disk is the old 1977 edition without all that crap. The ""Special"" Edition looks great and sounds great. The old ""Un-Special"" Edition looks and sounds horrible, its widescreen, but it looks like someone copied it from a vhs version. I was quite sad when I shove this in my DVD to watch just to get a really bad (I mean REALLY bad) copy of my favorite movie. So if you already have the ""Special Edition"" and want the original 1977 version, I can't say its worth spending money on this.
EDIT DEC 2010 - This is a great movie nevertheless, even the re-done version is worth a watch. But the quality of the original unedited version of the movie is really bad and in my opinion not worth buying yet another version of this movie. One can only hope that one day they release a remastered version of the originals without the cgi edits.",1219708800,3,986,4.39344262295082
378075,5,6301773551,"What do you look for in a STAR WARS DVD?

I have some friends who several years ago were visiting China and saw that the STAR WARS Trilogy was available there on DVD.  This was almost a year before it was available in the United States.  My friends didn't care that it came with Chinese subtitles.  They just wanted STAR WARS on DVD and couldn't wait for a U.S. edition.

Likewise, there were many people like myself who simply wanted just the original movies that we saw in theaters as kids -- the original movies on DVD.  If George Lucas wanted to throw in an extra special edition disc, or making-of, or what-have-you, then that would be fine.  But that's why I didn't rush out and buy the STAR WARS Trilogy when it was first released -- because I knew it was not going to be the real STAR WARS.  And I knew that eventually Lucas would release the originals.  And I was willing to wait it out.

Is there another version which may someday catch my eye?  Perhaps.  I wouldn't mind owning a STAR WARS edition that contained all of the edited footage between Luke and Biggs on Tatooine.  Or perhaps they may one day decide to re-do the Han Solo/Jabba the Hutt scene with a Jabba that looks like Jabba in RETURN OF THE JEDI.  So, as far as ""special editions"" are concerned, I have no problem with adding new stuff, as long as it is the stuff that was originally filmed and not some useless musical number in Jabba the Hutt's palace (i.e. RETURN OF THE JEDI).

I suppose the best news is for those who enjoy having the movies revamped and ""technologically updated"" every few years.  Because George Lucas doesn't seem to be slowing down in that area at all.  He simply will not leave well enough alone.

But one thing that I hope will never change is the end.  STAR WAR EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE must always end with a victorious applause for our heroes.",1219536000,,1847,4.363636363636363

378087,5,6301773551,"Star Wars ranked number 15 on the AFI's top 100 list of Amberican films. It's been the inspiration of countless film-makers, writers, video game programmers, and peopel who dream of becoming the ""next George Lucas"".

It's  a simple story of good vs. evil and Imperialism vs. Rebellion, a boy's coming of age, and the power of the spiritual in a universe that makes a big show of techneological force. But somehow it has come to mean much more than that.

The making of Star Wars was part genius and part luck, and I've read the making of books to prove it. Part of you wants to say that George Lucas would have made a masterpiece no matter what and another part of you looks a the rough cut of the film and knows it could have been just another space fantasy film, but all rights should have been. No matter how it got made, Star Wars is a perfect example of what can go right in a film to make it transcend its genre.

The cinematography is wonderful. The editing is long where it needs to be, short where it needs to be. The acting is endearing (if silly and cheesy at times). The characters are archtypes, not stereotypes. The special effects are the best of what stop-motion can accomplish, legendary. The music is my pick for the greatest movie soundtrack of all time (and I've listened to it plenty). The script may not be shakespeare, but it's still great stuff. Everyone can relate to these characters, and many feel almost as if they knew them themselves. A lot of people love Han Solo. As for me, Luke Skywalker was always my hero.

I think inside of most people there is a hero who longs to make a difference in the world, to fight against evil and triumph with their friends to thunderous applause. Everyone wants to be that hero of a thousand faces. George Lucas gave us the ability to see that hero on the big screen, as never before.

You could write whole books about the influence that Star Wars has had on the space fantasy genre, blockbuster movies, and people around the world. Countless debate has gone back and forth on continuity, expanded storylines, what characters, books, and films influenced the film's making, and of course, whether the widescreen, unaltered, or special editions are the best way to watch. People will even argue whether or not the three prequels should be considered part of the official story and Star Wars Universe. But for all that, the original Star Wars stands on its own, as a cinematic achievement and a cultural one, and as a doorway that opened countless imaginations.

The story is universal. It has been told many times before. A young boy dreams of becoming a hero and fighting against evil, with the help of a mentor he rescues a princess and saves the day. I think deep down just about everyone loves this story. This movie isn't perfect. No movie is. Someday this story will be told better. But for now, Star Wars is the definitive space fantasy for the entire planet.",1216166400,,2930,4.548387096774194

The only aspect of the storyline that really captured my interest was the Jedi Knights with their mystical connection to ""The Force' and the extraordinary powers that come by utilizing it.

Looking at the original version now 31 years later it appears obviously dated (as would be expected) and a little overly comedic for my personal tastes. However with or without my consent the legacy of this film cannot be denied. The iconic images of Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo, the John Williams soundtrack and much of the dialogue and robotic sound effects have become so imbeded in our consciousness that they instill comfort and assurance when viewed or heard.

George Lucas has declared that there will not be anymore Star Wars episodes/movies because it is too time consuming, too much trouble, and perhaps because he has run out of ideas?  Anyway, I have declared the following 9 episodes to now be the official complete set in the chronicle series and regardless of what anyone says, it cannot and will not be changed. Ever.  Or until George Lucas gets back on his medicine and off his high horse, and realizes he has failed in presenting the complete 9 episodes he promised years ago, and makes amends by giving us the last trilogy we deserve. We need closure and so here it is:

1. The Phantom Menace (1999) - Episode One

2. Attack Of The Clones (2002) - Episode Two

3. Revenge Of The Sith (2005) - Episode Three

4. A New Hope (1977) - Episode Four

5. The Star Wars Holiday Special (aka Life Day Celebration)
  (Nov. 1978) - Episode Five.
  (Face it, this tv special featured the same characters from the
  series- Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fischer, R2D2, C3PO,
  Chewbacca, etc., and it isn't some lame cartoon, and actually has
  a plot- therefore, it is part of the continuing storyline.)

6. The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - Episode Six

7. Return Of The Jedi (1983) - Episode Seven

8. Ewoks Adventure: Caravan Of Courage (1984) - Episode Eight

9. Ewoks Adventure: The Battle For Endor (1985) - Episode Nine
  (Both of the Ewoks movies were originally shown on tv, and are
  now available as a 2-on-1 dvd.  If they played such a big part
  in Return Of The Jedi, then why can't these 2 movies be part of
  the continuing story line?  They aren't lame cartoons, they both
  have plots, and therefore, must be accepted as episodes 8 and 9.)

There really is no point in making Star Wars a tv series (in place of giving us the real last trilogy set) because we already have a Star Trek,
Stargate, and Battlestar Gallactica.  So I declare the above list of 9
episodes to now be the official set of 9 in the chronicle series and it cannot and will not ever be changed. So take that George Lucas! :P

What is there to say about this movie? it launched a new hope in Sci-fi and fantasy movies, it started out as an idea by George Lucas when he wrote the script, story and even created the SW universe as he wanted to sell this to Universal or United Artist. Then later, 20th Century Fox bought the rights to his movie and a year later the film was finished and had an unexpected success. The film was embraced by both audiences and critics as it as a masterpiece unlike anything they ever seen, a phenomeneon was born.

1) Bad video encode. I can't believe this is the same copy that went to laser disc. Blocky lines for fine details (like ceilings and the front of robots), and persistent ""noise"" over the video over all reducing crispness. I won't get all ""black helicopters"" here, but I've seen the laser disc copies and they wen't this bad.

2) Missing dialog. While there are lots of scenes ethat bring back memories for me, I've always loved C3-PO telling R2-D2 to ""switch off"". Oddly, this was edited out in the ""1977"" version DVD.

3) The re-release is now a great looking coaster.

4) Lastly, I remember being in Virgin Megastore in the 90's and seeing the CAD versions. I had to do some digging in WikiPedia but found this:

""In 1993, the Star Wars Trilogy: The Definitive Collection box set was released.

My ultimate STAR WARS-A NEW HOPE experience was my original screening in a great sound and extra large screen theater in CT in 1977. We simply were just not accustomed to that kind of sci-fi in 1977.

The 3 films cost me 48 Australian dollars. I agree Lucas has handled the original series contemptuously given many aficionados have widescreens, but I and many others do not.

Given the bad reviews, I was expecting the original feature to be woefully hazy and grainy, but it is sharp and clear as any original TV broadcast, if not a little better (and of course in the original theatre widescreen ratio - no cropping to fit the TV screen). Also you can have subtitles on the original feature - which filled in a lot of dialogue I missed and was really good to comprehend the entire movie for the first time.

The quality of the disc 2 original is OK, but you need to know that the picture is not anamorphic. What this means in simple terms is that on a widescreen TV you get black bars top and bottom as well as right and left, unless you use your TV's zoom option.

378207,5,6301773551,"Okay, everyone knows that ""Star Wars"" was a seminal motion picture.  It was the biggest thing in 1977, it has influenced countless movies and tv shows that have come after...Heck, in the early 2000's (don't ask me which year, I forget...look it up!) it was voted the #1 movie of all time by Empire Magazine.  (Of course, it's a populist poll, I don't necessarily agree with it, but I see where they were coming from.)

But are we talking about some revamped version from 1997?  Or the new add-on's from 2004?

No, we're talking about the original, from 1977.

I'm getting more and more amused by people on here that call the people loving the orginal ""reactionaries"" (or something less, if they don't know that term) because we're against the way Lucas keeps messing with the movie.  They act as if we're idiots, falling for wanting to keep the movie the same as it was.

Excuse me?  Who's falling for what?

If the movie had never been tampered with, if Lucas had always kept the original the way it was, chances are you guys still would be in love with it!  That movie has never to this day been outclassed or outmoded.

You guys are the ones falling for all the new stuff.  There was never any need for ANY of it.

""Star Wars"" made history, and invented a whole new way of looking at movies.  It's a wonderful movie, and it was a ground-breaking movie.

Every time Lucas messes with it again, he takes away some of that history.  After all, mess with it enough, and it will be hard to understand how it was ground-breaking in the first place.

Leave it as it was, and you can see how other movies tried to live up to its promise.  Continue to update it, and no movies from the 80's or 90's will even seem to come close.

And, as I said, it was (and is!) wonderful, as it was back then.

We're not the ones that are suckers for old stuff.

You guys are getting suckered into new stuff.

(Of course, I'm commenting on the original movie itself, not this particular transfer...which, from other comments on here, would seem to be pretty shoddy.

One of the most viewed reviews (by Kory) explains the difference between regular widescreen and anamorphic widescreen and how annoying is to watch the 1977 film with black bars surrounding the whole picture (top, bottom, left and right).

Could Lucasfilm have released something better than this? Definitely. This limited edition of the star wars trilogy is the same from 2004, the difference now is that one of the ""bonus materials"" (what is that supposed to mean?) is the original release, no digital Jabba, Han shooting first, Ewoks singing at the end of `Jedi' and the original phantom of Anakin Skywalker. It took only 2 years for this release after Lucas stated he would not be releasing the original versions. Now he releases this and says he will not remaster them, which can only mean we have to wait another couple years to have the original versions remastered.

I agree with those that believe Lucas disrespected his original films, for a company that is the one to set the quality standard in movie releases (ILM and THX) this is a poorly done job, Dolby 2.0 surround, not remastered and non anamorphic! They did a superb job remastering the special editions, try watching the special edition and then compare it to this DVD release, the difference is abysmal, I tried to watch this in my widescreen TV and had to use the zoom feature as it is not enhanced for anamorphic widescreen which only made the quality of the image look worse.

Why did I purchase these then? Well, I, like many fans, still kept VHS copies of the original trilogy before the special edition, the VHS image was not anamorphic, not remastered and the format is almost extinct. I see this release as a digital version of those VHS films, I believe this DVD will last longer than my old VHS copies and plus, I got them at the price of $9.99 each (and can be found cheaper) I can finally get rid of the old VHS and keep these digital versions of the original films.

It is rumored that a complete collection is to be released later this year commemorating the 30th anniversary, it will probably have the original editions remastered, however, I do not intend to purchase that, enough is enough, I had always waited to see a DVD release of the original trilogy, well, it may not be the best but it is finally here. Over the years I've learned that Lucas will always have `never before seen' additional material to include in every single new release he plans. I have the special edition (remastered as it is) and these limited original versions copied from the laser disc release.

Hats off and an endearing bow to you Mr. Lucas! How could you have ever known that you had created a phenomenon. The writing deserved the Pulitzer in my opinion. And as a writer, I know it can be most difficult to lay the whole story out on parchment when it roams in your mind for what seems an eternity. . . but when it is finally adapted to parchment, a masterpiece is thus born. The added element of glory, as I can only imagine, is to finally see the tale adapted to film and to live thru it's grand success.

The magical accending words that opened this phenomenon back on May 25th, 1977 @ SpringField Mall (VA) theatres; sent this 13 yr old 70's child into an endless STAR WARS fandom. I became instantly obsessed with bubble gum trading cards, comic books, action figures, Jedi Knights and Light Sabers.

Still after all these years and with the enhancement of special effects, I have and will evermore enjoy STAR WARS- A NEW HOPE. Always will I remember the monumental movie making experience it gave leading us into the 21st century.

May The FORCE be with you . . . as it has been with me for over 30 years.

378210,1,6301773551,"I agree with any of a number of previous reviewers: Would somebody PLEASE take STAR WARS away from George Lucas before he ruins it completely?

Like Francis Ford Coppola, who messed with THE GODFATHER trilogy over and over again trying to ""perfect"" it, Lucas keeps coming back to the original STAR WARS trilogy and adding enhanced effects and formerly deleted scenes.

In what is now known as STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE, (let me catch my breath a minute, please), Lucas decided to add creatures to the Mos Eiseley spaceport scene, alter the classic cantina scene, throw in a scene between Jabba the Hutt and Han Solo in the hangar of the ""Millennium Falcon,"" add a sappy reunion scene between Biggs and Luke just before the Battle of Yavin, make the battle scene explosions more ""dramatic,"" do a score of other little tweaks, and clean up the print.

Lucas has done this so many times over the past three decades that it's now impossible to figure out which film is the ""real"" STAR WARS. Of all the questionable ""improvements"" he's made, cleaning up the print is the only worthwhile effort. Most of the added scenes add nothing to the film, the ""extra"" creatures are interesting but unnecessary, and some of the changes  actually degrade the movie, because the dialogue is repetitious. For example:

IN THE CANTINA:

Greedo---Jabba has no use for smugglers who dump their cargoes at the first sign of an Imperial ship.

Han---Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?

and

IN THE HANGAR:

Jabba--- I have no use for smugglers who dump their cargoes at the first sign of an Imperial ship.

Han---Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?

Not only was it repetitious, but the hangar scene immediately followed the cantina scene, making the repetition even more obvious. DEAR LORD, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, MR. LUCAS??????

Fortunately, this two-disc set contains the original theatrical release with all the nicks and imperfections it was born with. The print's a bit dim, and the special effects are showing their limitations after thirty years, but this is the STAR WARS that will remain STAR WARS. It is what it is, and it never needed changes. Given the immense amount of material that has grown up around STAR WARS since it was first released, Lucas would have been smarter to release one or the other or both versions as he did, but added an Extras disc with all kinds of ""The Making Of.."" and ""The Legacy Of..."" goodies. I was disappointed that this isn't that set.

I was one of the first people to see STAR WARS when it debuted in the summer of 1977. At age 17, this now-classic movie became and remains a benchmark of an era in my life. While I never became a ""Jedihead"" (the original tag for the STAR WARS version of a Trekkie), I liked the film a great deal.

STAR WARS is not CITIZEN KANE IN OUTER SPACE. It's not a ""great"" film, but it is a true ""classic."" At the end of the first film you might even wonder what all the hype was about. Yet the movie has a engaging and endearing quality that makes you want to keep coming back for more, the true basis of success and the core of meaningfulness for any story. STAR WARS is clearly derivative. THE LORD OF THE RINGS has a ""Dark Lord."" STAR WARS has a ""Dark Lord of the Sith."" Lightsabers are yet another nod to the film's Sword & Sorcery roots, as is the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (a little Gandalf, anyone?). STAR WARS' ""Corellians"" appear in Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION as ""Korellians"", and ""Han Solo"" is also there as ""Hari Seldon."" The space war elements are a mishmash of STAR TREK, FORBIDDEN PLANET, AMAZING STORIES, pulp fiction, and a hundred other sources. George Lucas was able to take these well-used pieces and combine them into something that is both very original and yet archetypal.

STAR WARS is a sci-fi retelling of the Mythos of the young Hero. Aided by a mentor (Obi-Wan), an older, more seasoned companion (Han), and his own court jesters (See Threepio and Artoo Detoo), the young Hero (Luke) is introduced to his special (Jedi) birthright, saves the beautiful Princess (Leia) from the clutches of Evil (Darth Vader), and then must confront that Evil himself (the Battle of Yavin).

Since STAR WARS is so mythic and archetypal, it survives some really bad acting by the background characters, a few missed beats here and there, and even Lucas's post-theatrical obsessive-compulsive changes to remain a modern classic.

FIVE STARS FOR ""STAR WARS"", ONE STAR FOR LUCAS' DECISION (OBSESSION?) TO ""IMPROVE"" IT.",1181174400,9,4527,4.694444444444445
378211,4,6301773551,"My fondest memory of ""Star Wars"" in 1977 was going to a special preview screening at a mall in Kansas City (nyah-nyah-nyah... I saw it before you did!) with some adult companions in tow... Opinion pollsters were crawling all over the mall, interviewing people about the film (and offering them a few bucks for their time!) and one of the guys I saw with, a hippie named Kirk, took the poll, got his silver dollar and told the guy that the special effects were amazing.  The thing was, we were still wandering around the mall, waiting for the second show... and hadn't seen the movie yet!  It didn't matter -- Kirk was just telling the guy what he wanted to hear... And besides, it was true: for the time, the special effects were great!

Like many people of my generation, I saw ""Star Wars"" several times that summer (seven times, total, I think...) though I didn't geek out on the sequels and drifted away from the fold as I got older.  Still, I read about George Lucas's obstinant refusal to reissue the original '77 version with something close to revulsion.  So what if he's the film's creator?  Does that really give him the right to edit history, and to try and make people believe the first ""Star Wars"" film -- a watershed in global pop culture -- was something different than it really was?  And besides, wasn't a huge part of the charm of the series how darn rickety the first film was?  When I finally saw the altered (1997) ""special edition,"" I was shocked at how clumsy and garish Lucas' digital updates were -- did he really think these were improvements?  Oh, well.  Nothing to get worked up about, I guess.

I'm glad, though, that the original 1977 version is available again, and that modern viewers can see what the movie really looked like, more or less, back when it packed kids into the malls and moviehouses during the disco era.  Okay, maybe there are technical limitations and maybe Lucas is (inexplicably) feuding with his fan base, but at least having *some* unaltered version available is more intellectually honest (and historically valuable) than pretending that AVID decks, etc., were available all those decades ago.  It was a cheesy, exciting middlebrow action film: let's remember as it really was!",1180310400,4,2230,4.701799485861183
378212,5,6301773551,"Transport yourself back to 1977 when this film was first released.  I still remember the awe and incredible feeling when walking out of the theater after seeing Star Wars.  There had never truly been anything like it before.  Star Wars completely revolutionized cinematic films forever.  You could understand why suddenly hundreds and thousands of people all over the globe were standing in long lines waiting to get in to see this spectacular film.

Every once in a while, sometimes a long while, a movie comes along that completely changes how movies are done.  They are so different, because nobody has done anything like it before.  Star Wars is such a film.  Perhaps no other film in history has had as much impact on today's culture and society that Star Wars has.  It operates on physical, philosophical, mythological, and even spiritual levels.

""Jaws"" may have set the standard for the typical summer blockbuster, but Star Wars blew the doors off, and in many ways, raised the bar dramatically for all films that would ever follow in its footsteps.

Ironically, the story is a simple one, and George Lucas drew on many sources for his story that takes place in a galaxy far, far away.  He used old Saturday serials, Japanese samurai and mythology, as well as drawing a bit on King Arthur, and still others.  This helped to set up for one of the most incredible movies to ever grace the big screen.

Lucas was also smart in setting up a merchandising line of toys, t-shirts, lunchboxes, etc, and sat back and watched as the millions of dollars rolled on in.

The Empire Strikes Back is, in my opinion, the best Star Wars film of the six, but the original Star Wars is tough to beat.  How many kids dreamed of being taken away from their hum-drum life (like Luke on the farm) to suddenly find themselves immersed in a huge galactic adventure, complete with a beautiful princess to rescue, and being the hero who destroys the massive Death Star.

We saw things that weren't really popular until Star Wars revealed them.  We saw laser blasters being used, flying spaceships that engage in dogfights in outer space, strange and exotic creatures, and one of the ultimate items, the lightsaber.  Every kid loves sword-fighting, but to do it with a laser sword is the ultimate experience.

Take a good look at the top box office hits of all time.  9 of the top 10 movies are science fiction/fantasy films.  People love these kinds of stories.  They always have!  It doesn't matter if it's Lord of the Rings, the Lone Ranger, Spider-Man, Superman, or Star Wars.  We like be taken to a different world, a world of the fantastic.

I loved the original version of this film.  I didn't really see the need to change it.  Granted, there are some scenes in the newer version that work really well, but somehow, it doesn't bring back the nostalgic feelings like the original version does.  I like this DVD version because it gives me the option to watch either one.  There are times when I like to watch the updated version, and yet still, there are others when I feel like watching the original.  At least Lucas gives us a choice here.

It was one of the best ones of my childhood to watch with my father, who both him and my mother would tell me stories about watching the film at the drive-in back in 1977 and going ""Ohhh"" to seeing the stardestoryer on the screen for the first time.

378235,5,6301773551,"When I reached my 1,000th review on Amazon, I gave a lot of thought as to which item I wanted to be in that 1,000th spot. After all, I spent many years writing all of these reviews! Finally, I decided the spot should belong to Star Wars. This movie is one that literally affected the vocabulary of the world, and has become a cultural touchstone decades later. You can point out many books, movies, TV shows and even documentaries and news stories that refer to plot situations and characters from this very first Star Wars film.

I was a child when the first Star Wars came out, and I literally went to see the show over 10 times in the theater. It was that powerful for me. There was a princess who stood up for herself - who grabbed the gun and defended herself, who helped plan the escapes and attacks. But on the other hand this wasn't a war movie - there were characters who talked about how the universe was interconnected and how every person in it could make a difference. People of all shapes, sizes and colors were accepted here. There were infinite worlds and infinite options. I adored this movie.

While I appreciate the ""improvements"" made to this over the years, I really feel strongly that the original story was powerful because of the way it was written. It was the story that mattered - not high-flying special effects. I liked that Han shot first when he was in trouble. I liked that Mos Eisley was a desolate, quiet town - and that to Luke, this was a ""big city"". It really showed the relative value we all place on community. I think the *only* thing in the first movie that seemed a bit odd was when Han and Chewie were chasing after the stormtroopers on the Death Star - and fled because there were suddenly more than two. I do agree that that one change was probably necessary, but given that they were able to have ""lots of people"" (real or fake) in the final medal-presenting scene, I would have thought Lucas could have pulled that off here as well.

In any case, I think there is a huge value in seeing the actual movie, as it was released, without any trickery or post-movie additions. I also think, if you've somehow never seen this movie at all, that you should really watch it at least once. With all the many subtle references to this movie that pop up in our culture every day, it's good to have that grounding and be able to understand the references properly.",1178928000,6,2397,4.418552036199095

I couldn't have cared less about the new and improved most recent altered/special edition versions of the movies. In fact, once I got the original versions, I wanted to throw the special edition disks out, along with other special edition versions of the original trilogy I had accumulated over the years, but my wife wouldn't let me.

I all I can say, is after years of being force fed Lucas revisionist versions of the original trilogy, it was SOOOO refreshing to see unaltered versions.

Now, some of the ultra purists will insist these 'original' versions aren't the REAL originals, but a well done transfer from the laser disks done back in the late 80s or early 90s. I don't know if they are correct. I used to keep up with all this, but I stopped a while back. For those looking to relive the nostalgia of seeing the movies in theaters as kids, it probably won't matter much.  (Anyone who remembers the original Nub-Nub song from the end of Jedi and cried when Lucas replaced it with some new John Williams composition will know what I am talking about.)

In this classic release, Han shoots first! There are no Mos Eisley edits and the classic end battle is complete with original fighters and not those fake looking CGI spacecraft. I loved it all!

After seeing the originals, I realized just how cheezy the CGI additions in the special editions actually were. The original version even contained hairs and dust on the screen from the film capture, so the theater experience is even more authentic!

The original versions are works of art, in a way I feel I should frame them or put them in a safe deposit box. Lucas and company were miracle workers back then, true pioneers.

The special edition disk was pretty much the same as previous special editions, Lucas might have made some changes, who knows?

Not much.

This is quite possibly one of the most perfect films ever made. Since its initial release it has become a long-lasting international phenomenon and an American cultural icon. How many other films in history have kept such a large and faithful fan base 30 years after it was released?

This latest (and I'm POSITIVE it's not the last) release of this classic film is somewhat of a letdown. Many were outraged at the 1997 special edition and demanded the original theatrical release, but it looked as though that was not going to happen (yeah, right!). Finally, the original untouched version was given to us, but with no image upgrade or quality sound; plus, the image was letterboxed, not widescreen (BIG difference for those ""in the know"" and care about such things (like me)).

Fear not, true believers. In an attempt to bag another zillion, Lucas is sure to release yet another version of his beloved creation, only this time it will be in DTS and Dolby 5.1 as well as anamorphic widescreen.

You know it's going to happen. It's just a matter of time.

As for me, I REFUSE to purchase this title (I purchased the 2004 special editions because it was all I could get at the time). When Lucas finally comes to his senses and releases what I really want, I'll be happy to part with some of my money. Until that day, any other ""editions"" will be completely ignored by me.",1178150400,2,1444,4.577519379844961

378241,5,6301773551,"You had to be there to understand how profoundly different, how mesmerizing this film was when it was first released. As teenagers, my friends and I, living on the white trash side of town and with limited familial resources for much other than lunch money, had to shop lift our SF books. We stole them in great numbers, actually. I'm not proud of the fact, but our little SF club needed material to read and discuss, our basement library needed to grow, and our nascent writing talents needed role models. The genre was our life. Imagine the two remaining members of that thieving little club some years later, who, still addicted to SF, walked into the largest theater on the south side of Detroit, sat down without much of a clue what to expect, and watched that fantastic yellow roll-up against a field of real-looking stars, followed by that, that, that bone rattling sound and the sight of the very first Imperial cruiser rumbling overhead. My friend Mark actually had tears in his eyes at the close of the film. It was singularly fantastic. I'm feeling like the geeky kid I was then by reminiscing like this, but this film had a profound effect on me.

Mine is not the only generation in love with the series. My son, years later became a rabid Star Wars fan and amassed one of the largest collections of Star Wars stuff I've ever heard of, he even has some of the huge theater lobby cardboard stand-ups. I'm not sure where I'm going with this except to say that this film changed it all. It catapulted SF right out of the gutter and into the mainstream. It brought to cinematic life all the sights and sounds of distant worlds and characters that until then had existed only in our science fiction heads. It made at least one of us cry from the sheer joy of seeing it. It is a timeless wonder and real cinematic magic.",1177718400,3,1826,4.5
378242,3,6301773551,"It is certainly too bad that Lucas has decided to treat the 1977 version of Star Wars with such low regard, especially considering the fact that it was those of us that showed up to the theaters in droves to see this film thirty years ago that made his ""empire"" what it became. All I wanted was to see the exact scenes in the exact sequence that I saw them in back in 1977 with the same hokie sound effects, men running around in rubber costumes portraying all of the various creatures, and poorly rendered graphics. After all, that is all part of the nostalgia, and the nostalgia is all part of the fun. However, I did expect to see the film at least ""cleaned up"" from an audio and visual perspective, and that I did not get. As for the 2004 edition, that feature gets the royal treatment, but you have to put up with the infamous altering of Han's shootout with Greedo, as well as all of the added scenes, including digitally added dinosaur-like creatures that were considered state-of-the art when Jurassic Park came out 16 years after this movie was made. Neither makes for a satisfying film viewing experience for an oldster such as myself with a preconceived notion of what I want to see.

Apparently, the fact that these double-feature releases of the original Star Wars trilogy haven't sold well has us in a circular argument with its creator. You see, fewer people than expected have bought this set, since they are waiting for the 9-disc Ultimate Star Wars Saga to come out in a boxed set. However, Lucas is now determined to hold off putting out the trilogy boxed set for that very reason. Due to poor sales of this set he now intends to wait until 2008 or 2009 to release the long-awaited trilogy boxed set. The information in this last paragraph comes from the Feb. 23 post at The Rumor Mill of digitalbits, so it is still, after all, just a rumor. At any rate, something has to be done to stop Lucas from continuing to be the Darth Vader of digital editing. I really don't believe this business about Lucas' vision continuing to drive him to tinker - or not tinker - with these films. I think the original success of Star Wars surprised Lucas as much as anyone. After all, the original commercials for Star Wars back in 1977 said ""This summer see Star Wars ... just for the fun of it"".",1175472000,7,2299,4.460807600950119

Yet, for those of us old enough to remember the original, one very special scene from the original has been deleted, the meeting between Han Solo and Jabba the Hut in Mos Eisley, where Jabba is a human, (hence Han Solos comment as he boards the Falcon). It was this scene in particular which for me highlighted one of the huge changes between the original and the later version. So, come on George, why did you delete it? And why did you then have the audacity to market it as the 'original'?

Certainly, I must have a different version of the DVD to B. Abraham as he gives the distinct impression that this scene is in his version of the 'original'. Otherwise it is how I remembered. The one star is for the unacceptable deletion of the Jabba scene, which had it been left in would have been a great piece of nostalgia, and for film enthusiasts would have helped show how the franchise developed over the years.",1174867200,6,1101,4.477611940298507
378264,5,6301773551,"It has been a long time since I've seen the original Star Wars theatrical releases. The way they were ORIGINALLY. I loved it. For me, it's like watching a good Charlie Chaplin movie. You don't focus on the lack of special effects, sound or what they don't have. You let your imagination run wild and simply go along for the ride.

As Luke Skywalker begins his journey to self-discovery, I find myself walking it with him, unobstructed by 21st century special effects and additions that look grossly out of place in the updated version. The updated version has its place, but I much prefer the classic 1977 release.

378266,3,6301773551,"They say that many great works of fiction feature fictionalized versions of their creators. With that in mind, is it possible that the character in the ""Star Wars"" saga who most resembles George Lucas is none other than... Emperor Palpatine?

Think about it: Palpatine has managed to convince large numbers of people that he is a humble man whose actions are all for a higher cause, while in reality he is manipulating events in order to further his selfish ambitions. George Lucas claims that his constant tinkering with the ""Star Wars"" films is all an attempt to fulfill his ""original vision,"" although in reality it's all about lining his pockets with fans' hard-earned money.

Anyone who researches the development of ""Star Wars"" from the early to late 1970's will quickly realize that Lucas never had any ""master vision"" for the trilogy, despite what he likes to imply now. Several versions of the scripts were written, with numerous changes in plot, characters, etc. Lucas clearly had many IDEAS for his series, but so much constantly changed along the way that it's clear there was never, at any point, one ""official"" version of the series. Lucas is simply continuing his history of tinkering with the saga, and claiming that he's trying to ""restore"" some long-held vision is nonsense (one example: did the ""budget constraints"" on the original film, which he always cites, keep him from having Greedo fire first? What, he didn't have enough money to film a simple blast from Greedo's gun at the time?)

 Worse than altering the films that we know and love, however, is Lucas's drive to milk every last dollar out of hardcore fans. Lucas says that his decisions on the films are based solely on his ""vision,"" but notice how fast Jar Jar Binks's screentime plummeted in the prequel trilogy, once it became clear that fans despised the ill-conceived character. How much do you want to bet that if Binks had been a hit (i.e. sold tons of toys, the profits from which flow to Lucas), he would have dominated Episodes 2 and 3?

But most of the time, Lucas withholds things simply to sell them in repackaged form in the future. When the dvd set of the original trilogy came out, Lucasfilm crowed about the feature-length documentary included on a bonus disc, but I noticed the lack of deleted scenes right away. The only reason for this is that Lucas will release another set someday which includes the deleted scenes, and hardcore fans will feel compelled to buy the movies yet again. The ""withheld-bonus-to-be-offered-in-a-future-release"" trick is behind this current individual release of A NEW HOPE... if you want to own the beloved original 1977 theatrical release, you have to buy the Special Edition dvd (which you almost certainly already own) once more. And still no deleted scenes!

I've been a huge ""Star Wars"" fan since seeing the original film several times in 1977. Those early years of the original trilogy were magical, akin to the era of the Old Republic of ""Star Wars"" lore. But as time went on and the money poured in, it seems that George Lucas has crossed over to the dark side, to the point where he is now obsessed with the misguided notions of ""enhancing"" special effects and building his empire by selling the same movies over and over, turning the once-noble saga into a moneymaking machine.

All is not yet lost, however. Perhaps there's a chance that the ""Star Wars"" character who best represents Lucas isn't Palpatine, but instead, Darth Vader. I write this because, as Luke did with Vader, I sense that there is still good in George Lucas, and my hope is that if enough ""Star Wars"" fans feel the same, we will one day bring balance to The Force... and, like Vader, the machine that ""Star Wars"" has become will return to its basic humanity once more.",1173312000,21,3779,4.795698924731183

For example, why r2-d2 and c3po are always together, the nature of Darth Vader, why Obi-one Kenobi is Lukes jedi master and many many other questions that one had whilst watching this movie before. The special effects are a bit primitive but for the time they were outstanding and some of the best in the business. The music is right on the money.

378268,5,6301773551,"When I was a kid I went with my family to a small town where a new multi theater (at that time still in construction) opened with Star Wars. From that point it became my favorite movie. After a couple of years, for the Christmas / New Year / Three king's holidays they showed the movie on TV, so it was the next few years. However the TV versions, nowadays know as the original versions were slightly different from the movies I saw at the theater. So was the story from the comics we got back then. The edition on the theater was larger, though I cannot be precise on how much longer it was, I can remember scenes that I didn't seen on TV, like the one when Luke encounters Biggs before the final battle. Which didn't came back until the special edition, but it was on the original theatrical version I saw late '77 / early '78 (when it was show at San Juan del Rio, Qro. Mex.). Back then it make sense that to fit the movie + advertisement into 2 hrs. (later on 2,5 hrs as the TV people got greedier) time some cutting was necessary. But it was this new version that became something like the ""standard"" original version.

Also it was this version the one available for rent when so. Additionally there were some scenes larger that the ""standard original"" and I can only think, as this is not unique to this movie, that distribution of movies back on the `70s was not as organized as today's and some versions which where not the final cut got away to be on time ""somewhere"" I got the luck of seen a more complete, not as cut-off version back then. Adding this to the comic's version where even scenes like the one in which Han meets Java (still humanoid of course) made me had a wider sense of the story. So the special edition was not a surprise but another version. I wonder if there would be a time when a ""complete original version"", with all cut-off scenes included, ever will be available.",1171929600,4,1898,4.3165266106442575

378288,3,6301773551,"Whether or not the vitriol some reviewers have is justified, the specifications speak for themselves.  It states on the back of the case that on Disc 1 (the Special Edition version), the aspect ratio is 2.35:1, enhanced for 16:9 widescreen TVs, with English Dolby 5.1 Surround EX, along with various multilanguage Dolby 2.0 options.  On Disc 2 (the original theatrical version), the aspect ratio is 2.35:1 in 4:3 Letterbox format; the only sound options are in Dolby 2.0.  These stats alone indicate that the theatrical version is not presented with the same technological panache as the Special Edition.  Whether or not this is ""wrong"" is purely subjective.  However, there is no way a non-anamorphic, 4:3 letterboxed DVD can properly fill a widescreen TV without some sort of stretching, zooming, or cropping, all of which distort the original viewing image in some way.  On my 46"" Sony Bravia 1080p LCD set, connected via HDMI cable to my 720p/1080i upconverting DVD player, the only way to view the picture in its original aspect ratio is to have very thick black bands on all sides of the frame, making the viewing image absurdly small relative to the size of the screen.  Any other viewing option results in some loss of resolution, and often stretched and widened images.  And if you think I'm some kind of technical idiot, think again.  (Frankly, I'd be more worried about being labeled an idiot if I were not able to tell that a non-anamorphic DVD does not properly fill my widescreen monitor, then decided to post on Amazon.com, blathering about things I don't understand, and calling everybody else idiots.  But that's just me.)  Personally, I find the theatrical version to be fairly watchable, even when stretched to fill the screen, much the same way I find a good VHS tape on good equipment to be watchable; indeed, it is better than VHS, about on a par with Laserdisc, but it certainly presents a less state-of-the-art home theatrical experience than the lushly done-up Special Edition.  Beyond the technical specifications of the two discs, it is also clear that Lucas did not put as much care into the restoration of the theatrical version.  Dust spots are clearly visible in places, and colors are more muted and black levels less pronounced than in the Special Edition.  Sound is also an issue.  The stereo sound is decent, but again not up to the Special Edition's 5.1 mix. In addition to the lack of surround ""atmosphere,"" the LFE (Low Frequency Effect) is notably lacking in certain areas (e.g., when R2 thuds to the ground after being zapped by the Jawas).  While the theatrical version is not unwatchable on its own, it pales in comparison to the Special Edition's appearance and sound, and as such has somewhat of a ""historical"" feel about it, as though it were included for documentarian purposes, rather than as enjoyable home-theater fare.  I'm glad to have it in any format, but I personally would have been happier if Lucas had presented the three original theatrical versions on their own - rather than bundled with the Special Editions - properly restored, and presented in anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 surround mixes.  That's what these masterpieces deserve.

3 stars for the theatrical version, docked 2 stars from 5 due to technologically inferior presentation.  4.5 stars for the Special Edition, docked .5 stars from 5 only because I like the theatrical version better.

Is that too much to ask? Billion dollar LucasArts and Industrial Lights & Magic can't put be bothered to release product that is up to current standards? Once again, old man Lucas slaps his fan base in the face.

Quite frankly, with the release of the God-awful prequels, the ridiculously idiotic ""Special Editions"" (with the ""Fraggle Rock""- style Jabba's Palace musical number) of the original trilogy, and countless other insults to my intelligence, anything I ever loved about Star Wars has been soiled.

I like to watch movies, I enjoy the cinematic art, but all this baggage required to enjoy Star Wars these days is too much effort for too little reward. It feels more like I'm watching a video game than a film. Let the mindless geeks that bow to Lucas' every whim open their wallets and throw their hard earned geek money down. But I doubt the general population are going to care much longer. Their numbers have to be dwindling, and eventually their numbers will be so low that perhaps Lucas will see the error of his ways and treat the original films with some shred of respect. You can't go back, George. It was 1977. What's done is done. Be proud of your accomplishments. They were 3 good films. They stood the test of time.

But now they are gone. You can have `em, for a couple of months, but you can't watch them with your HD televisions. You want 1977, then you watch it with 1977 equipment, right George? What a sick maniac he is. Evil is the only word that sums him up.

All Lucas' tinkering has made a mess of things. Hey, I'm all for cleaning up the picture and maybe making certain special effects look a little nicer (Landspeeder pink glow? Transparent Snow Speeders? I got no problem with him touching those up). But I find alterations that greatly change the flow of the film (or, in the case of the CGI Jabba in A New Hope and the ghastly new Jabba Palace song, brings the films to a screeching halt). It's impossible to watch the films without being annoyed. Heck, I can't even enjoy the sinister ""Darth Vader"" since I know there's a sniveling little twerp inside the costume.

Yep, the world of Star Wars is forever ruined, and I couldn't care less if I ever see any of the films again as long as I live. I felt tempted to buy this set just out of desperation, but I have to take a stand. We are the enablers who give him the money and power to do these things. We are the ones who can send a message, even if that message will be misinterpreted or fall on deaf ears.

378317,5,6301773551,"I certainly understand everyone's anger over the ""double dipping"" going on throughout the DVD industry.  I also understand that George Lucas is one of the biggest culprits in this area (dating back to the video tape releases of his properties.)  I predicted this release because, if nothing else, Lucas is a shrewd businessman.  After guaranteeing sales of the Special Editions (by declaring that they would be the only versions of the saga ever released), he then released the original version so that the purists would wind up owning both incarnations.  The move may have been artistic: the Special Editions do flow better with the prequels.  It may have been about the money- there was a lot to be made there.  It may be that he really never wanted to release the originals but felt pressure from the fan base.  I'm not here to attack him or defend him regarding this issue.  The point, metaphorically, is:  if I want to play, I have to face the fact that George Lucas owns the playground.

I was eight-years-old when Star Wars was released in 1977.  I couldn't wait to see that film.  Unfortunately, I had to...my parents refused to take me because they were not interested.  I finally wore them down by the summer of 1978 when they begrudgingly took me to a Drive-In to see it.  By then it had the ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" tacked on and, even though I loved it, I felt I missed out.  In viewing the film for the first time in it's pure form, I realized how good it really was.  I'm not going to go in to all the fan boy rhetoric that permeates most reviews.  I'm simply going to state that the original Star Wars, like it or hate it, is a piece of cinema history.  It changed the way Science Fiction movies and, for that matter, movies in general, were perceived.  It's raw and rough around the edges and that is part of its charm. I am constantly amazed by CGI and what can be portrayed on film.  I am amazed but not engrossed or moved.  I prefer the film in this raw form with none of the upgrades that are available to DVD releases- after all I wanted to see the movie that I missed in the theater! This film and its two sequels (in their original form) are what escapism and imagination are all about.  It's hard to believe but there was a time (not too long ago) when heroes weren't ""anti-heroes"" and hope wasn't considered nave.  Good films have something to say about the human condition and this film is no exception.  Unfortunately, since its original release people have forgotten that it is a film about life and not a way of life.  If you understand what I'm trying to say, you've probably already purchased this DVD.  If not, I suggest you give it a try- but do so with the mind-set of a wide-eyed eight-year-old.",1166572800,11,2731,4.44466800804829
378318,3,6301773551,"I first saw Star Wars on HBO when I was 5 years old.  I then bought it on VHS, and rented the DVD's when they came out.  The first couple of times I saw the movie, I was amazed and astounded each time.  But after watching the updated version at the theaters and now on DVD, the movie has lost some of its magic and shine.  Here is why.

First, of all the re-releases, Lucas tweaked A New Hope the most.  Some scenes were added that should have been left out.  The scene with Jabba in the hangar on Tatooine is a good case in point.  Jappa looks way too small, and not quite as brown as he looks in Return of the Jedi.  Also, one of the great things about the original trilogy is the fact that each character has minimal introduction before they appear on screen.  We expected Yoda to be a tall and majestic warrior when Obi-Wan first tells Luke about it, not a midget with long ears.  Likewise, Jabba and his court made a great introduction for Return of the Jedi.  Now that is all spoiled by his appearance in A New Hope.

Second, the special effects of the original A New Hope actually was the most realistic.  They were subtle and helped the movie, but did not carry it.  The special effects of the revised version looked a little too shiny in some places, and somewhat detracts from the supposed ""feel"" of the Star Wars world; used and rusty.

Third, there were some parts of the movie that could have been expanded on to make the storyline more believable, but were not.  My example of this is at the end when the X-wing fighters take on the Death Star.  A space station of that size would surely have hundreds of tie fighters that it could launch into space.  The movie shows about two dozen.  One of the attractions of this movie when it first came out was the space shoot-out scenes, and the last one in this movie could have been greatly improved upon.  Also, why didn't the X-wings try attacking the big planet-destroying gun on the Death Star.  It was clearly visible as a big dish on the surface of the Death Star, and the strafing runs by the X-wings proved the Death Star did not have any energy shielding device.  Why not damage the gun first to buy them some time, and then try and destroy the battle station.

Last, with the release of Episodes I, II, and III, Lucas should have used the opportunity to make the storylines of all six movies flow together better.  Specifically, why does Vader sense the force in Luke but not in Leia, especially given the fact that he is in closer proximity to Leia than to Luke.  Or does Vader's force sense become stronger in battle?  Not sure, but would have liked to know.

Overall, this re-release was not worth it for me.  Stuff was added that should not have been, and stuff that should have been added were not.  If you've already bought one copy of A New Hope, I would not bother with this one.  If not, then this would be a good buy.",1165708800,4,2893,4.301851851851852

I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character ""Biggs"" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length.

Sure we all want the choice between the original Star Wars and the Special Edition, but I think George is doing nothing but slapping us fans in the face with this release. I despertly wanted the original movies in their original form, but not like this.  I think George is basically trying to get us to admit that his special edition is better....it's not.

Change the songs to something more ""current""?  Digitally enhance Atlanta burning? No....but they did do those transfer justice.  They look great, they sound great, and that makes for fun viewing.

378372,3,6301773551,"I am one of those geeks who was ten years old when Star Wars came out (note: it was not originally called ""Episode IV."") I watched it in the theater perhaps a dozen times. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.

This release contains two DVDs: the version that Lucas has been tinkering with, and on a bonus disc, the original movie in 4:3 letterbox, taken from the best-available videodisc masters.

About that ""tinkering."" The 2004 version of Episode 4 looks, for the most part, quite gorgeous. The _restoration_ that Lucasfilm did is impressive: the blacks are blacker, the whites whiter, the color richer, the contrast improved all around, and the soundtrack is great. The dirt and scratches are gone, the shaky color very solid.

However, at some point Lucas crossed over from ""restoration"" into making a new movie. That's fine; he has the right to do so. But for him to say that the original Star Wars is not really what he had in mind, when it was one of the most famous and popular movies in history and became entrenched in the culture -- well, I find that weirdly arrogant. And when he says, in effect, that his altered version _is_ ""Star Wars"" and the original _isn't_ -- well, hmmm. A movie is a historical artifact. There's a difference between preservation and tinkering. Mainly, that tinkering mostly is there to gratify the artist, while preservation serves the art -- and the fans of the art. Artistic creation is a fragile and uncertain process. For Lucas to assume that he knew exactly what made Star Wars great and presume to make it better misstates the amount of control that artists actually have over how their creations are received by the public.

Where you draw this line is slightly unclear. I think the cleanup of the backgrounds is fine. The improvement of the soundtrack to use the latest technology available is wonderful. I'm not sure why Kenobi's weird cry that drives away the sandpeople was replaced with a slightly different weird cry. He's redone some of the explosions twice now. I'm not sure why they all became pink in 2004. Why did he feel that Alderaan and the Death Star needed to explode in giant rings? Why do the lightsabers now give off blinding green flashes when they collide? Most of these changes are not improvements; they are just distractions. They tend to stick out like a sore thumb to fans who have seen the movie many times.

But there are more than just the small arbitrary changes, I'm not really happy with the addition of dinosaur-like creatures in Mos Eisley, and I'm really not happy with giving these little bits and pieces cartoonish _sound_ that sounds like it came from Episode 1. Star Wars, the original, had a different tone, a different mood, than Empire and Jedi and the whole prequel trilogy. It's a little darker. It's a world where rebels and stormtroopers are violently killed and Han Solo shoots first. Lucas is free to make that world happier and more cartoonish in his later films, but altering, and in some cases censoring violence from the original, is a very strange thing to do.

So, although I really admire the improvements to the image and sound in the 2004 edition, I generally prefer watching the original 1977 cut. For that, I'm sorry to report that the digital transfer, from the videodisc master, is only adequate. Many fans are griping that it is 4:3 instead of anamorphic 19:9. This means it isn't full-width on a widescreen TV. That doesn't particularly bother me, but I'm viewing it on an old TV, not a widescreen TV. It looks like a very good analog videotape, but we've recently -- and rather abruptly, in terms of years -- gotten used to DVDs of films that were transferred to the digital realm and mastered there. It's actually taken from the master for the analog videodisc. The audio is good, but again we now tend to compare it to all-digital productions. Negative comments on Amazon about the black level are on the mark; some of the space scenes make black outer space look brown, or gray. This is particularly evident when we see Vader's helmet in his tie fighter; his helmet is blacker than the black background of space. But that is true in the original film; it was noticeable in the theater on opening day. A number of the desert scenes have poor contrast and faded color; some of this is film deterioration, and some is because the contrast and color in some of the outdoor Tatooine scenes were never that good to begin with. There are noticeable scratches. The color is shaky in some scenes, particularly outdoor scenes, and flickers a bit. It looks like a film that is considerably older than it is. I've seen restored films from considerably earlier that look a lot better than this one does.

Here's the thing: it didn't have to be this way. We would have considered it to be a fairly good video rendering at one point in time. But our expectations have been raised considerably -- and, in fact, Lucas himself is largely responsible for raising those expectations, because of his constant embrace of new technology for delivering films to audiences. The 2004 DVD release has all those black level problems fixed. There aren't any visible scratches. The contrast is excellent. The colors are vivid. The missing dialog is restored.

So which version do I want to watch? Well, the answer is neither. I want to watch a version that doesn't exist: call it ""Star Wars: the Nostalgia Edition."" That version would be fully _restored_, but not _altered_. And it would have things like Han Solo's scene with Jabba available as a ""deleted scene"" special feature, along with all the other so-called lost footage such as the scene at Anchorhead, which introduces (and makes sense of) Luke's relationship with Biggs. It would have been presented with respect for the original work, not as a bonus disc given no special treatment. Instead, Lucas has disowned that picture.

And here's the thing: I'd be shocked if Lucas didn't have every scene, unaltered, from the first film in beautifully restored digital form. After all, wouldn't a restored original film have been the starting point for this whole process of remastering that led to the 1997 and 2004 versions?

So, I'm not actually advocating that we give up the advances in restoration that are evident in the 2004 release. But don't bother with the tinkering. The fans don't care about it. Keep the original death star cell block footage. Sure, the tunnel behind the actors is obviously a matte painting, and the perspective is off kilter when the camera angle changes. But you know what? I saw Star Wars at least ten times in the theater and I never noticed the problem -- because it isn't a ""problem,"" it's an artifact of the budget and technology that existed in 1977. You notice it if you are looking at the frame cynically, not when you are immersed in the story. It might be an irritant to Lucas now, but it is the effect we grew up with. For the ""Nostalgia Edition,"" let Star Wars be Star Wars.

Then Lucas can go on with his director's cuts, turning Star Wars into a 3-D cartoon until the sun explodes, for all I care. Just don't make me watch Greedo shoot first!",1162857600,"1,407",7136,4.6916932907348246
378373,5,6301773551,"Star Wars Empowers Women

  The civil rights movement in 1960s America gave new voices to unheard minorities, and the 1970s looked like it would be a decade that ushered in new equality for women too.  The ERA was a hot topic, and the second half of the decade featured a strong leading lady in one of the most popular movies of all time.  The movie was Star Wars, and the leading lady was Princess Leia.

  Princess Leia was symbolic of the new feelings of empowerment many women were starting to realize.  The movie begins with Leia being questioned by the threatening Lord Vader, but she does not shrink back in fear as actresses in old-time movies did.  She stands her ground instead.  She famously uttered the line, ""I thought I recognized your foul stench"" to the most powerful men in the movie.

  And when in the presence of good guys (Luke and Han) she boldy takes charge, blasting a hole in the walls of the detention center so that they could escape the imperial troopers.  Not only was she strong-willed, she was also portrayed to be strong-minded, instantly recognizing that Han's Falcon escaped from the Death Star only because they were allowed to.  While Han denied it was possible, Leia knew that the empire was tracking them back to the rebel base.

  I give Star Wars 5 stars because I'm always finding more things I like about it the more I watch it.  So much happens in such a short amount of movie-time, and the strong role Leia played is an excellent example of contemporary cultural values influencing dramatic cinematography.

""Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope"" is, without a doubt, one of the greatest science-fiction films of our time. It's combination of great performances, awesome visual effects, fantastic action sequences, and stirring music combined to create a tour-de-force of the sci-fi genre. George Lucas succeeded in creating a science fiction film that's not only believable, but full of emotion as well. You care for the characters, and are not just enthralled with the specatcular space battles. This is the heart of ""Star Wars,"" and what makes it a milestone in the pantheon of American film!

THE SPECIAL EDITION

Unlike most others, I really enjoyed the Special Edition of ""Star Wars."" With the new digital technology, we got to see the full realization of Lucas' vision. Mos Eisley is now a bustling spaceport; the explosions are even more impressive than before; and the final battle at the end is truly spectacular. What's most fascinating of all is how the new visual effects from 1997 blend well with the older effects from 1977. Lucas only fixed what needed to be fixed, and it makes the experience more exciting than ever before.

THE LIMITED EDITION DVD

When I heard the rumor that Lucas intended to release the 1977 Theatrical Version of the film, I decided to wait before purchasing the films. And the wait was definitely worth it! Both versions of the film are presented with fantastic sound and picture quality. And while the extras are light, just the fact that both versions of the film are available makes it more than worth it.

CONCLUSION

The Limited Edition 2-Disc Set of ""Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope"" is a fantastic release for one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Even if you own the 4-Disc boxed-set, the fact that the original version of the film is available makes it worth buying this edition as well. As a ""Star Wars"" fan, I highly recommend it!

It's time for Star Wars and Star Trek to give it a rest and let newer Sci-Fi like Dune, Firefly, Battle Star Galactica and stuff like that take its place.

I can honestly say that I will not ever purchase the Star Wars saga again, not even when HD-DVD wins the HD wars and it is released there.",1160697600,6,478,4.074468085106383
378413,4,6301773551,"After reading the reviews, I was a bit sketchy about the fact that the original versions were simply going to be the 1994 Laserdisc masters - and yes there are a couple of problems to watch out for. 1) In really bright moments these versions 'clip' - which in the visual digital realm means the screen goes white for a split second - not ideal and a bit wearing on the eye. 2) The sound is a bit funny in bits - especially in Star Wars. Empire and ROTJ are a bit better but there is some sort of echoey slapback that occurs sometimes and the compression drags some stuff up to the front of the mix that really shouldn't be there.

Apart from that, the films look and sound great.

All that said - it is awesome to finally have the original, untarnished versions on DVD and now that I have them (I was given them as a gift) I am very pleased indeed.",1160611200,4,848,4.133333333333334

The picture quality is just fine on the original 1977 version and if you get the widescreen version, you get the widescren version.  My only complaint is that there are really no extras to really make this special.  All three movies have a demo for Lego Star Wars II and it's only for the XBox.  So, yeah: Both movies, nothing special... other than the fact you get the unalterd originals that we all loved when we were younger.",1160524800,5,478,4.459770114942529

But like the title says, Amazon reviews are fairly reliable, because they're written by people like me, who generally care about products like this one.

I sure hope someone from Lucasfilm is reading these reviews. Let me summarize: if you release the theatrical original movies on DVD for really reals, people will buy. If you try to slide something half-arsed by us, one or two people will buy, then they'll write reviews on Amazon.com, and then nobody will buy.

I'm gonna buy Lego Star Wars instead.",1160352000,5,746,4.636363636363637
378416,4,6301773551,"What George Lucas doesn't seem to understand, and what no one has apparently succeeded in conveying to him thus far, is that he didn't just make a movie here.  What he did, instead, was to give an American people who were trying to figure out who they were (at the end of the counterculture revolution) a new mythology to latch onto.

The summer of love was almost a decade behind us.  Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison were all dead.  Peace, love and music had given way to cocaine and disco, and a new generation of kids was looking for a new purpose.

""Star Wars - A New Hope"" made it cool for boys to want to be warriors again, just a few years after Vietnam ended in fiasco.  It also electrified millions of young people (myself included) to the possibilities that might exist beyond earth orbit, and beyond the technology of 1977.

Finally, it touched on that most powerful human need - to be a part of a story with real meaning and spellbinding adventure.  For the generation born in the late 60's that was too young to have been a part of the counterculture revolution, ""Star Wars"" was our Homer's Odyssey.  It was the tale that defined our culture and our generation.  It was our definitive mythology.

Nobody wants their definitive mythology messed with, even if the result is a better film.

Message to George Lucas:  Please fully restore the original theatrical versions and issue them in anamorphic widescreen the way they deserve.  Nobody asked you to change our world, but you did, and became a millionaire in the process.  You started this, now please finish it by giving us properly restored DVD documents of the original versions of the three movies that changed my generation of Americans forever.",1160352000,5,1726,4.66887417218543

From what I read, poor picture quality aside (I can live with lack of Widescreen etc), this is NOT the version I saw in '77 and that is what I was waiting for.

The '77 movie is what was magic for us, dumbinb things down like having Hans shoot second is damaging to the film. Hans was not a villain, but he was a smuggler (illegal - regardless of the despotic regime, he wasn't smuggling literature or food...) among other things. However, when he fired on Gweedo (eeep what a name... ;) ) it could be argued he was firing in self defense. Gweedo was not there to exchange Wookie-grooming tips.

And that is what I liked, we were shown something more 'real seeming' than what we may have expected. The story was good (not great) but the package deal was great and it's place in time and history shall always be secured. Why change that movie and call it the 'original'?

Don't get me wrong - I was excited to buy BOTH original and reedited versions for only $20 to enjoy both...but not like this. I will pass.",1160352000,3,1097,4.285024154589372
378418,5,6301773551,"This is a perfect release for someone like me--I saw the films in my teens and never paid the slightest bit of attention to them thereafter.  I haven't ever bought a tape or dvd of any of the Star Wars stuff, but was intrigued by the idea of finally being able to see the orginals.  The theatrical release on the bonus disc is not in great shape, but I don't mind an old movie looking old--also the other 2 don't look nearly this bad.  I have a 26 -inch LCD:  it looks fine if I leave it with bars on all four sides, and loses a lot when I zoom in.  I've noticed though, that if you watch it in a dark room at night, it looks a lot better than in daylight.

I really enjoyed the commentary on the 2004 SE disc.  Carrie had the most interesting things to say, and I was amazed at how much thought and effort the sound guy and the other one put into their work.  Lucas was o.k.

Bottom line:  If you bought the SE in 2004 and only want the theatrical if it looks great--don't buy this.  Perhaps everything in the commentaries is well-known, too, to the real fans.

But if this is the first and last Star Wars purchase that you intend to make--then go for it.  I loved seeing the orginal film (and sorry George, but I don't think it would have been half as good without the John Williams score), and I enjoyed the commentaries quite a bit.  There's no denying that these films are part of the cultural history of our times, and they deserve room on your dvd shelf for that reason alone.",1160265600,4,1483,4.13986013986014
378419,3,6301773551,"""Star Wars"" is a classic, and while it's nice to finally have a theatrical version on DVD, this release seems more like a slap in the face to diehard fans than a worthy treatment.

Those who have the 2004 DVD release of ""Star Wars,"" already own half of this release. The first disc is the beautifully restored but altered ""Super-Special Edition"" of the film. Picture quality is great and it's enhanced for widescreen TVs, but Han does not shoot first, and there are bits of needless CGI inserted here and there. Also, the color balance is odd and the restoration left strange color patterns in the background of some scenes. For those who don't have the film memorized, this will probably suffice. But the diehards who wore out their VHS copies are sad to see unneccesary if small alterations made to the film.

For such fans, the ""bonus disc"" is the best part of this set. It is a transfer of the original theatrical version of the film. The disappointing part? The image quality isn't wonderful and the movie has been matted for a standard TV. This makes watching the movie on a widescreen frustrating to say the least.

Lucas says this is your last chance to own the unedited originals, but he said that ten years ago before the ""Special Editions"" were released. I hope these films someday recieve a high quality release in their unaltered forms. The films deserve it and the fans deserve it.",1160006400,7,1395,4.6396761133603235

I even wrote a review on amazon in which I suggested that both editions should be made available to the public. I never expected them to be in the same package, but that is a nice little bonus and I'm grateful.

People here seem to complain alot about release after release of these movies, as well as a lack of Dolby digital 5.1 and no anamorphic wide screen on the originals themselves. Right now I really don't mind because:

1. I waited for something like this to happen, so I am buying the movies on DVD for the first time. Since I already had the older Special Editions on VHS this wait was rather easy.

2. I have not invested in a fancy home theatre set up, I just have the stereo speakers on my TV. (Home theatre set ups keep improving and dropping in price, so I may buy one some day. But I keep finding so many other things I'd rather spend my money on that I haven't gone beyond the basics.)

3. I have no interest in spending thousands of dollars, even hundreds, on a HDTV at this time. So my standard TV does just fine and the anamorphic feature would be wasted on it. (Yes, I know that standard signals are going to be cut off 12/31/09, but I'll do fine without them. Who knows, I might even read a few more books next year instead.)

If I ever get a fancy home set up (highly doubtful), then I may miss all of these features. But until then I am very grateful for a chance to relive some childhood memories.",1159833600,6,1618,4.156549520766773

Disc 1, ****

Clean transfer, great sound.

Disc 2, ***

Old transfer; probably from laserdisc. Dirt and grain pronounced at times, but not overly distracting; the story still pulls you in. Imperfect effects shots are endearing, fond reminders of multiple viewings in the theater. Sound is good, ships traveling nicely back to front.

Most important, however, is that the feature presentation on Disc 2 is the original-original STAR WARS. The opening text crawl is NOT prefaced with ""Episode IV: A New Hope"".

Yes, this reviewer would have appreciated remastered picture and sound from the original source (otherwise unaltered; perhaps for a boxed set once the high-def wars are settled), but the original feature on this two-disc set accurately presents the film as it was seen in theaters in 1977.",1159747200,4,820,5.174242424242424
378474,5,6301773551,"I've got my share of problems with George Lucas - all the usual ones. I absolutely love the original three movies. I love the story, the effects, the way the movies take me back to my childhood - above all, the original trilogy was extremely fun. I've never seen the prequels, and I never will. When I thought the updated dvd versions of the originals were all we'd ever get, I bought them, and I regretted it. I hated the CGI (above all I couldn't stand the added scene with Jabba; and the desert sequence in Return of the Jedi looks more like a video game than a movie) because they were distracting and very fake looking. Star Wars didn't look like Star Wars anymore.

Because I don't have a special wide-screen tv, and I have no real need for all the bells and whistles of super-duper surround sound, I decided to go ahead and buy these new releases with the original movies. What a wonderful relief it was to see the movies I loved again.

The oddest thing for me was how much more realistic the then-ground-breaking, now ""primitive"" special effects look than the CGI. They fit the tone of the movie better, especially the explosion of the Death Star, and all around take me back to when Star Wars was the greatest thing in the world. Instead of saying ""look how fake that CGI looks,"" I'm back to saying ""isn't it incredible what Lucas was able to do in 1977!""

If you like the prequels, the newer versions are probably great for you. The six movies fit together, the new Anakin shows up in Jedi, and I suppose that continuity is nice to have. I therefore don't mind that the updated versions exist. They're just not for me. I wouldn't colorize Casablanca, and I wouldn't CGI Star Wars.

Whether Lucas caved to fan pressure, responding to a demand, or he's just out for more money, I wouldn't speculate. The result is the same: We've got our Star Wars back. And I, for one, am glad to have it.",1159488000,15,1898,4.414285714285715

5 - Original Versions

1 - Picture quality

I can just imagine Mr. Lucas wringing his hands saying, ""How dare they not like my 'special editions'! So, they'd prefer the original releases? Well, I'll give them the original releases! Complete without any digital enhancement of picture quality whatsoever! Ha ha ha ha!""

They have to have the worst picture quality of any DVD I own. Shame on you George! Still, Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back are still better with the poor quality picture than with the altered scenes.

I didn't mind the scenes that are improved, such as redoing the special effects for the ships without really changing what happened. What I find unbearable to watch are scenes that change the action are not even as well done as the original.

1. Greedo scene. The new version robs Han of his cleverness as well as his edge, and reduces it to nothin more than luck (and altered poorly to boot. Incredibly fake looking encounter in ""special"" edition).

2. Wampa (ESB). Seeing the creature more vividly robs the scene of suspense and fear. (Not too mention the terrible altered sound effects)

3. Vader speaks with the Emperor (ESB). The movie begins with Vader obsessed with finding ""Skywalker"", but then needs the Emperor to tell him that Luke's his son? Please don't alter scene to try to fit the infereor prequal trilogy.",1159315200,11,1378,4.760504201680672

There are so many words that can be used to decribe ""Star Wars"" - classic, astounding, remarkable, wonderful, awe-inspiring, ground-breaking, all these words do not even begin to sum up my love for ""Star Wars."" I have had the immense honor of seeing the original trilogy not only in theatres (albeit the ""special editons,"" but the Death Star battle looks amazing in a movie theatre!) but countless times on video as well. This movie pretty much ties with ""The Wizard Of Oz"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"" as the movies I have seen WAY more times than any others. This DVD release is particularly exciting, seeing as it contains the original version that I first saw as a kid. When the specifications of the disc were announced I was admittedly dissappointed, but they were not enough to stop me from buying them. Being skeptical due to the lack of anamorphic enhancement, I went in expecting the worst. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. The transfer was very pleasing, and all the feelings of nostalgia came roaring back. This is the ""Star Wars"" I remember, and I will never have to watch the ""Special Editions"" again. Now, having purchased the 2004 trilogy release, I simply replaced those discs with the new release, but decided to keep the nice trilogy box as well as the outstanding bonus disc. All in all, I am really happy with my purchase, and I do recommend this DVD.

Video: As everyone knows, the ""Special Edition"" looks great. But I seriously doubt anyone is buying this for the ""Special Edition,"" so lets see how the original version looks. The disc is presented in 2.35:1 non-anamorphic widescreen. Upon watching the movie, I was really impressed with this transfer. Having all my old VHS tapes as well as the laserdisc version to draw back on, the DVD is lightyears beyond the VHS and laserdiscs. On my standard definition TV, the movie looked great (The TV has a 16:9 feature and can rival the best widescreen and LCD TV sets). I put this disc through the wringer by watching bits and pieces on my high resolution computer. Even with the increased resolution, the disc still looked very good. While anamophic enhancement would have been nice, there are no complanits here. This is far better than what I was expecting. (4/5)

Audio: This is definately one of the best Dolby 2.0 tracks I've ever heard. In Pro-Logic II, this track can rival Dolby 5.1, and in some ways is better than the 5.1 EX mix found on the ""Special Edition."" One scene where the audio is defiantely better is the scene between Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia, where the Death Star destroys Alderaan. On the ""Special Editon,"" the dialogue varied in pitch, and got quite distracting. Here, the dialogue remains the same pitch throughout the scene. The attack on the Death Star is where the track really shines. Overall, very impressive for a 2.0 mix. (4/5)

Extras: On disc one, there is the commentary that first appeared on the 2004 release. Its still a good commentary, but nothing new. On disc two which containsa the original version, there is a trailer for the ""Star Wars Lego Game,"" as well as a game demo. Not terribly interesting. (2/5)

Overall: Many have complained about this release, but I have really nothing negative to say. It was better than I expected, and I am sure glad I purchased this DVD. Recommended! (4/5) The five star review rating is for the movie.",1159228800,14,3387,4.716216216216216

Watching the new DVD is to step back into an age of low resolution standards conversions with all the loss of detail and motion blurring that that entailed: certainly if you've got one of the old remastered video releases you might as well hold on to that, because the quality isn't as poor as this. The sound quality is pretty awful as well. From Lucas' past track record it's all too easy to imagine this is just a scam to allow him to sell a remastered version a couple of years down the line, but it's even harder to dispel the notion that somewhere Lucas is whining ""See how soft the focus is? How can you say these are better films?""

Although commonly blamed for the death of cinema as we knew it, in truth Star Wars was a huge breath of fresh air after the increasingly stale and formulaic week-in, week-out reality of woefully unimaginative and derivative downbeat on-the-cheap 70s cinema. It wasn't merely a matter of having a happy ending, more that there was a sense of panache and unapologetic adventure that had been missing for too long at the time (even the decade's best adventures, such as The Wind and the Lion and The Man Who Would Be King, saw their heroes destroyed by society in an age that had no place for them). Looking at it for the first time in years, its much better directed than remembered, extremely well constructed and beautifully designed, introducing the `future is old' concept that many would attribute to Ridley Scott. It also, unlike the prequels, has the saving grace of Han Solo, a character whose deprecating sense of humor undercuts the more solemn and potentially pretentious moments in a way that would be much missed amid the talk of apprentices, trade embargoes and midi-chloridians in the prequels. It's still fun and it still works, even in the very worst transfer of the originals.",1159142400,9,2139,4.628947368421053

The colours and tones of the picture are far better than the 2004 versions (not as lurid or likely to give the viewer eyestrain) and the Dolby 2 Surround sounds just as good as 5.1 to me. Spaceships still fly over my head and the sound fills the living room.

Honestly, I'm more than happy with these as my copies of the original theatrical versions. I've been though several of copies of bootlegs of these films (including an anamorphic version from the 1993 laserdiscs) and none of them has been a patch on the quaility of these official versions.

If you are wondering about purchasing this release and are worried about th image/sound quality, I wouldn't be. It's as good as any other dvd release - only the film itself is much better!! I'm an out and out Star Wars geek, and I'm more than satisfied with this!! I'm off to get the other two movies now I know how good the quality is.

Thanks to Lucasfilm for listening to the fans and releasing these versions. I'll stop complaining now!!",1158969600,6,1556,4.464788732394366

Had not watched the original version since the special editions came out in early 1997.

I was really looking forward to the commentary package with the 2004 version.  But, George, this should have been better.  Only 4 people were available?  George, Carrie, Ben Burtt & Dennis Muren?  That was it?  Harrison I know he most likely would not be interested, but where is Mark?  Was he too busy?  Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, anyone else?  No John Williams?

Then, the 4 people were NOT together so comments were done by themselves just talking, no reactions or stories of filming shared between the people who actually were used here.

And, oh George, you should be ashamed.  A promise of ""DVD-Rom weblink to exclusive Star Wars content"".  Oh really?  Let's see, you need to download something to view this & THEN THE DOWNLOAD DOES NOT WORK.  I am SO DISAPPOINTED in this.  I think George hang your head in shame.  For a person who has done so much with the companies you have started to help out with film effects, etc, this HAVING TO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER TO WATCH THIS WHEN THE DVD PACKAGE SAYS NOTHING OF THIS SPECIAL FEATURE/DOWNLOAD BEING NEEDED.  Horrible, horrible, DOES NOT work.

But, keep in mind he has released the first 3 films 3 times on DVD in 2 years.  There will MORE editions in future years so we will all have to wait to see what he will add to the next DVD package.

It seems like people want Lucas to cater to their individual needs.  ""I want the original version, but with the following improvements/enhancements...""  To me, that defeats the purpose.

What really annoys me is that people complained with Lucas not releasing the original versions of Ep. IV, V and VI. They complained endlessly on how he changed the sound, the special effects, etc. The only gripe I had was with switching Greedo shooting first instead of Han, but even THAT was minor and DIDN'T detract from the overall story for me.

Now, Lucas releases the original stories. And what do the ""purists"" have to say? ""WHY NOT IN DOLBY DIGITAL/THX 5.1??? That's all we asked for!"" No, you asked for them untouched, unedited and that's what you got. The ""purists"" all stated they wanted the originals with the blemishes that were in them because that's what made the movies so special. Yet, they complain that he didn't digitally enhance the pictures to make it clearer, etc. Which do you want? Don't touch the picture (as many have stated that they want it blemishes and all) or do you want him to fix it? He already has - that's what the 2004 release on DVD was. Man, you just can't please anyone these days can you?

For me, the 1977/1980/1983 versions look great considering the source - the original laser disc versions. The sound is NOT horrid, even though it's in 2.0. It's wonderful to see the movie in it's untouched glory, even though I enjoy the newer versions as well.

I say, if you held off and didn't buy the 2004 release, here is your chance to get both versions. There is NOTHING wrong with owning both. The only thing you miss out on is the extra DVD that came with the 2004 boxed edition that contains a wealth of extra features on how the original trilogy was created.

If you did buy the 2004 release and don't really care about the original versions of Star Wars, then this release is probably not for you. However, if you DO want the original versions in their untouched glory, here you go!",1158969600,8,1970,4.461111111111111

Yes, the updated versions are more in line with what he wanted, but you know what, when I saw them in the theater, they didn't have the extras and I still made sure I owned them on VHS.  I'm sure George didn't release them because he needs the money, but because there are a bunch of anal purist fans like myself out there that wanted our Star Wars movies back, unmolested.

I have purchased a few versions. I believe in keeping things intact but I am also open to changes. I am one of the few (if any) that likes both presentaions of this film series. I own the THX widescreen VHS trilogy because I thought it would be the best available. I also own the silver 2004 box set. Like many I was curious about this release.

Now, opinions are like...stars. Many, many out there. The theatrical versions of these DVD's are fine. There are certain imperfections but they're not that obvious. The picture is clear and rather crisp for an ""untouched"" print. The 2004 LucasVision prints are beautiful of course. If you're debating...if you like your THX widescreen tapes...I WOULD recommend buying this. VCR's can't protect your tapes forever. These are worth the money and they are enjoyable. The sound is decent as well. I have good but ""square"" televisions. I'm sure if I had a two thousand dollar plasma widescreen whatever then I might have some of the complaints that those do.

However, if you like your TV and have a good tint with sharp picture then these are the best on the market. Will others come? Probably. But FOX and Lucas have given some fans what they want. I don't blame or hate him. He said he could never please everyone. Perhaps he will have the last say and put everything in one big box and wrap it with a bow and charge three hundred dollars.

378643,2,6301773551,"George Lucas has already stated that ""A hundred years from now, the only version of Star Wars that anyone will remember will be the special edition DVD versions"". Mr. Lucas feels that the original versions are ""unfinished drafts and artifacts"". Most original fans consider the original versions as definative releases.

When you purchase this DVD you're actually buying the NEW (special edition) version of the film. The original version is an ""extra"" or ""bonus"". That's why no effort was put into restoring the original film. It's included here as a simple DVD extra, or as George Lucas would say, an ""artifact"" from the past.

George Lucas has NEVER FINISHED tinkering with Star Wars. Just before the release of the film in 1977 he changed the entire opening crawl and cut several characters from the film entirely. A famous quote from an ILM worker way back in 1977 was that ""George Lucas would probably still be in the projection booth (at the premiere) editing and changing the film"".

Don't get me wrong, George Lucas had every right to enhance the special effects in Star Wars. If a film relies heavily on special FX it's only natural that it may not age well as technology advances. If done correctly, an FX revamping can add new life to a film that has become dated. SuperMan the motion picture comes to mind as a film in serious need of FX revamping, especially near the end (the town flood, etc.).

Those who claim that a director should NEVER alter a classic film in ANY way are missing the point. As far as I'm concerned they can do whatever they like AS LONG AS the ""new altered version"" is NOT the only version available and being PUSHED as a ""replacement"" for the original. If the original version has been given the proper treatment that a classic film deserves (which hasn't happened with star wars) then by all means have fun to your hearts content with special ""revamped"" editions.

Fans of Star Wars have always wanted one simple thing, to have MORE of the classic film that they love. This means a completely RESTORED original version with an added bonus of ALL of the missing and cut scenes. Those scenes could be included as extras or perhaps with an OPTION to view them as an integrated part of the film. That's really not too much to ask, but instead of getting ""MORE"" of Star Wars, the fans ended up with LESS! The OVER USE of ""revamped FX"" did more to weaken the film than it did to enhance it. Again, I wouldn't mind the ""new"" versions AT ALL if the ORIGINAL VERSIONS were already RESTORED, AVAILABLE and treated with the respect that they deserve!

It's nice to finally see the original films on DVD. But the fact that they're a ""bonus artifact"" without proper restoration is an insult to original fans and to the film itself.

P.S.

The ""other"" ORIGINAL ""crawl"" (cut just prior to the films release):

""It is a period of CIVIL WAR in the galaxy. A brave Alliance of UNDERGROUND FREEDOM FIGHTERS has challenged the tyranny and oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE. To crush the rebellion once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new BATTLE STATION. Powerful enough to destroy an entire planet, its COMPLETION will spell CERTAIN DOOM for the champions of freedom. Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, REBEL SPACESHIPS have won their first victory in a battle with the powerful IMPERIAL STARFLEET. The Empire fears that ANOTHER defeat could bring a THOUSAND MORE solar systems into the rebellion, and IMPERIAL CONTROL over the galaxy would be LOST FOREVER.""

An -""OPTION""- to view the film with this opening would make a great ""bonus"" on a truly revamped ""classic"" edition of Star Wars. Along with the Biggs Darklighter scenes, etc.

Now let's fast forward to 2004.  I spent my money on the 2004 box trilogy.  George Lucas, you are the anti-christ!

The original theatrical DVD's does not absolve poor Lucas of his prior sins (Episodes 1-3, and the 2004 DVD trilogy disaster) BUT it will shut me up for awhile.  These releases have also taught me something.  ""Director's Cut's"" usually suck.

Star Wars is among the top flims on anyones list of the best movies of all time. Its listed at #15 by AFI... quite high considering the competition. Psycho is #18, which I think is a better movie but I digress.  So wanting a fully restored and un-edited Star Wars is not like wanting a restored ""Them!"" (a fun movie btw).

By comparision, The Godfather has also been re-edited a couple of times since its original release. But interest in the originals was high (just like it was with SW) and they were carefully cleaned then transfered to DVD with great success. The trilogy is available here pretty cheap. I recommend getting it. Just don't forget the cannoli.

So when fans (and there are many) see things like this, they don't understand why this movie doesnt get the same treatment. There is already a beautiful restoration. The only thing that needs to be done is to replace about two minutes of screen time. Working with the raw material that was used for the parts with the added special effects should be no problem. Supposedly that two minutes no longer exists. But fans consider that argument disingenuous. They say they must exist somewhere. Perhaps a set of the first movie reels in a private collection? Certainly a better option than using the last laserdisc footage.

Why the big deal? It all depends on what a movie really is. Is it mass media? Or is it a work of art? Film makers most often say its the latter. If so, then art restoration means bringing out the original work as much as possible. I suppose The Who could rerecord parts of Tommy and remove the original from ever being distributed again.

The movie on Disc 2 does not have ""Episode IV - A New Hope"" after the title disappears into the distance. To the best of my knowledge, this version has NEVER been legally available on video in any format. All video releases have had the secondary title added during the re-release. I realize this may seem minor to some people, but this is great for a fan like myself.

I do agree with many of the other reviewers about the quality. This is a complete disrespect to the movie that started it all. Plus, keep in mind that the movies in the original trilogy had ground-breaking, award-winning special effects - all hidden by CGI in later editions.

Just like I said in another review, to me, the CGI used in the special edition (Disc 1) is like adding CGI to the old Flash Gordon serials. It's not needed, and it just doesn't look right.  The movie and effects would be from different decades. There is a certain appeal to seeing old special effects. We don't need a release of a classic serial where the sparklers on the engines are replaced with CGI flames, we don't need to see classic Godzilla monsters replaced by CGI effects, and we don't need to see a ring when something explodes at the end of Star Wars.

""Star Wars"" in particular looks pinkish and fuzzy compared to the reworked ""Special Edition"" on Disc 1 of this 2-disc set. Plainly Lucas wasn't going to expend any more money than he had to on getting these original theatrical versions ready for DVD. It all feels like another nose-thumbing at the longtime fans--as though Lucas is saying, ""Okay, you got what you asked for. Happy now?""

Even so, whenever I sit down to watch ""Star Wars"" (here simply called ""Star Wars,"" the title it went by until its 1981 re-release, when the subtitle ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" was added), ""Empire"" or ""Jedi"" from start to finish, it will be via these relatively low-res transfers of the originals. It's not because they represent the nostalgia of movies I stood in line to see all those years ago, but because they simply offer better, purer storytelling, without the obsessive and revisionist tinkering that clutters up the ""digitally remastered"" (as though cleaning up the special effects was the only change that was made) 2004 versions. The George Lucas of 30 years ago, who among other things had to disguise the fact that sometimes R2-D2 was pulled along by a string, was a more inventive filmmaker than the Emperor who lorded over the CGI universe of the ""prequel"" trilogy. And I'm glad to finally have the products of that more inventive filmmaker released on DVD, even if the transfers are so indifferent.

A couple of additional thoughts (and why not, considering that Lucas had so many when preparing the ""special editions"" of the original trilogy!): It seems to me that the longtime fans who wanted a better transfer aren't  crybabies who are never satisified; they simply want the original theatrical cuts to get the same treatment on DVD as other classic movies have. For example, ""The Searchers""--one of the movies that influenced Lucas--looks downright spiffy in its newest transfer from the original VistaVision, but fans of that classic don't have to put up with dozens of wild horses digitally added to the background in order to get the best-looking DVD version. Second, I have to correct the reviewers who insist that Disc 2 is missing scenes included in the  original theatrical release. Sorry folks, Han did not confront Jabba in human form (that was an outtake which has appeared in making-of documentaries over the years, but not in the actual movie--and why would it? The actor who spoke Jabba's lines was never intended to be seen), and any extended scenes between Luke and his friend Biggs were cut before the movie was ever distributed to theatres.

378702,4,6301773551,"First - Thank you George Lucas for releasing the original versions of Episodes IV, V and VI on DVD. I know it pained you - so thanks!

Now after watching these, my gut instinct tells me that this is it friends... There will be no HD or remastered releases of the original versions. Why? Because the quality is so below what Lucasfilm normally releases (it is embarrassing), George is telling us straight that the ""real"" version of his films exist on the 2004 versions - if you want the best audio/video experience, watch that version. Lucasfilm made no efforts to update the original version in any way. These are actually of lower quality than what we saw in the theatre because you can see the degraded film quality as well as compression artifacts - most likely because these are straight transfers from original laserdisc releases.

As a result, I got the impression I was watching a DVD from the 1980's or early 1990's. Am I being picky - you tell me... I could see the defects watching on a 32"" standard CRT TV - not a HD flat screen - which would have made these looked even worse. For the best video experience, I recommend using a 12"" color CRT TV. The audio experience was also sub-par with a decent speaker system. The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack remains unchanged and you really notice it when comparing it to the 2004 versions - it just sounds flat.

Now the good news... I will still only watch these original Star Wars versions because I still enjoyed the movie more compared to the 2004 counterparts. The originals still have their soul left intact where the 2004 versions feel more like the newer episodes (I, II & III) - technically & artistically impressive but missing the human touch. George - you are a master filmmaker but I fear you have become more intimate with the technology than with the audience (there is a great Darth Vader metaphor here but I digress...)

So yes - Han Solo shoots first with Greedo (good life lesson there) - I am left wondering who and what is this Jabba the Hut character (ahhh... a little mystery), etc. When Episode IV was over, I didn't miss any of the additions made to the 2004 versions - sorry George I didn't. The changes do not add anything to the story. In fact, other than the improved audio & video quality, all other changes are just distracting. George will win the end because the new generation will watch the 2004 versions and not even know what they missed.

I could go on but since these are limited versions and George will actually surprise us by *never* releasing remastered originals, I just may purchase a back-up copy so I don't have to pay $100 per DVD on eBay 5-10 years in the future when I need a new copy.

Thanks!",1158364800,10,2688,4.509240246406571
378703,2,6301773551,"Once again, George Lucas thumbs his nose at the most die-hard fans of the original Star Wars Trilogy.

When these films were FINALLY scheduled to be released on DVD in 2004, I was elated. At last, I would be able to own these 3 classic films in digital format, with superior picture quality, superior sound - and what I most eagerly awaited - digital correction of color shifting and elimination of glitches in the old blue-screen process (most noticeable around tie fighters in some battle scenes). What I received for my patience turned my stomach. Yes, the picture and sound were enhanced - wonderful. But instead of using advances in digital technology to correct flaws in the original films, all Lucas did was add incredibly annoying slapstick CG creatures, rework scenes that had been reworked once before in the 1997 theatrical releases (George, the hangar scene with Jabba will never work, and was completely unnecessary to begin with - give it up already!) and generally fiddle with CONTENT as opposed to improving QUALITY.

Yes, I know Lucas has said he simply made the films closer to what he had wanted to create in the first place. All I can say is that I am eternally grateful he did NOT get to make ""the films he wanted to make"" in 77, 80 and 83. It is precisely the limitations of the technology at the time that made him dig down and innovate and improvise as best he could. He was forced to be more resourceful. And that resourcefulness is why those original films are so superior to the ""reworked"" versions as well as vastly superior to the second trilogy. Lucas' main flaw as a filmmaker is that he becomes too entranced with technology and gimmickery. That is why the second trilogy, while visually impressive, was so obsessive about CG that other concerns like story and performances were clearly (and shamefully) reduced to afterthoughts. If films can be called ""lazy,"" then those were lazy films.

I wanted the original versions, and not the monkeyed-with versions (which I absolutely cannot watch). I wanted them because I was a kid when these films origially came out in theatres. I saw them repeatedly in their first runs. And the thing about films like those is that they have a cadence to them - a progression and rhythm from one scene to the next that you get used to and that becomes familiar to you. These films become old friends that you know and recognize. And any interruption in that cadence by fiddling with content makes them feel like strangers.  I wanted my old friends back.

So now, finally, the Original Theatrical Versions are available on DVD for the first time. I wasted no time in picking them up. And once again, I feel shafted. Is it really asking so much to have the original films in anamorphic widescreen and 5.1 Surround? And Lucas STILL hasn't bothered to correct any of the blue-screen glitches!!!!!! I could burn a good VHS copy to DVD and get about the same results. This is Lucas' response to the clamouring from his oldest and most die-hard fans for the original versions? Such a response feels nothing less than spiteful.",1158364800,15,3082,4.710575139146568
378704,1,6301773551,"Ok, if you don't own any DVD copy of Star Wars than these DVDs are worth something I guess. The problem is, that many people (including myself) will buy them for the original theatrical release versions on the bonus DVD. And the quality is abysmal.

These original theatrical transfers look as if they were re-recorded from filming a projector. No only that they are LETTERBOX versions. What! That is just plain addle brained in this day of HDTV and wide screen TVs. I don't expect detail where is did not exist but I do expect to be able to play the thing in the correct aspect ration and not have more than 1/3 of the DVD be wasted on coding black bars. Not only that, my DVD player can not even zoom in the correct aspect ration to eliminate the LETTERBOX. Even if have a setup that does this correctly, you will be zooming in on an already craptastic transfer.

For example, there is quite a bit of color-shifting throughout most of the movie which can be seen clearly through the flesh tones. It almost looks like they forgot to remove the macrovision copy protection and you have an illegal copy. The results are a muddy mess and there is no way that this is all they could do with the original release.

For those that are saying you got what ""you asked for"" read some of the earlier posts. There are tons of digital re-mastered version of old movies that look ten times better. What ""we asked for"" is the original movie content. We are not against digital repair of poor color, grain, jitter, etc.

Bottom line is, this is a horrendous transfer of the original movies. If you are buying it for these original versions you will probably be somewhat disappointed especially if you have a wide screen TV of any sort.

I am just sick of these crappy re-releases of the only good Star Wars films. I guess now they will re-re-re-release an better (but probably still messed up) version on HD-DVD in 2 years. Sadly, you should wait until then before you buy.",1158364800,16,1959,4.476190476190476

378787,4,6301773551,"Fans have been clammoring for the original versions of the Star Wars films to be released on DVD since the dawning of the format.  Finally, we have these films.  Sure, this is not anamorpic widescreen or a new transfer from the master print of the film, but it looks damned good on my circa 1995 standard def TV set.  Now, I can understand the backlash against this from those who have state of the art equipment, because when I threw the disc into my 17"" Powerbook, the image was less than stellar...extremely grainy.  I'm sure this is how the film is going to look on the best home theatre set-ups today.  However, I generally don't watch movies on my laptop, and, like I said earlier, this disc looks great on my TV set.  Crystal clear.  Just as a comparison, I threw my ""Faces"" laserdisc and my ""Special Widescreen Edition"" laserdisc in to my LD player and noticed that this DVD is leaps and bounds above the laserdiscs, which means that no matter what bootleg you have that was made from a transfer of the laserdisc, this is going to be better just because the source material is better (laserdisc master rather than laserdisc).

So, it's a matter of what equipment you have really.  If you don't have the best TV set and home theatre system (like myself) and you want the original Star Wars, the way you saw it when you were a kid, then buy these discs.  If you do have some of the better equipment, you may want to avoid.  For me, this is good enough for now, and I am extremely happy with being able to watch what looks like a crystal clear copy of the film for the first time ever.",1158364800,8,1590,4.3559322033898304
378788,4,6301773551,"OK, All I have wanted for years now is to see the original Trilogy without flipping a laserdisc.  Now, I have that ability.

As for the comments on George Lucas's tinkering with his movies, he is not the first to do such things, but he may be the first in this type of medium to be able to do so.  For instance, Samuel Taylor Colridge and W. B. Yeats published different versions of their poems, and never appologized for it.  The rub is that they never tried to de-value their original works either.  They offered alternate versions with updates.  I would like to believe that Lucas is offering that, now.

With that said, the original versions of the Star Wars Trilogy have scars.  People who have been watching Star Wars and living with it as part of their childhood will notice some remaining evidence of tinkering.  A notable one would be the epileptic yellow flashes Lucas put in during the fight between O-B-One and Darth Vader in Star Wars.  It is kind of like having a good friend back after they go off and make some questionable life-decisions.  They are going to have scars, but at least they are the friend you remember and not some weird guy that looks the same but is trying too hard to be himself.",1158364800,,1213,4.468181818181818

(Basically,  a rectangular (widescreen) image is squeezed onto a square frame and during projection a special lens is attached to the projector to expand the image to its original width on the screen.

What does any of this have to do with my DVD, DVD player or television? None contain a projector, lens, or  70MM print of  STAR WARS.

Is ""animorphic"" in DVD terms something completely different?

IF so it should be called by a different term to avoid confusion.

is ANIMOPHIC in DVD something to do with playing the film on a widescreen/ high definition TV?

IF so this doesnt matter to me since I own a very sharp video projector with a fine lens and have a wide screen in my living room.

It looks about as good as the images i seee projected in movie theatres.

so I have no beef.

first in 1992  lucasfilm released the  star wars trilogy on limited edition vhs and laser disc the tagline was "" the original trilogy..one last time""  but i knew  that wasn't so, then comes the 1997 star wars trilogy special editions in the theaters(and later on video )  it was a great time to be a star wars fan  then  came the prequel trilogy  excellent!!.. jump to september 2004  the special editions are finally released onto dvd...and they were worth the wait.. then shortly after that they release a box set of just the stripped down dvd set of the special editions  ... i have all these versions except the stripped down version  i saw that pointless  go figure...  just having the star wars films became a collection of sorts LOL  i even have the  laser disc  versions  as well as  my original beta formats(those are collectors items )

theres no excuse not to  have the star wars films in your collection anymore ! and we also know they will come on blu ray  sometime also..

jump to 2006,  in the words of threepio  ""here we go again""  it seems one of the parts of being a star wars fan is having to buy, every few years a new version of the film..which is not uncommon with hollywood studios these days

dont get me wrong.. im not ragging on this release unlike a lot of people here on amazon are...but  we already know lucas will release a special box set of all 6 films with new added footage etc  there was a lot of material left on the cutting room floor such as the biggs/luke scenes from episode IV .. and there was also a lot of material cut from episodes I,II III, V, and IV..lots to look forward to..

 lucasfilm  now gives us the star wars trilogy  dvds sold seperatly with  this version has the 2004 special edition release dvd and for the bonus dvd  because of overwhelming fan requests(myself included)..THE original 1977 release of star wars ..a new hope...but wait  empire and jedi are out also with their original versions as well... at first,i wasn't sure if i was going to get any of these releases.

 a few nights ago, my dvd of episode 4 got messed up, so i got a copy of this release.the special edition is the same  so that no problem...but to have the classic version we grew up with  on dvd is worth the price!..  i loved seeing the scene where han solo shoots greedo first in the cantima...that was a defining moment for the character...and i did not like the idea that they changed it for the special edition..hans shifting  to avoid greedo's blast never looked natural..it looks jerky at best..

but to be honest, its great to have the original on dvd  the video is of  good quality  ..lucasfilm said they took the original versions from the laser disc  masters for the dvd production..and they did a good job  it looks cleaned up..but  you have to wonder did they tweak it a bit here and there ...some scenes i was saying to myself..that was added for the special edition.. and its fun to speculate  but you have to have a good eye for that kind of thing...Lucas always likes to tinker with his films.. and thats a double edged sword..

if you never bought the special editions when they came out in 2004..grab this set..you get both versions...its a bargin...the only thing i did not like was the fact there was no  documentaries for the  original version ..it would have been nice to see a message from  lucas to  the fans about this release..we have been waiting years for the originals to  be put onto dvd..  thank you george!

to the people saying that this version was rushed, and put out just for quick cash..i say don't breath too much into this...just sit back ,relax, and  enjoy ...i remember seeing episode IV opening night in 1977..i was 5 years old..this brings back fond memories..

 Im  looking forward to seeing the new  clone wars series and the proposed live action tv series (star trek watch out)  but more importantly..when will we  get to see episodes 7,8,and 9 ?? ...theres so much story to continue with.. because i remember reading a article  after return of the jedi came out..that lucas said there will be no more star wars films  then years later  came episode 1  you have to keep the faith

  These editions are more than you could possibly ask for.  First of all, the originals are finally out! 2nd of all - HDTV, Anamorphic (which is NOT the original aspect of this film), and 5.1 is not needed for these movies! If you want this watch the NEW special editions, and just block the new scenes out and replace them in your mind with the old ones, we've all done it.

  My point goes like this.  It's almost like you all (all = the ones reviewing this edition harshly) are saying that the old version isn't enough like the special editions.  It's old, and it's going to look old.  The only thing you could validly complain about is if there was any  actual downfall from going to DVD format, which there isn't, it  makes it look the best it possibly can.  If you don't want it, don't buy it, and certainly don't complain about it. older movies generally look bad on HDTV, especially old Sci-fi flicks.  George Lucas made these movies didn't he?  is he drugging you to buy them? I don't think so.

  My entire point here? get over it!  you don't have to buy these, if you like Star Wars you like Star Wars.  I have these and the 2004 edition of the special edition trilogy.  If you are true Star Wars fans you should be happy that you can buy them in different editions, aren't most Star Wars fans collectors anyway?  I just don't see this as something to complain about.

378835,4,6301773551,"STAR WARS is a cinematic and cultural phenomenon.  It has a winning combination of action, strong characters, and humor mixed with a spiritual message.  At once borrowing from other films and Saturday matinee serials, STAR WARS also has inspired thousands of films since its release.  This film made Dolby Stereo the dominant sound format in cinema and redefined what a blockbuster film would be.  Its groundbreaking visual effects won Academy Awards for their creators and paved the way for most special-effects films that followed.

 The first disk is essentially the same as the DVD released in 2004.  The original visual effects have been replaced with computer generated ones without much impact on the film's entertainment value or structure.  The soundtrack has been mixed for Dolby 5.1 with minor additions made to the soundtrack.  Extended footage of dewbacks, the Mos Eisley Spaceport, and Jabba the Hutt extend the length of the film without enhancing it.  However, the modification of several scenes, especially Han Solo's introduction, deprives the film of a character arc and detracts from the special edition.

 The only reason to buy this DVD is for the ""bonus material"" of the original version of the film.  After thirty years my memory may be faulty, but I recall the film having different opening title cards and closing credits from the ones shown in this DVD.  As reported, this DVD is not anamorphic and is based mostly on a previous video transfer of the film.  The picture is better than I was expecting on a wide-screen, high definition television set.  Unfortunately, the subtitles for the scene of Han Solo are cropped off the bottom of a wide-screen television when the picture is expanded to fill the screen.  The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack is lackluster.

 Those with standard definition television sets should have no hesitance in purchasing this DVD for its ""bonus material.""  Watching it on a high-definition television involves trade-offs that would have been avoided with a typical anamorphic DVD.  Because of the character changes made in the special edition, the original film is the better film.  Film buffs should appreciate seeing what cutting-edge visual effects were in 1977.

Finally we get the unaltered original ""Star Wars"". There's no new digital effects, no additions to the plot and we also get the digitally enhanced, altered version in the same package. So how does the picture look for the 1977 version? It looks fair compared to current standards for DVD. Using the original 1993 transfers for laserdisc as the source Lucasfilm cleaned up the original a bit in preparation for its DVD debut. It's not presented in anamorphic widescreen (which means the picture quality isn't as good as for the other version. That translates to less lines of resolution and a less sharp picture overall). Colors are inconsistent but considering the age of the film that's not surprising. The images are darker and there's a lot of film grain evident again no surprise. It's a pity that the film wasn't cleaned up more and restored for its DVD debut but we'll probably see some enhancement in that area (one hopes) in the deluxe boxed set that Lucas plans next year for the 30th Anniversary of Star Wars.

I do find it disturbing though that Lucas made no effort to restore the film. It's almost like a spoiled child giving you something you've asked for. They DO hand it over but there's a lot of pouting and it's clear that it's not something they want to do. I would think that Lucas who grew up on classic horror, science fiction and adventure films would appreciate wanting the films the same way that he remembers them. It's a way to relive those childhood moments and pass them on to your children as well. I would still think that he's proud of his accomplishment of turning a $10 million movie into a $200 million + blockbuster that connected with audiences and present it in the best way possible (much how ""Veritgo"" or even ""Touch of Evil"" were restored for home video). I'd suggest a nice long talk with Robert Harris who restored ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"". 3 stars for the image and sound quality of the first film 5 stars for the second.

The digitally enhanced version looks terrific. I didn't see any differences here compared to the previous release.

However, this ""theatrical release"" suffers from more than faded bad print and schlock soundtrack -- it's obviously a dub from TELEVISION, because the opening scene where Leia's ship is chased by the starcruiser is TIME COMPRESSED!

In fact, to get a feel for what the original felt like in red plush movie theater seats, you have to watch the opening sequence from Spaceballs!  The first (the very, very first!) star cruiser came into view, and came into view, and came into view, and the small recessed bay appeared, and the ship continued, and the LARGE recessed bay appeared and went by, and went by, and the ship continued, and the end of the ship appeared, and went by.

Ok, I can understand why Lucas hates that scene, because really it only works the first time you see it -- as Mel Brooks understood very well in his parody of the shot.  But really...  Really, now!

I don't have my television hooked up to expensive stereo equipment so the sound is great in my opinion.  Part of what makes Star Wars (this original film and the first in the series) so fantastic is that it was able to draw you into an alien world without digital effects (although at the time it came out the special effects were super!).  I have attempted to watch the revamped versions in the past and get SO turned off each time.  I can pretty much guarantee that I will never watch more than what is on the bonus disk.

378843,5,6301773551,"At what point did the technology and media used to view a film become more important than the film itself?

Could the picture quality be better?  Maybe, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it and probably looks just as good as it did when I saw it as an impressionable five-year-old back in '77.  Is the soundtrack ""only"" in stereo, and not 5.1 surround?  Yep, but that's how I heard it back then, too.

The fact of the matter is the ""bonus"" disc contains the original, unedited, unaltered version of the film as George Lucas presented to us- the same film that had such a huge impact upon myself and thousands of other kids growing up in the late 70's and early 80's.

It offends me that Lucas felt the need to tamper with the original trilogy.  Would the creators of Casablanca go back and colorize the picture because it was shot in black and white?  Would Hitchcock start buggering up his movies simply out of boredom, or because the technology allowed him to do so?  I doubt it.  So what gives Lucas the right?

And why are we more concerned with sound formats and aspect ratios than with the content of the movie we're watching at home?  A great movie is a great movie, whether seen on a 12-inch black-and-white television or on a state of the art home theatre system. It's the content we should be concerned with, plain and simple.  Do we watch this film over and over for the characters and story, or because of an anamorphic transfer and surround sound?  Star Wars was made in 1977, with the technology of the day.  Does it look dated by today's technological standards?  You bet it does, and I love it for it.

For those who wish to be able to watch the films that were such an important and enjoyable part of their childhood, I HIGHLY recommend this two disc set.  You won't be disappointed.  I can't wait to pick up Empire and Jedi next; these are the versions I'll introduce my five month old son to.  For those who're impressed by today's CGIed, surround sound explosion fests, void of any real content, characters, or story, pass on it and wait for Georgie Boy and the next round of home theatre technology to ""new and improve"" the trilogy.",1158278400,11,2161,4.478260869565218

The bootleg DVDs I purchased years ago that were burned from the laser disks look better than the movies on the bonus disks. Kinda shocking, actually, because I can't figure out how that happened! Re the non-anamorphic transfers, I am not personally disturbed because I do not own a HDTV. Still, for those who do, and since I might purchase a HDTV in the future, it is more than very disappointing that Lucasfilm didn't spend the approximately $100,000 it would have cost to do anamorphic transfers so that the films would fill up the widescreen without distortion or loss of picture quality. I'm not concerned about the Dolby 2.0 because, as has been noted, that's what was available when the films came out. If Lucasfilm had just done the anamorphic transfer and made sure that the films were no worse than the old laserdisks, I would have been happy.

378915,3,6301773551,"We are given 2-DVD releases where the films in the much sought-after original 1977/83 STAR WARS Trilogy are relegated to the status of ""bonus discs,"" a remarkably cynical move even for Lucas and Fox, who know full well that very few people actually want the dreadful 1997/2004 revisions that have been around on DVD for two years. These ""bonus discs"" are largely non-cleaned-up, low-definition, non-anamorphic transfers based on the 1993 laser discs. The picture is actually not bad, all things considered--better, in fact, than any other issuance of the originals (which admittedly appeared in media far inferior to the DVD); but with a little effort, they could have been so much better--especially for folks with 16x9 TVs. The 2.0 sound is more than adequate--actually rather clearer than the 5.1 mess that was produced for the 2004 disasters. Ironically, it is the 2.0 mix, not the 2004 5.1 remix, which is more similar to, though less complex than, the 6-channel, non-digital, non-surround stereo that was heard theatrically 30 years ago.

A couple of interesting details: one reviewer felt that these DVDs were worse than the 1995 VHS tapes, which he remembered as having been better cleaned up. In point of fact, the LDs from 1993 and the LDs/VHS tapes from 1995 were the *same* THX remasterings--just packaged differently; having seen both, I can say confidently that neither are nearly as good as these still-below-par DVDs. Moreover, the 1993/5 THX versions from which these DVDs were transferred are full of print damage at the same points--odd for a THX mastering; it means that even for what he said would be the *final* release in 1995, Lucas *already* didn't care about the old versions, as he was about to embark upon his 1997 distortions! Another important point: not all of these DVDs are direct LD transfers. For STAR WARS, the LD, and *every* home video version since the film first appeared on VHS, had the later title scroll that included ""Episode IV A New Hope."" This one, nicely, does not--the first time in a home video release! However, either good elements for this truly original opening do not survive or were not searched for hard enough because the whole frame rocks from side to side somewhat--owing to uneven print shrinkage: it's disconcerting to see a sky full of stars that all move back and forth together. This could have been cleaned up along with the many other points of print damage in the source material. One last observation: someone said that the opening sequence in STAR WARS is time-compressed. That is rubbish: all earlier versions have identical running times *to the second*! Let's not savage Mr. Lucas when he doesn't deserve it, folks.

The problem with allowing George Lucas to clean up, or even anamorphically enhance, *anything* in his original STAR WARS Trilogy is that he obviously wouldn't know when to quit, and we'd get another non-original permutation. It's a shame because far older films have been restored to look much better than the 1977-83 STAR WARS originals in their new DVD releases. Films of this cultural significance deserve far better. But since Lucas can't be trusted not to tinker, perhaps we should be satisfied while we're ahead, even though the results are compromised. If the originals ever do get issued in cleaner and higher-definition, anamorphically enhanced versions, you can bet that something will also be missing--again! My guess, however, is that Lucas regards his first versions merely as historical artifacts, remembering all the grief they caused him in the making; he obviously prefers to forget about them, continuing to insist that his most recent thoughts, however inferior we all find them, are the standards. It also occurs to me that Fox is testing the market: sure, thousands have been clamoring for the genuine films for years, but they wanted to see if we'd shell out the cash even for technically outmoded versions. Well, now we have. Perhaps they will realize that, despite how much we are currently protesting about Fox's (and perhaps Lucas') greed, when the originals are restored--not changed, just restored, preferably without Mr. Lucas' ""assistance""--we will, in fact, buy them. In the meantime, these are better than nothing. Watch them on a 4x3 SDTV.",1158192000,20,4262,5.052556818181818

378917,2,6301773551,"I was not planning on getting these but my wife went ahead and got them for me anyway.

After checking out the each of the movies it is obvious that not very much at all was done to improve over the original laserdisk versions. This was a real dissapointment and got me a bit mad as Star Wars fans have given Lucas tons of money for years and for quite a while fans wanted the original movies released on DVD. Now it seems a spiteful and greedy George Lucas and company dumps this uninspired attempt at releasing the original movies on DVD to the fans that have supported him all these years.

So here is the final breakdown...

PROS: Finally a DVD release of the original movies! Quality is better than any pirated laserdisk DVD conversion I have seen.

CONS: No noticeable video or audio improvments over the original laserdisk version makes these DVDs substandard when compared to what is normally done when a DVD is professionally produced.

One other interesting note... It seems the DVD that has the original movie on it is the ""bonus"" disk of the set and the altered 2004 version is the ""main"" disk of the set. Anyone with common sense knows that nearly everyone buying these DVDs is getting them for the original movie not the revised 2004 version! The original movie should be the ""main"" DVD of the set and the other one should be called ""trash"" or whatever you call something that is pointless to watch. Just another example of Lucas and company refusing to accept the fact that most prefer the original Star Wars rather than the ""new"" & ""improved"" versions of the movies. They should have simply released the original movie and reduced the price for not needing to produce a second DVD.",1158192000,17,1697,4.587458745874588
378918,4,6301773551,"Would a digitally re-mastered transfer look better?  Of course.  Do I wish it was anamorphic?  Of course.  Is there some grain and light scratching over composite elements?  Yes.  Maybe one or two matte boxes over X-Wings?  Yep.

But the fact is, this transfer looks better, pound for pound, than when I originally saw it in the theatre back in 1977 (even before the print had been played a million times).  Even pristine i saw more grain at the cinema, more matte boxes, and more scratching over elements.

Yes, it could be better.  But it seems a lot of people have some warped sense of reality, expecting the picture quality to reach some level of  perfection that never existed in the first place.  They want some artificially perfect creation, with 5.1 sound as the perfect symbol of modern improvements that never existed in the original.

Do you want the original film, and all its original technical flaws, or do you want some dolled up restoration that only exists because new technology created it?

I love these DVDs.  Sure, Lucas took the cheap and easy route.  Sure, he did it for a quick buck.  But I have some of my favorite movies now, looking just as good or better than I remember seeing them back in 1977, 1980, and 1983.

Why all the whining?  Because technology has created an artificial idea of what it's SUPPOSE to look like, nevermind that it never looked as good to start with.

However if you own the earlier DVD box set do not bother waisting your money on these low resolution bad audio transfer original films. Lucas is at his tricks again getting more bucks out of Star Wars fans while holding out on us. I work in technology and I know that the transfer of these original films is low and was done on purpose. Could have been much better. True Star Wars fans just wait out the time because the originals will be released again when Lucas teams with Sony and Blue Ray and helps them in their push against HD DVD for the future of DVD viewing. As he has proven in the past George wants to get all out of us that he can so this current release is nothing but a teaser for what is to come in the next couple of years.,1158192000,6,940,4.032085561497326
378920,2,6301773551,"Those reviewers who are suggesting this wouldn't be the original theatrical version if it was anamorphic are talking rubbish I'm afraid.  To release a film anamorphically is not to tamper with the film one bit, an anamorphic transfer simply makes use of all 525 lines (in the case of NTSC) vertical resolution.  A non-anamorphic transfer only uses a fraction of those lines.

Plus alien-language subtitles tend to fall off the bottom of the screen when it's zoomed from 4:3 to 16:9.  An anamorphic release would have avoided this.  That's assuming you lot with widescreen displays are actually watching the movie correctly in ""zoom"" mode rather than in stretched 16:9 mode!

Sure, to remix the sound into 5.1 would, perhaps, have been wrong.  And frankly I'm glad they didn't after the mess they made of the 5.1 track on the SE release (they mixed the reverse music channels up!).  But to not release this film in anamorphic widescreen is lazy and sloppy and suggests that a better release is on the cards.

Due to increasing demand from the Star Wars fanbase/community, Lucas had decided to give his fans what they want. Untouched versions of the Original Trilogy, the actual '77, '80 and '83 releases of the fims.

If you are buying these and expecting to get the 'Prequel Trilogy quality' (in other words, the latest special effects, 5.1 sourround sound, etc) from these movies, then i'm sorry, that is just not the case. If you have jumped on the bandwagon because of the Prequel Trilogy, then you may also not like these. If you do not wish to watch the original trilogy, in it's original form, buy the 3-disc box set. It is much cheaper and you only get the touched up versions of the films. But saying that, these 2-disc sets (one set for each of the three films), of each movie, do have the touched up versions aswel  as the original versions (the 1st disc contains the touched up '04 versions and the 2nd disc contains the original '77, '80 or '83 versions), but the main reason that anyone is buying these is because of the original releases. Otherwise you would just buy the 3-disc box set.

To those of you that have written reviews and are shocked at the original versions, what exactly were you all expecting when they announce ""We are releasing the original trilogy in its original, threatrical, untouched (also known as 'outdated') form""? I'm quite sure that 5.1 or hiher quality sound didn't exsist almost 30 years ago. Digital technology was almost non-exsistant. When they say untouched form, they mean untouched form.

Summing up, I recommend for the die-hard Star Wars fan. But for those just wanting to see the movies, just because they are movies and not because they are SW, buy the 3-disc box set or buy these versions and don't complain about them being outdated.

379001,5,6301773551,"I don't understand how some can criticise these movies based on the aspect ratio of the picture, especially when they obviously can't do basic math.

There are four different anamorphic, or widescreen, ratios on the market: 16:9, 1.77:1, 1.85:1, and 2.35:1.

1.77:1 is the closest to 16:9, converting to 15.93:9

1.85:1 converts to 16.65:9 ... so the picture is slightly taller

2.35:1 converts to 16.45:7 ... so the picture is both wider and shorter, giving it an even wider appearance

For future reference for the math-impaired, the full-screen ratio of 4:3 reduces to 1.33:1.

Based on silly complaints over the aspect ratio and on silly complaints about how many times Lucas will release these films (I don't see George twisting any arms, forcing people to buy them), I've given this 5-stars, to help offset such obviously whacky complaints, and because I'm simply happy to see the original releases now on DVD, and because they're simply great films!

EDIT (16.09.06): Okay, so I showed my ignorance with what I wrote above and revealed that I really didn't know what ""anamorphic"" means. That is, until I did a little bit of research on it. But that's hardly the most important thing, is it?

When the first Star Wars film came out, my family had just returned to the US after living in England for 3 years. I was 17, about to start my senior year of high school, and sitting in my grandparents' living room when I saw the first trailer on TV, and I knew right then that I just HAD to see this movie!

I for one don't care that these aren't anamorphic or that they don't have 5.1 surround. I haven't even the equipment to enjoy such things. All I wanted was the original films, without the additions found in the later releases, and in widescreen format (letterbox or otherwise and no matter what the bloody aspect ratio, as long as it's not 4:3). I have them in widescreen on VHS, and now I've got them in widescreen on DVD (I think the full-screen format, which these are not, absolutely ruins the composition and art of the original image of any film). With a 31"" Hitachi ""old fashioned"" TV -- a TV that is now going on 12 years old, as a matter of fact -- I'm quite happy with what I've got. It's the stories that I love, not the technology that delivers them.

I think that's what has bothered me about a lot of the reviews. People are not sounding like they really wanted the original films on DVD. What they wanted and what they love are the bells and whistles, and now they're pissed that no bells are ringing and that the whistles are lacking those little balls inside. They criticise George for 'hacking' up the original films with those admittedly horrid additions, and they criticise George for going hog-wild with CGI graphics in the most recent trilogy, and then they show themselves as guilty as George of the same sins when what they moan about is the lack of technology with this release. George forgot that the story is primary in his lust for technology (especially with the last three films), and the same now seems to be true of many others. As a writer of fiction, I think that's sad. Story HAS to be more important than anything else. Without that, movies, stage plays, TV shows, novels, and short stories are just a huge waste of time and money.

With these DVDs (I purchased all three), you get the original films, and you get them in widescreen format. For me, those are the most important things. If what you want are electronically simulated bells and CGI rendered whistles (who needs those annoying little balls anyway when you can generate them with a computer?), then move on to the next stall. Otherwise, what you'll find here are good, old-fashioned cracked bells, and plastic whistles with plastic balls, but at least you'll know they're the genuine articles, and not ""authentic replicas.""",1158105600,7,3829,4.657777777777778

I remember seeing them in the theater at eight years old, (Star Wars) eleven years old (Empire Strikes Back) and fourteen years old (Jedi). The original film has simple two channel stereo. I remember the original movies had pops and cracks in the theater. There were discrepancies in the film. 13 year olds will not likely remember those days, but doing this movie in ""new, better"" style will get in the way of the real memories. The magic will be gone. In regard to the criticism that the movies are presented in full screen- are your copies like that? If so, they must be some rare special pan-and-scan editions. Mine are all letterbox, which is good because I generally hate pan-and-scan. They are not anamorphic, but they are complete. They may not fill the screen of a modern TV set (nor do I really care because I am still using one of those ""old"" 4:3 television sets) but they are better than the original video release.

However, I'm sorely hacked how HUGE the letterbox is.  My god.  I have other versions that are older than Star Wars that doesn't have this big of a letterbox.  It's every bit as big as the letterbox from the original VHS version.

I think that is an annoyance.  This is because really this is not that much different than the VHS tapes.  It is merely a convenience for those who don't have VCRs anymore.

Yes, it's about freaking time Lucas released these original movies.  Don't give me that BS that there aren't anymore copies of the original and how Lucasfilms ""exhaustively"" searched the vault just to make the movie.  That's the biggest lie I've ever heard.

There is no way Lucas would EVER destroy completely the original copy.  Furthermore, there isn't just ONE copy of the original 3 movies existing.  Sorry, I will never believe that.  There were copies made straight after production.  It's standard for any major motion picture.

It's a good purchase for those who want the DVD version of Star Wars, but really with the exception that it is a bit better version (not as grainy) as the VHS version, it's no different.

God...that letterbox...I realize that they didn't make it 16:9.  But for crying out loud, the letterbox is unnecessarily too big.  I know they could have reduced the letterbox at least by 1/4.  Right now on my screen, Chewbacca is perhaps 16 or 17 inches tall on a 34"" widescreen TV.

I dont' care about getting 5.1 surround sound or better quality of video.  Just reduce the letterbox a bit.",1158105600,4,1719,4.641196013289036
379064,5,6301773551,"Before I begin, I must ask... why are people allowed to review an item on this site before it's even released?  The first review was posted in May.  Another thing, most people who rate this one star, or want to rate it zero stars, probably didn't purchase and view the actual movie.  Finally, George Lucas owns the movie, and can release them as many times as he wants.  You don't have to buy every version!

Now, a review:

My kudos go out to George Lucas. Perhaps he doesn't deserve them after all this time, but I'm feeling generous. The reason for my good feelings? Mr. Lucas has finally released Star Wars on DVD.

That's right... Star Wars.

Not ""Episode 4"" and certainly not ""A New Hope"".

It is and always was Star Wars. And now there's real proof...

He thought he could keep it hidden this whole time, but in 1977, he really did release a movie simply titled Star Wars. He tried to fool the public with one ""Super-Duper-Action-Total-Extreme Edition"" after another, but people like me just couldn't take it any more. We begged and we pleaded to have the classic, true movie back, and finally he's thrown people like me a bone.

Man oh man, it makes me so happy.

I understand that it's supposedly a cheap transfer from the Laserdisc version, rather than remastered from the original print. I find that may actually be a good thing.

Pop the disc in and start the movie up... First thing I noticed when the 20th Century Fox screen appeared was a huge dark scratch near the top. In another part of the movie, a green tint appeared on the left. There were white spots dancing around one of the Death Star interior shots. Several long shots showed dark spots in the corner of the screen and aliasing in the background.

DVD connoisseurs and people with HD plasma TVs will probably find these things annoying, noting that this could have been corrected to make the picture clearer. A film transfer would also increase the resolution for widescreen TVs. They may also find it annoying that the audio is in Dolby 2.0 surround, rather than the high quality 5.1.

I see this all differently... all these imperfections prove this to be exactly what I want. This copy truly is unaltered! No changes made! An honest-to-goodness, unbastardized version of Star Wars!

And it's all here, folks. No computer-created aliens... no scenes extended pointlessly with Imperial walkers... no green-screen sets... no Jabba the Hutt... and Han shoots first! Hooray!

And most interesting of all, no... how do I say it? Episode-ness!!!

The Fox logo fades out, simple green lettering tells us this is ""A Lucasfilm Limited Production,"" a short dark pause, ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,"" then ""Star Wars"" framed by stars, zooms away as the title music plays, and the opening crawl... with no subtitle!

All these years people called me crazy for refering to this film as ""Star Wars"". Most people would say, ""Which one do you mean?"" My frustration was not in vain! It's finally back...

Star Wars

And for those with big HD TV's, or those who simply can't stand imperfections, relax. In this apparent ""Ultra Secret Limited Edition"" not only do you get Star Wars, but you also get the most recent version (I think it would be 2.5.1?) of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope as an extra!

Okay, so in reality, Star Wars is considered the bonus here, and Episode IV is the movie you're buying. In this, it's basically a bare-bones release, containing the movie, with commentaries, subtitle options, and your choice of English, French, or Spanish dialog. I think the bonus disc also includes a trailer for Lego Star Wars or something...

If you're really a DVD junkie, you'll miss out on the bonus documentaries included in more recent box sets (the gold and silver ones available last Christmas). Only buy this version if you're disenchanted with the constant updating (there will be at least one more version next year) Mr. Lucas dishes out. The only special part of this release is the inclusion of the original, theatrical version of Star Wars.

For a guy that grew up watching that movie maybe once a week, that's plenty for me.

-Dave

Note: This movie currently does not appear in a box-set. It was released as a single on the same day as identical versions of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi appeared in stores. This is certainly not the last time the classic Star Wars Trilogy will show up in stores, but may be the only time the original theatrical versions are available. I made sure to reserve my copy so I wouldn't miss it, since I have a tendency to procrastinate. Plus, knowing Mr. Lucas, I'm sure once a designated amount of time has passed, every copy not sold will be hunted down and burned in effigy. Maybe not, but I won't take that chance.",1158105600,9,4762,4.639285714285714

The new DVD looks OK to me. At $14.95 it hardly qualifies as a rip-off and it's a vast improvement over the old copy of Eposide IV that I have on Betamax tape.

379066,4,6301773551,"Although this is going to sound like common sense for most people, this specific Star Wars release is for individuals who either have not already purchased the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD or have been waiting around for George Lucas to release the Original Theatrical Version on DVD. If you have no interest in owning a copy of Star Wars or the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD before the 1997 Special Edition or 2004 Digital Remastering, then this set of movies is not for you.

However, if you are a Star Wars purist, have an artistic interest in the evolution of the Star Wars Trilogy, or want to reconnect to the movies that began it all (before they were tweaked), then I would highly recommend purchasing this version without reservation.

With regard to the movies themselves, I have to remark that the transfer could have been better; there is no reason that these movies should not have been touched up, provided with a 5.1 Digital surround sound (Dolby or DTS), or remastered with an anamorphic widescreen. The fact that the DVDs lack these features hints at the fact that Lucas did not take his time in providing a set for the fans of the original trilogy but instead decided to make a feign attempt to placate those individuals who have been begging for a set of these movies on DVD as they were originally produced.

For individuals who are hesitant, I would recommend waiting to purchase them because historically nothing released by George Lucas is truly for ""a limited time only."" Additionally, there is a good chance that another set or boxed set will be released next year in order to celebrate 30 years of Star Wars. Also keep in mind that once Blu-Ray and HD-DVD players become standard household devices we will see another release of these movies; probably with the same ""limited edition"" label attached.

Hopefully, those who do decide that it is worthwhile to pick up a copy will be pleased to finally own a version of the Star Wars Trilogy that reflects the movies they saw and fell in love with for the first time

Side note: for people who are interested in the scene between Biggs and Luke Skywalker that took place on Tatooine but was cut from the movie and hasn't been provided on any DVD version; this film footage can be found in the ""Star Wars: Behind the Magic"" for Win95/98 PC CD-ROM.

I had no idea if they'd ever be released, but I had them on laserdisc, and had a working laser player, so I didn't see a reason to 'upgrade' if it wasn't really what I wanted.

I don't resent Lucas for releasing the ""Star Wars"" films so many times, and in so many versions.  I'm not powerless in the purchasing process, so I'll just get the versions that I want.

We can finally see Star Wars the way we fell in love with it, not the way Lucas has revised it and re-re-re-re-re-released it. Then I found out it was not to be anamorphic, what IS this guy thinking?

Here's what he's thinking. Toss out the OT (which he claims he has no love for anymore) as a 'bonus' on discs he released already to get people foolish enough to buy them. I had bought all the editions on VHS but have only 1 edition of each on DVD of the prequels and redone OT. I will not buy this movie AGAIN just because Lucas wants to release the same thing again with the only addition being a subpar copy of the OT. The speckling and lack of anamorphic for widescreen TV's in todays world, not to mention no 5.1 sound update is just plain wrong and very poor marketing. Sure, there will be the fanboys who will run right out and snatch it up and the casual fan as well but the bulk of the fanboys and girls will avoid this one. We've grown sick of his handling of the OT, not showing this brilliant movie the respect it deserves. Lucas seems to forget without this 'horrible' OT, he'd be nothing near what he is today.

George, if you want to release the OT properly and with respect then do so on its own. Do not include it in some box set because we're tired of these 'special editions, for the last time, never to be seen again' treatments you put out like every year. The series is a classic (although the prequels 1 & 2 pretty much sucked, especially killing off Darth Maul and ROTJ has always been a non-favorite amongst the fans) so treat it with respect. Until you do so, I know I will not be buying any more SW one-offs or 'box sets'. I have the six movies, no more thanks.",1158105600,8,1801,4.172413793103448

Nevertheless, the original theatrical versions, as presented, look quite respectable on normal, good-quality (if not HD) 4:3 TVs or monitors; they are basically crisp and correctly colored, better than any VHS, LD, or unauthorized, private DVD-R made from the LDs that I have seen. The 2.0 sound is accurately chosen; the original closing credits simply say ""Dolby Noise Reduction"": Dolby Digital 5.1, like any digital format, was certainly unknown in 1977. To those who have said that these are merely copies of the 1993 laser discs, I would point out that STAR WARS has the original title crawl, without the later-added ""Episode IV: A New Hope"": absolutely the first time we see it in any home video form, including the laser discs. On the other hand, some cleaning up of video speckling and anamorphic enhancement for 16x9 TVs would not have been difficult or costly these days; and the omission of special features present on the extra disc of the 2004 4-DVD set, like the ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary or any trailers, is disappointing. The original versions are packaged with Lucas' later revisions/remasterings (""Special Editions"") which few people need (and many don't want) but the combination does provide an immediate way to compare and contrast. If the raw form in which the original films are offered was Lucas' way of trying to bias people toward the more opulent, restored 2004 revisions, he has erred again and accomplished exactly the opposite: the theatrical versions win, hands down, even in a less sophisticated presentation. If, as Lucas says, the original elements are in too poor condition to fully restore the old versions and these are the best he is willing or able to give us, I am not too disappointed: indeed, were he to find good elements and restore them, doubtless he would start tampering all over again. At least these imperfect prints show no marks of intrusion. Moreover, the color timing for the 2004 revisions was dramatically altered and, because film fades with age, any changes made to the content of the extant old prints or negatives would be guesswork. I suspect that the theatrical versions in these sets are as accurate as they can be. As I said, some print damage might have been corrected and anamorphic enhancement could have been added (even some private from-LD versions have it), but these are small matters in the overall scheme of things.",1158105600,15,2746,5.010940919037199

I have a projection theater using a Panasonic front projector, and dvd quality is easily recognized.  I watched it last night, and the transfer quality is terrible.  Color and contrast are....peculiar.  The film looks worn out.  The 4:3 format resolution is terrible.  It almost looks like VHS.  When the ""new"" version was created, the old film was first digitally restored, to correct aging problems with the film stock, and then all of the new creatures and re-directing was done (Guido shoots first?).  I think that what most of us wanted, was a restored, but unaltered 16:9 anamorphic version.  This is not it.  On the other hand, the soundtrack and sound effects were original and great.

For those folks saying that 4:3 is somehow original, I have to ask, in what way?  The FILM in the THEATER had an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, not 4:3.  2.35:1 is ORIGINAL.  The best way of tranferring the original FILM THEATER version, over to a dvd is by using 16:9.  That uses more of the available dvd pixels for the movie image, which results in a much sharper picture.  As far as sound, we should get what was in the theater, which I believe was stereo.  I have already said that this stereo soundtrack sounds great, much better than a possible ping-pong style 5.1 treatment.

This means that if you already have the 2004 re-edited releases, with added computer graphics, you will be buying virtually the same thing just to get non-anamorphic transfers of the originals.

I say virtually the same thing because reportedly Lucas has made even more changes, so that there are now four versions of the films:  the originals, the 1997 Special Editions, the 2004 releases, and these.  The differences between the 2004 edition and this one are likely minor, so unless you're a completist, why bother?

And why should you care about ""anamorphic"" widescreen?  If you own a small, square TV set, you won't see the difference.  However if you have an HDTV (widescreen TV) the difference in picture quality is dramatic.  Lucas's decision not to remaster the originals is an even greater insult to Star Wars fans than not releasing them at all.  Most true-blue fans care very much about technical quality, and considering the devoted following these films have, they certainly deserve the same treatment accorded to ""The Godfather"", ""E.T."", and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", to name a few.

And I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan.  I'll stick with my laserdiscs if I ever want to see the original cuts, as there is no difference in picture quality.  Personally, I'm satisified with the 2004 DVDs as the changes are relatively minor and blindingly obvious.

LUCAS: The original negative is in too bad a shape to make a better copy.

VADER: If the original is in such bad condition, how did you make the 2004 edit version?

379199,5,6301773551,"I was five years old when the original Star Wars premiered. It is logical to assume that Star Wars was the genesis of my infatuation with movies in general. Star Wars was a rare treat for two distinct reasons: One, it was breath taking visually and two, it was stirring emotionally. It was one of those rare films that helped you believe that against all odds, anything is possible. I watched these films over and over as a kid, and I could probably recite the entire script word for word if I wanted to, but that would be embarrassing.

Then came the dark times, the Lucas Empire. Purists like myself watched in horror as the films that shaped our childhood dreams were gutted and re-made the way a desperate old man wanted them to be. I wish I knew why George sat on his a*s with the original trilogy for so long, if he had started on it right away, perhaps the need to remake the originals would not have been necessary.  Or, better yet, why not tell the story in order.

Enough bi*ching, on to the film. All the negative techno junky bi*ches can go to hell. The films on this DVD are shown exactly the way we remember them. Some have complained about picture flaws, sound issues and all that other sh$t. For me and I'm sure a few of you out there, the films few problems were some of its strengths. I don't need a film to be perfect; I need it to move me, to inspire me, to make me think. Today was the first time in a long time watching the original Star Wars that I felt happy, almost like a kid again. Maybe there is a little hope left in the universe sharing the adventures of a small group of heroes  a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...",1158019200,20,1655,4.211356466876971

The only drawback I see about this release other than some concern about widescreen issues and some quality concerns, is that the bonus disc that was included in 2004 edition is no longer offered with these new discs. I purchased the set this morning and have yet to watch the originals, but if you don't have the 2004 edition, then this is definately the ultimate edition available.",1158019200,8,657,4.672413793103448

One:  a true fan loves both versions and doesn't care if theese DVDs include the Special Edition.  It's irrelevant!

Two:  sound and visual enhancements require a lot of digital manipulation, which can sometimes diminish sound and picture quality.  If someone proclaims himself an expert, then Lucas should hire him, SO WE CAN BUY ANOTHER TRILOGY WITH BETTER PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY.

Three:  an artist's pride lies on its work not on its technological means.  Someone with a little bit of artistic critical sense should recognize that Lucas bases his work on a plot, not on technological means (laser disc, DVD, VHS, Beta, etc.) that only serve to deliver the story to thousands of people in the planet across time. What shall we care if Lucas today sells the Trilogy on VHS and tomorrow on laser disc, and the day after tomorrow on VISUAL LP?  Don't matter! We, true fans, we'll keep buying!

To make matters worse, the sound and picture are better on my bootleg copies from VHS than his shoddy ""bonus"".  Let's face it, the man has taken our childhood, twisted it into something sub par, and made it harder to watch than a 9/11 documentary and then, as an after thought, thrown the original back in our faces, using the latest technology to make it look like crap, so he can make us believe that he has done us a favor by destroying what we so dearly loved as children.",1158019200,21,884,4.281437125748503

Granted, they aren't as crystal clear as they could be, but they are far better than anything a VHS could produce.  You are only likely to notice much of a difference if you have a high definition television set with an expensive sound system.  Also, widescreen televisions may have some difficulty with the letterbox version as opposed to the anamorphic widescreen.  All in all, most of you will be happy to own the original Star Wars in its theatrical presentation.

The menu screens are fairly limited, and there is no real bonus material unless you have a strong desire to play the Star Wars Lego II demo on an Xbox.",1158019200,13,736,4.630769230769231
379245,1,6301773551,"All I ask for is a decent release of the original trilogy in its original form. Is that too much to ask? I just want it to represent the original theatrical release as close as possible. It is really quite reasonable and simple to do.

-Letterboxed anamorphic widescreen to conform to the original aspect ratio of the film(it was ""extra widescreen"").

-Transfer from the cleaned and restored negatives(I know you have 'em George! I'm pretty sure ILM restored the negatives BEFORE adding CG elements, not AFTER)

-Stereo sound is fine, since that is the format that it was originally released in. Just restore it if it is damaged.

-It would also be nice to have some old documentaries or extras, but not expected.

I was going to pick this DVD up until I looked at the back and read that it was in letterboxed 4:3. Lucas must have known that this would piss people off, yet he did it anyway. This makes me believe that he resents the fact that people enjoy the original version of the trilogy more than the ""improved"" versions. Well, I am tired of playing this game Mr. Lucas.  You know what the fans want, just give it to them!

I hate to say it, but it must be said- If the ""Special Editions"" are your ""original vision"", then maybe your original vision sucked. Maybe the fact that Star Wars turned out to be a classic (rather than an entertaining childrens Sci-Fi movie)was an accident....",1158019200,38,1391,4.562248995983936
379246,5,6301773551,"Normally when I review a film or book, I try to include a short summary about what the film is about. However, for STAR WARS I'm not going to do that. STAR WARS (and even though it is often marketed as A NEW HOPE, the film is called STAR WARS) is my favorite movie of all time. I saw the movie for the first time during one of the times it was initially re-released in the late 1970s. We were going to see one of the LOVE BUG pictures that were out at the time, but that was sold out so my family took me to see STAR WARS instead. I've been a fan ever since. That film helped form my interpretation and appreciation of movies, not to mention that it changed the entire film industry from how studios made movies all the way down to the way theatre owners showed films.

I didn't buy the STAR WARS DVD set that was released in 2004 because the original movies that I saw as a kid weren't a part of the set. Even though George Lucas practically swore that the original films would never see the light of day again, I knew better. I bided my time and it paid off. The original film is now contained on a second disc in this 2-disc release of STAR WARS. There are a lot of complaints about the sound and visual quality of the original film on this DVD. Personally, it doesn't bother me at all. I don't get as caught up with those things as a lot of people do, for instance high-definition television doesn't look all that different to me than regular television--it's a little brighter, but that's about all. What was important to me is that I finally have a DVD version of the original movie I saw when I was a kid, without the special editing and digital alterations of original actors. My only complaint is that it would have been nice if this edition included more extra features (just a commentary with George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, and some other people; DVD-ROM weblink; and a promo for the LEGO STAR WARS II video game). I realize that Lucas is storing that up for the ""ultimate"" STAR WARS DVD collection (rumored to me 8 or more discs) to be released around 2007-2009. To be honest, I probably won't buy that because I've already got the movies I wanted. It might not be a lot, but I'm satisfied.",1157932800,,2200,4.275779376498801
379247,1,6301773551,"So after waiting 11 years or so, we finally get a re-release of the original Star Wars film in all it's unaltered glory.  Just as fans have been dreaming about since the advent of DVD.

Well, um...I don't think any fan was dreaming about this particular release.

The original release version of Star Wars (the only reason to buy this set as most all fans will already have one of the previous Special Edition releases) is relegated to bonus material on disc two.  Ouch!  But wait, it gets worse.

George Lucas, the champion of pristine presentation in the theatre and at home has released the film that made him a legend in the state of the art of technology circa 1993.

Yes, that's right.  This transfer is from the laserdisc release of '93.  Even worse the film is not anamorphic like just about every other modern day DVD.  What does that mean?  Well a non-anamorphic DVD has a low visual clarity and the image won't fill a widescreen TV.  To make a movie anamorphic takes very little time and money.  That Star Wars is not anamorphic shows a disregard for the film that is troubling.

Star Wars fans expect these landmark films to be treated just like many other films (Vertigo, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, Snow White, etc.) that have gotten detailed restorations that cleaned up dirt, grime and audio ticks and presented the films in today's state of the art.  This is the release most fans were dreaming of.  A release that showed the film some modicrum of respect.

379250,1,6301773551,"Okay, I know that was a take on a classic Spaceballs line, but bear with me.  I have been a Star wars fan for years now and have bought damn near every incarnation of the ""holy trilogy.""  I bought the VHS versions, the VHS (NOW IN THX) versions, the VHS versions with the 10 minute preview of Episode II (which was nothing more than an interview of the younger versions of Owen and Beru...who were minor characters in the movie--at best), bootleg DVDs (ahem...VCDs) from some small country in Asia and now I am expected to shell out another $50-$60 for this?  Here are a few reasons why you should not buy these re-re-re-re-re-releases:

1)  All 6 will come out eventually in an ""Oh, my God, check this out, you're not gonna believe that we put all this junk into a super, special, deluxe, limited-time only edition"" set.  Just wait.

2)  The originals that people have been screaming for since the advent of DVD are only being released in Dolby 2.0.  Don't waste your time putting the movies into your surround sound system, just pop it in your PC and go!  You won't notice a difference.

3)  They don't come in a box.  What's the point of having a classic Trilogy like this if there's nothing to put it in?  Best Buy has a limited tin that you can buy all of the movies in.  Woo-hoo!  Instead of making it a limited tin, why not just put the movies into the tin or a box or something from the get go.  Why should we all go to Best Buy to get this tin?  That's not fair to us uber-geeks who need to spend money on Acne creme and girlie mags.

4)  They will probably be out on Blu-Ray next year anyway or the year after that.

Maybe this is all part of a plan by Lucasfilm to research what the best possible ultimate box set would be.  Does he:

1)  Put all 6 into a box set?

  If so, does he use the:

  a)  Originals

  b)  Special Editions

2)  Come out with a box set that has the Clone Wars animated series in it package in between episodes II and III?

3)  Come out with a box set that has the Clone Wars animated series in it as well as the two very poor live action Ewok movies?

4)  Come out with a box set that has the Clone Wars animated series in it as well as the two very poor live action Ewok movies as well as the animated Ewok adventures and Droids  animated film?

You get the point.  There are so many damn products out there from this franchise that the possibilities are endless.  The fact of the matter is that people shouldn't be asked to pay for the same material over and over again.  If you like doing that, just buy a Dave Matthews Band CD.",1157932800,19,2568,4.159509202453988
379251,4,6301773551,"First of all, I am just going to say that I am looking forward to purchasing these tomorrow and will at least have a decent looking DVD of the Origonal Versions, that should hold up better over time, rather than my CDR versions. I would give this 5 stars if it were not for the anamorphic/5.1 surround sound that he could have, and should have provided.

However, George Lucas has had more money than God for a long while now. I believe, no I actually am 110% POSITIVE that these are being released, again, and in this way, NOT FOR PROFIT. How much more money can he really be that desperate for!? It all comes down to one thing and greed has NOTHING to do with it.

He has just, plain and simple, lost his mind.

379252,3,6301773551,"I don't find the ""special editions"" nearly as objectionable as many do.  I don't like Greedo shooting first, but I can live with it; ""Jedi Rocks"" is nightmarish, but I never liked the scene it replaced, either; Hayden Christensen replacing Shaw bothers me far less after the success of Christensen's character in ROTS; Lucas was saying in the early '80s that he'd always wanted the scene of Jabba by the Falcon, but ran out of time, so he was fully justified in finally putting it in; many of the effects changes are improvements, though the faded lightsaber colors are a problem; the addition of McDiarmid's emperor to ESB is a huge improvement.

Still, I have certainly wanted a permanent copy of the unaltered originals.  They were an important part of my childhood, and I do want to have them as I first saw them.

Yes, it is unfortunate that these discs are not anamorphic.  That costs them a star in my review.  Yes, it's irritating that they are making us repurchase the 2004 DVDs, instead of boxing all three originals together at a lower price.  That costs another star.

But I have become incredibly fed-up with the endless rants here and elsewhere on the net that these discs are just ""copied from the old laserdiscs"" -- as if Lucasfilm is simply issuing the same LD-ripped bootlegs that have been circulating for years.

These DVDs are created from the original 1993, THX LD MASTERS, NOT from the LDs themselves... and that's why they are worth buying.  I own the LDs, and the picture is badly affected by the limitations of the LD format itself: grainy, flickery, washed-out.  DVDs will do a much better job capturing the full quality of the 1993 masters.  No, it will not look as good as a new, remastered anamorphic DVD, and that's too bad.  But it will look a whole lot better than the VHS tapes many reviewers are defiantly declaring they prefer, or the LDs, or DVD-Rs from the LDs, or any home version of the original versions ever issued.  Even zoomed-in on a 16:9 TV they will look quite respectable -- not as good as one might like, but respectable.

These discs aren't perfect, but they are perfectly acceptable... and they're likely to be the best we get.  Many reviewers have predicted that Lucas will soon put out the anamorphic versions they demand, and that everyone should boycott these discs and wait.  But Lucas is very unlikely to do that.  He has refused for years to revisit the original negatives (he even claims they no longer exist) or put any money into restoration.  Lucasfilm finally decided to meet the fan demand partway, by digging up the last, best version of the originals -- the LD master -- and putting it on DVD.  It was easy for them to do that.  To make new versions would cost time, money and effort, and Lucas isn't going to do it.  If they sell well, I'd expect that these non-anamorphic discs will probably reappear after their ""limited"" 4 month release, but don't hold your breath for anything else.

For films as important as ""Star Wars"" to be presented in such a lackluster, poorly produced fashion is, at the risk of sounding melodramatic, an outrage.

Here's my opinion:  Star Wars is many things, but one of the most basic things it is is an ""epic"" story (a work of literature, if you prefer) involving the character development of its main characters over time. Hans Solo starts out as a ""what's in it for me"" smuggler, with no conception of working for a greater good and with no hesitation to kill. Over the course of the trilogy, he transforms his character into a willing participant in the rebellion for the right (""honorable"") reasons, not just for the joy of killing the enemy. If Hans doesn't shoot Greedo first when we first meet him, there is no transformation to take note of.  It's called character development, people.  It's what creates a good bit of the story-value.

Nobody wants ""weesa fwee.""  No rational person would  replace Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christianson.  And nobody wants Bobba Fett with a Kiwi accent. This is what we fight against and boycott.  The most poorly rendered computer creature ever conceived waiting for Han beneath the Falcon is not an improvement or an ""enhancment,"" and certainly not a welcome or worthy addition to great films.

""It's just the original versions, as they were,"" Lucas said. ""We didn't do anything to it at all. But we're not sure how many people want that.""

""Now we'll find out whether they really wanted the original or whether they wanted the improved versions,"" he said. ""It'll all come out in the end.""

The original theater release would have been in at least 5.1 surround sound.  This DVD is only in stereo so that Lucas didn't have to spend any more money than it takes to burn a DVD directly off a laser disc.  People have been doing that for about a decade now and they have better cover art, extras, and a lower price.

We don't want improvements like replacing actors and the spoken rolls of others.  That is mindless meddling not improving.  We want a proper picture in widescreen and surround sound.  We want the kind of product one would expect from THX and Skywalker Sound.  This is the ""Bedazzled"" devil wish granting of DVD releases.  Even if George Lucas doesn't care about these Star Wars films there are those who do.  If Lucas is going to release a DVD appeasing, or testing the fans at least make it something worth buying.

It's almost like George is trying to fool us into believing that the original versions are crap. If he dresses them up badly enough maybe we'll believe in his new found 'vision.'

Only a true artist has the moral courage to focus on achieving his/her own vision of perfection instead of paying too much attention to what the rabble is clamouring for.  This is a rather elitist viewpoint, but true art is inherently elitist anyway.  If you fans want to think of Star Wars, especially the original trilogy, as a piece of art that is above the usual American pop culture garage, then show more respect to Lucas' artistic drive and his intellectual property rights.

For me this is about being able to finally put to bed my laser disc player. I have a 9-disc set of the original trilogy in it's original condition, but my antique laser disc player won't easily interface with my modern TV. Now I can put the player in the attic and be done with it.

As for next year's inevitable re-release of the trilogy in yet another once-in-a-lifetime format, that's a given. It's not just Lucasfilm doing that - half of the movies on the DVD release list are actually re-releases. They send out a second disc with special features and call it a new version.

There are a few dust/dirt spots on some of the image, particularly some of Peter Cushing's scenes aboard the Death Star, but nothing too distracting. The sound is solid, probably what it sounded like in 1977 (good stereo, but no surround-sound available.) Also, the opening ""crawl"" only says ""Star Wars."" No ""Star Wars - Episode IV: A  New Hope."" That finally puts an end to the argument that the original 1977 prints contained ""A New Hope."" (They did NOT, otherwise all of the toys, lunchboxes, figures and comic books from 1978-1979 would have included ""A New Hope"" in their titles.) There are a couple tie-fighter scenes where the transparent ""border boxes"" are seen around the model ships,  but only in a handful of scenes. Most of the ships and space battles look really good. Again, these 1977 flaws are not distracting. There is a minor ""click"" sound as the DVD disc layer switches, immediately after Cushing says ""Terminate her. Immediately."" Thankfully, the film looks the way it originally did. (Yes, the not-so-great airbrushing job seen below Luke's ""floating"" landspeeder, but you don't get the silly explosion rings seen in the 2004 edition when planets explode.)

One of the best films ever. Overall, the image is clear and lively, although a few visual flaws exist here and there. Again, the blemishes aren't too distracting, although I don't have a digital TV. I do have a very large RCA TV, and the image is pretty impressive. They could have added more bonuses on the disc though, instead of just the trailer for the Star Wars Lego videogame. Screen tests, anyone? The retro artwork on the back of the DVD case and the inside insert (which should have more information and photos) is pretty cool, reminiscent of the 1977 and 1978 theatrical posters that decorated movie lobbies. Get it if you must own the original theatrical version -- this is the one I've been waiting for, where Tatooine looks desolate and alien, not the overrpopulated scenes in the ""Special Edition"" where Mos Eisley looks like Dallas, Texas, in rush-hour traffic.  But if you're happy with George Lucas' recent ""Special Edition"" releases, it's probably not worth $20 to those who like Lucas' recent ""changes."" Oh, and yes, Han Solo shoots first in this orignial theatrical DVD.

379361,3,6301773551,"For those of you complaning about George Lucas and this 3rd release of Star Wars on DVD, you need to get your facts straight.

1. It was NOT Lucas's idea to release the original theatrical cut of the movie. Lucas has stated several times that he would never release the versions of the film on DVD because he considered them unfinished works. This release was spearheaded by his company, Lucasfilm.

2. Because Lucas didn't want this release, he refused to have money spent remastering the original films for anamorphic widescreen. He even went so far as to claim than no original prints of the film existed, but this is not true. That's why Lucasfilm was forced to use the version they have. It's also why we probably never will see a remastered copy of this release.

3. Lucas insisted that the DVD's include the 2004 versions of the film. This is so that any sales of these DVD's will boost the total money earned by these versions even further. This way Lucas can conviently ignore the fact that most people are buying this for the original versions.

So if your're gonna condem George Lucas for something, condem him for the right thing. It's not his fault some of you have to buy another DVD set, but it is his fault your not getting the best quality version of the film. Now, if you haven't bothered picking up the DVD sets before now, then this is a good release to get. Still, there probably will be a box set of all 6 movies at some point in the future, but wether or not it will contain the original theatrical versions is uncertain at this time.",1157328000,18,1557,4.471830985915493

As a previous reviewer had already stated, with the trilogy already available on DVD and these upcoming releases due out soon, it won't be too long before another set is released containing all six films, with the original trilogy in anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1.  You know it will happen, and you know that these editions are NOT worth picking up.  If you already own the first release of the films on DVD, don't be duped again, and if you don't, don't pick any of these films up.

The picture, for the original version, has a slight, but almost ever present, veil of grain to it (probably the result of trying to up convert the Laserdisc masters, that is supposedly the source being used, to the DVD format) as well, the colour balance is tilted slightly to the red spectrum, making people look like they have bad sunburns at times.

Also, STAR WARS and EMPIRE original version disc's cover art seem to have been conceived by a different person then that of JEDI, because you get these crappy art montages for STAR WARS and EMPIRE, but for JEDI, they use an alternate poster art, which is what they should have done with all of the discs, seeing as the original poster art is saved for the newer recut version discs (which is the same tired disc that Lucas has been trying to cram down our throats for years now, ever since his newer trilogy made it necessary to go back to the original films, and change things to reflect his newer version of events from the past... Confused yet?)

Is it worth the money to buy these new discs, well that depends on just what kind of STAR WARS fan you are, if you can stomach the changes to the films that Lucas has made, and already own the first incarnate of the DVD's, then probably not, but if you're tired of bootlegs with questionable picture quality, and can get past the grainy picture of the new, original version DVD's, then it's a no brainer...",1157241600,8,1859,4.494082840236686

379395,1,6301773551,"Anamorphic refers to a technical process for mastering a widescreen film to DVD. It has NOTHING to do with the age of a film or with digitally altering a film. Google it and read up so you understand why people are upset. The VIDEO TRANSFER is the issue, not the actual content of the film.

People don't understand about film to video transfers. Films (even films that are 75 years old) have a higher resolution than even HD video. That is just the way it is no matter the age of the film. That's why a good transfer of the Wizard of Oz can  look stunning 67 years later. Video has been trying to catch up to film resolution for years, that is what HD is all about.

A film to video transfer done in 1993 used 1993 video technology, which was not nearly as good as current HD technology and WAY below the resolution of film. Films to video transfers today are very close to capturing the full resolution of film.

Because they are shot on film, the Star Wars films have ALWAYS had full film resolution, even in 1977. Fans want to see them as they were in the theater, in high resolution and which a 1993, non-anamorphic video transfer CANNOT provide.

So this release DOES NOT reflect how the films really looked when they were released. It reflects how home video looked in 1993, not film. Couple that with non-anamorphic transfers (which results in a 15-20% LOSS of picture detail to the black bars) and you have a VERY substandard release.

A new transfer of the original films (with NO digital tweaking, just a direct film to video transfer) could EASILY have been done to provide a crystal clear, HD level DVD release. This is what is done with even the most mediocre DVD releases. You can get an anamorphic, HD level transfer of Gigli for crying out loud.

As for the sound issue, all 3 films were originally released with 6 track Dolby Surround, which can easily be transferred to a Dolby Digital 5.1 track. It's done all the time.

So before you judge, understand the real technical issues here. Lucasfilm is purposely releasing low quality, sub standard video transfers of these classic films. I can't tell you WHY, but they are.",1157155200,4,2139,4.523316062176166

The prequel trilogy is much maligned but should not be so hated. Yes, The Phantom Menace is garbage, but the other two are passable, even fun genre-films.

The point of the matter is that we all know that George Lucas is not primarily a filmmaker, he is instead a businessman. He put together a business model for success, milking his beloved Star Wars for all it's worth for three decades now! His children will continue his revolting capitalist legacy and so will their children. It's up to you, dear consumer, to put an end to his diabolical, imperialistic machinations that have sucked money from your pocket for years on end. Be wise like Yoda, don't buy anymore George Lucas product until he realizes that consumers should be treated with some respect at the very least. It's true that humanity is made up of not people, but ""sheeple"" and that the stupid masses will continually be enslaved if they do not think for themselves. Wasn't that one of the primary ideas behind the Star Wars films? George Lucas will forever play tricks on the minds of the weak, using his ""force"" to extract a few dollars from their pockets.

I say forget Star Wars! You love movies? Type in Criterion Collection into the amazon search engine and see the wide world of cinema available at your fingertips. Go rent some of those films and stop sending big paychecks to the Sith Lord Lucas.

This latest ploy of releasing the originals on DVD in their original versions is another in the long line of schemes that Lucas has been slowly plotting. Soon there will be more and more DVDs, HD-DVDs, Blu-Ray discs, 3D cinematic releases and special, special, special editions.

Like most other fans, I was ecstatic that the original trilogy was finally being released on DVD, albeit with the special editions.  George Lucas had a grand opportunity to please ALL Star Wars fans by offering both the SE and original theatrical versions on DVD, and allowing the fans to decide which they would like to own.  Why he passed that chance, I will never know, but I don't pretend to know and understand the ins-and-outs of DVD distribution.

If (no...WHEN) Lucas decides to remaster both the audio and the video for Eps IV-VI, and leave them as the original theatrical versions, I will consider purchasing them.

""These are great flicks (I was born in 1971, so Star Wars was my life!), and I will buy the DVD, but I anticipate shelling out another 100 bucks in a couple of years when you issue the super expanded version which contains the directors edit as well as the original theatrical version (ala ""Aliens"") """,1156723200,2,380,4.277777777777778

I don't care if it is not mixed in 5.1 surround, that didn't exist in 1977. THIS is the version I fell in love with back then, and this is the version I want to see again. No alterations, no 'improvements', no extras. Just the original cinematic release as I first experienced it. I don't even want to see that clumsy banner 'Episode IV - A New Hope'. Just Star Wars, as it was in 1977.

A naive young metaphor intercepts a secret message from a space terrorist and sets off on a mission to free his galaxy from the Republican Party, gaining help along the way from every Hollywood cliche in the books. Produced for the absurdly-astronomical sum of 11 million dollars Star Wars changed the course of cinematic history and doomed us all to twenty years of science fiction that is not really science fiction. Thirty years later the pond still ripples, and a new generation of filmmakers exists that are not only influenced by the film, they grew up with it.

One of the things I remember most vividly about the first screenings of the film was the incredibly subtle colour, something Lucas and his minions seem to have forgotten in recent digital restorations. Hopefully the masters used this time around (allegedly the Laserdisc releases) produce better results.",1156291200,15,1388,4.615384615384615
379458,3,6301773551,"After reading countless reviews about these Star Wars DVD's over the past few months here on Amazon from some who are taking this issue way too seriously to others who just don't seem to have a clue as to what some words mean, I finally feel compelled enough to write a review of my own.

To begin, I agree with the majority of reviewers in the fact that these films, the original unaltered Star Wars trilogy, deserve much better treatment for release on DVD.  Now, from what I understand, the original negatives/prints were destroyed or altered during the restoration for the Special Edition release back in 1997 and, as a result, can't be restored.  Therefore, the laserdisc transfers from 1993 are being used as source material for the upcoming DVD release, which explains why these ""bonus"" DVD's (don't get me started on the originals only being - according to the soulless marketing geniuses at LucasFilm - ""bonus"" discs),  won't be anamorphic and without 5.1 surround sound.  I also understand that LucasFilm is not willing to put in as much time, effort, or money into this project since the original unaltered films didn't represent his true ""vision"" for the films.  However, I take issue with the reasoning behind this thought process.

First of all, I'll admit I'm no film restoration expert, but common sense would tell me that 95% of the restoration of the original unaltered trilogy has already been done since only, at the very most, 5% of the original movies was altered for the Special Edition releases.  And if all the negatives from the originals were, in fact, destroyed (which I highly doubt unless George Lucas cut them up and set them ablaze late one night during a fit of artistic rage), all one would have to do is find some copied negatives/prints that were used in the theaters when the movies originally came out (perhaps from a private collector if LucasFilm doesn't have any which, again, I highly doubt) and restore just the 5% of scenes that were changed or removed completely from the newer versions with better picture quality and 5.1 surround sound instead of re-restoring the entire original movies.  As a result, the excuse of not wanting to put the time, effort, and money into this project doesn't really make much sense since they would only have to restore just a few scenes here and there, even if those scenes weren't taken from the original negatives.  Also, keep in mind these are the same people behind THX, so LucasFilm releasing a half-hearted attempt of a DVD release is hypocritical of a company who prides itself on industry-setting high-standard video and audio quality.

As for the ""anamorphic"" situation, I think the meaning of the word ""anamorphic"" first needs to be explained.  In simplest terms, a DVD in anamorphic widescreen format means the video contained in the DVD will take up the entire screen on a widescreen TV without having to zoom in and, in turn, no black letterbox bars will show (at least they won't if the movie was shot in 16:9 widescreen; Star Wars, on the other hand, was shot in ""extra-widescreen"" so the black letterbox bars will still appear on the top and bottom of a 16:9 widescreen TV, but roughly only half as much as they would on a standard 4:3 TV - the image will still fill the screen from side-to-side).  Now, if you don't own a widescreen TV, this isn't a major issue since you will see the letterbox bars regardless if you're watching a widescreen-version DVD on a standard 4:3 TV.  However, if you're like me and do happen to own a widescreen TV, there is nothing more frustrating than buying a DVD only to find out it isn't anamorphic when you start to play it, which defeats the whole purpose of owning a widescreen TV if the DVD you'd like to watch will not only show the letterbox bars on top, but on the sides as well.  And zooming in to enlarge the picture and rid the bars doesn't help much either because whenever you zoom in on something, whether it be a DVD or a picture on a computer, you lose picture quality which again defeats the purpose of a owning a DVD in the first place.  So for you reviewers out there who think some people are overreacting because these DVD's won't be anamorphic, you obviously don't own a widescreen TV and don't know what words mean.

Now for the fans who are taking this situation way too seriously, just take a deep breath and relax.  Don't get me wrong, I'm as big a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, especially ""The Empire Strikes Back"", as much as anyone and would like to see the original movies get the proper respect and treatment they deserve (even if only for preservation's sake).  But keep in mind these are just movies meant to entertain - not cure the world of cancer.  And even if the new computer-generated footage added in the Special Edition versions already released on DVD takes away from the original trilogy (which it does, especially that new Max Rebo Band song in Return of the Jedi - who was the genius that came up with that?) they are, like I mentioned, practically 95% visually the same and 99.9% the same story-wise as the originals and are anamorphic with 5.1 surround sound.  And if not having Han shooting first or having the original ""Star Wars"" opening crawl from '77 makes you lay awake at night (the addition of ""Episode IV - A New Hope"" actually does improve the film from a storyline standpoint if you think about), I truly do feel sorry for you (even though I agree Han should be shooting first, which accounts for that extra 0.1%).

I could also get into how the original trilogy, even the Special Editions, is far superior to the blue screen-themed new trilogy by leaps and bounds (keep in mind George Lucas didn't write or direct ""Empire"" or ""Jedi"" and wasn't surrounded by ""yes men"" back then), but then I'd really ramble on and this review would be five times longer than it already is now.

Hopefully, one day in a galaxy far, far away (boy was that clever), George Lucas will put his ego aside, or at least follow a masterful yet soulless marketing plan, and give the cinematically-outstanding originals he created the proper respect and DVD treatment they deserve.  But until then, I (along with almost every other reviewer here on Amazon - admit it) will probably end up buying these half-hearted DVD's just so I can say I've got the originals on DVD, even though these DVD's will probably only be slightly better than the widescreen VHS tapes I bought back in '95.  In the meantime, though, I'll have to admit it is kind of entertaining to watch the real-life transformation of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader back to Anakin Skywalker in the form of one George Lucas.

Note:  According to ""The Rumor Mill"" over at The Digital Bits website from 8/24/2006, it has been confirmed that LucasFilm will be releasing an ""ultimate, 6-film Star Wars anniversary boxed set planned for 2007"" with even more changes to the films (supposedly one change is the puppet Yoda from Episode I is now going to be a CG version like what was used in Episodes II and III), as well as more special features and deleted scenes.  It is unknown if restored versions of the original trilogy will be included, but keep this in mind if you plan to purchase these DVD's.",1156204800,289,7225,4.649921507064364
379459,5,6301773551,"Well finally George Lucas is releasing the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL Star Wars trilogy on DVD!!! These movies are not high definitions and do not have 5.1 surround sound, but that IS how they were released in the 1970's and early 1980's in theatres! Technology was a lot simpler then! Ideally it would be great if they were in surround sound and in high definition, but this is a much more AUTHENTIC version.

I HATE the awful additions that George Lucas made to these movies in the 1990's. GREEDO SHOOTS FIRST! Why does Han Solo say to Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars IV A New Hope  ""Jabba you are a wonderful HUMAN BEING?!!!!"" (when Han and Jabba meet by his Millenium Falcon)  This 1990's addition doesn't even make sense as he is NOT human??!!! Not to mention the terrible effect of Han Solo walking around Jabba and standing on his tail, which looks very fake and is badly rendered and edited. A real hatchet job!

FINALLY THE ORIGINAL MOVIES AS I REMEMBER SEEING THEM AT THE THEATRES, THANK YOU!!!  GET OVER IT NERDS!

The original movies were great! Han Solo was a great character. Darth Vader and The Emperor were evil. They had ground breaking special effects, fun, adventure, great characters, great actors and chemistry between them, great stories, good humour, and interesting themes (spritual- The Force,  empowering- rebels taking on an evil empire, and self belief, but to name a few), and a speedy pace, unlike the newer trilogy (1-3) which were incredibly slow, badly acted, were boring political stories, badly directed, contained unbelievably cringeworthy terrible dialogue, had boring characters - Qui-Gon Jinn etc,  awful characters- Ja Ja Binks, were oversaturated with meaningless special effects, and completely uninspiring.",1156118400,19,1738,5.010416666666667

Well, now they are, except they're releasing them with the 2004 re-cuts that I, along with many others, already have. This is just a poor business decision. Remember back in 1997 when they rereleased these movies in theatres as ""Special Editions"" with new scenes, sound, and FX? Technically, there are three versions of each film: The original, 1997, and 2004. All they had to do was couple the originals with the 1997 special editions, then we would have all three versions to compare and contrast. That's it.

Remember Michael Jordan retired 3 times, so don't believe Lucas is going stop when he says it's over.

The next version will most likely be made for HD TV and the HD DVD. This is what will make every Star Wars fan crash into the stores for a copy of a Star Wars Episodes 1-6 Collection on High Definition. It's no joke, HD DVD is amazing when viewed on HD DVD Players. Like DVD's replaced VHS, HD DVD will replace your standard DVD's. Lucas knows this. Sure you can play your standard DVD's on the HD DVD Players but it's not the same. Just watch, soon Lucas will announce his release date for the HD versions, and every fan of the movie will need to have it. I'm just hoping he realizes how much money he could make if he decided to do Episodes 7, 8, and 9. Last time I checked, Lucas was worth over $3 Billion. Why not be worth another several billion??

379506,3,6301773551,"I remember seeing the ""Special Edition"" of A New Hope in the theaters nearly a decade ago. While I was blown away with seeing a Star Wars film on the big screen, much of the ""special"" material left me with mixed emotions. Then came the rest of the films and by the time I got to the musical scene in Jabba's Palace I was simply depressed. Then came episodes I-III and I slowly began to stop caring at all.

The last and only version of Star Wars I bought (and still own) was the VHS boxed set of the original films. So, while I can understand the rage of everyone who has bought a half-dozen versions of these films in the last ten years, I haven't fallen into that particular money pit. I simply preferred to do without the films if they had to be the special editions. I stuck to my dusty VHS tapes.

Lucas is clearly out to make as much money as possible from the franchise. That was obvious to me from the moment I left the theater after Episode I. So, I've patiently waited for the originals, flaws and all, to make their way back on the shelves. Now they have and I'll probably pick them up. Though, I can assure you it's only for the ""bonus features"" (i.e. the theatrical releases). The fact that it's weighted down with the ""Special Editions"" and the damage is done to my psyche, those VHS tapes are getting pretty fragile.

Now, on September 12, I'll be able to buy the original versions from the Trilogy the way they were intended to be watched!",1154995200,8,397,4.549295774647887
379509,1,6301773551,"A long time ago, in an era far far away, a young, relatively unexperienced director had a vision. In his mind he saw spaceships, an unknown galaxy and broad characters. He wanted to make this vision come true, so he summoned a group of brilliant craftsmen, artists and actors. The rest is history.

Basically, there are two issues with this ""new"" DVD Set that have to be talked about. First, the lacking respect for what has to be the most influential film of the past 50 years, and secondly the purely commercially- driven release- mania of George Lucas.

I completely agree with an earlier reviewer who wrote that without his excellent matte artists, model makers, sound designers, helping writers and so on, George Lucas would have had nothing, and we would probably don't have many other now classic films.

Without his team, Lucas would still be a 2nd grade director, running around sets yelling only ""faster"" or ""more intense"". Granted, he had the vision, but others made it a reality. Face it, Star Wars wasn't carried by dialogue or story. It was the extraordinary environment, the characters, the actors and the music.

The proof of that is the prequel trilogy. There, George Lucas did have complete control over everything, and he just couldn't handle it, he was not even close.

But his incredible heritage remains. And he just owes it to those brilliant people, who made Star Wars what it became, to cherish these original films and preserve them for future generations because they were indeed the fundament for today's movie industry.

That Lucas treats these originals like crap is just arrogance and lacking respect for fans. It's that simple because there's absolutely no sane reason to do what he does.

And what is George Lucas' opinion? ""I'm sorry you fell in love with an unfinished film.""

Consequently, he ""fixed"" the original trilogy by adding in all kinds of modern CGI things. But there's a fundamental mistake in his way of thinking. He thinks the effects are imperfect, so the whole film is. He says these movies are imperfect, but all he does is replace the effects. What George Lucas really doesn't get is this: the films WERE perfect because effects, actors and story (although very melodramatic) formed a unity. And the effects WERE perfect for 1977 stadards. Even more than that.

And Star Wars IS a 1977 film and NOT a 2004 movie.

Now, it would be perfectly fine to release these revised editions *once*.

But how many times did these things come out already? And every time with a new ""feature"", but the movies stay the same. And you don't know whether to buy it or not because you don't know whether the latest version will be the last. And don't tell me Lucasfilm doesn't know this, they are fully aware of it.

But you know what? The line has finally been crossed. I think not even the most fierce Star Wars fan will ever buy a DVD again without severe doubts.

Many fans defend this shameless charade by saying that other blockbusters also have different DVD Editions.

Of course they do, but isn't the difference flamingly obvious? When, for instance, Spider- Man, Batman, Chronicles Of Narnia, King Kong or Lord of the Rings are being released as DVDs, these individual DVD Editions are relased either *simultaneously* or the customer is fully aware that a Special Edition will follow soon. People can CHOOSE which one to buy. With those never- ending re- releases of the SAME films, you can never choose between buying or not because you never know whether a Special Special Special Edition with ""all- new features"" is already planned.

Often I read reviews that moan: if you don't like it, then don't buy it and stop complaining! Yes, well, we are not complaining about people actually buying this rehash, we condemn the product itself and the motivations behind it.

Don't let Lucas fool you! Next year we can celebrate the 30th anniversary of ""Star Wars"", and no one can honestly believe Lucas doesn't have concrete plans.

Another reviewer said it best: by releasing such a DVD set and by his behaviour, George Lucas spits in the face of movie history and everyone who learned to love it.",1154563200,2,4135,4.785112359550562
379510,1,6301773551,"I've been a fan of Star Wars since as far back as I can remember. I'd have to say It was the first movie that opened my imagination to endless possibilities. I must have drawn thousands of Star Wars related pictures over the years and still watch the movies when I'm in a creative rut. I think what I found most interesting about the film, in my later years, is how it all came together. by all accounts this movie should have been a disaster, but because of the efforts of a group of young filmmakers, Star Wars went on to become the biggest movie franchise of all time. If it hadn't been for make-up artists, matt artist, model makers, sound editors, camera techs, graphic artists and wardrobe designers, George Lucas would be a 3rd rate director and we would never get to see anything else he produced. No Indiana Jones, no Empire, nothing. So you think that a film like this would be treated wih the upmost respect when released on DVD. Uh, no. Instead we get a DVD copy of Laserdiscs that are 13 years old. How's that for gratitude.

Now I understand that in the 1970's there were alot of limitations in how you could achieve certain special effects. But you know who changed that? Industrial Light & Magic. I belived in what I saw on the screen as a kid and as an adult still get chills up my spine when I see this film. It is a testament of the hard work of the people behind it. Don't honor the work they did by releasing a sub-par version of this movie. Spend a little money to gather original prints together and restore this film to the greatness it deserves. Don't do it to make a buck. Don't do it to appease fanboys who write hate mail. Do it because without it you would have nothing George Lucas.

each film would come in a 2 or (more likely) 3 disc set including

--the original, untouched versions of the films, including even the original fox searchlight opening.

--the most incredible image transfer possible, in whatever disc and tv screen formats are available at that time

--careful, excellent original sound transfer, in various audio formats

--commentaries plural, not just one commentary split among too many key players.  one for the director, one for actors, one for effects/sound/editing...

--trailers and sheets

--for episode 4, a full cd-rom version of all of lucas's original script ideas, the stuff no studio was interested in, the stuff he thought up before he ever tried to bring it to the studios, all the arcane terminology and plot elements/characters/planets we saw and the ones we never knew he had imagined, the ones he abandoned, the ones he wanted but couldn't do....all of it.

--for the sequels, a full accounting of lucas's original ideas, the studio's ideas, what was cut, what added, what was floated but abandoned...

--a special feature on conceptual artwork, lucas's first vision of the movies' environments, machinery, gear, clothing versus final vision, rejected/evolving artwork, etc

--extensive storyboards, including things that made it into the film, things that didn't, things floated but abandoned--and done like the recent criterion editions of kurosawa films, which appear as movie presentations.

--every available deleted scene, period.  do it as a branching dvd option, or a set of unconnected scenes, but show us.  no more lingering rumors.  get it all out.

--much fuller presentations of the special effects process, including the features available on the first laserdisc sets, which seem to have a much more extended offering of that, including the trial scenes shot with x-wings hand-held on wands to rough-in what the death-star finale would look like.  pursue the effects exploration right into how the final visuals were created, and be thorough.

--the 2 1/2 hour 4th-disc making-of documentary that came with the trilogy dvds is really excellent.  so now do 2 1/2 hours on each film.  a good documentary could avoid overlapping the stuff above except for a few necessary minutes total.  cover casting (who was chosen, who not, screen tests, etc), influence on culture, box-office, satires, hitches, on-set footage, planning, filming, etc.

lucas and co, you know this stuff better than we do, which is why we keep buying the same movies over and over.  just do a once-and-for-all definitive edition, and i'm on board.  but do it earnestly, in a way that comes as close to clearing the rumors and archives as absolutely possible.  don't make it necessary to have 6 iterations in our libraries to get a complete picture.  if you want to make more money, make more films.  if episodes 7-9 never existed, as you've been recently insisting, well hell, make them up anyway and have at it.  but please, no more half-hearted, faucet-drip dvd releases of what your movies and your fans really deserve.

because even if i/we fall for these september 2006 releases, your legacy is becoming one of marketing instead of filmmaking--not more than, but instead of.

until the real deal comes out, i own the final vhs widescreen release of the original films (complete with the seizure-inducing visible copy-protection oscillating screen!), so maybe i can wait until 2027, especially when ridley scott is going to be keeping me busy with 3 editions of a dvd blade runner.",1153958400,33,4845,4.915024630541872
379543,1,6301773551,"Or anything else Star Wars for that matter.

It's time to show George that he no longer rules the universe as he once did.  And the only way to do that is to hit him where he'll actually notice, his pocket book.  He obviously doesn't listen to anything or anyone else.

Why shouldn't you buy these Original Trilogy (OT) DVDs?

First, the movies won't be anamorphic.  To quote Bill Hunt of The Digital Bits web site, ""Anamorphic enhancement is the widely accepted industry standard for the presentation of widescreen films on DVD"".  Is it really that bad that the movies won't be anamorphic, well not really, but it's symptomatic of the reasons for George releasing these movies.  He's only doing it because he's feeling forced to do, but he's not going to be nice about it, so no anamorphic print.  Very lame.  And besides, that process really doesn't cost all that much to begin with.

Second, according to George these movies will be from the best source material available, baloney.  They are from the Laserdisc masters, which for the time, were great.  But compared to today's movies they are sub-par.  Lucasfilm says there are no longer any valid ""source material"" copies of the OT because he had them all destroyed when they release the ""Special Edition"" version.  Again baloney.  Many copies of the original movies do exist in private collections, film history archives and other places that he cannot destroy.  Anyone of these could be used to create an true cleaned up OT version.  I still have my copy of the Star Wars: The Definitive Collection release and it's an okay print, but with a little cleaning up it could be fantastic.

Third, he says he doesn't want to allocate the resources to the cleanup.  Fine.  There are any number of studios who have said they would get better copies of the prints (even the source for the LD prints would be fine) and clean them up and make them anamorphic for no charge.  They just want to be associated with the project.

Yes, they're his movies and he has the right to make changes (whether you agree or not with the changes) as he sees fit.  And while I don't like the changes he's made (especially in Star Wars which, in my opinion, were atrocious) I am willing to let the director do what he fells is best for his movies and support or not support these changes by purchasing or not purchasing the updated versions.  There will always be arguments about the validity of ""Director's Cuts"" (think Blade Runner and Brazil) but the simple answer is they are ""Director's Cuts"" and they can do what they want with ""their"" movies.  According to Lucas, the ""Special Edition"" version is the true vision that he had for the movies.  If that is truly the case George, why the waffling on the different OT versions.  Go with one and stick with it.  Period.  This so-called acquiescence to the fans to release the original movies has been downright insulting, condescending and not worthy of a studio as great as Lucasfilm is (or has been in the past).

And the final reason to not buy these movies is simple:  George says he is releasing them to, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""appease the fans"".  Bull@#$!  He's releasing them for one simple reason.  Money.  Think about it.  Every time something new for Star Wars has come out, he's released some version on DVD.  He's planning on releasing a super-duper box set of all the movies in a couple of years as well as the HD-DVD versions, what kind of teasers is he going to release between now and then.  He knows he can release anything with the words Star Wars on them and we'll buy them.

Well not anymore for this consumer.  I've given ol' George the last dime I ever will.  In fact, I'm boxing up my ""Special Edition"" version of the OT on DVD and sending them back to George with this note.  I have the Laserdisc editions and while dated in their look and feel, they are truly the ""original trilogy"".  I might even send back all three prequel DVDs as well just to prove the point.",1153872000,31,3972,4.573049645390071
379544,5,6301773551,"You know what? I'm glad these are coming out, I know what anamorphic is and I could care less that these aren't anamorphic. You know why? Cause I didn't buy a single version of these films past the deluxe ""letterbox"" boxed set, as it was first called, VHS tapes, I never even bought the first version of the Special Editions. You know why? because I heard about DVD players coming around soon, then when he wouldn't release the orginals I just decided I was OK with that I'd just wait him out, knowing folks would complain, myself included, untill he did.

And now I can get the new edits and the original films and even if it isn't anamorphic (I have a LCD widescreen tv by the way) I don't care becuase I never wasted all the money so many others and just remained patient.

Thanks George, this set is good enough for me!",1153699200,13,823,4.337662337662338

I agree with another reviewer that I prefer the old Ewok song at the end of ROTJ and the smaller celebration at Endor.

I look forward to being able to finally add these to my SW collection.  To be able to plug some authentic releases in and sit back and get nostalgic.  To watch it with out my child hood memories being interupted by injected ""continuity"".  All i can say is the bloopers better still be there ;)

It's really disappointing that they are non-anamorphic and since it seems to be inevitable that they will be re-released at some point with anamorphic transfers despite the fact that Lucas says otherwise.  If I was still using a standard television set for my primary device to view DVDs, this would be fine for now I suppose, but having just purchased a widescreen television in January, non-anamorphic DVDs are not attractive to me at all.

So a warning to all, if you don't know the difference between anamorphic and non-anamorphic DVDs and unless you don't mind buying these again to get anamorphic transfers in the future, I suggest you go do a search on the web to see for yourself what the difference is so that you can make a more informed purchase.",1153008000,32,891,4.55625

So what's the big deal if Lucas jumps on the bandwagon?

I only own one Star Wars DVD (Episode III) and that's because I spent a gift certificate on it. I have the VHS releases from the 90's, but have been holding out on getting the DVD's for a reason. Even though they are little changes, I feel that the new versions did something to betray the originals. I miss the old Ewok song at the end of Ep. VI. I enjoyed it more when the spirit of Anakin Skywalker actually looked like the Anakin who died in Luke's arms.

The older ones made them appear as unsung heros, the largest celebration of their victory provided by the Ewoks and any rebels who had survived. Undoubtedly, the entire galaxy would hear about the defeat eventually, but showing huge celebrations simultaniously made it seem as if their fight wasn't as personal as it was sometimes meant to feel.

Granted, Ep. IV's changes are not as dramatic, but they still create a different feel to it. This is just the opinion of someone who is a fan - not a fanatic, but I will definately be purchasing this version in the near future.",1152921600,12,1469,4.4535315985130115

379592,4,6301773551,"Fans have been clamoring for the original, theatrical ""Star Wars"" movies from the 70s and 80s for years now. But by the time director George Lucas put them out on DVD, he had redone the trilogy with new special effects and inserted scenes.

Buuuuut... that's not what the fans have wanted. They wanted the unadulterated original. And until the end of December, a special two-disc edition of the classic, groundbreaking ""Star Wars IV - A New Hope"" will be available, with both the theatrical and the new versions. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to cost any more than a one-disc DVD.

Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is bored and frustrated on his uncle's moisture farm. That all changes when his uncle buys two new droids, C3P0 and R2D2 (Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker), the second of which leads Luke to the eccentric old Ben Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness) -- and a transmission of a beautiful princess (Carrie Fisher) asking for Kenobi's help.

At first, Luke doesn't plan to go, since he still has to help his uncle with the harvest. But when he returns home to find his uncle and aunt murdered by Imperial stormtroopers, he agrees to come with Kenobi and help rescue the princess -- and train to become a Jedi knight, ""like my father."" But to rescue the princess, he and his new friends will venture into the heart of the planet-destroying Death Star, and have to deal with the evil Darth Vader...

Lucas's movie was a groundbreaking moment in cinematic history -- nobody had ever done special effects or science fiction like this before, and it made the mold for future stories with battleships, evil overlords and distant planet. What was better, it was spiced up with influences from Akira Kurosawa to J.R.R. Tolkien, and sprinkled with some Eastern philosophy for ""the Force.""

This was also the biggest role for the three stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, as the naive young farmboy-turned-hero, the feisty princess, and the jaded outlaw. They all did very solid jobs, even with the most awkward bits of dialogue, as they run around the slick, claustrophobic Death Star and the slightly run-down Millennium Falcon.

What's the difference between the two versions? Plenty, actually. Many of the scenes just have a CGI character or two wandering around, or a ship swooping down over a control tower. But some scenes were never in the original at all (stormtroopers scouting in the desert), and others were cut, redone and put back in again (like Han's nasty encounter with Jabba in the hangar).

Some of these changes are good, some are bad. The best ones are the insertion of tiny moving pilots into the X-wings. But it's worth sacrificing that to have the original bar scene back, as it was in 1977: The original featured Han talking to a bounty hunter, and then shooting him under the table; the remastered one has a very fake-looking shot of the hunter shooting first... and missing.

Is it actually bad? Not really; the dramatic punch of scenes like the approach of the Millennium Falcon or the victory over the Death Star are still unmarred. But it feels like it's been slicked down until it loses the raw, groundbreaking appeal that the original had. It's a credit to the theatrical version that this many years later, people still want to see it in its original glory, dated special-effects or not.

Fans of both versions of ""A New Hope"" will find them in this two-disc edition, and those who just want the theatrical can switch it to a single box. Either way, it's certainly worth the money.",1152576000,,3515,4.7775947281713345

But don't change plot details of your film just because you don't like them now twenty years after the fact.  You don't add blush to the Mona Lisa.  Leave it alone.  He better not touch one frame of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or I'm burning Skywalker Ranch to the ground.  At least when Steven Spielberg changed shotguns to walkie-talkies for the re-release of E.T., he gave consumers the choice and released both versions on DVD.

First of all, I am NOT what anyone would consider a ""STAR WARS"" fan, so, somewhat understandably, I did not get TOO irritated with your ""Special Edition"" revamping -- although I never quite warmed up to your addition of a very CGI-looking ""Jabba the Hutt"" (which you could have simply requested to have digitized to look more ""animatronic"" like the puppet model used in ""Return of the Jedi""). However, you thoroughly ticked me off with the silly ""Mos-Icicle"" Vaudeville comedy-bit additions, and you ""REALLY"" went over the line by trying to have us all play ""make-believe"" that ""Greedo shot first."" (Yeah, right....)

But then you went on to present yourself as the ""biggest COWARD in motion picture history"" when you emphatically declared that you'd NEVER approve the release of the ""original theatrical editions"" of your ""Star Wars saga"" on DVD, even going as far as to claim that the original prints 'no longer existed' (yeah, I'll just bet) -- then you likewise proceeded to digitally ""revamp"" your first nationally released film, ""THX-1138,"" a movie which was perfect just the way it was originally presented.

NOW you have outdone even yourself in that you have now exposed yourself as the ""BIGGEST LIAR"" in human history with this ""(re)introduction"" of the ORIGINAL 1977 ""theatrical version"" of the film we then knew only as ""STAR WARS,"" bringing it finally to the DVD format! Then have the nerve to include the reworked ""Special Edition"" which nearly all of the film's fans ALREADY have!!!

You've played your hand, George! And you've shown your ""TRUE"" colors! (Or, at the very least, you've shown which ""color"" motivates you the most -- ""green""!)

First release: The Star Wars Trilogy is finally here on DVD in a four-disc set!

Fans' Responses: Yes!! But, they are the same altered versions as the Special Editions with even more ""meaningless"" changes. Flawless bonus disc.

My Response: Yes!! Personnaly, I'm glad that the altered versions were used. It wouldn't make any sense to release just the original versions by themselves on DVD. You never see something like THAT, do you? Great Bonus Disc.

Second Release: Same as previous, but without Bonus Disc.

Fans' responses: George just simply wants an extra dollar out of our pockets. What's with George taking the fourth disc out?! Give us the Theatrical Editions!

My Response:O-kay kind of a weird release, but is it a crime to legally make money? Why don't fans gripe at Peter Jackson for releasing a 2-disc King Kong set AND a single-disc Kong DVD? (FYI) George Lucas said he would never release the Theatrical Versions on DVD. Fans, get that through your skulls!!!

Third Edition: Trilogy with both the Theatrical AND Special Editions.

Fans' responses: ABOUT TIME!!! I'm not going to buy the set AGAIN however.

My response: Good job Lucas!! You've taken what was already perfect, and improved it! Fans, George said he would never release the Theatrical Versions on DVD, but just for the fans, he's decided to do it. And what does he get? More insults. If I were George, due to the fan's opinion's, I would cancel production of the TV show and put Star Wars on the shelf. It's not like you didn't HAVE to buy the other releases and its not like you couldn't just sell what you have, and use the money for this release!

Conclusion: George Lucas has done fantastically over the years. Why am I even calling you people out there ""fans""? Are you sure you like Star Wars?

For a long time he refused to re-release these original versions at all, saying that the latest ""Special Editions"" were his original intention, and the version of the films he was most happy with. In other words, ""tough"" to all those who wanted the 'Original Theatrical Releases' on DVD (ie. versions of Star Wars without the new computer jiggery-pokery added in the 1997 'Special Editions').

Lucas spent millions clearing up the original negatives for the recent DVD release (the digital mastering house responsible for the clean up commented that some *single* frames contained over a million pieces of dirt!). He also spent further money touching up some of the dodgier 'computer effects' that had been added in 1997 (this time without telling anyone; he did it just because he wanted to) for the release.

Nobody complained about the amount of work that must have gone into making these DVDs LOOK so stunning. Their visual quality was nothing short of amazing: The original low-budget ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" matched it's high budget sequels in visual polish. The only complaints came from fans of the original theatrical releases: ""Han shot first!"", they exclaimed, referring to the infamously altered cantina scene.

They still wanted their 'original theatrical release' on DVD. They didn't want the new special effects. They didn't care that George Lucas said that his new version was the way he claims he'd always wanted Star Wars to be... they just wanted their original memories of the film they grew up loving to be on DVD.

After years of this pressure, and safe in the knowledge that most people had already bought his ""intended"" versions of Star Wars, he decided to go back and see if he actually *could* release the ""original theatrical releases"" to appease these pestering fans.

""No!"", was the inevitable answer. He'd already spent millions restoring the original negatives, piecing them together for his ""final finished version"" of the Star Wars movies, why should he go back and spend *more* money doing it all over again for a small, but vocal, collection of fans?

Then someone pointed out that in the mid-nineties a Laser-Disc version of the ""original theatrical releases"" had been released. The quality was actually pretty good, and the masters used in the Laser-Disc's release still existed! Basically it would be possible to use these masters to create a new DVD release of the 'original theatrical versions', plus it would be cheap and easy to do. The masters weren't anamorphic, but they were certainly better than the VHS versions that had been available, even better than the Laser-Disc versions that they had been used to make, and it beat the alternative: Not releasing the 'original theatrical releases' and still having upset fans.

So the wheels were put into motion: For a ""limited time"" only these ""new"" DVD versions would be available to the public, with one stipulations: They came with George Lucas's ""final finished versions"" that had already been released (why should he suffer under the thought that someone might be watching the 'original theatrical releases' thinking that they were the 'finished' versions?).

These masters have allowed these DVDs to exist, and the only reason they DO exist is to appease the vocal fans who demanded them. There was NO way Lucas was going to go back and spend further money on what is essentially a niche item for a selection of vocal hardcore fans. Plus he didn't want to go back to the versions of Star Wars that had tortured him since their release, what with all their little inconsistencies and poor special effects... that was NOT how he wanted Star Wars to be.

So, what are these releases actually like? Well, I've seen the screenshots that have been released (you can find them online if you search) and thankfully these editions look a *million* times better than any previous versions of the 'original theatrical releases' that have been available.

I for one, am pleased. For once George Lucas listened to his fans, at least somewhat, and (within reason) he's given them what they wanted and could not have gotten any other way.

Remember, though:
- They're NOT anamorphic, so the quality isn't as high as it could be.
- This is the ONLY way we're ever going to see them. (Sadly.)

I'm one of the one original people who petitioned George Lucas in the first place and these DVDs are a Good Thing if you care about seeing or owning the 'original theatrical releases' and film preservation. The quality is still VERY GOOD (look online and see for yourself) and this is, unfortunately, the only way we're ever going to get them.",1151712000,13,4962,4.92814371257485

But that doesn't apply to the average consumer, and honestly, if you are someone who is largely satisfied with your VHS tapes or laserdiscs of the original films, or if the newly restored versions don't bother you, then you really have no reason to complain, because you have no reason to purchase these new DVDs. If you're angry that the films aren't being presented in anamorphic widescreen or DTS (or if you're so shallow as to complain about the box-art), then you have to ask yourself what's more important: The audio and visual presentations of the films on DVD, or the films being released in their original form? Yes, it's a trade-off, but unless you don't care about shelling out more money for yet another needless set of videos -- and given all the complaints I've read, a lot of you do care very much -- then you'll have to decide.

Blame Lucas as much as you like for being money-hungry and insensitive to his fanbase. You have a right to feel sore. But let's not forget that those of you who have purchased multiple editions of this trilogy again and again on different video formats are the ones responsible for that. If you've been unsatisfied with the video releases of Star Wars up until this time, you should have never purchased them. If you're unsatisfied with these new releases, don't purchase them either. You have a choice, and if you're upset that these new releases aren't the way you've always wanted them, then you don't have to settle for an inferior product. You'd be better off waiting for George to have the big one, because I'm sure whoever takes over his estate will capitalize just as much on the franchise (without any concerns over Lucas's ""vision"").

And by the way, as long as there continue to be new video formats, there will always be re-releases. Just because Lucas will yet again update his films for HD and Blu-Ray formats doesn't necessarily mean that you need to support those updates by purchasing them every time he makes a few insignificant changes. You're the ones making the decision that the new extra features and improved quality is enough to warrant re-purchasing them. Even if HD and Blu-Ray will look and sound significantly better compared to the restored DVDs, the DVDs available now will still continue to look and sound pretty damn good.

In all honesty though, it would be a great tie-in slogan for this year's ""limited edition"" release.  I really should be in marketing.  Anyway, brace yourselves folks, because you're finally gonna get to relieve this classic moment over and over to your hearts delight...in all it's 2.0 Dolby Surround and Full Screen glory!?!?

  I have absolutely no intentions on buying these when they are released.  I bought the 2004 boxset when it came out, and I'm VERY pleased with it.  However, just when I thought that was it, he re-released it last year, WITHOUT extras.  The only thing that was better about last year's version was the vintage artwork on the boxset.

  That brings us to this year's version.  Why would George Lucas FINALLY decide to release the originals to those hardcore fans that've been clamoring for them, only to do it with subpar quality? Is it laziness?  Is he on a power trip?  I'm sorry, but without Dolby 5.1 and Widescreen format, I wouldn't purchase these versions from the $5 bargain bin at Wal-Mart.  The fans, especially those who've waited for these versions for so long, deserve better...and should wait even longer.  I'll give you 2 reasons why.

  HD-DVD and Blu-Ray.  Which technology will succeed?  The answer, my fellow consumers and SW fans alike, will ultimately be determined by us.  Once the smoke clears, and the true next-gen format has been determined, there's not a doubt in my mind that George will once again re-release an original trilogy boxset w/both the original and special editons intact.  Only, and I mean ABSOLUTELY ONLY after this version is released will I ""consider"" buying this boxset yet again.

  For the fans who feel that they must absolutely own these movies now, my words are falling on deaf ears.  For those who have patience, I'm sure you agree with my sentiments whole-heartedly.  Remember, Han's STILL going to shoot first.  When he does however, I'd prefer to view and hear it in the best format possible.",1150848000,16,2105,4.815126050420168

It's like he's saying, ""all right, I'll give you what you want, but I'm going to make it as rotten as possible.  Take it or leave it.""  When did he stop listening to we, the fans.  We were the generation that bought movie tickets in the 70's and 80's.  We were the ones that skyrocketed the box office numbers for these films, and he is dismissing us.  Instead, he went back in the 90's, added some of the most dreadful cgi footage I have ever seen, and replaced the old songs with very cheesy remakes.  Lucas is telling the older fan base that our Star Wars were not good films in their original state, and that they have been improved, and we should be terribly grateful for his ""altered"" galaxy.  Well I am not amused, in fact, I am insulted that such a large fan base should be so disregarded.  The newer Star Wars films were cinematic abombinations, and now the classics are being sucked into the same terrible void.

I don't want to join the cacophany of others who whose only sentiment seems to be that lucas can do nothing right.  I (mostly) liked Episode I and (less so) episode II, and enjoyed III quite a bit.  I don't see much problem with the new editions of IV-VI.  What issues I have with them are minor and limited mostly to the additional scenes.  I happen to prefer the ""polishing"" that so many purists (gag) took issue with.

I would also like to own a copy of the original theatrical releases on DVD, but I don't want to have to buy or download bootlegs to get them.  But I simply don't want to buy the same product once again in a ""limited edition"".  I frankly don't know if I'll buy these.  Even putting aside picture and sound quality issues, relegating landmark film classics to a bonus feature on a DVD seems blatantly disrespectful.  It is, however, in keeping with Lucasfilm's recently adopted tradition of being unable to offer anything without the taint of crass commercialism; i.e. accompanying announcements of DVD releases on the official website with announcements for video games or Lego's.

What would I like to see?  The same thing every reasonable fan would settle for at this point.  Decent transfers of the original films in their own dedicated set, anamorphic, maybe some cool artwork on the cover.  I don't think that's too much to ask.

Why was anyone surprised at all this would be the way Lucasfilm would handle the final (?) release in what has been a lucrative franchise?  After all, the proposed television projects (and the IMAX 3-D versions being rumored) aside, there will be no more ""Star Wars"" in the future.  Let's at least recognize, albeit grudgingly, the genious of Lucas to maximize beyond even his expectations, the profits from this ""labor of love.""

Hasn't he become the businessman, the ESTABLISHMENT, he says he hated when he began his career?

Star Wars....The point is that Lucas says ( in Star Wars Insider) that he is listening to the millions of fans when he made the decision to release the 1977/1980/1983 original versions of the first trilogy films.  A point that seems to be missed by everyone is that although the originals are being released for the first time ever, they are included  as a bonus feature, on disk 2 of a set of DVD's that previously was unavailable separately. The main disk is the previously released SED version, but not collectively boxed as  a 3 title set.  So in a way he has kept his word. The titles still being advertised are, Star Wars: A New Hope, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.  ( Notethat: The Special Edition phrase was removed from the packaging of the 2004 and 2005 packaging)The 1997 versions are in 5.1EX and the extras are presented in Dolby Stereo 2.0 (anyone with Dolby Pro Logic II can still set their receiver to deliver 5.0 sound on a receiver capable of doing 5.1 or better) and to some people who don't own a 5.1 system, they are still going to like it. Also there is the Nostalgia ( No ""Episode IV - A New Hope"" that was added to the 1978 re-release)There are also rumors that the originals are not in Widescreen. WELL, truth be told, the discs are being released in both Full and Wide, and it is even noted here on Amazon that even the extras disk is also in Widescreen.  Lucas did say that when SW was re-released on VHS for One Last time, he was speaking the truth in that these new releases will be in 2.0 and no THX, but at the time, DVD was not even a afterthought. DVD technology only came about as the 2nd generation of Philips/Magnavox's CD-i gameing console was playing movies ( Analog CD-quality)on the CD-i players. My suggestion to those of you who won't buy the DVD because you already own the SED DVD, You can always Netflix disk 2, or buy the 2 disk set, and sell your 1st disk on ebay. If you haven't bought the 3 disk collection in the silver or gold boxes, depending on your preference.

And I bought the laser disc of this version in 1997. It was advertised as something like ""own the originals for the last time"". He gave statements that he would never again release them and forever forward would be the new updated versions with the added extra special effects.

  George is money hungry. He is a billionaire but he needs a constant influx of money to keep his own empire going. What else does George have or do but Star Wars? His own directing abilities were in serious question, as well as his writing skills when Star Wars 1,2,and 3 hit the theaters.

Hey, I thought, I already own these movies in 3, yes 3, versions.  But what the heck-Lucas and co. are saying they'll never release the original versions of the film on DVD anyway, so why not make it 4?

 Now we're looking at yet another release of the films.  This is promised to be a ""Limited Edition,"" which probably means it will only be out until demand subsides and they can release another version.  If this were a new Dolby or Hi Def release of the original movies I may consider them, but its not.  It's a rehashed release of the Laserdisc version of the films from 13 or so years ago, hideously outdated and ignorant of the technological advantages of DVD.  I'm not going to bite on this release-I've had enough for the time being.

 When (and to me it's a question of when, not if) Lucas finally decides to put forth a bit of effort and release Episodes IV-VI in a format that's not 15 years outdated I'll buy, though by this point I feel I shouldn't.  But I see no reason to buy this release.  Before the first DVD version came out Lucas said he wouldn't release the original films on DVD until after Episode 3-that turned out to be a lie.  Then he said he'd never release the original theatricals on DVD-that, too has proved untrue.  I'm fairly certain that we'll get a new version of the theatrical releases soon, maybe one that will be worth owning.  Until then I can be patient-Lucas is apparently so willing to bleed his die-hard fans dry that the only true ""definitive"" release of the films will be the one Lucas does right before he, himself, passes on.  Only then will these poor, tired classics get a rest.",1150329600,27,2134,4.434447300771208

I was charmed by all of this,and the baddies have a genuine sense of terror. In the acting department,Peter Cushing (not unlike Goebbels)is particularly convinicing,no doubt aided by the palpable sense of discomfort having to deliver the dismal script.

However,even by the standards of light entertainment,the story telling is pretty cluttered and the acting(a few notable exceptions)from the balsa wood school of dramatic art.

The only copy I ever bought (besides the video disc versions from 25 years ago back when George said he didn't want to release them on home video at all) was the 1997 special edition boxed set on laserdisc.

That's the version(s) I want. I was surprised to learn he finally caved in and decided to release the original theatrical versions for a limited time. I'm not completely sure, but I have a hunch that he means it this time. The original versions he has stated on numerous occasions were works in progress.

But what added fuel to the fire was the offical statement released by LUCASFILMS, saying that we do not have the offical prints and they are in a bad state....

If other studios can do it, why not for a set of films that generations have grown up loving..Passing a sub standard package for the sake of increasing the company's revenue is rather unsettling....

I for one have nothing but utter respect for George Lucas. I am a photographer and fellow artist and have nothing but respect for peoples artistic stances and opinions. I don't have even one ounce of contempt for this man. He had the desire to go back and make his pictures better in terms of special effects and he did. Because of this people bashed him like he was the 2nd coming of Lucifer. As if the public somehow owned the rights to these pictures now and the fact that he was tinkering with them was a sin beyond all other sins. He had the artistic integrity to stand by his work even when the majaority of the fan base was screaming bloody murder, he stood by his work.

I for one knew that he would eventually release the original theatrical cuts, not because he has abandonded his artistic integrity but because it was the right thing to do both for the fans and for his company. This is what everyone has been screaming for for the last 8 years incuding the people who run Lucasarts Inc. They stand to make a great sum of money by releasing these again and I don't blame them for doing it. This is not some cheap double dip that we see every week by Fox and every other studio out there these days. This isn't a super cool edition, a super duper extreme edition, an ultimate edition or anything like that. This is quite simply what everyone has been asking for.

So my hats off to Lucas. Star Wars has definitly come full cirlce now and this release will satisfy every last Star Wars fan out there. I loved the original editions and I loved the remastered editions as well. I just have too much respect for these movies and Lucas to let a couple changes that he desired to make have any effect on my overall view of him and this series.

As for the people still complaining, I guess no matter what you do these days some people will just be ignorant and complain. Its obvious that no matter what Lucas does your just going to [...] some more. Dont get me wrong, I am against double dipping like no other and have repurchased countless DVD's due to some studios pathetic marketing techniques. I however do not even begin to group Lucas in with these other studios and will happily plop down another 40-70$ to get the original Star Wars saga on DVD and will happily do it again when they are released onto HD-DVD.

First the original trilogy was released on VHS.  Then the special edition on VHS.  Then the special edition on DVD.  Then the special edition again on dvd with a few more tweaks, and I've lost count, but I think there was even more releases.  Now we're getting the original version on dvd, but not cleaned up.

How do I know all of this?  I don't.  But just look at the past trend, and it makes sense to assume that this will NOT be the final release of the original trilogy.

I tell you one thing, I am not going to buy this cheap 13 year old laserdisc transfer, especially since there will likely be a better release someday.  If the entire set is released and they are ALL cleaned up and episodes 4-6 are the ORIGINAL versions, then I will spend the money.  But until then, I am keeping the versions I already have.

I thought the enhanced visuals and scenes did sort of add to the movie, although I did not like the fact they digitally removed the original Anakin Skywalker from the end of Return Of The Jedi, and replaced him with the new Anakin Skywalker from Revenge Of The Sith.

Now all that being said I have to admit I would probably by these DVD's for the option of being able to chose which version I want to watch, there is something to be said for the classic, remembering the films I loved growing up. I would however beg George Lucas and Lucasfilms to make this the last re-issue of the film, and maybe turn his attention to making something new.

This is not a Roger Corman film release where if the reels are in order, that's ""good enough,"" this is George Lucas who wants theaters to convert to digital but yet is willing to base a new release from a compressed digital print?

The official word is that this is ""fun' and ""free"" as a bonus so we shouldn't expect anything more - but if you think about, wasn't EVERY SCRAP of Star Wars footage digitalized and CLEANED UP for the SE releases back in 1997 and on? So, the footage is already there digitized and cleaned - the SE containing NEW scenes but instead of basically just going back to SAVE AS version #1 ... he decides that it's better to avoid that truth and just buy some laserdiscs off eBay and hit RECORD in IMOVIE.*

The tragedy is this release is no better than the bootlegs it's trying to combat!  It's essentially, an ""official"" original Star Wars bootleg DVD.

Very sad to continue seeing George Lucas and Lucasfilm treat this trilogy with such disrespect.

Not the point!  The point is Lucas is releasing the original theatrical release.  The poor transfer is a kick at the fans, sure.  But how bitter is the taste in his mouth at this release?  This is a major victory!  Savor it.

First, the quality of an average modern TV set is superior to that of the theater in which I first learned of the new hope for the rebellion.  The quality of my current 19"" set will surely be inadequate to the quality this upcoming transfer.  Lucas' last attempt to pee on the fans misses me entirely.  I win.  I get the original release and at the same quality.

Second, if you boycott this release, Lucas wins.  He gets to say, ""See: despite the petitions and complaints, there were no great masses yearning to buy the original release.  These complainers will never be happy, so why bother to appease peasants?""  (sound of breathing apparatus here)  ""It's not about what the fan wants.  It's about my vision,"" says the Emperor.

And guess what? They're all still GREAT! I figured since anyone could get a copy of the series on videotape in the original version, then, hey it was really cool for Lucas to update the movies with some new effects and plot points and stuff. They weren't too impressive, but still, they added something new to something I'd seen a gazillion times.

Meanwhile, many of my fellow Star Wars fans went ape...uh...crazy. HOW DARE YOU ruin MY MOVIES!!!!They thundered! As if they had wrote, directed, funded or produced these movies or something. Hey guess what, you don't like it, don't BUY it! Try a rental. Read some reviews. Whatever. And after years of adults whining like children about how Lucas RUINED the movies, he goes back on his artistic vision (yeah, I know you'll probably debate that too, but he did create these movies, didn't he? Hmmm?) and what he initially promised and decides to throw the losers a bone. And he released the movies in their original release format, without the digital edits.

And guess what? Now these losers start complaining wah wah about all the money they blew because they BELIEVED the guy, and he just wants to rip everyone off and how dare he. You know, he's plenty rich already. The problem is, he's trying to feed the ravenous beast called his fans and some people are never satisfied. I have this little store near me called Amoeba records. You can buy and sell used DVDs there. If you don't have somethng similar to that, there's also a little thing called EBay.

At any time, you can buy OR sell practically any DVD in existence. Of course, you won't be the absolute first guy on the block to have the newest, mintiest freshest release of a movie unless you want to pay a premium. So why take out your own obsession on George Lucas? Sure, he's rich, and yes, his decision to update then unupdate the movies is a little questionable. But try waiting a little while and then buy what you will at your convenience. For cheap! Sorry guys, you took advantage of yourselves!

Anyway, these movies rock. All of them. Even the Phantom Menace, sucky as it may be, has its wonderful moments and helps to introduce the whole story. They Rock. Go ahead and give this 1 star because you ripped yourself off. That doesn't change what these movies did for me and all of you as children, and for the whole freakin' movie industry.

Lucas should take a page from Anchor Bay and their distribution of the Evil Dead films.  They release countless versions of the trilogy, but at least they give the fans what they ask for: Director's Cut, Extended editions, etc.

George Lucas will always be known as the guy that constantly lets down the people that made him who he is today.  He has given nothing back to those fans that have supported since day one.

I have viewed both and the remastered films are certainly cleaner then the bonus disk. Still, the bonus disk theatrical films have accpetable picture and sound (just not as good as his remastered films).

One of the big problems with him previously only releasing the remastered films was that most of us had nothing to compare the new ones with. The entire time I couldn't enjoy the films because I was too busy wondering what was new and what wasn't. Mostly I just noticed the really bad additions like the CGI dance scene at Jabbas palace (in the 3rd film). Now with these new DVDs I can admit that there is some new things I like, for example in ""empire strikes back"" when Luke is trapped in the Wampa ice cavern the remastered film shows the wampa eating a bloody carcas before luke escapes. I thought this was a nice addition.

Be aware that the ""original"" trilogy being offered here as ""bonus material"" is presented in non-anamorphic letterboxed widescreen. This means you will not be able to make full use of your widescreen display, if you have one. The image will simply appear in the middle of the screen, matted on _all four_ sides. Anamorphic widescreen is the DVD standard, and this release should be no exception. In fact, this release should set the bar, not fall short of it.

Yes, it has been confirmed that the 1993 laserdisc masters are being used for this release. These are the versions of the films that appear on the 1993 Definitive Collection laserdisc set and the 1995 ""Faces"" laserdisc and VHS sets.

A few days ago, I got back a report I commissioned from NASA.  It cost approximately $300,000, mostly for some time on an IBM distributed supercomputer.

It is astonishing that a man allegedly invested in advancing the cinematic arts and technology would treat some of the greatest movies ever in such a cold and callous way.  Those theatrical versions made him into the global juggernaut he is today, and he can't even be bothered to make a vaguely acceptable formated copy of them for today's market.  It is truly amazing.

Hope was all but lost that the non-SE versions would ever see the light of DVD. But then the announcement came and all was right with the world. Finally LucasFilm was releasing official DVDs of the films that started it all in, I presumed, the best quality possible because, hey, this is LucasFilm. They stand for top notch quality and presentation. All of their previous DVDs have featured incredible picture and sound, so this announcement was a wonderful surprise. Even though the original theatrical versions were to be released on the second disc of a two-disc package with the main feature being the 2004 Special Edition which I already have since I bought the previously released 4 Disc Trilogy box set, and even though the Original Unaltered film would be relegated to the second disc of said 2 Disc package as ""bonus material,"" I wasn't too concerned given LucasFilm's track record of fabulous treatment of bonus material. Every other previous Star Wars DVD had some wonderful supplements - all enhanced for widescreen displays which is very forward thinking to a time when widescreen HDTVs will be in households all over the country. Just another reason to have confidence in LucasFilm.

Then a few days later, Bill Hunt at thedigitalbits.com broke the news that the transfers for the Original Theatrical Versions were going to be ported over from the most recent (circa. 1992/93) widescreen laserdisc transfer and not be enhanced for widescreen displays. LucasFilm has confirmed this in an email sent by Lynne Hale and in published interviews with LucasFilm employees. This news is unfortunate on many levels. For one thing, given the state of the Home Theater art LucasFilm is essentially releasing a sub-par product. These days widescreen films are always enhanced for widescreen displays - more detail is shown because of the extra lines of resolution. There isn't a studio that does not carry out this practice, no matter how low a film's box office take it will be treated to a brand new widescreen transfer that will be enhanced for my widescreen display. But LucasFilm has opted to ignore the industry standard and give us a transfer that is vastly inferior to the mainstream. These films will suffer from loss of detail and the widescreen image will be framed by a large rectangle on my widescreen display. Not a pretty picture!

The original, unaltered Star Wars trilogy, finally on DVD with no droid & alien cartoon antics, no Hayden Christensen's face on Sebastian Shaw's body, no videogame-quality Jabba the Hutt, the original Academy Award-winning special effects, the music we remember... This should be a red-letter DVD release for Star Wars fans. Sadly, it is not.

Here's why you should boycott this release:

1. The picture & sound are intentionally presented in mediocre quality. These DVD's are transferred from the exact same videotape used to create the laserdisc release in 1993. That means a non-anamorphic, muddy, letterboxed picture that will have to be zoomed in to fill widescreen TVs or computer monitors. Lucasfilm refuses to fulfill the basic minimum standards of a current DVD release and make a new transfer. The quality of this DVD presentation will not live up to that of such timeless classics as Caddyshack II & Ishtar.

2. It's overpriced. If Lucasfilm is only willing to toss out these beloved films in this shoddy version, and they are unwilling to spend any time or money at all on their release, that is their right. They should charge accordingly. As bootleg-quality laserdisc transfers, these DVD's should sell for $5-$10, tops. Incredibly, Lucasfilm is charging $90 retail for these three movies! That's almost twice the cost of the (still available) box set with the exact same Special Edition discs!

They're trying to justify the cost by bundling the unaltered movies (the only reason to buy this version) with the Special Edition movies, but they must know it's a sham. Anybody who is willing to pay $90 ($60 @ Amazon) for the Special Edition DVD's has already bought the existing box sets. The Special Edition discs in this set are a complete waste of plastic, and they do not justify the outrageous cost.

If, for some reason, you have not yet purchased Star Wars on DVD, this set may be an adequate value. For anyone else, this set plus the existing box set you already have will run you a total of $160 retail ($110 @ Amazon). Is that a fair price to pay for an intentionally mediocre release of the movie that made Lucas' empire possible? Is it right to release this classic piece of cinematic history with picture and sound quality far below the latest releases of Buckaroo Banzai or Barbarella? I'll leave that for you to decide.",1148601600,30,2400,4.872549019607843

380044,1,6301773551,"Obviously I haven't seen the actual DVDs yet, since they won't be released until September, but I *have* seen the transfer  that will make up the ""bonus feature"" on disc 2, the original 1977 version of ""Star Wars"" (as it was then known.)  I own the 1993 laserdisc.  That was ""state-of-the-art"" THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, but the state of the art has moved on considerably since then.  The transfer will look like trash on DVD, especially blown-up on a widescreen TV.  (Among other things the translation subtitles for the alien languages will be cut-off, since Lucasfilm and Fox decided to put electronic versions in the letterboxing bars rather than use a print with the subtitles burned into the film or at least have the electronic ones placed over the frame where they belong.)

Even if you don't have a widescreen television, you should always insist that any DVD you buy today be ""enhanced for widescreen TVs"" or ""enhanced for 16:9 displays"".  Why?  1)  Chances are your next TV will be a widescreen HD set.  2)  An DVD enhanced for widescreen TVs can only be created from a very high-quality digital video master.  That means the studio can't just slap an existing laserdisc or VHS master created an old print years ago onto a DVD (which is what Lucasfilm is doing here.)  Instead they have to go back to the source material, and *create* a new hi-def digital master in cases where none existed before.  That produces a better looking and sounding result on both standard screens and wide screens.

If you are thinking about buying this disc primarily to get a true high-quality DVD edition of the 1977 film, as I was, save your money.  I already own the Special Edition on DVD and the 1993 laserdisc.  I would have cheerfully bought this new release if it had included a newly remastered, enhanced-for-widescreen edition of ""Star Wars"".  But I'm not paying twice for material identical to what I already have.

Perhaps if enough people ignore this release Lucasfilm will spend the money necessary to do a *proper* release of the film - which contrary to their claims is certainly possible with the use of the latest film restoration techniques and with source material that survives in the hands of private collectors.  I can't imagine that they will have any trouble making their money back, since I, for one, have bought about six different editions of these movies on home video.  But I won't buy this one.

Quite apart from anything else, the three original ""Star Wars"" films, especially this one, are a part of film history.  They changed the industry, they changed the expectations of the audience.  But it was the film released in 1977 that did all that, not the revised, improved and prettied-up version released in theaters many years later.  The original film should always be preserved and made available *as it was* in the best format available for today's audiences and for future generations.  No one can judge the impact the film had by watching the 2nd re-edit of the film done 27 years after the fact.

Vote with your wallets.  Vote ""no"" to a grudging and insulting release.  Vote ""yes"" for a future release done right.  Do *not* pre-order this nonsense.  It may not be too late to change some minds at Lucasfilm.",1148601600,33,3231,4.7571942446043165

It isn't George Lucas who is milking the fans out of more money.  How ridiculous.  Does George Lucas MAKE fans buy unwanted editions?  No: the fans will take what they can get, even if it isn't what they want.

The fans could have protested the release of the special edition DVD's by refusing to buy them. Case Closed. I'm sure most of the complainers out there bought the special editions, since their reviews note that they feel like they are being ripped off now.  I agree that studios today do try to milk fans out of money by re-releasing special editions and the like.  It is sleazy, and I can't stand it either.  This may or may not be the case with these star wars re-releases, but to me, it doesn't matter either way.  Your opinion doesn't matter.  Your angry reviews don't matter.  What you paid money for is what matters to the producers of these DVD's.  In their eyes, what you buy counts as your opinion.

So if you are angry about being ripped off because of this re-release, write an angry letter and mail it to yourself.  Next time a DVD comes out that isn't up to par, don't buy it; simple as that.  Stop acting like mindless consumers, put your money where your mouth is, and spare everyone your hypocritical comments (yes, it is hypocritical to trash a dvd and buy it anyways).

I realize that my comments might come across as harsh, but I mean no disrespect to you all.

Should we just consume everything Star Wars related without thought or question, nor any basis for quality or standards?

It's quite clear a this point, that the people behind these new releases, are doing their best to make them as unappealing as possible.

The attitude behind this marketing ploy is of complete disrespect...

1) They are not putting any effort into the quality of the product.

2) They are not even going to offer the basics of home video standard that the world has come to expect in 2006 with 16x9 enhanced (read: anamorphic) transfers.

3) Instead they intend to source the video from outdated laserdisc transfers from the mid-90's, which is completely unacceptable. Why not just port over the full-screen VHS image while you're saving time, money, etc?

4) Nevermind the fact that they couldn't even see fit to put the individual DVD's in a simple slip box and package the 'trilogy' as it should respectfully be offered, and as any other movie franchise collection would be in 2006... But they've even refused to offer covers that look like a minimal ammount of time was spent to design and promote these inferior discs. Despite the terrible cheap looking photoshopped covers, the aesthetics aren't that significant overall - but it's yet another strike against any thought, care or quality control being devoted to this 'throw-away' release.

So we are simply expected to purchase these DVD's because they are apparently ""Limited Editions"" (perhaps they want these pulled from the market as quickly as possible before anyone has time to realize and publicize on how crappy and insignificant a waste they are?) and because George Lucas and company recognize how much money they can squeeze out of consumers with anything SW related.

Not so.

380099,1,6301773551,"I for one love the Star Wars films.  No one can deny that they were definitely ahead of their time.  In 1977, when the first film was released theatrically, movie-goers were treated to what could only be described back then as pure magic on the silver screen.

Like others, I was ecstatic about finally owning the ORIGINAL trilogy on DVD, the way these films were shown in theaters in '77, '80, & '83.  Sure, George Lucas re-tooled the films in 1997 for the theatrical re-release, and even moreso in 2004 for the DVD release, but let's face facts.  The ORIGINAL films are what made Lucas the bulk of his riches.

So why on earth is he releasing these films without anamorphic enhancement?  As many have stated, it's 2006, and non-anamorphic transfers have become a thing of the past.  Releasing a film anamorphically IS the norm for DVD in this day and age, so again, I ask WHY?

Furthermore, Lucasfilm is touting the ORIGINAL films as no more than BONUS MATERIAL.  To me, and many others, this is a huge slap in the face.  Sure, Lucas feels that the re-tooled CGI laden versions are the definitive films, and as the director, he is certainly entitled to that opinion.  But let's face facts.  It wasn't the special editions that people clamored to see over and over again in the theaters.  It wasn't the special editions whcih earned Lucas & Co. the big bucks.  Furthermore, it wasn't the special editions that were nominated for various Academy Awards.  The films we saw in the late 70's and early 80's WERE and ARE the films that many of us remember so fondly.  To sell these films as simple bonus material is downright ungrateful to the millions of fans who grew up loving these films the way there were shown ORIGINALLY.

But if I must, I can look past the fact that this is bonus material.  However, I can't look past the fact that these films will not be enhanced for 16x9 sets.  That's just uncalled for.

Let me put this in the simplest of terms.  Many people nowadays own widescreen television sets.  Watching an ANAMORPHICALLY ENHANCED widescreen DVD on a widescreen set means that all (or most of the image will fill that screen.  In the case of the Star Wars films, small black bars will be seen at the top and bottom of the set, only because the film was shot wider than the TV itself.

Now, to watch these films with NON-ANAMORPHIC enhancement, approximately 2/3 of your screen will be black bars.  Of course, these TV's have a ZOOM function which will zoom in the image, but be prepared for an even worse image than you expected.

See, this is what Lucas thinks of his fans.  He's simply throwing them a bone by porting over the LaserDisc editions which were produced 13 years ago.  No cleanup, no anamorphic enhancement........nothing.  George Lucas, the same man behind THX and the highest possible standard for audio and visual presentation, can't even adhere to today's standard procedure for producing DVDs, and that's making these films ANAMORPHIC.

I emplor you, please don't buy these films in this current state.  You'll only be proving to Lucas that he was right; that people will buy it regardless of its condition.  We fans deserve better than this.  These films are groundbreaking in every possible way, and as such, should be treated better than this.",1148601600,32,3280,4.666666666666667

Basically they are putting out a cheap and substandard product and saying this is as good as it gets, like it or lump it.

Well guess what? I am going to avoid this dvd at all costs and strongly recommend other viewers to do the same.
George Lucas has every right to update and add new scenes to these films but equally if people wish to see the original versions, then Lucasfilm really should find an old print from somewhere and present a proper dvd restoration of the actual version of the film that went out and did the business in the cinemas on its original release.
Not recognising that and saying that all you can have is a remastered, non Anamorphic Laserdisc version is simply unacceptable.

Star Wars creator George Lucas, who doesn't mind tinkering with his own classics for special edition re-releases said, ""I am very concerned about our national heritage, and I am very concerned that the films that I watched when I was young and the films that I watched throughout my life are preserved, so that my children can see them.""

Does he know the definition of ""hypocrite""?

Lynne Hale of Lucasfilm said,""...since these movies (as originally released) do not represent George's artistic vision, we could not put the extraordinary time and resources into this project as we did with the Special Editions. The 1993 Laserdisc masters represented the best source for providing the original versions as DVD bonus material. Although these are non-anamorphic versions, they do preserve the original widescreen composition of the movies.""

Believe it or not, George Lucas was not the only person involved in the making of these movies. Ask Ralph McQuarrie, John Dykstra, Gary Kurtz, Rick Baker, or Marcia Lucas. Star Wars (what Lucas now calls A New Hope) is a great movie that represents some of the best filmmaking of the 1970's. What Lucas is doing is completely disrespectful to all of those people that were involved in the process of making those films. He's completely disregarding their work and dishonoring their memory.

By the way, last weekend I watched the ""2004 version"" and I didn't think it held up. The scene where Luke and Ben enter Mos Eisley looks too busy and too cartoon-like, in other words, like CGI. The new scene with Jabba: it's redundant. It's a almost a word-for-word retread of the Greedo scene.

Lynne Hale of Lucasfilm also said, ""We want you to be aware that we have no plans - now or in the future - to restore the earlier versions.

We hope you will understand our decision and, again, want to let you know how much we appreciate your interest and enthusiasm.""

Okay Lynne Hale and George Lucas, I want you to be aware that I have no plans - now or in the future - to purchase your poor quality versions of the original movies. Furthermore, I and my family will NEVER spend another dime on any of your future movies.

Lucasfilm is a multi-billion dollar company and it's not willing to spend an extra hundred grand to make it's product better and it's fans happy with an anamorphic print?

Well Lucasfilm, we hope you will understand our decision and, again, want to let you know how much we don't appreciate your lack of interest and enthusiasm.",1148342400,375,2662,4.805251641137856

I don't need to pay money for that.

Personally, I think we'll see the original theatrical versions again in the future. If these can be released after Lucas has already put his foot down, they'll be released again.

- Luke Skywalker yearns to learn the family business, Darth Vader tells Obi-Wan Kenobi he's no square, but, Obi-Wan tells his former apprentice he, once again, has the high ground & spiritually tells Luke to keep the faith in ""Star Wars""

Released 29 & a 1/2 years ago, in less than 32 theaters nationwide (compared to ""Revenge Of The Sith""'s 3600+ theaters), ""Star Wars"" still remains one of the great all time science fiction films, that is a tribute to the Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, & Western serials of the past. ""Star Wars"" gave the dying sci-fi genre a much needed jolt in the arm, in the late 70's & has generated millions of fans the world over. The film, after all these years, still remains one of the highest grossing films in history (currently at 450+ million dollars).

Taking place roughly twenty years after ""Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"", ""Star Wars"" (renamed ""Epiosde IV: A New Hope"" in 1999, after the release of the first prequel film) has the galaxy under the grip of the tyrannical Galactic Empire (the former Republic from the prequel films).

The Empire's ultimate weapon, The Death Star (shown in a skelatal structure at the end of ""Sith"") has come to fruition & spells certain doom for the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom to the galaxy.

Princess Leia, senator of the planet Alderaan, races home aboard her starship after stealing schematic plans to the battle station. Imperial forces, led by Darth Vader, intercept the ship, take Leia hostage, & destroy the ship, but, not before the Princess records a short message to Genaral Obi-Wan Kenobi & downloads the message with the valuable, stolen Death Star plans into a nearby astromech droid. As fate would have it, Artoo-Detoo is the recipient & with his companion See-Threepio use an escape pod to get off the ship blasting to the planet of Tatooine below.

Once on the surface, & through some unusual circumstances, the droids fall into the hands of Owen Lars, & his step-nephew, Luke Skywalker. While cleaning up the two droids, Luke accidently stumbles across the ending of the message Artoo was trying to keep hidden (""Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Your my only hope"").

Luke tells his Uncle about the message & in response wants both droids memory's erased (it must have dawned on Owen that both droids have been here before & he knows the history surrounding them). Luke also asks if he can join the Academy (most of his friends have already gone), but, his Uncle also nixes that idea (as Luke leaves the dinner table, in a huff, Owens wife, Beru, tells him that Luke has to much of his father's spirit in him. Owen's reply, ""That's what I'm afraid of."").

But, Artoo has other plans. Insistent on delivering the message to Obi-Wan, Artoo ditches Threepio, while Luke & his family are at dinner, & goes searching for the Jedi Knight himself. Upon this discovery, Luke sets out early the following morning, with Threepio, & unknowingly sets his destiny to become a Jedi Knight into motion.

""Star Wars"" is the first film to be released, but, is Episode IV, chronilogically in the overall saga. Thanks to the monsterous success of this film, the rest of the saga was a go. ""Star Wars"" was first created as a stand alone film (in case it flopped at the box-office). With its first re-release, the film then had the ""Episode IV, A New Hope"" moniker attached to the opening prologue. Nominated for 11 Oscars (winner of 8).

Over the past 28 years:

""Star Wars"" has been re-released 7 times (including the Special Edition release) in theaters, & released on video 7 times (including the 2004 DVD release, a repricing in the late 80's, & a repackage (very badly) in the early 90's ). I've seen a very early rental copy of ""Star Wars"", with a plastic clamshell box that says ""for rental only"" at the bottom of the box from 1983, go for sale on e-bay, a few years back, for roughly 250 to 300 bucks. Thats a rarity.

Differences over the years:

The film had different audio tracks according to the film's format in theatre's (two types of formats were used in the original release, 35 mm & 70 mm. The 35 mm tracks were recorded first for national distribution while the 70 mm tracks were recorded for special releases. Rumor has it that these tracks weren't finished until the morning of the film's release).

In 1997, the original trilogy was released in theatres as Special Edition's. the negative for ""Star Wars"" was cleaned up with a few new scenes added among them:

The Stormtrooper squad that finds the droids escape pod is a lot bigger than in the original release. Overall, nice effect that either way doesn't kill the film.

Mos Eisley spaceport gets a big redo. Instead of the hole in the ground from the original release, here its a big spaceport complete with ships taking off & all sorts of new scum & villainy walking the streets. Overall, this was always Lucas' vision, but, again, due to time & budget back in the day he had to make due with what he had. Still, he didn't need to take out the werewolf creature from the cantina.

During the confrontation between Greedo & Han Solo, Greedo shoots first while the original shot of Solo firing is now a retaliation shot. The most absolute damning thing George Lucas has done to the moviegoing public (that includes ""Howard The Duck""). This basiclaly destroys some of Han Solo's character. This guy doesn't take s*it from anybody. But, with the tinkering of this shot, its now just in self-defense. It sucks anyway you look at it.

Jabba The Hutt makes an appearance (he was originally supposed to be in the film, but, due to budget & money constraints in 1976, he could never be fully realized). A fully grown Boba Fett is also present in the background setting up his bigger role in ""Empire"". Overall, cool effect & the scene was always meant to be there. But, Jabba looks a bit odd & doesn't look like the Jabba from ""Return Of The Jedi"".

Han Solo is chased by battalions of Stormtrooopers instead of five. Overall, funny effect, but, so was the original.

Certain dogfight scenes were replaced with CGI substitues to make the battle's more tight & fast. Overall, needed in spots & the battle is now more of a grand scale assault.

A new scene between Luke & his friend Biggs Darklighter has been added before the space battle at the climax of the film. Note: a line about Luke's father is cut. As Red Leader is about to speak to Luke & Biggs a crewman walks in front of the camera with Red Leader, saying ""You'll do all right."" The correct line is ""If your as good a pilot as your father was, You'll do all right."" Overall, nice scene that lets the viewer in on a little bit of the friendship between Luke & Biggs before his death.

For the 2004 DVD release:

A new Jabba The Hutt takes the place of the old. Overall, needed. The new Jabba looks more like the ""Jedi"" Jabba, and is better for it.

A 27 year old film gaffe is finally fixed. If you have an old VHS copy of the film, fast forward to the scene where just after Darth Vader cuts down Obi-Wan Kenobi, notice when the big metal doors close, take a careful notice to the color of Vader's lightsabre. Its rotoscope white, not the trademark red. That has finally been fixed. The other gaffe's haven't.

The audio seems a bit off. Whenever Vader speaks, his breathing takes a backseat while his voice is less synthsizory & has more tamber to it. John Williams' classic score is less booming in some scenes & I find that a real problem.

As for this third release for ""Star Wars"", Fox & Lucasfilm have included the original 1977 release as bonus disc material for the second disc.

Video: the transfer is from the 1993 laserdisc transfer for The Definitive Editon box set. Scope ratio 2.35:1 & the transfer isn't that bad. There is grain (I expected that) & some dirt, but the image is quite sharp (I've seen worse on one of the early VHS releases to ""Star Wars""). The color rendition is a lot better than the sickly color hue from the 2004 edition.

Audio: 2.0 Dolby Digital. There is a strong prescence from the front speakers while the surrounds emphasize John Williams' legendary score.

In all honesty, this isn't a half bad release, but, this isn't the final release to ""Star Wars"" on video. With the 30th anniversary to the original ""Star Wars"" looming on the horizen one wonders what the future holds for the ""Star Wars"" saga.",1148169600,,8679,4.582956746287928

First of all, I felt the first half of original 1977 version a bit dull and with the exception of a few of the scenes such as  Princess Leia's hologrammed message recorded in R2D2 had remained in my memory. But thanks to Ani-trilogy I am more eager to watch the first scenes  particularly the re-appearance of Obi-Wan kenobi introduced by Luke Skywalker as Old Ben.

After the appearance of Han Solo a Hollywood counterpart of Captain Harlock, the show begins and I can never take my eyes away from the scene until the end. Some of the scene was added to this newer one. But not much to ruin the old classic.

Thank the Maker he failed in 1977, and we got one of the greatest films of all time.  Certainly not the first time great art has come from the failure of the artist to express his exact vision.

We don't get to see the better film on DVD because George says so.  It is the opinion of the lawyers and the judges that he ""owns"" the film.  This, of course, is typical of any Empire's behavior.  The power rests with the State.

George owns nothing.  We, the people own it.  Not in any financial sense, but in the very real sense that it changed our lives.  Having watched it, it became a part of our memory and a part of history.  No man owns my childhood.  No man owns history.

George bucked the system getting this movie made, and now cowers behind that very system to keep it from being circulated once again.  To say that this DVD is not only the best release, but the ONLY release you are allowed to see, and that the will of the fans amounts to droid droppings next to his Holy word, is Lucas' own definition of going over to the dark side of the Force.

380271,5,6301773551,"When Star Wars Episode III came out, I was advised to see one of the original movies before going to the new one. I wasn't that excited; I wasn't really a science fiction fan. And who really cares about a bunch of spaceships getting shot up and tall guys with capes and shiny black helmets getting decapitated by light-wand swords, anyway.

What I didn't realize was how much more the original Star Wars trilogy was than that.

""Whatever,"" I thought. It was bound to be entertaining. So I willingly watched A New Hope. I finished it grinning from ear to ear.

I made up a new expression- don't judge a movie from its weapons (although lightsabers ARE really cool). Star Wars Episode IV was officially my favorite movie ever.

It was the characters that I liked so much. They're complex. Although Star Wars really is just another battle of good and evil, the twist is that nobody is just ""nice"" or ""mean.""

I immediately loved those endearing sidekicks: R2D2, the stumpy little beeping robotic toddler, C3PO, the nervous gold protocol droid who won't shut up, and Chewbacca, that ""big walking carpet.""

Han Solo is so arrogant and stubborn, but at the same time, lovable. Leia has the famous ""just because you just rescued me doesn't mean I can't help you shoot the villains"" attitude. And though Luke might not seem to have the immediate obvious personality of the other two, he has a likeable thing about him that makes you feel so horrible when bad things happen to him.

For those that don't know anything about Star Wars, I will explain that a Jedi is, first of all, a good guy, a member of a group that basically fights against the Empire (the bad guys) to save the universe. The Sith is a sort of dark Jedi.

The Force is a power that everything has, which can do just about anything that, to put it simply, a ghost could do. It can lift things, move things, squeeze things, all of that. The art to being a Jedi or Sith is to use the force to your advantage.

Droid is short for android, which is a robot.

A lightsaber (don't tell me you don't know what a lightsaber is) is basically a sword, except the blade is made of light. It can be turned off and on easily, which is useful because of its sharpness. It wouldn't be any good to go stabbing yourself with your lightsaber all the time.

The plot is fairly simple.

Young moisture farmer Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who lives with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru on the barren desert planet Tattooine, has big dreams. He has heard of the accomplishments of his late Jedi father, Anakin Skywalker, and he finds out that an Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) taught him. Luke realizes that he has a neighbor named Ben Kenobi, and he is curious, so he decides to go see if the Kenobis have any relation to each other.

Luke finds out that Obi-Wan and Ben Kenobi are the same man. Obi-Wan promises to teach Luke the ways of a Jedi and the ways of the Force. After Luke's aunt and uncle's home is bombed by the Empire, Luke has no reason to stay- he has been sent on a mission: he must rescue the Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher).

With the help of the droids R2D2 and C3PO, and also smuggler/pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his partner Chewbacca, a big, furry, howling Wookiee, and a lightsaber, Luke Skywalker rescues Princess Leia from the Death Star, a planet-sized ship belonging to the Empire, and faces many dangers, including Darth Vader.

That famous seven-foot-tall masked, caped individual is probably more robot than man, but it's hard to tell. His skill with both a lightsaber and the Force are almost impossible to beat.

Though Luke has many dilemmas along the way, the young hero is learning. He will be more than ready for training with Jedi Master Yoda in Episode V.

Anyway, I would DEFINITELY recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch it. From my experience, people who watched Star Wars either loved it or hated it, so I am not guaranteeing anything, but one bit of advice would be this: if you are watching it for the violence, weapons or the special effects, watch Episodes I, II, and III, but I thought that these were lacking in personality and humor, as well (Anakin doesn't smile once in all of Episode III). Episodes IV, V, and VI are stuffed full of character and, though suspenseful at parts, have comic relief quite often. They may not have the best special effects by modern standards, but try to imagine that this is 1977. These were new concepts then.

These classics sucked me into the world of Star Wars (or should I say the universe) and I was glued to the screen the whole time. I was sad when the main characters were, and happy when they were. I think that George Lucas did a tremendous job with the original trilogy, but just lost momentum for the last three.

I still think Star Wars is one of the most amazing movies ever made, if not THE most amazing movie ever made. If you are considering watching it, I will say that it was nothing like how I expected, and I hope that you feel the same way.

Star Wars didn't gain the title of a classic for no reason. It is loved by the country, and if you look hard enough, you can find little bits and pieces from it in modern culture.

I hope you enjoy Star Wars Episode IV. Good luck and use the force!",1133136000,,5256,4.454166666666667
380312,5,6301773551,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a daydreaming farm boy named Luke Skywalker on the desert planet of Tatooine discovers a secret message in the memory banks of a small astromech droid called R2-D2. The tenacious little robot leads the young farmer and his golden protocol droid, C-3PO, to the home of a mysterious hermit who holds the secrets of Luke's past...and future. The hermit's name is Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he is a Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan explains to Luke that he once fought alongside the boy's father, a long dead Jedi named Anakin Skywalker, that Anakin was killed by a dark and twisted former Jedi named Darth Vader, and that his hope was for Luke to carry on in the Jedi ways. Obi-Wan teaches Luke about the Force, an all-encompassing energy field created by life itself that gives the Jedi their seemingly supernatural abilities, from levitation to precognition, to incomparable speed and reflexes. The old Jedi also passes on to Luke the lightsaber of his father and teaches the boy to use the Jedi weapon, a sword of pure energy with the power to cut through nearly anything with the greatest of ease. Together, the aged Jedi, his new apprentice, and the two droids embark on a mission set forth by the message carried within R2-D2; a message from Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan asking Obi-Wan Kenobi to deliver the astromech droid safely to her home planet, for he also carries the secret plans that could help the rebellion destroy the evil Emperor's greatest weapon, the Death Star.

Hiring a seedy Corellian pilot named Han Solo and his copilot, Chewbacca the Wookie, to fly them to Alderaan in the starship freighter the Millennium Falcon, Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids are soon traveling through space at hyper-speed, doing their best to avoid the clutches of the evil Empire along the way. They shortly find themselves unwelcome guests in the lion's den, however, when their search for the now non-existent Alderaan lands them in the heart of the Death Star itself, a space station the size of a small moon with the fire power to destroy an entire planet with one laser blast! Together, the small band of heroes takes the opportunity to perform a dangerous rescue mission, saving the beautiful Princess Leia from the Emperor's vile henchman, Darth Vader, but not without first losing one of their own in the escape. It is now up to the remaining heroes and their princess to see the vital information within R2 is safely delivered to the rebel alliance, and that the Death Star is finally destroyed!

In 1977, young filmmaker George Lucas changed the lives of countless young movie-goers by delivering unto them ""Star Wars,"" a swashbuckling, sprawling space saga of rebellion, romance, and sorcery, in the style of the 1930s serials that inspired it, but with visual effects and imaginative characters the likes of which the world had never seen before! Starring newcomers Mark Hamill as naive and idealistic farm boy Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as dashing, fortune-seeking flyboy Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher as beautiful damsel in distress Princess Leia, along with the unforgettable voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader and screen legend  Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, ""Star Wars"" spun a timeless tale of familiar myth and legend in a whole new way, relying on outstanding acting performances and an incomparable John Williams musical score to take viewers beyond the fantastic surroundings and into the story itself. Drawing inspiration from the annals of film history, borrowing heavily from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" tales of King Arthur, and the works of Akira Kurosawa, not to mention the history of mankind in general, George Lucas's seemingly simple tale is so full of detail and realism, even in its most unbelievable moments, that the viewer easily becomes lost in the adventure. That's just what ""Star Wars"" is, an adventure; a thrill ride for the young at heart!

After its initial release, it was revealed that ""Star Wars"" was merely one chapter in a 6 part saga. To be more specific, the film first known as ""Star Wars"" was, in fact, ""Star Wars, Episode 4: A New Hope."" This led to two sequels that brought the story together as a legendary film trilogy beloved by millions of fans who buy up ""Star Wars"" merchandise greedily to this day! In 1997, ""The Star Wars Trilogy"" was rereleased to theaters for a new generation. It was a rerelease that brought mixed emotions among fans due to the new additions George Lucas had made to his film legacy. Through the magic of digital technology, special effects scenes were improved, deleted scenes were added with new digital characters, and the films were made to fall more in line with Lucas's original vision, which had been impossible to realize fully in the 1970s and `80s. George Lucas was happy. Many fans were not. However, many fans had no problem with the changes and even welcomed them, if awkwardly. It was all a foreshadowing of what was to come. Now, the first three chapters of the ""Star Wars Saga"" have been released as well, and the tale is complete; no longer a simple tale about farm boy Luke Skywalker and his friends defeating an evil galactic empire, but now a much deeper tale of redemption the likes of which was only emphasized before in Episode 6, ""Return of the Jedi.""

With the long awaited DVD release of the original, or ""classic"" Star Wars Trilogy came even more ""improvements"" from creator George Lucas, continuing his attempt to make the six Star Wars films fit together as one epic story. The most noticeable, in this reviewer's opinion anyway (all those complaints about the Greedo scene seem overblown to me, and I'm a huge Han fan), is the scene where Han Solo converses with Jabba the Hutt. First restored to the film with a digital Jabba in 1997, the DVD release offers a NEW Jabba in this scene; one that looks considerably more like the Jabba the Hutt we are all familiar with. While the new CGI Jabba still doesn't seem quite as harmonious with the rest of the picture as such digital characters do in the prequels, the whole scene is still quite an impressive feat and completely welcome as far as this fan is concerned, especially with the much needed update. Though, it kinda makes my action figure of 1997 Jabba pretty pointless. In general, aside from the digital removal of one of my favorite characters, Lak Sivrak (AKA the cantina wolf-man, another of my action figures that has been made obsolete!), I have no problem with the new SPECIAL special editions of the Star Wars saga. Though, as a hardcore fan, it does seem wrong that the original versions are not ALSO available on the DVDs (Disney gives the option on THEIR special editions, after all). Each film in the classic Star Wars trilogy includes an audio commentary option. ""A New Hope"" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, and Dennis Muren. The commentaries are enjoyable, but they were clearly recorded separately, and one wishes that if they had to be recorded that way, that we could have received the complete commentaries of the individuals rather than a single compilation track. Nevertheless, a fun listen. Of course, if you want the other great extras, you'll have to get the whole trilogy set, but don't get your hopes up. The bonus disc in the Star Wars trilogy set is painfully lacking the deleted scenes of Luke and his friends on Tatooine, the 1997 Jabba scene (hey, it'd be nice for historical purposes), the classic Kenner toy commercials we grew up with, AND the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special. Then again, I guess one could come up with tons of extras that could have been included but weren't. That was just MY wish list. We'll see what future DVD rereleases bring. At least those awesome teaser trailers are included on the bonus disc. Anyway, back to the subject at hand, ""Star Wars, Episode 4: A New Hope:"" Still one of the best films ever made, still the same powerful experience (despite alterations), and still my favorite version of Leia!

I owned the complete trilogy DVD set. I really missed StarWars and I was willing to give the new edited versions a chance. The new versions made me feel sick. I had a feeling like I was ripped off. I bought the actual releases, but these new editions made me feel like I was getting cheap Chinese bootlegs. I wanted to relive the experience that I had when I originally saw these movies in the early 80's. They are a huge part of my childhood.

It's not too much too ask for double sided disk (one side with the new editions and one with the originals). Spielberg was kind enough to do that with E.T., and Im glad because I also prefered the original.

Lucas, why are you doing this to your fans? Please consider the films that you loved as a child. What if those were edited from what you remember them as?

For this so-called ""special"" edition, Lucas added several cheesy CGI images and sound effects, then re-edited other scenes, and didn't permit the original on DVD.

From the moment these words filled up the screen to ecstatic audiences in May of 1977, a legend was born.  That's a pretty clich way of putting it (since, chronologically, this happens to be the fourth chapter in the saga), but there is some serious truth behind the impact that this, the original STAR WARS, left upon many viewers.  It's hard to believe that this movie ever got made, too.  It was George Lucas's brainchild project since childhood, but when shooting this movie, he ran into production problem after problem after problem--many executives predicted that STAR WARS would die at the box office.  And now look at what place it has in the history of moviegoers.  If STAR WARS had not been the megahit that it was, there would be no sequels, no prequels, no fans going around reciting memorable quotes from the movie (""May the force be with you!""), and, well, all that it is.

Looking upon STAR WARS, or should I say, EPISODE IV:  A NEW HOPE, it really is not hard to understand why this film became such a status of pop culture.  Sure, it doesn't have the flashy graphics of today's big, loud and noisy CGI films (although this reincarnation does; more on that later)--but what makes this movie such a classic is simply because, at heart, it is great FUN.  The storyline is epic and action-packed (those starship battles and the climactic Death Star Trench fight are always fresh every time), the atmosphere that Lucas created is imaginative and engaging, and, best of all, it has a cast of characters that have quickly become household names--eager, earnest young hero Luke Skywalker; dashing, courageous Captain Han Solo; tempestuous yet regal Princess Leia; furry Wookie Chewbacca; wise, saintly Obi-Wan Kenobi; ruthless helmeted villain, Darth Vader; and of course, those lovable robots (sorry, droids), C-3PO and R2-D2.

It helps, too, that talented performers bring this eccentric cast to life.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine a better trio than Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher as the three human leads, Alec Guiness as the elderly Jedi Master, Anthony Daniels as the golden, worrisome robot, or even James Earl Jones' memorably stentorian voice as Vader (one of cinema's greatest vocal performances ever).  Say what you will about George Lucas' directing abilities, but these guys bring an infectious, lasting appeal to their roles that it makes those in the prequels pretty stiff by comparison.

Equally memorable is John Williams' soundtrack, the title fanfare has been used in every STAR WARS movie to date, and of course, the motifs Williams creates for the characters fit them to a T.  One can only imagine the atmosphere of STAR WARS had it been scored by someone else....

With all this, and more, it's no wonder that STAR WARS's impact is still going strong, and, at the risk of causing controversy, the original trilogy can easily hold its own against some of the more cinematically complex and impressive trilogies of our time such as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, THE GODFATHER, and BACK TO THE FUTURE.

However, George Lucas wasn't satisfied with his original version of STAR WARS (the miniscule budget he received could hardly be enough to develop some of the story's more ambitious scope), so in 1997, he and his company, LucasFilm Ltd., re-released the film as a ""Special Edition"".  This version consists of some added-in and/or altered scenes as well as some more enhanced visual effects.  Purists have opposed these additions, especially since Lucas has not decided to release the original print of STAR WARS on DVD.  While this is a valid argument, Lucas himself has stated that this revamp of A NEW HOPE is HIS vision.  But I don't want to get into the fan controversy about the Special Editions.  On this account, I will say that watching this more beefed-up version is a treat in and of itself; it's interesting (and fun) to pinpoint the differences between the original and the new incarnations.  Admittingly, some of the added-in stuff isn't really necessary (in particular, I COULD probably have done without the altered scene where Greedo shoots first at Han, although I'm not nearly as anal about it as others are), but they hardly affect the flow of the story and just add another level of enjoyment to the experience.

For this DVD release of A NEW HOPE (which coincides with the DVD release of the original trilogy), the movie has been tinkered with yet again, this time to fix some of the more glaring flaws that were present in the Special Editions.  Although it's not completely perfect (I did notice some matte-boxing around some of the starships in some shots), this version is about as good as it can get.  Yes, I would like a chance to own the original on DVD as well, but this presentation is still excellent--the hard work that went into the visual and aural restoration is very commendable and is especially spectacular if you have a widescreen TV or state-of-the-art sound system.

No matter which version it is presented in, though, STAR WARS is still, well, STAR WARS.",1125619200,2,5085,4.848554913294798
380317,5,6301773551,"Make no mistake!  We're talking about the original version of STAR WARS as it was realeased on video ""one last time"" in 1995.  Black and blue box with Darth Vader on the cover.

While the special edition in 1997 was entertaining, it was in no way an improvement for STAR WARS purists, like myself.  The video I'm describing is the original 1977 film before George Lucas started butchering it and it has the benefit of being remastered in THX.

I'm not saying don't own the special edition DVD.  Of course own it!  It looks and sounds perfect!  I'm saying own BOTH!

By the way, everything I've said I also holds true for the 1995 video release of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, as well.  Between the original film and the 2004 DVD release, this film got butchered the most.  The insertion of Ian McDermid into the scene between Darth Vader and the Emperor was beyond shameful!

The general plot:
The movie talks about Luke Skywalker. A young man who lives with his Aunt (Aunt Beru) and Uncle (Uncle Owen). Uncle Owen buy 2 droids who are 3P0 and R2D2. Luke is asked to clean the 2 droids when there is a beautiful woman who appears asking help from Obi Wan. R2D2 runs away to find it's master (Obi Wan), so Luke and 3P0 has to find them. When they do, they meet up with Obi-Wan who offers to take Luke with him on the mission. Luke hesitates and has to ask his uncle and aunt only to find out that they're killed and burnt. Luke has no choice but to go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan. They go to Mos Eisly to find a pilot which is Han. Finally, they go off to Alderaan but before they even reach the planet, it got destroyed by Darth Vader with his Space Station, The Death Star. They try to go back to Tatooine only to be sucked into the Death Star. Luke finds Leia. Obi-Wan leaves them to face Darth Vader and gets killed during their duel. They go back to the Rebel base and group together with the other Rebels to destroy the death Star. Luke ends the movie with a successful destruction of Death Star. The ending is quite touching with the throne room. The triumphant music goes together with it the whole time.

About the film:
This movie is practically better than the new ones now, in the YEAR 2005! I was not born in 1977 yet but when I watched it in the early 2000s, I really didn't think it was made in the 1970s. The style and the whole scenes, they were really spectacular. The special effects, they were magnificent. Even though the technology before wasn't that great, but the way it conveyed generally was so WOW!

This original Star Wars Movie introduced to the world something new and unique. Lightsabers, jedi, lightspeed. Anyone who watches the movie would enjoy it.

This movie is the one that started it all back in 1977 introducing us to that Galaxy far far away. Now however everything that i see every charater, every bit of dialogue and ever planet makes so much more sense to me because of the fact the history has been told. But what makes this movie so good is the fact that the great Harrison Ford is in this film as the crafty smuggler Han Solo. Everything he says and does in this movie is just awesome. When you speak to the fans everyone's favorite scene is him pretending to be a storm trooper. I adore this movie so much more now thanks to episode 3, because after what is seen and done you just need that little bit of light back in your system. 'A New Hope' delivers on that account.

Released 28 years ago today in less than 32 theaters nationwide (compared to ""Revenge Of The Sith""'s 3600+ theaters), ""Star Wars"" still remains one of the great all time science fiction films, that is a tribute to the Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, &  Western serials of the past. ""Star Wars"" gave the dying sci-fi genre a much needed jolt in the arm, in the late 70's & has generated millions of fans the world over. The film, after all these years, still remains one of the highest grossing films in history (currently at 450+ million dollars).

Taking place roughly twenty years after ""Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"", ""Star Wars"" (renamed ""Epiosde IV: A New Hope"" in 1999, after the release of the first prequel film) has the galaxy under the grip of the tyrannical Galactic Empire (the former Republic from the prequel films).

The Empire's ultimate weapon, The Death Star (shown in a skelatal structure at the end of ""Sith"") has come to fruition & spells certain doom for the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom to the galaxy.

Princess Leia, senator of the planet Alderaan, races home aboard her starship after stealing schematic plans to the battle station. Imperial forces, led by Darth Vader, intercept the ship, take Leia hostage, & destroy the ship, but, not before the Princess records a short message to Genaral Obi-Wan Kenobi & downloads the message with the valuable, stolen Death Star plans into a nearby astromech droid. As fate would have it, Artoo-Detoo is the recipient & with his companion See-Threepio use an escape pod to get off the ship blasting to the planet of Tatooine below.

Once on the surface, & through some unusual circumstances, the droids fall into the hands of Owen Lars, & his step-nephew, Luke Skywalker. While cleaning up the two droids, Luke accidently stumbles across the ending of the message Artoo was trying to  keep hidden (""Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Your my only hope"").

Luke tells his Uncle about the message & in response wants both droids memory's erased (it must have dawned on Owen that both droids have been here before & he knows the history surrounding them). Luke also asks if he can join the Academy (most of his friends have already gone), but, his Uncle also nixes that idea (as Luke leaves the dinner table, in a huff, Owens wife, Beru, tells him that Luke has to much of his father's spirit in him. Owen's reply, ""That's what I'm afraid of."").

But, Artoo has other plans. Insistent on delivering the message to Obi-Wan, Artoo ditches Threepio, while Luke & his family are at dinner, & goes searching for the Jedi Knight himself. Upon this discovery, Luke sets out early the following morning, with Threepio, & unknowingly sets his destiny to become a Jedi Knight into motion.

""Star Wars"" is the first film to be released, but, is Episode IV, chronilogically in the overall saga. Thanks to the monsterous success of this film, the rest of the saga was a go. ""Star Wars"" was first created as a stand alone film (in case it flopped at the box-office). With its first re-release, the film then had the ""Episode IV, A New Hope"" moniker attached to the opening prologue. Nominated for 11 Oscars (winner of 8).

Over the past 28 years:
""Star Wars"" has been re-released 7 times (including the Special Edition release) in theaters, & released on video 7 times (including the 2004 DVD release, a repricing in the late 80's, & a repackage (very badly) in the early 90's ). I've seen a very early rental copy of ""Star Wars"", with a plastic clamshell box that says ""for rental only"" at the bottom of the box from 1983, go for sale on e-bay, a few years back, for roughly 250 to 300 bucks. Thats a rarity.

Differences over the years:

The film had different audio tracks according to the film's format in theatre's (two types of formats were used in the original release, 35 mm & 70 mm. The 35 mm tracks were recorded first for national distribution while the 70 mm tracks were recorded for special releases. Rumor has it that these tracks weren't finished until the morning of the film's release).

In 1997, the original trilogy was released in theatres as Special Edition's. the negative for ""Star Wars"" was cleaned up with a few new scenes added among them:

The Stormtrooper squad that finds the droids escape pod is a lot bigger than in the original release. Overall, nice effect that either way doesn't kill the film.

Mos Eisley spaceport gets a big redo. Instead of the hole in the ground from the original release, here its a big spaceport complete with ships taking off & all sorts of new scum & villainy walking the streets. Overall, this was always Lucas' vision, but, again, due to time & budget back in the day he had to make due with what he had. Still, he didn't need to take out the werewolf creature from the cantina.

During the confrontation between Greedo & Han Solo, Greedo shoots first while the original shot of Solo firing is now a retaliation shot. The most absolute damning thing George Lucas has done to the moviegoing public (that includes ""Howard The Duck""). This basiclaly destroys some of Han Solo's character. This guy doesn't take s*it from anybody. But, with the tinkering of this shot, its now just in self-defense. It sucks anyway you look at it.

Jabba The Hutt makes an appearance (he was originally supposed to be in the film, but, due to budget & money constraints in 1976, he could never be fully realized). A fully grown Boba Fett is also present in the background setting up his bigger role in ""Empire"". Overall, cool effect & the scene was always meant to be there. But, Jabba looks a bit odd & doesn't look like the Jabba from ""Return Of The Jedi"".

Han Solo is chased by battalions of Stormtrooopers instead of five. Overall, funny effect, but, so was the original.

Certain dogfight scenes were replaced with CGI substitues to make the battle's more tight & fast. Overall, needed in spots & the battle is now more of a grand scale assault.

A new scene between Luke & his friend Biggs Darklighter has been added before the space battle at the climax of the film. Note: a line about Luke's father is cut. As Red Leader is about to speak to Luke & Biggs a crewman walks in front of the camera with Red Leader, saying ""You'll do all right."" The correct line is ""If your as good a pilot as your father was, You'll do all right."" Overall, nice scene that lets the viewer in on a little bit of the friendship between Luke & Biggs before his death.

For the 2004 DVD release:

A new Jabba The Hutt takes the place of the old. Overall, needed. The new Jabba looks more like the ""Jedi"" Jabba, and is better for it.

A 27 year old film gaffe is finally fixed. If you have an old VHS copy of the film, fast forward to the scene where just after Darth Vader cuts down Obi-Wan Kenobi, notice when the big metal doors close, take a careful notice to the color of Vader's lightsabre. Its rotoscope white, not the trademark red. That has finally been fixed. The other gaffe's haven't.

The audio seems a bit off. Whenever Vader speaks, his breathing takes a backseat while his voice is less synthsizory & has more tamber to it. John Williams' classic score is less booming in some scenes & I find that a real problem.
This probablly won't be the last release of the film on video.

""Star Wars"" is presented best in the widescreen format & is in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround & is THX approved with enough of ""The Force"" to wake the neighbors, & scare the dog.",1116979200,46,8018,4.571129707112971

380373,5,6301773551,"Star Wars was a film that not only succeeded as an entertainment but was a breakthrough. It was film that brought Science Fiction into the main stream. It also changed the role of female leads. Before Star Wars the role of the female lead in an adventure flick was to be rescued. To hang around looking tense until a male character sorted things out. Star Wars had a heroine who not only grabbed a gun and started shooting, but who was no stranger to control and exercising authority. The film also had one of the more original villains, Darth Vader.

At the time the films success was seen to be the result of state of the art special effects. But the reality is that on top of the effects there was a tightly written script with dialogue that contained some humour and wit. The musical score was also important in developing the mood of the film. It has one of the most effective scores since Siegfried.

Yet the success of the film lies in the plot density and the degree of invention and originality of scenes. If one looks at modern science fiction or action films it is unusual to see the degree of invention that occurred with Star Wars. Consider for instance the franchise competitor Star Treck. Star Treck films usually show a mock up of a space craft and then scenes set on something which looks like earth. Blade runner used the one set. Star Wars opens up in space but after that it does not stop. Lucas is a director who excels in tableaux.  With characters we open with Darth Vader but we quickly move on to two robots who will be the main vehicle for developing the plot. Shortly after we have a race of dwarf mechanics, sandmen and their animals, a bar full of strange musicians, a weird enforcer. The settings move from space to a desert planet and back to space. The visual variety of the film and the plot density more than cover any of the weakness of the dialogue.

The film is also set in a rational universe. A central government is trying to exsert control over what was once a less authoritarian system. It is using military force to subdue the parts of what was a republic so that an empire can be consolidated. The plot is centred on the deployment of a weapon so powerful that it can decisively tip the balance in favour of the emperor who we do not see but only hear about.  Of course it was unusual that the events which occurred so long ago in a galaxy so far away so mimic out history. The term emperor for instance was one invented by Rome's first emperor Augustus. He used it as a propaganda move to avoid the hostility to the term king. Princess is another one of Augustus' inventions but developed later to refer to an emperor in training after the Empire was split into a Western and Eastern Section. However one should not be to picky in looking at the semantics of a film.

It is interesting in the light of subsequent films that Darth Vader at this point does not seem that important. He takes orders from a character called Grand Moff Tarkin. Darth Vader has certain supernatural powers. He can strangle people through a thought process. However he is a person who appears to be on the way out. The other characters ridicule him in one scene and it appears a world in which technology is dominant and his skills are no longer in demand.

The end of the film was based on the battle of Britain. Lucas apparently used historical footage of second World War aerial dog fights to set up the last scene. It is a ants v elephants battle in which the ants through the use of careful targeting are victorious.

At the end of the film the empire's special weapon has been destroyed, one of he main characters who appeared initially somewhat self-centred has shown his devotion to a higher duty and all the plot strands have been tied up except for Darth Vader who has lived to set up a sequel.",1116115200,3,3825,4.423295454545454

I have read the reviews on line here at Amazon.com about ""Star War: Episode IV - A New Hope,"" some I agree with, others I don't. I was 2-years-old when this movie was released in the theaters so I had to wait till the television & VHS versions to see and remember that which I saw as an infant.

Still when I saw the original cut of this movie it was like WOW! The greatest movie ever and I was ecstatic when Lucas re-released it in the theaters. Those who complain about the re-cut of the movie were able to see this movie for the first time in the theater, those my age either do not remember or did not see it, and those younger than I were never given the chance till the re-cut.

One person complained that Mos Eisley was ruined in the re-cut because this person said that Lucas changed it from ""...the furthest planet from the bright center of the universe,"" to ""all the hustle and bustle of downtown Manhattan."" But this person fails to take in the fact that Luke was referring to Tattoine and that even on our planet we have places that are rather isolated but still have ports or airports that make a portion of it like a booming metropolis.

The re-cut was necessary for us in the younger generation after being spoiled by movies like ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and the ""Star Trek"" & ""Babylon 5"" TV shows & movies of the late 1980s through the 1990s. I for one am only really disappointed that Lucas decided not to include the original opening scene with Luke seeing the battle from Tattoine and then telling Biggs about it at Tosche Station (Mr. Lucas if you are reading this, this is a big hint for your next touch up).

I for one loved the updated scenes and the inclusion of both the Jabba scene and the Greedo shooting first scene - and no it is not the politically correct way of changing the scene as the same critic from before has stated - for if it was a politically correct change Han would have talked Greedo out of situation and the fact that Han had carefully removed his blaster and shot so quickly after Greedo is only indicative of Han trying to beat Greedo to the trigger - in essence both versions are self defense.

Nonetheless this movie is what began the Skywalker Family Saga and I whole hardily recommend this movie and also recommend that people watch only the wide screen versions and in a home theater atmosphere to get the most enjoyment out of this modern classic movie.",1110931200,6,2416,4.381696428571429
380410,5,6301773551,"I saw Star Wars in the cinema on its original release in 1977 and I was not slow to buy a ticket for an encore. The sheer experience of that film was exhilerating at a time when movie SFX were still a fair distance away from the quality we know and expect today. Few cinemas had stereo sound then because Dolby Stereo was in its infancy, and to actually be in a cinema so equipped at that time was a rarity. If you were really lucky, in addition to Dolby stereo, it might have a 70mm facility which would give you an enhanced picture, plus a 6 channel stereo split instead of the normal 4 channel of standard Dolby. Nowadays digital stereo in the cinema and home makes that sort of differentiating pretty irrelevent.

Seeing Star Wars in stereo and with its incredible effects really was an experience . After that sound and SFX were never going to be the same, and neither have looked back since.

Only just behind The Empire Strikes Back in terms of enjoyability sits Star Wars itself. The film remains one of those viewing experiences which just remains in your mind as a milestone. What effects, what imagination, the ability to lift you out of every day life and take you to a galaxy, far, far away. Who can forget seeing that opening shot of the huge Star Destroyer bearing down on Princess Leia's fleeing vessel?

No audiences had seen spaceships of those looks and dimensions on the big screen before...

The seedier side of intergalactic life is brilliantly realised in the depiction of THAT bar on the desert planet of Tatooine.

Of course you have that unforgettable sequence at the end of the film where a horde of tiny X Wing fighters take on the behemoth that is the Empire's Death Star.

Aside from the main characters you have great supporting roles. Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi is superb. As is Peter Cushing as the ruthless Governor Tarkin, commanding the Death Star.

As to the controversy of the editing that Lucas has made to the dvd releases, my feelings are as follows:

I loved the originals and have the vhs versions of all three. However, with nearly 20 years between Jedi and The Phantom Menace there were always going to be continuity issues concerning casting and SFX. Play an original vhs version of Star Wars, and you will soon see that the mattes have not aged well and stand out visibly. Yet did we notice them at the the time of the films release? No of course not because the SFX then were state of the art. Now with the passage of time and SFX having come on in leaps and bounds, George Lucas decided to update the former films. In my opinion he has done a good job too SFX wise. The casting editing is more to link with the newer editions of the franchise than to improve the quality of the originals, so my thoughts on that are mixed though. I can see the reason for doing it but I simply prefer the original actors in their roles. Clive Revill's Emperor in Empire Strikes Back I think is the deletion that was most unnecessary.

Overall though I am glad that I have a choice and can either watch the originals on vhs or put on the updated versions on dvd.

I have looked forward to the dvd release of these films for years and am delighted with finally being able to blast them across my home cinema set up. The picture on 16:9 anamorphic is great on a widescreen tv. All sound channels are crisp and totally clear of any distortion. Laser blasts and Tie Fighters shoot across the room to varying degrees...Such is the effect of being able to do that, it has returned me to the awe struck kid seeing Star Wars for the first time in a cinema. Thanks for the dvds, George, it may have taken a while but at least they are here now.",1107648000,6,3671,4.40117994100295

380412,3,6301773551,"Well, most people prefer The Empire Strikes Back, but I found it boring, it's just living off the success of the superior and more successful, ""Star Wars.""

This movie is good. No doubt about it. Grossed over $307 million in 1977, DESTROYING all other records, took home, I believe, 7 academy awards, and was nominated for 10. In 1997, Lucas reworked Star Wars. And made it crap.

Greedo shooting first is bad. Though some claims he shoots the same time Han does (not true). Han shot at many other things that did not shoot at him first, such as a stormtrooper in Star Wars, a Minoc, space slug, an officer on the Death Star, and hell even Vader's wingman in Star Wars. Why not just change all of this? I mean, Vader's wing man was just trying to protect Darth Vader, it would be CRAZY for Han to protect his friend and millions of others!

Even if Greedo DID shoot at the same time as Han (which he did not), he really sucks, and I am surprised Jabba would choose such an idiot Bounty Hunter to get Han. Even a Stormtrooper could hit Han at this distance! Han shooting first does not make him ""cold (blooded)"" --- it makes Han COOL. I think I would shoot at someone if they held a gun at me first. This change is so poltically correct it's not even funny. Worse change in the series.

Jabba the Hutt just repeats what Greedo told Han about. It's not good film making when you have 2 of the same conversations in a short amount of time. Worthless scene.

The Mos Eisley change is horrible. Here is a quote from Film Buff Online, [...]

""Originally Star Wars' Mos Eisley spaceport was rather unimpressive as a city, befitting of Luke Skywalker's complaints that his home planet of Tattoine ""was the furthest planet from the bright center of the galaxy. (...) The end result is Mos Eisley now has all the hustle and bustle of downtown Manhattan and Luke sounds like a kid complaining about living less than an hour away in the Jersey suburbs.""

And some of the music is changed. The music in Star Wars was THE best and George changed it. Well, if he wanted to change it now, why didn't he just do so back in 1977? Same with Greedo, why didn't he make Greedo shoot first in 1977? Easy: For the kids.

Anyways, even though the DVD changes are bad, the movie still kicks tons of ass. And this one (not Empire or ROTJ) will be remembered through history... well, the one that came out in 1977.",1104796800,5,2387,4.3724604966139955

380414,5,6301773551,"This film, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made.  Until this movie was originally released in 1977, most sci-fi movies were low-budget films with spaceships flying around on fishing lines with fake fire coming out from behind.  This movie changed all that.  In this movie, one gets to see awesome spaceships with colored lasers shooting at each other, as well as cool weapons like the light saber and blaster pistol, not to mention droids and strange creatures.

George Lucas' Star Wars vision has spawned five (soon to be six) classic movies that will remain classics for many years to come.  Fans such as myself will continue to watch them over and over with the same enthusiasm as if we were seeing them for the first time.  The characters have become household names; Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, R2-D2, C3PO, Darth Vader, etc.  Much like ""Gone With the Wind"" from the 1930s', Star Wars has stood the test of time and remains as popular today as it was thirty years ago.

Needless to say, I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The special effects are tremendous, but the story and character development is what truly draws the viewer in and never lets them go.  A camradarie develops between the viewer and characters, and we truly empathize with them.  There are also some new scenes in this edition, released in 1997 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the theatrical release, that are not in earlier versions, such as Jabba's visit to Han at Mos Eisley.

380415,5,6301773551,"SPOILERS AHEAD!

I first saw ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" when I was five years old. The final release of the original tapes had just been released, and my dad was quick to buy the box set. And as I watched the very first shot of the Star Destroyer chasing the Tantive IV, I was drawn in right away. The action, the characters, the plot... I could go on for days. It was the best movie I had seen in all of my limited years. And even now, eleven years later, the Star Wars Trilogy still holds a place in my heart as the best movies ever.

Two years later, Lucas gave his loyal fans a mixed bag from the Mall of America. He decided to release these classic films again in theaters - where they were always meant to be - but they weren't really the same anymore. You see (and you should if you are reading this), the movies that were released were what was known to Lucas as ""Special Editions"". These movies included enhanced special effects, new special effects shots, enhanced THX sound, and even some new scenes! This got a mostly bad reaction. Most fans were outraged at Lucas for tampering with their childhood in such a way. I suppose that, to those truly dedicated fans, this would be considered blasphemy. But these are George's movies, after all, and he can do what he wants with them (for my full speech on this matter, see my review of the ""Star Wars Trilogy DVD'S"").

In this review, I am going to cover all of the changes that George has made to the first movie in the trilogy, ""A New Hope"", and give them ratings. Enjoy.

-----

CHANGE 1 - Ride'um, Stormies.

The first major change occurs when the Stormtroopers are searching for the Death Star plans on Tatooine. Many new shots have been added of Stormtroopers riding on creatures known as Dewbacks (large, brown, lizard-like creatures). These new creations look cool all right, and they even manage to make the stormtroopers look realistic while riding on them. Overall, good job, George.

RATING: A

-----

CHANGE 2 - Got Danger? Not Anymore.

The first major change in the movie was the look of Mos Eisly. As the group of heroes enter the spaceport, several more shots are seen of a bustling town. These new shots include floating droids, dewbacks, and even a droid whacking another droid as it laughs at him. Unfortunately, these new changes dum down the seriousness of the moment, as they make the town seem more like a child's fantasy than a place crowded with the worst criminals in the galaxy.

RATING: C+

-----

CHANGE 3 - Pointblank Miss

The most infamous change made to ""A New Hope"", as well as the one most griped about by fans, is the fact that when Han meets Greedo in the cantina, Greedo now shoots at Han first, misses, and THEN gets blasted by Han. This was a very bad edit by George, even though he does explain that he did it so that Han wouldn't seem like a murderer. First of all, Greedo shooting at pointblank range, and missing Han just isn't good ju-ju (hence the title). Second, Han dodging the blast looked like crap, as his head only moved jerkily to the side. Bad Lucas, Bad!

RATING - D

-----

CHANGE 4 - Freaky Jabba

Another noticeable change was that a new scene was added after Luke and Obi-Wan left the cantina. This new scene comprised of Jabba the Hutt and Han talking about Han's debt in great depth (bad pun). All I can say about this is... God help us all. From what Lucas has said, this was a scene that was intended for the original version, but because of costs and the fact that effects weren't as advanced back then, it got cut. But putting it back in was a bad move by Lucas and the ILM company. First of all, the scene mostly repeats the dialog and main idea from the Greedo scene, and this makes it a little boring. Second of all, umm... what happened to Jabba? In ""Return of the Jedi"", he was a fearsome spectacle of slug. And even though he has not fully reached adulthood in this movie, that is no excuse for the job that was done on him. Jabba now looks like a pale frog with huge eyes, and an expression that clearly states, ""Why am I here? Why didn't I go to Florida instead?"". He hardly reacts at all to Han's actions and dialog, and overall looks like a piece of sh--- um, crap.

NOTE: The hilarity rating counts as how much I laughed at how crappy the scene was.

HILARITY RATING: A

RATING: E

-----

CHANGE 5 - Ummmm... Do I Know You?

Another change came when Luke and the other Yavin pilots were preparing for their attack on the Death Star. As Luke is getting ready, he is suddenly greeted by his old friend, Biggs. The two men have a loving conversation, and then get back to their business. On this scene, just look at the title. Luke only mentions Biggs once in the movie, and this is a passing phrase.

LUKE: ""Ah, Biggs is right, I'm never gonna' get out of here!""

Perhaps if we had a little more background on Biggs, we would have appreciated this scene more.

RATING: C-

-----

CHANGE 6 - Five More Minutes, please!

The final noticeable change was that in the charge on the Death Star, many new special effect shots have been added, including a shot of the Tie Fighter on one of the fighter's tail shooting him from behind, and a new and improved dive on the station. These new shots vastly improve the quality of the battle, and help to improve the tension of the situation. Yay, George!

380417,4,6301773551,"Let's face it,although a bit dated and flawed in places, the original Star Wars(aka Episode IV A New Hope) is a movie that broke the mold on movie blockbusters. Although slightly altered by George Lucas in recent years, it's still a fascinating movie to behold.
 Although hard to comprehend to younger movie goers, when SW first came out in 1977, it was a ground breaking movie with it's state of the arts special effects, which continue to push the bounderies over the past quarter century, and it's fast paced editing. Where most recent science fiction movies were dark, cerebral and apocolyptic,(2001- A Space Odessy, Planet Of The Apes, and Lucas' own THX 1138), SW was an all out action movie that featured heroes to cheer for(Luke Skywalker, Han Solo,Leia Organa), as well as villians to hiss at(Grand Moff Tarkin, and of course, Darth Vader).George Lucas referenced his characters on literary and cinematic classics.
  Lucas' enthusiasm for his work  brings out the weaker points of the movie. The acting and screenplay are a bit over the top(Luke's whining,Darth Vader sounding more like a mad scientist, than the sinister figure of Empire Strikes Back), and even the dialogue comes off as forced (Tarkin's foul stench?).
  The flaws are petty compared to the impact of the  movie, and the love from fans who would still wait in line for weeks until a new episode .",1096848000,,1373,4.892241379310345
380468,5,6301773551,"It's a pity that the Alan Foster book ""Splinter of the Mind's Eye"" never made it as a Star Wars film, and that George Lucas didn't take his own character's advice - ""You should never have come back!"" - because not only are his prequels colossal bores, featuring [so to speak] leaden direction, insipid writing and phoned-in performances, and John Williams's most uninspired music [no surprise, really, given the material he had to work with], but in his grandiloquence he bethought of himself to tinker with the original trilogy.  Or rather the original 2, since I have scant liking for the third/sixth movie I not-so-fondly refer to as ""Return of the Booboos.""  While in some instances the ""improvements"" were of a certain interest, others - particularly the ghastly corny overwrought ""pumped-up"" destruction of the Death Star - were more annoyance than enhancement, and it is truly a wonder that in the process of all that time and money spent on the project that Lucas did not deign to fix the error near the end of ""The Empire Strikes Out,"" which is the scene in which Vader inquires, ""Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millenium Falcon?"" wherein the characters were mirror-image reversed.  It must have been too trifling a matter for Emperor G's alleged greatness to consider, but a laughable oversight nonetheless.  Give me the original ""Star Wars"" and the revised ""Empire"" [since evidently that idiotic goof won't ever be fixed] - I could care less about which version of the ""Booboos"" I might have, since for me the highlight of that film was Lando Calrissian in command of the Millenium Falcon with that whoever-he-was in Chewbacca's place as they compassed the destruction of the Death Star East.  Considering the two strikes of ""Menace"" and the ""Clones"" with their dull-as-dirt titles and offputting character/place names, this ""Revenge of the Sith"" [it took 20+ years to overcome whatever trepidations there had been about that being the title of the ""Booboos""] holds no promise of the kind of rollicking good scifi fantasy entertainment the original two provided.  I can still at least hope that John Williams can climb out of his Dennis McCarthy-tainted spiral and compose a score worthy of his previous efforts, though it might well underpin another galactic yawner filled with the bland taste of George.  With anything approaching luck, that will be the last such we'll be subjected to by him.",1096848000,,2421,4.992555831265508
380469,5,6301773551,"I saw the original ""Star Wars"" (you can keep calling it ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" all you want, I do not have to go along with it) in a theater far and away more times than any other movie (low double figures).  I saw ""Star Wars"" as much as the films I saw the second and third most often in a movie theater, which would be, of course, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Return of the Jedi.""  I even sat through the movie twice in a row, the first time so I could pay attention to everything that happened in the lower left quadrant of the film and the second time so I could watch the lower right quadrant.

Watch the film again for the first time in several years three things stuck out in my mind as to why this film got us so excited way back when.  The first, as noted above, was how there was so to look at in this film.  Nobody ever laughed at the alien in the sunglasses trailing after the good guys at Mois Eisley, but in addition to the all the weird looking aliens in the Cantina and throughout the film there was the way this galaxy far, far away looked like it had been lived in.  The idea that the Millenium Falcon is not only the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy but actually looks like a hunk of junk mattered.  Even the wacky white armor of the Storm Troopers meant something to us, even if we questioned its functionality.  You could reduce Han Solo to his grin, Princess Leia to her hairdo, and Luke Skywalker to his light saber, because the costumes and art design were things we had never seen before.  Of course, Darth Vader being able to think people to death was pretty impressive.

The second is that if there is any one thing that made ""Star Wars"" move than a ""B"" movie made with an ""A"" budget it is the musical score by John Williams.  The composer had won his first Oscar two years earlier for ""Jaws"" and was also nominated for ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" when he won again for ""Star Wars.""  One of the things we did because we could not go and sit in the theater watching ""Star Wars"" all day was to listen to the double-album for the movie's soundtrack (yes, I probably listened to this soundtrack more than any other in history than did not require singing ""The Time Warp"" or any other song).  I do not know how much of the movie is scored to music, but it has to be an extremely high percentage, albeit short of what you would get with a silent film.  The only movie score that I find comparable is the one Ennio Morricone did for ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" especially in terms of have motifs associated with characters.

The final thing that made this movie great was the entire final sequence where the Rebels attack the Death Star.  The X-Wing fighters are still the coolest I have ever seen, despite what we have seen from ""Battlestar Galactica"" to ""Farscape"" and everything in between.  I would really love to see the complete original template George Lucas put together for the special effects crew spliced together from World War II movies.  Not only do we have the drama of the ""Dam Busters"" runs on the Death Star, but the sequences provides a number of memorable characters, most of whose names we never learn: Red Leader (Drewe Henley), Red Two (Dennis Lawson), Red Four (Jack Klaff), Red Six (William Hootkins), Gold Leader (Angus Mcinnis), Gold Two (Jeremy Sinden), and Gold Five (Graham Ashley).  Everything that happened was so vivid that when listening to the lengthy ""Battle of Yavin"" cut on the soundtrack I swear we could recreate every shot in our minds.

Perhaps the best way of describing the impact of ""Star Wars"" is to say that it must have been similar to what happened a generation or two earlier when Dorothy opened the door to Oz and the screen went from sepia tones to Technicolor.  It was an introduction to a whole new world.  Even if we never saw a Saturday morning serial we could appreciate the idea of a roller coaster type of ride where Sand People attack, the Millenium Falcon has to escape the Death Star, and the Rebel base is almost within range.

In terms of the controversy over the way George Lucas has tinkered with his 1977 film, I have already bought into the idea of the director's cut, so it is hard to fault the director for having a slightly different definition of that from others.  I remember how outdated the special effects looked three years later when ""Empire"" came out, so updating them makes sense to me.  The scene with Jabba sets up what happens in the rest of the original trilogy and I think the scene with Biggs before the attack is important simply because I think the idea that the last person killed is Luke's best friend.  Besides, I have the film we saw in 1977 preserved in a letterboxed edition on laser disc and can still watch it whenever I want.

Actually, what surprised me the most with this ""final"" version of the original ""Star Wars"" movie was how tacky the attempts by Lucas to retroactively fix his character's flaws.  To be clear that Han Solo is not a cold blooded killer Greedo now shoots first, although he is an incredible bad shot, especially from four feet away.  Then there was the shock that Leia no long kisses Luke on the lips ""For luck"" before they swing across that chasm.  Now it is a chaste little peck on the cheek.  It will be interesting to see what Lucas does with that early scene in ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" but I wlll find out about that tomorrow.",1096243200,4,5397,4.38855421686747

- Obi-Wan Kenobi reassures, Death Star killer, Luke Skywalker to keep the faith in ""Star Wars"".
George Lucas' sci-fi masterpiece, ""Star Wars"" changed the face of filmmaking forever, inspired future directors, and still, after two and a half decades, still generates legions of fans (I'm still a fan, since 9/77).
After his Uncle Owen buys two new droids (short for android), Artoo Detoo & See Threepio, young farmboy Luke Skywalker stumbles across a coded message of a beautiful girl hidden in Artoo's memory banks while cleaning him (""Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.""). Luke doesn't know who the girl is, but, who she refers to in the message might refer to an old wizard/hermit that lives beyond the ""Dune Sea"". Luke and the droids go in search of the old man & find him after having a savage run in with the local scavengers. Luke finds out that the old man is indeed Obi-Wan Kenobi and informs Luke that he's also a Jedi Knight and fought alongside Luke's dad in the Clone Wars, as a General.
Artoo replays the message for Obi-Wan. The message is actually a desperate plea for help from Princess Leia Organa of the planet Aldreaan. Her message states the Galactic Empire, led by the sinister Sith Lord & former apprentice failure of Obi-Wan's, Darth Vader, has a secret weapon called The Death Star (a space station that can destroy an entire planet) that is ready for use, & can bring great upheaval to the galaxy, certain victory for the evil Empire & certain death to the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom amongst the galaxy. However, stored in Artoo's memory banks are the schematic plans to the Death Star, that contains a major weakness that ultimately can destroy the station. Kenobi's mission is to bring the R2 unit to her father, Senator Organa, on Alderaan so the plans can be secretly delivered to the rebels. Unfortunately, Vader finds out about the missing droids (""Star Wars"" opens with the memorable and spectacular space battle above Luke's homeworld of Tatooine with Artoo & Threepio escaping there captured vessel and landing on the planet) and sends hundreds of Imperial Stormtroopers to search for them. The Troopers follow the tracks and inevitably follow them to Luke's homestead (Luke returns home to find the homestead burnt to the ground and the charred remains of his aunt and uncle). Luke, now an Imperial fugitive, decides to help Obi-Wan and to be trained in the ways of the Jedi & The Force, just like his father. The boys head to the local spaceport and book passage with Han Solo, Captain of The Millenium Falcon & his Wookie co-pilot, Chewbacca.
But, upon arrival to Alderaan the crew finds out that the planet is the first victim of The Death Star & Alderaan is reduced to nothing more than a meteor shower. The Millenium Falcon is then caught in a tractor beam by The Death Star and is pulled into the massive space station. Through some slick manuevering, the boys go undetected by the Imperial Forces and find out that in order to escape the battle station, the tractor beam needs to be shutdown. Obi-Wan volunteers to shutdown the energy beam at its source, while Luke, Han, Chewie, and the droids remain behind. That plan falls apart as Artoo discovers that Princess Leia is on board, being held as a prisoner with a stay of execution. Luke convinces Han, & Chewie to rescue the endangered princess while the droids stay behind awaiting Obi-Wan's return. The rescue is a success, but, Obi-Wan's past catches up with him as Darth Vader tracks him down through usage of The Force and through, the now legendary, lighsabre duel (a trademark in every ""Star Wars"" film) Obi-Wan Kenobi falls (and becomes one with The Force) by Darth Vader's blade. The boys with Princess Leia all meet up on board The Millenium Falcon and blast off from The Death Star. Unfortunately, a homing beacon is secretly stored on board the Falcon and leads the battle station to the rebel's hidden fortress. Through the classic final battle Luke joins the Rebel Alliance and learns that The Force will be with him always.
An awesome film and always a standout, ""Star Wars"" revived its dying genre (put it this way if it wasn't for ""Star Wars"", ""Alien"" would be first thought of as an illegal Mexican, instead of the space creature, ""Star Trek"" may have been a success but only limited to television, & ""The X Files"" would still be locked in a filing cabinet just to name a few). The film is steeped in mythology from around the world & has tons of characters (everyone has a favorite ""Star Wars"" character).
""Star Wars"" was released on 5/25/77 in 43 theaters,  has grossed 460 million dollars in the U.S. alone, has a place in The Library of Congress, is #16 on The American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time, & has been nominated for 12 Acadeny Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor & won 6 of those awards including Best Score, Sound, Editing, Set Direction, Costume Design & of course, Visual Effects.

This is the great original Star Wars, the 1977 movie in which the world first discovered the allure of The Force and the Jedi Knights. Young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Jedi veteran Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to rescue the gorgeous Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the sinister clutches of Darth Vader and the evil empire.
High space adventure, with creatures like Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the delightful R2-D2  (Kenny Baker).

380516,5,6301773551,"I've always considered George Lucas to be the Forrest Gump of Hollywood. He's an idiot savante who's somehow ""made it"" and become a household name. Prior to ""Star Wars"" he'd made two films of note, ""TXH"" (which I haven't seen) and ""American Grafitti"" (pretty average) and was flirting with box office disaster by making a ""sci-fi"" film.
A lot of people don't realize that ""Star Wars"" (theatrically released without the ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" subtitle) was made on a budget. It was these budget constraints that probably kept Lucas, with his affinity for short creatures (think Howard the Duck, Jawas and Ewoks) ""in check"" and turned ""The Star Wars"" into ""Star Wars"" and gave us a cultural phenomenon.
""THE Star Wars?""
Even less people know that as late as 1975-6, the vision that Lucas had for his movie was somewhat different from what we ended up seeing. See if you can download a copy of ""THE Star Wars"" script somewhere and see the subtle differences. One of the more notable ones was how much more ""THE Star Wars"" would have resembled a samurai movie. A lot of people accuse Lucas of doing Kurosawa-lite with SW when it came out. But Lucas' original vision had everybody running around with ""laser swords"" (lightsabers), even the Stormtroopers. Budget cuts cut down the number of ""laser swords"" to just a handful and that made them more special, not to mention a crucial story element.
The cast was trimmed down too. Luke Skywalker (or Starkiller as he would have been called) would have been just a supporting player, the brother of famed JEDI BENDU OF ASHLA Deak Starkiller. The cast would have included Luke's twins (including Leia STARKILLER) and R2-D2 would have spoken English!
Of course, this would have spelled utter disaster at the box office. Somehow you get the feeling that if anything had been different about ""Star Wars"" it would have tanked. Somehow it just works the way it is. The acting is shoddy, the plot is less than original and some of the pre-Special Edition FX look dated.
Still, despite everything that's wrong or average about it, ""Star Wars"" just plain works. I can't really say this with any kind of objectivity since this is THE first movie I ever remember watching. You'd get kind of attached to something like that, wouldn't you?
If I'd seen it yesterday, I wouldn't have gotten over the fact that CARRIE FISHER HAS AS MUCH RANGE AS A FRIGGIN' PORN STAR! But man, those X-wings look cool. My generation (and thanks to the Special Edition re-release, the next generation) has gotten the ""Star Wars"" bug.
And that's why George Lucas still has a job.",1072742400,8,2586,4.7616926503340755
380517,5,6301773551,"It's been over a quarter century since George Lucas (THX 1138, American Grafitti) first shared Star Wars with millions of awestruck moviegoers in the late spring of 1977.  Both the director and the studio executives at 20th Century Fox thought they'd have a modestly successful sci-fi/fantasy film with ""just okay"" box office receipts.  Instead, bucking their logic and lowered expectations, Star Wars became not only the biggest hit of its time, but it also launched both a multi-movie series and a huge merchandising/multimedia ""empire"" that made millions for the shy, unassuming USC film school graduate from Modesto, California.
Star Wars (later renamed Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope) begins with one of the most stunning opening scenes in movie history: After the 20th Century Fox Fanfare and a moment of silence for the ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" card, the Star Wars logo appears with the opening chord of composer John Williams' now famous ""Main Theme"" -- which serves as accompaniment to a title crawl that sets the stage for a battle between good and evil.  ""It is a period of civil war,"" and Rebels have united to challenge the evil Galactic Empire.  From a hidden base in the Outer Rim, the Rebel fleet has won its first victory against Imperial forces.  In the heat of battle, Rebel agents have discovered the secret plans for the Death Star, a huge space station with a planet-killing superlaser.  Now those plans are in the hands of Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and her starship carries her back to her home world of Alderaan with a huge Imperial Star Destroyer in hot pursuit.
It is the very climax of this pursuit that starts Star Wars: A New Hope with that indelible first scene of a small Rebel blockade runner being pursued by the huge wedge shaped Star Destroyer.  The Blockade Runner is tractored into the Star Destroyer's ventral docking bay, and after a short and furious battle, Imperial troops led by Lord Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice by James Earl Jones) overrun the ship's defenses and capture Princess Leia.
But wait! Just as the battle is ending, C-3PO and R2-D2, a pair of droids who are a comedic pair along the lines of Laurel and Hardy, have evaded capture and left the captured Rebel ship aboard a small escape pod.  Below them lies the desert planet Tatooine, with its twin suns, small farming settlements, and two persons whose destiny was inextricably linked decades before.
The first of these two that the droids will encounter is young moisture farmer Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a restless teenager who yearns for adventure and excitement beyond the confines of his Uncle Owen's (Phil Brown) struggling farm. With good mechanical skills (he modified his landspeeder on his own) and natural flying skills, Luke wants to follow his friend Biggs and enter the Imperial Space Academy.  But Owen and his wife Beru (the late Sheelagh Fraser) fear that Luke's dreams are much too dangerous, and Owen does everything possible to stall his nephew's ambitions. At first glance, one might think Owen is just a stubborn man, but when Beru points out that ""Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him,"" his earnest gaze and simple reply (""That's what I'm afraid of."") hint at things yet to come.
The other person of great import to the struggle between Empire and Rebellion is Ben Kenobi  (Alec Guinness), an old hermit who lives beyond the Western Dune Sea.  Considered by the locals to be a ""crazy old wizard,"" he keeps to himself in a spartan hut carved into the face of a cliff. But looks can be deceiving, for as Luke discovers when ""Ben"" rescues him from a band of Tusken Raiders, Kenobi was once the legendary Jedi Knight and General Obi-Wan Kenobi.
When Obi-Wan hands him an old lightsaber, Luke also discovers that his father had not really been a navigator on a space freighter, but had fought alongside Kenobi in the Clone Wars as a Jedi Knight.  ""A cunning warrior"" and ""the best starpilot in the galaxy,"" Skywalker the elder had been betrayed and murdered by a young former pupil of Obi-Wan's named Darth Vader.
After watching a holorecording of Princess Leia's plea for help, Kenobi then attempts to enlist Luke to take the droids to Alderaan with secret plans vital to the Rebellion, Luke hesitates. He wants to leave Tatooine, yes, but he feels an obligation to his aunt and uncle.
Alas, the long arm of the Empire has reached Owen and Beru first. Having tracked the robots to the jawas who had sold them to Luke's guardians, stormtroopers have slain the couple and orphaned Luke.  Now, fate -- or the Force -- has taken a hand, and Luke Skywalker vows that he  wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi.
Star Wars' second half, starting with the fateful meeting in the now famous Mos Eisley cantina with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and culminating with the climactic space battle over the Death Star, is a fast-paced chain of cliffhangers intended to be an homage to the cheesy-but-thrilling movie serials of the Thirties and Forties.  Will the Rebels get past the detention cell? Will the droids stop the trash compactor in time? Will Darth Vader face off against his former Master? Will Han Solo and Chewbacca go off to pay Jabba the Hutt, or will they save Luke during the last attack run down the Death Star trench?
Lucas' clever mix of various movie genres (Westerns, gangster films, sword-and-sorcery, and war movies), his pioneering advances in special effects, and John Williams' Academy Award-winning score are just a few reasons why movie audiences embraced Star Wars in such a manner that it became a part of American culture.  It's not perfect and it's hokey, yes, but it allowed many of us to forget (for two hours, anyway) all the troubles of the world.",1068336000,13,5782,4.772772772772773

380521,3,6301773551,"A film review by Vladredski rejects the conceptually flawed emotional polarities of ordinary reviews, and focuses on what in Truth matters to us all:  1) the film's Beauty, 2) the film's literal, analogical, and/or metaphorical treatment of Death, and 3) what the film should inspire a person to do if he or she could become Invisible and Travel in Time.  Star Wars.  What is beautiful about this film is that it can be ""seen as"" the nightmare of a dying Priest who, while wondering in the Woods pondering God, ate a poisonous mushroom by Chance.  For if one looks beyond the colorful characters, which remind me of food poisoning, one sees the classic Christian melodrama, rendered Catholic by its Baroque qualities, as well as characters struggling within the mystical binary of Good and Evil.  Within this, the figure of Darth Vader deserves special attention.  Our feelings toward him mirror the ambiguious feelings we have toward Satan in our real lives.  While we admire his power, and sense of style, we know that cultivating these feeling only leads to Hell.  Chubacca, a thinly veiled mockery of Saint Thomas Aquinas, is also an intriging character, though I think Mr. Lucas should have given him (or is it a her) a little more sophistocation.  Death.  Star Wars touches on Death in a least two very interesting ways.  In the familiar-seeming, yet different, world of Star Wars, what happens when a person dies?  I tremble when I think about this too long.  Second, do C3PO and R2D2 have Souls?  If not, why do they care what happens.  Invisibility/Time Travel.

380522,1,6301773551,"Hey, boys and girls, am I the only person who hates this stupid movie? I mean, what's the big deal? I first saw it after having heard people rave about it for months. Could this be better than ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the granddaddy of all? I found out soon enough. What a letdown! From the beginning things weren't promising. Right after the movie started there was a curious mumbling in the theater. It was at the point where words scroll on the screen explaining the setup, and the mumbling was that of parents reading it to their pre-school offspring. Wonderful. As for being ""science"" fiction, it manages to violate most of the basic laws of physics without even trying. For example, the characters run around in apparent normal gravity on a ship in space as if the vehicle were parked on a planet (which of course in reality it was).  And although there's no sound in a vacuum, we can't do without all those keen explosion noises and gunshots out in space, can we? When Princess Leia watches her home planet blow up, we not only hear it through space, but we hear it at the same time that we see it. Anybody who's watched a jet at high altitude fly across the sky knows that that ain't right. But enough of science class...The acting, except for Alec Guinness, is lousy, although I tend to prefer that of the snakelike creature in the garbage pit...This is stuff straight out of a comic book. Print science fiction matured beyond this at least as early as the 1930s. The scenery's impressive, though, and if I'm not mistaken, this is the very movie that inspired the now-sacred Hollywood rule: Throw money at the Special Effects Crew. I suppose if I'd been ten years old when I first saw this flick I might have thought it was really neat-o. ""Park your brain at the door, and you'll really enjoy it,"" they tell me. Believe me, I tried, but I'd need something more on the order of a lobotomy for that. I've also heard things like, ""George Lucas speaks to the kid in all of us."" Yeah, whatever.

380525,5,6301773551,"Watching this again recently I was struck by the traditional nature of the story telling. The film may be hi-tech, but the narrative is rooted long in the past. In particular, I noted several parallels between Star Wars and the plot of current blockbuster, Lord of the Rings.
Consider the similarities;
- Both Luke and Frodo have to leave their hearth and home to fight a menace they know little about
- Both are accompanied by companions who are steadfast and true, and just quirky enough to provide light relief after moments of high tension. In Luke's case he has the droids with their whistles and strange sounding voices, while Frodo has the slightly rustic Sam and the younger, enthusiastic Hobbits.
- Both come under the wing of old, swami-like tutors with strong mystical powers, a cantankerous nature and who are prone to say things like ""It is your destiny"" and ""The darkness is seductive"". And both mentors disappear out of the story just as our hero needs them the most.
- Both Luke and Frodo enter a bar filled with a strange amalgam of creatures from different places where people talk in strange tongues and where they meet a strong enigmatic man whose destiny is linked with theirs - Luke meets Han, Frodo meets Strider
- Both have something in their past that returns to provide a focal point in the story. With Frodo it is the ring left to him by Bilbo, with Luke it is his relationship with Vader, and the light sabre that Obi-Wan gives him.
-At the pivotal point in both stories, the hero stands alone with his fear, facing his greatest trial, before finally prevailing.
- And overriding the whole thing in both stories is the battle betwen the forces of light and darkness.
There are many more parallels but I don't want to give away too much plot on the off-chance that there's someone on the planet who hasn't seen it yet, But if you look you'll find other aspects of traditional storytelling lurking in the film, including some that have parallels, not in LOTR, but in traditional folk tales. Rescuing princesses, finding out about your true parentage and learning from wizened creatures in dank forests have all been standard fare for heroes for thousands of years.
I think that's the genius of it, and what made it such a must-see movie. It speaks to us in strong archetypes, with characters and situations we recognise from fairy tales from our childhood. Tolkein knew the power of the old stories, and drew heavily on them, and so too does George Lucas.
I just wonder if he read LOTR at an impressionable age?",1051228800,3,2537,4.665178571428571
380584,5,6301773551,"There's nothing for me here! I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi, like my father!"" Perhaps the best line ever uttered in a sci-fi movie. What can I say? This is one of the top five best movies ever produced, and the second best in the sci-fi genre, nipping at the heels of its paterfamilias, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", without which it would have probably looked quite different than it did.

How Lucas came from ""American Graffiti"" to this monster is a mystery. Though his love for sci-fi was quite evident in his first movie, ""THX-1138"", where did he get 1) The filmmaking acumen, 2) the money, 3) the technically adept people to pull ""New Hope"" off? This alone had to be a feat unequalled since Kubrick got together with Arthur C. Clarke and Douglas Trumbull to make ""2001"".

""New Hope"" had that magic touch that had you rooting for the heroes at every turn, predisposing you to this by painting the Empire as the very embodiment of evil....destroying Luke's home and BURNING Beru and Owen, blowing up Leia's homeworld and killing Obi Wan. By doing this, you cannot HELP but cheer as Luke and his rebel friends destroy Death Star in the climactic scene. You also can't help but chuckle at characters like Princess Leia, Han Solo and R2D2. Personally, I could have lived without C3PO in ALL the SW movies!, but he's present here too as the prissy opposite number to the much more useful R2.

Watch all three first trilogy movies...and you'll notice a DISTINCT change in the actors playing Luke and Leia. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher just BARELY resemble their ""New Hope"" selves in the succeeding movies! Mark Hamill's entire face seems to change from one with an aqualine nose and sun bleached blond hair to one with a pug nose, a much meaner mien to the entire face, and sandy BROWN hair. Carries Fisher's whole face goes from being round and pudgy to being elongated and gaunt, though she still pretty much resembles the ""New Hope"" Leia. Her voice, however, changes completely, going from tomboyish but still feminine in ""New Hope"", to being raspy and whiskey-soaked by ""Jedi"".

All in all, this is the one that sets the pace for the others, and is STILL the best one as far as pathos and pure edge-of-your-seat drama: The destruction of Luke's farm and the murder of his guardian Aunt and Uncle; the destruction of Alderaan by Grand Muff Tarkin; the trash-compactor scene; the rebel pilots being picked off one by one by the Empire fighters during the Death Star run by Luke's friends. The last minute save by Han Solo...this film couldn't have been a more perfect matinee entertainment if it tried!

Special mention has to be made of Sir Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing, especially Cushing, who gave perhaps his best film performance ever in this film as the supremely evil Tarkin. The sad thing connected with this film is the lackluster career Mark Hamill has had since ""Jedi"". Though he was, hands-down, the star of what was for quite some time the most popular film ever, he couldn't give himself away by the mid-eighties.

The fickle fortunes of Hollywood, I ask you.....",1051142400,,3100,4.678899082568807

Back in 1977, George Lucas transported movie goers into another world for a little over two-and-a-half hours, and you weren't the same when you walked out of that theater. Aside from the special effects looking a bit dated, and the fact that Harrison Ford takes a little while to get into character (his acting in the early scenes is reminiscent of William Shatner) the rest of the movie is as capable of taking you away as it was almost thirty years ago.

380586,5,6301773551,"The staggering success of ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones"" motivated me to watch ""A New Hope"" for the first time.
I was reluctant to become a ""Star Wars"" fan after growing up devoted to ""Battlestar Galactica,"" but I can safely say I've come around.
From a narrative standpoint, it's difficult to compose a summary of the saga--because it's being told out of order. Key developments occur in Episode III, which hasn't been released yet! ""A New Hope"" is the fourth film in the series, but it was actually the first one to be made. This was a bold choice by the creator, a talented man named George Lucas. You have to watch three other movies before getting any explanation of ""the Force,"" but this contributes to the mysterious, etherial nature of a Jedi Knight's power.
I liked this movie a lot, but I feel like I've skipped ahead by watching it, so I'm not going to see ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Return of the Jedi"" until after Episode III comes out. I don't want any more surprises to be spoiled.
Familiar characters from Episodes I and II appear, including Obi-Wan Kenobi (he's called ""Ben"" in this film), R2-D2, and Jabba the Hutt. Obi-Wan Kenobi is much older in this film, which indicates that a long time has passed since the Clone Wars. A new main character is introduced, named Luke Skywalker. Since his last name is the same as Anakin Skywalker's (from the first two episodes), and he lives on Tatooine with Owen and Beru (from Episode II), I'm guessing that Anakin is the lost father that Luke repeatedly refers to. Apparently, Luke's father was killed by the villain Darth Vader, which I'm guessing will happen in Episode III.
Darth Vader is a good villain, though he doesn't fight as well as Darth Maul (from Episode I), and he talks a lot more. Apparently he was once a pupil of Obi-Wan's before he turned to evil. I'm guessing that young Boba Fett, angry that his father Jango was killed by Jedi in Episode II, pretends to be Obi-Wan's pupil along with Anakin, then reveals his evil intention (all this would happen in Episode III). That's why Master Vader wears a helmet (Jango Fett wore a helmet).
It's fun to see Jabba the Hutt again; I liked him in Episode I. He appears in a scene with a new character named Han Solo (a young Harrison Ford!), because Solo owes him some money. There's an earlier scene where Han Solo is confronted by, then shoots, one of Jabba's bounty hunters, but it doesn't add anything to the story, and I like the Jabba scene better. Plus another character with a helmet like Jango Fett's appears with Jabba. I'd be willing to guess that it's Boba's son (or a clone), who will end up helping Luke and Han fight his evil father. Maybe he's a spy, or something--keeping an eye on Tatooine.
C-3PO also returns, but doesn't seem to remember Tatooine...which is strange because I didn't know he'd ever left! It must happen in Episode III, and his memory gets erased, or something. I'm sure George Lucas has it all worked out; the ""Star Wars"" saga is a carefully planned tapestry of relationships and events.
""A New Hope"" is pretty good, although the some of the special effects look a little out-dated, because they weren't done with CGI. It's a little strange that a few decades have gone by since Episodes I and II, but everything looks older instead of newer. I guess this is meant to underscore the hardships that people face living under the rule of the Empire.
Luke and Han team up to save a princess who's been captured by Darth Vader, and we see the final results of the ultimate weapon hinted at in Episode II. So, Luke finds himself getting the excitement he always wanted, and he makes new friends along the way.
For the most part, I don't like the new characters as much as the people from the first two Episodes. Princess Leia is an uptight, crabby re-hash of Queen Amidala. Han Solo has a sidekick named Chewie, who attempts to be as funny and likable as Jar-Jar Binks, but doesn't even come close. And Han Solo cracks a lot of jokes, which takes away from the seriousness of the situation.
Still, it's a well-done sequel--almost as good as the first ones...and I can't wait to see the next two (and the one right before it)!",1049500800,,4186,4.560424966799469

The film has an attitude to it.  A little arrogant and a little sarcastic, but still thrilling and and made the foundation for almost every action and fantasy movie to follow.  Only the recent release of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy has had near that much impact (which I consider this generation's Star Wars).
George Lucas was at his creative peak in the ""Hope,""  and it shows.  The special effects are used to help paint the world in which the characters live.  They don't distract and they don't  take away from the actors' performances.  The trench run with the Death Star can still live today with modern special effects laden scenes.  And the actors are so convincing in their roles, unlike some in the prequels.  Alec Gunniess leads the cast with his Shakesperian wisdom, and the cool Harrison Ford is just , well, cool.

380590,3,6301773551,"Star Wars - Episode IV, A New Hope is an entertaining, if rather dated, voyage into the mysterious depths of outer space.  Unfortunately films of the science fiction genre tend to age quickly due to rapid advances in technology (as evidenced here by some very static inter-ship battle sequences).  However, the essence of the film remains unchanged, and modern viewers are just as likely to feel uncomfortable in the presence of the black and foreboding Darth Vader as audiences of 25 years ago.
Vader belongs to the Empire - a consortium of power-hungry and remorseless warlords whose aim of galactic domination is threatened by the theft of some secret plans.  Enter young Luke Skywalker, who - with the aid of smuggler Han Solo, Princess Leia, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, a 7-foot Wookie, and two incredibly camp droids - must ensure these plans reach the rebel base and are used to destroy the Empire.
The setting gives the designers free rein to create some imaginative non-human beings, and these range from the sublime (such as the majestic yak-like Banthas used as desert transport) to the ridiculous.  A collection of people wearing masks reminiscent of department store Halloween costumes does not make for a very convincing inter-species frontier town.
Apart from this, and the almost unbelievably abysmal target accuracy of the bad guys, there is a lot to like about this movie.  The characters are clearly defined, and although ostensibly the story is spearheaded by Mark Hamill, it is Harrison Ford as sarcastically laconic space cowboy Han Solo who carries the film.  The passage of time may have slightly dimmed the power of the light sabers wielded in the battle between the Force and the Empire, but they are by no means extinguished.",1036800000,3,1752,5.0034364261168385

The most wonderful thing about the movie is that it is hardly boring, and a thoroughly well-crafted spectacle. Also it is not all about 'I kill you, you kill him' kind of crazy action flick. For an action movie, the amount of violence is surprisingly less.

It starts when Luke Skywalker, a young boy who never remembered his mother, and believed his father is dead, finds two delightful droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO.  He fixes up some stuff on R2-D2, and then goes out into the ouskirts of his village.  There he is knocked out by the Sand People, but is rescued by the 'thought' dead Obei-Wan-Kenobi, or Ben Kenobi, as Luke calls him.  Obei-Wan tells Skywalker that he knew his father, and that he wanted Luke to own his blue lightsaber when he was old enough.  They suddenly find out that the Imperial Empire knows that they are there, and Luke races back to his village, only to find the worn skeletons of his uncle and aunt. The evil Darth Vader has sent some of his Imperial Troops down to Luke's planet, Tatooine.  After a close encounter with some of the troops, Obei-Wan leads the group to Han Solo and Chewbacca, the Wookie.  Just before they leave Tatooine, Han encounters Jabba the Hutt, for the money that he had to pay.  Soon they escape from Tatooine, and find out that Darth Vader has constructed the Death Star.  Before long they find Princess Leia captured by Darth Vader, and they fight their way toward her.  Obei-Wan goes his own way, and fights with Darth Vader face to face, with his lightsaber, but he dies, and Luke and the princess leave with Han Solo.  They go to their hidden base, and get X-Wings to take siege upon the dreaded Death Star.  Luke Skywalker gets a vision from Obei-Wan, and destroys the Death Star, and Darth Vader blasted away in space inside his Imbound Squadron, twirling around in circles from Luke's shot.

380658,3,6301773551,"Well, it seems I am one of those very few over the age of 30 who is immuned to the charms of the Star Wars saga.  At the time of its release in 1977, I was only 9 years old and frankly, didn't even feel the need to see it then.  And as the years went by, I saw the phenomenon grow into strastospheric proportions.  Frankly, I was scratching my head in amazement the whole time, wondering what the heck the fuss was about.
  For some reason, I was never attracted to this saga even as a kid, having only seen bits and pieces of it.  And I was able to suffer through the whole thing only a few days ago.  It felt like some school assignment to me more than anything.  I had tried to watch it several years prior to this but just found it too boring for words and gave up.  But finally, I was curious and vowed to myself that I would at least see the whole thing.  There is something there for sure, otherwise it wouldn't have endured for as long as it has.  And after that first viewing, I can say that Star Wars is everything the reviewers have described...  First, it is not a great movie by any standards with bad acting, childhish plot developments and cheesy special effects.  True, they were very innovative for 1977 but compared with today's technology, they stand no chance.
  Although I was mostly bored while watching, I can recognize Star Wars as the true classic it really is.  And even though I have to admit that I don't like this movie personally, I can totally understand why it has a tremendous lasting value to this day.  The film has become a fixture in time, an icon attached to a pre-computerized era.  People who saw it at the time of its original release are truly the ones who felt that impact the most.  They had never seen anything like this before.  The movie had just the right blend of fantasy, special effects and story twists to capture the imagination of a whole generation of moviegoers at a precise time in history where it was badly needed.
  This said, I can totally get why many young people out there don't understand its appeal.  Children and young adults of today have seen much better movies with complex, intelligent storylines and mind-boggling special effects.  In a sense, they are used to the perfection digital technology allows nowadays which didn't exist back then.  When you compare it to ""The Matrix"" for example, it seems painfully lame and pointless.  And it is true that with time, Star Wars has acquired a cult status so gigantic that it has transformed it into an highly overrated monstrosity with probably too much hype to overcome.  But if you allow your mind to be transported back to 1977, you will be more able to understand why this movie is still reverred this way even today.
  The film struck a deep chord in many people at a crucial time in history and was able to create a whole new space-oriented universe through movie-making we now take for granted.  We have to remember that Star Wars was one very important pioneer in the sci-fi genre and it is unfair to compare it to movies being produced today.  It is in a class all its own and should be looked at from the standpoint of its place in cinema history.  I agree with some reviewers who state that George Lucas is somewhat overrated as a storyteller, his ""Phantom Menace"" fiasco being the ultimate proof.  But back in 1977, when Star Wars hit the theater screens all over the planet, George had somehow succeeded in giving the public its first taste of a fantasy world so appealing that its impact is still vivid today, transforming our movie culture forever...",1011484800,3,3581,4.476851851851852

380703,4,6301773551,"""Star Wars"" represents the fourth chapter in Lucas' stellar space opera, subtitled ""A New Hope"".  The movie as a whole is very entertaining.  When you put into perspective that the technology they used, while state-of-the-art at the time, was limited, the storytelling was done to a key.  ""A New Hope"" introduces us to the movie industry's most popular characters, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Han Solo, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Darth Vader, in an epic battle against oppression.  The film stretches across intricate worlds, bringing us to Tatooine and Yavin as the Rebel Alliance figures how to dismantle the Empire's most sinister weapon, the Death Star, an object of destruction.  To this day, while the visuals show their age, the idea behind this epic fantasy is completely original and ahead of its time.  It mimics our society through space-age technology and a flashy sci-fi setting, while presenting before us all-too-familiar morals and situations that come right from the pages of an illustrated storybook.  ""Star Wars"" is still a legend in our time, special edition or not.
I greatly appreciated Lucas' attempt to theatrically revive the three films.  Just being able to witness them on the big screen for the first time would've been enough, but the revised special effects added to the excitement, as fresh details made for a more diverse, more modern type of film, while still retaining everything that made it great in the first place.  The main reason I flocked to see it was so I could witness the enhanced footage of Han's confrontation with Jabba, as this prospect had been talked about for some time among fans before ILM decided to put it back in.  I agree, it didn't do much to enhance character development, as the overall conversation takes place with Greedo just moments before inside the Cantina; nevertheless, it only adds to the fun.  And while at the time I didn't think Star Wars needed a Special Edition, the updated Death Star battle was a welcome surprise.
The only thing the new effects may hinder is the fact that, a lot of people want to look back at the special effects of old.  I personally find it difficult to revert to the original version having seen the Special Edition, as it's much more polished.  At the same time, the updates don't detract from an already great film, and if anything, it makes the transition that much more easier when you experience the prequels.
By no means is ""Star Wars"" perfect, but it started the legacy over twenty years ago.  And like I said, new footage or not, nothing keeps a good story down.",997401600,8,2590,4.8568181818181815

The three movies of the Trilogy that is.  It's always been Nose and Nose with StarTrek as far as Fan Hysteria has gone, but Star Wars always captured the crowds and brought in mega bucks.

Kinda like what Sony and Square did with Final Fantasy, Lucas did with StarWars.  (To the 10 year old reviewer... It was a kid but it was over a bowl of cereal, no cookie... apple juice, maybe).  If you haven't seen this movie by now then where have you been?  I'm not blaming your but you've missed a few rungs on the ladder here... Star Wars bridged and advanced so far in its day that Movies went where they never had gone before (like the first Scifi to take place BEFORE the present)  You can't rate this movie thinking today, or comparing it's qualities against modern times... it's a CLASSIC and like any classic it's already been rated... why do you think the darn thing is still around?  You can't say it's better than this or worse than that because no duh.

Matrix, more than likely, Sixth Sense, definitely, Green Mile, don't know quite yet, Titanic... already forgotten.  Star Wars... oh yeah.  It's still a household name after more than 20 years.

But the vision is centered on simple people who suffer this tyranny but who are in contact with  the force . They are thus able to go beyond the surface of things and to use the balancing forces of the universe that the Empire negates. Then this first center connects us to the rebellion against the Empire, a rebellion that is seen as a monarchy of some symbolical value, particularly a Princess. The second interest is the fight between this Davidlike rebellion and this Goliathlike Empire, and the rebellion, with its little means, but its enormous personal investment and courage, a bunch of heroes ready to die to assert and give some future to the rebellion, is thus made victorious and it can destroy the normous war-machine of the Empire : the gnat is stronger than the lion. This makes us feel that this rebellion, in spite of its monarchical aspect, is the real representative of the American ideal : to fight for justice and freedom, through personal commitment. We can think of the model that lies behind : the fight against Nazi Germany, Hitler and fascism. We could also see the model of the fight against a certain type of communism represented by the Wall or the Iron Curtain. We must also note the vision of this intergalactic world as being an assemblage of very different  people , species and subspecies, within a  market  economy where everything has a monetary value, but a wild market-economy where violence is at times the best way to  buy  something. Yet the mercantile and mercenary pilot hired by Luke and his friends becomes a hero... Hence ideals are successful in the end.

The special effects are spectacular (even though the film was made in the '70s when there really wasn't a lot of new technology for special effects for movies). George Lucas wrote a fantastic screenplay for the perfect movie and the music by John Williams is a total masterpiece, too.

380760,5,6301773551,"Star Wars has everything you could possibly want in a film.  The story is set amidst a battle of good against evil, the plucky and righteous forces of the republic versus the evil and sadistic forces of the empire.  The good guy is a young good looking dreamer who just wants to join the battle for democracy, while the bad guy is a black clad half-human half-robot with dark powers, and with the classiest face mask you've ever seen!  It's got a love triangle, sword play, dog fights in space, humour, torture, a great escape, old enemies fighting to settle an ancient score.... it just goes on and on!
But on top of all this stuff of classic stories, it's also a great science fiction story, with dorky robots, exploding planets, lightsabres, spaceships, big furry aliens, not to mention the deathstar and the force!
Star Wars was the first really big science fiction film, and led the way for all the other great sci-fi that came along in it's wake.  Just think of Terminator, Alien, Close Encounters, Predator, Jurassic Park, not to mention the resurgence of Star Trek and the resultant flood of sci-fi on tv.  Star Wars made sci-fi into a marketable commodity, and boy did it take off in a big way! It's not often you can point to a specific turning point in popular culture, but that's exactly what Star Wars was.
But for me, though, it was the first film I saw in a cinema, a present for my tenth birthday.  Perhaps it's a bit wimpish to call it magical, but that's what it was!  Everything was so cool!  A couple of things really stood out though.  Light sabres - surely the coolest weapon ever.  Darth Vader - a baddie you could really sink your teeth into, all that black leather, the cape, the mask, the voice.  Wow!  R2-D2 - a robot's robot, cute, funny, but clever and steadfastly loyal.  Suddenly, every kid was covering cardboard tubes with tinfoil and having mock battles, or else breathing funny and trying to strangle people by pure force of will, or maybe just whistling and tootling a lot!  I was already reading science fiction by then, but to see it come alive on the screen, so realistic, the effects so good (they still look good even now), the story so interesting, it was just a dream come true!
Star Wars is an excellent film, a classic of science fiction.  The effect it had on popular culture, and especially on science fiction in the cinema and on tv, will never be surpassed.  If you haven't seen it by now, well it's not too late.  Watch, and prepare to be a kid again.",970444800,,2501,4.497787610619469
380761,5,6301773551,"Plain and simple, Star Wars is the undisputed lord of cinematographical SF&F. Just like Lord of the Rings: some people hate it, others point to  different things and say that they like them more, but, really, no movie in  history had the impact on popular culture and the entertainment industry  that Star Wars had ever since its release back in 1977.
We all know the  semblance of the plot that Star Wars: A New Hope has: Luke meets Obi-Wan.  Luke and Obi-Wan meet Han. Luke, Obi-Wan, and Han go to the Death Star and  save Princess Leia. Princess Leia leads Luke to the rebels. Luke blows up  the giant..... of course, I can't tell you the ending. I can tell you,  however, that the plot is very thin. What saves the film, what gives it its  magic, is the great, life-like characters who behave like real people, who  dodge the fake-seeming laser blasts as if their lives depended on it. The  dialog is especially great. And, what's particularly amazing about Star  Wars is that the ""comic relief"" characters are actually tasteful  and particularly likeable.
The aliens are, without a doubt, outstanding  (save for the computer generated ones). There are many of them, and each  has a peculiar language of its own. I lose myself trying to describe their  appeal.
The sets fit in well with the plot and look very realistic -  probably because they are indeed real. There is no more alien place than  Earth itself - and Star Wars proves it. The shaky, unstable camera that at  times shows only a part of what is going on gives the film a sort of  life-like credence.
Star Wars: A New Hope is the beginning of the entire  Star Wars saga, whereas Episode I is instantly identifiable as a sequel.  Here, every character starts anew, with a life of his or her own. Each  earns our trust. Each will live forever in public memory.",969408000,3,1824,4.561728395061729

This movie allowed the movie Alien to be made because  before they had no knowledge of how to make the Alien but Star Wars: A New  Hope made it happen.  The characters were well played from Uncle Owen to  Darth Vader to Obi Wan Kenobi, to bad Sir Alec Guiness died a few days ago.  Some people say i was slow but what do they know, it was extremely  interesting learning about Luke, Leia and Han.  I find it odd though that  Tatooine was a place nobody went to or knew about (except smugglers of  course) but some how Luke and Friends always end up there.  The begining  scene with the Imperial Class Star Destroyer shoting at the Corellion  Corvete was amazing it was a great opener to show the people what Star Wars  is all about.

The opening war on the princess' ship is really good  and Darth Vader's first impression on us is very good (he manages to mildly  scare us). From then on all the scenes on Tatooine are cool (and sad when  Luke's Aunt and Uncle are killed). I love Luke's ironic line to Ben when  the old Jedi tells him ""You'll have to sell your speeder."" Luke  says ""That's OK, I'm never coming back here again."" INDEED. I  wonder if he remembered that remark when he went back there in ""Return  of the Jedi"" to rescue Solo. All in all, I like the Special Edition  version better. The new scene with Jabba doesn't help, because Jabba's new  computer image looks stupid next to his evil image in the last movie. I do  like the scene with Biggs they added. I also like the neat special effects  they added to Tatooine (it reminds me of the Tatooine I liked off  ""Phantom Menace"") and they really spruced up the fight with the  Death Star in the end. I would recommend you watch the Special Edition just  for this first episode in the Trilogy. The others look good in Special  Edition or original.",963014400,,1249,4.346320346320346
380788,4,6301773551,"I would like to start by saying that ""Star Wars: A New Hope""(I  hate calling it that) is definitely a fantastic movie in its original  format(the original theatrical release). It is still a great movie with the  ""Special Edition"" revisions added to it but both versions have  flaws that cannot be overlooked(regardless of age etc. and the amount of  years that passed since its original release. With absence the heart grows  fonder) ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" starts off with an interesting,  exciting scene involving the capture of Princess Leia but then it slows to  a crawl for a good spell while it introduces us to Luke Skywalker and  Obi-Wan Kenobi.(Attention span has its limits folks) The movie then gets up  to speed when finally we meet Han Solo and Chewy. Then the suspense and  drama kicks in and the rest is a fabulous ride that is action packed(not a  total frenzy of special effects) complete with a certainly priceless amount  of bickering between Han Solo and Princess Leia. The interactions between  the characters are what made this movie what it is.(Though some of the  acting was awful. ""That's no moon. It's a space station."" I  cringe every time I hear Alec Guiness say that) The climactic ending is  everything that fantasy is about. The farm boy got his chance to make a  difference and did. By believing he could do it he took on the empire and  took out the ""Death Star"", thus saving the rebellion. The  ""Definitive Vision""(Special Edition) was hit and miss for me.  Some of the enhancements were very well placed while some seemed out of  place. The extra footage that was originally edited out(The conversation  with Biggs before takeoff near the end) should have stayed where it  belonged.(Not in the movie) It added nothing except time to the movie. In  short, ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" is simple enough for kids yet  complicated enough for adults if you are into fantasy and science fiction  movies.  You know, something scares me about hearing ""George Lucas's  Definitive Vision of ....."" before the movie starts. It seems to be a  lot like you might start a session of hypnotic treatments.

380790,5,6301773551,"I saw Star Wars: Episode I in theatres before I saw this.  Episode I was a movie I really enjoyed, in contrast to some.  About a week after that, I saw the original.  My first impression was that it was too long and it  needed more action.  Everyone can come to the same conclusion after  watching Episode I.  It is really fast paced, and has much more action.  But this one - the original really grew on me the next time I watched it.  I reallized there was great character development, an even pinch of comedy,  and much depth - all things I wasn't really looking for after watching  Episode I, which has all that too, just alot less.  I saw how the  characters in Episode I matured to become what they were in the trilogy.  The original opens up when the Empire lives.  Princess Leia, a person from  the senate, has stolen plans for a huge Imperial space station called the  Death Star.  The Empire's agent, Darth Vader, fears the princess might find  a weakness and destroy the station.  So he attacks her ship in order to get  the plans back.  But Leia puts the plans inside a droid and sends it, along  with another, to Obi-Wan Kenobi - a used-to-be-general for her father.  However, the droids fall into the hands of a farm boy named Luke Skywalker  first.  Determained to get the plans to Obi-Wan, the droid runs away from  Luke, who follows it.  Luke ends up meeting Obi-Wan, finding him to be a  Jedi Knight.  Obi-Wan invites Luke for Jedi training.  Later, Luke accepts  and the head for Leia's father with the droids.  Han Solo flies them to the  Death Star accidentally and they rescue Princess Leis from the station.  Later, in a spectacular arial showdown, Luke flies in a fighter against all  odds and destroys the Death Star.  The movie following this one is what I  think is the best - The Empire Strikes Back, due to the best character  development and action.  I still think this movie is a little too long, so  I like Episode I best next, and then the one following ""Empire"" -  Return of the Jedi.  Don't get me wrong, I love all the Star Wars movies.  I think most of you would like ""Empire"" best also.  But all of  them are definetly worth buying, and if not that, watching - trust me.",959644800,,2208,4.380597014925373

380844,4,6301773551,"When I first saw Star Wars, I was but 6 years old.  The nightmares would follow for 12 more years.  When I saw Star Wars again, I was 18 years old and more prepared for it.  Now that I see it again, I kind of like it.  Of  course its directed by George Lucas.  It might have been better if John  Hughes were directing.  In fact, Star Wars is almost like Home Alone.  George Hammil was a blond kid left all alone, Maculy Culkin was a blond kid  left alone.  Coincidence?  I think not.  Anyway, the aliens, special  effects, and what-not are pretty state of the art seeing as how it was made  in 1977.  I also take it you saw Episode 1.  (Which only insulted this  movie even further.)  So all-in-all this is a good movie you should  definitly purchase.  If you want inside infor for Episode 2, it's George  Lucas sitting in a directors chair laughing into the camera for 2 hours.  I  think that'll win an Oscar, don't you?",948412800,,921,4.22093023255814
380845,4,6301773551,"Ah, Star Wars. Hate it or love it, it's a movie that everyone has heard of. Let's get started
First of all, it is not THE BEST MOVIE EVER!  or worthy of any similar award. It's a fuin to watch neat movie. It's got a  cool story and is unique in many ways, but in many other ways it's not. It  took a lot from Dune and a whole lot from one of Akira Kurosawa's movies.  (George Lucas even admitted this in an interview sometime a while ago). The  biggest problem with this movie, besides it's obvious hokiness, is George  Lucas.
Everyone knows he's a bad director (anyone seen Phantom Menace?)  The scene where the storm trooper hits his head on the doorway is a classic  (watch for it when the stormtroopers enter the room where C3PO and R2D2 are  hiding) And George Lucas is a HORRIBLE writer. He can make good stories,  but he can't write screenplays at all. 'Aren't you a little short for a  stormtrooper?' The two Star Wars movies with the worst writing were this  one and Phantom Menace, and they are the only two that George wrote the  whole thing himself for. Just like Indiana Jones, the only one of those he  did himself was the second one, and it's by far the worst.
Overall  though, it's a good movie, and it's fun to watch. Definately not the best  movie ever, but fun. And about the special edition: Although it was fun to  see some scenes originally intended to be in there, a lot of the new  sequences were stupid, out of place and side-tracking. George Lucas tends  to release things in a hundred versions though, so it's no surprise",948153600,2,1548,4.368421052631579
380856,5,6301773551,"What can you say about the movies that started it all.  I've been a Star Wars fan & collector for 20 years now.  This is where we REALLY first learned about Harrison.  Forever the movie to compare others to, not some  nudity boat movie.",947808000,,236,4.295454545454546
380857,5,6301773551,"A young hero, a captured princess, a hot-shot pilot, cute robots, a vile villain and a heroic and mystrerious Jedi knight blend together with marvelous special effects in a fantasy tale about rebel forces engaged in a life or death struggle with the tyrannical leaders of the Galactic Empire. One of the biggest blockbusters of all time, this movie set a new cinematic standard for realistic special effects; making many pre-STAR WARS effects seem almost laughable in retrospect.",947635200,,479,5.153846153846154
380858,3,6301773551,"It's been very amusing to read the other reviews that  people have written for this film. People who love ""Star Wars"" say that people who hate it have no imagination. People who hate ""Star Wars"" say that  people who love it are geeks. As for myself, I am neutral. I don't care  either way. I DO have some opinions though.
First of all, this is not  the best movie ever made, nor is it original. George Lucas owes a debt to  the great H.G. Wells for how Star Wars looks. The costumes are influenced  by that 1936 film ""Things to Come"", based on Wells' futuristic  novel ""The Shape of Things To Come."" The same applies with the  clean, bright decor and flashing lights.
""Star Wars"" is  basically the story of King Arthur retold in a futuristic setting. The  lightsaber is the SF equivalent of Excalibur. (Both weapons involve a  mystical ""force"".) Luke Skywalker is  Merlin's apprentice, in  this case represented as Ben Kenobi.
I myself believe many of the ideas  for ""Star Wars"" came from ""Dune"": the young hero with  mental powers, the evil Emperor, that sense of a time so far in the future  it feels like a long time ago.
Many of the pictures I paint are of  futuristic scenes. When people see them, they assume I am a big ""Star  Wars"" fan. I assure you I AM NOT. But ""Star Wars"" is now  such a firm part of our culture, it's a natural thing for people to assume.  I don't hate ""Star Wars"", but I'm not one of those people who  knows the script off by heart either. I prefer films like ""A Clockwork  Orange"", ""The Terminator"" and ""12 Monkeys"". These  kind of films leave me thinking afterwards.
""Star Wars"" is more  of a harmless adventure yarn. Great visuals, simple plot, and a sense of  child-like wonder. It's a nice, old fashioned idea of good versus evil.",947203200,7,1764,4.4375
380859,5,6301773551,"This is the movie that started it all. The most groundbreaking sci-fi that is truely a landmark of it's time. This is the epic story of good and evil with plenty of special effects and action. Although not the best fim in the  series, it is the mother of them all. Director and creator, George Lukas  does a splended job of telling the story of young, soon to be jed-knight  Luke Skywalker. Truely remarkable!

It continues to captivate its audiences, as I witness my nephews now caught up in its imaginative, accessible story and  engrossing characters.  While I still prefer the version without the  special improvements, as they were, this movie will always deliver.  It is  the perfect popcorn adventure, with dashing leads, a swashbuckling sci-fi  story, lots of fun stuff to pepper the proceedings, and a symphony to  underscore it all.  Good vs. evil, and guess who wins?  The ending, which  feels like the finale to a big musical, has you grinning from ear to ear.",945907200,2,659,4.692982456140351

Even if no sequels were ever made, this film would be a classic.  While I don't think it is quite as  good as Empire Strikes Back, it is a close second.  I first saw this film  in 1977 when I was 8 years old.  Luke Skywalker embodies the dreams and  desires of all young men who want to break out of their provincial  surroundings and experience the wider world (or in this instance, the  universe itself).  Alec Guinness is perfect as Obi Wan Kenobi, and with  Peter Cushing, provide Star Wars relatively young and unknown cast with a  solid veteran presence.  Star Wars - A New Hope strikes the best balance of  all the Star Wars films in its appeal to both children and adults.  I just  have one curious observation though: when the Rebel pilots are shown  getting ready for takeoff, they're all wearing brand new blue striped white  helmets, yet during the attack on the Death Star, they're all shown wearing  multicolored helmets that look like they have been kicked around a lot.",942364800,,1105,4.517766497461929

This original Star Wars movie -- unlike a certain  modern prequel -- doesn't get so enamored with special effects and visuals  that it loses sight of the characters.  You truly come to care about Luke,  Han, Leia, Obi-wan et al.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is that  the movie does lose something on home video.

At 13 in that year I thought I would see  much more of this to come but I have been disappointed ever since by the  lack of imagination Holywood has had in its use of special effects.

It's one of the greatest movies ever made, it ushered in a new cultural phenomenon that has lasted to this very day, and it's groundbreaking special effects have paved the way for modern technology to flourish. There is too much to say about Star Wars, but we will focus today on the original 1977 version, no special edition version because Han does not shoot first, among other things. So Star Wars, if you've been living under a rock for almost 40 years is an epic sci-fi saga set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away centering around the journey of Luke Skywalker becoming a Jedi. We'll get to the story of the prequel movies soon. So why is this movie above all others my favorite movie of all time? Well it being the first movie I ever saw makes a huge impact, and it making me the happy geek I am today makes a huge difference. I shudder to think who the hell I would be if I never saw Star Wars at the age of 2 or 3. I am the biggest Star Wars fan you will ever meet. No seriously I can quote this whole movie from beginning to end...with sound effects and music included! I have seen it that many times! I love it so much, I have such a huge passion for it even after all these years, it's unbelievable. I love the story, it's concepts, it's ideas, it's technology, it's planets, everything! The characters are unforgettable, we have Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker who has this very simple life but is thrust into action led by a wise mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi played masterfully by Sir Alec Guiness,on their travels they meet a smuggler Han Solo played by Harrison Ford and his copilot Chewbacca played by Peter Mayhew, and are accompanied by two robots C-3PO played by Anthony Daniels and R2-D2 played by Kenny Baker who have to go save Princess Leia played by Carrie Fisher from the evil Galactic Empire headed by Darth Vader played epic-ally by both David Prowse and James Earl Jones and the sinister Grand Moff Tarkin played beyond perfection by the incredible Peter Cushing. Seriously it is because of Darth Vader that I always wanted the villain to win in every movie when I was a kid, because the villains were way more interesting than the heroes, and made me the evil Sith Lord I am today. I could write a 300 page essay on Star Wars, but I will try and keep this short. The dialogue is so quotable, I think almost 100% of what I said when I was a little kid was a quote from Star Wars. The music is perfect, this is John Williams best score ever and it still gives me goosebumps and almost brings tears to my eyes. It's very difficult to describe the appeal of Star Wars for me,it's really just something you will have to experience for yourself if you haven't seen it already. And if you have seen it before, what are you doing reading this? Go watch Star Wars! It may not be a perfect movie, but I love it more than any other movie ever.",1526256000,,2897,4.3076923076923075
