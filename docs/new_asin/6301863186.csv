379759,4,6301863186,"Despite its inclusion in the Fox Film Noir series, ""House of Strangers"" has more in common with ""King Lear"" than it does with ""Panic in the Streets"" and ""The Street With No Name."" Still, it flirts with noir through casting. Stars Edward G. Robinson and Richard Conte have frequently walked the dark, rain-swept streets of that anxiety plagued genre which generally focused on society's underclass.

""House of Strangers"" tells the story of an Italian immigrant barber who finds his fortune in banking. But success comes with a heavy price as his tyrannical ways alienate his sons, three of whom let their father twist in the wind as his kingdom crumbles due to mismanagement and unethical practices.

Although Philip Yorden receives sole credit for the screenplay, film historian Foster Hirsch, who provides an insightful and entertaining commentary, insists the script was primarily the work of the director, Joseph L. Manckiewicz. The acidic tone of much of the dialogue does suggest it written by the man who brought us ""All About Eve"" the next year.

The cast is superb with Robinson brilliant as always, but it is Luther Adler as Joe, the eldest son and the most conniving, who offers the standout performance. His scene with Conte in the restaurant is a textbook example of fine acting. Susan Hayward is good, too, but her part is rather superfluous, added for box-office purposes rather than dramatic necessity.

""House of Strangers"" is fairly obscure these days, and is probably best-known for having inspired the 1954 western ""Broken Lance"" with Spencer Tracy and Richard Widmark, but it stands tall on its own merits and is well worth seeking out.

379760,5,6301863186,Gino Monetti (Edward G. Robinson) is the toast of his enclave in Depression era New York.  He runs a loan company that doles out cash to customers with no collateral.  Who cares that he charges usurious rates.  His sons abet him in his thriving business and fall neatly under his iron thumb.  Then the feds come calling.  All the resentment and deceit that had been percolating for years rises to the top and favorite son Max(Richard Conte) has to take the fall.  Director Joseph Mankiewicz has crafted a terrific film about how the sins of the fathers visits wrath upon their sons.  Edward G. Robinson does a terrific turn as the ever smiling patriarch with arsenic for blood.  The underutilized Richard Conte is his equal or better as the son who has to the suffer the slings and arrows of the charade that the Monetti house of cards was.  I remember seeing this film years ago on Cinemax and anxiously awaited it's DVD release.  Just because a film is relatively obscure does not detract from it's greatness.,1158537600,3,1011,4.661016949152542
379761,4,6301863186,"""House of Strangers"" is based on the novel ""I'll Never Go There Again"" by Pulitzer prize-winning playwright and novelist Jerome Weidman, who wrote about the immigrant experience in New York City in the early 20th century, particularly the Jewish immigrant experience. This screenplay is credited solely to Philip Yordan, but director Joseph Mankiewicz actually wrote the final version of the script. Jerome Weidman's book is about a Jewish banking family who were changed to Italians for the film. If that was in order to avoid controversy, it didn't quite work. The Giannini family, who founded Bank of America, complained to 20th Century Fox that the family in the film resembled theirs. But they were outdone by the studio chairman himself, Spyrus Skouras, who thought the fictional Monetti family was his. So he limited the film's release. That's unfortunate, because ""House of Strangers"" has some wonderful performances, including one that earned Edward G. Robinson a Best Actor award at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival.

Seven years after he went to prison for attempting to bribe a juror, Max Monetti (Richard Conte) returns to New York with vengeance on his mind, directed at his brother Joe (Luther Adler), whom Max believes gave the police the tip that put him away. His old flame Irene Bennett (Susan Hayward), a sharp-tongued uptown girl, wants Max to abandon thoughts of vengeance and start a new life with her. As Max listens to his deceased father's opera records, we travel back in time to when family patriarch Gino Monetti (Edward G. Robinson), a poor barber-turned-rich-banker, held his immigrant clients and his 4 sons under his sway. -Except for Max, whose forceful personality made him his father's favorite, immune to the petty abuses and selfish whims suffered by Joe, Antonio (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.), and Pietro (Paul Valentine) . When the State investigated the bank's lending practices, the bitterness that Gino's ill treatment had sowed became apparent.

""House of Strangers"" is sometimes called film noir, probably because of Max's subjective, introverted perspective of the corrosive Monetti family dynamics. But this isn't even a crime film. Its strongest elements by far are Greek Tragedy, but ""House of Strangers"" is also part immigrant experience and part romance. The sins of the father are visited upon the sons, and the 3 main players in that drama -Gino, Max, and Joe- are memorable. Edward G. Robinson's performance is a bit theatrical, but Gino's character is so poisonous and his emotions so vivid that it doesn't matter if he is over-the-top. His lecture about the differences between the Old World and the New is a hoot too. Luther Adler impresses in the small but delicate part of Joe, the scorned son. The interaction between Max and Irene seems superfluous, as if it were transposed from another story. A lot of dialogue that was unmistakably written by Mankiewicz comes out of Irene's mouth. There is some good stuff, but Irene talks too much. ""House of Strangers"" is a fine Greek Tragedy and a harsh take on an immigrant family that made good.

379762,5,6301863186,"Superb. I can't believe I had not even heard of it, hopefully this DVD release will help it find a new audience and some deserved critical acclaim. It's billed as film noir, but it really isn't; it's more an extremely complex, suspenseful family drama. But that doesn't even do it justice. The screenplay is terrific, subtle, thoughtful, and at the same time, razor sharp. Some of the exchanges between Conte and Hayward in particular are electrifying. Talk about two `tough cookies' that ignite when they get together. And you really begin to care deeply about what happens to them. (All of the acting is top notch, across the board.) And then there is the direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. The movie is so beautifully crafted and feels as if it could have been made yesterday, it's gritty and urban and fresh. The composition in the movie has deep meaning in just about every shot, and is gorgeous to behold besides. Watch this movie.",1155081600,29,937,4.754601226993865
379763,5,6301863186,"This is a film I'd only caught TV fragments of, decades ago.  I'd watched enough back then to know I wanted to add it to my home collection, but I held off buying the videotape version because the video was available at an outrageously high price.  I've come to appreciate the voiceover commentaries Fox provides on many of its re-releases so, when Fox announced it was making a reasonably priced DVD of it available, I pre-ordered it a month before its release.  The movie itself is excellent in every respect.  The commentary, though, is not up to the usual Fox standards.

The commentary complains that Susan Hayward's character doesn't fit the femme fatale prototype for noir and thus she has too much screen time.  However, as commentary on other Fox noirs has pointed out, the supportive ""good girl"" love interest is as much a part of the noir tradition as the wise-cracking torch singer; and clearly Hayward's role was (expertly) expanded to augment her star development, much as was done somewhat earlier for Lauren Bacall in THE BIG SLEEP.

Hayward's savvy dialogue imbues her character with the sassy edge one expects of a noir femme fatale, suggesting that she's a capable match for the protagonist in the boudoir.  But the commentary misreads the scene where her lover (Conte) reacquaints himself with the sexual atmosphere of her apartment after a seven-year absence.  This is not a tense, foreboding mood (especially in contrast to the menacing gloom when he enters his parents' ""dark old house"" in the sequence that follows this one), as he pockets her lipstick kiss on a discarded tissue and then nonchalantly slips out of his clothes to take a shower.  And Hayward's leer and self-hug when she realizes who has broken into her bedroom and is naked in the next room leaves little doubt about the extent of the reunion that takes place between the slow dissolve and the next scene we share with them.

Robinson clearly deserved an Oscar for his performance as the patriarch--his fluid Italian, his courage for a couple near-nude scenes, and his characteristic good acting, especially when he'd get that trademark thrush in his voice to convey deep emotions.  And, of course, this is the supreme Richard Conte picture.

I was puzzled by the music used for the final shots of the movie.  I knew I'd heard the music somewhere, but the DVD commentary merely continues rattling on plot description.  I checked the other credits of composer Daniele Amfitheatrof and, though impressed by his list of accomplishments, found no other film title that matched up with that fade-out music.  Only while writing this amazon.com blurb did I recall that it's the same music that ended the Fox classic THE RAZOR'S EDGE three years earlier.  Amazon.com lists that film's director as the composer of the music for EDGE; but, while Goulding did write the popular songs for that production, the theme at the close of EDGE and of HOUSE is by Alfred Newman.  Looks like Yordan (instead of director Mankiewicz) taking credit for the script of HOUSE OF STRANGERS is not the only cover-up associated with the Mankiewicz movie.

HOUSE OF STRANGERS doesn't ""feel like"" a noir film to me.  Conte's protagonist is not really an anti-hero, is always a confident professional rather than haunted with self-doubt and hunted as a victim of legit society.  Part family drama and part gangster picture, HOUSE lacks such noir staples as fancy nightclubs (though the speakeasy depicted economically conveys a seedy noir clientele); thug beatings that result in the hero being bandaged by the vapid good girl who believes in him; or a sense that the whole world (not just his brothers and his father's ghost) is out for the hero's blood.  Yes he makes a bad choice and is jailed for it, but this plot detail does not exploit the usual noir wormwood.  And yes, the story suggests such devices of Greek tragedy as hubris and inescapable Fate, but without the ""cold city"" lewdness the genre so often prefers.  Ultimately it's KING LEAR (with two weak middle sons subbing for one of Lear's thankless daughters) meets THE GODFATHER.

This DVD's big disappointment remains the commentary.  Amid patches of silence, occasional observations state obvious ways that the framing and editing advance the plot.  But that shouldn't detract from the five stars this movie deserves.  Full-blown noir or not, just skip the voiceover commentary and enjoy the film as is.",1150416000,41,4429,4.932614555256064
379764,4,6301863186,"""House of Strangers"" commences with Richard Conte playing disgraced lawyer Max Monetti visiting his three brothers Joe, Tony and Pietro in the bank that they own.  He's just been released from prison and apparently has vengeance on his mind.  After his less than cordial call he proceeds to return to the now deserted family homestead.  He has a flashback and we learn what has caused his predicament.

Conte's father is Gino Monetti played with complete aplomb by the incomparable Edward G. Robinson.  Gino Monetti is as old world Italian immigrant who elevated himself from being a poor barber to a rich banker on New York's Lower East Side.  Robinson was not wise to the banking laws and would loan money to people without collateral and at unregulated usurious rates.  He eventually was investigated and brought up on charges.  Lawyer Max came to his rescue being the only son of four that rated his father's respect.  His brothers had been berated and treated poorly by Robinson, who felt he had good reason to do so.

The three brothers did nothing to help at the trial and things were going badly.  Conte took a chance and attempted to bribe a juror, got caught and imprisoned for seven years.  Meanwhile Robinson had his bank stolen from him by his sons and lived out the rest of his days embittered with hatred in his heart.

Conte's gorgeous girlfriend Irene played by the stunning Susan Hayward waited for him all those long years and seemed to be the tonic that would allow him to start life anew and forsake his brothers.

Director Joseph Mankiewicz did a nice job coordinating the heated interactions between his characters to create a story of a once close family torn apart by jealousy, resent and greed.  The Romanian born Robinson makes the whole movie with his very convincing portrayal of an old school Italian complete with accent and mannerisms.",1135814400,10,1867,4.808777429467084
379765,4,6301863186,"HOUSE OF STRANGERS is a cautionary film about the dangers of hatred being passed onto the next generation almost as if hatred were an old and unwelcome pair of shoes. Edward G.Robinson is Gino Moretti, a self-made banking magnate who built his fortune as a ruthless moneylender who chose not to observe the usual niceities about observing normal banking regulations concerning records and collateral. In his over the top performance as an Italian who might have been Vito Coreleone had the Don chosen to go straight, Robinson is a totally self-centered egomaniac who comes off more as a smug Biblical patriarch holding court over his captive family than he does the old-world banker who believes that his money gives him rights that transcend filial obligations. It is hard to like him as he rips into his four sons, insulting each of them in ways that undercut whatever sense of independence and goodness that otherwise might have been there. It is only Max (Richard Conte), who can see,if only belatedly, the vision of his father. And even Max learns that he must purge himself of the bitter dregs of poison and animosity that afflict his brothers. Max cannot do this alone; he requires the understanding first of Maria (Debra Paget) then later Helen (Susan Hayward), both of whom act as leavening agents that continually remind him of the goodness that each is sure lies within. Gino Moretti is truly a vicious inverted father figure in whose futile bleatings to his ungrateful sons,""Who do you think I built this bank for?"" generates no pity in them but rather a sense of loss in us that he probably heard the same empty words from his father. The difference between the utter tragedy that this film was just a hairsbreath away from and the modest sense of optimism that it does end with is probably no more than what may, in similar real-life situations, have emerged. What goes around truly comes around, and HOUSE OF STRANGERS continually reminds us of the truism of that cliche.",1050796800,16,1986,4.826979472140763

379865,3,6301863186,"House of Strangers, 1949 film

It begins with a view of a New York City street crowded with pushcarts (small businesses that are now obsolete). Max returns to the Monetti bank after a seven year absence. His mother moved back to Mulberry Street from their big house. Can Max get his seven years back? Take the money. Will he move to San Francisco to start a new life? The scene changes to earlier years when Gino Monetti was alive. There is a crowd by his bank. Gino makes a loan to a man who needs a new horse. A woman wants $62 to send someone to Denver (to fight TB). Max lends money for bail, Gino doesnt like these men. Max is a trial lawyer who defends the accused. Say please. Miss Bennett does so.

Joe has a complaint about his treatment by Gino. The family dines formally together (Max is late). Then Max gets a telephone call at night. Miss Bennett wants him to work in California. One some boxes as an amateur; he loses. We see personal conflict among the family. The New World is different from the Old World, Gino says. [Note their behavior.] Later Max goes out with Miss Bennett to a local tavern. [No cigarettes for sale.] Regulators want to check the banks records (its 1932). Miss Bennett drops Max. There is a problem, the Government closed his bank. Gino lent money on character, not on collateral. Gino didn't keep accurate records, its misapplication of funds. In a crisis old resentments flare up. Who will take the rap?

The new banking law creates problems. Gino testifies how he started in banking. There is conflict. Can one juror be influenced? Max takes a risk. [Was this a set-up?] Gino signed the bank over to his wife, and she sold it to the three sons. Gino wasn't convicted but he lost the bank. Gino tells who told the police. His lifes work was taken. Theyll pay says Max. Miss Bennett asks Gino to stop writing letters. Max is allowed home for a family visit. Max makes a sign. His mother is alone now. Will Max take revenge on his brothers? He still has Irene. His brothers talk to him about his future. More. There is conflict at home. Joe repeats his fathers advice and shows his character! Did he misread Pietros character? Max leaves for a new life.

This was adapted from a Broadway Stage Play. It shows the background of life before the 1930s, when any successful business owner could start his own bank. There were no Federal or state regulations, like after the New Deal banking laws. Lending out money that cant be collected was one of the causes of the Great Depression (like the losses on Collateralized Debt Obligations in the early 21st century). People bought financial products and got less that expected. So who profited? The failure to regulate CDOs was one factor in the current Great Depression. So too sending jobs offshore to impoverish working Americans (but which made a tiny group super rich). Ross Perot warned us in 1992, but how many believed him? What will either major political party do? Nothing; they are owned by those who profit from the present situation, just as the super rich own most of the media (newspapers, radio, television, etc.).",1411603200,,3111,4.589928057553957

What a talent, the only person to win back-to-back best picture and director Oscars, for All About Eve and Letter to Three Wives. His name attached to a film virtually guarantees high quality.

379918,5,6301863186,"""House of Strangers"" I saw many years' ago and was pleased to be able to buy it.  It's an engrossing tale of a family done in flash back style from Richard Conte's view point as he has just been released from gaol after seven years and has returned to the family home which is not lived in any more.  Edward G Robinson is excellent as we've come to expect him to be in the varied roles he has played on screen.  His is/was the father of four sons each with their own views on life being affected by the dominance of their father.  Mother while not a necessarily down-trodden person does not have much say in the family being an ""Italian Mamma"" and expected to run the house and cook but she is so saddened by the turn of events that occur with her husband and sons.  She has remained in my mind long after I watched the film.  Luther Adler, always a pleasure to watch and is a fine actor, is the eldest son; the other sons are played by Efrem Zimablist Jnr (I hardly recognised him from his later TV ""77 Sunset Strip"" role) and Paul Valentine as the less intelligent brother who was called a ""dumb-head"" by his father and at the end of the film this expression is the dominant factor in what happens to them all.  Father on his deathbead has imbued Richard Conte with hate and to take revenge at previous occurences between him, the father and his other brothers but Richard has met Susan Hayward, a beautiful woman and actress, who makes him see reason and to let the past just rest in peace but before this can happen, the feelings of the the brothers are quite intense and have to be dealt with before the film finishes.
I recommend this film to lovers of old films and particularly of the 1940s and 1950s.  It's classed a ""film noir"" but I don't think it is as there is a fine distinction between film noir and other films of the period that seem to be the same.  It's essentially a story of the break-up of a family caused by the old-fashioned attitude of Italian father Edward G Robinson.

379956,4,6301863186,"Inhabiting the nebulous area between family tragedy and film noir, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ""House of Strangers"" is grim, compelling stuff. Edward G. Robinson is marvelous as an Italian-American banker who bullies his family and his customers, all the while imagining himself Santa Claus in the flesh. (Robinson won Best Actor at Cannes for this, and deserved it, but today he'd never be allowed to get away with the Chico Marx accent he uses here.) Equally good are Richard Conte as Robinson's favored son, who pays dearly for that status; Susan Hayward as the femme fatale Conte falls for, against his family's wishes; and Luther Adler as Robinson's despised eldest son, who is not above a little treachery to get back at his father and brother.

""House of Strangers"" never quite reaches the level of intensity it could have; probably, audiences in 1949 wouldn't have stood for it. However, Mankiewicz's smooth direction, matched by the excellent actors and the snappy dialogue in Philip Yordan's screenplay, makes this film rewarding entertainment. Except for the original trailer and a bland commentary track by a film historian, this disc has no extras.",1380326400,,1156,5.148936170212766
379957,4,6301863186,"Like many in this Fox Noir series, House of Strangers is borderline noir at best, but it's still one of my favorites in the set. The first few minutes, which frames the flashback body of the film, is absolutely superb. There are beautiful street scenes before we are thrown into the main conflict with no information, gradually learning through dialogue what the situation is. The transition to the flashback portion itself is absolutely wonderful. We then get to the the meat of the story itself, and while the photography and direction (by Joseph Mankiewicz) and characters are marvelous, the details -- particularly the emotional details -- of the story just don't quite click for me. In particular, the hot and cold romance between Richard Conte and Susan Hayward has an odd dynamic for me. Still, all the other elements of the film -- including some hard-boiled verbal exchanges that come close to parody at times -- pull me in. Edward G. Robinson is dominating as the father -- I believe he won Best Actor at the Cannes Festival for this one -- but I agree with a few other reviewers that his Italian accent (""Hey, rubba my back."") is rather over the top. In addition, the story is mostly set in the 1930s but has a late 40s feel to it. (In passing, if I have the story's chronology right, the Richard Conte character should get out of prison just about the time that World War II is starting, but there are no wartime references at all.) However, despite these flaws, it's a truly engaging picture, one I can watch over and over for the reasons stated earlier. Recommended.",1368921600,,1580,4.666666666666667

I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It's kind of noir, but Susan Hayward is so awesome, she kind of storms the sarcophagus and rescues Richard Conte. (I realized later that part of why I love this is that format, kind of Sleeping Beauty in reverse.)

The other reason I love it is its a treatise on the bright and dark sides of family dynamics. As Freud said 'there is no individual psychology, and almost nothing's been written about Groups.' This is a fascinating meditation on the group, that is not as simplistic as it might seem.",1361145600,,719,4.480916030534351

Trouble brews and the sons jump ship only the 1 son sticks by his father's side and vows revenge on his brothers! Think you know it all because I said this...you don't! You haven't a clue.

Classic line from ""House Of Strangers"" --- When one of Robinson's errant sons declines to help his father during his trial - ""I'm sorry pop I don't want to stick my neck out"" to which Robinson wryly inquires ""Why - what's so good about your neck"".

As usual, Edward G. gives a bravura performance, this time as the domineering patriarch of his Italian clan --- I believe his performance received a well-deserved award at Cannes that year --- Conte and Hayward, both of whose careers are ripe for re-evaluation and rediscovery, match him every step of the way --- Noir at it's best.

379965,5,6301863186,"With strong acting talent like Edward G. Robinson and Susan Hayward, you can't go wrong. Here, both flex their acting muscle. Hayward, like Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck, eschewed wimpy, damsel in distress roles and is her usual strong independent woman in this. She had excellent posture and distinctive carriage which exuded confidence. She could enter a scene and steal it with her walk--head held high and shoulders back.

380006,5,6301863186,"This is a terrific, tough-nosed film. Edward G. Robinson plays, of all things, an Italian immigrant who, through hard work and an indomitable spirit, has made good as a bank owner. But he has also become a tyrant who browbeats and belittles three of his four sons. He only gives respect (and love!) to one favorite son, played by Richard Conte. When the feds descend on Robinson and his bank because of questionable practices, his beleaguered sons exact their revenge and turn their backs on him. Only Conte stays true, and ends up taking the fall for his father in the form of a 7-year jail term. The whole thing plays out as a flashback following a painfully intense scene between the brothers at the bank when Conte visits following his release from prison. He's bent on revenge, and his brothers know it. Even the gorgeous Susan Hayward cannot deflect Conte's thirst for vengeance. Following the flashback the drama between the brothers plays out, with the ghost of their tyrannical father swirling thickly around them. Will anyone win? Will anyone survive?",1245801600,,1061,4.867403314917127

Edward G. Robinson once again plays a role made for him. I'm amazed at how often he's played these types of characters but yet they all are their own man, they don't seem streamlined into one person.

The tension the father creates between the brothers, seems so subtle at first, masked behind small jabs the father seems to consider ""kidding"". But, as the years go by all the brothers pretty much hate each other as much as their father. It's surprising that one of the brothers actually makes such a huge sacrifice for his father by going to jail for him.",1237161600,,766,4.3125

380011,2,6301863186,"I don't blame myself for assuming that ""House of Strangers"" would be a hard-hitting, insightful portrayal of the dysfunctional American family, this based solely on the story line and list of contributors: Joseph L. Mankiewicz at the helm, directing the great Edward G. Robinson along with Richard Conte and Susan Hayward. Fact is, the assumption isn't entirely wrong. It's just not entirely right either.

The plot in a nutshell: Robinson plays Gino Monetti, first-generation immigrant and heavy-handed family patriarch who works his way from modest means to successful banker while raising four sons. When his books don't balance, his second and favorite son Max, played by Conte, takes the fall while the others stand aside and watch. They are unwilling to sacrifice for the man that subjected them to years of torment and psychological abuse -- you know, calling them ""stupid-head,"" refusing salary raises and the like. As Max stews in prison, his hateful father feeds his imagination with thoughts of revenge. The story starts immediately upon Max's release as he confronts his brothers in their father's erstwhile bank. The remainder, up to the end, is told in flashback.

The transition from present to past is brilliant. Max returns to the now-abandoned family home. He puts an old record on the phonograph and drifts to sleep beneath the imposing portrait of his father. The camera pans, and in what seems to be a single shot, dollies up the grand staircase, past billowing curtains, through the upstairs hall, and into the upstairs bathroom. We are introduced to Gino Minetti, singing as he bathes. His voice rises above the recorded music which fades out from the future. Fantastic.

Despite the fact that this film stands as a testament to the cinematographic skill of Mankiewicz and Milton Krasner (who also worked alongside Menkiewicz as cinematographer on ""All About Eve"") it suffers from critical flaws, not least of which is Philip Yordan's heavy-handed script, completely devoid of any subtext. Add to this the fact that key cast members, or rather mis-cast members, flounder through scene after scene grasping for direction while spouting campy, over-the-top dialogue that is served up as often as Mama Monetti's spaghetti, and you've got a recipe for a mediocrity.

I am awed by the work of E.G. Robinson. He is arguably one of the greatest American actors of any generation. But this? Let's just say that it isn't his finest hour. His Italian accent doesn't so much as come and go as meander through varying degrees of silliness, from a sing-songy, just-off-the-boat lilt to a Brooklyn-wizened staccato. In any event, it's utterly distracting. The characterization follows the same incomprehensible course. One moment Gino seems an amiable apple cart pusher, the next a ruthless white-color criminal. Characters should be multi-faceted, and I would even accept that Robinson was attempting to capture various shades of Gino. Too bad it didn't work.  There's no rhyme or reason to this performance, let alone arc. Being a hard-working actor, however, Robinson manages to squeeze, through sheer force of will, a couple powerful moments out of hyperbolic situations and dialogue.

What's up with Gino's 1890's style waxed moustache anyway? It might seem ridiculous today, but imagine how it must have looked in the middle of the 50s, when men --especially bankers, I think-- were mostly clean shaven. This speaks volumes about the perception of Italian immigrants at that time, but little of their experience.

Susan Hayward's performance is the stand-out. Her portrayal of Irene Bennett, the illicit love interest of Max, is understated and infused with sardonic humor. Unfortunately, Conte isn't up to the task. His terse and aggressive outbursts in response to her playful banter leaves the audience wondering why Irene even bothers, when we should be secretly rooting for the inevitable hook up.

I have to admit that apart from his wooden performance in ""Whirlpool"" I'm largely unfamiliar with Richard Conte's work. I also have to admit that his performance in ""House.."" isn't all that bad. What is disturbing is that it misses the thrust of the film. If we don't buy into in Irene and Max as a settle-down-in-another-town couple then his redemption seems hollow. Instead of pondering the destructive power of abuse and transformative power of love, the audience is left wondering if the film might have turned out better if the direction, performances, and screenplay weren't considerably tightened.",1190419200,5,4523,5.2118294360385145

380015,5,6301863186,"Joseph L. Mankewicz's great family drama is a one of a kind story starring Susan Hayard, E.G. Robinson and Richard Conte. Conte plays the favorite son of ruthless banker who does not run his business by the book (Robinson) that gets him in trouble. Conte takes the rap and goes to prison for 7 years while his greedy, dullard brothers just stand by and watch and take the bank over from their father. Hayward plays Conte's socialite girlfriend and nobody can deliver a one liner like a snap of a bullwhip quite like Hayward. And thanks to the bristling dialogue, the exchanges between Conte and Hayward are classic cinema.

Actually Hayward who was a big star at the time had just been signed by Fox and the studio did not know what to do with their expensive propety, so they cast her in a 3rd role despite her star billing. But thanks to the tight direction and witty and unusual script filled with film noir touches, makes this film a classic. The plot line has been used time and again but has never equalled the original.
