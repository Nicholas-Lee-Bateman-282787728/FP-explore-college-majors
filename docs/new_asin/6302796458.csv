7831738,5,6302796458,"With all the crap coming out ad nauseum these days, it's a grave injustice The Class of Miss MacMichael still hasn't seen a (R1) DVD release. I first saw this motion picture at the cinema during its original theatrical release & enjoyed the film & have watched the VHS multiple times.  I now long for a proper DVD treatment of this wonderful classic. I wish the distributors for The Class of Miss MacMichael would get their heads out of their asses & get the ball rolling, soon.  The scene where Glenda Jackson (Miss MacMichael) has a showdown with Oliver Reed (Mr. Sutton), is electrifying & highly showcases the greatest work of Ms. Jackson's career! Rosalind Cash turns in a wonderful performance as Miss MacMichael's fellow colleague & good friend, as does Michael Murphy as Miss MacMichael's love interest.",1262822400,7,811,4.869565217391305
