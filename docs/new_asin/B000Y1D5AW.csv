8230795,5,B000Y1D5AW,"Extremely interesting talk about the most prominent male dance artist of the XXth century Rudolf Nureyev. Georgina Parkinson's views (principal with Royal Ballet, then ballet mistress and coach with American Ballet Theatre) are particularly subtle and interesting. The excerpt of Baryshnikov's interview with Charles Rose is also absolutely fascinating. Thank you Charles Rose for all your programmes. I wish all of them would be available on DVD.
Highly recommended !",1345852800,,468,5.7
