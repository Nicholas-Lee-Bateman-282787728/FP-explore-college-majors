5079105,5,6304473745,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is probably the BEST animated series. I have seen every single episode like 6 times. Each tape gets better and better. Its a sci-fi, action, drama, and comedy all rolled into a 12 video series. Plus  Amazon has all the videos subtitled and dubbed! Plus Genesis 6 dubbed is  priced just right!",912297600,,316,4.7272727272727275
8514944,5,6304473745,"Anime fans and uninitiated alike will appreciate NGE for its quality animation, intricately-woven storylines, and even its above-average American voice-over actors on the dubs. On the surface, it's a story about giant robots and the invasion of earth by aliens; just beneath it's a well-told psychological examination of its characters and their stilted relationships; but at heart and in final episodes it's really a gnostic/jungian style examination of subjective reality and the very nature of existence, bringing in pseudo religious symbolism from the nag hammati and qabbalah.",1017360000,,581,5.689655172413793
8514945,5,6304473745,"In episodes 11 and 12 we learn more about the three eva pilots and what makes them tick.  We also learn a lot about Misato's background and why she is determined to battle every last Angel.
Shinji asks the obvious questions -- why are ""Angels"" attacking mankind when they are typically thought of as a benevolent force?  Was it man's blind arrogance as it pursued science that provoked God's wrath?  Anyhow, the plot thickens and chracter development really jumps ahead in this volume as the Evas battle the eighth and ninth Angels.
Misato gets promoted to major.  And the three pilots perform admirably in battle together despite the constant bickering and rivalry between Auska and Shinji.  I think this volume is where I started to fall in love with the series!",1015027200,,764,4.801526717557252
8514946,5,6304473745,"Evangelion volume 0:6 includes episodes 11 and 12, and they are the greatest!  In episode 11, a new Angel attacks Tokyo-3 and cuts NERV's power!  While the three young pilots attempt to make it through the underground tunnels to NERV headquarters, the NERV employees must manually ready the EVAs.  Then, in episode 12, Misato gets a promotion and she is reminded just why she joined NERV.  Much is revealed about Misato's past and the beginnings of Second Impact.  A new Angel arrives and attempts to break into NERV HQ, and it takes a strategic attack from all three pilots to take it down.  Even if it means their deaths.  This is a fantastic volume, don't miss it!",982540800,,667,4.64957264957265
8514947,5,6304473745,"Neon Genesis:Evangelion is,in my opinion,the best anime out their. The plot  has twists and turns till it leads to it's multiple endings, one at the end  of the series and one at the end of the movie. It is very deep and  involving, dealing with all sorts of human emotions and situations. The  plot coupled with cutting-edge animation and excellent battle sequences,  the series has something for everyone to enjoy. It would be a shame not to  get the series if you enjoy anime,action,or just a new and interesting  storyline.",968025600,,527,4.788888888888889

8514949,5,6304473745,"In what has been declared by many to be the best television series ever created Neon Genisis Evangelion volume 6 takes viewers to a new level excitment and mystery. Tokyo 3 fall prey to yet another Angel attack, yet  NERV has lost all power in a blackout. Now the members of Nerv must race to  equipe the three Evangelion units manually. But the three children are  trapped outside when the power goes out. Now there only chance of getting  in is to enter in through the outside venting system, into a dark laberinth  with time running out. In episode 12 A new Angel has appeared with the  ability to destroy all of Tokyo 3. With the commander gone again Misato  form a plan for the three units to destroy the angel, yet this plan will  more then likely result in the death of all three children. In this volume  we see much more of Misato, especially her childhood. We also begin to see  more of a development on Rei yetstill much about her remains a mystery. The  animation in this volume is once again outstanding. The music and sound f/x  are superb. Though this series is costly it is still worth every dollar. I  will say this series only gets better.",960940800,,1157,4.42654028436019
8514950,5,6304473745,"Evangelion is one of those rare series' that is brilliant not through storyline or quality, but character design and psychological qualities. If you can interpret it, you will think about your existence, and what it  means to exist. The series does actually have 26 episodes, not the 24 that  other reviews have quoted.",947289600,,319,5.0
8514951,5,6304473745,"This video was amazing !When the power fails in Tokyo-3 Shinji, Asuka and Rei end up in an underground tunnel trying to make their way to Central Dogma, when, of course, an angel attacks !The Evas have to be set up  manually, and then you have to wait on the pilots.
