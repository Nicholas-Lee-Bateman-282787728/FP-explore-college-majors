8168306,3,B00004SCAK,"I remember getting my VHS copy of ""Through The Eyes Of The Dead"" in the mail when it first came out. I remember running up to my room and putting the movie in the VCR. And I remember how very dissapointent I was. May be I had too many high expectations. But whenever Necrophagia said they were going to release the most ""sickest, blasphemous, most goriest"" music home video ever, I was expecting exactly what they said, but like I said I had too many high expectations. The problem? Too many shots of the band bashing out music and not enough of the actual movie itslef. Not to mention the very kiddie-ish gore and attempt at a Satanic ritual. Wayne Farba does do an excellent job in masturbating over a dead hacked-up corpse, and then that goes down hill when Phil Anselmo makes a [fool] of himself at TRYING to act high from sniffing glue. Overall, really dissapointing film.",1019001600,,877,4.522012578616352
8168307,5,B00004SCAK,"... IF YOU LOVE LUCIO FULCI FILMS AND DEATH METAL, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. EVERY VIDEO IS EQUALLY AS BRUTAL AS THE NEXT AND THE MUSIC JAMS TOO! THE PREFECT HORROR MOVIE SOUNDTRACK INDEED!",1014336000,,190,4.617647058823529
8168308,3,B00004SCAK,"For those of you who don't know, Phil Anselmo from Pantera plays in this band as the guitarist under the alias of Anton Crowley. The video is good, the music video's for the songs put a good message through and are quite gruesome. There are not enough interviews with the members, however. I bought this video expecting Necrophagia to voice their points of views on the music scene and such, but very little of that is done. It is, however very well worth the 10 dollars I paid, and I would buy it again even after seeing it.",974851200,,525,4.36734693877551
8168309,5,B00004SCAK,"I got this video in the mail two days after it's release, popped it in the VCR and got exactly what I wanted, GORE! This has got it all: necrophilia, cannibalism, torture, lesbianism, sick Satanic rituals, zombies and the  music by the best death metal band ever, NECROPHAGIA. This video is NOT for  the faint of heart and the queasy, but it's NOT the sickest thing ever  released (Aftermath was sicker) but it's extreme, sadistic, unrelenting  gore. You NEED this video on your shelf. I can't recommend it enough. The  video has five songs in it (plus interviews & other cool stuff), and  the video for ""And You Will Live In Terror"" has a lot of clips  from the film which it was based on, Maestro Lucio Fulci's gore  masterpiece, ""The Beyond"", which I suggest you also check out.  BUY THIS VIDEO OR MAY YOU BE IN ""THROUGH EYES OF THE DEAD PART  2""!  In the words of Killjoy, GORE FOREVER!",954201600,14,890,4.46583850931677
