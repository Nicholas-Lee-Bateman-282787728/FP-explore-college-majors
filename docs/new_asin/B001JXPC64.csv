Thank You....",1284163200,,114,5.764705882352941
3661151,1,B001JXPC64,"As I went through withdrawal after viewing all the newly released original, classic sets of Taggart, starring the late, great Mark McManus, I foolishly ordered this ""Taggart:Set 1"".  At least I recognized Blythe Duff's name & had some hope for this set.  The old Jim Taggart dramas were complex &, although Jim Taggart was a crusty police inspector - he was all too human & dimensional as well.  This ""Taggart"" is a travesty - Norton is a thoroughly callous, nasty chief - equally berating poor colleague,Jamie,& victims' families, as well as suspected criminals.  It is a thoroughly ""one-note portrayal"". Blythe Duff's, Jackie Reid, has become no more than a tattle-tale, butt-kisser. Why poor colleague Jamie hasn't handed in his resignation to his bully of a boss is beyond me. Talk about job harassment!!!

My question is: Where is the batch of earlier original Taggarts - say from 1983-88? Despite the poorer audio quality/difficulties for some in understanding Glaswegian accents- we true fans would at least be able to enjoy the rich stories & ensemble cast.

I actually became so disgusted, that I flung these discs in the garbage. The stories are transparent & the acting truly amateurish...

To the lucky folks who haven't yet encountered the original Taggarts, I say buy them & enjoy first-rate crime drama.",1248048000,9,1318,5.046082949308755
3661152,4,B001JXPC64,"""Taggart,""a British mystery television series made by Scottish TV, premiered in the United Kingdom in September 1983.  It was led by actor Mark McManus, as DCI Taggart.  Unfortunately, McManus died in 1994, and the series also lost the flavorful actor playing its medical officer.  However, the show was then led for several seasons by actor James McPherson, (a likable enough actor, but too lightweight to carry the show), who had already been a cast member, playing DCI Mike Jardine.  From 2002 to the present day, Alex Norton, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patriot-Games-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00008K76W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patriot Games (Special Collector's Edition)</a>), has led the series as DCI Matt Burke.  Blythe Duff (DS Jackie Reid) and Colin McCredie (DS Stuart Fraser) remain from the earlier cast, playing cops as hardened by Glasgow life as the criminals they pursue.  John Michie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Walk-With-Lions/dp/B00005LOUN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Walk With Lions</a>) has joined them, playing DS Robbie Ross.

This is the world's longest running police drama; it celebrated its 25th onscreen year in the U.K. in 2008, while still consistently ranking in the top 10 dramas in that country.  Set 1, now released here, runs approximately 398 minutes.  It consists of seven contemporary episodes, the complete 19th season of the series that aired in the U.K. in 2002.  The bonus features of the set include a documentary that certainly fascinated me,at least, ""Taggart's Scotland,"" about its locations.  There are also, praises be, subtitles, thank you Acorn: that Glasgow accent is a killer, though it's delightful to listen to it in its localized particularity, so long as you don't have to struggle to comprehend it. The series was created by Glenn Chandler, who succeeded in giving us a show as gritty as the city in which it takes place, pitting a hard-bitten team of detectives against some of the hardened natives of the city.

Initially, as the series opened on broadcast television, you saw a montage of Glasgow street scenes, and heard a biting ""This Town is so Mean,"" sung, in regard to Glasgow, of course, by the magnificent Glasgow-born blues singer Maggie Bell.  The montage remains, updated, with views of, for example, the fairly new, odd looking cultural center that natives call ""the armadillo,"" that is sited by the River Clyde.  An instrumental take of the song also remains, but without Bell's vocal; this is unfortunate, as she contributed greatly to the show's mood.

At any rate, after the montage came one of the very best police procedural series ever made for television. One of the great strengths of this series, still, is the Glasgow flavoring, available in almost every scene: we learn a lot about Glasgow high and low.  As the crazed mystery fan that I am, I not too long ago stayed in a Clyde-side hotel, within walking distance of the armadillo; and the series shows this landscape exactly as I saw it.

""Taggart"" must be considered a landmark; a precursor to the current Scottish school of ""tartan noir:"" the sheer bloodthirsty, dark violence, the unsentimental humor of this series has seldom been matched, and never bettered.  Glasgow is a city centered on a dark, cold, scary, industrialized river; the city has some of the meanest streets in the world, and it produces some hard, hard people.

Mark Mc Manus, who played Inspector Jim Taggart in the old days, brought a great deal to a part that must have been strongly-written on the page: he added a tightly-wound Glasgow note all his own, and an irascible, angry charm. He somehow conveyed a feeling that, as a Glaswegian, he took local crime as an offense to himself, and his city. I had quite a crush on him, but unfortunately McManus died of a heart attack, rather young, overwhelmed by a series of personal losses.  In the contemporary series, the actor Clark, playing DCI Burke, seems to play his character as always over-the-top angry; it doesn't take anything to set him off.  The current series also bows to contemporary taste by making each story arc only one episode long, rather than three, as the earlier stories were.  They have therefore lost a lot of the complexity, subtlety - and subversive humor - that were hallmarks of the earlier series.

The episodes are: Hard Man, Fade to Black, Blood Money, New Life, Bad Blood, Halfway House, and An Eye for an Eye.  Now, mind you, they do still constitute a strong British crime drama; one of the stronger to be found.",1238112000,40,4606,5.201623815967523
3661153,3,B001JXPC64,I much prefer the earlier programs.  45% of my entertainment was from the actor who played Taggart until he died.  Another 35% was from the actor who played the first medical officer.  Once these two actors left the series I was left with only a 20% entertainment level.,1233187200,7,270,4.583333333333333

3661205,1,B001JXPC64,One star only because I can't give it less.  This is more like an American TV show than a British mystery.  Very poorly written and acted.  In fact the guy who plays the DI may be one of the worst actors I've ever seen.  All of the characters are one-dimensional.  Basically a very simplistic TV show.,1437177600,,301,4.303571428571429

3661207,2,B001JXPC64,"For one thing I recognized the plots from other shows. I don't mean that they seemed derivative, I mean that they were the exact same plots and characters. The stories are flat and the characters so nominally created that only the accent places them in any time and place that is unique. My feeling about retreaded plots and characters is that you can still use them and create a drama that is unique but these shows move from point A to B to C without nuance. I also dislike The Bill for the same reason.",1420934400,,505,4.326315789473684

3661211,4,B001JXPC64,"If you are starved for a police procedural from across the pond, this series will be of interest. There is not any gorgeous scenery or voyeuristic look in to the characters' personal lives that would warrant 5 stars, but the stories are varied and the characters are good in their roles. This squad has yet to show any sense of humor. (I did get a few laughs from the close captioning, which was really awful....I use it when accents threaten to interfere with my understanding of the dialogue...not much help here as the close captioning merely glossed over those moments with an ""inaudible"". The names of the regular characters were spelled wrong, in one scene a copper was asked to kneel by the bad men yelling ""Neil!"" and my personal favorite was when the gang had to interrupt a ""Pilotti"" class at the gym)!

Though not as gritty, the acting and characters are well played. The stories are good and though they have to be PC these days they hold the attention. I found quite a few British cop shows on PRIME, and am slowly making my way through them. Though not so new they are a glimpse of home to me, especially Vera, another good show.
Only downside is the first season of Taggart is free, but to continue to follow is not, and that can be a bit costly if you want to watch the complete run.

By this collection, Set 3, ""Taggart"" has moved beyond a simple police-procedural, with deepening characterizations and plenty of local color; Set 1 is sporadic in quality, Set 2 greatly improves, Set 3 hits its stride. Blythe Duff is a remarkable actress who merits further renown; she is calm perfection as DS Jackie Reid. Alex Norton is superb as the bulldog-gruff chief, DCI Matt Burke. John Michie as DI Robbie Ross, and Colin MeCredie as Stuart Fraser, grow in their roles as well. Glasgow, of course, is another ripe character here, proud of its contract to the more ""refined"" Edinburgh. The teamwork of this excellent cast makes for a great alternative to the common formula of older mentor/DCI, plus young upstart. In this collection, each of the four must confront fraught unresolved issues; this is deftly woven in the mysteries progress.

On this side of the pond, we are completely deprived of the rest of this great series! Yes, there is more after Set 3 (Amazon UK + Region-free DVD player)! Oddly, 6 episodes between the end of what is available here in the U.S., and what is still being sold in the U.K. remain unavailable. At least what follows continues the story with very little break. Unfortunately, all that follow have no subtitles, but it's easy enough to understand, and the sound-quality is excellent. The series that follow ""Taggart Set 3"" are listed in order:

The 2009 Collection: Genesis, The Caring Game, Lifeline.

Special 25th Anniversary Edition: Judgement Day, Island (beautiful scenery), Trust, A Study in Murder, Point of Light. This collection features an enlightening Special Feature, ""Taggart: 25 Years of Murder Documentary."" You'll glimpse the old series with Mark McManus, and a piece on the the hilarious French voice-over, where a Marseille accent is used to mimic ""Glaswegian.""

The Knife Trick Collection: Safer, Homesick, Crossing the Line, Cold Reader, Grass, The Knife Trick. ""Homesick"" features another memorable appearance of Brian McCardie (featured in an earlier episode) as a menacing Bad Guy again. We need to see more of him; he's also the only stand-out in Season 5 of ""Murphy's Law."" A wonderful Special is the ""Outtakes,"" where you'll laugh yourself silly.

The 100th Episode Collection: So Long Baby, Fact and Fiction, I.O.U., Local Hero, The Rapture. In ""So Long Baby,"" the actress Michelle Fairley is a perfect doppelganger for the actress Joan Allen, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Trilogy/dp/B003H6KRIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Trilogy</a>.

New Blood, Six New Cases: Bad Medicine, Abuse & Trust, Silent Truth, Fallen Angels, Bloodsport, The Ends of Justice. The series, for all STV filming in HD, squandered a superb, long-running show. The stories now mimic American police dramas, without the in-depth character development in previous episodes. After 14 years, Colin MeCredie's Stuart Fraser suddenly departs due to a nasty firing after ITV and STV fought over the budget. This collection is the end of the line for the series, and it shows, with a dispirited cast, poor scripts, and an awkward filming style that is reminiscent of old ""NYPD Blue.""

This is what draws me to British TV and movies.  Nothing phony about the cast, what you see if what you get, crooked teeth, no plastic, no botox.  I also love the way their dramas are focused on the facts, not the people.  You become part of the action.  Great drama and I am not surprised it has lasted this many years.

3661367,4,B001JXPC64,"While this is an excellent series, ""Taggart Set 1"" is a bid misleading since Taggart began airing in Great Britain in 1983.  It was one of the longest running shows in British television history.  The original Taggart starred Mark McManus.  Some of these earlier shows are also available on DVD.

The series is set in Glasgow and features generally excellent actors led by Blythe Duff as DI Jackie Reid.  Glasgow is a gritty city and the show does a good job of replicating it as the stories unfold.  For U.S. audiences, the Scot accents require close attention since they can be a bit difficult for us Yanks to decipher.  But the effort is worth it.

The early series were broadcast by some U.S. PBS stations in the 80s and that's when I first came across the show.  In the 90s while waiting for a plane in a lounge at the Glasgow airport, I met Iain Anders who played Taggart's boss in the series.  We were the only people in the lounge, shared a couple pints and after I told him I was a fan of the show, Anders graciously shared many interesting stories about the making of the series.

The background scenes are authentic if not always wholly accurate eg an address supposedly in ""Duke Street"" was filmed nowehre near Duke St. I used to live there and that house is on the southside or in the west end of Glasgow.
The accents are accurate which is refreshing. In so many shows supposedly set in Scotland the actors cannot come close to getting the accent right. Nothing annoys this Scotsman more than a fake, phony and awful Scottish accent. These actors get it right ""in puir deid Glesca."" However the action is static and the dialogue laconic. There is no real development of the characters who remain very one dimensional. The fault lines with the writing not the acting. The acotrs can only deal with what they are given and they are not given very much. With better scripts Taggart would be a much better show. But for an exile it is always nice to see glimpses of home.

3661370,2,B001JXPC64,"I've been lucky recently in having hooked onto some outstanding mystery/thriller series. ""The Eagle"", ""The Killing"" and the British version of ""Wallander"" are all top notch. Great writing, acting, directing and sound put these as the best of their kind. I figured to give ""Taggert"" a shot and I was way off. I found this to be some pretty awful stuff.

Here's the scoop. The first episode (I never made it past there) begins with a young man getting shot. As it turns out, it wasn't for something he did per say, but what he was onto. So, Taggert and his team go to work and unravel the mystery before more lose their lives.

Granted, the medium has gotten more sophisticated since this originally aired in 1983 and the tools available are better today than they were then as well. But I found this to be flat and lifeless. The shots were framed in a very uninteresting manner. The lighting was flat. The script was Okay but I felt as though I wasn't watching actors involved in roles. It was more like they were delivering lines merely to feed plot points to the audience. I didn't meet any of them. I don't want to say they were interchangeable but they rarely reached below surface level.

Maybe this is something that got better as the series progressed but there is too much good stuff out there for me to gamble my time on the next episode.",1365379200,,1346,4.485714285714286

3661398,4,B001JXPC64,"This is a good, but not a ""knock-your-socks-off"" great series.  It is touted as the longest-running police procedural series in the history of British tv.  Okay, that's an impressive record. That also suggests something very special, indeed.  I can't honestly say that I find this series (beginning with Set 1 and Set 2) to be all THAT special.  It's absolutely fine; it's entertaining, and it does grow on you.  I find I enjoy the later episodes more, principally because the main characters have had a chance to become more fully-fleshed out.  In fact, the very first episode in Set 1 was, in my view, simply a ""ho-hum"" stock piece.  Very two-dimensional and not a propitious start. However, the series does get better, I promise. Over the long course of the British program, there have been a number of changes, most notably with regard to the actors. The series is named for the former head detective, DCI Jim Taggart, played by the late Mark McManus  However, there is currently no Taggart in ""Taggart"" -- a rather important detail that isn't clear to those newcomers who venture into the series in what is promoted as being ""Set 1.""  (And, or course, Set 1 isn't really Set 1, but comes many years after ""Taggart's"" inaugural season.  It seems to be taken for granted that we have all absorbed this info from somewhere else, making for a confusing introduction to the series for most American viewers). Instead of Taggart, we have his successor, Detective Inspector Matthew Burke of the Strathclyde Police department. He is an ornery, bad-tempered, ""tough guy"" Glaswegian, played convincingly by Alex Norton. There are no smooth edges to Burke.  His team is comprised of a rather predictable set of ""foils"" for his strong persona. There is Jackie, a determined and smart woman detective, who occasionally manages to rein in Burke's worst excesses;  Robbie, the roughly handsome ladies man, who is a better cop than his image would suggest; and Stuart, the youngest and least prepossessing of the bunch. Time and again, though, Stuart proves he is a lot sharper than Burke gives him credit for.  The team battles crime from the rough and tumble of  Glasgow's meaner streets to the posh homes and offices of its more affluent and successful residents.  The mysteries are fine -- they are compelling enough, though given the time restrictions for each episode, they are necessarily a bit more superficial than I'd like to see. More than once, in the more detailed and tense episodes, I've found that the denouements were sacrificed, as a result of a richer build-up at the start.  In these episodes,  the crimes are solved in a surprisingly abrupt manner.  Then, credits roll. Boom.  As to the other ""con"" of the series: the character of Burke can wear thin.  He's supposed to be a real pain in the neck to his team but he can also become one to the viewer. That's a small quibble and, I realize, a very subjective one.  A final caveat is that the accents are pure Glaswegian.  My grandparents came to America from Glasgow, so I'm more attuned to the accents than some folks.  I'm not sure everyone will be able to follow the dialog as easily.",1348012800,,3146,4.785185185185185
3661399,4,B001JXPC64,"I am a new convert to Taggart. As a Scot by heritage, the background of Glasgow drew me in. Then the actors and the cases, murder and mayhem, accomplished well and acted superbly.

This series revolves around the CID, Criminal Investigation Department, of Maryhill, Strathclyde Police in Glasgow. A scene of the outside of the department is usually shown in each episode. Taggart comes from the first DCI, whose last name was Taggart. He was involved in the beginning, and I have not seen those episodes. The DCI now is Matt Burke, a tough old bird, but fair and much respected by his troops. Blythe Duff plays DI , Jackie Reid. She is a superb actress abd blends herself into the team. She is the person I would trust, intelligent, empathetic and attractive. DI Mike Jardine and DS Stuart Fraser fill out the other two members of the team. Their cases are varied, often violent and full of blood. As a lover of police/procedurals, I am able to figure out who the murderer may be by the the first half of the episode. However, I am surprised at times. The series is very well written and superbly acted.

The real star is Glasgow. The city itself, shines in the sun and the rain. It is often chilly and windy, and still the city looks inviting. The old, the new, the rundown, and the rich parts of Glasgow are shown. The Scottish accents are not off putting and relatively easy to understand. The episodes are over an hour in length, and are well directed and produced. I have miles to go to view the rest of the episodes, am looking forward.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-05-12
