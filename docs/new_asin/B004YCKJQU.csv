4498829,5,B004YCKJQU,"The great Stanley Baker/Cy Endfield team that produced ""Zulu"" the year before, released this pic in 1965.  Although similar to ""Flight of the Phoenix"" released
the same year (with an all-star cast and huge budget), this more modest film is, in
my opinion, much superior.
Stanley Baker was always one of my favorite actors.  He had a noble bearing not unlike Lawrence Olivier although he was originally cast in working-class parts like
the lorry driver in the excellent ""Hell Drivers"" (incidentially featuring a cast of
future superstars).  His death at the early age of 48 left a void in British cinema
that has never quite been filled.
The original releasing company was Paramount.  The cast is terrific, including
Harry Andrews, Theodore Bikel, Nigel Davenport, and the late Susannah York.  The
much underrated Stuart Whitman has never been better.  I feel this is his finest role.  I only wish the DVD had a commentary by Whitman, Bikel, and/or Davenport,
the only surviving actors from the film.  When these folks are gone it's too late
and the only sources of first-hand memories are forever lost.
The music score is fantastic and is composed by the late great Johhny Dankworth.
It is stark, haunting, and totally suitable for this film unlike many of the mundane cookie-cutter scores in current flicks.
This is an unforgettable film suggesting a sense of time and place.  You will not
see a film like this made now because it is really a low-key character study and
almost too cerebral for today's dumbed-down audiences.  A keeper-don't miss it.",1317254400,21,1551,4.953667953667954
4498830,5,B004YCKJQU,"This is a film I have waited years to see on DVD.  It's finally here and this copy is excellent and not a rip-off or bad dupe from an old VHS.  The story still holds up and it's a great addition to my collection.  If you enjoy adventure, suspense, a little sex and lots of psychological conflict, get this very entertaining film.",1317081600,11,329,4.274193548387097
4498831,3,B004YCKJQU,"I saw this movie back in the day (when it was new) at the drive-in.  All I could remember was the final image of a man and a baboon locked in a bloody death struggle... so when it hit blu-ray, I had to check it out.

Solid thriller.  Great cast (oh, Susannah...York!  Dee-lish!), interesting predicament where survival is not so much against the elements as against each other.  A few cheesy effects in the animal and hairpiece department.  All in all, recommended.

Note: this is another film collaboration between actor/producer Stanley Baker and writer/director Cy Endfield, who had previously worked together on the classic war/adventure ZULU.  While this flick isn't on Zulu's level, it's still a solid drama/thriller well worth watching.",1316822400,8,743,5.082644628099174
4498832,3,B004YCKJQU,"When a private plane carrying four passengers in addition to the pilot and co-pilot crashes in the South African desert, it becomes survival of the fittest. It doesn't help that the one passenger (Stuart Whitman) that shows leadership ability is a neanderthal sociopath. This is a rather nasty film to sit through. Not because it's not well made but because we can't really warm up to any of the characters who, for the most part, seem rather superficial and unlikable. The normally appealing Susannah York plays a weak willed ninny that her sex would be ashamed of, Nigel Davenport is an opportunistic would be rapist, Harry Andrews is a German who may have been a Nazi, Theodore Bikel is a well intentioned but ineffectual doctor which leaves only the morose Stanley Baker for the audience to root for. Directed by Cy Endfield (ZULU), the film seems overlong though the film is infused with a sense of menace as a colony of hostile baboons ominously watch the proceedings and why wouldn't they be hostile with Whitman sadistically killing them for no real reason. The wan score is by John Dankworth with Erwin Hiller (I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING) in charge of the Panavision desert vistas with Spain partially subbing for South Africa. Effective yes, but unpleasant.

The DVD from Olive home video is a very good anamorphic transfer in its appropriate 2.35 Panavision ratio.",1316304000,7,1371,4.884120171673819
4498833,4,B004YCKJQU,"Sands of the Kalahari is one of the more entertaining action/survival films of the 1960s. A cast of mainly British actors, along with American actor Stuart Whitman, give strong performances as survivors of a plane crash in the south African Kalahari desert. Director Cy Enfield, who also adapted the screenplay, proves himself to be a fine action director as he also did in two other 1960s films, Zulu and Mysterious Island. Olive Films has presented a very nice remastered widescreen transfer with vivid colors and really sharp picture quality! Though there are no dvd extras(or subtitles), the transfer quality more than makes this dvd worth the purchase. All in all a very nice surprise for those of us who remember this film from late night TV!",1312675200,8,748,4.944444444444445
4498834,5,B004YCKJQU,"I remember watching Sands of the Kalahari in a movie theatre in the mid sixties. I recall the huge screen presentation and being completely immersed into the desert scenes. This was before movie multiplexes with screens shrunk down significantly in size. Never forgot the experience. Page forward to today - I can now watch this movie again in pristine HD video 2.35:1 WS on my large screen HDTV and home theatre audio system. It's been a long wait.

Minor negatives: No extras.

Also, the cover does not indicate the audio but it appears to be LPCM Mono. I don't know if the original film had stereo soundtracks or not. Regardless, the sound is still very good and doesn't distract. Still rates a 5 star.",1312502400,5,705,4.67741935483871
4498835,5,B004YCKJQU,"Long ago, I saw this as a child back in the Sixties when it was shown on television. Decades later, with the internet available to track it down, I finally got a knock-off DVD of it. Now I am excited to see it has been given the final glory- bluray!
This is one of those excellent plane-crash in remote areas genre of films from the Fifties and Sixties. The cast is terrific, the location is gloriously desolate, and then there's those baboons. My favorite character is Whitman's who devolves into a primal man, willingly abandoning civilization. There seems to be a backstory to him, but that is left as a mystery.
And now an observation after viewing this fine film 40 years later. And this is a spoiler, so don't read further if you haven't seen it. When O'Brian has his final battle, I had always assumed the worst. But, as he did kill the leader, what if the others are not attacking him, but gathering to recognize the new baboon king? This would complete his devolution. Just a comforting thought opposed to the horror of what probably happened.",1311984000,34,1052,4.571428571428571
4498836,4,B004YCKJQU,"SANDS OF THE KALAHARI is an absorbing, retro action adventure about of group of random people who survive a chartered plane crash in the wilds of an African desert.  Their pack leader is Stuart Whitman who devolves to a brutal animal -- all the better to fight the bloodthirsty baboons circling their make-shift encampment.  But when the final confrontation comes, will it result in justice or revenge or rescue?  The Blu-ray disc looks great.  This much-wanted cult classic finally arrives with no fanfare and no extras.  Fine direction from Cy Enfield, a great cast, stunning African location as well as the fierce colony of baboons add immensely to the authenticity of this riveting survival drama.",1311638400,53,701,5.060869565217391
4498837,4,B004YCKJQU,"This film is a classic from the mid 1960s. It is a struggle for survival under adverse conditions. It begins in a very similar manner to ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (in fact both films were made at about the same time) in which a plane with a handful of passengers crashes in the desert, this one caused by locusts.

The characters consist of several men and one woman, namely Susannah York. The search for food and water along with fighting the elements becomes critical.  Stuart Whitman's character assumes leadership of the group in an aggressive and autocratic style while Stanley Baker endeavours to ensure everyone's safety.
Inevitably tensions between these two lead to violence in the fight for control (shades of ""Lord of the Flies"").

I won't give away the ending, but it is quite alarming. This movie is exciting and well put together with superb character development and well worthwhile watching.",1310947200,46,905,4.940789473684211

4498843,3,B004YCKJQU,"This survival-in-the-desert movie isn't bad, but watching it in conjunction with ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" makes you see how good, and even underappreciated, the latter movie is.

""Sands"" is less a study of how six plane crash survivors come together to survive in a hostile environment and more of a reflection on what the movie presents as a fine line that separates humans, as exemplified by Stuart Whitman's social Darwinian survivalist, from other beasts.  While the theme is an interesting--though highly debatable--one, the problem with the movie is that the characters increasingly become archetypes in the service of the movie's underlying philosophy rather than believable human beings.

At only a few points in the movie--most notably the pilot's effort to make his way across the Kalahari to find rescuers--does one really believe that the hostile environment actually poses a threat to the survivors.  Instead, most of the ""action"" takes place at a desert waterhole and cave, where a majority of the male characters take turns hitting on the one female survivor (Susannah York), who, rather preposterously, is more endangered by the men's libidos, and her own insecurities, than by the desert environment.

In short, ""Sands"" is interesting and watchable, but it points out--however unintentionally--the dangers of ideological movie-making, which insists on subordinating story to worldview.  And, if nothing else, it reminds us how great a movie the original ""Flight of the Phoenix""  is by contrast.",1435881600,,1514,5.389830508474576

4498864,5,B004YCKJQU,"years ago I saw this movie and was surprised by it's pursuit of the theme of survival of the fittest. Human endeavour equates with the law of the jungle. Human nature is of no higher value than that of any other branch of the animal kingdom. The plot involving survivors of an airplane crash begins with the usual shifts in moves for leadership amongst the survivors, but the ultimate climax involving Stuart Whitman and the baboons leads the spectator into uncharted waters as to who the leader of the pack will be in the time ahead. I had one reservation with this edition of the film. I felt that the final scene was missing a shot that pinpointed the future of the surviving man and the animals; that of the baboons realising that Stuart Whitman was now their sole sexual right, and perhaps vice versa he had his choice of them. A film in which no other man has had his future so clearly and so uncertainly laid out.",1411257600,2,920,4.449704142011834

Director: Cy Endfield
Producer: Joe Levine
Written: William Melvihill, Cy Endfield
Stuart Whitman

Susannah York
Harry Andrews
Theodore Bikel
Nigel Davenport

This is a fascinating tale of a fight for survival at one of the most inhospitable locations: the Kalahari.  Not that it is the perfect film, but it is standing strong as one of my top favorite movies of all time.  This movie is also very believable, and I found myself so absorbed in the story that my neck hairs were on end.  As men fought men, baboons, antelope, birds, tortoises, I couldn't help wonder how this one would end.  The tortuous reality of this film is loud as the growling baboons.

The story is a flight delay in South Africa causes five people to charter a twin engine beachcraft to make a flight to Nairobi.  After a time the flight encounters a huge swarm of locusts and goes down.  Six survive, one well armed.  The group spots a black mountain 30 miles off and they make for it.  Once there they find water, set up camp, and the battle for survival begins.

A couple of comments to get off my chest before I pay homage to a very good film. In the beginning, the music was awful. The score sounded like a rusty merry-go-round.  Second, the pilot should have circled for altitude in attempt to overtop  the locusts.  They were only loud and clear on the radar.  Third Grace Munkton gets sexually assulted by the pilot.  At least she could punch him in the face as he treated her so brutally, not sob ""do what ever you want to me!"" Get mad, Grace.

I rest my case.  Don't get me wrong this is still a stunning on location movie.  This movie is not about love.  There is an uncomfortable lack of love in this movie and it makes you suffer with the characters in their isolation.  Grace gets a crush on O'brien and confesses some love for him as an armed, handsome man, but he only mumbles something about not wanting her.  O'brian comes round to  a bit of affection for Grace on the condition they not play games.  I didn't see any games, but O'brian seems to be changing.  Indeed there is hardly a civil conversation with one of the other men.  He virtually slaughters the baboons, and becomes blaming and grumpy with the others.  That turns to contempt as they manage to wound an eland. He becomes like a bullying child at this point.
What follows as the eland is surrounded is an intense fight, seemingly as real as it gets.
Whitman is perfect for O'brian's role and he is very effective. Whitman begins to steal the entire film.  One is hard pressed to imagine a more perfect fit between a man and his role.

I was simply compelled to watch because this is a movie about survival, harsh and bare.  The men are all changing as they realize they are trapped on a black rock and running out of food with little hope of rescue.  Earlier Nigel has made an attempt to reach civilization.  Out of his head he makes it to the coast but is only taken away by mining authorities and presumably locked up. We don't see him again.

O'brian seemingly half crazed for fear of starving or being attacked by the baboons begins sending other men in his group away at gunpoint claiming food shortage.  Losing his judgement he demands men he sends into the desert come back to rescue him. A man sent to the desert at gunpoint doesn't organize a rescue party.  Eventually there is only O'brian the savage killer, the others rescued by helicopter.  In time his hair grows down his back and he runs out of ammunition.  The baboons move in to surround him.  Classic movie. GJ",1399766400,,3569,4.475968992248062
4498871,5,B004YCKJQU,"Like many of the other reviewers here, I first saw this movie in 1965 in a big, air-conditioned theater and i've never forgotten the incredible ambiance--of blazing sun, arrid dessert, all those horrible, monstrous baboons and the sterling cast that gave their all. Stuart Whitman is fascinating--shirtless, macho, deep-voiced--and he just exudes sensuality and evil. Susana York is the weak, needy woman and the other cast members especially Stanley Baker, all shine. But it's those horrific shots of baboons that startles. The ending is one that will stay with you.

4498884,2,B004YCKJQU,"""Sands of the Kalahari"" is a lot like ""Flight of the Phoenix"" both from the same year, 1965.  They both sport impressive casts, ""Flight of the Phoenix"" starring James Stewart among others in the original as directed by Robert Aldrich.  ""Sands of the Kalahari"" is British with Stuart Whitman, Stanley Baker, Susannah York, Harry Andrews, Theodore Bikel and Nigel Davenport, written and directed by Cy Endfield.  ""Flight of the Phoenix"" in comparison, towers above ""Sands of the Kalahari"" as ""Sands"" offers little in its survivalist tale than that men can be like animals.  And the final minutes, widely touted through the years, boils down to some not so cleverly shot scenes with the threatening baboons that have ranked this film in the annals of film history, and I am even more disappointed that I bought it in Blu-ray.  Some of it is impressive, after all, it is a Joseph E. Levine production, but then, that's meant to be half-kidding.  Which leads me next to mention the sex aspect.  ""Sands of the Kalahari"" had Susannah York as the love interest to half a dozen or so men and ""Flight of the Phoenix"" had to rely on Connie Francis's recording of the love theme (heard on a transistor radio) to entice the all-male cast.  After waiting almost fifty years, ""Sands of the Kalahari"" has little to recommend it.  John Dankworth's score if very good.  And Susannah is quite good.  And Stuart Whitman has never looked better.  But getting to the baboons can be overly tiresome and a bit of a letdown.",1363564800,5,1499,4.745173745173745
4498885,2,B004YCKJQU,"In my opinion, Stuart Whitman is the big objection to this movie (but not the only one).  The plot is not bad.  The other actors are not bad.  Stuart Whitman, ah, is sooooo phony it's really pathetic.  For gosh sakes breath man!  Nobody walks around with their stomach held in and chest pushed out ALL the time.  Relax.  If the director wanted to portray a ""Great White Hunter"", they should have found someone to play the part who had actually held a rifle before.  Stuart surely hadn't, much less shot one.  You don't shot a 300 Weatherby Magnum with the butt at your bicep or off of your arm completely.  Nobody that had anything to do with the picture had a clue about survival in the desert.  Call me picky but this sort of thing just drives me crazy.  That said, if you don't know anything about: a. The Desert, b. Aircraft, c. Firearms, d. Survival, then you just might enjoy this run in the dunes, maybe...",1362614400,3,913,4.401197604790419
4498886,5,B004YCKJQU,"A classic survival movie with Baker and Whitman putting in neat performances and the delectable Miss York showing good evidence of her emerging acting talent. Whitman in particular uses this movie to show how under-rated he is/was as an actor, throughout he does the business with intensity and conviction: you can see he really enjoyed his work here.  I found Baker to be low-key, almost telephoning it in for three-quarters of the movie; that is until the last section when he suddenly finds his vitamin pills and starts blowing the doors off.  Quite what went on there is a mystery, but after seeing him in a starring role in the earlier movie Zulu I was expecting more, especially as he was a lead driver on this project.

Storyline:  When an aircraft containing a disparate group of people crashes the South West African desert, the survivors must scavenge for scarce food in the hope that rescue will eventually come their way. Each survivor develops their own agenda and priorities aimed at keeping their skin whole and it is this attribute which drives the story: out wit, out play, out last take on new (and darker) meanings.  For example, watch how York's character works hard and shamelessly to play the angles to improve her chances of self-preservation.

The movie is a stand out in that it features extensive passages of on-location filming and is refreshingly light on 'special effects' and over-blown 'mood music', the viewer is even rewarded with extensive filming of an authentically sun-burnt Susannah York scrambling bare-footed across baking, broken rocks - what a trouper!

Two minor quibbles:
1. The uneven depth given to the screenplay since it is only towards the end that the viewer is treated to some really intense character dialogue: had this angle been accentuated this movie would be award winning.
2. Davenport's effort at putting on a South African accent is laughable.

P.S.  Folk who enjoyed this movie are strongly encouraged to read the novel of the same name upon which the screenplay is closely based: I guarantee you will enjoy the read.",1362096000,3,2077,4.945402298850575
4498887,4,B004YCKJQU,A bit dated but still an interesting movie. Man vs. baboons with lots of action. Not a must see but fun.,1360022400,2,104,4.0
4498888,5,B004YCKJQU,This is even better than I remembered. What a character study. Talk about he who rolls the stone will have it roll back on him.,1359158400,,127,4.12
4498889,5,B004YCKJQU,"This was truly a fascinating movie with a huge plot twist' Due to strange working hours in the early 70's, if I wanted to see a movie it had to be the Late Late Show. This film was a staple- interesting and shot in Africa's Kalahari Desert. I was thrilled to see it offered specially by Amazon. Watch and enjoy!",1358121600,,311,4.2
4498890,2,B004YCKJQU,"The only great thing about this movie, is to my opinion, the very beautiful African countryside....Very striking and cruel at the same time.....The story itself, was not worth the price of the dvd.....",1357344000,,201,5.121212121212121
4498891,4,B004YCKJQU,"If you like ""desert movies"" this is one of the good ones.  (Are there any bad ones?)  To qualify as one of the ""good ones"" the movies must have the requisite trek across the sands under the sun at its most intense focus; cracking dry lips, blistering skin, the dune tumble down, and, finally the rescue.  The dramatics/melodramatics between the characters is incidental because, at the very core, the real drama is the 'man versus his environment' motif.  ""Sands of the Kalahari"" delivers this crucial scene!  I downed half a pitcher of lemonade during the ...trek!  The movie cast actors that can deliver the goods convincingly, but I am baffled by who in the world hired Stuart Whitman?  His contribution is as a black hole that sucks up all the energy in every scene he's in.  Other than the one cast miscue this movie satisfies; it's worth the price of admission and the time investment to sit with a box of popcorn.  I rate this movie as four boxes of popcorn!!",1350777600,6,966,4.60233918128655
4498892,5,B004YCKJQU,"So you've survived a plane crash in the Kalahari Desert, and it's you, 4 other men, and 1 woman.  So what's the first question that comes to mind?  Is it water?  Rescue?  Uh uh.

Who gets the woman? (Susanna York - Battle of Britain, Tunes of Glory)

And this movie isn't shy about asking that question either.

This is one of the great survival movies of the 60's, and it's a mystery to me why this movie wasn't out on DVD 10 years ago.",1334793600,,437,4.130952380952381
4498893,5,B004YCKJQU,"I seen this Classic when I was a young married man. A great cast of actors & the story line was super. Someone wrote about the plane crash...that they seen better made plane crash movies. Well it's not so much about the crash..it's how do they make it back to the real world. And let's not forget the star..that no one has mention......STUART WHITMAN.....he's handsome,strong...ladies love his looks...but here Mr. Whitman presents himself as the LONE HUNTER of wild baboons. He is his own worse enemy. The entire cast was great. It's about time they release the REAL CLASSICS..and put aside all this blue/green screen junk. This was film in the real jungles. Anyhow...catch it fast before they take it off the market..it's a real thriller......not to be missed! A great PRINT...&....WIDESCREEN! Thankyou",1328918400,9,804,5.052631578947368

4498895,5,B004YCKJQU,"Smashing epic adventure, with complex characterizations and weird dynamics. Sands of the Kalahari, deserving of the same rep its filmmaker and star achieved for Zulu, is a neglected minor masterpiece of perverted heroics and ironic, cynical adventure, played out on a grand scale. The entire cast is flawless, and the direction is smart...and merciless.",1321142400,4,353,5.555555555555555
4498896,1,B004YCKJQU,"I have to disagree with all the other reviewers of this movie.  There have been a few plane crash survivor movies and this is by far the worst.  Our heroes are stranded in the Kalahari desert and most of the movie shows them struggling to survive. Were the director and the others stupid or on drugs?  At no time do we see any of the characters wearing a head cover, the first thing you do when exposed to the desert sun.  We see plenty of Stuart Whitman dressed in only shorts showing his slim and muscular physique running around throughout the movie but without a head cover.  In real live, he would be dead after one hour, so would all the others. Also, the story line and the personality conflicts are childish and silly.  A complete waste of time.",1319328000,4,753,4.381294964028777
4498897,4,B004YCKJQU,"I watched this in the ready room aboard the USS Shangri La  CVA38 back when it was first released.  I saw it once more back in the 80's on broadcast tv and recorded it on VHS. That tape was loaned out and never returned.  I've been waiting for this DVD release and now have it.  The story is as spellbinding as the first time I saw it.

I also have the book and have read and reread it many times.

I am disapponted that there are no subtitles for the hearing impaired.  My wife, and thousands of other people, depend on subtitles to fully enjoy the videos.",1319328000,8,557,4.149532710280374
