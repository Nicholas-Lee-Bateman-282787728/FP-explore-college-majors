8274622,2,B0019MG2Y6,"The DVD starts out with Dr. Shock in what looks like a typical local horror host set up and he gives someone a hair cut and introduces the 3, half hour movies. None of the 3 are very good, all feature bad acting, okay effects (some okay, some downright terrible), lame jokes and no skin (not counting the Frankenstein looking breasts in the vampire segment.) I wish it was a little more original (you can see where all of the stories are going well in advance.)",1391990400,,461,4.372093023255814
