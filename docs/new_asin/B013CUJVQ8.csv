7363208,5,B013CUJVQ8,"I really enjoy Dead Files and I love to collect the dvds as they are released. Amazon has taken over the release of this program as well as Ghost Adventures. The discs are actually dvd-rs instead of factory pressed dvds, which are of excellent video/audio quality. I'm sure it's cost effective for them, as we're seeing other studios such as MGM and Warner Brothers releasing movie titles under the same format. My gripe with these Amazon releases is that they are not printing the episodes on the case sleeve. How much more could it cost to do that, and save it's customers the inconvenience of having to write the episodes down to have a reference. Also, if you're reading this, Amazon, why have you skipped the release of the second half of season 1, which would be Season 1/Volume 2. I'm hoping there is only a minor problem and the second half of season 1 will be released soon. Other than that I have to say that I enjoy doing business with Amazon, as they have proven to me that customer satisfaction is their number one goal.",1441065600,11,1033,4.529411764705882
7363209,5,B013CUJVQ8,"Love this show,  premise is very unique and lends credibility to findings.  Impressed with Amy's knowledge and Steve's no nonsense down to earth manner.  HOWEVER.... I believe this is actually seasons 3 and 4.... no problem for me.... there's more content than expected.... there's no episode listing anywhere on the packaging or discs... I loaded each and went to  episodes in the menu.... there are 25 episodes across 5 discs... the titles matched up to notes I had taken while watching...doing research on subject matter.  So even though I think it's really goofy it's titled wrong. .. love the fact that there's extra content..... wonder if season 2 will ever be released now?",1439596800,8,680,4.982300884955753

8727310,5,B013CUJVQ8,Dead Files one of my favorite tv shows.  My only regret is that only a few of the programs are available on DVD.  Amazon pushes their video and I have requested that they provide DVDs.  Let's see if they do.,1516924800,,207,4.125
