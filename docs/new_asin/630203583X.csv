7820395,5,630203583X,"I bought this for an elderly neighbor who has been doing this same workout for a long time, she just needed a new tape. She loves the dancing in it and it gives her an aerobic routine every day to keep her healthy.",1392854400,,214,4.0
7820396,1,630203583X,"I purchased the VHS (not available in digital). It was greatly degraded and bearly watchable. I threw it out. I wish there were a digital remaster of this
classic work-out program. VHS only cost a couple of bucks. But, I guess you get what you pay for :(",1357516800,,254,4.3125

Or, better yet, look up a class on the Nianow website and experience a live class.

Enjoy this video as a peek into the past, and see how far they have come and yet how they were already well on the path way back then.",1267401600,,1915,9.159574468085106
7820398,5,630203583X,"I love this workout. There are two instructers, one doing a harder workout and the other doing a more relaxed one so you can choose how hard you want to work out. I bought a couple other videos to mix up my routine but I liked this one so much more than the others that I find myself doing this one everyday. Its not too hard but a great workout. I have had this video for 2 weeks and lost 5 lbs already. I highly recommend this video.",1147392000,,435,3.9545454545454546
7820399,4,630203583X,"I do like this tape.  Both of the instructors give instructions about what's coming up so you don't get surprised.  The first time around, some of the jargon confused me, but I stopped and watched a couple of the moves and got into it.  They are good also in that they remind you  of what you can do to make it easier or to step it up a notch.",1095465600,,343,3.927536231884058
7820400,5,630203583X,"I've been using this tape for months and don't get bored with it.  The instructors are very engaging, the other people are ""regular"" people (not models), and the workout is vigorous without any risk of injury.  I love it.",1044230400,2,221,4.641025641025641
7820401,5,630203583X,"I love this video. It's very dance-like and flowing with easy to follow moves. It is led by a couple. The man is hard to understand, but the woman is very cool. You can follow either one for two different levels of  workout. It feels like a workout and a great stretch at the same time. I  look forward to this video.",953164800,6,317,4.096774193548387
