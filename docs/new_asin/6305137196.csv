971594,1,6305137196,"I had hopes for this one.  I thought it would be a surprisingly good movie like Road House.  At the scene that takes place at the New Amsterdam Theater, this thing goes way wrong and way hokey.  It's a waste of Sam Elliot.  You think it's going to be a crusader guy movie but it turns into a preposterous shoot'em up with Sam Elliot swinging from a lamp post shooting with a Glock in one hand.  It would have been OK that all of the characters are weak stereotypes, but the stupid gun fights and unbelievable car chases ruin this movie.  Lazy writers are the downfall of many movies. It's so bad that it's NOT good.  I've heard better dialogue between two teen aged girls on their cell phones.  I couldn't make it to the end of this worthless, dumbed-down piece of idiocy.",1241481600,2,772,4.34965034965035

I have not watched this movie for the fact that Goodtimes will screw up a good movie with bad quality picture, sound, & all around basics.  The movie itself is great to watch with Weller & Elliott in the action scenes & the story is just all in your face.  The only problem is this movie was not released by MCA Home Video, if it had been you would have a great movie on DVD instead of this blurred & muffled sound version.",1013212800,7,550,4.027522935779817

971676,5,6305137196,"In an era that gave the world such great action flicks as Die Hard, Above the Law, The Dead Pool and many others, Shakedown is a little gem that has largely been forgotten about. Sam Elliot and Peter Weller play a dynamic duo as Detective Richie Marks and lawyer Ronald Dalton. While the acting is a tad glib at times, the action sequences and overall story are amazing. An added bonus to this great film is the soundtrack, which includes the one-hit wonder 'Looking for Love' by Nikki Ryder. For fans of Sam Elliot (in my opinion, one of the most underrated actors of all time) Shakedown is a must-see. The story moves at a fast pace from beginning to end and should be on every action lover's list of movies to watch.",1455753600,,719,4.413533834586466

971751,4,6305137196,"Shakedown won't ever get shine as its year's best action film, not with 1988 boasting the likes of Die Hard, Red Heat, Bloodsport, Above the Law, Rambo III, and even Midnight Run. and, yet, for my money, Shakedown is one of the most memorable. Its buddy cop alchemy works, because of the insane stunts and because of the comfort level and easy camaraderie achieved by Peter Weller and Sam Elliott, never mind that their acting approach, let alone the characters they play, is diametrically opposite.

Weller and Elliott make such an odd pair, I really wish they'd gone more into their history. Instead, the story opens with their characters already established as long-time pals. Elliott is Richie Marks, your typically world-weary, sullen plainclothesman, scruffy and something of a renegade yet honorable. And, so far, it checks off the box of the generic action flick. The game changer is Peter Weller. He plays a public defender named Roland Dalton. The swerve is that Weller matches Elliott's wild gleam in the eyes and, although Elliott seems the more deranged daredevil, Weller enthusiastically jumps right in there with Elliott as they go seriously above and beyond to nab the baddies. You wouldn't have thunk it that Dalton is burnt out and, after fourteen years on the job, is on his last week of legal aid duty, what with Wall Street beckoning like mad. In his last week, Weller comes to defend a local drug dealer accused of fatally shooting an undercover narcotics cop in Central Park. The case pits Weller and Elliott against the twin urban institutions of crack and corruption.

Shakedown, from jump, knew what sort of movie it wanted to be, and it's a level of singlemindedness that may ultimately sucker you into falling in line. Shakedown takes no prisoner. It treats its plotline as a platform to showcase its sensational action sequences. I'm pretty sure the showrunners were aware of the narrative's disjointedness and the wild leaps in logic. Like, we observe Weller break into the police precinct under cover of night so as to obtain evidence, and we wonder why he didn't just ask his cop buddy, Sam Elliott, to get it for him in broad daylight. Like, the Assistant D.A. (Patricia Charbonneau), who happens to be Weller's ex, urging him to not give up his lawyer gig and to keep faith with his moral principles. She says this to him even as they take in, with utter lack of irony, the spectacular view of Central Park from the elegant terrace of her posh highrise penthouse crib. Also, I have absolutely no idea what was up with that scene in which that construction crane abruptly hoisted Weller's taxi up only to plant it down on the steps of the courthouse. I have to believe that relevant scenes were left on the cutting room floor. And advice to aspiring saboteurs, I doubt very much that randomly yanked wires off the back of a car on an active roller coaster will cause it to plunge off the tracks.

Weller proves to be as much of a live wire in the courtroom as James Woods in True Believer, although I don't know that he'd get away with the stuff he says in real life. There's also a bit of a soap opera element re his character arc, seeing as how he's smack dab in the middle of a love triangle. I couldn't help but laugh when - and a ***SPOILER ALERT*** for the rest of this sentence - Weller promises his new love that he'll break it off with his yuppie fianc&eacute;e only to have the fianc&eacute; inform him that she's pregnant before he could even open his mouth. Heh.

If you're an action junkie and you haven't yet seen this one, you're missing out, jack. This is one of those frenzied movies where it's as if the director chugged nothing but Red Bull and laced it with Amphetamines. James Glickenhaus, Red Bull or no, lives for the big moments and adeptly builds and sustains momentum. And, yeah, at times it's at the expense of nuance and a coherent plot. But it works. Decades later, what I remember best about Shakedown are Elliott and Weller's teamwork and those staggeringly memorable stunts and, also, how Antonio Fargas has gotten up in the world from his street informer days in Starsky & Hutch.",1436832000,,4145,4.681755829903978

971821,4,6305137196,"I remember watching this in the late '80s and being disappointed.  I think that I enjoyed it more this time because of my low expectations, plus it was fun to see Weller and Elliott at the beginning of their marquis star status.

The story is goofy but enjoyable and also disjointed.  Weller is a legal aid lawyer about to sell out to Wall Street because he is marrying money, and Elliott is an honest cop living in a theater who is estranged from his wife. Weller and Elliott know each other - they are friends with a history, it seems - but why that is the case is never explained.  They actually have good chemistry together.  Weller catches a case where his client is innocent of murdering a cop; the client is a drug dealer who shot the dishonest cop in self-defense.  Elliott works with the same band of dishonest cops that this cop belonged to. Somehow these cops are involved with a gangster - an African-American hip gangster because it is the '80s - who they initially raid but later they work with for no reason that is ever explained.  When action is required, the bad guys open fire on innocent bystanders and explosions ensue with no concern for the safety of anyone.

Weird, but hey, it was the '80s.

The story line is disjointed. There are leaps of story-telling, e.g., why does Weller think it is such a brilliant idea to break into the police headquarters rather than asking Elliott to get the evidence?  Who knows, it just happens. And how does ripping some wires off the back of a roller coaster cause it to jump the tracks? Again, stuff just happens.

So long as you don't think about what you are watching, it is a popcorn action-adventure flick that rewards the price of a rental.",1414195200,4,1704,4.5

7883669,5,6305137196,"This is a great looking disc of an 80s cult classic and the extras include some fun commentary and interviews with filmmaker James Glickenhaus on the making of the movie. If you haven't seen the film here is a review...
Shakedown is an 80s action guilty pleasure from Exterminator director James Glickenhaus that is not only his best film, but a darn entertaining cop thriller that is one of the last to take place in NYC before the 42nd street clean up and thus presents New York in all it's sleazy pre-90s glory. Shakedown is the story of public defender Roland Dalton (Peter Weller) who is moving on to a Wall Street law firm, run by his future father in-law, and as his last case, defends a drug dealer (Richard Brooks) accused of killing a cop. But the dealer says it was self defense, he was defending himself in a robbery and the officer never identified himself. Dalton investigates along with lone wolf cop Richie Marks (Sam Elliot) and they discover a conspiracy of criminals and dirty cops who now want them both dead.

Aside from it's dirty backstreet depiction of New York and some over the top action scenes, what really makes Shakedown work is that Elliot and Weller makes such a great team. They work very well together and it's a shame the film never caught on enough to further the adventures of Marks and Dalton. The characters and the actors who portray them, really click and begged for a series. Supporting cast all perform well, too, including Antonio ""Huggy Bear"" Fargas as drug lord Nicky Carr and hot Patricia Charbonneau as the assistant D.A. and Dalton's former flame. Sure some of the action is a bit overblown and the FX in the final showdown very cheesy, but Shakedown, as directed by Glickenhaus, is a down and dirty good time with a New York City bathed in neon lights, covered with empty crack vials and where sex, drugs and murder are a common occurrence. Add some 80s nostalgia to the mix and you have a whole six pack worth of Saturday night entertainment. One of my favorite 80s guilty pleasure action flicks. A fun movie.",1517011200,2,2060,4.613079019073569
