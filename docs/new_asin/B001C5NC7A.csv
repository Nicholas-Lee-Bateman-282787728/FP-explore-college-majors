I did not know that I was getting a DVD from there.  When I wrote to you (Amazon) they sent this response to the company in the UK.  They wrote back to me in essence that they were sorry but the only thing I could do was to pay to send it back.  This would have cost me over half the price of the DVD so I decided not to send it.  So I am out the money and not at all happy about it.  You should make it clear whenever a foreign made DVD is offered in your web page.  I am not going to buy any more DVDs from Amazon because of this foul up.  I think this mess is your (Amazon's) fault.  This same thing happened to me once before with the DVD from the movie ""Passed Away"".  I can not use it either.  So thanks a lot, Amazon!!!",1395360000,5,899,3.693121693121693
