7966992,1,B00006BSDF,The quality of the picture was poor.  It looks as if was shot in 8 mm & then blown up to 35 mm .,1141689600,4,96,3.0
7966993,5,B00006BSDF,"No, it's not the Ricardo Montalban Fiesta made in 1947 but the Hal Roach 1942 ""five reeler"" (longer than a ""short"" but shorter than a movie at 44 minutes).  However, it's the only English-language film starring the Mexican megastar and singing icon Jorge Negrete (here billed as George Negrete).  For fans of Mexican film history, well worth the price for this part alone.",1139356800,7,372,4.888888888888889
7966994,4,B00006BSDF,"1) Royal Wedding is famous for Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling.

2) Till Clouds Roll By is worth it for the all star cast

and is a biography of a great musical playwrite/ composer Jerome Kern

3) Fiesta is a musical with both original Mexican music and dance

Worth buying at this price for ""Clouds"" alone!",1118966400,,311,4.4035087719298245
7966995,5,B00006BSDF,"This is not so much a review as information. The only movie with

Esther and Ricardo Montalban (also Red Skelton)I know is listed as Neptune's daughter. Hope this helps. VHS copy I own

Millie",1115683200,,192,4.617647058823529
7966996,2,B00006BSDF,"I found the same error as one of your other reviewers.  I have been wanting to get FIESTA 1947 starring Esther William and Ricardo Montalban, but the Fiesta on this video is not the one.  It is a mexican story, has nothing to do with the FIESTA I would like to have.  I have also noted on IMDB that they are showing the 1947 as the film which is on this Great Musical Classics.  i will try to contact them as they are showing the one I want as available on Amazon. Ca and Amazon.com, available on DVD, but it is the Great Musical Classics they show.  I am really disapointed in this.",1105747200,12,583,4.123893805309734
7966997,1,B00006BSDF,I ordered this DVD because of the movie Fiesta which was the last movie on this DVD. But this is not the same Fiesta that was advertised with Richardo Montalban. He is not even in this movie. Wrong information was given on that movie. It is not the same Fiesta with the cast they have listed. This is like a mexican dance movie or something.,1104105600,10,341,4.2615384615384615
