1689069,3,B0000639GG,"Unrelated to the 1936 Tod Browning movie of the same name; DEVIL DOLL has a similar story to the (later) famed segment of DEAD OF NIGHT and also to William Goldman's later novel MAGIC, which was filmed in 1978 with Anthony Hopkins.
Scripted by George Barclay and Lance Z. Hargreaves, and based on a story by Frederick Escreet Smith; DEVIL DOLL is a compact but enjoyable little chiller.
The Great Vorelli (Bryant Halliday) is a charismatic hypnotist/ ventriloquist who arrives in London to do his famed show, in which his dummy Hugo can walk and talk by himself- but there's one hitch: This is no trick. But the audience don't realize that. Of course no magic show would be the same without audience participation; and co-incidentally one of the chosen patrons is Marian Hore (Yvonne Romain), the attractive daughter of one of England's richest men. Vorelli uses this opportunity to offer to do a charity performance for her.
But during the act Hugo gets carried away and he reveals his homicidal tendencies. Would it have anything to do with his ""Master"" locking him in a cage and goading him into committing murder? There's an amusing bit at this performance where Vorelli makes Hugo drink wine, saying to him: ""Don't drink too much, Hugo. It might make the sawdust in your stomach swell"".
DEVIL DOLL is more funny today than frightening, but Halliday is perfect as Vorelli; helping make a silly idea into a fairly good chiller, albeit one with a wholly predictable resolution.",1057449600,7,1479,4.849802371541502
1689070,5,B0000639GG,"Reporter Mark English (William Sylvester; Gorgo, 2001: A Space Odyssey) is assigned to write a story on dark, sadistic hypnotist/ventriloquist The Great Vorelli (Bryant Haliday). English convinces his girlfriend Marianne (Yvonne Romain; Curse of the Werewolf, Circus of Horrors) to volunteer to be an on-stage hypnotic subject of Vorellis, whose popular act also involves his sarcastic talking, walking dummy Hugo. Determined to discover the secret of the dummys animation, Mark indirectly arranges to have Vorelli perform at Mariannes aunts charity ball, to which Vorelli readily agrees since hes become obsessed with Marianne. While staying over at the aunts after the ball, Vorelli puts Marianne in a strange, lingering trance and Hugo himself gives Mark a clue to as to his secret. Further plot threads, which shouldnt be disclosed, are interwoven, leading ultimately to an open-ended yet satisfying twist ending. Haliday, in his finest hour, is terrific as Vorelli, intense and creepy, in a makeup reminiscent of Barrymores Svengali, if a bit better groomed. Lindsay Shonteffs direction (closely supervised by Sidney J. Furie) is also better than usual here (try watching Shonteffs Curse of the Voodoo sometime), utilizing lots of expressionistic low camera angles and a few avant-garde-ish negative image inserts. The (part electronic?) soundtrack is also surprisingly effective, especially since its made up entirely of library cues, some of them scored by the likes of Malcolm Lockyer (Dr. Who and the Daleks, Island of Terror). The story moves along briskly, there is some brief, mild gore and nudity, and the acting is generally of high caliber (Yvonne Romain displays some surprising chops, and the little person inside Hugo very convincingly assays the shambling gait of a living doll). The overall effect is that of an excellent extended Anglicized episode of Twilight Zone or Thriller (and thats meant as a compliment) with echoes  of both Dead of Night and Svengali for good measure. Both the original English/American version of the film and the hot continental version are included on the DVD. Purists will probably prefer the English cut, especially as the continental version completely replaces a key dialogue scene between Vorelli and his assistant Magda (Sandra Dorne) with a relatively unerotic and superfluous striptease number. This cut completely removes the motivation for the following scene and creates needless confusion, particularly for the first-time viewer. Definitely watch the English version first if youve never seen the film before. The other two scenes with added nudity (bared breasts) were reshot for the continental version, hence don't affect the story line or running time.
Source prints for both versions are virtually pristine. Physical damage is limited to some very light speckling; black level, brightness, contrast, sharpness, and shadow/highlight detail are uniformly excellent. The digitally remastered transfers are matted at 1.66:1 and anamorphically enhanced. A lightly speckled but fairly sharp trailer with very good to excellent tonal values is included, as well as a nicely done gallery of approximately 95 stills, ad mats, and posters. The liner notes by Tom Weaver consist primarily of an interview with Frederick E. West, who wrote the original short story upon which the film was based. The audio commentary by producer Richard Gordon, with Weaver, (who also paired for Criterions terrific Fiend without a Face DVD) is, as usual, exhaustively informative, although they do not directly comment on the on-screen action a great deal. Ive always believed Devil Doll to be one of the underrated gems of non-Hammer British horror (along with Circus of Horrors) and this DVD is the ultimate tribute. Highly recommended.",1032652800,41,3777,5.456410256410257
1689071,5,B0000639GG,"I saw this on tv as a teenager and remembered it as just being a weird movie and I felt sorry for the little dummy but couldn't remember why. Having now purchased ""DEVIL DOLL"" and sat down and watched it again I now remember. Image has done another fine job of lovingly presenting a rare film to be re-appreciated by a target audience. It features beautiful, crisp black & white photography and clear soundtrack. Seeing it now must be what it was like seeing it on it's release in 1964. It also features the stunning Yvonne Romain (""Circus of Horrors"" and Hammer's ""Curse of the Werewolf"") as the girl-in-peril and you can't take your eyes off her. Another added feature is the ""hot continental version"" that I'll get around to watching one day. In the meantime, I'm completely satisfied with it as it is. The performances are good--especially Britisher Bryant Haliday as the evil Vorelli. He makes the predicament of Hugo the dummy truly sinister and you want Hugo to break free...but how? I have to admit, as jaded a horror film fan as I am, I did not see the shock ending coming. I recommend this little gem to anyone fond of obscure black & white shockers as a satisfying staple of their DVD collection. I certainly have. Enjoy.",1031356800,20,1232,4.6045454545454545
1689072,5,B0000639GG,masterly performances especially by Halliday as Vorelli the ventriloquist. This is undoubtedly the finest of the psychotic Ventriloquist movies along with Dead of Night. There is a quality to the film that makes it compelling viewing.........the scenes where Vorelli is performing on stage are chilling to the bone. Its an fantastic little film - not one to be missed by horror fans.  The person below isn't the only person to have ordered two copies of this great film........I too have had to place two orders in my total devotion to this film.  The release has been delayed till august........one waits patiently!  Bravo to image for putting an obscure classic like this out on DVD.,1024531200,15,685,4.991228070175438

1689094,4,B0000639GG,"Creepy little black & white gem from the early sixties, well-reviewed on this page by several other customers. Would like to relate an experience I had as a young teen watching this in a 2nd run theater (The Olympic in Altoona, Pa; 25 cents for a ticket!!) on a double bill with ""Curse of the Voodoo."" Apparently the theater inadvertently got a hold of an international print of ""Devil Doll."" The theater was full of kids and teens dropped off by their parents for a few hours this Saturday afternoon. During the scene where the blonde is sleeping in bed after fooling around with the hypnotist, before she is stabbed by Hugo, she turns over in bed, and her naked boobs fall out from under the cover! I couldn't believe my eyes, the audience went wild, hooting and cheering like crazy, never having seen anything like this before in a movie. Of course I swore my little brother to secrecy so my mom wouldn't call the theater to complain. After so many years, I almost thought I had imagined it, but with the release of this Special Edition, I was able to relive a joyous moment from my childhood.",1372982400,8,1096,4.5125628140703515
1689095,5,B0000639GG,"My husband wanted this movie - I had never seen it and I'm really glad we rdered it. A tight little thriller which obviously became a benchmark for troubled ventriloquist movies. Great acting, clever effects and sinister mood make it a film to be cherished. Arrived safely, well packaged. A great print. The commentary with Richard Gordon and Tom Weaver was terrific - fun and informative. I was sad when i heard of Richard's passing, and glad to have his voice on his film to remind me of a happy meeting on Tom Weaver's birthday one year in New York",1331251200,2,551,4.52
1689096,5,B0000639GG,"Ventriloquist/hypnotist Vorelli (Bryant Haliday) has became a popular entertainer thanks to his acts of hypnotism and ventriloquism with his co-star Hugo. The dummy is too lifelike that it even can walk across the stage all by himself as it has amazed audiences, but an American reporter Mark English (William Slyvester) begins to notice that his rich British girlfriend Marianne (Yvonne Romain) has been acting strange and that the dummy begins to murder people.

An excellent 1964 British horror sleeper that has became a cult favorite over the years and a popular movie shown on the excellent series Mystery Science Theater 3000, but i don't believe it deserved to be on that show as it's not bad really. It's quite a creepy for it's time kind movie that is fun and enjoyable, Hugo is quite a creepy dummy himself and the film influenced the killer doll genre that even Child's Play was a direct homage to this movie including it's ideas.

This DVD has a nice transfer even on the sound to an old film as it contains both UK/US version and the ""sexy"" continental version with extras like commentary, poster and still gallery and trailer.

Also recommended: ""Child's Play"" and it's sequels, ""Puppet Master series"", ""Magic"", ""Dolls (1987)"", ""Tourist Trap"", ""Making Contact (aka Joey)"", ""Dead Silence"", ""Trilogy of Terror"", ""Dolly Dearest"", ""Demonic Toys"", ""Dead of Night (1945)"" and ""The Pit"".",1318982400,3,1394,5.052173913043478
1689097,5,B0000639GG,"I first saw this on Mystery Science Theater. Of course, now I can't watch it without hearing Mike Nelson and the robots riff on everything, but it's actually a suspensful British horror film.

Basically, ventriloquist/hypnotist ""The Great Vorelli"" thwarts Devil Doll Hugo's life long ambition to eat ham and drink wine.",1304726400,,319,5.254901960784314
1689098,4,B0000639GG,"Many of the things in Devil Doll seem trite and written to formula by todays standards, but view it while considering when it was done.  The reason it may sometimes seem unoriginal is because so many of the themes in it have been repeated in other movies and TV shows after it was made.  At the time it was first released they would have been new and in many cases shocking.  If you insist on modern special effects and graphic volence, this isn't the film you want to see.  If you like a solid, if no longer surprising plot and decent acting, it's well worth the price.",1304208000,3,570,4.299065420560748
1689099,2,B0000639GG,"I bought this in high hopes after reading very favourable reviews, wondering why I had not come across this film before as I am a fan of 50's/60's black and white horror films. After watching ""Devil Doll"" I realised how lucky I was - to avoid it for the past 40 years! It is pretty damn awful - the high points are the puppet's startling resemblance to comedian Jimmy Carr, and the hero's private-eye pal, who is a ringer for Sid James with a dodgy mid-Atlantic accent. This is awful - if you want a genuinely scary ventriloquist story from this genre seek out the Michael Redgrave segment on the ""Dead of Night""(1946) anthology. Now that's a dummy that really will give you nightmares.",1293840000,2,686,4.540322580645161
1689100,4,B0000639GG,"DEVIL DOLL is a quiet little black-and-white British thriller with supernatural overtones that might remind viewers of an episode from THE TWILIGHT ZONE or a segment from the classic British horror film DEAD OF NIGHT.

Curiously, this film is available in two versions on this DVD: the sanitized British or Canadian version, and the slightly more daring continental version. The latter includes a couple of scenes of topless female nudity, considered daring for its time. The continental version features a strip tease, done under hypnosis, and presented in a non-erotic manner. In another scene, the sanitized version shows a baby doll in the background wearing a garment that covers her upper regions; the continental version shows the same girl topless. What is more interesting is that the continental version shows William Sylvester's name above that of Bryant Haliday but in equal likeness. The British/Canadian version shows Haliday's name first and considerably larger than that of his co-stars. Why this was done is unclear to me. Is William Sylvester more popular on the European continent than Bryant Haliday, or was this a pre-arranged agreement to keep both of the top-billed actors happy?

The charming and delicious British actress Yvonne Romain, featured in such Hammer films as NIGHT CREATURES and CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF as well as the British noir gangster film THE FRIGHTENED CITY, is not shown topless in either version. Since she is quite buxom, this might be a disappointment for the red-blooded male viewers.

The cover of the DVD shows a tawdry illustration, suggesting that this might be another lurid, gore-splattered entry. Fortunately, this is not the case. DEVIL DOLL is a quiet but well-structured thriller crafted by capable British talents. The magician in the story, as portrayed by Haliday, is unsympathetic and remorseless in his efforts to control people around him, sacrificing scruples in an effort to thrill and cheat audiences by using mystical techniques to place the persona or soul of a particular person into the figure of his doll or ventriloquist's puppet. He even goes so far as to hypnotize the wealthy heiress girl friend of our likable hero (Sylvester) and convince her to marry him, his ultimate goal being to inherit her fortune after he disposes of her delectable body and places her soul into a female puppet. The twist ending, however, produces an appropriate and satisfying conclusion where good triumphs over evil.

All of this is done without William Castle-type gimmicks, without insertions of color images (found in the 1945 PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY and a couple of the American-International cheapo drive-in films), or without blood gushing out of wounds in Argento fashion. It reminds me of a quiet British thriller called THE DEADLY BEES (which I reviewed elsewhere on Amazon), a mystery filmed in color with a small but capable cast and without gore or CGI effects. When it comes to producing low-budget films with skillful actors and intelligent scripts, the Brits earn top marks. DEVIL DOLL is a bit larger in scope, but the film noir and Gothic elements that we find in some of the better British Gothic novels (a course I like teaching when I am able to teach British literature) are on hand. My respect for the British style in literature and films has earned me the label of anglophile from a British lady friend who teaches elsewhere in China (she calls me Yankee Doodle since I was born in Washington DC, but she knows that I wrote my dissertation on John Fowles and three of his novels that were turned into three motion pictures). DEVIL DOLL is nowhere in a league with John Fowles, of course, but it does contain elements of the need for control and possession that we find in Fowles' THE COLLECTOR as well as traces of the mysticism and the meta-theatre that we find in THE MAGUS.

DEVIL DOLL is a tight little thriller well-worth your time and budget. If you are not one of those who eschew black-and-white films, give it a try.",1278460800,,4002,4.967164179104477
1689101,5,B0000639GG,"One of the greatest Horror Movies ever but this film is largely unknown. This Film is better than any Horror film of it's type ever.

1689102,4,B0000639GG,"The '64 black and white horror film 'Devil Doll' is a decidedly unnerving feature that has the feel of an extended episode of the old television series 'The Twilight Zone.' The camera work is expertly done adding to an surreal feel to the film already established by the hypnotic voice of magician, sorcerer Bryant Haliday (the Great Vorelli) and his scary little possessed dummy Hugo. The storyline is also well conceived, highly original for the time and will hold your attention from beginning to end.

One final accolade for this obsure all but forgotten film is the presence of the irresistible and exotic looking Yvonne Romain. She is definitely one of the most beautiful actresses of the sixties, why some intelligent producer or director didn't take her under his wing and make her an international star is a mystery to me.
