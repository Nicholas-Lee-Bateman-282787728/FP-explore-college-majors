2666718,1,B000J3FBUM,"I had bought this on the notion that this took place before the Shinobi: Heart Under Blade movie, and boy was I sadly mistaken. I had spent $30.00 on a movie series that I expected to at least hold my interest, and have some decent action sequences in. What I saw was a somewhat interesting plot line, with characters dressed up in modern day clothing, and actors that gave a direct performace. When I seen the Three Stooges of Japanese action movies, I could no longer handle it. I'm sorry but I've actually seen better acting and action sequences in a Power Rangers televison episode. I didn't expect a Kill Bill blood scene, but I did expect that type of action. I will say that the actress that portrayed Aoi was a very pretty actress that I would like to see in other movies, and both main actors who portrayed, Aoi and Kageru, were the only ones who I think will ever show up in other movies in the future because of their acting abilities. I'm sorry for those who are fans, but this should never have been released.",1169683200,5,1022,4.412698412698413
2666719,3,B000J3FBUM,"Okay, why does Amazon, place a non-ANIME film into the ANIME section??? Although this film(s) collection is sort of good, with a somewhat good story. But is it on the level of the Lone Wolf and Cub level Series NO WAY CLOSE.

It reminds me of a made-for-tv-movie, which it probabely was by Japanese standards.  One scene has a woman raped, which make the rating R, due to person being raped exposing her breasts.  NOT FOR KIDS....

The sword play is nice, not allot of blood, not like on the level of other Japanese films.

Anyways, if you are thinking of buying it as ANIME like Basilisk is.. This isn't that at all.  SOOOOO DON'T BUY IT.",1166400000,10,639,4.418803418803419

8148980,4,B000J3FBUM,"It's not great but it's not bad really. lol Ok that is probably not what your looking for in terms of a review but it's the truth. All four movies together for less than 5 bucks is a good deal. If you liked Rogue Ninja or Ninja vs Alien (same producer)then you'll be able to sink your shuko into this. It's not as good as Sarutobi Sasuke Army of Darkeness series but it's worth 5 bucks. I will say this though, buy the 2 disc version it's a buck more but comes in WS and has original Jap/subtitles and Eng dub.",1399075200,,510,4.0594059405940595
8148981,4,B000J3FBUM,"I loved the first film - which I watched several times -- and enjoyed the second film, but I got lost as the series progressed.  I thought the filming was very good, although I have a bias toward black-and-white films.  On the other hand I thought there was too much fighting and swordplay but this is a problem with most samurai movies.  You can get the impression that all these guys did back then was chop each other up when thats not really the case.  On the other hand these are movies to entertain the public and not documentary films.

I have over 250 Japanese movies, most of them made during the 1960s and before.  All of these are subtitled and you actually have to watch the movie with your eyes to follow it.  If you pay close attention its quite another experience.  It also pays to watch the film more than once.  You will see things the second time around you didn't even notice the first, and the same is true with the third time.

It's not like English language films where you can do something else while you're ""watching"" the film, step away from the monitor for a bit or otherwise be inattentive.  You have to follow the subtitles or you miss much of the movie.  If you do this there are a lot of very good Japanese films out there.  Otherwise you just won't quite get it.",1386892800,2,1292,4.333333333333333
8148982,5,B000J3FBUM,ninja at maximum every scene is just art in movement. A great performance. Still need some work on reality but is good.,1360800000,,119,4.454545454545454
8148983,5,B000J3FBUM,"For sometime this 4 part mini series has been really getting bad reviews, and I honestly don't know why. Yes it was a low budget series but I've seen Huge Budget movies that were total garbage, this series has a lot of Action a good storyline what more do you want. Yes I agree I wish it wasn't just filmed in the woods, but hey I still thought it was great. And for the low price right now for the entire film set you cannot beat it.",1347926400,,434,4.0
8148984,5,B000J3FBUM,"The discs arrived promptly, long before the target date for the shipment.  They were much better than the 'very good' rating (apart from the shrink-wrap missing I would have believed them to be 'New', as there was not a single scuff or scratch to be found anywhere on the packaging or the discs).  I am very pleased.",1333324800,,316,4.526315789473684
8148985,5,B000J3FBUM,"Old school movie, 2 in one or 4, been a minute - but it was cool, I liked it - even though it was slow paced, seriously..",1310947200,,121,3.5185185185185186
8148986,5,B000J3FBUM,The others below are just mad because it's not an anime. This is a great series. It contains 4 movies and for under 5 dollars! This is a complete deal for Ninja/martial arts fans like myself.,1294963200,3,191,4.333333333333333
8148987,1,B000J3FBUM,"For an epic ninja film series, you'd think there would be more than one film location; the woods.  That's right, all 4 of the films take place in the woods almost 95% of the time.  As if it weren't boring enough with crappy action sequences and lame story.  Don't waste your money.  I agree that Aoi and Kageru were good in the film, but I wish I had seen them first in something else.  And the film did look like it was filmed by a soccer mom with a camcorder.  The overall quality is just bad.  Low budget or not, a lot more could have been done to make this a decent set of movies.",1236384000,2,584,4.026086956521739
8148988,2,B000J3FBUM,"Made the unfortunate mistake of buying this under the impression it had something to do with Basilisk or Shinobi: Heart Under Blade.  Wrong and wrong again.  This is hand cam ninja soap opera.  Interesting, but ultimately not too good and definately NOT what I was hoping it would be.",1170979200,8,284,4.755102040816326
