6479519,5,B00LCT48CY,"Like everyone else I have been waiting patiently for the Scorpion release of this entertaining film. The print is superb and the music will stick in your head. As soon as you see James Franciscus with the glasses and neatly trimmed beard, you know he is the bad guy.
Lee Majors is solid and heroic throughout. Karen Black is at her beguiling best. Margeaux tries hard, Marisa is class all the way, Gary Collins is stalwart and Roy Brocksmith hams it up perfectly.
Very entertaining reminiscences by William (Bill) Lustig and Frank Pesce over an Italian meal. Frank tells us some very interesting stories about his struggles in the early days especially his friendship with Joe Spinell. Includes theatrical trailer and nice cover artwork with terrific stills on the back.",1414627200,2,770,4.930769230769231
6479520,4,B00LCT48CY,"This is a guilty pleasure, especially for those who had HBO in 1979. It's been difficult to find since the early days of home video. I'd describe it as a meager budget heist film meets ""Jaws"" with above average star power.

I have to say the print and picture was a million times better than I ever expected, so hats off to Scorpion Releasing for that.

The movie itself isn't that great, but has a lot of fun elements. In addition to Lee Majors, Karen Black, and James Franciscus, you get some bizarre people showing up if you know your 1970's. You didn't see a lot of game show hosts (Gary Collins) and starting NFL quarterbacks (Houston Oiler Dan Pastorini) showing up in South American-made heist/horror hybrids. Then for whatever reason, there's a flamboyant, overweight photographer taking pictures of Margeaux Hemmingway. And I'm sure I'm not spoiling anything by revealing said flamboyant, overweight photographer will meet the piranha that give the movie it's name head on. Sadly, the ending seemed slapped together and was either confusing or stupid depending on how you look at it.

Great fun for drive-in movie fans, but probably not for serious cinema buffs.",1412380800,2,1171,4.904040404040404
6479521,4,B00LCT48CY,"Cheeseball flick with 70's star Lee Majors, directed by Antonio Margheriti.  It's another Italian horror movie that's horrible, but you don't see them anymore so enjoy.",1404345600,3,168,5.461538461538462

6479523,3,B00LCT48CY,"KILLER FISH opens like a Bond-type action movie, w/ a strike team, led by Lasky (Lee ""SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN"" Majors) and Kate (Karen Black- THE PYX, TV's TRILOGY OF TERROR, BURNT OFFERINGS), blowing up a power station, in order to steal some precious gems, while their partner Paul Diller (James Franciscus- BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES, THE CAT O' NINE TAILS) plays the world's largest game of Backgammon. After dumping their stolen loot in the drink, the group heads for their meeting point. This all occurs before the magnificent opening credits, and the most awesome disco song ever conceived! Ever! Don't worry though, it pops up throughout the movie, like a recurring dream! Enter Tom (Gary Collins) and Gabrielle (Margaux Hemingway) and their team of photographers, including a huge, blisteringly annoying man, who never stops talking. Ever! Of course, all of this has something to do w/ the scaly scoundrels of the title. Thankfully, the creatures soon begin devouring lesser members of the cast, while Gabrielle is photographed from every angle, and Tom grins a lot. It seems that the KILLER FISH live in the exact spot where our heroes have hidden the jewels! What are the odds? More expendable people become fish food, the water turns red, and Kate shrieks like she's being skinned alive w/ tweezers. Alas, dullness sets in, as the story-line just isn't interesting enough to bridge the gap between -mostly unseen- mutilations. If only that giant photographer would fall into the water! The KILLER FISH could chew on him for days! That would stop his infernal yakking! At least there's an unexpected tidal wave, and the disco music keeps playing on. Forever! Wha...? The big dude just rolled into the water?? Oh, Hurrah! Ladies and gents, witness the only good scene in this film! Glub-glub... EEE-AAAGHH!! If idiotic JAWS-clones like PIRANHA, or BARRACUDA aren't enough for you, then give this heaping pile of sea sludge a try! It's definitely a rib-tickler, especially the piranha puppets!...",1453075200,4,2008,5.051204819277109
6479524,3,B00LCT48CY,Just as I remembered. Was good for it's time would have been much better if Farrah play the Margaux Hemingway role since it was a Fawcett - Majors production.,1430611200,2,158,4.482758620689655

6479531,4,B00LCT48CY,"A lot of people are going to buy this film thinking that it is a horror movie, but it is actually an action adventure about a bunch of thieves out to recover a fortune in jewels in piranha-infested waters. Since this film is Rated PG, don't expect much bloody piranha flesh-eating (although it does push the rating somewhat). As a matter of fact, the piranha attacks are few and far between, but since this was directed by Italian Antonio Margheriti (a.k.a. ""Anthony Dawson"") there is till a lot to like here and is a rare starring role for Lee Majors, just after THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN and just before THE FALL GUY. Majors also made THE NORSEMAN, STEEL and a couple of other films between the two series, but KILLER FISH is his best of the bunch, in my opinion. Try it. You'll probably like it. Just don't expect a horror film and you should be satisfied.",1415404800,13,860,4.449367088607595
8665222,5,B00LCT48CY,"Pure , unadulterated 70's FUN . Terrific locations . Very solid retro special effects w lots of stuff blowing up , bursting and flowing and those reliably  famished and voracious Piranhas . Lee Majors , James Franciscus , Roy Brocksmith , Karen Black , Margaux Heminway , Gary Collins , etc . Made on location in the city of Angra Dos Reis , Brazil . Beautiful to look at and super satisfying . Enjoyable as the title implies .",1533340800,,427,4.405063291139241

The movie, although predictable, has good pacing, a good script, and better than average acting. It isn't, however, widescreen. Small children may be frightened by this movie, so I'd limit it to teens and family Find something else to watch if younger children are around.",1466294400,,381,4.96875
