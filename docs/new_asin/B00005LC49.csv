8215292,1,B00005LC49,"I own several Mystic Moods LP recordings on vinyl and I love them, they set a wonderful romantic mood.  Unfortunately they are not available on CDs.

These are not anything like those recordings, completely boring unless you are an insomniac.  If these will not put you to sleep nothing will.  Better than a dozen sleeping pills although maybe less expensive.  See and hear them before you buy. I wasted my money.  If it was not such a PITA to do so I would return them.",1129939200,4,470,4.470588235294118
8215293,4,B00005LC49,"I found that some of the sound is mixed with a new age theme. A lot of bang for your buck. Good started disk set. If you like ""Windham Hill"" you'll like these. 4 star~because it is a 35mm transfer.",1106697600,2,197,3.95
