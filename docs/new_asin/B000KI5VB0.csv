8175456,5,B000KI5VB0,"This DVD comes with a card-sized ""cheat sheet"" to help remind and reinforce memorization. There is even a helpful telephone number to be used in the event the viewer might have any questions. Also, it's great to be able to revisit segments of the DVD as often as necessary to learn the material.  Presentation is interesting and easy to follow. The host is likable and engaging. I am pleased to own this DVD.",1221523200,,408,4.589041095890411
