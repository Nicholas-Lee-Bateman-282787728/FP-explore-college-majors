8532856,5,B008YY9A3W,"I have several Zappa interviews on CD.  These include:

 Frank Zappa: The Classic Interviews
 Interview Picture Disc
 Interviews Volume 2 Frank Zappa

Zappa on Zappa: The Lost Broadcasts is a DVD -- which explains why it didn't work when I inserted it in the CD player.  It was pleasant to see his face during this early morning interview on German television.  It is clear that the interviewer was thinking in German and translating his thoughts into English.  His speech was excessively slow and Zappa understood and accommodated him.

There was a wide range of topics, but mostly centered around politics in Germany and the USA.  Zappa demonstrates that he is NO left wing radical, but rather a political pragmatist who can embrace ideas from both the right and left  BUT he is an unabashed capitalist.  He strongly encourages young people to get inside political activity and stressed that such action is the surest path to political change.  Unlike others of his generation (Abby Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, etc.), Zappa strongly believed in working within the system not destroying it.  Too bad, Mrs. Reagan didn't take time to understand his political philosophy.  Zappa would have been her strongest ally in her Just say NO to drugs campaign.

The entire interview did not address politics.  Zappa shows that he HATES television and ponders methods of employing the media to inspire young people to think critically.  Zappa giggled when noted that when speaking to leftist political events (both in the USA and Europe), the most frequent question concerned Cynthia Plaster Caster.

Every Zappa fan need to have a copy of this interview!",1407542400,,1638,5.041044776119403
8532857,4,B008YY9A3W,I like when items are exactly as described.  Very happy with this purchase.,1404086400,,75,4.769230769230769
8532858,5,B008YY9A3W,"It's Zappa so no explanation is necessary but for the uninitiated I will explain a bit further. Like most recorded interviews, it isn't going to make my 'heavy rotation' list but he was always one of those people I enjoyed listening to him talk anyway and I would have gladly paid the price of this DVD for admission.

The broadcast is done by a heavily accented German (I think) interviewer who does his best to be on an intellectual par with Zappa and at times I think he even tries to show himself as the superior intellect. There is a large chalk board on which the interviewer continuously leaps up and writes down things Zappa says. There are song titles, fragments of comments, underlines, arrows, and circles by the time it's done. I'm not sure what he's trying to accomplish by this but it is quite amusing.

The whole thing is so absurdly bizarre there were times I wondered if Zappa scripted it but from that sly little grin he flashes it's more like he's enjoying the spectacle the interviewer is putting on. It's one of those things that is absolutely Zappa-esque!

It's shot on an empty set and in black and white.",1401753600,3,1128,4.54679802955665
8532859,5,B008YY9A3W,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband who is a
fanatic Zappa fan.  This was not something that he had ever
seen or heard before, and believe me, he has everything
that's available on Frank Zappa.  He enjoyed it immensely
and it's a great addition to his collection.  He said it made
him feel as though he was sitting with Frank and talking
like old friends.  He would give this 10-stars if he could.
A definite must for all ""Frank Zappa-philes""!",1388793600,13,459,4.428571428571429
8532860,5,B008YY9A3W,"I've seen a few of these ""Lost Broadcast"" DVDs which come from German TV and most are music performances and the condition of the audio and video is quite poor. But this one is a real exception! There are two interviews on this DVD -one is the ""Edited Interview"" and runs about 8 minutes. It's in faded color and not very sharp - similar to the other ""Lost Broadcasts"" I mentioned. But the real meat of this DVD is the ""Main Interview"" which is one 87 minute (!) interview with Zappa where no music is played or performed but the young German interviewer takes Zappa in many direction with his questions about the various forms the Mother took (the interview is from June 1970), what his political leanings are (well they aren't leftist) and the political issues facing America (Zappa really isn't that political). The interviewer uses a blackboard to try to solidify the facts he's getting (or is Zappa just playing him on, you'll have to decide for yourself). It gets a bit weird after an hour as the chalkboard becomes full. (I won't spoil any of this.). The unedited video is in crisp sharp black and white with great sound.
There is a single -sheet insert in the package with an essay  that does a pretty good job of placing the interview into perspective.

So if you want to hear Zappa sing or play, you won't find that here. But if you really want to know what was on (and in) Zappa's mind in 1970, you'll definitely want to watch this DVD.

I hope this review was both informative and helpful.

Great session for any Zappa fan.",1357689600,14,206,4.828571428571428
