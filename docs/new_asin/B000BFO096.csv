8086159,5,B000BFO096,"These guys were firemen from south Alabama and made this video for family and friends back in 1992. I saw it originally through a friend. When they started officially selling these in 1996 I bought them all on vhs. Years later I still laugh like crazy. The videos made before deer huntin 3 are the best (deer 1&2, bass, turkey, duck and elk). All bad video quality but funny in a three stooges way. Tk passed away in 2001 from cancer and Mike continued with a few additional videos, but I haven't seen them.",1451779200,,507,4.404255319148936
8086160,5,B000BFO096,"5 stars, with explanation.. These are comedy hunting videos from 1992.. as such, the video quality is very poor. Very poor. Low budget, 25 years old, its to be expected... past the video quality, it is very funny and worth the price",1450137600,,232,4.5476190476190474
8086161,1,B000BFO096,"This is one of the stupidest videos I've ever watched. If you like Jeff Foxworthy's Incomplete Deer Hunter videos, you will think this is terrible. Low budget and boring. Now I did watch their Catfishing video and that one was pretty darn funny. Well worth the money. Don't buy this one or the deer hunting 2. You will regret it.",1447891200,,329,4.5
8086162,5,B000BFO096,if you love huntin and comedy this is a must,1421107200,,44,3.5

8086164,1,B000BFO096,STUPID sums up this movie. Bought it because friend said it was the funniest thing he had ever seen. Well it's not. If you would want to see it go to library and get it free to view. I passed mine on to others.,1391385600,,210,3.7954545454545454
8086165,1,B000BFO096,My husband is an avid deer hunter and loves to watch a variety of deer hunting dvds; the humorous as well as the serious.  He was very disappointed in this DVD and found it ridiculous and not at all humorous or entertaining.,1280620800,,224,4.333333333333333
8086166,5,B000BFO096,I didn't understand who Mike and TJ was or why my husband (who is a serious hunter) would think that they were so funny.  I ordered 2 of their videos for his birthday and I sat and watched them both with him.  Now I'm going to order some more for fathers day. They are hilarious!  True rednecks.  I know people like this (that's really sad).  The videos were great they arrived just like promised and I'm very satisfied w/my purchase.,1211587200,3,434,4.375
