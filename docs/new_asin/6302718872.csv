499171,4,6302718872,"The one thing I have learned about the so-called ""professional"" reviewers of films is that they have built in prejudices and ideas just like the rest of us...so I really do not pay that much attention to a review, good or bad.  As for The Way West"" I have seen this film at least twice.  I enjoyed it both times.  While I like The Big Sky better, that is not to say I did not enjoy this film.  Probably the one negative I have is Sally Fields portraying a young tramp who causes problems for others along the way.  But then I was never a Sally Fields fan.  I have nothing personal against her, but I liked other actresses much better.  I did enjoy watching Robert Mitchum, Richard Widmark and Kirk Douglas; I consider all of them to be great actors, so what is not to like?  And I liked Lola Albright's performance as well.  The Way West is worth watching as far as I am concerned, the professionals' criticisms notwithstanding.  If memory serves me correct, most of them hated John Wayne and frankly I think he was one of the best!  Of course, I am not a professional film reviewer, Thank God.  Oh yes, the snide remark about Andrew McGlagen's directing was not needed; but what can one expect from those those think they know it all?",1219622400,2,1235,4.368421052631579
499172,5,6302718872,"Great western, Kirk Douglas plays a ego-maniac hell bent on getting to Oregon at any cost. Widmark is in a typical role and Bob Mitchum is so laid back you'd think he was smoking his favorite herb throughout the filming.",1219622400,,220,4.525
499173,4,6302718872,"With a cast that includes Kirk Douglas, Richard Widmark, AND Robert Mitchum, how can anyone who is a fan of Western Movies pass up The Way West?  You can't - and you shouldn't, it's a good movie.

The surprising thing is how The Way West takes so many plot points from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Trail/dp/B0014BJ1A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Trail</a>.  It's the first wagon train to Oregon, and big scenes include a tough river crossing, Indian attacks, and lowering both wagons AND livestock over the edge of a cliff by ropes!  All of those things were straight out of The Big Trail.

But there are some significant differences.  The Way West plays much more like a late 60's Western, with bits of TV Soap Opera drama thrown in.  That both gives it some charm and holds the movie back from being as good as it could have been.

Andrew V. McLaglen (Victor McLaglen's son) does a good job moving the story along, and gets some strong performances (although nowhere near their best) from Douglas, Widmark, and Mitchum.  As the director on The Way West, McLaglen's visual style is good, but not quite up to the great levels of some of the better Western directors of the 40's and 50's.  There is plenty of beautiful scenery to be had here, though, and the scope of the film is pretty big.

While it doesn't quite meet it's full potential, The Way West is still a strong movie, and with a cast like this it's certainly worth a purchase.",1214697600,14,1498,4.904761904761905
499174,3,6302718872,"Despite the lukewarm reviews, and maybe because I've never heard of the book it's based on, I thought this movie was a real hoot. Widmark, Mitchum and especially Douglas ham it up pretty good but that just adds to the fun of this sprawling epic about pioneer settlers determined to make it to Oregon. It's fun to see Widmark playing against type as a boozy, happy-go-lucky farmer with a beautiful wife and a serious case of wanderlust and Mitchum hilariously underplays his role as the requisite indian-wannabee trail guide, but this is Kirk's show through and through. He plays the hard edged ruthless tycoon, determined to reach Oregon at all costs so that he can fulfill his dream of empire building and it's always a delight to see him going fullstop, as he does here. Sally Field plays a raunchy southern girl too, a character that seems a bit daring for the times. Not a great western by any means, but a very entertaining flick and a worthy addition to any classic film library.",1213056000,10,985,4.666666666666667
499175,3,6302718872,"The film version of A. B. Guthrie, Jr.'s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel  is scenic but uncompelling. Reading the book, which is the middle volume of the Big Sky Trilogy (between _The Big Sky_ and _Fair Land, Fair Land_), the reader feels that he or she has been along on the first (1843) wagon train on what was to become the Oregon Trail. Watching the 1967 movie, the viewer sees a trio of highly competent male stars who appeared in many westerns--Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, and Richard Widmark--and the first movie appearance of Sally Field (already hammy). The movie (directed by the undistinguished mostly tv director Andrew McLaglen) shows various difficulties of the trip and some spectacular western scenery, but it's hard to care very much what happens to anyone on the trek.
The soap opera aspects, particularly a vengeful harridan widow, Mrs. Mack (Katherine Justice) are played up and the movie's plot is less epic, considerably more melodramatic than the book. I guess that it's redundant to say the book is better, but this is a considerable understatement. The book is moving and engaging. The movie is neither. The cinematography of William H. Clothier  is impressive, but the viewer does not know where on the way the travelers are, how far they have gone, how far they have yet to go.... or much care if they get there.",1036800000,21,1338,4.889867841409692
499176,3,6302718872,"Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, and starring the mightily impressive trio of Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, and Richard Widmark, this  epic western should be a lot better than it is.  Despite the endless parade  of cliches, stereotypes, and the soap opera mentality that permeates the  script, those three stars make this an entertaining, if slow, ride.  What  really calls attention to the film these days is the presence of Sally  Field in her film debut.  In 1967, the year the film was released, who  would have ever thought that Field, then still known primarily as TV's  ""Gidget,"" would go on to bag two Oscars, while only one of the  superstar trio that heads the cast would take home the gold (and Kirk  Douglas's Oscar was an honorary one at that).",926985600,17,765,4.712121212121212

499260,5,6302718872,"Normally I prefer character-based movies, but in this film, the characters are upstaged by the magnificent landscapes of the Oregon Trail. From the Missouri River country, across prairies and wastelands and wild rivers, over the towering snow-covered Rockies, down into the Snake River Canyon, across the Cscade mountain range into the Willamette Valley, this movie is breathtaking in scope and astonishing in production value. Nearly every scene was shot on location and it shows. No phony-looking soundstage sets here.

The cast of course is first-rate, though they must constantly contend with the gorgeous scenery that dwarfs even the likes of Kirk Douglas, Richard Widmark and Robert Mitchum. The direction deftly balances the drama and the incredible cinematography, and a rousing epic score equals the visual grandeur. The script is as good as it could be expected, given that the characters are almost secondary to the fantastic panoramas.

The story itself is fairly simple; something like a road picture - only without any road. A saga of two men fighting each other across the country, as well as fighting the wilderness, the elements and the Indians, who are respectfully portrayed here. All in all, the viewer gets a glimpse (but just a glimpse) of what it must have been like for the intrepid pioneers who really did the things shown in the movie, and much more. As close as you will ever come to knowing the hardships and drama of crossing the plains.

All in all, well worth seeing.",1494201600,3,1498,5.032258064516129

It has a great cast - Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, Richard Widmark, and Sally Field - but despite various events occurring that should be exciting, they weren't exciting. Douglas played a tyrannical wagon train leader who is accompanied by his young son. He makes a decision that angers the people he is leading. Mitchum was a friendly guide for the train who gives advice on occasions. He is involved in a fight with an Indian that is over in about ten seconds. Widmark comes with his wife and son. His wife would have preferred to remain where she was, but Widmark has the wanderlust. He dislikes Douglas. Widmarks son wants to marry Sally Field, but she is interested in a married man. The wagon train is going to Oregon.

499336,4,6302718872,"What makes this rather lengthy movie work is the interaction between the three leads, all of them famous Hollywood names and each embodying a different concept.  Senator William J. Tadlock (Kirk Douglas) is a visionary who, after losing his wife, decides to assemble a company of pioneers to migrate to Oregon cross-country (and, indeed, the first big wagon outfit to do so made the crossing in 1843, as Tadlock's does) and establish a more or less utopian community to be called Crystal City.  Dick Summers (Robert Mitchum) is a former mountain man who has also lost his wife (an Indian) and is additionally slowly losing his eyesight, but his reputation is such that Tadlock knows he has to have him to guide his wagons across country.  And Lije Evans (Richard Widmark) is a born pioneer who has gradually moved his wife Rebecca (Lola Albright) and 19-year-old son Brownie (Michael McGreevey) from Pennsylvania to the edge of the Missouri frontier, where Becky hoped they'd stay--until Lije realizes that it's really possible to go farther.  Summers, besides lending his expertise as a guide (particularly in a tense and perfectly choreographed sequence in which he and Lije, mounted on matching buckskins, switch places repeatedly to decoy a party of Indians away from the train), becomes a mentor to Brownie, a friend to Lije, and a moderating influence as Tadlock--especially after the death of his son Billy (Stefan Arngrim)--transforms more and more into a tyrant, until finally his people can no longer bear his rule and cast him out.

As Seth Adams of ""Wagon Train"" once cogently observed, a wagon train is ""just like a town on wheels, only worse,"" and part of the appeal of the movie is the lesser characters--the way they're sketched, the way they interact with and influence the leads and the story.  There's Hank McBee (Western vet Harry Carey, Jr.), who's determined to start a peach orchard with the seedlings he carries on the side of his rickety wagon, and his sexually precocious daughter Mercy (Sally Field, then 21, whose first feature-film role this was), whose union with Johnnie Mack (Michael Witney, also in his big-screen debut, whom some viewers may recall as guide Buck Coulter from the short-lived TV series ""The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters"") sparks both a face-off with Indians and an unexpected wedding; Mack's wife Amanda (Katherine Justice), whose refusal to consummate their marriage may be the root cause of half the troubles the train experiences; the Fairmans (Stubby Kaye, Elisabeth Fraser), who present it with its first newborn; Preacher Weatherby (Jack Elam), who stows away under the running gear of the Evans's wagon (watch the clever way Summers originates to get him legitimately into the company).  And if there's less violence than you might have expected, it's worth remembering that in the 1840's, despite the misgivings of wagoners, Indian trouble, especially of the large-scale kind, was still really very rare on the plains; it was, as the movie shows, mostly the land itself that presented barriers.",1451433600,2,3052,5.079840319361278

There is virtually nothing redeeming about this movie; perhaps only the cinematography of the Oregon Trail landscape.  Other than that - Nothing!  The screenplay is terrible; no, let me rephrase, it is  dreadful, awful, terrible, atrocious, disgraceful, deplorable, shameful, hopeless, and lamentable.  It departs farther from the book than a north is from south.  Unrealistic costuming (Kirk Douglas's character traverses the west in a suit coat?? - come on!!).  Women with heavy make-up (eyeshadow, lipstick and face powder)  on in the Utah desert?  Mitchum's portrayal of a ""mountain man"" is laughable.

One could probably call this a deluxe version of the 50's TV series, ""Wagon Train.""

The script is based on A.B.Guthrie's novel of the same title, tracing the journey of a group of Easterners hell-bent on starting a new life in God's country, better known as Oregon.

Their dreams of reaching the promised land are nearly shattered, when they encounter numerous perils enroute, thanks to the guidance of a cruel and hard-driven trail boss, who will stop at nothing to win the race to the West.

What spices this movie up is its cast of veteran actors....Robert Mitchum, Richard Widmark, and Kirk Douglas, as the sadistic trail boss.  Oh yes, and Sally Field, as the flirtatious, Mercy McBee, in her first movie role.  You might even recognize child-actor Stefan Arngrim(Alison's brother) as Kirk's young son, who would eventually land a role in TV's ""Land of the Giants.""

John Wayne typically ""over-acted"" and co-star in Fort Apache Henry Fonda never was a good actor (his off-spring Jane and Peter are even more pathetic as actors-I ask you-did"" you ever see the ""character"" Jane Fonda played instead of the so-called ""actress-"", pretending to be a character instead of just Jane Fonda you were watching-I rest my case).
Fort Apache was a ridiculous diatribe with usual Wayne over-acting and Fonda reading lines like a zombie.  Yet The Way West was a pathetic failure????  Give me a break. The fact is Wayne movies like Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon were ridiculous brainless caricatures and The Way West more creditible and certainly should be equal if not better.  My view-The Way West....at least 3 star....Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow ribbon 1/2 star at best.",1259280000,,1315,4.637931034482759

More so than any Western I've ever seen, I've never been so conscience that I was watching a poorly directed Hollywood-clich&eacute; ridden farce. EVERYONE walks through their roles (and I am a fan of all three lead actors) no doubt because they know that the script is childish, pretentious, and just plain stupid.

Too bad Hollywood doesn't makes films the this anymore.  They would sell FAR, FAR, FAR better than anything with Herr Scientological Fuhrer Cruise-O-Whackjob!  (MY OPINION OF HIM! Talented but NOT as talented as he thinks he is!  Or is credited as being!  By his age Charleton Heston had several Oscar nominations along with several OSCARS and same goes for John Wayne.)

I bet they could do a CGI based Western inserting John Wayne, Dean Martin, Robert Mitchum, Jimmy Stewart, and few others and rock the box office with only one other ""LIVE"" main character of no famous significance.  It's proven the even 20+ years dead John Wayne STILL out performs most of today's so called stars by being number 7 in DVD income!

Dull in others. Overall, not bad, but could have been better. Same for Kino Lorber's transfer. First half of the movie looks quite fine; bold rich colors and fine detail aplenty, with a few light speckles and age-related damage - nothing obtrusive. Inexplicably, the second to last reels appear to have been borrowed from either a worn print master or, in a few spots, even a dupe negative. Rough shape here, and a real disconnect from the rest of the disc quality.  Bottom line: for die hard Kirk Douglas/Richard Widmark/Robert Mitchum fans. Others should steer clear. It's not a seminal western, just a big, bloated and occasionally glossy one.  Think of this as the poor man's 'How the West Was Won'.",1521331200,,869,4.904761904761905

It is 1843 in Independence Missouri. Mr. Tadlock wants a guide to lead people to Oregon. He talks to Mr. Summers, who doesnt want to go. Another man left Pennsylvania. Others join the group and leave in April. We see the various people and their personalities. The wagons travel at walking speed. [Then people used oxen not horses to pull wagons. They were more fuel efficient.] Who will cross first? There is a fight to settle the conflict. How did they cross rivers then? Carefully.

One wagon has a problem, their first casualty. Speed or unpreparedness? Or a heavy money belt? They draw the wagons into a rough circle at night. A boy is born, there is a celebration. Stragglers run into trouble but a deal is made for whiskey. Will this cause trouble? People talk in the night. There is a shot. The story runs on. There is a question of the route. One way across the sands can save a week but there is no water for man or beast. But they find a pond. One young man has a bad accident with his buggy!

Eventually they reach Port Haul. There is a marriage for Mercy and her young man. Some consider going to California. One mans wife is ailing. The rumor of smallpox panics people, they must leave immediately. There is snow on the ground now. A trip uphill requires lightening the wagons. There is a fight between two men over this. There is a deep valley to get over. [Shouldnt the guide have avoided this?] Should they go south to California? A rope lowers people and cattle into the canyon. The rope is cut, Tadlock falls down the hill. The train moves on.

This is a big budget production but has a poor story. How historical is this move? Or dramatic? There have been better Westerns.",1520985600,,1717,4.4412698412698415

7829879,3,6302718872,"The Way West is a 1967 Western about the courageous men and women who leave the comfort and safety of life in the East for the promise of free land and a better life in the untamed West. The year is 1843 and former Senator William J. Tadlock (Kirk Douglas) has the vision and foresight to dream of an empire beyond the Rockies. Joining his wagon train as it rolls out of Indianapolis, Missouri, are others who share his ideals  a dirt farmer (Richard Widmark), and a tough, embittered scout (Robert Mitchum). After loading up their wagons and heading for Oregon Territory, they encounter dangerous rivers, burning prairies, hostile Indians and herds of stampeding buffalo.

Tadlocks goal is to establish a utopian society, which causes him to act mercilessly toward his followers. Douglas plays Tadlock with gritted teeth and a generous helping of hamminess, which undermines his character. Rather than speaking in conversational manner, Douglas tends to orate. This is the story of a group of folks enduring countless hardships in order to carve out a better life for themselves. Director Andrew V. McLaglen is at his best showing the day-to-day life of the travelers, but cant help switching to grandiose vistas, causing the drama to be sometimes epic and sometimes personal saga.
