8236504,5,B00101EEL4,This was full of memories when we were children. 68 years old now and married 44 years and this was still a great movie.,1469923200,,120,4.041666666666667
8236505,5,B00101EEL4,"Natures half acre is an older top quality classic,  AAA+ for childrens learning and for its shear entertainment value, we are so pleased to have a copy of it for our collection........",1417392000,,184,4.75
8236506,4,B00101EEL4,"Loved this short, but beware that it is dated looking and all the ""snap, crackle, pops"" from old film are still on there and bad enough that it is a real distraction. I bought this to share with the grandkids - ages 10, 8 & 5 - because I loved it so much as a kid.  Once I got them past the dated look and to ignore the crackling noise, they really liked it.",1392595200,,358,3.8378378378378377
8236507,5,B00101EEL4,"This movie makes me happy every time I see it.  There may be nature films with more technical prowess, but none with more heart and humor.  Buy it!  Watch it with a kid.  Make half-an-acre of the word a  better place.",1375660800,,217,4.195121951219512
8236508,5,B00101EEL4,"I saw this film when I was a sophomore in high school.  I have seen many ""nature"" movies since but I think this movie
still is one of the best.  Sincerely,  KST",1365120000,,160,3.9375
8236509,5,B00101EEL4,"This is a precious film.  The first stop motion film made by the uncle of a friend of mine.  He had the idea that he could film a flower opening, show it opening up in seconds instead of hours.  An idea which has been further developed over time.  It's wonderful to have a copy of this film.  The idea the Disney was interested in nature at this time is terrific.  I'm happy it's available to see these early awakenings.",1282867200,2,420,4.253164556962025
