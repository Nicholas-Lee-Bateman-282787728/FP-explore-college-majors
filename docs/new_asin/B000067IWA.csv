7962851,4,B000067IWA,"Kenshin Himura was an assassin for the imperialist army during the revolution. At the turning point something happened and he just vanished. 11 years later he encounters a girl named Kaoru while wandering through Tokyo. He saves her life just before she is killed trying to fight a notorious murderer. He begins living with her at her dojo. They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.

I'm not that wild about this part of the series. The black knight saga comes to an end, and a new tale begins. A group of magic users is out to take over the country. Kenshin meets a new ally and they take up the fight together. Unfortunately Kaoru is poisoned in the fight, and is on her death bed.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative. All in all this show owns.",1353196800,,1443,4.610894941634241
7962852,4,B000067IWA,"The penultimate ""Rurouni Kenshin"" DVD offers up the end of one major story arc in from the ""Tales of the Meiji"" period and the start of the final story arc for the masterless, roving samurai named Himura Kenshin, with only a single comic relief episode in between the two.  ""A Shinobi's Love"" presents episodes 87-90 of the Japanese anime series:
Episode 87, ""Schneider's Bet: The Collapse of the Black Knights"" picks up right where we left off, with Kenshin and the gang fighting the guardians of the legendary Divine Elixir, while Meldars and the Black Knights from Germany, along with Misanagi and her Sanada Ninja Clan, close in on both as well.  Episode 88, ""The Two Guides: Yahiko and Yutaro's Eternal Vow"" provides the end of this story arc, which pivots on the unexpected feelings that Lieutenant Schneider feels for the ninja, Misanagi.  Meanwhile, once again somebody has to explain the whole deal with Kenshin's reverse blade sword.  There are some definite Wagnerian elements to this story.  It looks like the creators are familiar with Sigfried, et al.
The expected comic relief episode that invariably comes at the end of a ""Rurouni Kensin"" story arc is Episode 89, ""To My Angel Misao: A Fetching From Kyoto,"" and this is one of the better ones of these we have seen in a while.  Basically all the female characters from the series get together for a bit of shopping, during which Misao's youth and inexperience become the topic of conversation and helpful suggestions.  Episode 90, ""Fen Shui, Surprise Attack: The Mystery of the Pentagram Spread"" brings some mystical elements into play as a giant mystical pentagram that existed in Edo three centuries earlier comes back into play.  It seems that the area around Kamiya Dojo is having bad vibes, which are manifesting themselves in some pretty interesting ways.  This will be the final ""Rurouni Kenshin"" story arc, so (all together now), you won't want to miss it!
As always we are treated to some ""outtakes"" from the dubbing sessions (lots of problems getting the lines to fit this time around), and the liner notes introduce us to a great proverb: ""Shou wo in to suramno wa mazu uma wo iyo"" (""f you want to shoot down the general, you must shoot down the horse first"").  These have been really educational and I wish there was an easy way of putting them all together in a handy dandy reference book besides typing them off the screen (and making all sorts of spelling mistakes).  For those who like the new title songs they can be checked out without the credits.  It will be interesting to see how Kenshin ends his wanderings, although since the dojo has been his home base of operations since pretty much the start of the series he has not really been wandering.",1080086400,7,2733,4.766949152542373
7962853,5,B000067IWA,"You people and your close-mined opinions about the  so-called""filler episodes"" astound me, there is nothing in this world wrong with any of these episodes rurouni kenshin is a great series includeing every episode thats been written about kneshin includeing the ""filler episodes"" and to hell with anybody who thinks differently because you are irrelevant to my rurouni kenshin happiness. SCREW THE HATERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1077321600,6,421,5.790322580645161
7962854,4,B000067IWA,"While I have to admit the end of the German Knight saga and the beginning of the Feng Shui arc are lame, the 3rd episode on the DVD, ""To my Angel Misao: A Fetching From Kyoto"" has to be one of the funniest and worth watching episodes of the series (worth 4 stars by itself).
It's worth buying this DVD to see this one episode. Too bad it got stuck on this DVD, but I strongly reccomend watching it.
A smart mix of seriousness and humor, it shows the first serious signs of Aoshi having feelings for Misao, yet hilarity ensues when a group of characters go out for the day.",1076284800,8,572,4.162162162162162
7962855,1,B000067IWA,the episodes are not really good and they have no importance at all... i didn't like it and nobody among my friends did either... not recommended,1063929600,,145,4.615384615384615
7962856,2,B000067IWA,"What made Rurouni Kenshin so great was the mix of fact (feudal Japan, customs, legendary characters) with incredible swordsmanship, capable villains, and heroes having to outwit, not just overpower their opponents. When the creators decided to go the way of making this disc Indiana Jones meets Kenshin, it becomes clear that news reports of them attempting to create new storylines merely to extend the series are true.
A secret German organization of knights teamed up with the local ninja captain, Misanagi, continue to pursue Kenshin and his gang, plus Misao and Yutaro, Yahiko's one-time rival, as they follow vague clues to discover a valuable secret ""treasure."" Most of the shows are devoted to the group getting out of sticky traps and solving clues. Thankfully, there are a few fights involved: an extended sequence versus Misanagi's personal guard, and the final sequence against the knights. Even so, these pale in comparison to the great battles early in the series.
Again, not essential if you bought the series for what it showed early on. It'll satisfy your craving for episodes, but overall, leave you wishing they stuck to their original ideas.",1056499200,6,1161,5.148148148148148
7962857,3,B000067IWA,"This is a well done series totally overall. Some episodes dragged on, like the animators are hurting occassionally for plot line or the editor was sleeping who knows. But overall the series will entertain you well. However don't miss an episode this series is one you have to start at the beginning and follow to the end or you'll become confused as to what is the plot. The animation itself is very well done.",1049068800,3,410,4.554054054054054
7962858,1,B000067IWA,"The fillers are not even worth it.  any DVD after fire reqiem is not worth it.  I saw an episode from this DVD at a convention, and I was extremely dissapointed.  It could have been good if they had added certain things in, and changed the story around a lot.  Unless you are a EXTREME HARDCORE fan of kenshin, do NOT buy this.
By the way..
The jinchuu arc was animated (from a certain point of view), it was just shortened.  Alot.  Just watch the newest RK ova, Seisou Hen.  Its not out in the US yet, but it takes place when Kaoru and Kenshin's son kenji is about 11-12.  It has a long flashback sequence to the jinchuu arc (Kenshin vs Enishi) and it also has things about Yahiko inheriting the Sakabatou, and also about Sanosuke after the very last short manga in the Kenshin Kaden artbook.",1039392000,6,793,4.3108108108108105
