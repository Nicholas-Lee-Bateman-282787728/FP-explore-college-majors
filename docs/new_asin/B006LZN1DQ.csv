I have been to Israel two times!  It is difficult to remember everything that you are told while touring and so itvwas a great refresher!",1518307200,,297,4.157894736842105
8500541,5,B006LZN1DQ,"This is the kind of DVD set that the armchair historian can buy with confidence.

Effectively this is the DVD companion to the book on the same subject, here the books author Simon Sebag Montefiore discusses the history of Jerusalem from ancient times to the early 2000's. As such it has a lot of ground to cover but in a way - given its waxing and waning fortunes over the millennia - Jerusalem is a city that lends itself to be viewed through a range of great epochs and the fallow years can be viewed with less detail.

The camera work and the steady, authoritative way the work is presented works in its favour and the study of some of the great characters who have made their mark on the city fills the show with human frailty and greatness. Which rescues it from being a dry voice narrating over shots of rubble.

Those viewers who are religious will probably find this show interesting as the meaning and importance of the city to the various religions is of course discussed in some detail. The various tragedies that have befallen the city will resonate with anyone however.

Anyone considering buying this product would do well to ensure they can actually play the DVD as this is a BBC production and its region coding may not be compatible with your equipment.

All up a very good buy if you have an interest in the actual history of the place.",1405123200,,1355,4.491869918699187
