Now, we need PBS to release more episodes and sets to DVD!

****I was NOT provided this item for free or at a discounted price.  I just like to buy things and try to help the next consumer by writing up my experience****",1469491200,,356,3.971830985915493
8700839,5,B00T797I3W,"""Best of Bluegrass Underground Vol 2"" features some of the highlight moments from season's 2 through 4 from one of the most unusual music programs there ever have been. Recorded in a cave 333 feet below the ground the show over the year's have had some top notch performers appear on the stage and what you have on this DVD are a few of those performances.

The performers you get on this DVD include Andrew Bird, The Civil Wars, Davina and The Vagabonds, Jerry Douglas, Vince Gill, David Grisman FolkJazz Trio, Infamous Stringdusters, Jason Isbell, Sarah Jarosz, Jim Lauderdale, Doyle Lawson, Del McCoury Band, Scott Miller, North Mississippi Allstars, Old Crow Medicine Show, Leon Russell, The StreelDrivers, Lucinda Williams, Widespread Panic and the Wood Brothers.

 It is a virtual who's who of musicians from bluegrass, folk, blues, country, folk rock and Americana music. And that provides one misleading situation for this program. The title of the show has the word bluegrass in it but in fact they have other musicians from other genre of music as well. That is no problem for me since I have a wide range of interest in just about all kinds of music. But for those fans of Bluegrass expecting to hear their favorite music it can be a letdown to tune in and hear something totally different. On the other side of the issue I wonder how many people haven't watch this because they think it is only bluegrass music being played. They are missing out on some fantastic music as a result. So if you haven't seen ""Bluegrass Underground"" before then spend a little time doing some musical spelunking down in the cave and get to know and hear a lot of some outstanding music.",1459555200,3,1678,4.739726027397261
