1375637,5,B00004YKS9,"THIS IS A FUNNY MOVIE ANOTHER RODNEY DANGERFIELD CLASSIC.
THIS MOVIE IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN.",1188432000,,98,5.1875
1375638,1,B00004YKS9,Rodney Dangerfield is supposedly becoming mormon(Church of Jesus Christ)  but this movie didn't get any fact right.  the church is never mentioned by name for a reason.  polygamy.  look like Amish.  a collection plate?  this movie stinks and i'm very offended.,1128038400,,260,5.219512195121951
1375639,4,B00004YKS9,"Not the best Rodney Dangerfield film, but funny. Rodney carries this movie with his oneliners, other than that this movie probably wouldn't have much else to offer. Appearances by John Byner and Andrew ""dice"" clay too. If you're a fan of Rodney you'll enjoy it.",1071792000,4,261,4.822222222222222
1375640,1,B00004YKS9,"I have been a fan of Rodney's for twenty years. However, I can't defend him here. The movie is a dud. High school production methods, looks like it was shot with a cam-corder in one day.
No wonder it never made it to the theaters, they couldn't get distribution, no one would handle it.
If you're a die-hard RD fan, then here are the films you want to see, in descending order of quality:
1.  Back To School
2. Caddyshack
3. Easy Money
That's it.  He's still great live, though. Saw him at Radio City Music Hall in May, 2001 and he lit the place up.",1003017600,9,549,4.169811320754717
1375641,5,B00004YKS9,"I don't know why Rodney Dangerfield's movie ""My 5 Wives"" did not receive a wide theatrical release, since it is his funniest film in years.  The jokes start right from the beginning, when Rodney is in divorce court.  ""Every time I wanted sex, my wife left the room to give me privacy!  The last time I had sex, I was arrested for assault with a dead weapon!"", he tells his lawyer.  Also appearing in the movie are John Byner, playing a crooked banker, Andrew Dice Clay, who plays a Mafia underboss and Jerry Stiller, playing a Mafia don who knew Rodney when they were both kids in the old neighborhood.  As Rodney tells Jerry regarding his father, ""In our neighborhood, he was the first one to start acupuncture - with an ice pick!""

A memorable scene is when Rodney takes his five wives to Las Vegas.  At first, they appear poolside wearing one piece bathing suits that were in style a hundred years ago.  Rodney takes them clothes shopping.  They return poolside wearing very skimpy bikinis, followed by Rodney wearing a speedo.  The DVD includes deleted scenes, cast and crew information, and actors' interviews.  The actresses who play his five wives are interviewed while they're wearing their bikinis.  I really respect that!",997574400,47,1231,4.754716981132075
1375642,5,B00004YKS9,One of the funniest movies that I've seen in a while.  I loved it.,997142400,2,66,3.7142857142857144
1375643,4,B00004YKS9,"To Buy or Not to buy, will it be an asset to your DVD collection, or will you watch it once and forget it?
Yes people its safe to say that since your here, you like Dangerfield's type of comedy.  This film delivers fresh routines of Dangerfields trademark style, and although not a ""big"" budget film the likes of Ladybugs, Back To School and Easy Money...etc., it will still make you laugh.
If your a fan of Dangerfield, this is a good purchase and you will enjoy it a couple times.
Andrew Dice plays a Mafia underboss in the film, although his perfomance and jokes are nothing outstanding, its still a little funny looking at him. The writers could have done much more with his character, it is obvious his character wasn't written for him specifically or the director wanted to keep his performance second to Dangerfields.
Very little cameo perfomances by other up and comming comics, so don't expect much.
The film looks like a ""Made for TV"" movie and also looks like it was shot using video... possible to lower production costs.
Overall if you like Dangerfield, youll like this movie.",990835200,8,1089,4.642487046632124
1375644,3,B00004YKS9,"The only major key elements saving this comedy is Dangerfield's amazingly sarcastic humorous jokes and facial expressions,the lovely babes who play his wives, and the the tongue-in-cheek humor on a certain religion. Otherwise, the story is forgettable. Andrew Dice Clay again plays a typical role as memorable as his acting career.
As for the story itself, it's about a construction developer from L.A. who purchases land in a Mormon town-community to build a ski-lodge resort. What he did not realize was that in bidding and gaining the land he would also inherit several wives from the previous landowner who has since passed away (it's a major part of the community's religious tradition). He,himself must also become a Mormon in order to join the township as a citizen to own the land. The rest involves crooked bankers/loan officers, mob king pins based in Las Vegas, and uptight conservative Mormon town folk...
Despite all the films flaws, it's Rodney's humor that delivers every time. My only recommendation for any true die-hard Rodney Dangerfield fan is to skip this 100 minute flick and watch his stand up performances on the Jay Leno Show. At least on the Leno Show Rodney cuts to the chase and gets to his comedy gags !...
This comedy flick rates 3 stars...One for Rodney,One for the babes, and One for some of the other miscellaneous antics and gag-jokes !",975715200,4,1370,4.935064935064935

I only lasted 20 minutes (waiting for anything redeeming), but they were the worst 20 minutes of my life, except for when I was deathly ill from food poisoning. If I had finished the movie, maybe food poisoning would have been the better option. Rodney Dangerfield (who I thought had long retired before 2000) wrote this movie, and it feels as dated as a one-hit wonder band from the 80's playing today. The sexist jokes and the painfully obvious setups would be right at home in 1984, but come across completely out of touch and pass&eacute; in 2000 (even more so in 2016). Sadly, Rodney looks as old as his jokes and very unhealthy. I read a review that there is a scene in which he strips down to a thong, that mercifully, we did not get to.

1376028,4,B00004YKS9,Funny,1461024000,,5,5.0
1376029,5,B00004YKS9,"Selected this as a Prime viewing because Prime does have a lot of great films that didn't get the publicity they deserved, and this by far was one of them.  My wife and I are very socially liberal and intellectual, and have to say that this is Rodney Dangerfield at his best.  Originally we selected the film because we were thinking it was good for just a simple laugh, but the humor had an unexpected range with Rodney's clever and poignant one-liners, well placed slapstick and deadpan moments that were absolutely riotous, unexpected though perfectly placed classic Vaudevillian moments, surprise appearances from a number of comedy's greatest performers (won't give any spoilers, you'll just have to see for yourself/yourselves) , and the humor was even at times cerebral with a surprisingly considerate and respectful view of marriages in the Mormon Faith with the kind of balanced attention feminist causes deserve without alienating the guys from an ironically named character portrayed by one of comedy's greatest actors (she's also been a great dramatic performer too) with the political license to deliver a number of little life lessons all genders and orientations can appreciate with a lightness that would help a lot of people get along together a lot better.

It's important to note that the film never directly asserts that it's ""poking good clean fun"" at Mormon marital traditions by mentioning the word ""Mormon"" , but as are often the two greatest tenants of great comedy ""jokes that are hurtful aren't humorous at all"" and ""only the truth is funny.""

The fact that this is a pre-911 film shows; the world is diverse and full of hope, the economy is good, people give each other a helping hand, and social progression is even touching the lives of those in small town America.  If you miss the late '90's and early 2000's despite some of society's shortcomings at the time (let's face it, Justice Kennedy did a beautiful thing for all Americans with his finding in the the June 2015 Supreme Court case, and many will forever be grateful for honoring American Freedom and our nation's Constitution as it is intended to be understood), this film nonetheless reflects many other values of progress and working together in the spirit of the humane respect we all must show to  one another as diverse individuals while maintaining the ability to come together for common causes by doing the right thing.  There are many social aspects to the way all of the characters present that show us all many of the good and positive values of the earlier part of the last decade and the latter part of the decade before it that everyone needs to grab hold of again by way of their actions towards one another that are actions of ""inclusion"" instead of ""exclusion"" and ""division"" as many people now practice in daily life.

Case in point; there's a land deal issue that doesn't relate to the general plot summary of the movie (not going to spoil it by being specific), but is actually an important part of the film's story in presenting what some land developers might consider a moral quandary when there is absolutely no question what the right thing to do would be, and Rodney's character does come through by doing the right thing in the spirit of what it means to be a true American ""Honest and True!.""

Rodney's character's honesty also furthers the humor of Rodney Dangerfield himself because let's face it, we love Rodney's comedy because he doesn't have an internal filter of any kind as his comedy shows by always speaking his mind in the most delightful, ironic, and direct ways only Rodney Dangerfield can deliver while simultaneously making it impossible not to laugh.  :D

1376158,5,B00004YKS9,"I believe My 5 Wives is one of the funniest movies starring Rodney Dangerfield that I've seen yet.  I watched another Rodney movie where he went back to school (in fact, Back to School is the name of it) and Rodney's humor in that movie doesn't touch the more upbeat and hilarious style performed in My 5 Wives.  Perhaps there was some kind of restriction in place back in the mid 80's that wouldn't allow us to witness Rodney's *true* side (since My 5 Wives is clearly more joke-oriented).  Who knows.

As you've probably figured out, the storyline is about Rodney becoming religious and specifically a polygamist.  He inherits 5 attractive women and basically takes over a small town with generous tips and charity donantions thanks to having the money to do so (thanks to a top-notch laywer and a divorce settlement that turns in his favor).  At first the townspeople accept him with open arms despite his offbeat, ""always quick to blurt out a witty remark"" style of humor but later on when they find out he's been spending counterfeit dollars (unintentionally unbeknownst to even Rodney) well, things change in a hurry.  My favorite part is probably when the girls take a trip to Las Vegas and turn into naughty girls!  The skiing/snowmobile segment at the end -despite being *extremely* exaggerated- is another high point.  Actually Rodney executes several hilarious lines while riding in the back of a garbage truck.

I had no idea that was Andrew Dice Clay playing the role of the tough Italian guy, haha.  I forgot all about HIS style of comedy- more raunchy!  I recall his standup routines in the mid 90's and how my dad and his girlfriend were reluctant to let me watch them given my young age and the inappropriate topics he was discussing, but they ultimately gave in since I was a teenager at the time.

I swear, Rodney's at the top of his game in this movie.  Without giving away the actual jokes, a certain one about holding open elevator doors, a false allegation involving his ex-wifes chest, terrible cooking and having to bring Tums for the ants, to the joke about stimulating the wrong female body parts... he's flat out *awesome* in this movie.

I could seriously listen to Rodney's well-constructed style of humor all night long, haha.  I HIGHLY recommend My 5 Wives.  Oh sure, the actual plot is pretty weak but it's all about Rodney so none of that should matter.",1341446400,,2387,4.713253012048193

1376162,4,B00004YKS9,"You have to admit it: Rodney Dangerfield chose an offbeat & provocative subject to do a comedy on. And what's funnier than having Rodney--the ""no respect"" guy--marrying five young & beautiful wives? It's a premise that's a gold mine of laughs! Rodney plays Monte Peterson, a real-estate contractor who comes across some prime land to build a ski lodge in Utah. The catch: In order to use his land, he has to join the Mormon religion...which automatically gives him his many wives! His purchase immediately raises the ire of a shifty banker (John Byner) who happens to be in a ""stronghold"" partnership with a Las Vegas gangster (Andrew Dice Clay, beautifully cast) who has a secret land scheme that will turn the community upside-down. But Peterson's got his own problems: A trip to Vegas to treat his wives goes awry when both the city's fast living & a gung-ho feminist author (Molly Shannon) quickly corrupt the girls, opening up their eyes to women's lib. Worse, Byner sends his portly minion to Vegas in hopes of catching Peterson smoking or drinking as proof to ex-communicate him.
Rodney's likable & in top form in this one, rattling off some terrific one-liners, and getting into mischief as usual. The one flaw is the action sequences. The jail breakout, with Rodney riding in a trash bin, has some obvious stunt double work; and the ski chase is marred with stunt work that's obviously not Rodney. This kind of stuff gives the film a ""B-movie"" feel. Still, I laughed from start to finish...and that's good enough for me!",1252368000,,1529,4.817490494296578

It's not as commercialized as Back To School but there's no reason to forget about it.

AND it didn't cost me over $3! :)",1250467200,,160,4.129032258064516
1376164,5,B00004YKS9,"This is Rodney true to form and a real hoot of a movie. I think it was his last really funny story about a man with
the ""problem"" of inheriting five wives. Lots of ab libbing. I found this movie by chance as I do not remember it in theaters but is a real find if you are a Rodney fan. He always puts smile on me even when he says nothing at all. And have to say I relate to his practical thinking many times. A good clean comedy the whole family can enjoy!
I think he was one of the best comedians of our time. And yes, he finally gets respect at the end. Add this to your collection!",1231632000,,584,3.834710743801653
1376165,3,B00004YKS9,"Rodney slows down in this apparently direct-to-video movie, but it's an amusing take on the always-popular guy-who-inherits-bunch-of-babes plotline.  Here, Rodney is a would-be ski lodge builder who finds that to buy some Utah mountain property for his lodge, he has to adopt the local splinter Mormon beliefs.  That somehow includes taking three wives, and they become five.  He gets some tired gags out of how he has to bed these five beauties, then he takes them to Las Vegas, they quickly become liberated at a seminar, and help save Rodney from a couple smalltown hustlers including a banker played by John Byner, fronting for a mob guy played by Andrew Dice Clay, who wants the property for his uncle, played by Jerry Stiller.  Lots of Dangerfield gags, many of them heard many times before, a chase scene in which Rodney's double bests the bad guys, and all turns out well in the end.  Lightweight Dangerfield, but, heck, I like the guy and it's among the better of his lesser efforts.",1203811200,7,992,4.811764705882353

He also helped many younger comedians, many of whom are in this movie, by providing a platform (Danderfield's Comedy Club and his movies). But to enjoy this movie, you have to love Rodney. It's trite, sexist, the acting is terrible, and it's not that funny overall. RIP Rodney. Love you man.",1510444800,,342,4.444444444444445
