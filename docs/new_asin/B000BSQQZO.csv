8355244,2,B000BSQQZO,"This ""series"" ran for 3 seasons in Britain. Or ran for three ""series,"" i.e., three years. It can get confusing, because what we call a ""season"" in the U.S. is called a ""series"" in Britain. In any event, it ran three years, six episodes per year. So this box set contains 18 episodes total.

It's an uneven show. Some scenes are gritty and mean-spirited. Sometimes the show tries to be heart-rending and heartfelt. Then at times it's more of a comedic farce.

You have a former prostitute who loves her grandkids, and is terrified of losing them. Other prostitutes with kids, whom they love. Another who's trying to track down the kid she gave up for adoption. Some of these prostitutes try to form a cleaning business. A serial killer prostitute, whom we're supposed to sympathize with, because her father abused her as a child.

Lena Headey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B01H2JPTDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>) is in eight of the episodes She plays a dominatrix. She veers from cold, to quirky, to loving, to friendly, to business-like, to tear-struck. No emotional consistency. Ditto most of the other characters.

Headey's dominatrix is in love with a prostitute, who commits suicide. Soon thereafter, Headey is making goofy faces in a kareoke bar, as if she has not a care in the world. Sometimes Headey smokes opium in a public restroom. Other times she's all cleaned up, looking pure and innocent. Overall, her character looks too clean. No signs of living a hard, drugged-addicted life on the streets -- although her character allegedly ran away from home at age 12, and has been living on the streets for, oh, the past 10 years.

There's a nasty, borderline psycho cop who's insanely in love/hate with a prostitute played by Cathy Tyson (who seems to be replaying the character she played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mona-Lisa/dp/B000EDWLNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mona Lisa</a>. Tyson's prostitute, like Headey's, is all over the emotional map. At times Tyson appears to be acting in a serious drama. Then when a former client leaves her money, Tyson acts all goofy and silly, as if she were in a sitcom version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Woman/dp/B00081U7HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Woman</a>. Especially farcical is how the dead client's nephew tries to legally void the Will by entrapping Tyson in sordid acts, and Tyson's wacky retributions. Then she suddenly stops being selfish and materialistic, and defends the rights of working girls, as though she were in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norma-Rae/dp/B000059HAN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norma Rae</a>.

Another prostitute is a mean-spirited thing, until she's unexpectedly recruited to be a social worker. Then she's all public-spirited, sacrificing for the good of others.

There are a couple of shocking murders (filmed as serious drama), followed by farcical attempts to hide the body. Ha ha.

I guess there's supposed to be a feminist theme that runs through this show. The men are worse than the women. We're supposed to root for the prostitutes, but they're a pretty sordid, unpleasant bunch. Which should clue you in as to how sordid the men are. (Corrupt cops, child molesters, sadistic clients, violent pimps, murderous ex-husbands, etc.) If you're a man, and you want to see how horrible you are, this is a good show to watch. If women are awful, then bad men are to blame. Women, no matter how criminal or deceitful or violent, are victims of male malevolence.

I did learn some English terms. In Britain, a John is called a Punter. And a Pimp is called a Ponce.

This is an overall ugly series, with uneven, unrealistic characters. No, I've never known a prostitute, or a pimp, or even a social worker or a cop. But I assume that, like all human beings, they each have some emotional consistency. Which is widely lacking among the characters of this series. The tone and themes of the show are all over the map. Of course, I don't blame the actors. The writers and directors are to blame.",1473120000,,4213,5.457757296466974
