He watches it with daddy everynight before bed...I think Dad loves it to!  LOL  I am so excited to find some on DVD.  This show has all the good muppet parts of Sesame street.  Alot of Bert and Ernie, Grover, Prarie Dawn. I only wish sometimes that it was longer....HAHA",1335312000,,378,4.253521126760563
8270441,5,B0018PH3I8,"I bought this video to share with my granddaughter who is 18 months old.  I do the little exercises with her and she
just loves it!  The exercises are very simple but it does get her moving and not just staring.  She loves to JUMP!",1320883200,2,231,4.088888888888889
8270442,5,B0018PH3I8,"We love all ""Play with me Sesame"" DVD's  They are hard to come by as there are only about 5 on the market.  My son loves the sesame puppets.  He doesn't quite get the original sesame street b/c it has alot more songs with popular artist and real people interations, but he loves the puppets. So, play with me sesame is perfect for him.  He loves them!",1294531200,,351,4.1940298507462686
8270443,4,B0018PH3I8,"If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed it... We popped this exercise-oriented Sesame Street collection in, and my little girl (who still likes to say ""hi"" back when video characters say hello to her) jumped out of her chair when Bert and Grover asked her to do some calisthenics... ""Look at me jump!"" she chirped.  The next day, after a swim class, she showed me how to do the breast stroke: ""Ernie showed me how to do this on the Sesame Street video!""  I kid you not.  So, this educational DVD was a success, at least in this neck of the woods.  I still have a hard time with the new voice for Ernie... but there was only one Jim Henson, so what are you gonna do?  If you're looking for a fun kid's video that promotes good health, diet and exercise choices, this is a mighty fine option.
