3566272,5,B001F8KOGQ,"(* SPOILERS *)

Though this was one of my favorite shows when I was in high school, I had missed the majority of the episodes and was eager to catch up. I had waited several years to find the entire series on some kind of home video format, and here it is! After watching the whole series from beginning to end, I noticed that each season had its own distinctive character. It was as if they hired new writers and directors for each season. So, instead of reviewing the series as a whole, I'm going to break it up by season.

Season 1 was the weakest of the three seasons, though it still had its moments.
- It seemed strange that the first episode involved Henry's life and career hanging in the balance - this seemed more appropriate for a season finale. I think the first episode should have been more devoted to establishing Alec's and the Black's relationship.
- The Catherine and Pierre characters, while likeable, really did nothing for the show. In fact, they are completely written out of the show after the first season and are never mentioned again. It was never explained why two people from France were in the U.S. training for show jumping - not racing - at Alec's farm. Perhaps the writers wanted to make the show more appealing to girls? Forget Catherine, give me Alec any day! :)
- There wasn't a lot of plot continuity from show to show. For instance, in one episode Catherine has a boyfriend we've never seen, she gets engaged, and he turns out to be the bad guy by the end of the episode. Then we never see him again.
- The good things about the first season: it has the better actress playing Alec's mom (more on that later) and it devotes an episode to Alec getting an eating disorder. TV shows rarely touch upon eating disorders in men, so kudos to the Black Stallion!

Season 2 was a big improvement over the first.
- The voice-over narration by Alec is introduced, providing more insights into his character and his relationship with the Black.
- More importantly, what really improves the series is the introduction of the Nicole character. She has the right amount of spunk to be a perfect foil for Alec and Henry. They also give her her own plot line of trying to find her missing father. This adds continuity to the series that the first season lacked. Luckily the show doesn't keep us hanging and Nicole is eventually reunited with her father.
- What bogs this season down is the ""crisis of the week"" format. Just about every episode involved either the Black being kidnapped, an accident, someone trying sabotage the Black, someone trying to take the Black away, etc. It got tiring after a while. You would think Alec and Henry would have hired a bodyguard eventually.
- Also, Alec's mom went from a young, vibrant woman in the first season to an old biddy who worries about Alec getting hurt all the time. Yes, they changed actresses but they could have at least kept the character the same. Luckily she only appears in a few episodes.

Season 3 was probably the best season in terms of overall quality of the show.
- The pacing is noticeably slower, but in a good way. The writers and directors take the time to really develop the characters. Without a big crisis every week like the second season, we get to see Alec and Nicole's relationship blossom from friendship to romance. The way this is done is very gradual and natural, so it doesn't feel awkward when they finally kiss and go out on a date. It was very brilliantly handled.
- More importantly, we see the deep bond between Alec and the Black. This bond, though always there, is really brought out in the third season.
- Nicole's character softens considerably. Now that she's found her father, she smiles more and dresses better. I was so worried that they would get rid of her like they did Catherine, but instead we get to see her grow as a person. I sort of missed the old Nicole with the chip on her shoulder, but it was nice to see her mature.
- When the show moves to New Zealand, I thought for sure the show would jump the shark. Instead, it only got better! And I really loved Nate - the actor they got to play him was very natural.

One thing to be aware of when watching the episodes is that they are presented in order of production, not airing. Some of the continuity between episodes in kind of out of whack. For instance, in one episode they are trying to find Black Tide, and then in the next we see when he gets kidnapped. The two should have been reversed.

It's a shame the series ended after the third season, especially considering it got better with each season and had really hit its stride by the end.",1314403200,10,4618,4.452718676122932
3566273,5,B001F8KOGQ,"I can relate to this horse.  I know it sounds funny, but I can relate to this animal which is strong and caring and at times stubborn like we all are at times.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the love this kid Alex shares with this animal is extraordinary.  I like the country settings, ""Ah the simple life"" and the teenage plots.  I watched some of these on cable.  I got the set last week and I'm enjoying looking through it.  I'm starting with season 3 because that's the one I think I saw way back when I was a teenager in the 90s.  Okay, I'm not that old, but I do enjoy seeing those 90s styles and ways of dress, many of which I still think are cool today, but that's just me.  I remember having a big crush on the character played by Marianne Filali, I used to tune in just to watch her.  But now I see her for the cute girl that she was and realize that most likely shes my age now. I like her role and Mickey Rooney ain't bad either, I think it would be more interesting if it were Mickey Rourke but then again it wouldn't be family friendly either and Mickey Rooney does do a fine job as an old Bastard who gives a damn about this kid, this horse and this girl.  Being in France doesn't hurt either, but I distinctly remember them being in New Zealand, I'm sure as I watch more I'll see the episodes I saw.  I remember being really dissappointed when I couldn't find it on cable anymore and not till the internet did I realize that it was discontinued what a loss, but I'm glad its all here in one set to enjoy throughout the course of your life.  Its a family thing.  Its a horse thing. Its a nature thing.  I'm so glad I bought it and it arrived just in time for the Kentucky Derby!",1304467200,2,1692,4.042042042042042
3566274,5,B001F8KOGQ,"I bought this collection for my daughter,niece, and also for my mother in law. My mother in law only had season one and the kids loved going to her house to watch the black stallion so I bought them each a collection. They love the black stallion so it a great value for the entire collection.",1292198400,,293,4.25
3566275,5,B001F8KOGQ,"This is probably the best horse tv show ever, and finally in one collection. I can't say much about the extras and details, as it was loaned out to someone who is working thru it and may never give it back, but the first season was excellent. Eventually I will start poking them to return it, as I saw the series when it was broadcast, and they didn't, as there was no cable in their area at the time. Some of the horse stuff was silly, notably the tattoo on the leg thing, everyone knows you tattoo the inner lip, not the leg, but most of it was very good. And, hey, Micky Rooney, he actually knows about horses, not many actors do, these days.",1288051200,2,645,4.168
3566276,5,B001F8KOGQ,"This set is awesome! My son is an avid horse lover, rider, and caregiver. He asked for this set for his birthday. It arrived within just a few days and put a huge smile on his face. He did however, while telling me all about this series, say that it was produced in the 90's so the people dressed funny and had funny hairdos....gotta love children...I was raised in the 90's lol. But according to him, it is a super great series that he watches over and over",1268697600,4,458,4.215909090909091
3566277,5,B001F8KOGQ,My daughter found some of hese videos at the local library and enjoyed them so much that we bought this set for her 8th birthday.  She has not watched anything else since receiving this on 11-1-09.,1258502400,,197,4.472222222222222
3566278,5,B001F8KOGQ,"My son is a huge fan. He watches these DVD's all day. I was happy to find a collection of the entire series, after finding a few DVD's in our local Walmart store a couple of years ago. These are fun for any horse fan.

3566279,4,B001F8KOGQ,I enjoyed the whole series. There were a couple of discs that had problems playing. Maybe it was just my player. Otherwise everything went fine. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a black stallion's fan or fellow horse lover.,1224460800,4,237,4.666666666666667
8301304,5,B001F8KOGQ,"Mickey Rooney has been a fine actor for 70 (80?) years. He started as a small child, then became ultra-popular during the late 30s in the Hardy family movies. He became so popular that his character took a step up from ""just one of the family"" in the early movies, to THE star of the movies later on, with the rest of the family supporting the stories written around his role, Andy. Later on he was a victim of his own popularity .. so many movies in the role Andy Hardy type-cast him.

Mickey made sort of a late life comeback with ""The Black Stallion"" film, playing the crusty, at times self-interested trainer. Here he reprises that role ten years later in a three season TV series. ""The Black Stallion"" is about a fast, tough horse and his close relationship with Alex ... his rider, owner, and friend. The Black Stallion was introduced in a series of books by Walter Farley in the mid 20th century. They were extremely popular in their day, and are now considered classics by many. His son has continued the series, writing several more books about ""The Black"", including prequels that tell the story of The Black before he met up with Alex. If you liked the movie and this TV series, I would recommend that you find them. Most are available at school and public libraries.

Of course, as TV series will always do, in these shows you'll quickly lose the plots, if not the flavor, of the original books. However, the stories are interesting, and The Black always comes through for us in the end, which is why we are watching him! Mickey Rooney, always the pro, delivers a fine set of performances that his long time fans will enjoy. Richard Ian Cox (Alex) has gone on to an impressive list of roles in the last 20 years doing a combination of starring, voice, and guest star roles in movies and television.

When I bought this series last summer, the entire three seasons sold for less than twenty dollars, which I thought was an incredible bargain. I see that they are (as of the date of this writing) up to thirty-five dollars ... almost double what I paid for them. That is still not bad for three seasons of a good TV series. Many series sell for that price per season. However, you can get new copies through resellers for ten or eleven dollars less, so even with paying shipping you can save a few dollars that way.",1503360000,4,2325,4.465882352941176

8301308,4,B001F8KOGQ,"I love the Black Stallion book, I love the movie and I love this piece of awesomeness! It may have the obvious mistakes and cheapness of the average after-school shows, but it also has the charm and innocence that only the old shows and films seem to have. Also, this show stars Mickey Rooney (God rest his dear old soul) and Richard Ian Cox (InuYasha!). You can't beat their acting.
I like to think this show as the horse-lover's addition of ""McGee and Me"" (it doesn't have the wise-cracking cartoon character, but it has jazzy soundtrack and a young main character learning important lessons) and a more child-friendly version ""7th Heaven"" (it has obvious family relationships, friendships and romance than you can see grow throughout the seasons).
What I really like is that this show has some pretty mature topics, like sexism, drinking and anorexia. There are also hidden connections to the books Walter Farley has written.

There are three seasons and each has their own flavor.

For me, this show's biggest problem is not the fact the Black changes breed from country to country or the fact most of it has little to do with the books. It's because of missing characters and little continuity. There are really likable characters from the first season that disappear completely with no explanation as to where they went. Even going back to old locations in the second season, you can tell things at a lot different.
There are also times I feel Alec is rather selfish when it comes to the Black. The good side to this, though, is that you can see him mature and become a little less protective of the Black.

I highly recommend this to horse lovers, those who love the Black Stallion franchise or love watching those cheesy old shows.",1401667200,,1739,4.732673267326732

8301310,5,B001F8KOGQ,"We really enjoyed this series.  However, I would not recommend it for someone very young or emotional about when animals are in danger.  Everything comes out fine but at the time, you are stressed.",1366761600,,197,4.764705882352941
8301311,5,B001F8KOGQ,my children just love to sit around and watch the adventures of the black stallion such a good family show I grew up watching them and now my kids enjoy them. I just bought the ultimate collection cant wait to get it.,1364860800,,217,4.190476190476191
