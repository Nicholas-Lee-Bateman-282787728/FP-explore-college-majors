Bitch Run! and Hobo With A Shotgun are your thing, it just might be worth giving this a try.",1466553600,2,257,3.9615384615384617

8684734,4,B00OTADKSQ,"It was of course the title that caught my eye and Amazon reviews suggested that it was worth checking out.  Bring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman is definitely the sort of film to watch when you want some weekend exploitation cinema.  I found it a bit like a low budget version of the 1970's gang film The Warriors in the way the various gangsters each seemed to have their own schtick.  A favorite scene of mine occurs when our hapless hero Santiago tries to buy a gun and it's obvious he knows nothing about firearms.  And then, there is the title character; she is not a woman one would easily forget.  Bring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman will never be hailed as a cinematic masterpiece, but it is a fun movie.",1435708800,2,725,4.262773722627737
8684735,5,B00OTADKSQ,"Latino Exploitation doesn't often make it mainstream  so when Bring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman appeared out of the blue I had to take a look.

The movie is surprisingly fun. A flash in the pan gangster film it uses certain movie and video game mechanisms to add flavor to what might otherwise be a standard low-budget run and gun movie.

The centerpiece of the film is Santiago, a DJ who works at the club of a notorious Chilean gangster. As you can expect he eventually ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time and volunteers to bring in the Machinegun Woman in exchange for his life. The woman, La Mujer Metralleta, of course is the badass of all badasses and is not caught that easily.

The film is cleverly structured like a Grand Theft Auto style video game with each sequence treated as a level that Santiago either passes or fails. Title cards are inserted for each level at the beginning and at the end of each to indicate pass or fail (and he fails a lot of them). Its a bit cheeseball but works to make the movie more fun.

On top of that, every main character in the movie is given a value indicator when they appear on screen. Like a video game, it gives the audience an indication of how important/deadly each character is, and also shows just how deep Santiago is getting into the s*** as his value continues to grow while his skills continue to suck.

To my surprise Bring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman was a lot of fun. With a run time of 73 minutes its probably just long enough to enjoy without getting old or boring. If you need something fun and ultra-violent to watch on your night off you can do a lot worse than this indie Chilean gangster show.",1432857600,4,1689,4.29559748427673
8684736,3,B00OTADKSQ,"The film opens up with Latinexplotation and all the feel of a 70's drive-in feature. The opening kill scene was great, but the film quickly quiets down. Machine Gun Woman (Fernanda Urrejola) is an expensive deadly paid assassin. She is the former girlfriend of an Argentine crime boss who has a price on her head, but only ends up getting his guys killed who go after her. When his club mild mannered DJ (Mat&iacute;as Oviedo) overhears the problem, the boss gives him 24 hours to get the head of Machine Gun Girl or else...we are going to come up with a weaker plot point.

The sound was dubbed, but the chapter names which popped up on the screen were still in Spanish. It had some violent scenes, but most of the actual violence was off scene, afterwards we see the results. The film had some swearing, one sex scene, and front loaded extras nudity. At 73 minutes, it seemed long.",1430092800,,883,4.51875
8684737,5,B00OTADKSQ,"A gem that is not to be overlooked. Even with subtitles, this clever film is well-worth a watch. This woman is hotter than her tropicale of Cookin' Chile. MGW employs many plot twists-and-turns, with a chuckle around every corner. Don't mess with this woman, as she is definately the epitome of femme fatale'.",1429920000,3,309,4.849056603773585
8684738,4,B00OTADKSQ,"This movie was made precisely for the people who would do that. It's about 70 minutes of fun where a nerdy guy who spends all his free time playing video games ends up in a (purposely designed) Grand Theft Auto scenario. The guy really reminded me of Zachary Levi's character Chuck Bartowski from the TV show ""Chuck"". Anyway, he gets tasked to: bring his boss the head of the Machine Gun Woman. Said woman shows up occasionally to kill people and is always wearing that outfit on the cover. A lot lower-key than the Robert Rodriguez films that doubtless inspired it, but you're not going to get bored. Trust me, I have the attention span of a rabbit. Hella cool little Latinxploitation film.",1427155200,2,691,4.626016260162602
8684739,3,B00OTADKSQ,"If the title doesn't quite do the trick, the cover of the DVD should tell you all you need to know when figuring out whether Ernesto Diaz Espinoza's new film Bring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman is for you.

It's a wantonly corney, sub-Rodriguez affair that transposes 70s blaxploitation to modern day Chile and plonks a Grand Theft Auto vibe on top of it - a number of the scenes track cars through traffic from behind the rear window.

You hear a lot of complaints that modern action films ever more closely resemble video games: this one goes out of its way to - but the superimposition of the GTA look on a dented toyota stuck in Satiago rush hour traffic is kind of the point - in any case it's an amusing conceit.

Matias Oviedo has fun as geeky DJ thrust reluctantly in between dastardly contract-killing mobster Che Longana (Jorge Alis) (amusingly subtitled as ""Che Sausage"") and his uzi toting ex-moll (Fernanda Urrejola), who signs off her texts ""MGW"". Now that's class. Actually - given that ""Machine Gun Woman"", in Spanish, is Mujer Metralleta, that's some sort of weird continuity prolapse - but it's cool all the same.

Urrejola is predictably magnetic in the role - with a body and clobber like that, it'd be hard not to be - and while Bring Me The Head of the Machine Gun Woman isn't quite as funny as by rights it ought to be, and the editing is a bit rough in places, the appropriately pulsating cheese of Rocco's soundtrack keeps everything well oiled and moving along: at 75 minutes there's certainly no chance to get bored.

Good stuff.
