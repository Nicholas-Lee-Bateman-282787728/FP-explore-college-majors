I knew the music of this movie which was really memorable, and looked for the movie for 35 years. When I found it, I had to buy it to hear the music in its entity. No, I was not disappointed. I loved the movie and music. I recommend this for the real movie lovers.",1368144000,,500,4.376344086021505
8063560,5,B0009NSE60,"'The Railroad Man' (1956) is an example of the quality of distinction that the Italian's brought to film projects of the 1940's & 1950's. This style of neo-realism is elegant but also faithful to an individual's dignity and also engrossing.

Pietro Germi drew me in with his performance of the somewhat helpless, railroad engineer drawn into a disordered home and family mess that he somehow has to confront and unravel.

The setting and locale of Rome, is an instant hook to draw one in and in this case, the story, plot line and acting are all first rate. The Black and White film itself is brilliantly shot stressing both the compact streetcar with the backdrop of the desolate, bleak neo-realist landscape of Rome.

I wouldn't dare give away any plot details, as the best parts of the film are the absolute surprises but I must warn that 'The Railroad Man' is just as engaging or juicy in any part of the film. It will keep you wondering what you would do in a similar situation.

I found myself thinking about this film days after I saw it. Highly recommended.",1359590400,,1065,4.619047619047619
