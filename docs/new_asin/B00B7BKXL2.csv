8563579,5,B00B7BKXL2,"I just feel Jennifer Galardi is the whole package. Her work really shows how you can add extra accents, a little more hip here, a little more shoulder there, and how to use the floor to really get more muscles exercised than you would from other workouts. If you listen to her, you'll find muscles you never knew you had. Some complain that her choreography is too complicated but that's one reason I like it. I have to work harder and give myself a lot of time just to get the dances down so it takes me a long long time. But the challenge is great.  I think I'm getting a deeper more meaningful workout with her guidance.",1479168000,3,623,4.279661016949152
8563580,5,B00B7BKXL2,Wow ~ I can FEEL the work out within 24 hours of doing it! These are awesome to do one 10-minute session at a time or mix and match several to meet your energy level of the day. Jennifer Galardi is the BOMB!,1462406400,,207,3.8372093023255816
8563581,5,B00B7BKXL2,"Jennifer!  You need to do many more Yoga DVD's!  This set is perfect for anyone that isn't afraid to sweat.  I used to be 325 lbs.  I am currently down to 260.  I do the yoga DVD the most, & believe me, in the beginning I could not get into half her poses!  But now I can do most of all 3 DVD's but there is still room for improvement as my body changes.  I am thrilled with Jennifer Galardi, I first found her on Comcast Cable when she did free Yoga On-Demand.  She expects you to work, but also offers the ""alternate"" poses for beginners so everything is possible with altered positions.  My flexibility is amazing considering where I started.  I LOVE this set, & constantly look for more of her yoga.  (Hint: The dance DVD is serious work but you are having so much fun you don't know it until you see how much sweat you leave on the mat. :)  So get moving with Jennifer!",1442016000,2,874,4.136904761904762
8563582,3,B00B7BKXL2,"I was disappointed for my own reasoning.  The dancing is good however the workout as a whole is not that energetic.  There is a lot of slow pace and warming up that goes into the final routine which only lasts a couple of minutes at the end of each 10 minute segment.  I have only done ""Dance in 10"" so my rating is on that one alone not the Yoga or Tight in 10.",1415664000,,362,3.864864864864865
8563583,4,B00B7BKXL2,"Although I've always liked Jennifer Galardi as an instructor (e.g., her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Fat-Blasting-Dance-Mix/dp/B000GEIRAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix</a>), she tends to produce mainly cardio and/or ballet videos neither of which are a main focus of my fitness regimen.  I thought I might click with Jen more in this DVD, which offers a series of strength-focused workouts, each about 15 minutes in length.

Jen works out alone in this DVD in a pretty purplish room with open windows in the background.  She is teaching live to upbeat music.  In her brief introduction, she explains that that each of the four routines on the DVD features ten exercises that are performed for just one minute.  Jen uses several pieces of equipment, including a medicine ball, a Pilates or other small squishy ball, a resistance band, and a mat.  The Main Menu lists each of the segments that I have broken down below.  NOTE: for each workout, the moves get progressively more difficult.

ABS (15:42)
Jen uses both the medicine ball (about 4#) and the Pilates ball for this workout.  Here is the list of exercises:  1) standing crunch, 2) standing lower pelvic crunch, 3) standing oblique crunch, 4) standing roll downs, 5) half side plank oblique twist (on floor), 6) inclined rows with ball, 7) inclined drop backs with Pilates ball, 8) bicycles on elbows, 9) knees in/out and crosses, and 10) bridges.  Jen concludes with quick stretches both on the back and on the belly to finish.

UPPER BODY (17:08)
This workout uses the band for the first half, and the moves are as follows:  1) alternating pull back (band), 2) front and side biceps curls (band), 3) side and front shoulder raises (band), 4) double arm back row (band), 5) tricep kickbacks (band), 6) plank with high/low holds on mat, 7) airplane, 8) alternating arm/leg raises to swimming, 9) cobra, and 10) push-ups.  Jen finishes here with a brief kneeling stretch.

LOWER BODY (16:04)
For this routine, Jen is barefoot; she states that she is incorporating her favorite moves from ballet and Pilates.  She also uses the Pilates ball here.  The exercises include the following:  1) plie squat, 2) semicircle squat, 3) mini arabesque to rear, 4) quad kick to front with squat, 5) releve in first position, 6) squat side-to-side, 7) on mat, wide clams, 8) inner thigh lifts, 9) prone hip lifts, and 10) isometric ball squeeze with hip lift.  Jen concludes with lower body stretches on the floor, including thread-the-needle and a hamstring stretch.

TOTAL BODY (15:55)
This final segment again uses both the medicine ball and the Pilates ball.  Here is the sequence of moves:  1) squat jumps (holding med ball), 2) seated torso twists (holding med ball), 3) karate kicks, 4) mountain climbers to side plank, 5) wood choppers (holding med ball), 6) push-ups, shifting med all from hand to hand, 7) ab crunch (with Pilates ball under back), 8) pulsing side plank, 9) elevated bridge, and 10) elbow plank with rear knee lift.  To conclude, Jen stretches the arms, performs cat/cow, and finishes with some additional seated stretches (about 2 minutes total).

For the most part, I enjoyed these workouts.  I liked that Jen used strength equipment other than the usual dumbbells (e.g., the resistance band and the medicine ball), and I appreciated the short length of the workouts.  I was less enamoured with all of the plank work--I know it's good for me, but I wish Jen had been a bit more creative (as she was in the ABS routine).  Overall, however, I think I will use this DVD regularly, and I would recommend it.",1380931200,8,3676,5.043046357615894
8563584,4,B00B7BKXL2,"I reviewed the DVDs as soon as I received them, and I was under the impression that each disc would have just one 10-minute workout that included the warm-up, a mini-workout routine and the cool-down.  I literally want to spend just 10 minutes a day exercising!  I was not disappointed at all, though.

My favorite workouts on each DVD are:

""Dance in 10"" - Cool-Down
""Tight in 10"" - Total Body Blast (this one's no joke--it works the ENTIRE body!)
""Yoga in 10"" - Tension Tamer

The other segments are good, too, but I can see myself doing the ones above more often. I can always go to the other options to add some variety and to keep from reaching my plateau.",1368144000,4,661,4.385245901639344
8563585,5,B00B7BKXL2,Excellent! I love Jennifer Galardi's videos so I jumped at the chance to buy this set. She does not disappoint!,1360108800,6,111,4.6
