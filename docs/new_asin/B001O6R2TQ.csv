8561765,5,B001O6R2TQ,This is my must watch TV show every season. I found this show by accident during the middle of it's second season run on the Showtime channel.  I ordered what I thought was the first season to watch from Amazon from the beginning it the show and ended up ordering the UK version and was very disappointed... I didn't know that It was two different versions of the show. The UK show doesn't come close to the American version. I've turned so many people in to this show that I should be getting a check from the television show . It a great show with a lot of heart and emotions. Just prepare yourself for a rollercoaster ride is emotions when watching. You won't be disappointed,1473292800,,678,4.380952380952381
8561766,5,B001O6R2TQ,And I love the American version!  There is something sweeter and more genuine about the English version of this show. The characters seem more down to earth and vulnerable. And the little town is a character unto itself.  I had to buy a new DVD player to watch it - since the English version is formatted differently -- and it was worth every penny.,1368057600,2,349,4.4375
