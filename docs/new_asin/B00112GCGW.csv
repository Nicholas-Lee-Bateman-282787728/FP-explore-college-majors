8239885,5,B00112GCGW,"Mini series from the mid '70's with David McCallum playing the role of Allen Breck Stuart.  This is a really good version of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Kidnapped"" and ""David Balfour"" books.  David was still a fairly young actor at that time, so for you U.N.C.L.E. and NCIS fans you will get to see this fine Scottish actor in his prime.  Highly recommended.  Note- it is Region 2 only, but well worth the effort if you have a DVD that will play it.",1443225600,2,447,4.414634146341464

8239887,5,B00112GCGW,"This is the most authentic version of these books (Kidnapped and David Balfour) I've seen. David McCallum makes the stories come alive.
My copy came with a sticker claiming it was the ""complete and uncut"" version. Unfortunately, this isn't true. There are at least two scenes that have been removed and one of these explains David's penniless condition when he is landed in the Netherlands.
I've wanted to order this movie for years, but since it was only available in the PAL format, I had to be patient. I bought a Pioneer DV-610AV DVD player that changes all 6 DVD formats to USA format and that took care of the problem.",1333756800,4,624,4.63063063063063
8239888,5,B00112GCGW,"By far the best version of Kidnapped ever made, this has not been available since its original airing in 1979. The fact that is now on DVD in the European format is a break-through and I can only hope that it will be released in the US format soon.",1318464000,5,248,4.081632653061225
