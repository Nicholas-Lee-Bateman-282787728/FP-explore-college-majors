2334435,5,B0009XEVFI,"I really don't understand the sudden stream of negativity concerning this Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue special feature.  This was designed over 20 years ago to help kids stay far *far* away from drugs.  Trust me, I remember 20 years ago all too well.  I was in 2nd grade, and the teachers would always *every* *single* *day* beat into my head (and into the heads of my classmates) that drugs are extremely bad and that you should stay away from them no matter what.

The interesting thing here is that, this collection gathers all the popular cartoons from 20-30 years ago and miraculously combines them to create interesting results.  In fact, going in, I wasn't expecting much out of this 25-minute cartoon.  I thought all these cartoon chaaracters would just make a quick appearance, say ""Drugs are bad"" and that would be it.

No, these popular cartoon characters actually come together to tell a fantastic, realistic and well-explained story concerning the real life dangers and side effects of using drugs.  Garfield and Alf communicate with each other, the Chipmunks and Winnie the Pooh strike up a conversation, Bugs Bunny and the purple evil ghost imitating the voice in your head encouraging you to give drugs a chance have their own predicament going on, etc.

The main focus however, is on a teenage boy and his younger sister, and how a family can be torn apart as a result of a drug user (the teenage boy) being reluctant to share that he's addicted to drugs.  This is an honest and realistic side that you will NOT find on your Saturday morning cartoon shows, and it's honestly quite surprising hearing the Chipmunks in particular mention the name of these drugs.  Take these cartoon characters, wrap an exciting and meaningful story around it, and now you have something worth paying attention to.

Too bad so many of my classmates never got the message and became hooked on drugs anyway.  Should have been paying closer attention to this well-made cartoon!",1321401600,6,1975,4.842261904761905
2334436,5,B0009XEVFI,This movie explains the Say No to Drugs theme in a way younger children can relate to. It might be scary for children under 10.  My kids loved the characters and the way they help the girl. I would recommend it for anyone trying to drive the drug free message home.,1320451200,2,265,4.196078431372549
2334437,5,B0009XEVFI,"...or children of the 80s who want to reminisce. It brings together a cast of cartoon characters that you never though you'd see in one feature: the Baby Muppets, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Winnie the Pooh, The Smurfs, Alf and many more. This is a great leftover gem from the war on drugs. Our heroes band together to convince a teenage boy to drop his drug habit before his younger sister picks it up by following his example (with hints of Reefer Madness-esque anti-marijuana propoganda). Its a really fun ride and as far as I know the characters have all of their original voices. There is even a musical number written by the geniuses behind The Little Mermaid score, Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. Really enjoyable if don't try to take it too seriously. Just say no!",1310169600,3,778,4.644927536231884

Cartoon All-Stars To The Rescue was a half-hour animated drug prevention special starring many of the popular cartoon characters from American Saturday morning television shows, which was simulcast on April 21, 1990 on all three major American television networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS), most independent stations, as well as cable networks Nickelodeon and USA.

Cory (voice of Lindsay Parker), is worried about her older brother Michael (voice of Jason Marsden) because he's started acting differently. When her piggy bank goes missing, her cartoon tie-in toys come to life to help her find it. After discovering it in Michael's room, along with his stash of drugs, the various cartoon characters proceed to band together and take him on a fantasy journey to teach him the risks and consequences a life of drug-use can bring.  The villain of the story, besides the drugs, is Smoke (voice of George C. Scott), an anthropomorphic cloud of smoke with a mafioso-like appearance and personality.

The ""Cartoon All-Stars"" that appear in the special, from 10 different franchises, are:

* The Smurfs: Papa Smurf, Brainy Smurf, Hefty Smurf (though Smurfette is seen on the poster and VHS cover, she does not appear in the special).

* ALF The Animated Series: Alf.

* Garfield and Friends: Garfield.

* Alvin and the Chipmunks: Alvin, Simon, Theodore.

* The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: Winnie the Pooh, Tigger.

* Muppet Babies: Baby Kermit, Baby Piggy, Baby Gonzo.

* The Real Ghostbusters: Slimer.

* Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck.

* Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Michelangelo (although he appears in the special, he is not shown on the poster or VHS cover).

* DuckTales: Huey, Dewey, Louie.

The special was distributed on VHS videocassette by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (Disney), but it was only available for free rental, not for sale.  This is probably due to the PSA nature of the special and the legal issues with the licensing of the characters for profit.  Make a video for free rental only, no profit; sell it, and there's profit.  Video stores were given a poster featuring the VHS cover art (you can&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/buy-a-11-x17-reproduction/dp/B000JW1Z62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">buy a 11""x17"" reproduction</a>) to display in their windows or on their walls to advertise that they had the tape available for free rental, hence the ""Rent It Here FREE!"" banner in the upper left corner of the poster.  I saw the special when it aired back in April 1990 and secured one of the rental VHS tapes from the ""previously viewed"" section of the video store that used to be in my town.  I still have that tape, and will never sell it.",1299715200,3,3412,5.662082514734774
2334439,5,B0009XEVFI,"I'm an elementary teacher that loves to use this movie. It explains the dangers of drug addiction not only to the body, but how it affects the lives of an entire family better than anything else I have used. Even if my fourth grade students have seen it before, they still enjoy it. Being a little older only brings to light more knowledge and understanding. I wish it would be updated in a DVD format so its life would last longer. Many schools only have DVD equipment now. Please someone....this is a worth while project. Without continual education to the facts about drugs, our children will be sucked in.....this should be shown to every school aged child year after year, adding more information about the drug culture as they are mature enough to understand. Education is one of the steps to prevention!!!!!!!",1215907200,11,816,4.753521126760563
2334440,5,B0009XEVFI,"This movie is amazing! I remember watching it in elementary school, then making my folks rent it for me to watch at home. This movie should really be shown in ALL schools worldwide!!! It's SO much better than those boring movies they got out now about saying No to drugs. This one is enteraining & holds the interest of a child. Especially one who recognizes most or all the characters.",1146182400,5,386,4.5285714285714285

8069552,1,B0009XEVFI,"This is one of the worst specials. There's a million anti drug PSAS. Why are these beloved cartoons talking about drugs. Seriously you got Bugs Bunny, Garfeild, Michelangelo, muppet babies and more. They should be making you laugh not scaring you and giving you nightmares. If you want to make a animated PSA fine make up characters, don't use popular characters. I bet the special is more scaring to kids then helpful.i love animation and I find this offensive. For a cartoon it's too realistic and cringeworthy. Thank god there's not a sequel to this mess and most of my favorite animated characters are not in it. If you are a huge fan of animation, you may find this offensive. It's like ""this kid have drug problems laugh at him."" It's worst than one coarse meal. That is ten minutes. Imagine that for a half hour. People who laugh at it needs help. It should not exist!!!! I can write a book on how offensive this is. The moral fails. It basically says if you do drugs you favorate characters appear. Gee is should of did drugs years ago. (Sarcasm). They should of made up characters. FYI thank god Huckleberry Hound,Snoopy, Yogi bear, Bart Simpson Homer Simpson, Optimus Prime, Augie Doggie and Daddy Doggie, also pretty much all the Hanna Barbara are not in this train wreck or my childhood will be completely destroyed. Don't watch it for the sake of your childhood because they act out of character and can be a jerk to the protagonist.",1439078400,,1446,4.63035019455253

8069555,5,B0009XEVFI,"Thank you so much. This had been a favorite of my son when he was little. He had recently asked if I still had it, but I had given a bunch of videos away in a bag and it must have been in there. I felt terrible. I was very happy to find it again. We really appreciated the DVD copy that was sent along with the video. How nice was that? It renews my faith in people.

8069558,5,B0009XEVFI,Watching your favorite Saturday morning cartoon characters lecture you about drug use is one of the most surreal experiences you can have as a child. I can only hope this comes out on DVD one day - it's truly an experience!,1337731200,2,223,4.463414634146342
