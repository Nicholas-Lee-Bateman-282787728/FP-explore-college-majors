8019434,2,B00020ETP0,"A girl is found murdered who attended the St. Teresa girl school. The world's worse detective is assigned the job. His oafish ways are a bad copy of 70's film detectives. He suspects three girls who were part of her group. As the body count grows the suspects narrow down.

The quality of color in my copy was fairly washed as if they transferred it from a bad copy. The acting was bad and the translation had me scratching my head at certain plot points that didn't seem to matter. The film follows a standard 70's plot for this genre. Not really worth watching.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or sex. Nudity.",1361577600,,607,4.45945945945946
8019435,1,B00020ETP0,"This copy of ""Virgin Terror"" by Saturn Productions is the worst DVD I have ever bought.  It's obviously a bad copy made from a VHS tape that was made from a beaten-up print and it has the worst sound I have ever come across. I challenge anyone to figure out what the actors are saying.  This DVD should have come with subtitles, because unless you are an expert lip-reader and are fluent in Italian or French or German you will not understand a single word spoken by the badly dubbed actors. If you pay more than 50 cents for this DVD, you're getting ripped off. Beware of the cover with the knife for the letter ""T"" and gravestones in the background.",1204329600,2,651,4.371900826446281
8019436,3,B00020ETP0,"VIRGIN TERROR (aka: TRAUMA) is about a killer preying on young teenage girls. The victims all have a connection to some horrible past event. This one is low on excitement, but high on violence and nudity. So, I found it at least entertaining enough to watch again. Worth a look...",1146614400,,280,4.62
8019437,2,B00020ETP0,"This is another name for a movie called 'Trauma'; Directed by Albert Negrin, featuring Fabio Testi (not to be confused with the Dario Argento movie of the same name). Since it has been a while since I have seen this movie, I will give the teaser from a movie review guide: ' A private girls' school is located close to a village where murders are occuring and where rich men's fantasies are catered to by the populace.' I do not remember too much about the movie other that the plot dragged and when the person responsible for the attrocities was revealed, it seemed just like a random way to end the movie. My viewing of this movie was from a VHS copy. I do not know the quality of the DVD, but, considering that it is from Saturn, I do not have high hopes.-Bob",1086566400,4,762,4.298611111111111
