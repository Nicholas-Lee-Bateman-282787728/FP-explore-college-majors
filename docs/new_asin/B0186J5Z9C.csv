Nothing different with this 10 Anniversary than the original other than the digital copy included, which is a huge deal for me, I use mostly digital.

7540960,1,B0186J5Z9C,"Don't be fooled by the new packaging. This is the SAME 2006 disc slammed into new packaging with a digital download code. There is no new content, no new transfer, no new encoding. Just the same disc you've likely owned for 10 years. Perhaps that's what they're celebrating, selling the same old disc for ten years straight. Happy anniversary, Fox. AVOID THIS RELEASE.",1453766400,40,368,4.857142857142857
7540961,1,B0186J5Z9C,"DO NOT BUY! What a ripoff! Fox should be ashamed of themselves selling this crap!  All this is, is the EXACT same disc as the one previously released. Exact in every way.  The only ""10th anniversary bonus"" you get with this is a digital HD copy and a slipcover.  Promptly will return. If you don't own it at all please do buy this one.  This movie is one of my favorite guilty pleasures. The movie is 4/5, this new blu-ray is a 0/5.  Where is the new encoding? Looking for a 4K remaster? Well forget it!

7540963,5,B0186J5Z9C,"The Devil wears Prada Is a pretty good movie, I thought it was pretty good. The Movie is about this collage girl Andy(Hathaway) Who gets a job at a fashion magazine as an assistant to the big editor Miranda(Streep) whos is a boss from hell. no matter what andy does she can't please her boss. and on top of it her relastionship is on the line. will she stand up to her boss and fix her relastionship or will she let it all go down the toilet. Well if ya wanna know go rent it. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1449792000,2,532,3.9813084112149535
7540964,5,B0186J5Z9C,Nothing 10th anniversary about this but i didn't own it before and i like that it came with a digital copy for only $10.,1522108800,,120,4.041666666666667
7540965,2,B0186J5Z9C,Received a regular packaged Blu-ray like you could buy when it first came out.  Not an anniversary word on it or any indication that it was an 10th Anniversary edition.  Very disappointed.,1522022400,,188,4.84375
7540966,2,B0186J5Z9C,Not what I expected,1521676800,,19,4.0
7540967,4,B0186J5Z9C,"The only good things about this movie are: Meryl Streep's and her quotable zingers, Stanley Tucci, Emily Blunt's breakout performance, the clothes, the Madonna songs/fashion montages, and Anne Hathaway's performance as Andrea Sachs...that's about it. If the movie could somehow have made sense without Andy's pouty boyfriend (Adrian Greiner as a struggling sous chef who can't seem to find a hairbrush) and her shallow, hypocritical ""friends"" (they LOVE the free gifts she brings from Runway but turn on her viciously when she begins to don couture in her efforts to do the best job possible in her ""pay your dues"" turn as an abused assistant to the tyrannical Miranda Priestly), it would have been better. Andy's ""friends"" don't seem to understand that she has taken this thankless, low-paying, and often humiliating job (which is also TEMPORARY) because it will open countless doors for her to pursue her real career goals. True friends wouldn't (or shouldn't) be so vicious and hyper-judgmental when one of their own needs them most (like when they're working in a thankless, low-paying, and often humiliating job for an evil boss). Still, watch it for Meryl, Stanley and Emily if nothing else!",1520985600,,1197,5.143589743589744

Basically the 10 year anniversary came up and they resold it just adding in the digital copy. There's NO new content. My DVD from 10 years ago has more bonus material than this new one. I was REALLY REALLY upset because this was the 2nd copy I have purchased hoping for the cover art to the left & with new content but no, I was just dissatisfied twice ",1519430400,6,459,4.157303370786517

7540977,1,B0186J5Z9C,"Soooo disappointed in the audio quality. I meant to lodge a complaint and get my money back, but I bet its too late.

The audio is mastered so that the soundscape is incredibly loud, and the dialog incredibly quiet. I have to listen to the DVD on a BLARING #24 volume when I normally use #11 or 12 in order to hear the actors speak, and even then Ive had to watch a few times to catch all the lines.

If I hadnt already been familiar with the movie, Im not sure how clear I would have found it.....",1507420800,,498,4.02020202020202

I love the move but I'm disappointed. There is no point in even saying its 10th anniversary edition if it's the same movie inside and out,1485734400,,302,4.410714285714286

7541015,5,B0186J5Z9C,"The movie was extremely delightful. My husband and I had caught the end of it on cable - I had seen it before, he had not. But those few minutes of viewing (we didn't watch it to the end), made us decide to go ahead and own it. We have a good sized DVD library, and are pleased as can be to have added this gem to our collection. Excellent storyline, well acted - and what CAN'T Meryl Streep do? All of the actors are great in this movie - and who doesn't love a mad and crazy romp in the fashion industry?

Bravo!",1480982400,,514,3.9423076923076925

7541019,5,B0186J5Z9C,Have seen this dvd several times & still keeping it to see again.  Streep is fabulous but so is Anne Hathaway.  Nice moral ending for all those out there that may think the grass is greener on the other side.,1474934400,,208,4.175

7541021,5,B0186J5Z9C,"Well, this movie was an education:  first of all it is based upon a very real person whom courtesy forbids naming - a viciously abusive individual who is notorious, very famous and very successful.  This movie tells the story of a smart small-town girl who makes it her mission and life to wrestle the world of high fashion to the mat, and then stomp on it:  she succeeds.  During the course of the year she works for a magazine which is a stand-in for ""Vogue,"" she changes completely, loses a very old friend and makes one new one, ditches her soul and then comes back to get it.  I don't think this movie could be made today:  we're too politically correct now and this character would be faulted for her character, which proves itself strong in the end, and her standards, which are high and to which she finally returns.  But I value it for these very reasons.  (Watch for a cameo appearance from 'gorgeous Gisele!')",1473724800,,920,4.5

Emily Blount and Stanley Tucci, as well as Simon Baker, put on fine performances. The hideous clothes,she wears, provided some humor. Still she strikes me as an unambitious character that was unsuitable for the film. The business characters were far better than the personal characters in her life. Towards the end she abandons one world to return to her ""friends"". It should have ended when she decides she doesn't belong to this industry and walks away from it. Instead somebody insisted on a happy ending to it all. It was a terrible decision which robbed the film of a poignant moment..",1529971200,,705,4.739837398373984

This movie drips with humor and comic drama and honestly I love it soooooooooooooooo very much. This film and its cast bring me joy whenever I watch and I am so psyched to have it as a digital copy now so I literally never have to go anywhere without the comfort of knowing I have this A+++++++++ classic in my very own pOCKET!
