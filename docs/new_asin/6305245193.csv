1004923,4,6305245193,"Ally Sheedy, David Carradine, Charles Napier (sheriff). This movie is not funny, it is somewhat exploitive. She hits a wolf on the road. She is brutally raped. There are quite a few murders with guns and explosions. There is a corrupt police force, I couldn't find anything funny. The sheriff is good in his part. It is very logical and real.  It is what REAL criminals would do instead of the usual bumbling mistakes in movies. Aren't you tired of people dropping guns?  The women are strong characters in most parts, still sensitive. The relationship between David Caradine and Ally Sheedy is interestingly written. It is Miss Positive people are good verses Mr. Negative, every man for himself. Guess which way it goes? The music is also good and fits the movie. Exec. Producer: Roger Corman",972604800,7,794,4.830882352941177
1004924,2,6305245193,"Following a fairly ordinary plot line (read humor): husband cheats, wife leaves, wife drives self into prison (metaphorically), Ally Sheedy reveals to us that the once highly revered Brat Pack's success quickly dimmed  during the early 1990s.  The film is packaged as an ""erotic""  film, but merely sinks into a casaul ""skin"" flick with an R  rating.  Watch mainly to see how far the Pack has fallen only to  (hopefully) rise again, as Sheedy recently has.",960681600,4,455,4.921052631578948
