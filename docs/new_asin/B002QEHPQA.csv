3966770,2,B002QEHPQA,"In Regards to THE BLU RAY

Here's an update, I just got this on blu ray, now don't know if I'm the only one but is anyone's copy of this movie the sound muddled in some parts and seem have to turn the volume way up in order to hear what the actors are saying? And grainy in some scenes, first time having a blu ray disc that is very sub-par. This really annoys me, because in the theater it was the same... muddled sound in some parts, loud in others, just curious if other people are experiencing the same thing??? Thought maybe the studio would have cleaned up the sound and make it more clear. That is Why I only give this Blu Ray disc 2 stars.

Anyways here's my review

I wanted to like this movie when I saw it in theaters, the trailer was good, strong actors, everyone loves Johnny Depp, And I like Michael Mann, and it was a historical piece, a look on crime wave of the 1930s.

Ok, so the movie was stylish, nice camera work, good acting from Depp and Bale, Bale actually not growling his lines like in Dark Knight and T4... hahaha.

This is what I had a problem with, a 2 1/2 hour or so movie condensing the crime spree of Dillinger and based on the book which is 500 pages or so that chronically and rightly depicts the events in true order.

The movie itself is so historically inaccurate, just so it fits on ""Hollywood"" storyline. I thought Mann would do a better job to get historical facts straight. I do understand there needs to be room for poetic license and all.

For instance: Baby Face Nelson is killed at the Little Bohemia Hide out by Agent Purvis, actually he is killed in 1934 in Chicago by FBI

Pretty Boyd Floyd was killed Oct 22nd 1934 3 months AFTER Dillinger is killed, not in the beginning of the film

The scene with Hoover and the Senate Sub committee did not happen until 1936

Ok you get the picture, there's tons more factual errors, and I know this is a movie based on true events and the book. Everything must be condensed and fit. The movie is enjoyable, with a nice blues soundtrack with Otis Taylor having 2 tracks on the soundtrack.

Again this is Michael Mann, who I think his best movie achievement was Heat, I did like Collateral, where those movies were character driven movies, where this just scratches the surface. Again it's Mann, style and action is his motifs and it shows here, more so with the action and events than with the characters.

What we get is, Yes Dillinger was a bank robber, yes he was shot outside the Biograph Theater, he seemed smug, and ruthless, seems this just scratches the surface here once again, thought this movie might go more into detail on who this man was, what made him tick? What we get is a dramatized over view of his exploits and not about Dillinger himself. Maybe I was hoping for a deeper story here. Depp was good with what he had, and Marion Cotillard is stunningly beautiful. If you want to know more read the book by all means. One reason to see it, the costumes, everything right from the 1930s, guns, clothing, cars, pretty cool.
I think a good gangster film with developed characters and strong story and good action... American Gangster with Denzel and Russell Crowe. I thought that was a terrific movie.

So over all an ok movie that could have been great otherwise. Just a real crappie bluray",1256688000,4,3291,4.384236453201971
3966771,3,B002QEHPQA,"Michael Mann is the master of crime dramas, that much is clear. Heck, The Last of the Mohicans was as far away from the genre as he could get and it still turned out to be a very good film. I had high hopes going in to see Public Enemies, especially with such a talent filled cast. Johnny Depp's acting chops are as strong as they have ever been. He doesn't overplay the part and at times seems a little too relaxed, but overall he captures the essence of the character nicely. Christian Bale has been better, but he brings the right amount of quiet intensity to the role of the man assigned with hunting Dillinger down. Marion Cotillard is beautiful here and I thought she did well with what little material she had to work with. I wish they would have gotten into the other characters in the gang a bit more and Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hoover had less screen time than I thought he would.

The pacing is a little slow at times, but there are a few realistic shootout scenes that are well down. A major flaw is that the timeline is out of order (Baby Face Nelson was actually killed after Dillinger is just one example) and it strays from historical truth at times. I can't quite put my finger on why I didn't love this movie. When it ended, I left the theater thinking that I was entertained, but also how forgettable it was. I expected more from such a good director and was hoping that the life of one of the country's most infamous bank robbers would have had more of an impact on me.

3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1256515200,3,1516,4.224137931034483
3966772,5,B002QEHPQA,"Depp plays the famous John Dillinger, if you haven't heard of him well that's sad because he helped the (what we know as) the FBI form and made the work bank robbery a common fad. He was an intelligent young man who started in Indian and moved cross country during the early 30's to make history. This film however does not play as a biography, rather a character summary. It gives us a look at Dillinger what he was like, as being in 2009 its hard to say, but Depp actually researched where he was born (Just a few miles from Depp's home town and found that he knew what Dillinger's accent would be like) After watching this movie I compared it to the real deal. In many books Micheal Man actually did make a film worth while historically (I have not seen any other Mann movies though) Mann doesn't go overboard this film actually feels REAL, like a Cinema movie, as if your in it so to speak. Trust me if you want a nice Gangster Movie, with by far the best actor in Hollywood Buy THIS! Also this movie shows another side of being a criminal its not always murder, sometimes its self defense.",1256515200,2,1094,4.315533980582524
3966773,4,B002QEHPQA,"A saga of one the most legendary outlaws of the 20th century and the lawman tasked to take him down.  This is the third try by Hollywood in detailing this story and Johnny Depp follows in the footsteps of Lawrence Tierney and Warren Oates.  It is worth your time though, if you have seen the other versions, you will have a sense of deja vu.  Depp as Dillinger and Bale as Purvis are excellent in this Michael Mann directed gangster film (and as a fan of James Cagney, it's nice to see one again.)  A curious piece of history, Melvin Purvis would, many years later, commit suicide with the same gun he killed Dillinger with.",1256256000,4,624,4.4
3966774,5,B002QEHPQA,I like gangster movies and sometimes you gotta wonder how they first came to us.  Public Enemies is a good example.  Johnny Depp plays gangster/bank robber John Dilinger.  I don't know too much about Dilinger other than he was killed at a movie theater and he was a movie buff.  Real-life gangsters are worse movie gangsters.,1256169600,2,325,4.75

3966798,5,B002QEHPQA,"This movie was, IMHO, Johnny Depp's best movie - he personified Dillinger with the requisite bravado, swagger, and invincibility that was true Dilllinger. The movie, I believe, is also very close to what history has recorded re Dillinger's life and his end - he literally never saw it coming. Just a great movie all around, and Marion Cotillard was also exceptional as Dillinger's girlfriend Billie. Stephen Lang was likewise exceptional - a very versatile actor - you would never think that he was the same guy who played Ike Clanton in TOMBSTONE. Well done all around, exceptional movie.",1505952000,,589,5.020408163265306

The movie fell short from getting 5 stars, because of the boring Dillinger character as played by Johnny Depp. He's a great actor, but not very good at playing gangsters, he tries to make the character look cool, but the result is a very corny and uninteresting Dillinger. Christian Bale character is OK.",1493856000,,436,4.589743589743589

Despite the star power of Depp vs. Bale, the film is just boring. It spends too much time humanizing the villain, while nothing develops for the hero. While the bad guy might be a big softie when not robbing and killing, hes still a bore. The shootouts are stiff, where two sides square off by firing back and forth, lacking the drama and development of the directors hallmark sequences of yesteryear.",1463702400,,517,4.7555555555555555

3966888,4,B002QEHPQA,"I felt this Michael Mann film was a fairly good and entertaining story of the man once called ""Public Enemy Number One"" - John Dillinger.

I thought Johnny Depp did a fairly good job of portraying John Dillinger while Christian Bale gave a creditable performance of his FBI nemesis - Melvin Purvis. The clothing, sets, weapons, cars are all period correct for the most part and very well done. The viewer gets a sense of life in the 1930's. John Dillinger was a very smart criminal and I think the Johnny Depp performance correctly showed that Dillinger wasn't the trigger-happy gangster that sprayed bullets around at every opportunity and, therefore, the violence level is lower than many rated-R films.

Does the film remain true to actual events? No, but it is quite close and gives the reader the basic ""highlights"" of John Dillinger's criminal career during that time when he captured the attention of the nation - and J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. michael Mann's direction is quite good, balancing action sequences, romance, introspection and the FBI's implacable pursuit of every clue or lead.

I thought it was an enjoyable movie and one that captured my attention and pulled me along with the story. Four stars.",1461283200,2,1214,4.912195121951219

Granted my son enjoyed it more than my daughter. It wasn't terribly gory and the violence wasn't too much for them even though some would surely disagree. For myself however, given the reviews I'd heard about it and the fact that my favorite actor Johnny Depp is in it, I thought the movie would be more thrilling. I was a little disappointed. A good movie all in all just not as good as I thought it would be. Less action packed than I had hoped. Still worth the money though.",1453680000,,654,4.15748031496063

This film is a pretty good movie compared to most of the others on Dillinger. I'm not a Depp fan, but his performance was very good, better than Bale's. One reason I liked the movie is that it's not too lopsided in favor of the FBI or Dillinger.

Public Enemies should have been an HBO miniseries, when you see what could have been and all that was left out this really seems like a wasted opportunity. This seems like more icon/actor worship (I'm sure everyone was already tired of Johnny Depp and his phony sense of ""cool"" when this was new), useless exercises in style, with very little story telling or substance. This movie was nothing more than a move for some actors to advance their career, get some approval from some supermarket magazine critics, then be promptly forgotten. The antithesis of everything a historical motion picture should be, empty and without consequence. If film producers continue to have their way, all of history will boil down to a glamorous run on the red carpet to the doors of death.",1419033600,2,933,4.8375

3967061,4,B002QEHPQA,"A life of danger seemed to be an intoxicating force that drove Dillinger more than anything. It was an addiction that drove him, an unstoppable trail of destruction between thrills. At the same time J. Edgar Hoover was consumed by a drive for power and a growing ego, and he would nothing stop him. And then there's Melvin Purvis, a man with brutal tendencies, driven by violence which he is legally allowed to indulge. Bring these three characters together in a series of encounters where their paths converge and you're in for quite a story. That's what we have here in this movie, watching it unfold to its inevitable conclusion, where so-called good prevails.

I think that Johnny Depp did a good job portraying John Dillinger and i also feel that the director did a good job recreating the time period and that the few action scenes in the film were done well (Especially the shootout at The Little Bohemia lodge),what i didn't like about this movie is that it drags along toward the end and i also felt that Christian Bales performance as Melvin Purvis was lackluster,also there was a fictionalized scene added to the film that serves no purpose (When Melvin Purvis visits John Dillinger in prison after he is captured) when i first viewed this film in the theater i was unaware of this but after purchasing the dvd and watching the special features it is mentioned,i would have preferred it if the director wouldnt have taken liberties with the story and just presented it as it actually happened..in ending this review I will say that Mann is a damn good director however this isn't his best work.",1405296000,,1257,4.666666666666667

Any longer and it should be two segments, any shorter and something would go missing.  Sadly, there were plenty of opportunities to leave a few of film on the cutting room floor.

Depp, all too often an overhyped actor, did a reasonably good job of playing John Dillinger, but in mnny ways his performance was overshadowed by Christian Bale's performance of Agent Melvin Percell.

That's just one scene though. the shootout at the Wisconsin hideout wasn't totally accurate but back then nobody really knows what exactly happened. I know Baby face Nelson was shot and killed in Barrington IL. but they don't go over that, and the movie wasn't about him anyway but they could've had him get away. overall this movie was just missing something.

But Johnny Depp's kerisma as notorious bank robber and outlaw John Dillinger wins me over in the end.  That is not to say that Mr. Bale isn't a match for Mr. Depp, playing an FBI agent who, like his boss, J. Edgar Hoover, seeks to put a modern spin on crime-fighting.  Though they rarely share scenes, their conflict during the hunt is always at the forefront and these gentlemen make the most of it.  From Depp's taunting diologue to Bale's determined stance, you'll always find yourselves wanting to know what happens next.  All the while, these men are surrounded by a great cast of supporting characters, though Billy Crudup ought to have gotten more screen time...oh well, I suppose the story couldn't accomidate.  Marion Cotillard plays more than a simple interest that Hollywood seems to require no matter what...properly fuses herself with Depp's performance, showing why these lovebirds were ""meant to be"".  A list of actors too long for this review make up a list of gangsters in John Dillinger's and other gangs who ran wild throughout the United States, making things as chaotic as they were supposed to be.  Overall, this is a great film about a character in history that anyone would love to learn more about.

Most of the dialogue was mumbled and difficult to understand what was being said, which made this convoluted script even more difficult to become engaged with.

I kept waiting for this movie to get better but it only become worse with time, and having Depp go into a theater to watch an old black and white movie, only seemed to be contrived for the purpose of creating a vehicle for the stupid ending line which was a quote directly from this old piece of vintage film playing in the movie theater, It just made the script look even more desperate than it was!

3967107,2,B002QEHPQA,"Been meaning to see this (due to JDepp really), but haven't gotten around to it until I saw the bluray for $5 and picked it up.  The movie itself is very, very slow.  I like to think of myself as a universal movie-lover.  I love movies, all genres, as long as it's good.  Combine that with my love of JDepp and you know I really tried to give this movie a chance.  But good lord, it was just so drawn-out and boring...I kept day dreaming and thinking about stuff and before I knew it, I was doing something other than paying attention to the movie.  Slow-paced movies aren't usually an issue with me, as long as they're good.  But this one just did not catch my attention at all.

Also, I absolutely hated the picture quality.  I got the bluray version of this and have never seen it in any other version, so I'm not sure if the bluray was just crappy or if the DVD and theater version are like this as well.  But it was extremely grainy and made everyone look way older than they really are.  At first I thought it kind of had that ""old time"" look to it (and maybe that's how it was supposed to be since the time period was supposed to be mid 20th century), but if that's the case, it just doesn't work out with the ultra crisp look of high definition.  Or it could just be the transfer...I really don't know.  Either way, the picture quality was horrid and so was the movie.  Between this one and ""The Tourist"" (and a few other recent disappointments), I'm starting to wonder if Mr. Depp is slacking on his movies knowing he'll get a good pay check anyway due to his big name.  =/",1384560000,,1582,4.209302325581396

3967110,3,B002QEHPQA,"The producers of this film would like you to think it is a modern version of the Untouchables, but anyone who has seen this film will tell you it's far from it. It's not that Public Enemies was a bad movies, but a lot of people panned it because they expected a lot more from a 100 million dollar movie, starting Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, and they have a point. The story was flawed right from the beginning because the true story behind it really wasn't that interesting. The filmmakers tried to get people to watch it, by saying that Dillinger and Purvis were comparable to Capone and Ness, but that's not true. In reality, they had almost no interaction with each other and in the movie, whenever they were together, all they did was shoot at each other. There wasn't any chemistry between them, because their supposed rivalry was a fictions element added to an otherwise true story. The film should have focused on infamous bank robber, John Dillinger, but instead it focuses on the FBI hunt for him and his life on the run, long after the bulk of his crimes had been committed. Johnny Depp portrays Dillinger in an attempt to go back to being a legitimate actor instead of a Disney puppet, and he fails miserably. This guy can be one hell of actor, when the role fits his personality, but John Dillinger does not. Depp is an emotionless mess of mumbled lines that almost completely destroy the film. Thankfully, Christian Bale was much better and far more interesting. Public Enemies had big expectations, an all-star cast, and a huge budget, but it turned out to be an average film. That's what had people so upset, because had this been an independent film, they would have been okay with it. The fact that Public Enemies was billed as the next Untouchables, but fails to deliver even a single memorable scene just destroys any credibility the film had going for it.",1384214400,,1879,4.611940298507463

3967114,3,B002QEHPQA,"Michael Mann has got to be one of my all-time favorite directors. While I admire Stanley Kubrick for his unique storytelling and Tim Burton for his undying attention to irresistible visuals, Mann won my respect for his exploration of modern realism. He never sugarcoats elements in plot and character development. Movies like Heat and The Insider are more true to real life than what you would expect. If I'm in the mood for hard-hitting realism, then I choose a film from Mann (and other directors in the same vein). The Insider, Collateral, and Heat are among my favorite films.

When I finished watching Mann's 2009 crime drama Public Enemies, I just felt good that I watched yet another film by Mann. But unfortunately, the movie itself needed some work. First off, the film felt very incomplete. Even if it centered on real-life robber John Dillinger and FBI agent Melvin Purvis during the downfall of the former's reputation, I wanted to know more about these characters. The movie seemed to lack proper character development because we don't exactly understand the character's origins very well. Perhaps if this had become a TV mini-series (as it was originally intended), then we probably would have had a clearer understanding of these individuals and their motives. Another problem is that the story starts right before Dillinger's downfall. It doesn't feel right to start at the beginning of his fall from grace because we don't know if we should root for this man or not. Plus, the romantic subplot between Dillinger and Frechette (played by Marion Cotillard) is not convincing onscreen. I just didn't feel the chemistry between the two, and even if Frechette was romantically involved with Dillinger in real life, I didn't think the romance in the film was necessary.

But Public Enemies isn't a terrible film. It still has some good qualities. The performances from Depp, Bale, and Cotillard are especially noteworthy: it's Oscar material right here. The look of the film is amazing: great cinematography is a plus. The sets and costumes look completely realistic: good thing no one overlooked the researching for this project.

I'd say that Public Enemies is a good film, though it's not perfect. I don't mind the few historical inaccuracies, but the major flaws in the film sort of turns me off. I do applaud Michael Mann and the cast and the crew for their efforts. This film might grow on me, but in the meantime, I give this film below a 7 (out of 10).

3967119,2,B002QEHPQA,"Highly reminiscent of director Michael Mann's ham-fisted effort in translating Stephen Harris' Red Dragon into his box-office bomb Manhunter, this flick deserves considerable mention as Worst Book Adaptation of the Decade. Handled by a less self-indulgent director with a broader vision, this could have easily been the Oscar contender that both Johnny Depp and Christian Bale had hoped for. Instead, we got another well-done Dillinger flick with a screenplay that unfortunately catered only to Depp's anti-hero worship of the major protagonist.

For those who read Bryan Burroughs' landmark epic, Public Enemies was one of the greatest crime narratives ever written. Succinctly subtitled 'America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI 1933-34', it was a panoramic view of an unprecedented time in our nation's history, picking up where antebellum bank robbers such as the James-Younger Gang left off. Though undoubtedly John Dillinger was the rock star with the flamboyant style fastidiously portrayed by Depp, there was also Bonnie and Clyde (whose own biopic didn't do badly a generation ago), the Karpis-Barker Gang, Pretty Boy Floyd (who lasted two minutes in this one), and Baby Face Nelson (who gets the honorable mention by Mann). If this would have gotten a Syriana-type treatment with the flashbacks and switch-tos that Burroughs must have been thinking of when he wrote this saga, we might've had a contender for Best Picture of the Decade, alack and alas.

Not that Johnny Depp didn't do a bang-up job as Public Enemy Number One, a role that the Pirate of the Caribbean had long coveted. He probably deserves kudos for the best Dillinger portrayal, but you can't do a whole lot with a worn and weary script. Mann should've called John Milius for advice: his own 1973 Dillinger starring Warren Oates was an awesome flick but, as he learned, Dillinger just doesn't go over big at the box office. Even Lawrence Tierney could've told him that. Oscar winner Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis and Award-winner Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette added star appeal but you just can't make a good meat loaf out of spam.

The flick appropriately starts off like gangbusters as Dillinger's gang busts him out of jail, while Purvis murders Pretty Boy Floyd as Hoover announces his career-making War on Crime. Shortly afterwards, the flick deflates as a series of introspections shows Dillinger to be a ne'er-do-well country boy with a head full of corn flakes. Bale tries to make the save as a tortured Special Agent trying to deal with Hoover's flagrant violations of the gangsters' Constitutional rights. Yet Mann drives this Titanic directly into the iceberg as the agents proceed to beat the snot out of the captured Billie in trying to discover Johnny's whereabouts. Women-beaters aren't big box-office, even if it's as great a flick as Raging Bull. We next proceed to the shootout at Little Bohemia, and when Mann fails to get his facts straight in killing off Baby Face Nelson, well, as we have seen, even Batman couldn't save this one.

The glaring omissions and greatest disappointment was not seeing the other death stars spotlighted by Burroughs' book. No one has revisited the Bonnie and Clyde saga since Warren Beatty, and a couple of quick switchovers might have worked wonders. Shooting Pretty Boy Floyd at the beginning of the movie was tantamount to Mann shooting himself in the foot, and obfuscating the Karpis-Barker Gang as bit players was probably the worst mistake of all. The cerebral Karpis was the last Public Enemy Number One, and he masterminded kidnappings and armed robberies that grossed twice the other yeggs' combined totals. The Devil's greatest achievement, it is said, is making people believe he doesn't exist. Most people don't know who Alvin Karpis is, and Mann might've set the record straight if he'd only got the story right.

For Depp, Bale and Cotillard fans, this is a solid effort for which these actors deserve recognition for putting over a registered stink bomb. For Michael Mann watchers, this ranks right up there with Manhunter as a classic book-to-movie fumble. For crime buffs and action/adventure flick fans, well, let's say this is better than Boys In The Hood...but not much.

That ranks Public Enemies higher in my estimation because I'm tired of seeing historical films that distort reality to the breaking point.

3967127,4,B002QEHPQA,"Good job. I would watch it again.

But it is worth mentioning that there were some problems and some have been mentioned by other reviewers. Mostly, the history was liberal cutting and pasting. This is not surprising in historical films. Also it is more about story than about character exploration. I would have liked more character exploration, but that is a matter of taste. Also I wish they had made it clear how gangsters could be heroes to large segments of the public in those years, when the economy was so bad and the banks were seen as the bad guys, and the cops were seen as being corrupt.

That said, this is more about the historical legendary Dillinger rather than reliable history. Yet I feel that the film was actually not so much about Dillinger as it was about FBI politics and Hoover's public relations. Or, it was well balanced between both.

A few decades ago it would have been very daring to go into this. Now we all know how Hoover was so relentlessly focused on developing the image of the FBI that he was misleading the public and even the elected politicians. Bureaucracy at work!! Good to see this sort of reality in films.

In this connection and with regard to historical accuracy, there is in fact good evidence that Dillinger was not killed in the famous theatre incident of popular history and featured in the film. Film critic Roger Ebert has a lengthy posting on his blog that he requested from an author who has written extensively on this. [...]
This would make for another really, really terrific film! Maybe someday Oliver Stone will make it!

Public Enemies could serve as a lead in to this film in that the Depp film does give a feeling for how desperate the FBI was to nail Public Enemy #1 in order to look good in the public eye and for budgetary reasons. So a coverup of the alleged fact that they killed the wrong guy is not only in accord with the published revelations that Ebert put into his blog, but it also would be quite understandable in terms of the personalities and politics involved.

Nevertheless, I liked Public Enemies. Well done.",1373500800,,2090,4.574866310160428
3967128,2,B002QEHPQA,"When I first heard that Michael Mann would be doing a film based on the John Dillinger story, I couldn't have been more excited. Mann is a great director, but in my opinion, his triumph was 1995's Heat, which I consider to be the greatest bank robbery movie ever made. The fact that he would be telling the story of arguably the most famous bank robber in American history meant that opening day, I was in a theater viewing Public Enemies. The moment the credits began to roll, all I could think was; ""well, that was underwhelming"".

The brilliant staging and cinematography that helped make Heat such a memorable film are replaced with close-up handheld shots which cut down on the dramatic spectacle of the bank robberies and shootouts, and the powerhouse performances of De Niro and Pacino are replaced with a clearly bored Johnny Depp, and a shockingly mis-cast Christian Bale.

I am personally not a fan of Johnny Depp, mostly as a result of his recent career, but I can't deny that he has given phenomenal performances in the past, and thus is fully capable of carrying a film is he puts his mind to it. However, he seems to be sleepwalking through the majority of the running time, remembering his lines well enough, but seeming to forget that an actor also has to affect the proper emotions to underscore those lines.

Christian Bale is another actor who has the potential to be great in a role, but his short-coming is his lack of versatility. Bale shines brightest when he plays characters who are detached from reality, such as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, and Trevor Reznik in The Machinist. However, he seems to flounder when it comes to playing the straight-forward hero, which is the role he is saddled with in Public Enemies.

Both actors prove to be completely incapable of assuming a convincing Southern accent, and nowhere is this more apparent then in the scene where Melvin Purvis (Bale) interrogates Dillinger (Depp). It is written as a scene that highlights Purvis' sense of duty, and Dillinger's amorality, but the fact that both actors' accents are so slurred and overblown makes the entire scene unintentionally hilarious.

The cinematography is probably the film's biggest short-coming, because rather then the big action set-pieces being meticulously staged and shot from a middle-distance to let the audience really absorb the spectacle, the majority of shots in these scenes are shot absurdly close, and many last for between five and ten seconds. This is meant to convey the frantic nature of the scenes, but it ends up becoming tedious very quickly.

Public Enemies had the potential to be a great American crime classic, but the execution is so botched that the only true appeal of the film would be for those morbidly interested in the Dillinger story, and even then the numerous historical inaccuracies will drive most away.",1373414400,,2866,4.886831275720165

3967132,5,B002QEHPQA,"""Public Enemies"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: No one could stop John Dillinger and his gang. No jail could hold him. His charm and audacious jailbreaks endeared him to almost everyone -- from his girlfriend Billie Frechette to an American public who had no sympathy for the banks that had plunged the country into the Depression. But while the adventures of Dillinger's gang -- later including Baby Face Nelson and Alvin Karpis -- thrilled many, J. Edgar Hoover made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy Number One and sent in Melvin Purvis, the dashing ""Clark Gable of the FBI."" However, Dillinger and his gang outwitted and outgunned Purvis' men in wild chases and shootouts. Only after importing a crew of Western ex-lawmen (newly baptized as agents) and orchestrating epic betrayals -- from the infamous ""Lady in Red"" to the Chicago crime boss Frank Nitti -- were Purvis, the FBI and their new crew of gunfighters able to close in on Dillinger.

The cast led by Johnny Depp (in an Oscar-caliber performance as John Dillinger), Christian Bale (as Melvin Purvis), & Marion Cotillard (as Billie Frechette) is excellent!

The music by Elliot Goldenthal (who also did the music to ""Heat"" & recently, to, ""Across The Universe"" (2007) is excellent! The cinematography by Dante Spinotti (who also did the cinematography to ""Manhunter"", ""The Insider"", ""Heat"", & ""The Last Of The Mohicans"", he also did the cinematography to the upcoming ""The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader"" (2010) is excellent! The film editing by Jeffrey Ford (who also did the film editing to ""Breach"" (2007) & ""Street Kings"" (2008) & Paul Rubell (who also did the film editing to ""Collateral"", ""The Insider"", & ""Miami Vice"", he also did the film editing to ""Transformers"" (2007) and its sequel, ""Revenge Of The Fallen"" (2009) is excellent! The casting by Avy Kaufman (who also did the casting to the upcoming ""25/8"" (2009), ""Brothers"" (2009), & ""Amelia"" (2009) & Bonnie Timmermann (who also did the casting to ""The Insider"", ""Heat"", ""The Last Of The Mohicans"", & ""Manhunter"") is excellent! The production design by Nathan Crowley (who also did the production design to ""The Dark Knight"" (2008, which also starred Bale and was directed by Christopher Nolan), ""Batman Begins"" (2005, which also starred Bale and was directed by Nolan), ""Insomnia"" (2002, also directed by Nolan) & ""The Prestige"" (2006, also starred Bale and directed by Nolan) is excellent!

The set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg (who also did the set decoration to ""Transformers"" & the upcoming ""The Rum Diary"" (2010, which is also starring Depp) is excellent! The costume design by Colleen Atwood (who also did the costume design to ""Manhunter"", she also did the costume design to the upcoming ""The Rum Diary"" & ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010, which also stars Depp) is excellent!

Manhunter- the original early 80's shocker that first introduced movie-goers to Hannibal Lector, the epic classic cops and robbers flick 'Heat', with Pacino and De Niro, and Collateral, which proved Tom Cruise could make a really evil bad guy. In his latest effort- Public Enemies, Mann has made a movie about John Dillinger that is the most factually accurate thus far. The film also has excellent location choices, hairstyles, cars, etc. from the era. Johnny Depp might not be as close a match to the real Dillinger as Warren Oates was in the 1970's version of the story, but somehow he manages to bring the very essence of who Dillinger was to the role despite that. Ben Johnson took on the role of Melvin Pervis in that film, and he was incredible. Christian Bale on the other hand is about as opposite appearance wise from Ben Johnson as you can get, yet he somehow manages to bring Pervis to life and he makes him much more human and believable than Ben Johnson did. This is easily one of Bale's best performances to date. Depp is always good, and he too gives a truly great performance. This film really does get the facts straight and tells the story the way it was always meant to be told. Public Enemies should get a few oscar nominations in all fairness, but it greatly depends on how strong the competition get's this year. It looks like this year might have some strong contenders compared to the past 4 years which offered some serious duds.",1367884800,,1655,4.613559322033899
3967137,4,B002QEHPQA,Some parts not true to history. But a good story line. Johnny Depp excels as Dillinger. Playing a part worthy of his acting abilities.,1367625600,,134,4.625
3967138,5,B002QEHPQA,Love this movie as some of it was filmed right here in our home town and down the street from where I live.  Really worth having on Blu-ray as it is much better.,1367625600,,161,3.878787878787879
3967139,4,B002QEHPQA,"One More film on gangsters, you will say, and what's more this extremely bad strategist John Dillinger. What can come out of that? The FBI will become what it is now because of his death which will be an essential argument for Hoover to get what he wanted, money, men, cars and weapons. That's how history is made in American: on violence and blood, be it the blood of Indians, the blood of black slaves or ex-slaves, or the blood of gangsters, even at times the blood of workers when they turn strikers, and along with this blood a little bit of Caucasian blood or American blood to pepper the bill.

This is the most important characteristic of this film: the cynicism of these legal killers in uniforms or without any uniforms but stars and other identifications, including dog tags. They have the right to kill because they run the risk of being killed. They are not better than the gangsters they are killing though the two categories are on the two sides of a road and it is always greener on the other side. Enjoy the pasture.

The rest is romance and romantic fiction unluckily directly copied from real life. So the gangster has a girlfriend and she will be the collateral sentimental damage of his escape, hunt and execution in front of a cinema after watching a film with Clark Gable, some Manhattan Melodrama, or some tasteless film of that type. The end of the film is by the way irresistibly sad because they let us imagine that the crowd that takes over the scene of the killing is giving free rein to their anger and joy. A postmortem lynching, in a way.

But we must say that after the prohibition and the repeal of this crazy amendment, under the New Deal on its way to solve a few problems, at a time when prisons were full, road gangs were long and busy building all kinds of public infrastructure with sweat, blood and hammers, the compulsory choice of going on the New Deal projects when you did not have a job and if you wanted your family to get some kind of dole, and that is called forced labor in my dictionary, at that time the only easy way for the mentally limited people who thought that weapons were the voice of God - if they could have done it they would have borrowed Gabriel's burning sword of flames - the only easy, was I saying, was to rob banks and use sheer brutality to do it.

John Dillinger is the symbol of this intellectually underdeveloped vision of crime and there is no glory in defeating that kind of brilliant for sure but totally dull general of the war against capitalism that only robbed banks and stole the money the poor workers had put in the coffers of these banks. No attempt is made to rob the state or to rob industrialists, just only nothing but uniquely banks, and money available at the wicket, at the counter, at the cashier's window, in the teller's till and a little bit in the main safe.

So do not be romantic about John Dillinger or his girl friend. They were only the puppets of their time.

The movie and roles are action-packed without being overboard, and you even get a bit of a love story thrown in without it becoming ridiculous or sappy or taking over the whole movie...which is touching and intriguing, given that he is a hard-core outlaw.

3967172,3,B002QEHPQA,"""Public Enemies"" offers a good director (Michael Mann), a couple of very good actors (Johnny Depp and Christian Bale), a solid supporting cast (featuring Marian Cotillard and Billy Crudup) and a Depression-era cops and robbers theme.  What could go wrong?

The movie begins with the breakout from prison of bankrobber John Dillinger (Depp), who promptly goes on a cross-country bankrobbing spree with his old gang.  J. Edgar Hoover (Crudup), the publicity-hungry Director of the FBI, sends his best man, Special Agent Melvin Purvis (Bale) in pursuit.  The chase turns ugly, as Purvis finds his men are outgunned and calls in more lethel lawmen.  The result is a duel to the finish, as Purvis closes in on a desperate Dillinger.

Mann never allows the movie to become black and white.  Dillinger is violent, but loyal to his buddies and to hatcheck girl Billie Frachette (Cotillard), with whom he carries on a romance.  Good guy Purvis is driven to uncomfortably ruthless methods to track Dillinger. In their one face to face meeting, Dillinger will tellingly observe that Purvis lacks the stomach for his job.

The movie flows from one stylishly choreographed action sequence to the next, and they are all quite violent.  Mann spends lots of time meditating on the Depression-era landscape of American, without adding anything to the meaning of the movie, which somehow gets lost in the violence.  ""Public Enemies"" is a cinematically stylish and entertaining movie that never quite figures out what story it wants to tell; cautiously recommended.",1356220800,,1546,5.144
3967173,5,B002QEHPQA,Johnny Depp was fantastic in this role.  I loved it. The love story was compelling and his speech about what she neede to know about him was memorable.  I didn't like the scene where the cop was mean to her.,1355616000,,207,4.15

The film is quite good far better than I had expected it to be.  I did not expect such an interesting love story between Depp and Cotillard.  Depp did an amazing job in portraying loyalty for his friends, a deadly steadiness in his 'job' and oozing charisma in every frame.  Bale is also a favorite who held his own as the conflicted good guy.

After viewing J. Edgar with DiCaprio I had a real appreciation for the frustration shown by an equally talented actor portraying the part Billy Crudup.

3967183,4,B002QEHPQA,"This reminds me alot of Heat, Michael Mann's other crime epic. And there were some very touching moments, highly evocative shots of the American landscape, very emotional moments.

Professional reviewers have said that it lacked focus and that is also true. I got the impression many times that something significant had happened, but I never could figure out exactly why it was since the actors tended to muffle their words. I never really got the urgency of why someone had to be here or there, so it didn't quite make sense when they were shocked by something or other.

Attention to detail is impressive though. Watching the documentary, many of the locations were shot on-location at the historical location, and the actors cast bore a physical resemblence to the historical figures, which just about no one would really notice but Mann cast them anyways.

It's worth watching. I enjoyed it. I do wish that more liberties had been taken for story purposes. Maybe merge a few characters, even change up the events as they happened.",1348963200,,1035,4.902857142857143

This is the first time I can remember a Johnny Depp or Christian Bale performance that had no charisma to it whatsoever. The film is not exciting enough to fall into the ""gangster film"" genre, and there is absolutely no insight at all into the John Dillinger character (or any of the other characters, for that matter), so it cannot be classified as a character study. So what is it? It plays like a series of unrelated vignettes from the last couple of years of Dillinger's life. Depp and Bale do not so much give wooden performances as they are given wooden characters by the script to portray. The film is way too long, as is typical for a Michael Mann film, and there is much in the film that could easily have been eliminated without loosing any coherence. Even Dillinger's famous death outside the Biograph Theater is just a ho-hum anticlimax.",1345593600,,1125,4.658291457286432

Johnny Depp's ethereal performance of Dillinger is just outright uninteresting and totally lacks an enigmatic presence he may have been trying to bring to the character.

On the other hand, Christian Bale's performance as Melvin Purvis is far more interesting with his dedicated yet restrained approach to catching up with Dillinger. There is a certain admiral element of subtle dignity that Bale brings to this role. That is what I like about this film.

Speaking of subtlety and restrained dignity, Stephen Lang's Charles Winstead plays a brief but pivotal role defining what law and order was intended to be bolstering Bale's performance as one of the special agents on Melvin Purvis' team.

I was weary about the fact that Johnny Depp was going to be in this because he is a hit and miss actor and I really didn't want him to ruin the role.

This isn't a family or date movie, unless you're into violence and lots of gun fire and dead bodies.
The story follows the infamous bank robber John Dillinger and his gang through numerous bank jobs and escapes from lock-up. In contrast, the story also follows Hoover and his recruitment of a the new head of the Chicago FBI office, as they tighten the net on Dillinger.
Obviously a great cast, set design, and wardrobe. Action scenes could have been better. Where this movie fell flat, is in the story. I wasn't captivated by either of the story's main characters. Sure, okay, they were interesting. But I wasn't drawn into their lives, like I should have been, especially with a story that has at its side, such rich history to pull from.

3967202,2,B002QEHPQA,"Watching Johnny Depp filter his charm through an almost comatose portrayal of American Gangster, John Dillinger was disheartening.  I miss the old Depp, 90's Depp, the Depp with serious acting chops; the Depp there was before Depp was a huge name.  Remember `Benny and Joon'?  Remember `Ed Wood'?  Remember `Donnie Brasco'?  UGH, he's seriously tarnished his own reputation by lathering on uninspired Tim Burton caricatures, but I was hoping that working with Michael Mann may do him some good.  Sadly, `Public Enemies' is flawed from conception onward, and Depp's `barely there' performance doesn't help any.

Aside from some sharp action sequences (Mann has always had a knack for sustaining tension within moments of pure chaos), `Public Enemies' suffers from lack of originality or inspiration, and it feeds off of old school clich&eacute;s in a way that doesn't pay homage, it merely insults.

To get into a long list of `no' here would be tedious and unnecessary.  I'll just jot down a few quick notes to explain my disappointment with this film.

First of all, the acting is just plain bland.  There is no real connection to any of these characters, outside of Billie who is brought to life by the amazing Marion Cotillard.  The only character who seems to be somewhat soulful or at least human is Babyface Nelson, and Stephen Graham (who was SO good in `This is England') plays him like a walking clich&eacute;, like he were trying to impersonate James Cagney, and it just doesn't work.  Both Depp and Bale come off stagnant; they barely register.  Bale is especially terrible here, showing no emotion and generating nothing from the audience.  When the film ends and they run a small blip of what happens to Melvin Purvis afterward, I didn't care.  The film didn't make him a real character; he was merely a prop.  The least said about Billy Crudup the better.  The production values, editing and cinematography were all fine; nothing special but nothing wrong either.  The editing was key to making those action scenes stand out, and I will admit that a few of the frames (especially with the brown tints and the glaring gunfire) were actually eye catching.  Still, the script was somewhat hollow and the character development of Dillinger was horribly manipulative.  In other words, Dillinger was a saint of sorts with a fetish for knocking over banks.  He is presented as a caring, kind, loving soul and you basically despise the law, who is depicted as woman beating Neanderthals.  I understand that good people do bad things because of circumstance, but this just seemed one-sided and unrealistic.

And that ending, with the theater scene and the `prolific' presentation of `Manhattan Melodrama' was simply stupid, and that final burst of violence looked incredibly fake.

At least Marion Cotillard was in this film.  She is a light in a dark tunnel, producing incredible light and stealing my heart with every spoken word.",1327363200,,2937,4.979466119096509
3967203,5,B002QEHPQA,"I have all the action Michael Mann films in my collection. Heat is one of the best movies ever made, and Collateral is simply awesome. Miami Vice is sub-excellent, but after watching it a couple or few more times it began to grow on me. Its one of those that the care and attention to detail and the intent were there, it just felt like things didn't come out quite perfect. But Public Enemies is fantastic. Superbly well done. I love movies that depict an entirely different era. The movie does the history of the time and the legend of John Dillinger justice, the scenery, the buildings, locations, vehicles are all accurate and the weapons on both sides of the law are accurate and authentic. All the actors from the top to the support walk and talk as if they were from that time. If you don't enjoy this movie as much as I do, I feel sorry for you.",1326758400,,853,4.3375

3967206,1,B002QEHPQA,"I walked out of the movie theater because in the 30 minutes I watched the film, there were so many bad facts that I could not bear it. I'm trying to watch the film in small bits because my friends say that it's a good film and doesn't say it represents the true facts. My problem is this: When they take the name of Mr. Burrough's Book ""Public Enemies,"" they have a responsibility to follow the facts of the book. Since that book was published, several other books with more recent and accurate facts have some out. Anyone familiar with the real story could tell you the true history is better than the drivel on the screen. The director and playwrights should never work again. If Mr. Burroughs had input to the production, he should be ashamed of letting them butcher the movie.

The acting is fine, I have to say Depp is convincing as Dillinger, but Melvin Purvis is so miscast, it's another crime. Purvis was a very short man and when he meets Dillinger in Miami/Tuscon (which didn't happen) he towers over Dillinger.  Baby Face Nelson does not die at Little Bohemia - his story of his escape was a wild one and would have made a great story.  Red Hamilton was not shot and killed there, either and may have returned to his native Canada, according to relatives, and lived out his life.  Carpis did not confer with Dillinger about his train robbery and his friends called him ""Ray"" not Alvin.  He co-wrote two books about his life as a criminal and his time in Alcatraz.  Dillinger was indeed one of the very first celebrity criminals, much like Belle Star and Jesse James.  He was not present when Homer van Meter et all escaped from Michigan State Prison and was not the leader of the gang by any means.  He was one of the youngest and least experiences of the group.  Hoover tried to name him as the leader in an attempt to sow dissension among the gang members, which didn't work at all.

And Shouse was one of the informers that made it possible to almost catch Dillinger several times.  The location of Little Bohemia as a hide out was smuggled out in a pack of cigarets, it was freezing cold with snow on the ground which made it possible for Dillinger and Nelson to leap out of the back 2nd floor.  They stayed there for several days, playing cards and relaxing.
Nelson was in the back during the bank robbery where he is depicted as leaping on a table and shooting crazily.

Tuscon was where the gang was apprehended without a single blow or a shot fired. The movie makes it seem like it could have been FL or NM.  The FBI could not be after Dillinger UNTIL he crossed state lines with Sheriff Lillian Holley's car, so while they would have liked to chase him, their hands were tied. Mackey paid firemen to rescue a duffel with their guns and their curiosity was aroused about the weight.  After seeing a crime magazine, they identified the gang members.

So, if you've bothered to read this far, go look for the many well-written books about the Depression Era Jeggs (Band Robbers) like Harvey Bailey, von Lamm, Alvin Karpis, etc.  and quit wasting your time watching this poor excuse of a film.  I would rate it lower than 0 if I could.

Mr. Depp. If you want to try again, find some people who have the ethics to follow history. The real story is so much more compelling and all of the history was there, compiled and annotated by historians.

If, on the other hand, you don't give a [expletive] about the authenticity, enjoy. Maybe they'll come out with a Marvel Comic Book version for you.",1325808000,2,3507,4.458528951486698

3967209,3,B002QEHPQA,"Careful juxtaposition of the film's rustic, natural settings with the more sparse and somber depression-sunken cities shows that Mann has designed a masterwork of authenticity; everything about the film feels impeccably antiquated.

That said, Depp's performance is nearly conflicted as it's iconic character, with the actor clearly struggling with accurate portrayals.  Consequently, Dillinger comes off as unrealistically smug and pseudo-hip more often than not, as opposed to earthy and calculated.  It's a difficult image juggle with, and I got the impression that both of the John's were equally torn, albeit for entirely different reasons.

Bale and Cotillard's efforts are much more solid and decisive, but it's Crudup who walks away with the strongest supporting performance.  Down to his accent and the pompous air he exudes with every step in his stuffy little suit, he makes Hoover easy to dislike.

Essentially laden with polish but devoid of passion, ""Public enemies"" is a very cold dish of exquisite film making.  And for that, it both excels and struggles.",1324166400,2,1071,5.4156626506024095

3967211,2,B002QEHPQA,"I put this on my wish list because it seemed to be a mainstream good 'ol shoot 'em up gangster movie.  Johnny Depp.  I could take him or leave him.  Some roles I love him in.  Others, not so much.  I really don't think he's a good actor, but there were other factors that drew me to the movie, and sometimes he hits a role dead on.

I ended up getting the movie, and before putting it in and watching it, I read the back cover.  I had no idea that Christian Bale was in it - a fine actor - or that it was directed by Michael Mann - my favorite director.  Needless to say, I was excited to finally own and watch it.

It lost me after the first half hour with its platitudes and inaccuracies.

I'm no professional scholar on John Dillinger, but I have read a little about him, and the gangster era in general.  For those reading, if you are an American history buff, you absolutely need to read ""The Dillinger Days"".  It's about 20 years old now, but I'm sure you can find it here on Amazon.  It focuses on the 18 months that the midwest was rampaged by high-profile gangsters such as Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly, Bonnie and Clyde, the Barker Gang, and the College Kidnappers.  It covers all these topics, and details the long-ignored third side to The Depression - the gangsters, besides Capone (the first two sides being The Depression itself, and Prohibition).

This is an important period in US history as it details how the FBI and ATF came to be, pulling us further into a Union, rather than independent states - for better or worse.

So, I guess my standards started off rather high with this movie.  It failed to deliver.

First, technical stuff.  The sound and visuals were good.  But, the transitions between scenes left me scratching my head.  ""Where are we right now?"", and ""How did that person get there?"", and ""Who exactly is that person, and why do I care about them?"" were three common questions that I kept asking myself during the movie.

Also, the movie moved at a quick pace - too quick.  If they simply slowed it down, and devoted more to the progression, it would have made a huge difference.

Second, the accuracy.  As I said above, I have read a little about this era.  While I read the various material, I put myself in the roles of the various characters involved - I have considered their motivations, and what daily life would be like for these people.  When I saw it played out on the big screen, it just seemed, uh, well, very implausible.

But, again with the accuracy, there are things that happened in this movie that are in direct contradiction to what I have read.  This just made it overall silly.",1315094400,2,2650,4.40618556701031

It didn't convey ""you are there,"" it conveyed ""you are nauseous."" Also, Johnny Depp and Christian Bale might as well have been mannequins.

As a review of the movie, it's definately a very interesting, expressionistic take on the John Dillinger case. Not often do you see this type of directing and the type of feel that this movie emits in an organized crime movie. There is some gore, but it's almost cheesy gore (if you're involved in a criminal justic class, you'll almost want to laugh at the gore due to the expressionistic feel the director chose and how inaccurate it seems...)

The primary downfall of this movie was the directing.  There is not one interesting shot in the movie.  I kept falling asleep because each time the film cuts to a different angle it is the same medium shot as all of the rest.  There are no real close ups, or far ways... just standard medium shots through out.

The acting overall is sub par.  It seems like this movie was made over the course of a few weeks.  There is even a scene which has a modern day jeep in the background.  No one really seemed to put any effort into this movie.

But the depth of the moral and spiritual conflicts in ""Perdition"" and the challenge to authority in ""B&C"" put them both in a higher league than this picture.  Mann is exploring the moral allegiances of his main characters and links them to their social class background.  Dillinger, as played by Johnny Depp, is brashly ambitious, climbing up out of a low class, abusive family and taking a fast break for the high life.  Christian Bale's Melvin Purvis is an idealistic Southern aristocrat, tortured by the measures J.Edgar Hoover (the always remarkable Billy Crudup) forces him to take to fight the crime wave sweeping the nation.

First off, Amazon sent me used copy.  My blu-ray didn't come with the paper sleeve over the case and nor did the edges of the case have the usual stickers/seals on them.  Instead I got a re-shrinkwrapped disc even though I paid for a new one.  Sure, this pissed me off but whatever, I couldn't return it after opening it.  Luckily, the disc itself was spotless.

Now for the movie itself, the video at times is extremely grainy.  About 20% of the scenes are just atrocious.  I'm no elitist audiophile, just a usual movie fan, but even I know when I'm looking at garbage.  The scene when Dillinger first meets Billie in the restaurant was so bad I had to recheck my PS3, Onkyo, and HDTV to make sure something wasn't broken.  I could not believe that a modern day film could get such a horrible transfer to blu-ray!  And that's just one example, there are many more and it simply ruined the movie for me.  Especially when some scenes appeared pristine, I kept wishing the whole movie could look this good, but instead, the good scenes simply exaggerated the bad scenes even more!

As for the audio, man, the blu-ray transfer was done by deaf monkeys.  Others have already harped on this before, so suffice it to say, be sure to turn on the subtitles or keep your fingers on the volume button for your receiver if you want to hear all the dialog.

If a better quality transfer of this great film ever makes its way to blu-ray again, I would repurchase it.  But steer clear of this disc for now, it is hands-down the worst looking blu-ray in my library to date.  And I'm still pissed at Amazon for sending me used crap.",1290902400,2,1892,4.400576368876081

3967224,5,B002QEHPQA,"""Public Enemies"" is a great film about the bank robber John Dillinger. Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger and he is excellent. I haven't seen a performance by Depp like this since he was in Donnie Brasco.

Watching this movie I got to see what made John Dillinger so infamous. The movie starts out with John Dillinger being led into a prison with extremely heavy security and despite this he escapes easily. The movie has one scene where John Dillinger goes to a night club and socializes with other people like he has nothing to worry about despite the fact that he's one of America's most wanted criminals. John Dillinger may have had guts, but what he did was still very wrong.

Besides Johnny Depp, the movie has other actors like Christian Bale who plays Melvin Purvis (the law enforcer who's trying to capture John Dillinger), Marion Cotillard who plays Dillinger's love interest, and Billy Crudup who is unrecognizable as the number one G-Man J. Edgar Hoover.

Here we go again with another John Dillinger movie. There have been a fair number of them over the years and the question arises, do we really need another one? The answer is, not really! But if one is insistent on making another movie about the legendary Depression-era bank robber, as Michael Mann has done here, one should at least provide us with a convincing protagonist as well as a realistic atmosphere.

One of Director Mann's big mistakes was to film 'Public Enemies"" in high definition. It's ironic that the original concept was to shoot the film as a TV mini-series based on Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book about early 30s gangsters and the origins of the FBI. The HD cinematography gives the film too modern a look as though we're watching an HBO special. What's more, some of the action is hard to make out during the scenes shot during the night. I also found the soundtrack to be irritating as the music was also much too modern at times. The fault lies with composer Elliot Goldenthal who admitted that his job was ""chiefly composing dramatic music that didn't necessarily have to sound like it came from 1931 or 1933. It could be timeless.""

But Mann's biggest mistake was to cast Johnny Depp as Dillinger. Depp might be good playing offbeat characters such as Captain Jack Sparrow or Ichabod Crane but he's no gangster. Just look at his smooth, almost feminine face--it's a face of an artistic type not of a criminal or someone who has experience dealing with the underworld. Before he became successful as an actor, Depp was involved in the rock music world as a musician and songwriter.

No doubt Depp was drawn to the films' scenarists conception of Dillinger as a misunderstood romantic. Their Dillinger makes it a point to cover a female hostage with a coat following a bank robbery. He's also adamant about not committing any kidnappings as bank robberies are his modus operandi. The only time we see the Depp Dillinger get really violent is when he slugs a man who's acting impolite toward his love interest, coat-check girl Billie Frechette. Depp Dillinger's chivalry reaches its apotheosis when he makes tender love to Billie in an early drawn-out sex scene. Now the real Dillinger was known to be quite personable and perhaps at times could be chivalrous--but what's missing here from Mr. Depp is the notion that Dillinger was a dangerous psychopath and capable of many fits of violence.

There is a complete disconnect in this film with Dillinger's character (who we're supposed to sympathize with) and his actions. Somehow Dillinger is excused for his behavior because deep down he's simply misunderstood--he's not really violent. In his place is a surrogate--Baby Face Nelson (very convincingly played by Stephen Graham) who we can blame for the violence while the Depp Dillinger gets his free pass. Even lawman Purvis' associates end up being worse than Dillinger--they torture one of the gang members to extract information and rough up Billie before Purvis intercedes on her behalf.

Another big mistake in this script is that it totally lacks humor. Compare the humorless Depp Dillinger with the wise-cracking psychopath conceived by Warren Oates in John Millius' 1973 take on the notorious outlaw. In the 1973 ""Dillinger"", Oates is far more believable because he can be both funny (likeable) and scary. Sometimes the violence is too over the top when he slugs Billie (played by Michelle Phillips) in the face but there are enough moments of black humor that give the 1973 film its charm. Despite being too old for the part, Ben Johnson was a far superior Melvin Purvis in the '73 version to Christian Bale's virtual automaton. Johnson's phone conversation with Oates is hilarious as he makes it clear that their relationship is 'nothing personal' and everything is kept on a 'friendly' level. On the other hand, Bale, with no coolness whatsoever, simply informs Depp while he's in the jail cell that the only time he'll get out is once he's executed!

Just as in the 1973 version, all the main bases are touched in the Dillinger story: Dillinger's arrest and escape from the Crown Point, Indiana jail; the shootout at the Little Bohemia Lodge and Dillinger's death in front of the Biograph theater. What the new film has over its predecessor is some nice on-location cinematography. However, the opening scene gives more credit to Dillinger than is his due: he never directly participated in the escape of his associates at the Indiana State Prison.

My main problem with 'Public Enemies' was that it deliberately attempted to distort and perhaps glorify a criminal who terrorized innocent people. Even if Dillinger never killed anyone (although he supposedly was responsible for the death of at least one bank guard), good citizens feared for their lives whenever he robbed a bank or took people hostage. What's more, 'Public Enemies' only presents the basic outline of the Dillinger story. We never get a sense of a fleshed-out human being, replete with all the behind-the scene tidbits that could have made this film something truly special. It's hard to believe that Michael Mann is the same director who gave us the excellent 'Last of the Mohicans'. But the aging process will take its toll on even some of the most creative among us.",1289174400,2,5319,4.9153674832962135

3967229,3,B002QEHPQA,"Its rare that I actually think a movie should be longer, but Public Enemies (2009) is one of those films.  As Michael Mann's latest contribution to the crime drama genre, starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, the movie looks and sounds spectacular!  No shock coming from one of my favorite film directors of all time.  Mann is a genius at packaging visual imagery, storytelling, music and sound in all of his movies.  But Public Enemies feels a little short and abbreviated in its story and character development.  Granted, many filmgoers probably know some or all of the story of Depression Era bank robber John Dillinger.  But as I watched the movie, I kept wanting to know more about these guys and their stories.  That's why I watch the movies...to escape into the story and relationships of the characters.

Maybe its just that I'm too young to know much about this story and Mann chose to exclude the ""obvious""...or maybe the wham-bam-thank-you-Ma'am film viewing audiences of today have finally gotten to Michael Mann like with so many filmmakers and Hollywood movie studios.  It seems to me that so many of the action-thriller-drama movies of today are mostly just about finding a fast way to connect one amazing action sequence after another.  Throw in a little sex or love story with a hot chic...add some frustrated gazes by the leading man while smoking a cigarette...and any other cool visuals that can transition you to the next best shoot-em-up-and-car-chase scene.  Now I'm not saying that Public Enemies is at that extreme because it is definately a much better crafted movie than that.  But compared to Mann's best movies (Heat, The Insider, and The Last of the Mohicans), I just feel a little let down with Public Enemies because Mann has set the bar so high with me for his movies.  He's managed to go an entire decade since I last really fell in love with one of his movies (The Insider from 1999).

That being said...I still think Public Enemies is one of the better movies of 2009.  Its more than worth viewing simply for the incredible cinematography and soundtrack.  And the story is good...just not enough.  I have a feeling that I will appreciate this movie more upon subsequent viewings...as is the case with all of Michael Mann's films.  As an obsessive detail-oriented filmmaker, Mann's movies are just so packed with ""stuff"" that it takes time to process it all.  And maybe there is more subtext and story in this movie than I think upon first viewing.  And watching about an hour of `Making-Of' features on the bluray disc after seeing the movie got me more excited about the movie...because there was a lot more of the Dillinger story in those behind-the-scenes features.

So check this flick out in your home movie theater soon.  And if you haven't seen Michael Mann's three 90s films...get them immediately for your viewing pleasure!",1286323200,,2871,4.840163934426229

The problem is that both Dillinger and Purvis are men of action, not words.  Their speech is laconic and, in some cases little more than a series of grunts.  I could have used subtitles for many of the scenes.  The plot is straightforward.  Dillinger robs banks; Purvis tries to catch him; Frank Nitti looks on; Dillinger robs more banks; everybody shoots machine guns; Purvis tries to catch him . . .  The film does not have any noticeable themes and it does not engage us with any significant issues.  The characters are largely two-dimensional; the love scenes involving Depp and Cotillard are predictable and unexceptional.  The principal actors are not given the opportunity to show their chops and Stephen Lang is largely wasted.  Crudup plays the wooden Hoover in a wooden way.  Ribisi is a notable exception.  His portrayal of Alvin Karpis is one of the best elements in the film.  Watch for Diana Krall playing a torch singer.

From Goodfellas to even the over the top Dick Tracy, the whole fast paces tommy gun bonanza is something that just gets me going. When I saw that Johnny Depp was going to play one of the most notorious gangsters of the 1930's, along with a stellar cast I thougt 'Public Enemies' was going to be one of the greatest. An anticipation for seeing in theaters went from DVD anticipation to just seeing it on HBO on demand.

I really don't plan on going into too many details, but this movie made 'Twilight' look oscar worthy. The movie was way too slow and just plain jumbled. Sometimes I had no idea what was going on. The acting was bland and that is what made me so upset because you have Christian Bale, Billy Crudup, Marion Colliard and tons of famous names...I couldn't even finish watching the movie. After about an hour in i turned off in disgust.

For a movie of this calibur I would wonder what went wrong in making this movie.

3967241,3,B002QEHPQA,"I had heard of John Dillinger vaguely before renting this movie, and mainly, the only reason I gave it a shot was because of Johnny Depp, who acts in the main role as the infamous criminal. I consider him to be one of the most brilliant actors of our generation, and I usually love his movies. But I wasn't struck with an enjoyment when watching ""Public Enemies"". I was actually disappointed.

The biggest reason I didn't enjoy this movie was because of the way it was filmed. Most movies have a much crisper quality about them, but the film used to portray John's story is grainy and strange to watch. It's almost like watching someone film a movie with a video recorder from Best Buy; some people might like this unique approach to filming, but I think it takes away from the power of a movie.

Coming in a close second is the fact that this movie is remarkably plot-less. The story is a little confusing, and the flat story-line, as well as dialog that didn't spring life into the tale, was disappointing. For most of the film, I sat, bored, and usually skipped to better scenes. There is little action, and the climax is hardly engaging.

However, with my negative opinions aside, there are a few things that make this movie decent, and worth a watch. Johnny Depp is still an excellent actor, portraying the life of the dead criminal as well as he could. Christian Bale also makes a strong opponent to Johnny's character; though it's hard to see anyone but Batman when I see Christian, it was enjoyable to  watch him. Finally, the love between Johnny's character, Dillinger, and the girl he finds, Billie, is very touching. Based on a real criminal and a real relationship, they create a very tortured, but honest connection, and that alone made this movie a bit better.

So if you're reading this, and trying to decide if you should bother watching ""Public Enemies"", I insist you watch it just to get your own opinion. It's not an Oscar-worthy movie, but still somehow... strong, and worth a rent.",1279324800,4,2002,4.612359550561798
3967242,5,B002QEHPQA,"When this movie came on TV tonight, I was pleasantly surprised.

With a nation-wide man-hunt on for Public Enemy No. One, notorious bank robber John Dillinger, this drama takes the viewer along for the bloody, horrific ride. Throughout the tense action of brutal bank robberies, street warfare with Tommy-guns blazing in all directions, harrowing prison breakouts and life-and-death chases through eerie woods, I felt like I was ""inside"" the action.

There isn't much humor in this movie, but what little there is comes from Dillinger himself who is endearingly cocky and overly confident. When he first meets and falls for beautiful coat-check girl Billie Frechette and she asks what he does, he says, ""I'm John Dillinger and I rob banks."" In that context, I couldn't help but laugh.

Another show of wit was when he sang ""I'm headed for the last roundup,"" which struck me as humorous in an ironic way... Dark humor...or was it prophetic?

Johnny Depp is brilliant in this role; he not only plays the part of Dillinger, he is the man! He's a smart, methodical man who outwits the FBI at every turn...except the last one, of course. His, posture, facial expressions and entire performance are ""dead on"" to how I think Dillinger would be. Although I abhor his crimes, I feel some sympathy for the hunted, haunted man.

I found it odd that many citizens of that Depression era actually made a ""hero"" of him, which made for some rather ""touching"" scenes. One thing can be said for Dillinger, he was loyal to his gang and to his ""love,"" Billie Frechette, sympathetically portrayed by actress Marion Cotillard. Christian Bale was also excellent with his tight-lipped portrayal of FBI Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the man credited with bringing Dillinger down. (The FBI also targeted Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson.)

I admired the agent who kept Dillinger's last, whispered words a secret from the other agents and delivered them to Billie personally. Whether this really happened or was ""movie drama"" I don't know, but I cried when Billie cried. I bet you will ""tear up"" when you hear what Dillinger said too. A sad ending, to be sure, but it ended the only way it could--with the message that must be delivered: Crime does not pay!

I agree with Kathleen C. Fennessy from Amazon's product description who says, ""...it's still the best mainstream gangster epic in ages and ranks among Mann's finest works."" Kudos to Director Michael Mann for his incredible eye for detail and superb casting. A solid five stars for this realistic, exciting movie.

Endnote: The movie is set in the golden era of bank robbers, a time when law enforcement struggled through its dark ages. Police departments were out-manned and outgunned, and J. Edgar Hoover's FBI agents were outsmarted. By the time Dillinger was killed outside a Chicago movie theater on July 22, 1934, his gang of yeggs--the era's name for bank robbers--had stolen tens of thousands of dollars from uninsured banks and shot about a dozen people, including police officers. The movie plays up Dillinger's life in Chicago, his robberies and his charisma, but it also glosses over several key robberies in my home state of Ohio. When I was a kid in Ohio, it was rumored that Dillinger hid-out in my hometown of Hamilton between robberies. A claim to fame? I think not!

3967245,3,B002QEHPQA,"I started viewing the John Dillinger dramatization with the understanding that movies about larger than life, iconic characters are nearly always heavily rife with exaggeration and a fair amount of creative license, but ""Public Enemies"" really went overboard.

Johnny Depp was perfectly cast in the role of Dillinger, in that he does over the top very well, and the role called for that kind of acting.

There was the obligatory contrived love story arc that brought ""Pearl Harbor"" to mind. I think a lot of the story of Dillinger's life was sacrificed for the benefit of an awkward, underdeveloped love interest that was only present to fit into a formulaic design to construct the movie.

A really nice part of the film was the cinematography. The mix of wide angle shots and shaky first person shooting immersed me in the action scenes.

One of the more innovative scenes used an effect of transitioning to antique video camera type quality in the presence of period news crews. Another great scene started at Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters and turned into Dillinger watching a newsreel of the headquarters seamlessly.

Any time a movie is done in a historical setting, I usually try to suspend disbelief and not really worry about historical accuracy. I understand that for a movie designed to make money, historical accuracy will always be thrown out in favor of making the movie more marketable and appealing. However there are usually blatant historical inaccuracies that can trigger me to go on a hunt to look for all the problems with the film.

For ""Public Enemies,"" this blatant disregard for fact happened when Dillinger accompanied a girlfriend to the Chicago Police headquarters while she was getting a waitressing license. I was able to suspend disbelief that America's most wanted criminal would willingly go into a police station at the center of the investigation to bring him to custody. I was also willing to believe that someone might need a waitressing license to work at a restaurant in 1930's Chicago.

What positively killed the movie for me was when Depp, as Dillinger, approached a group of detectives crowded around a radio listening to a baseball game. Dillinger casually asked the score.

""Cubs 3-2 top of the 7th,"" the detective answers just as casually. As the camera zooms in on the radio, the radio announcer reports, ""Leading off for the Yankees..."" at which point, the scene ends.

This was supposedly the day Dillinger died, July 22, 1934. Are the majority of viewers so ignorant as to believe the Cubs were playing the Yankees at Wrigley Field in July, 1934?

This is not just a little mix-up, I could understand if the people who put the scene together didn't research for two minutes to find out the Cubs lost to the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5 on July 22, 1934. The two minutes was no exaggeration, by the way, that's how long it took me to dig up that little nugget.

The primary sin here is that the movie introduces interleague play 63 years early. The Cubs and Yankees didn't play against each other once in 1934, and the only occasion they would have had to do so would have been the World Series, which doesn't take place in July.

For me, this historical inaccuracy made the rest, which I'd stomached fairly well to that point, pretty much unbearable. I think what truly bothered me about the interleague play gaffe was that it was not creative license, but sheer unbridled laziness.

For instance, the film portrayed Baby Face Nelson being gunned down at the famous shootout in Little Bohemia, in a really well done scene. The main problem with this of course is that Nelson didn't actually die until 4 months after Dillinger. At first, I assumed it was just a plot ripple designed to make Special Agent Melvin Purvis a bit more interesting as a character, but after seeing the baseball scene, I think it could just be another mistake in the film.

""Public Enemies"" was just okay as a work of pure fiction. It was enjoyable, but not thoroughly re-watchable. I give it a 5.5 out of 10.",1276300800,12,4045,4.8097982708933715

Three things that I love about movies come together in this film, gangster films, Johnny Depp, and Michael Mann. When I first heard about this film I could not have been more excited about a film, all those things together and Depp is playing John Dillinger. Really and honestly what more could you ask for, I knew this would be a good film. As I thought when this first came out I was right, it is a good film. But after watching more I realized that it could have been more. I was sure what it was missing but it felt like it could have been more.

I am sure you all know the story of John Dillinger the legendary outlaw that was officially the first public enemy number one. He was also one of the main reason the FBI was formed and was basically a hero in his time amongst the regular people. The people at the time looked at him as a person sticking it to the man during the Great Depression. Of course he loved this as is said in the movie, he hides out amongst those same people so he wants to be on their side. Dillinger was really an interesting dude who had a lot of charisma like when he speaks to the reporters after being captured, yes that really happened. Most of the stuff in here about Dillinger is spot on including locations, but other things have been changed like Baby face's death.

So of course the title alone gives away what the film is about, the criminal life of one John Dillinger. Unlike a lot of biopic films this just focuses on the last part of his life when he was really infamous. From the incredible jail breaks to the heists it is all here, including his time with Baby face Nelson. Nelson was not the typical guy Dillinger would hang out with since he really didn't care about the people and was reckless. Still the film touches on all from Purvis and Hoover to the formation of the FBI. Of course his death and the famous lady in red situation is all here.

I must say the film was brilliantly shot by Dante Spinotti and company, I loved the way it was presented. The look and feel of the film matches the time period perfectly, so here is to all those behind the camera. Director and co writer Michael Mann did a good job with this film in my opinion even though I still think it could have been more. Maybe it was the script that lacked that little something but it felt like it was just almost there, not completely a classic. Still even with that said and historical things out of place and or changed it was still an entertaining film.

Johnny Depp was absolutely perfect to play Dillinger as he showcased the man at his charismatic best. Depp has never disappointed me ever and does not in this film, loved his performance as the confident outlaw. Christian Bale also does a great job as Melvin Purvis, the man appointed to hunt Dillinger and his fellow criminals of the time down. Bale is another guy that really as never disappointed me although he strikes me as the type that can truly shine under a great director. Channing Tatum is here for a short time as famous outlaw Pretty Boy Floyd and Billy Crudup portrays J. Edgar Hoover perfectly. Stephen Graham is really fun as Baby face Nelson and really makes him come to life, and also MMA legend Don Frye is here as Clarence Hurt one of the specialist brought in to hunt Dillinger down.

This film is not entirely historically accurate but it a lot of the time, in fact the behind the scenes shows you just how much is real. I love that they shot his death scene at the actual spot, literally at the spot. The 2 disc addition includes a lot of great special features including documentaries on the real Dillinger and outlaws of the time. Also there is a great commentary on disc 1. I recommend this film because I enjoyed it and thought it was a really good film. It is not the classic it could have been but it is still a very good movie.",1270598400,3,3853,4.314917127071824

Okay...I do remember that I was somewhat entertained. I also remember leaving the room during the movie to get a snack without bothering to pause the movie; the movie was so slow-moving that I just wanted it to be over. Johnny Depp did a fair rendition of gangster/bank robber John Dillinger. Christian Bale did a horrible rendition of an FBI agent with a Southern twang (maybe I'm just spoiled by Bale's excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B000PC6A3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;portrayal).

The movie was too long; I don't how long the theatrical version was, but the On Demand Director's Cut version that I viewed was well over 2 hours. I'm a big fan of directors' cuts when they add cool stuff; however, there are times when the theatrical versions are best left as is for the DVD release. Public Enemies was probably an example of the latter.

Johnny Depp does a great job as public enemy no. 1  John Dillinger, and Christian Bale does an AMAZING job as Melvin Purvis. The most amazing thing about this movie is the fact that most of the locations this movie was filmed are the actual places John Dillinger and his gang were standing in close to 70 years ago!!!

3967257,3,B002QEHPQA,"The story was really pretty good, but the CGI blood and poor audio mix make this blu ray a pass.

Specifically, the dialog track (in full DTS-HD Master)is very unbalanced and requires the viewer to dial the audio up significantly, which causes all action sequences with gunfire to be extremely overpowering.

Additionally, for some inexplicable reason, in many scenes, blood from bullet wounds was very clearly CGI-based and looks laughably fake - to the point of distraction. I found myself being drawn out of the movie mentally to consider why Michael Mann would have let such low grade effects pass muster in this big budget movie.

For as much as I wanted to love this movie, being a long-time Mann fan, I am left feeling cheated somehow that this effort was 'phoned in' on the collective reputations of the stars and director. The source material was very good and the topic very interesting, in my opinion, so I cannot help but wonder if the script in the hands of a hungrier director couldn't have shined a lot more.",1269907200,,1023,4.735955056179775
3967258,3,B002QEHPQA,"I loved Johnny Depp's potrayal of John Dillinger, Chicago bank rober in post depression era.  No matter how ruthless the character is, he is also loyal to his friends and the woman he loves.  His charisma makes even journalists swoon over him.  What I found fascinating is actually the bonus material that explains the making of this criminal character.  As a young boy, he experiences his mother's death and lives dreadful life with an abusive father; Dillinger ends up in jail for 10 years as a young teenager boy after robbing the local convenience store.  Dillinger is likable guy in spite of his ruthlessness. His buddies love him and stick with him though think and thin.  Women adore his charm.  He dresses like a succesful businessman in latest and finest fashion and makes Chicago the base of his adventures as a bank robber.

Dillinger's love for Billie, young woman from Wisconsin of French and Native American heritage is type of a love story every woman dreams of.  He loves her and takes care of her the best possible way he can considering his line of work.  They have a lot in common.  Both come from humble social backgrounds, both loose their mothers early in their lives and have almost savage way of savoring life and all that comes with it.  They are smitten by each other and this type of volatile attraction is what makes their relationship unique.

By the end of this film, I was really surprised at how conventional and tired Mann's sensibility was.  Another movie romanticizing (albeit in grave, heavy-handed style) the lives of Dillinger and co.?  It's like he took one of those 30s gangster flicks, gussied it up with moody atmosphere, packed it with an all-star cast, and yet drained it of energy and flair and excitement--to accomplish what?  There's no new perspective on these lives, no kind of modern, edgier take on Dillinger, or any kind of freshness in the execution. It's the same romanticized vision of these anti-heroes we've seen time and again (and Mann's already done before). The whole movie feels stale and plodding for its 2 1/2 hour duration.  I also dislike Mann's recent use of digital video to shoot his films--this one has a dull, flat look that just adds to the lugubrious feel.  Mann still knows how to stage the action scenes, and he gets good performances out of his actors, but the pop sensibility, the fun slickness of style, and the excitement of Mann's earlier work has disappeared without any compensatory maturing of themes or film-making craft.

3967264,3,B002QEHPQA,"Mann tells the story of John Dillinger (Depp) the last great American outlaw and the man who brought him down, FBI Agent Purvis (Bale). During The Great Depression, Dillinger was considered a folkhero. He stole from the banks but never the patrons. Old film footage even shows him treated like a rockstar upon his capture. Shockingly, Mann stays true to some historical facts, but he does take plenty of liberties to enhance the story. Using groundbreaking investigation techniques for that time, Purvis succeeds in capturing Dillinger. However, some good lawyering and a wood gun leads up to an extraordinary breakout. Agent Purvis is now even more determined to not only recapture the bank robber but to make sure he can never escape again!

The movie is wonderfully acted by it's two leads, Bale and Depp. Mann loves to pit great actors against each other and it's nice to watch. Ultimately the story is not that compelling. It lacks the charm of other gangster flicks like ""The Untouchables"" and ""Mobsters"". Even though the movie runs 2 hours and 21 minutes there is substance missing. The movie desreves 3.5 stars not 3, but the option isn't available. A very good movie that could have been better.

MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: This is the first Universal Blu ray that I was disappointed in. The picture is nice but not amazing. There are even some scenes where color seems a little off. Maybe this was a lighting decision to make it look like more of a period piece, who knows? The sound is either too loud or hard to hear. The special features are very interesting, especially the historical ones. FINAL VERDICT: A MUST OWN FOR GANGSTER MOVIE FANS! Still worth a watch.",1267228800,3,1670,4.775086505190312
3967265,3,B002QEHPQA,"Michael Mann's latest is at least as frustrating as it is satisfying.  The story of John Dillinger is told, from the time he was sent back to prison for the second time, through to his ultimate demise.  The movie presents a thief versus dogged pursuing cop in a superficially similar way to Heat, as a mesmerizingly charismatic Johnny Depp as Dillinger, and a glowering Christian Bale as Melvyn Purvis the FBI agent face off against each other.  However, the tale unfolds in a much more traditional and workmanlike fashion than you might expect from Mann's previous work.  The period setting is terrifically presented, as is the rat-a-tat of period armoury.  The script however, tells the story in an orderly fashion, not really delving much into the characters or their motivations.  The only detour into understanding a little about what was going on in Dillinger's head is a detour into the romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette, which seems neither long enough to do justice to a terrific turn from Marion Cotillard, or brief enough to avoid feeling like it's been uncomfortably shoehorned in.  Christian Bale plays a straight role also, without really ever feeling we understand what drives the man.
It's entertaining, and has enough prison breakouts, chases and bank robberies to keep you glued for the slightly lengthy running time.  However, there are some unusual stylistic choices which do not quite work.  Mann has filmed in Hi-Def Digital cameras, eschewing film for the first time.  Period movies shot in film have a warmth and softness to the pallet that `feels right' to the eye.  Digital cameras have a way of making the action real and immediate, certainly, but so real and immediate it begins to feel like reality TV documentary style.  Bright lights burn into the screen, and fast movement feels harsh on the eye in a way that we are used to seeing on the TV screen rather than in a period movie setting.  There are times it works to make the viewer accept what you are seeing as real, and not a construct.  But there are more times when the digital camera artefacts break the fourth wall and you are reminded this IS a movie set and not real, particularly with the directors penchant for hand held camera for even the most static of dialogue scenes.  As a stylistic experiment it is a bold choice - but ultimately one that does not help the movie.  On the plus side, the transfer to Bluray is certainly striking, and you are certainly left feeling you saw the movie as the director intended.
So - entertaining, yes.  Interesting document of exploits of one of America's most notorious criminals and the birth of the FBI - yes.  However, as a piece of cinema it is flawed, and not likely to stick in your mind for the right reasons.",1267228800,,2760,4.750524109014675

It is a shame that such great actors like Johnny Depp and Christian Bale and a great director like Michael Mann couldn't have come up with a story that is less focused on celebrity and more focused on the background and why they became so famous or infamous.

Rated: R
Genre: Action / Drama
Release Date: 01 July 2009

""I'm John Dillinger... I rob banks."" He just says it. When it comes to being cool, nobody is cooler than Johnny Depp. He fits the role of real-life notorious bank robber John Dillinger, like a glove in Public Enemies.

I guess I have an itching desire for gangster movies; in 2006, my favorite film of the year was The Departed and in 2007 it was American Gangster. You want my pick for the best movie of 2009? Here it is folks.
It's absolutely baffling that Public Enemies was overlooked entirely for the Oscars. I thought for sure it would have been nominated in categories for best picture, directing, best actor in a leading role (Johnny Depp), best adapted screenplay, costume design, cinematography, sound, and original score. Man, was I wrong.

Director Michael Mann brings us another masterpiece filled with some of the best detailed action sequences imaginable. He is an expert at filling good action movies with a plausible plot and colorful characters. The Last of the Mohicans, Miami Vice, Heat and Collateral are all examples of his artistic ability to do so.

We learn a lot about John Dillinger in the very beginning of the film. He doesn't like the police, he doesn't like rules and he doesn't like idiots within his own crew. This is all shown in an exciting prison break sequence. Dillinger and others break into a prison to bust some of their pals out. While doing so, one of them is killed, thanks to the negligence of one of the guys within the crew. In response to this, Dillinger beats the man about the face and then throws him from a moving vehicle.

While he sounds cruel, you should know that he does at least have a soft spot for his gal. Much like the way Denzel's character Frank Lucas met his girl in American Gangster; Dillinger meets his at a nightclub, and simply has to have her. His classic one-liners he uses to woo her will be jotted down by guys, to use later and will make girls even more week in the knees for Johnny Depp.

Dillinger's girl is Billie Frechette, played wonderfully by Marion Cotillard. Her scenes with Dillinger are not the film's main focus, but you get everything you need from them to keep you engulfed in the story and its characters. Their love is pure, unconditional and they want nothing more than to be together; which makes it all the more exciting for us as audience members, knowing they are being hunted down by the police.

Billy Crudup (the blue naked guy from Watchmen) is a seriously underrated actor and is going to make it big; just wait. He plays FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. When Hoover is virtually being eaten alive by the press and the courts, due to Dillinger's reign of madness, he calls on an agent whose reputation precedes him: Melvin Purvis.

Christian Bale has the role of Purvis, and plays him not quite as good as he played Batman, but significantly better than he did John Connor. He makes for a nice screen-match with Johnny Depp.

Having just taken down another notorious bank robber by the name of Pretty Boy Floyd, Purvis is the perfect man for the job. He soon learns however, that Dillinger may be a little more than he can handle on his own. So he calls in some experts to assist him. One of which was played superbly by a guy up and coming in Hollywood, whom I have my eye on: Stephen Lang.

We have an extensive game of cat and mouse that keeps us on the edge of our seats. Before Dillinger can walk away form the bank robbing scene and live happily ever after with his gal, he must do what every other `Hollywood gangster' does: take on one final score that will set him up for life.

Public Enemies is hands down one of the best gangster pictures of all time. From the detailed costumes, to the old-school cinematography style, the movie takes us back to the 1930s; and we enjoy the trip.",1266624000,,4281,4.614473684210527

While the principles did a good kob depicting their characters, the film was short on the action one would expect considering the subject.  It dealt more with the psychology of the opponents, John Dillinger and Melvin Pervis, than with the reasons Dillinger became the folk hero (or anti-hero) he was.  The period  was a time when the gangsters, especially the bank robbers, were making headlines every day.

3967276,5,B002QEHPQA,"The movie is very well done, a fairly accurate portrayal of the last years  in the life of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger. Melvin Purvis, an FBI agent who was key in gunning Dillinger down, was given control of the newly formed Chicago field office in the FBI's early days under the directon of J. Edgar Hoover. In 1933, during the fourth year of the Great depression, Dillinger, the now famous bank robber, is considered Public Enemy #1. Yet, he becomes somewhat of a folk hero as he tends to attack big businesses while leaving ordinary citizens alone; the ""Robin Hood Syndrome"". Eventually, Dillinger falls in love with Billie Frechette and the FBI stakes her out while trying to catch the outlaw.

Public Enemies is indeed one of Michael Mann's finest works and also showcases some of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale's most stellar performances.  But how Mann, a leading advocate of HD digital filmmaking still managed to deliver an epic so video-like in quality is beyond me.

The entire movie, even on DVD, still has a strangely electronic video feel.  I avoided this in the theatres, precisely because the film trailers looked so oddly like a video blow up.  The colours are retained much better in the small screen, but the film's action and night sequences are tell tale giveaways that the picture we're seeing is a product of an electronic camera chip, and not the traditional 35 mm film camera.

Still, Public Enemies is a highly enjoyable film for all its technical flaws.  I think Mann's love of electronic filmmaking needs better tools - I have not been impressed by his forays into the medium.  Previous films like Collateral worked better in terms of using the video format, but his love of shooting dark scenes just don't cut it.  Gone are the rich velvet blacks of film, replaced by these strange murky areas.  If you watched the film and didn't notice its electronic quirks - great.  My comments shouldn't stop anyone from watching the show, but as someone from the industry, it irked me a little.

On a more significant note, Depp really shines as Dillinger and delivers the robin hood charisma; while Bale is well casted as his relentless and intense nemesis.  Marion Cotillard also turns in an impressive performance as Dillinger's moll (she's French!).

Mann captures the romantic era of James Cagney well - Public Enemies never lets up on its entertainment value, and it looks like everyone had a lot of fun working on this one.",1265500800,,1812,4.837662337662338

3967281,4,B002QEHPQA,"As a Chicagoan I have seen movies at the Biograph Theatre, and know quite a bit about Chicago history.  The main reason I was interested in this movie was because a friend of my daughter-in-law actually was hired as an extra during the filming.  I spotted her in the movie, and I love it when the film actually uses local landmarks for a movie as this one did.  I'm not exactly sure how true to life the story is, but it certainly was believable.  The acting was very good.  The only thing I would caution viewers about is that there is quite a bit of bloody violence which may turn some people off.  Just close your eyes.  The rest of the movie is excellent.  I saw the movie originally in a theatre, but wanted to DVD to see it again.  Plus the DVD has extra features which you don't get in the theatre.",1265414400,,805,4.209150326797386
3967282,4,B002QEHPQA,"First off, I have to say I enjoyed the movie from an entertainment point-of-view.  I'm never disappointed when it comes to Johnny Depp. A true chameleon for the craft of acting.  The problem I did have with the movie was the accuracy in the dates of when the main bank robbers were killed.  Pretty Boy Floyd was killed October 22, 1934.  Baby Face Nelson was killed November 27, 1934.  John Dillenger was killed July 22, 1934.  In the movie, Floyd and Nelson were killed before Dillinger. And to the big selling point itself;  The woman (Ana Cumpanas)that helped with the capture/murder of John Dillinger.  She was suppose to be the ""Woman in Red"", right?  Why was she in white and orange? Being that I'm somewhat of a history buff, things such as this add realism to the movie if accurate.  Otherwise, it's just another fictional movie just for one's entertainment.  But hey, the movie's out and the cat'so ut of the bag,  Can't go back and change it now.",1265414400,,956,4.591715976331361

3967284,3,B002QEHPQA,"I'm a fan of Mann, gangster movies, and Depp, so it's no surprise that I liked this movie.  It's a bit slow-building and deliberate in its pacing, but I would consider that a positive in this age of the ADD Hollywood blockbuster.  Acting is solid, cinematography is good and sometimes great, and the film's designers do a good job of capturing the feel of 1930s Chicago.  The story unfolds nicely and builds to a satisfying conclusion.  There is quite a bit of action, but it suits the story and the film does not devolve into a ""shoot 'em up"" movie.  I have heard that it is not historically accurate, but I viewed this for entertainment rather than a history lesson, so no deduction for that.

What does warrant a deduction, however is the very poor sound quality on the Blu-ray.  (I have not viewed the standard DVD, so I have no comment on that.)  I have a decent 5.1 home theater set-up (Denon receiver, Infinity speakers) and I have watched dozens of Blu-rays, and I am almost always blown away with the stellar audio.  Not with this one.  During the opening sequence when Dillinger and company are fleeing the prison by car, the dialogue is so quiet as to be nearly inaudible.  Throughout the movie, dialogue seems to vary in loudness, forcing me to adjust the volume every few minutes.  The mix is off too, as the gun-fire sequences (of which there are quite a few) are super loud while everything else is overly muted.  I have read other reviews where people say that it sounds like the movie was mixed by a 12 year old, and I can't really disagree with that.

Based upon his past work, Mann seems to be a solid film-maker so I don't understand how this happened.  And it's not just the Blu-ray; I saw this in the theaters and I remember noticing similar audio issues then as well.  Too bad, because the poor audio really takes away from an otherwise solid movie.",1265328000,,1872,4.494082840236686
3967285,4,B002QEHPQA,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a huge fan of Michael Mann, Johnny Depp, the 1930's, and the source material for this movie (a book by the same name by Brian Burroughs).  Public Enemies focuses almost exclusively on John Dillinger, played magnificently by Depp, his exploits, and his relationship with Billy Frechette.  The movie does take some liberties with history for dramatic effect.  Some characters are omitted and events are jumbled.  It's not that noticeable except in the case of Christian Bale's character, Melvin Purvis, who was a tard.  He's very heroic in this film and I understand that a strong foil for Depp is needed.  He doesn't disappoint.

The acting is very strong in this film.  I have no complaints.  Also, the picture and sound are exceptional.  The film looks like it was filmed digitally and Mann always has a great eye for action.  I feel, though, that the film suffers from being a little overly long with its character beats.  There is a lot of character development here, and it is not balanced with enough drama, action, or excitement.  It should have been a little less talky or have a little more action.

All in all, I loved this movie as much as i loved the book.  If I could have one thing changed, maybe there should be more focus on the lesser-known criminals, particularly Giovanni Ribisi's Alvin Karpis.  That would have been really cool because he was so great in the few scenes that he had.

I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.  It is not perfect, but few films are truth be told.  I feel that this is an excellent addition to anyone's film library.",1265155200,,1610,4.665480427046264

I expected a lot more from Michael Mann. He is one of my favorite directors. He has done so many good to great films from Collateral, Manhunter, The Last of the Mohicans to Heat.

The script/writing for this film was terrible. The way writers put the film together was all wrong.

The pace of the film will put you to sleep. The was no drama, because you just won't care about anyone in this film. The action was pathetically done with grainy film to I guess make it feel more realistic.

The music...well there virtually was none and when there was some it wasn't very good.

The acting had to be my biggest disappointment. Everyone seemed like robots no emotion, almost like they were sleep walking through the film. Christian Bale trying to destroy his reputation as a good actor this year. First Terminator and now this film. Then there was Johnny Depp who I think is a great actor, he was the only thing truly worth while in the Pirate of the Caribbean movies. But in this movie he just looked bored uninterested.

Then there was the running time of the film at about 2 1/2 hours long seemed like a eternity. I kept hoping the film would just end. And I know some of you will fall asleep watching this movie. I know I saw people asleep in the showing I went to and many were laughing at how bad it was.

Overall this has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a theater in a long time. If you want to learn about John Dillinger watch the History Channel show about him and the other guys from that time or read a book I guarantee you'll be more entertained that way.

I just can't believe I couldn't find anything redeeming about this film but I couldn't. I think the last film I saw like that was Battlefield Earth and that's saying something about this film.",1264636800,27,1832,4.33625730994152

3967297,5,B002QEHPQA,"This movie is well made. Of course there are historical errors galore but thats the way it is in bio-pic land. Every bio pic is inaccurate by nature. You typically grab three of the best selling authors on a topic and then craft a screenplay around it which is always going to be different.

The book is amazing -- Pubilc Enemies -- is a well crafted book with some horrifying attributes to it. This portrays the United States in one of its worst periods, (yes, there have been many) where people gear up to a state of Anarchy and give birth to the FBI. Dillenger comes off as being somewhat misunderstood in this narrative. You almost feel sorry for him in some scenes, (he was incarcerted for 10 years for holding up a mom and pop grocery store of all things).

The book really is worth reading because you get some incredible insight on how powerful and destructive Dillenger really was. My favorite part was when he wanted to blow off a corner of prison with some dynamite -- this would have killed everyone involved but thats the kind of mind he had. Explosive.

Some of that comes off in this film. The first 10 minutes is worth the price of this movie alone because it is outrageous.

You really cannot stack this up with Arthur Penn or Scorseses work because its not that kind of a film. Its very thought provoking and insightful. It is violent but there is some heart to this portrayal. It definately gives us a much different portrayal of Chicago thats for sure. I tend to think this was more or less the way it was. Earlier films of Dillenger portray Chicago much differently.
You will notice that the city of Chicago looks pretty much like the way it looks now. Its an old city.

John Millius had more of a folksy approach to it when he did his 1973(?) classic homage to Dillenger. i don't think it was really that way at all. Chicago is an old city, the buildings are classic, and Dillenger and Homer Van Meter and all the rest -- Capone too.. travelled through their halls... this film has an amazing backdrop. Chicago is fascinating to begin with.

These characters really bring that town to life - its pure essence.. spend some time in that city and you will know what I am talking about.

I used to live there .....

Interestingly enough.. I went to the Biograph theater where Dillenger was killed. The alleyway is all bricked up now but there was a door there that he walked out of. I saw a Johnny Depp movie there, ""Donnie BRasco"" some years back.... I don't remember much of the inside of that theater as its very old.... I wanted to walk out the back door but it was barricaded off. I walked up and down to alley to see what it must have been like.

What a lot of people don't realize is that DIllenger actually lived right in Chicago where he committed his crimes. He sometimes stayed right there in Lincoln Park, and near Wrigley Field.

Its hot as hell too in Chicago in the summer time. Its a very brutal place to live. This film taps into some of that. And this was shot digitally too with no film and that is worth mentioning. They got a lot of soft tones with this film and it mimicks film stock. I think they did an amazing job with this movie.

3967300,3,B002QEHPQA,"In ""Public Enemies"" Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger, one of the most notorious Depression-era outlaws. The 140 minute movie directed by Michael Mann covers most of the major events that happened in his life - his escape from the Indiana State Prison to the ""Woman in Red"" episode (actually, it was orange, according to the film), and the director didn't forget to include the shot of Dillinger jumping over the bank counter. Obviously the filmmakers took great care to re-create the early 1930s and Dante Spinotti's photography captures its atmosphere.

However, like in ""Heat"" and ""Collateral,"" director Michael Mann seems more interested in the two opposing personalities represented by Dillinger and the ace FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), than the life story of John Dillinger itself. His usual slow-burn approach works most effectively during the film's action scenes, setting up the mood slowly before leading us to the violent climax.

But there is something missing here, though where the weakness is, it is hard to pinpoint. Very charismatic Johnny Depp did a great job of becoming the legendary character, but his character doesn't explain why Dillinger had become a national legend. Oscar winner Marion Cotillard appears as his girlfriend Billie Frechette, but their romantic relation only help slow down the pace of the film. The film also features a strong supporting cast including Billy Crudup (as J. Edgar Hoover), Stephen Dorff, Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, David Wenham and very brief Leelee Sobieski, but not much time is given to them and the characters they play.

Thanks to the impressive acting from the leads, ""Public Enemies"" remains watchable, but despite its outstanding action scenes, the film is clearly not Mann's best, with so much potential (with Depp and Bale) wasted in the unfocused script that needs a compelling drama.",1264204800,,1868,5.240802675585284

3967304,5,B002QEHPQA,"Other reviews - negative ones - fault the movie for the overly quiet or mumbled dialogue, the quality of the filming, the dragging plot, etc. etc. etc.  Here's my take:

  1. The quiet dialogue was counterpoint to the raging violence, thus intensifying it.  (I had no trouble understanding the dialogue.) The similarity of tone between Depp and Bale pointed out the similarities and differences of character as well, helping to blur distinctions between the inner workings of lawmen and lawless.  Christian Bale's monotone was ideal for showing the singleminded intensity with which Purvis pursued Dillinger, and Depp's low voice as Dillinger stood in stark contrast to the violence he was willing to wreak.

  2. The filming seemed in keeping with the era being portrayed, falling into almost sepia tones at times, and having a film noir quality that is perfect for the subject matter.  The jerky hand-held camera gives the viewer the impression that one is watching a newsreel of the action and heightens the sense of viewer participation.  Because of this ""you are there"" quality, I wished I could duck behind something, too, as the bullets were zinging past.

  3. The plot was protracted to give a sense of the extended conflict between Dillinger and the government agents, to lend depth, and to heighten tension.

Marion Cotillard as Dillinger's softly wide-eyed lover, Billie Freschette, is the perfect pairing with Depp's piercingly intense portrayal of Dillinger.  The two together push the rest of the cast into the background.

I found the film to be brilliant in all its aspects.  Johnny Depp is a genius, and even if the film had no other redeeming factors (which it does, in plenty) his performance has ample merit to warrant the five star rating.",1263772800,4,1761,5.0137931034482754
3967305,5,B002QEHPQA,"The Bottom Line:

One of the 10-15 best films of 2009, Michael Mann's Public Enemies is a fascinating study of the rise of the FBI and the downfall of an age in American criminality; though a lot of events have been rearranged chronologically to suit the needs of the story, you'll hardly care while watching Depp's superb Dillinger or the typically impressive photography by Mann and cinematographer Spinotti.

3967306,3,B002QEHPQA,"Public Enemies is based on factual events and a real-life criminal. However, the film is actually pretty uninteresting. It is slow-paced and while there are some terrific actors in it, they all felt wasted in their roles. Christian Bale's character could have literally be played by anyone else. He was basically phoning in his performance. Very obvious but sad since he is such a great actor. Not his best role-in fact, probably one of his worst. More wasted actors include Billy Crudup and David Wenham(who had like 2 lines I think and I barely understood a word he said). As for the always talented Johnny Depp, well, performance-wise he was just fine. But I felt nothing for his character, neither sympathy or excitement. He always seems to be enjoying his roles, no matter what he does, but again, not his best here.

Plot-wise, well honestly, there is more talk than action. A couple of bank robberies, a fun prison escape, a gun battle-Nothing we haven't seen before. Even if you don't know the story behind Depp's character or his comrades, you sort of can guess what will happen and who will end up being killed. As for Marion Cotillard's character, I'm not sure what sort of effect she had on Dillinger in real life, so I can't really comment on how factual her performance was or her role in history, but again, she seemed sort of unnecessary.

Before I saw the film, I read about how grainy the film looks and how visually beautiful it was. Um no. It is very dark in some parts and it's hard to see certain things in alot of scenes. Not impressed with the cinematography at all.

Overall, I was dissapointed and somewhat bored with this film. I thought it would be far more interesting but it just felt like it was missing something important.",1263772800,,1755,4.636655948553055
3967307,2,B002QEHPQA,"This is a review of the movie -- not the Blu-ray -- and it does contain spoilers...

It seems that a lot of the five star reviews I've read here all seem to admit the film had little or no character development. How can you say a film is ""five stars"" that has no character development? It's true by the way. Public Enemies had little to no character development. That's fine if you're making a movie about Elvis or Santa Claus. The audience already has some idea who these characters are in their own minds. When you're dealing with men like John Dillinger and Melvin Purvis things tend to get a little more vague for some folks.

I saw Public Enemies in the theater. Loved the book by Bryan Burrough. I've also been a life-long Dillinger fan. Originally I had no desire to see this film half-expecting it to be bad. My curiosity eventually got the better of me. Where Johnny Depp soared in his larger than life take on guys like Ed Wood, George Jung and Hunter S. Thompson he went down like a lead balloon as Dillinger. John Herbert Dillinger was one of the most charismatic and charming criminals the world has ever known. Why then would Johnny Depp play him so tight-lipped? If you agree that Depp was tight-lipped in this film, Christian Bale as Purvis would have had no lips at all by comparison.

In short, this was not the same Dillinger and Purvis that really lived. Okay, I know. Stop right there. It's only a movie. But wait just a minute -- this was a movie based on a beautifully written and meticulously researched piece of nonfiction. So why then does Dillinger appear in the beginning of the film at the infamous Walter Dietrich Indiana State Penitentiary breakout of 1933 when he was serving time himself in Lima, Ohio? Sure, Dillinger helped plan the ten-man escape but he did it from inside a prison cell. Surely writer/director Michael Mann read the book he based his film on. Didn't he?

Why did Mann have to invent a scene like something out of Heat in which Dillinger (caged in a big cell  la Hannibal Lecter) has an actual confrontation with the man employed to catch him? Surely Dillinger and Purvis must have met like this in real-life? It had to be in the book too, right? Wrong. Dillinger was incarcerated in Crown Point, Indiana but he never met Purvis face-to-face. Ever. This was just pure made-up nonsense. Kind of like Purvis requesting outside help from experienced law enforcement professionals to combat the gangsters who were mowing-down his young white-collar agents with relative ease. In reality, it was Hoover (Purvis' boss) who brought in Charles Winstead and the other cowboy cops from Texas and Oklahoma because he thought Purvis was grossly incompetent. Turns out, Hoover was right. Purvis was a colossal failure. Hoover actually had him demoted. In fact, Purvis wasn't even in charge of the Dillinger investigation (Samuel Cowley was) in the final weeks leading up to Dillinger's eventual death. But he's still in charge in this movie. In fact, he's kind of portrayed as something of a reluctant hero; a taciturn stoic agent of the law. Sure he was.

Then we come to Little Bohemia in April 1934. Aside from using the real Northern Wisconsin location in the film, this entire portion of the story is pure fantasy. This is what we know happened: Purvis failed yet again to nab Dillinger but he did manage to kill an innocent bystander and wound two others in the process. This is what is shown in the movie: Purvis guns down Baby Face Nelson in the woods outside the lodge. Shenanigans. Nelson wasn't even shot there. He outlived Dillinger. As did half of the gang members that Mann kills off during his film (including Stephen Dorff as Homer Van Meter). I suppose this was done in an effort to make Dillinger look like the last of the gang and all that. I get it. Shenanigans.

Where in the film was Dillinger's well-known plastic surgery? Why they would choose to leave this critical bit of business out is beyond me. Instead, Mann has Dillinger walk undetected into the very office in downtown Chicago that has been created to catch him. He looks at photos on the wall of his old gang with the word ""DECEASED"" printed underneath them (even though most of them weren't dead yet in real-life) then he even stops and has a brief chat with some of the Agents who are listening to a ball game on a radio. Talk amongst yourselves on that one.

Don't even get me started on Billie Frechette, Dillinger's long-time sweetheart. Dillinger had A LOT of girlfriends in his day but this movie chooses to focus solely on this relationship. Okay. I'll buy it. But did we really need the standard issue, contrived, Hollywood love story in a shoot-em-up John Dillinger movie? It's all for dramatic effect I would presume. Mann also leaves out the fact that Billie spent the rest of her life capitalizing off her association with Dillinger and touring in a theatrical show with members of Dillinger's own family. She died of cancer in 1969. Juliet Capulet she was not.

After the Little Bohemia incident, the film dumps us right into the final hours. The place is the Biograph theater at 2433-43 North Lincoln Avenue in Chicago -- the scene of John Dillinger's death. If you want the real details of the incident, you should read the book Public Enemies or any of the other half-dozen or so books still in print about the life of John Dillinger. They are far more interesting and exciting than this film is. All you need to know is: Dillinger was betrayed by a woman, a madame named Ana Cumpanas (aka Anna Sage) who was in fear of being deported to Romania and cut a deal with Purvis to bring in Dillinger. A deal that Purvis later reneged on.

Special Agent Charles Winstead was the man who was later credited with getting the Dillinger killshot. He is played quite effectively by the underrated Stephen Lang. He and Mann worked together before on Manhunter. Back when Mann used to make good movies. In reality, Winstead went to the Marbro Theater first unlike his showy scene in the film. When determining which of the two suspected theaters Dillinger will be at, Winstead asks which movie is playing at both. He is told a Shirley Temple film and a Clark Gable gangster picture. He replies: ""John Dillinger will not be seeing a Shirley Temple movie"" or something to that effect. It was a cute line nonetheless.

The final scene plays out pretty much as I expected. Except for it being about 97% inaccurate. In reality, Purvis was sweating and shaking the whole time unlike Bale in the film who is never less than calm, cool and collected. There was a moment or two of chaos as the crowd emerged from the theater and some of the G-Men were fighting with the local cops and the theater manager (not in the movie) until finally Dillinger emerges with a girl on each arm. Despite a completely ridiculous camera shot of an overzealous (and near-retarded) Agent drawing his gun on the street about ten yards away from behind Dillinger (why weren't there any people screaming at the sight of this?) and then practically running toward him, they somehow managed to capture the actual moment of Dillinger's death PERFECTLY. It's by far the most accurate thing in the movie. Since the rest of the movie lumbers along like an old Chevy with four flat tires I can't help thinking this scene was gotten right by accident.

Was the film entertaining? Not nearly as enjoyable as The Untouchables was. At least The Untouchables didn't pretend to be historical drama and it wasn't based on a highly lauded work of nonfiction. The Untouchables was intended to be a Hollywood historical fantasy and it's certainly one of the most entertaining movies of it's kind. It's a modern gangster melodrama. Public Enemies isn't any of these things. To be honest, I don't know what it is.

Put simply: to me, the film has no soul. It is bland and predictable. The action is cluttered, the modern music throws it off and the performances fail to ignite any real depth or emotion. Worse yet, it's as if it were shooting for some level of drab realism yet it fell back on glossy convention every opportunity it had. I had a real hard time trying not to laugh during that cornball ending too with Frechette and Winstead. This film fails to even crack the surface of who John Dillinger was as a man. Dillinger was a charming, cold-blooded killer. He was without a doubt the most notorious and celebrated bank-robber this Country has ever seen. One of the biggest problems with this film for me was Mann hardly showed Dillinger robbing any banks at all. There's no real sense of time in the film or when things are actually happening. In the movie, John Dillinger tells us that he's a bank robber. There's the rub. Don't tell us, Johnny. Show us.",1263686400,7,8742,4.650485436893204
3967308,3,B002QEHPQA,"On the surface, Public Enemies seems to be about bank robbers.  But it's actually about the triumphs and travails of celebrities in a time of great upheaval - which is to say, it's about Hollywood today.

Johnny Depp, playing Dillinger, is charismatic, masculine, bold, even reckless.  He seems unwilling to admit that his lifestyle is a dead-end, preferring instead to live in the moment.  And yet he seeks human companionship in Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), swooping in to claim her as his ""girl"" without really asking her permission.  He is a titan among men, striding into her humdrum life to sweep Billie off her heels and, throwing caution to the wind, seek his own fortune.

Christian Bale, playing Special Agent Melvin Purvis, is the man tasked with taking Dillinger down.  He navigates the world of public opinion and the bumbling incompetency of a young FBI task force not yet hardened by adversity.  Purvis has a lot to prove, balancing his own morality with a new era of government ruthlessness.

This movie isn't really about facts, though.  A trip through Wikipedia shows the number of liberties - and there are many - that the movie took with actual events.  Instead, Michael Mann tries to craft a narrative out of the battle between these two sides, creating the classic duality where two actors at the top of their game face off.

Purvis is the principled, dark, brooding character that bucks authority and follows his own noble path by being smarter and more dedicated than the authorities in charge.  Dillinger is the wild man that criminals turn to, pushed to the edge because of the Great Depression and the law.  Both men have nothing to lose but their very souls.  If this sounds familiar, it's pretty much the same plot as The Dark Knight, only with gangsters instead of comic book villains.

For all the great action sequences, close-ups, and monologues, there isn't much we know about the characters in the end.  Without the benefit of a prequel like The Dark Knight, Purvis is as much a cipher as Dillinger.  Missing is the exploration of the environments that helped craft the careers of both men, and it becomes clear that Mann is more interested in making modern analogies (about torture, about wiretapping, and government abuse in general) than sharing a sense of history.

And that's the problem.  While Public Enemies retells the tale, more or less, of the rise and fall of Dillinger, it fails to provide the backdrop for why it happened.  We get occasional insights into the evolution of the FBI, but not of public sentiment, of the Great Depression, of how society helped create cops and robbers.  At one point Dillinger provides a veiled reference to his past that's just as cryptic as the Joker's - because it doesn't really matter.  This movie isn't about why things happened; it's more about giving two actors their chance to shine.

In that regard Public Enemies is a success.  It's long, filled with philosophical dialogue and occasionally improbable shootouts. Although there's a stab at some kind of pathos, connecting Dillinger's own devil-may-care lifestyle with his romance (""blackbird""), it feels contrived. The most compelling character is steel-eyed Charles Winstead, played by the awesome Stephen Lang.

3967313,3,B002QEHPQA,"Public Enemies was a disappointment. Not of colossal proportions, but nonetheless, not as good as I thought it would be.
Sadly, the biggest offense is that is was dull. I watched an hour long documentary on the Depression era bank robbers featured in the film and it was far more entertaining. Amazingly, this film manages to take what was a wild ride by a criminal who defied belief with his jail escapes and good fortune and turned it into a plodding half-baked love story coupled with an equally underdeveloped character study of the main two ""public enemies,"" Dillinger and Purvis.
An additional problem (that others noted as well) is the dialogue. Depp in particular mumbles a lot and I had to re-start from the beginning with the subtitles on to catch a good quarter of the dialogue I'd have otherwise missed. With today's filmmaking techniques, that's inexcusable. First of all, why have an actor mumble his lines and secondly, why not try to overdub them?
Depp's Dillinger is predictably roguish, but the only real moment I felt the actor was stretching beyond a smirking exercise was after his gal was arrested. Depp can do much better but he was clearly type-cast and not really required to flex his acting muscle. As for Bale's Purvis...let me ask this; does Christian Bale know how to act beyond the same cold-blooded, wooden persona that brought him fame in American Psycho? Through a good half dozen roles I've seen him perform; he never changes or shows any range whatsoever.
This seemed like a great opportunity to tell a tale about a man whose life was legendary, but the director (and I suppose the author of the book the movie was based on) spread things too thin and thus nothing stands out. It's as flat as the midwestern countryside that serves as much of the backdrop.
It isn't horrible by any means, but it is not nearly as good as a story about the infamous John Dillinger could have and should have been. Like the hapless law enforcement officers chasing the elusive Dillinger, the director lets things slip through his fingers.",1262822400,,2054,4.772471910112359

Other reviewers here have complained at length about cinematography and camera usage but for me, the real sinker is this non-existent, beyond pathetic script which is nothing more than two hours of one-liners attempting to portray how ""suave"" and ""charming"" Mr. Dilinger was (which historically we know, he wasn't). It is as if no one actually read this thing before they filmed it and then threw it together without much (if any) editing. Marion Cotillard's character develops a bizarre and unexplained accent at the end of the film which had the audience actually laughing while she was being beaten to a pulp. And the ABSURD and repetitive scenes of Dilinger narrowly escaping being caught by a bunch of keystone cops is also laughable, unoriginal, and just plain stupid. Why the so-called writers felt they had to restate the point over and over that ""Dilinger is so much smarter than the cops"" (laugh laugh, wink wink) was insulting.",1262822400,12,1116,4.787564766839378

3967318,3,B002QEHPQA,"I really wanted to love this movie but it just tried to do too much in too short of time.

The main character of this film is John Dillinger(Depp) who Michael Mann attempts to make into a sympathetic character by giving him a love story but we also see Dillinger shoot several cops; guns them down without a second thought.  Meanwhile, we have the lead ""good guy"" in Melvin Purvis(Bale) who has almost half the screen time that Depp has.  He is shown as a sometimes inspiring lead but also an arrogant or inept leader who resorts to heavy-handed tactics sometimes.  What happens is that we the audience ends up not really caring about either.

When telling a story, you need a protaganist and you need an antagonist; good guy and bad guy.  There was neither in this film.

Another aspect was that they tried to bring in so many other undercurrents, such as the conflict between Purvis and Hoover and the eventual falling out of Dillinger with the Chicago Syndicate.  Neither of these was fully told or explained and really took time away from the two main actors.

As for the supporting cast, I was shocked to learn AFTER watching the film that such actors as David Wendham and Stephen Dorff were in this film because they had maybe a combined 5 minutes screentime.  So another issue was that there were way too many minor characters who were poorly defined.  You have to watch the movie several times to get who is Homer and who is Pierpont...

Another issue was that alot of the dialogue was tough to understand.  I don't know if the actors were just all mumbling or what but many of the lines went unheard.

Maybe if Michael Mann had spent another hour in this film to fully flesh out the characters and give them defined roles, maybe cut out some of the minor characters and then maybe create some real drama between the characters...then this would have been a good film.

I've never encountered this on Satellite, Laserdisc, DVD, or Blu Ray before; using multiple versions of components.

All the reviews I've looked at (on review site) all declare the dialogue to be entirely intelligible, so perhaps I have a bad pressing, but I can't imagine that is possible.

This audio issue prevented me from hearing a good chunk of dialogue (and yes my volume was set so high the ""action scenes"" were theater-ish) so I really could not appreciate the experience.  Leaning forward, upping the volume when a dialogue scene came on, then lowering it when it looked like the guns were starting to blaze was entirely distracting.

3967327,3,B002QEHPQA,"John Dillinger, one of the most prolific bank robbers in all of American history, once again serves as the subject matter for a movie. 75 years after Dillinger's infamous death at the hands of the FBI, acclaimed director Michael Mann (""Heat"") brings his vision of the popular criminal's sordid history to life with ""Public Enemies"".

""Public Enemies"" follows the notorious exploits of bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), a man both extremely dangerous and yet, well loved by the public who saw him as a modern-day Robin Hood. After being declared the FBI's top priority by J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), Dillinger and his band of criminals engage in a seemingly never-ending game of cat and mouse with government agents led by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). As the game escalates even further, it becomes increasingly clear that a deadly final showdown between the law and the lawless is inescapable.

This film, ""Public Enemies"", is the eighth attempt at brining Dillinger's story to life. After so many previous versions one can't help but wonder, ""What could Michael Mann's newest iteration of the outlaw's tale possibly have to say that hasn't already been said?""

For starters, this version of John Dillinger and his criminal exploits is more historically accurate than anything previously done; although, that's not to say that this one isn't without its share of fallacies (in truth there are numerous ones). Written by Ronan Bennet, Michael Mann, and Ann Biderman (""Primal Fear"") the story plays out similarly to Mann's previous heist film, ""Heat""; however, despite the similarities in pacing and structure, the film doesn't feel like a retread. Unlike, ""Heat"" which was a character driven heist drama, this film is almost 100% a character study. While there are several bank heist sequences within the movie, the majority of the film is spent on exploring the various aspects of Dillinger's life; from his loves to his own criminal moral code (yes, he does have a code he lives by) to his relationship with the media and the common man. Truth be told, had this film not focused more on the person rather than the crimes then it wouldn't have been nearly as engaging, because at that point it becomes just another heist movie.

While I enjoyed the examination of John Dillinger's life, there were moments of the film that could have been edited out to make the pacing flow better. Several times throughout some of the scenes between Dillinger and Billie (his lover), and other scenes not featuring those two, the story begins to slow to a crawl. I believe Michael Mann and his editing team should have noticed this problem and been more judicious in their cuts; therefore removing those lulls in the story. Had this happened then the movie would have been much tighter, potentially more engaging for the audience (given that too many lulls can cause interest to wane), and brought the running time down closer to the two hour mark which most audience members seem to prefer. That's not to say that because of these pacing issues that I didn't enjoy the movie, I still enjoyed it, I just recognize that there are ways it could have been made better.

Of course, when dealing with an historical drama, one must discuss the accuracy of events being depicted or lack thereof, whatever the case may be. In this instance, the screenplay stays close to the realm of historical fact, but there are several instances where creative license comes into play for a more dramatic effect or the film just blatantly rearranges events from history to suit its needs.

The creative license is most prominently on display during a scene around the middle of the film where FBI agent Melvin Purvis meets John Dillinger for the first time. According to commonly accepted history; these two men never formally met each other. Although the scene is pivotal within the cat-and-mouse game being played by the two men; the fact that it never happened and was added in for dramatic purposes is frustrating when watching a film one presumes to be based on fact. Plus, the timing of the scene within the movie lends some credence to the comparison being drawn between this film and ""Heat"", as the two main characters in that film first meet in a key scene around the middle of that movie as well.

Other problems within the film's storyline would be the noticeable inaccuracies surrounding numerous murders. A few key plot points within the film hinge upon the deaths of certain individuals; however, their deaths either don't occur in the manner depicted or within the timeframe being referenced. Another area of contention for some is whether or not John Dillinger actually had a romance with Billie Frechette. While the depiction of the romance within the film is not necessarily inaccurate, it's also not a concrete fact.

While the film is steeped mostly in fact and presents the most historically accurate account of John Dillinger's criminal life, I find myself disappointed by some of the decisions made for dramatic purposes within the story. To me, if you're going to make a movie based on an actual person that references other actual people and events, then do not modify history to suit your needs. Instead, present the story as accurately as possible with only minor creative license being employed for the areas that are not completely certain in history's eyes.

I understand that many historical dramas contain numerous inaccuracies in order to create a more dramatic piece of cinema (to be honest, I thoroughly enjoy many of them). Although, whether I enjoy the film or not, the facts should not be ignored, rearranged, or manipulated in excess. I admit that I enjoy ""Public Enemies"", but I must acknowledge that the inconsistencies between the film and reality do detract from my overall enjoyment.

An area that excels despite the historical inaccuracies, and does the best it can as far as actual likenesses go, is the film's casting. No matter what the subject matter, whenever Michael Mann sets out to make a film he always manages to attract A-list talent and this movie is no exception.

Leading the cast is the chameleon-like Johnny Depp (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy), playing what could be considered his most normal role, in terms of appearance and mannerisms, in years. Depp exudes throughout the film all of the confidence, charm, and charisma that helped make John Dillinger into one of the most popular criminals (among the people) of all time. Even when brandishing a loaded weapon while robbing a bank, John's moral code allowed him to be continually viewed as a Robin Hood of sorts. This strange dichotomy of a man, seen as both hero and villain, would be a complicated role to undertake, yet Depp plays the duality that comprises John Dillinger effortlessly. With this role, Johnny Depp proves once more why he is one of the best actors of his generation.

In the main supporting roles are two equally impressive talents, Christian Bale (""The Dark Knight"") as FBI agent Melvin Purvis and actress Marion Cotillard (""La Vie en Rose"") as Billie Frechette. Christian Bale adopts another American accent yet again, but there did seem to be some minor wavering in the accent's consistency throughout the movie. Purvis has a slight southern drawl, which is different from the typical American accent Bale usually adopts (as seen in ""The Dark Knight""). Perhaps, adding the southern inflection made the accent more difficult to master. Despite the small drawback (it wasn't much at all); Christian still delivered an excellent performance that easily stands toe-to-toe with Johnny Depp's.

Academy Award winning actress Marion Cotillard portrays John Dillinger's supposed lover, Billie Frechette. Marion conveys such grace, warmth, and strength that she is instantly captivating in the surprisingly complicated role. In the beginning Billie is the quiet girl who is unsure of this charismatic man who has taken an interest in her; however, once she starts to immerse herself into Dillinger's world she quickly shows the inner strength that had been laying in wait. Just like Johnny Depp's role of John Dillinger was filled with duality and complexity, Billie offered Marion nearly the same challenges and she easily rose to meet them. Of course, one would expect nothing less from this Academy Award winning actress.

Lastly, actor Billy Crudup (""Watchmen"") shows up in several scenes (amounting to nothing more than an extended cameo) as FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover. Billy is a consistently reliable actor who has never really broken through in popularity despite roles in high-profile films, such as ""Mission: Impossible 3"" and ""Watchmen"". Even with Billy's consistent track record of performances, I feel that his portrayal in this film is too flat and ultimately ineffective, making Hoover appear completely uninteresting and uncharismatic. While there doesn't appear to be a definitive consensus on just how charismatic J. Edgar Hoover truly was or wasn't in reality. By my estimation, if a man can amass the level of power and influence Hoover did, he wouldn't be able to do so if he was anything remotely resembling the depiction in this film.

In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Public Enemies"" despite the brief lulls and slightly overlong run time; however, the historical inaccuracies lower my opinion of this film to an extent. If you ask me, historical inaccuracies to this degree (which is quite substantial in some instances) should never be allowed no matter how beneficial they may be to the overall dramatic narrative.

I loved this movie. I loved it so very much i plan on watching it again very soon. Also i'm hearing alot that it contains alot of historical inaccuracy, which now has led me to look into that and read some literature on Dillinger. I loved Depp, he is so charismatic in everything he does and as for Bale, it was soooo nice to hear him speak normally without the batman growl(which he also had in terminator salvation).
I loved the clothes, the cars, the scenery. I guess being from the area where alot of the movie was filmed perhaps holds some sort of intrigue for me that it may not for others.
Now, in reviewing the actual product itself i must agree that this transfer to blu ray is very much lacking in quality. It must just be me however cos i found about half of this movie to look wonderful, but then there are some scenes that incredibly grainy. i even pulled up closer to my tv to inspect, and yes i did notice that.

Unfortunately, this well-made yet narratively thin retelling of John Dillinger's 1933-34 crime spree cannot sustain its 140-minute length. The vigorous shootouts and Depression-era period detail remain impressive, but the dramatic impact is oddly subdued. Despite this drawback, there's plenty of star power from Johnny Depp's Dillinger and Christian Bale's Melvin Purvis - both ideally cast in the classic tradition.

Although the film is certainly better than the average gangster flick lately, it spends too much time being a chase film and no time developing the characters. Giovanni Ribisi in particular is completely wasted here and Depp and Bale seem one note!

I will probably need to see this a couple of times to see if I'm missing something here, but overall the director just doesn't know what film he wants to make. It's neither historically accurate nor over the top entertaining and with so many fine actors involved it's really surprising that any of this film seems flat. To its credit, the film runs 2 hours and 20 minutes and I remained interested throughout, but never completely engrossed. This is something I take for granted with a cast like this.

3967337,5,B002QEHPQA,"Micheal Mann has yet to make a bad movie. I think he is one of the best directors in Hollywood today and would say his work is comparable only to that of Terrance Malik. In all honesty I haven't liked Depp in a film since ""Sleepy Hollow"", this is the first time in years I think he actually became a character other than Johhny Depp. I have heard a lot of people talk poorly of this film, especially in terms of dialog and Christian Bale's performance. In my opinion, what Mann is going for, as he usually does, is a sense of realism. I have read many reviews that have said ""Public Enemies"" is a good film, but it's no ""Heat"". ""Heat"" has been and will always be one of my favorite films, but ""Public Enemies"" matches it and goes beyond it in many ways. Mann's use of digital hand cameras brings something to cinema that no other director has managed to do, making the viewer feel apart of the action and not just a voyeur. He gets close to the actors and you can actually see the imperfections of an actors face, wrinkles, scars and all. The dialog is more down to earth than it was in ""Heat"", while we all love watching actors have long in-depth conversations about the meaning of their characters existence, let's be honest, how often does that happen in life? While this may be why we go to the movies, it's unrealistic especially when dealing with ""street smart"" characters. As much as I love the coffee scene in ""Heat"", I find it hard to believe that a conversation between a career cop and a hardened thief would be so articulate. Bale's performance in this film is excellent. Yes, he is quiet and doesn't have a whole lot of lines, but he shouldn't. Bale's character is a man on the verge, suicidal, and unqualified to do the job he's assigned. He's more or less a paid assassin with a badge, knows it, and hate's himself for it. His dialog and actions fit his character and he plays it well. If you're looking a Hollywood blockbuster, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a smart film that is filmed beautifully and breaks the mold for how movies need to be told, it doesn't get any better. This is not a gangster film, it is just a film and despite that the fact that it won't, should win best picture this year. If you didn't like ""Miami Vice"" you probably won't like this. Mann once again manages to blur the line between cop and criminal, good and bad and shows men doing what they need to do to get by in the world, there viewer can't help but feel compassion for all the characters no matter what moral side they stand on.

Each one of these films show a different perspective of the life and times of the infamous gangster. Personally, I like the charismatic performance of Warren Oates as Dillinger and the overall film directed by John Milius,historically the 1945,1973,versions are probably the most accurate,the 1945 version was shot in a short seventy seven minutes. Public Enemies is accurate in the history of Dillinger,in a different order of sequences,though the script doesn't explain the break out scene and the wooden gun to viewers that are not familiar with the exploits of John Dillinger portrayed by the laid back Johnny Depp,maybe a little ""too"" laid back for the part,almost subdued. Christian Bale does his part as G-man Melvin Purvis. Marion Cotillard ""is"" Dillinger's girl in her role. Stephen Graham is the notorious ""baby face"" Nelson. Loaded with shootouts,bullets flying like the old west,the film is expertly directed by Michael Mann,Public Enemies is like the real deal,it takes you back to 1933. If there was one flaw in the film,the title tells the story,the war or rivalry between Purvis and Dillinger,director Mann and the writers fall short of capturing this and the character study of the two actors,Depp and Bale. One scene in the film, in their only confrontation,Purvis walks his way out towards the cell block door, Dillinger says, ""better find yourself another line of work Melvin"" this single line actually saves the scene. The film is entertaining,long,but not drawn out.  The two disc special edition includes ""the making of"",and a short documentary of the real John Dillinger and other outlaws of the era.",1260748800,2,1757,5.342960288808665

I read the breif history and also read it to my husband.  This way we both had a little background on the main character before watching the movie.  I wish they would make more movies like this one.

3967340,4,B002QEHPQA,"I normally shy away from any movies over the hour and half reasonable limit and I surprised myself by sitting and watching the entire two hours of this.  My first impression was ""too much testosterone"" as the gangsters (in their awesome suits and fedoras.. why don't men dress like that anymore??) break out of jail, have a shoot out, rob a bank, get caught again, break out of jail again, have another shoot out.. but the romance between Johnny and Billie (Billie is a woman) adds enough intrigue to keep the ladies interested.

I thought it was interesting as all get out watching the beginnings of what is now the F.B.I.  Very well done, but they did appear to be incompetents most of the time.  My favorite part:  When Johnny walks right into the Chicago Police Department and views his very own crime scene boards and even asks about the Cubs game on the radio.

The story is disjointed because Mann didn't decide whose story he was going to tell - so he tried to tell them all.  Leaving a movie that jumps, leaves actors without being able to fulfull their story.  Both Depp and Bale deliver excellent performances, but with their story uncompleted (you need to watch the extra features to understand) they seem missing.  Also, by spending time on other characters (Hoover, Pretty boy Floyd, etc.) you don't get to really connect with any character.  As usual, the history is manipulated for the movie, but the manipulation doesn't help the movie.

3967342,1,B002QEHPQA,"If this dank, dark, mumbling period piece was directed by some slump of a director I would've given it two stars, out of compassion or pity. But this one was Michael Mann's. A true artist, a hero of mine, creator of fine entertainments like Heat, The Last of the Mohicans, Miami Vice (the TV series) and Collateral. He's proved and re-proved he's a cinematic genius. But here, the aim must've been money, not a reach for a true creative piece.

Public Enemies better describes the deal makers here, putting together a celebrity-driven, ripe-for-hype piece of tripe. Every performer kept the same expression (dour, sullen, numb) throughout the 140 minutes of the same-seeming machine-gunning, sepia-tinted crime spree. Okay, bad word; nothing in this drumming, same-old flick was spree-full. I guess like too-many sequel series (Lethal Weapon comes immediately to mind; LW4 is never-ending schtick, so cliched it was painful to watch, a true waste of time and talent). I I lament creativity and pride wearing out, go lame. This sad flick limps from spree-less start to finish. No memorable characterizations, certainly no entertainment. Nothing surprises or impresses, is memorable or laudable. Well, maybe if you're an antique-car buff you might get a tingle.

Mann had a knack of delivering great action without trite devices while creating great characters and complex, sophisticated plots. I guess when money's the object, that appetite for greatness withers. I'm so sorry, and abit mad for Mr. Mann's final movies (I assume he'll want more moolah before he goes gently into the night) swirl around the bowl. Lesson learned: When a great director nears the end of his career, best to rent his final opus' before adding it to your collection. Creatively, caveat emptor.

As for the much-promoted J. Depp and C. Bale; well, they're not at the ends of their careers. But a few more
projects like Public Enemies will move them alot closer to that fabled light at the end of the long tunnel. Their
characters and performances in Public Enemies will fade fast. I'm trying to forgive this flick even as I write this.",1260662400,2,2112,5.0285714285714285

I actually avoided seeing this in the theater (Even though I wanted to) for this very reason. I was warned by a fellow film maker, who was excited to see this as well, just how bad much of this film looks. I have a lot of respect for Michael Mann. However, I recent films he seems to have decided that scenes don't need to be lit or the correct color balance to be acceptable. Sometimes I can see this being valid. But, not in this film. In one scene, a face will look as though they are suffering with jaundice, and then the very next scene normal again. If I wanted to see a film where the image is dark or inappropriately discolored I can go to Youtube. I'm pretty sure that they had the budget for both a light meter and a color meter. Or someone on set that could at least say "" Hey this is tungsten, or this is daylight"" or ""Shouldn't we check our exposure?"". You went to the effort to film in the accurate locations only to see every thing too dark or in a muddled greenish yellow hue that ruined it. You could have had a great film here, but instead it left me angry over what could have been. Also, for the first 20 minute or so I had to keep rewinding the film to try and understand what was being said.

3967345,4,B002QEHPQA,"Michael Mann directed and co-wrote ""Public Enemies"", drawing on Bryan Burrough's book ""Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34"" to follow John Dillinger's 1933-1934 crime spree and the hunt to bring him to justice. In the depths of the Great Depression, bank robbers have become folk heroes in the eyes of many Americans, and John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) revels in his public image. The Bureau of Investigation in Washington, DC, under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), vows to stop the crime spree. Hoover declares Dillinger ""Public Enemy #1"" and appoints Southern lawman Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) to head a team in Chicago that will capture Dillinger by means of modern technology and old-fashioned ruthlessness.

This is classic Michael Mann. ""Public Enemies"" flaunts big guns, fast cars, and stylish suits. Mann has chosen to portray the 1930s with the same edginess and energy as the present, which is in keeping with the film's choice of perspectives: It is about the experiences of two men, Dillinger and Purvis, rather than historical context. To this end, Purvis is somewhat idealized, Dillinger's romance with Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) is given more significance than it probably had, and a lot of dates and details are altered to better serve the character arcs. For example, most of the outlaws who die before Dillinger in the film actually died after him. ""Public Enemies"" is stylish and entertaining, but it's best to take the details with a grain of salt, though the story is true in the general sense.

The artistic license didn't bother me. This was the last generation of American outlaws whose exploits captured the public's imagination. Their legacy has always been a hybrid of fact and fiction. I would have preferred more historical context, though. The poverty and unemployment of the Great Depression facilitated John Dillinger's rapid ascent to folk hero status, and the evolving economics of organized crime syndicates did much to bring him down. The writers pay lip service to these forces, but they don't integrate well into the narrative, which tends to focus on personalities and events. Granted, those are more up Michael Mann's alley than history. I just felt that the greater story got the least attention. But the cast is top-notch, and ""Public Enemies"" is enjoyable as a stylish period action film.

The DVD (Universal 2009 singe disc): The single disc edition includes one featurette and an audio commentary. ""Larger Than Life: Adversaries"" (10 min) interviews Michael Mann, Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Melvin Purvis' son Alvin Purvis and others about the real characters of Purvis and Dillinger and the research the actors did. The audio commentary by Michael Mann is constant and informative. He talks about his approach to the material and contributes historical details, including how the Dillinger Gang operated. But he doesn't say what details and events have been altered for the film, which would have been helpful. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish, French. DVS is also available for the visually impaired.",1260662400,2,3187,5.208576998050682

But yet in the movie there was no mention of Saint Paul or the shoot-out he had had there with local law enforcement.
The Little Bohemia Resort... what a mess that was! It didn't happen anything like they depicted it in the movie. The truth about what happened there that night would have played much better.

It might have been a little long but overall it was well done. The acting was superb & there was plenty of shoot em up action. The best part was the fact that this was a tale from the 1930s and I love the 1930-1940 gangster movies.
This of course did not have the charm of that era, nor did it have a Cagney, Bogart, or Robinson as well as Warner Brothers production values of that era to make the movie a superior effort but the cast was more than adequate. I loved watching those chase scenes in those older 1930s style automobiles.
Part of me thinks that if the producers of films back then had the budget to make a film like this they most likely would have. One thing I liked about this movie was the story of how Dillinger met and fell for Billie Frechette (played by Marion Cotillard). Usually in the old crime dramas, the head crime boss usually had his 'dame'(as called in that era) already with him and in love with him. In this movie we get to see exactly just how a lady would fall for a crime boss. I thought it was a nice touch.
Still better was the fact that this was a PG-13 - so the gore in this is purely your typical gunfire gore - I personally didn't find it overly bloody. Even better was the fact there was no scenes of a character vomiting which has become a standard in most newer films these days. It seems like every new movie (even Transformers & the latest Harry Potter film had this) has an obligatory barf scene which to me is unnecessary and not entertaining at all.
Overall this was very good and while this might not be an all time classic, fans of older crime dramas and gangster films should find this to their liking..

Wow. This movie was intensely boring. I'm a huge Michael Mann and Johnny Depp fan, and this movie was not even remotely what I was expecting. It was two hours and twenty minutes of slow, which I don't necessarily mind; however, when it is made impossible to get emotionally invested in a character, you just get bored. I didn't remotely care about what happened to anyone in this movie. There was no depth to any character in this film.

I gave it two stars instead of one because Christian Bale wasn't grunting like an obese man who had just ran a mile. Seriously, Christian, Michael Keaton could change his tone of voice without sounding like Cookie Monster; I'm sure you could, as well. Work on that before you start filming the next Batman, please.

Anyway: Boredom, no depth.

As for the Blu-ray transfer, I would really like it if Universal Studios spent as much time coming up with a decent digital transfer as they do on working on all of the U-Control nonsense on their Blu-ray discs. I was really getting tired of looking at a gorgeous scene of Agent Purvis hunting down a gangster in an apple orchard and then having to watch a grainy, white-specked scene of Dillinger driving a car.

3967357,5,B002QEHPQA,"Ranking up there with his best works, namely Heat and Thief, Michael Mann's Public Enemies is a spectacular true crime saga, focusing on notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) in the booming crime wave of the 1930s.  At the behest of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), G-man Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) leads the charge to bring down Dillinger, no matter the cost.  In the meantime, Dillinger romances the beautiful Billie Frechette (Marion Cottillard) as he moves from one big score to the next, all the while the cat & mouse game between him and Purvis continues to escalate.  Shot on HD video, Public Enemies at times looks both spectacular and just plain blurry, but from a technical standpoint otherwise, the film is wonderful.  On the acting side of things, Depp, Bale, and Cottillard are spectacular; while Mann manages to assemble a cast that also includes Stephen Graham as Baby Face Nelson, Stephen Dorff, Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Lang, David Wenham, John Ortiz, Brotherhood's Jason Clarke, Rory Cochrane, Emile de Ravin, Leelee Sobieski, and Channing Tatum in a blink and you'll miss him turn as Pretty Boy Floyd.

All in all, Public Enemies ranks high on the list of Michael Mann's best films, and that in itself makes the film a worthwhile experience.",1260403200,5,1483,5.057377049180328
3967358,3,B002QEHPQA,"Great movie - no problem there. However, besides the three or four main people, the acting was terrible.

Yes, movies can take some liberties on the truth, however SO MANY facts were just not correct (i.e. The movie has Baby Face Nelson dying AT Little Bohemia). The ORIGINAL story is so compelling, why even need to ""add in"" and ""take away"" from the truth?",1260403200,13,357,4.578125
3967359,2,B002QEHPQA,"With the recent trend of films attempting to be historically accurate, such as ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"" which used correct clothing, firearms, horse tackle, etc., and showed the overall poor marksmanship of many alleged gunmen in the scene that showed the murder of Wood Hite, I expected all of this and more from ""Public Enemies.""
Instead, it failed to match ""Dillinger"" with Warren Oates or even the unavailable black-and-white ""Baby Face Nelson"" with Mickey Rooney. Playing fast and loose with the facts really spoiled the film. For instance:
Melvin Purvis was not with the posse in Oklahoma that gunned down an unarmed Charles ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd in a dirt field, Oct. 22, 1934 - three months after Dillenger was killed; unless knowing the Dillinger story ahead of time, the viewer was clueless about certain characters and incidents throughout the film - rather than the one scene in ""Titanic"" showing the Strauses embracing as water flooded their cabin; there are too many inaccuracies about the escape at Little Bohemia to list; following the killing of an unarmed Dillinger, July 22, 1934, Baby Face Nelson was made Public Enemy No. 1 and was killed by two FBI agents who died of wounds received in the gun battle, Nov. 27, 1934 - four months after Dillinger and a month after Floyd was killed.
Finally, as there was no inter league baseball in 1934, New York sportscaster Werrner Wolf pointed out that the fictional scene of Dillinger in the police station hit an all-time low by having the police listening to a New York Yankees-Chicago Cubs game.
If I want to watch a gangster film for the action, I'll was my DVD of ""Scarface."" If I want to watch something about Dillinger, I'll check out the History Channel.",1260403200,3,1757,4.86

3967361,5,B002QEHPQA,"Nearly one hundred reviews for this film... and not one mentions what I wish to discuss.  Not surprising, really.  In fact, I missed it myself the first time I saw the film.  I experienced Public Enemies in the theatre upon its release, and came in with high expectations.  Michael Mann's films are (for me) always an experience to be savored, and once again I was not disappointed.  But I confess I missed it.  And I have no idea why.  Because it is so obvious.  What I am referring to is what I will call Mann's ""off center"" tendencies.  Now, I am not referring to Mann's political, moral or social views but more accurately, his penchant (at least in this film) for framing his actors dramatically to the left or right of the center of the screen.  From the opening moments - when we see Johnny Depp's John Dillinger (several months prior to achieving ""Public Enemy #1"" status) being ferried back to prison for what we will ultimately come to find out is a bloody prison break attempt - Mann sets his characters well off center.  And leaves them there.  Watching the film again last night, I saw this most clearly.  In fact, if you pay close attention, you will discover that Mann uses this technique throughout the two hour and twenty minute drama.  Shot after shot, frame after frame, we experience the rollicking, rumbling, scrambling, violent world that Dillinger and his crew inhabit as if we are sitting or standing right beside them.  And as I watched the film for a second time, it became shockingly apparent to me why Mann chose to do this.  He is showing us the entire world these men inhabit.  A complete world.

Mann is known for his relentless pursuit of exacting detail, often going so far as to tell his actors what color and brand of socks their characters would choose to wear.  And with Enemies, cinematographer Dante Spinotti (who Mann has thankfully returned to working with) goes to great lengths to display all of Mann's eccentric efforts.  Whether it is a shot of Dillinger and his girlfriend Billie Frechette (achingly played by Marion Cotillard) seated at a crowded restaurant, a glimpse of Dillinger - double barreled and growling orders with a weapon in each hand - holding at bay both bank employees and customers alike, or a frame of FBI Agent Melvin Purvis (a lock jawed and in control Christian Bale) straining to shut out the tortured screams of a captured member of Dillinger's crew... Mann and Spinotti make certain to show viewers every inch of the world these loners drift in and out of.  We see not only the two young lovers sharing fleeting moments together, but we are allowed to see the world closing in around them.  We see not only Dillinger's expertise in his craft, but the fear and slight respect in the bank customer's eyes.  And finally, we see not only Purvis' angst and uncertainty surrounding the direction his job is taking him, but the gore and filth in which he is forced to produce results.  And in doing so, Mann succeeds in two things: The aforementioned entrance into this other world, and the emphasis on the loneliness and despair that each character feels throughout the film.  It is a remarkable achievement.  And I submit to you that Mann keeps his characters off center for the entirety of the film, with the stark exception of two occasions:

One is when Dillinger - by now stripped of his one true love and oozing pain out of every pore - steels himself in a pronounced display of balls (there is no other word for it) and marches brazenly into the Chicago Police Department's Dillinger Task Force squad room.  From the second Dillinger steps into the elevator, Mann and Spinotti place him front and center in this moment.  Watch as he sidles through the squad room unnoticed, glancing at painful images of his fallen crew, his bloody path of destruction, and finally, himself.  In each shot, Mann plants Dillinger squarely in your face.  Right up until he asks a group of lazy cops the score of the radio broadcast baseball game.  Oh, and don't think for a moment these flatfoots even notice who he is.  And out the door he rolls... back into his off center world.

The second such time is the far more painful - and bloody - confrontation between Purvis' team of hired hands and Dillinger himself in the ill-fated final moments of the film.  Watch as Dillinger - smirking yet a bit spent - exits the soon-to-be famous Biograph Theatre and walks ever forward toward a fate we are led to believe he has already accepted... until he turns to face the men he senses behind him.  At this moment Mann again thrusts Dillinger directly into your face.  And what was to the left and to the right of the man become far less important, until the fatal shots ring out and Dillinger falls, mortally wounded, to the blood soaked sidewalk.

With the exception of these two instances, Mann's shot selection reminds us of what lies just outside each character's peripheral vision.  And in doing so, perhaps Mann has succeeded in doing a third thing.  Perhaps, just perhaps, Mann has succeeded in reminding each and every viewer that the world in which we all reside is just a bit larger than we realize.  We all live in a complete world.  And Mann is the master at showing it to us.",1260316800,3,5235,4.633405639913232
3967362,3,B002QEHPQA,"Some great segments that never come together to be a great movie.  Ultimately an incomplete, unsatisfactory cinema experience with muted acting and action that never quite delivers. I'm a great fan of Depp but he's not at his best here, neither are other actors (if you want to see Marion Cotillard at her best, see La Vien Rose instead).  As for Christian Bale, it's getting tiresome to see him repeat his square jawed, dead serious characterization again.  No need to really discuss the plot since most of us know the story of Dillinger, so it all comes down to how Mann draws us into the journey.  Too bad he ends up shooting blanks.  Wanna see Mann near his directorial top?  See Collateral instead.",1260316800,,703,4.67479674796748
3967363,3,B002QEHPQA,"I had the satisfaction of seeing a real gangster movie before viewing this one. It is the first Dillinger movie starring Warren Oates and Richard Dreyfuss. It is non stop action from Beginning to end, and no gangsters cry! Melvin Purvis is played by Ben Johnson , A ruthless man who never complains,chomps on cigars, and walks through a wall of bullets unscathed. Christian Bale plays Purvis in this new one, and is seen complaining to his superiors about his men being slaughtered. John Depp plays Dillinger, and crys when he is not able to see his girl, because the feds are interrogating her. I think the director(Mann)tried to show that these  guys were human, but who wants getting in touch with your feminine side in a gangster movie. Christian Bale does not play the tough guy well. Thank God we had the performance of Heath Ledger to save the Dark Knight movie. Bale sounded like he had bronchitis in Dark Knight. Anyway back to the review of this movie. Rent or buy Dillinger (Warren Oates)and see for yourself what tough gangsters should be like. and by the way this is no thug(c)rap group, it's a movie!!!!!!",1260316800,,1119,4.680203045685279
3967364,5,B002QEHPQA,"Public Enemies is undoubtably one of, if not, the greatest film to be released in 2009, with Inglourious Basterds a close second.  Mann's direction is spot on. Johnny Depp delivers another Oscar worthy performance as does Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. As for the Blu Ray, the picture is perfect. The audio is riveting(gunshot's really sound like gunshots). However the dialogue is a bit difficult to understand at times but I think this is the fault of who ever was operating the boom mike at the time. I can't comment on the Special Features as I have not watched them yet. I am thrilled to say that Public Enemies has received an excellent and much deserved Blu Ray encode, one of the best I have seen. A must own for anyone that loved the film as much as I did.

3967366,4,B002QEHPQA,"I am an avid supporter of Mann's work so I had no expectations with PE of there being a crystal clear Blu (the cameras he uses) or articulate/perfect sound mixes that allow you to crank it up and still hear dialogue during action scenes. So in fairly rating the BD that detraction list all comes true here, but I still enjoyed the incredible attention to prop detail and filming locations - both of which get covered adequately in the special features.

The picture quality is standard to good as those cameras create the night blur/drag (similar to Miami Vice) but some of the outdoor scenes are clear enough to even see the lens/shutter change (reference the outdoor shot of the jail as Dillinger is driving/escaping - you can actually watch the camera operator change the filter from dull to sharp). The sound is mixed differently throughout depending on the location so some scenes are clear if the camera is pointing right at the speaker, but most do not allow you to have the volume set higher as the gun play is over-amped and/or loud scenes drown the dialogue (airplane, cars, guns, etc.). I still loved watching the performances and I already had read how historically inaccurate the story was but the other details made it a good film to watch - especially since they filmed in so many of the actual locations that the events occurred. Supplements are enjoyable and include:

* 20:32 minute making-of. Mann centers the interviews and flow of the documentary and includes some thorough depictions of how some scenes were made and character preparation.
* 8:44 minute Last Outlaw. Gives a brief history of how these guys were considered to be the last outlaws and covers the actual last moments of Dillinger's life.
* 9:48 minute Locations. Shows all of the work put into filming at the three main historical locations of the story (Bohemian Lodge, the theater and the prison). Shows what can be done if you have enough money to do it right.
* 9:39 minute Criminal Technology. Describes how/why Dillinger had the cars and guns that outperformed the police. Also shows how the FBI started to use more technology to fight these criminals. Some history about Winstead and his role in the shooting (references using outside law help to end Dillinger).
* Commentary with Mann. I always enjoy listening to his theory on attention to detail and what it takes for him to make a film - granted not for everyone.
* DBox - did not use it.
* U-Control. Allows for using the PiP function and incorporating time lines while you watch.
* BD Live. Did the Gangster Movie Challenge, it scrolls through multiple choice options of different movie trivia; had not watched American Gangster recently so I sucked and gave up but you should be able to get all of the PE questions. It does keep track and your score can be compared against other users.

The menu is the standard Universal left-feeding live background action menu (good scenes, good music) but there are more options this time around to help facilitate BD Live stuff (two different icons for that) and learning about how to use everything on the BD (another icon for that). Plus a live feed (similar to a news feed) stays on the upper right quadrant of the menu screen that gives updates on BD live events and other movie stuff.

Overall, a good product for fans of the film and those with a network connection.",1260057600,20,3361,4.710884353741497
3967367,5,B002QEHPQA,"PUBLIC ENEMIES is based upon the outstanding book by Bryan Burrough; however, where the book covers the entire crime spree spanning 1933-1934, the film focuses upon John Dillinger.  It bends quite a few facts (Dillinger and Melvin Purvis never actually met, for example) but remains an engrossing Hollywood adaptation of a criminal legend.  Dillinger's portrayal is romanticized a bit too much, as is Purvis (who wasn't exactly the most effective of lawmen), but these are typical Hollywood ad-ons that, let's face it, we were expecting.

The film has a few flaws: the cinematography occasionally borders on amateur (at times, it looks like a PBS re-enactment); but at the same time, the film looks and feels REAL.  It drags a bit in the middle, which isn't entirely forgivable, and it doesn't live up to Michael Mann's magnum opus HEAT...but few films measure up to HEAT, and most films have slow spots.  These are forgivable mistakes.

The reasons to watch this film?  Two, and you saw 'em coming: Johnny Depp and Christian Bale.  Depp is fantastic; he inhabits Dillinger's skin and thrives.  He's stuck with a few cheesy one-liners, but Dillinger delivers them with as much bravado as he can muster.  Bale, who has divulged in a few ego-boosting roles lately (primarily the most recent TERMINATOR flick), actually goes for a supporting role here, proving once again his knack for memorable performances.  Supporting roles by Giovanni Ribisi, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, and others helps craft a well-rounded film.  As for the writing and directing, we've seen better from Mann, but we've seen much worse from the rest of Hollywood's players.  PUBLIC ENEMIES may not be the perfect gangster film, but it's one of the best that's been made to date, and will unarguably go down as a high point in the genre.",1259798400,2,1811,4.996666666666667

3967371,4,B002QEHPQA,"I was very upset that this movie was rated R. I really think that it sunk the film. There was a total of three swear words (if that), the violence was almost cartoonish (Dick Tracy with Warren Beatty was much more violent)and there was certainly no sexual content. But the hand held camera action was kind of unusual even though I know that Michael Mann was going for a natural look and I think they achieved that. Being the huge Johnny Depp fan that I am, it made me sick that while the filming of this movie was going on 11 miles down the road from where I live, I couldn't go meet him but I think he made an awesome Dillinger. He was definitely much more interesting than the real guy. The real Dillinger looked like a scum-bag. Depp gave him some class. I didn't really believe the character of his girlfriend though. The way he treated her, she had no reason to fall for the guy or put her life on the line the way they did. Even their one love scene was so lame, it was difficult to believe in their romance. The character of Billie had was about as charming and believable as a rock-nuthin! Christian Bale, on the other hand, as Melvin Purvis, scared the daylights out of me. He was determined to get Dillinger and I'm sure that is what drove him to madness, Purvis I mean. I also did not like the the beginning of the movie, where he shot down Pretty Boy Floyd like he was a deer. Not cool. All in all, I was O.K. with the film but I'm not so sure that I want to own it. If I want to look at Depp I can always watch one of the three Pirates movies that I own, or Benny and Joon (young Depp) or Sleepy Hollow (again much scarier than this film). I just wish this film had been a little bit better and maybe Oscar worthy. Now, I don't think so. Too bad.",1257984000,2,1759,4.101449275362318

3967373,3,B002QEHPQA,"The 1995 movie ""Heat"" made Michael Mann's movie career, and ever since then he has made movies similar to ""Heat"" in that the two leading characters manage to be both doppelgangers of each other while being a study in contrasts.  That could be said about ""Heat"" (1995), ""The Insider"" (1999), ""Collateral"" (2004), ""Miami Vice"" (2006), and now ""Public Enemies"" (the only exception to this rule is ""Ali"" (2001), which is also Michael Mann's best film since ""Heat"").

In ""Public Enemies,"" Johnny Depp stars as John Dillinger and Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis, the FBI man tasked with hunting down public enemy number one.  There's a lot of moral ambiguity that makes ""Heat"" interesting, but ""Public Enemies"" is very heavy-handed.  Michael Mann asserts that John Dillinger represented American freedom, the lone hero who fights for love, friends, and honor in dark despicable times.  And in the end he's crushed by the social forces arrayed against him:  the dangerously ambitious J. Edgar Hoover who wants to use Dillinger's death to catapult himself into national fame and power, and the darkly powerful Syndicate who, in having reached a compromise with law enforcement to engage in sinisterly quiet racketeering, need to eliminate Dillinger because he is anything but sinisterly quiet.  With his friends all dead and his lover in jail, John Dillinger only hopes for a loud and fast death.

The story is of course Hollywood, and having Johnny Depp star in the lead role assures a sympathetic rendering of the John Dillinger legend.  The real problems are the thinness of the script, the banality of the characters, and the entire pointlessness of the endeavor.  ""Heat"" was its own internal world, and that world was vast, striking, and knowable; ""Public Enemies"" involves both an era and a nation and so promises to offer a much larger world, but instead it comes across as small-minded and confined.  Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro made an interesting study in contrasts, and their dueling personalities made the movie dynamic and alive.  In ""Public Enemies,"" neither the characters of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale is developed so as to offer the audience an understanding of their personalities and worldview, and thus their duel really doesn't seem to have any purpose except to drive the plot along.

""Public Enemies"" is a pointless waste of time.",1257033600,5,2349,5.07012987012987
3967374,4,B002QEHPQA,"Most of this film works incredibly well. The period piece feel is completely effective, and Johnny Depp is compelling and watchable as Dillinger. I felt Christian Bale's performance was well judged, as he played a man who was a bit of a weasel but it's not how we're used to seeing Bale.

For the rest of the cast, Stephen Graham stands out. The violence and setpieces are well done, some of the best I've seen.

The flaws are in some aspects of the narrative, which flags in places, and that some confusion on minor points can arise. But overall this is good cinema and well worth seeing.
