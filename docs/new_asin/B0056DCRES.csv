8459447,5,B0056DCRES,"The Classic is about a movie between the romantic relationship between a mother,Joo-hae and her daughter,Ji-ha. Both Joo-hae and Ji-hae was played excellently by Korean superstar,Son Ye-jin. It gives the viewer an understanding about the emotions brought about by love,the aspect of how probably fate affects our love relationship and the good and bad feeling of being in love.

The movie was stars as I have mentioned,Son Ye-jin,who was sincere and excellent in her performance as the mother and the daughter. She made her performance interesting that viewers to do care for both her characters. The other cast namely Cho In-Sung and Cho Seung-Woo does not fail to disappoint. It was directed by Kwak Jae-young,who is known for his movies like My Sassy Girl and Windstruck. His direction was just as great as the two movies that I have mentioned.

It ultimately started my love affair with Korean movies and my admiration for Son Ye-jin,one of the best actresses in Asia. Highly recommended for it is not just like any other chick flick out there but a classic one.",1418774400,,1066,4.949720670391062
