2997756,5,B000X3SZLU,"I had the extreme privilege of seeing this show in Las Vegas, and let me tell you, this is a feast for the eyes and ears.  The visuals and dancers bring a fresh wave to Dion's classics. The stage is huge and the background LCD screen in the largest in North America, bringing an intense scenic appeal to Celine's fabulous singing.  The combination of high energy and soft moments all graced with sensational vocals gives you an hour and a half of pure concert entertainment.  They've done a fantastic, high quality job of capturing the energy and unique experience the show offers live. Dion does not disappoint, it's a  MUST SEE!",1196467200,15,630,4.648648648648648
2997757,5,B000X3SZLU,"I got to see her perform in Las Vegas January of 2007, and she was absolutely amazing.  When she performs, she owns the stage.  She is by far the best female vocalist and performer I will ever have the privelage of seeing.  If you didn't get to see her live in Las Vegas, you have to buy this dvd.

2997768,2,B000X3SZLU,"Saw fantastic reviews and had to place an order. The first set of dvds did not run on my blu ray player. I am returning it and yet waiting for a pickup.
The second set arrived and after watching it I was sure I didn't want to see the show live. Celine Dion is too graceful for a Vegas show of this type. the choreography is way out and does not add to her performance. She, herself needs to watch her shows critically. Some of her demeanors and movements deduct from her image. I regard her as a tasteful, serene entertainer and not necessarily wild and rough. But it is Vegas and I am sure the ""popular"" taste was taken into consideration to maximize the sales.
I wish I had designed her show. I would have added grace and glory she deserved.",1503878400,,743,4.23943661971831

2997839,5,B000X3SZLU,"The Theatre at 'Caesars Palace' the 'Colosseum' was rebuilt to AccomIdate 'Celine's'
new show 'A NEW DAY' in 2007.
Watching this again brought back memories of being at the venue for 'Celine's' opening
night in August 2013 which was in part a showcase for her forthcoming album release
later that year 'Loved Me Back To Life'
She certainly is some performer as this brilliant production certainly portrays, her vocal
excellence truly is as seen on this production.
She has year on year performed in front of a packed house at the 'Vegas' venue.
She sings several of her best known numbers during the show including -'The Power of
Love' 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now' 'I Drove All Night' and of course the song she
at first turned down - 'My Heart Will Go On' ( Not a dry eye in the house) she also sings
three of 'Ol Blue Eyes' Frank Sinatra's' numbers, along with plenty more.
She truly is a 'Class -Act' and as this production shows you, A GREAT PERFORMER'
If you love the music this is an essential addition to your collection.
Track List.
'A New Day Has Come' 'The Power of Love' 'It's All Coming Back to Me Now' 'Because
You Loved Me' 'I'm Alive' 'I Drove All Night' 'Seduces Me' 'If I Could' 'Pour Que Tu
M'Aimes Encore' 'I Surrender' 'Ammore Annascunnuto' 'All the Way' 'Iv'e Got the World
On a String' 'I Wish' 'Love Can Move Mountains' 'River Deep, Mountain High' and of
course - 'My Heart Will Go On'
An Amazing Show.

This DVD set is wonderful because it not only lets you see the show as though you were sitting in the audience in Vegas (although it's edited like a music video ... very choppy), then takes you behind the scenes to see backstage and technical highlights of putting on a multi-million dollar Vegas spectacular.

If you're a true Celine Dion fan, this is a must have.

The performance is excellent, the dancers divine but the Blu-ray HD DVD quality takes music and video to a new level, this video will change the way people enjoy vegas shows that reach new highs.

Its been a couple of years since Celine performed live this show, but every time I see this music video I am back at Caesars living the dream. The quality of this recording is superb, musicians who see this show can't help thinking they need a new A game. HD Music Videos from the best ""Celine A New Day.

It is beyond amazing. I wouldn't have considered myself a diehard celine dion fan prior to this but she reeled me in. It is a sight to behold.

This may be a 5 star but I don't think it's that perfect because live music is never as good as studio versions, however this concert is very well recorded, unlike other concerts i've heard on surround, this one has the voice on the center and the instruments on the rest so background music comes from the back speakers and so on. that's a very good thing to enyou music because most of the concerts in surroud they only have the surround channels to play the echoes of the venue, who wants that?

2997958,3,B000X3SZLU,"Celine Dion does herself proud on the Las Vegas strip but...

imho the damper was the surprisingly disappointing choreography by Mia Michaels of ""So You Think You Can Dance"" fame.  Taking tips from the utilization of dancers at a Lady Gaga, Madonna or Cher live concert would have worked wonders for this show.  If Mia had drastically cut the number of dancers and punted more their dancing skills (and highlighted these during Celine's singing) the whoa impact of the show would have taken it several notches up.  Was the thought there that diverting attention from the star of the show might just have diminished its impact?  The winner of SYTYCD Season 2 won the opportunity to dance on Celine Dion's show.  I am now not at all surprised that he turned the offer down.  Guess he must have figured that just running across or around a Las Vegas stage wasn't going to do anything to highlight the wonderful talent that he had or advance his career.

Otherwise a sterling DVD concert...figure it has to be since it ran for more than 5 years.",1321056000,,1041,4.6502732240437155

2997960,5,B000X3SZLU,"This 2 DVD set contain 4 features:

The Concert
A $300 million production that sees Celine performing in this 4000 seater theatre specially built for the show.

Unlike Taking Chances which was staged in a humongous stadium, A New Day Live In Las Vegas is a more intimate show with plenty of performers flying through mid air, dazzling props and sets and Celine shows off some nifty footwork. The breezy 90 minute set shares some similarities with Taking Chances Tour. It has the medley of It's All Coming Back To Me Now/Because You Loved Me/To Love You More and closes with Love Can Move Mountains, River Deep Mountain High and Mt Heart Will Go On. The set list have to keep with the stipulated duration, so only a few songs from her albums A New Day Has Come and One Heart are performed.

As much as the visual aspect is important, it cannot replace Celine's genuine enthusiasm, her zest and the way she touches the audiences with her heartfelt performances. Just look at how many of them cry during her show.

This production will give the other queens of the concert extravaganza namely Cher, Kylie and Madonna a run for the money.

Bonus Feature:
Because You Loved Me A Tribute To The Fans

I really liked this as it interviews fans around the world who fly in to see the show. It details their thoughts before meeting her, their journey to Las Vegas and the touching moments during the meet-and-greet.

Special Feature:
A New Day All Access.

Basically a backstage pass. The sound volume for this feature is somewhat softer. It shows Celine travelling to the venue, doing sound checks, the dancers getting excited etc. During the concert, the feature splits into two screens. One showing Celine onstage and another detailing what actually happens backstage. You see the technical aspects, like how the performers are fitted with harnesses in order to fly. They managed to sneak in some peek-a-boo shots of Celine changing.

Bonus Feature:
A New Day: The Secrets.

The show was taped with Celine with short blonde hair. Unfortunately, they had to throw it out as the fans did not like it. But they saved some footage of her flying through the six storey theatre singing The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face which is not on the concert feature. There are plenty of insights from cast and crew to make this one a must watch as the show is not as easy as it looks.

The Packaging
That's the only beef I have. It's very difficult to remove the discs as you have to slide them carefully out from the holder. Sony could use the conventional type for future pressings.

A New Day is really a great package which explains why it has gone triple diamond in Canada and multi-platinum in many countries.",1318809600,,2695,4.626834381551363

Celine has an amazing voice and can really capture her audience.  With the beautiful, ""A New Day Has Come"" to the finale of her biggest hit, ""My Heart Will Go On"" from Titanic, Celine Dion gives quite an amazing show and will leave you speechless and wanting to hear more! Even if your not a huge Celine fan, You will enjoy it! As a straight, male Celine Dion fan, I really found her show to give me goosebumps as I heard some of her songs.  Unfortunately I was not able to see her show at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas during the 5 year run of ""A New Day..."" but I will for sure after this concert, be seeing her next year when Celine returns to The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.  5 Stars, Watch this concert, you will be glad you did...",1293235200,,911,4.212643678160919

To see the concert then see the same concert from her perspective, backstage is truly a leaning experience.

2997984,3,B000X3SZLU,"The DVD version is fine, but with the Blu Ray they forgot to make a subtitle track for the documentaries that show subtitles when English is not being spoken.  A default subtitle track is supposed to be set for movies and bonus features where non-English is spoken among English.  This way you only see subtitles on the screen when someone is not speaking English.  Since they screwed that up here, you have to manually set the caption for English every time someone speaks other (which on this program is very frequently)  Either that or you have to leave the subtitles on the whole time which is distracting.  This screw-up is almost as bad as rereleasing ""Waterworld"" for Bluray and DVD but only putting the extended version on the DVD.  If they want people to take bluray seriously as the new home video standard, they need to quit screwing around.  Celine's show is great though.",1263513600,2,884,4.701298701298701
2997985,5,B000X3SZLU,"That's me. Never heard of, nor saw, the featured performer. Nevertheless I would say to others like me, even if you immediately hate Celine Dion, you will find much of entertainment value in this arena, which seems to have every dream device that Jerry Lewis might have thought to surround himself. That you will hate Dion is quite unlikely. She is surrounded by dancers, acrobats, singers, and every sort of fireworks imaginable, yet she manages to hold center stage quite easily with strong vocal performances of songs with which the audience, if not you and I, seem quite at home. She looks good, handles herself well, is personable. Multifariously costumed as well. What more can you ask....except, perhaps, Ol' Blue Eyes, with whose image and voice she does a duet.",1261958400,,770,4.930769230769231

The general dancing is SO FREkKKkKKKiiiIIiING amazing ( I am jumping on my sofa so great it is). The choreography is very, very delicate an in place and nicely, masterfully, pleasure to watch, done. The direction is so outstanding so no matter how much he was payed it wouldn't be enough.

Celine here is great! I mean GREAT!

It must be watched with great acoustics. I have nice quality full size speakers JBL L890 with HK3490, and the sound is to be heard to be believed. It is just like  be there personally.

This would be a great souvenir if you went to see the show live and a wonderful performance to watch and listen to if you weren't able to see her in Vegas. I recommend you buy the two-disc DVD set---the special features are outstanding since after you watch her live show you can then watch from backstage as they are doing the show and then watch the interviews including footage of Celine at home with her son and husband. Her voice is amazing and the selection of songs for her final year of shows is great. I suggest you Google Celine Dion and her ""A New Day"" DVD and see and hear a sample of the show, esp. ""River Deep, Mountain High"" if you haven't seen her perform this song the way she did it in Vegas. Note: although the song was written by Phil Spector for Tina Turner, Celine's rendition is so much sexier and polished than Tina's recording of the song.

As to why I only gave this DVD four stars definitely isn't because of Celine!  It's the French version of what is art. The two French-inspired dummies on stage at all times really distracts from Celine's performance.  The bald headed chalky white French mime is completely out of context to Celine's performance, and he seems to lumber into just about every song. The Phillip Morris-styled mime also adds absolutely nothing to the concert except to detract from it.  The choreography is, of course, also French, and has no recognizable relation to the songs Celine is singing.  Maybe I'm just being a typical American who isn't 'contennetial' enough to appreciate the French art, but afterall, it's in Las Vegas and not France. I would still buy this DVD to see and hear Celine.  The visuals and music quality is impeccable as is Celine's wonderful voice.

I play guitar, have season tix to the Comcast Center, so I know a lot about music.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I run my own high tech company north of Boston and don't have a boss so I can get away with this: I took a day off last week, made a TON OF POPCORN, and WATCHED THIS DVD over and over again.

2998033,1,B000X3SZLU,"First of all, I am (well, was) a big big Celine Dion Fan.
The reason why I am giving this DVD a low rating is that fact (not an assumption, fact) that Celine Dion is lipsynching a significant part of her show (also on her current ""Taking chances""-tour).
Lipsynched are:

- The power of love (after the first verse which is live)
- Its all coming back to me now
- The power of love
- I drove all night
- River deep mountain high
- My heart will go on

The whole issue starts to come out, a belgium newspaper had that ""scandal"" in their news lately, they also let some experts listen to the tapes, and they said that it is impossible for any singer to sing a song with the exact same timing (broken down to the second), exact same high notes every time, over and over again.
This is being discussed heavily on a lot of internet forums, people show ""proof-videos"" where they put so-called ""live""-perfomances from Celine next to each other.

Though Las Vegas is considered as a big success for Celine - at least financially - I don't think it was a good step for her artistical direction.
Singing the same songs over and over again, five times a week, in the same old arrangements, partly even playback, didn't do Celines artistical appearance any favour.
And this direction is being continued during her current tour.

I give this DVD one star as people pay a fortune to hear Celine LIVE, not old prerecorded tracks.

In my humble opinion she is not a great live performer in this kind of big production setting.  Buy as many of her CD's as you can.  You cannot take that from her, she has a great voice.

I have a Playstation 3.  The only negative surprise was that it was recorded at 1080i instead of 1080p.  In spite of that, from a technical point of view, I thought the video was razor sharp, the colors were dazzling and the audio was second to none - with true, distinct sound separation.  My surround system is not expensive, but this recording made it seem like it was top of the line!  The second portion of Disk 1 was an excellent tribute to the fans. This is an opportunity to see Celine interacting with her fans. Clearly, what you see is what you get.  She's the real deal and down to earth - no pretending here.  The second disk reveals all the ""behind the scenes"" work (and the number of people involved) it took to bring this concert to life. It's quite an undertaking.

2998067,5,B000X3SZLU,"The Movie Itself: Our Reviewer's Take

Celine Dion is the one musical artist on this planet that I love to hate more than any other. For me, her multi-octave voice, while technically impressive, is the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard. Add to that her zillion-selling albums stuffed with Ready Whip-tunes by songwriters-for-hire, and an utter sincerity as a live performer that makes irony seem like a four-letter word, and Dion is a hilarious spectacle to witness. Blissfully unaware of her own cheesiness, and blessed with a stage persona that makes Napoleon Dynamite seem graceful, Celine is about as cool as Barry Manilow, Engelbert Humperdinck, and Lawrence Welk all rolled into one.

Which is of course why I'm always riveted whenever she's on the screen. Watching her perform in 'A New Day... Live in Las Vegas' (a visually breathtaking document of her legendary five-year run at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace) is like watching someone with Tourette Syndrome sing with the voice of a dove. Her routine goes something like this: she makes some bizarre facial expression, launches into a spastic high-kick, then feigns a bit of rock air guitar (Slash, watch out!), before topping it off with a camera-ready pose, legs spread eagle, as if she suddenly needs to take a dump onstage. If only Celine wasn't so damn gracious and sincere about it all (""I want to dedicate this song to all the parents and children of the world!"" she says at one point, which I guess includes everyone on the planet), I'd say she needs to book a one-way ticket to the cuckoo's nest along with Courtney Love.

Luckily, Celine the awkward entertainer is surrounded by such a spectacle of costume, dance, and electronic visuals in 'A New Day...' that she doesn't have to bear all of the burden on her pointy little shoulders. As conceived by Dragone (better known as the ""visionary"" behind the Cirque du Soleil phenomenon), it's such an utterly ludicrous combination of pretentious performance art, bad musical dinner theater, and bland musicianship that it's like a car crash you can't turn away from, but secretly think is half-good. There is talent on display here to be sure, but it's also so absolutely devoid of any hint of self-awareness that the result is grand, grand camp of the highest caliber.

What's so riveting about 'A New Day...' is that since Celine has never been an artist who seems to exhibit any personal direction over her career, every moment of her show -- like every manufactured note on her albums -- is predetermined by a higher power. In this case, it's Dragone, who stages each song like it's some sort of post-apocalyptic battle for Celine's soul.

The ""themes"" of each number are inspired in their insanity. What to make of ""Seduces Me,"" which features a cavalcade of writhing, half-naked male dancers (apparently on unemployment since Madonna's Blonde Ambition tour circa 1990), who look like a bunch of hungry zombies who don't so much want to make love to Celine as eat her? Or the towering ""To Love You More,"" where the projection of Celine's twitchy mug is beamed upon the ginormous LED screen that covers the back of the stage, complete with flames and thundering lighting effects -- it's Celine as Godzilla, and had I been sitting in the audience, I would have feared for my life. Last, but not least, there is of course ""My Heart Will Go On,"" which Dragone re-imagines as some sort of intergalactic mash-up of 'Titanic' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' complete with giant moon backdrop and an Asian version of Kate Winslet floating suspended across the stage in a giant white wedding dress.

All of this is, of course, massively entertaining. Just the sheer size and scope of this thing is impressive, no matter how much you may hate the music. Celine doesn't perform on any mere stage, of course, but on a mammoth platform that looks as if the Mothership from 'Close Encounters' is going to land at any moment. There is also so much going on at any one moment (Giant video screens! A zillion dancers! Enough smoke for a good-sized forest fire! Celine taking a dump!) that it's impossible to be bored. I just enjoyed watching the over-arching visual madness of it all, even if I understood not a lick of its appeal.

My only real reservation with 'A New Day...' is that I'm not sure if it is the best iteration of the Celine's five-year-spanning run at the Colosseum. The production underwent some tinkering over the years, including various setlist changes, and I'm not sure it was improved along the way. The show I saw live about three years ago seemed to flow a bit better, and also had a more fitting final encore than 'My Heart Will Go On' (which, for some odd reason, ends the show on an anti-climactic note here), but no matter, as any Team Celine member will certainly cherish 'Live in Las Vegas' as a vivid document of what just may prove to be her career zenith as a live performer. Whether or not that is a compliment, I'll leave up to you...

The complete tracklist includes: 01. A New Day Has Come / 02. The Power Of Love / 03. It's All Coming Back To Me Now / 04. Because You Loved Me / 05. To Love You More / 06. I'm Alive / 07. I Drove All Night / 08. Seduces Me / 09. If I Could / 10. Pour Que Tu M'Aimes / 11. I Surrender / 12. Ammore Annascunnuto / 13. All The Way / 14. I've Got The World On A String / 15. I Wish / 16. Love Can Move Mountains / 17. River Deep, Mountain High / 18. My Heart Will Go On

 The Video: Sizing Up the Picture

Sony BMG has been the most consistent distributor of music titles on high-def (on either format), and they once again hit it out of the park with 'Celine Dion: A New Day... Live in Las Vegas.' This is a stellar 1080p/VC-1 encode, with the kind of you-are-there, picture perfect quality that screams demo disc.

Captured with multiple HD cameras, the explosion of color, light, and costume that is 'A New Day...' is tailor-made for Blu-ray. Colors are exquisite -- deep, rich, bold and perfectly saturated with no chroma noise or smearing. Blacks are pure and contrast is excellent, resulting in a level of detail and depth that is truly stunning. 'Live in Las Vegas' also excels in terms of shadow delineation, which is always a true test for shot-on-HD live recordings as they often breakdown into fuzziness and artifacts. No such problems here -- this one is a true winner.

Note that my 'New Day' was almost spoiled when I thought I noticed some pixel break-up and noise in some of the large background images. However, I soon realized that as Celine is often framed in front of the gigantic LED screen that flanks the rear of the stage, I was seeing some blockiness in the actually projections themselves, which is not a fault of the transfer. Have no doubt, 'Live in Las Vegas' is a five-star affair through-and-through.

The Audio: Rating the Sound

'Live in Las Vegas' again scores a home run with dual Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround and uncompressed PCM 2.0 Stereo tracks, both at 96kHz/24-bit, and both breathtaking. I swear, when Celine hit (and held) those high notes, there were times I thought my speakers were going to explode.

I really can't pick a favorite between the PCM and TrueHD (despite the lack of 5.1 on the PCM), as both deliver the kind of goose bump-inducing aural experience of only the best high-resolution live music soundtracks. Celine's vocals and the instrumentation have that transparent, utterly palpable sense of realism that makes it seem as if the music is floating around the room and no longer emanating from a set of speakers.

Timbre, attenuation, fidelity and clarity are all simply exquisite. The highs are warm and rich, and even the sharpest notes that Celine hits never sound too brittle (such sterility is a criticism often leveled at her music). Dynamics are also perfectly modulated. Bass is strong and impactful, but not overpowering. As you would expect, Celine's voice is very prominent in the mix, but not at the expense of her backing -- the elements simply flow together perfectly.

If there is any room for complaint, it is that perhaps the mix makes too little use of the rears. However, the crowd at Caesar's Palace is simply a dull, lifeless one -- Celine crowds are hardly the same raucous group you'd find at a Metallica gig -- so this is a front-heavy mix. I'm not going to fault this Blu-ray for that, as it's a Celine show, and this is about as perfect a sonic reproduction of it as I could imagine.

The Supplements: Digging Into the Good Stuff

'Celine Dion: A New Day... Live in Las Vegas' comes to Blu-ray in a package much more impressive than I expected. Housed in a very elegant fold-out keepcase, there is a considerable amount of documentary material here spread over two full Blu-ray discs -- this is no chintzy Blu-ray/DVD combo that you often get with music discs. Add to that a neat 40-page collectible booklet (which includes liner notes and lyrics to all of the songs performed during the show), plus all of the video-based extras presented in full 1080p/VC-1 video, and this is a strong supplemental presentation. (Note: Subtitle options on all of the included documentary material include English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Chinese, Korean, Thai and Portuguese.)

Documentary: ""Tribute to the Fans "" (HD, 41 minutes) - Okay, these people are freaks... but they're nice freaks. The DVD producers behind 'Live in Las Vegas' paid to fly in a cross-section of over two dozen diehard Celine fans from all around the world to one of her shows at Caesar's Palace, and the resulting travelogue is a psychologist's dream. These people act as if they are meeting God herself, but to Dion's credit, she's always gracious, even when confronted by insanity that borders on dangerous obsession. Eeek!

Documentary: ""A New Day: All Access"" (HD, 120 minutes) - A very cool behind-the-scenes look at the entire conception and production of 'A New Day...' I know, I'm using the words ""Celine"" and ""cool"" in the same paragraph, but this is such an utterly thorough, intimate, and well-paced look at the show that I can't imagine any Dion fan being disappointed. Even more unique, it actually presents the entire concert over again -- the doc is paced in ""real time,"" so as the show progresses song-by-song, we are taken beneath the stage and behind the scenes, to see how the ""magic""is created. Even if you hate Celine, you'll likely find ""All Access"" quite fascinating.

Documentary: ""A New Day: The Secrets"" (HD, 53 minutes) - In some ways, I found this perhaps the most insightful of all the docs on the disc, because the sheer magnitude of the production can't help but impress. Here, we learn all about how they did some the legitimately wow-inducing tricks during the show, such as making various dancers fly without the appearance of wires, as well as seamlessly blending the on-set props with the gigantic LED screen behind the stage. Pretty neat.

There are no high-def exclusives.

Final Thoughts

'Celine Dion: A New Day... Live in Las Vegas' is simply critic-proof. If you love Celine, you'll absolutely love this spectacle, and if you hate her, well... you'll probably hate her even more after watching 90 minutes of her earth-shattering warble. This Blu-ray is simply flawless, however. The video, the audio, the extras -- it's a perfect package and a virtual love letter to fans. Team Celine, this Blu-ray is for you!",1209340800,2,11429,4.733031674208145
2998068,3,B000X3SZLU,"I have been to the concert twice. It's Great! Maybe that is why I was so disappointed in the DVD. The music is great, the editing is amateurish at best. The video cuts from one angle to another every one to two seconds. Except when it focuses on Celine, then maybe 5 or 6 seconds. All of the majesty of her dancers is lost in the rapid fire scene cuts. You cannot focus on anything. There is a lot going on on-stage. It is definitely not captured well on the DVD. Great singing, fantastic Celine. Poor editing and video production.

A show created by Dragone with all the implications that he's huge name has makes this DVD a must have. If you are not a Celine's fan after this you will become one.

I have a tape of this show when it opened, and I am pleasantly surprised
that Celine is back to singing --what she does best-- and not being pushed and diluted into dancing which has to take energy away from her voice.

The way the last act--My Heart Will Go On -- was staged was awesome. Very powerful and great bass!

I have not much else to say, except that this being a stupendous show, great DVD recording, beautiful and moving..what else does one need?

I expressed my concerns to Amazon and was amazed with the customer service by agreeing to replace the DVD.  I have since than received the replacement, but was disappointed that the static problem is the on replacement as well.  I am not sure if this is an manufracture error.

Unfortunatly, the DVD is disappointing and I feel ripped off because most of the show is cut out to make it just a concert DVD i.e. it went from a complicated show that had a flow to it to just a bunch of songs one after the other, like any other concert DVD.

Also, the camera never sits still for more than a second. I nearly got sea-sick watching it. It is rapid fire: here's a closeup of Celine...here what it looks like flying over the stage...here are some people in the audience...here is a shot of the show...here what the show looks like from the worst seat in the house..now we are flying backwards over the audiance...here is the back of Celines head...here are more people in the audiance... and on and on.

I really enjoyed it.  Another of the features is a salute to the fans.  It kind of sucked, but it doesn't take away from the other positives.

2998120,3,B000X3SZLU,"Well, this is a great live show, but I'm not sure how happy I am with the dvd. The big problem I have is the oboard action of the filming. The show itself is a huge spectacle, which would benefit from lots of long, slow-moving shots that allow the viewer to take in what is happening on stage. Instead, the footage is chopped and slightly erratic. There come points where, between the action on stage and the rapid flurries of changing camera shots, the whole thing becomes a dizzying blur.

I was actually on the film crew for the making of this dvd, and having seen the show live 4 times during that process, I can attest to the fact that this dvd fails to capture the true artistry onstage.

The problem is that the whole thing is edited as though it were a standard concert, with nothing but immobile musicians to view, where active angle changes are needed to keep things interesting to watch. This is not an ordinary concert setting, though. The importance of capturing the huge stage show seems to be lost in the shuffle, with the film being creative right over top of the show's creativity, forming a muddled mess which, while still eye grabbing (and great sounding) really fails to capture the impact of the show in the way it could have.",1201996800,60,1247,4.488986784140969

2998133,5,B000X3SZLU,"Wow! This DVD blew me away.  It is really well done -- high quality video and sound.  Play this DVD with a good 5.1 stereo system and HDMI player and it is superb.

Of course, Celine is amazing as always. I would agree that her energy level is a bit lacking, but what can one expect after 4 years of doing (nearly) the same show over and over?  Actually, I didn't become a die-hard fan until AFTER I saw her show live in Las Vegas -- hearing her sing live is truly amazing.

Too bad Je T'aime Encore is not included on here, but I'm glad she at least sings the title song in the program because she didn't the two times I saw her live. I like the change to Frank Sinatra covers and my new favorite is her cover of Tina Turner's ""River Deep, Mountain High"" -- it just looks so effortless for her!  And wow, I never really thought of her as sexy, but she really holds her own in that Tina cover.

Definitely get this DVD even if you went to her concert, it's a great souvenir. And definitely get this DVD if you missed the chance to see her live in Las Vegas.  It's like bringing the concert to your home and having front row seats (and saving a $100 bucks or more).  Unfortunately, I had to pay double to get the DVD European version.  However, it was worth it anyway.  So it is a great deal at $16.99 on Amazon (at time of writing) and I am sure you will watch it over and over.  It's worth it! I already bought tix to her World Tour and hope she finds a way to even surpass her Las Vegas performances! This DVD is a must buy for all Celine fans!",1200614400,,1546,4.032786885245901

No wonder she connects so well with her devoted fans.  Her performance is breath-taking, as is the staging of the songs.  Some are better than others, but overall she absolutely owns this stage.  The extra DVD of Celine and the show cast and crew behind the scenes and of her visiting with some of her fans that have traveled across the globe to see her really brings home that she is indeed a ""person"" and not just a ""personality"".

2998147,5,B000X3SZLU,"That Celine Dion is one of the most generous and sincere artists in music today is pretty well-known.  While she has taken a beating from the media and from detractors for being over-the-top in some of her vocals, a bit too dorky in her performances and in interviews, she has remained (sans the chest-beating) true to herself and to the music and fans that made her famous.

This DVD set is not only for those who saw the show and want a copy of it to remember, or for those who didn't get to see it and wanted to, but it really feels first and foremost like a gift to her die-hard fans.  Most others wouldn't care for the extended amount of footage (over 3 hours worth) dedicated to the trivia about the show, its creation, execution and evolution over the past four years.

I did see the show twice in 2003, and feel that the DVD does a wonderful job of recreating the experience, but if you didn't get to Vegas and sit in the theater that was specifically built for this show, it's not the same.

A couple of other differences for those who saw the show: Nature Boy was omitted as the opening and swapped out for the more appropriate ""A New Day Has Come"" .. I always thought it was odd that the title song from the show was not sung back in 2003.  Also removed is the tacky and ill-fitting cover of ""Fever"", but added in are ""Love Can Move Mountains"" (one of my favorites of hers of all time) and ""River Deep, Mountain High"" in full Tina Turner Tribute mode.

I do regret the omission of two of my personal favorite songs from the shows I saw in 2003 - Je'taime Encore (I Love You Still), one of her most haunting French-language songs she's ever recorded, and the show-ending ""What a Wonderful World"" that, as she sang it, had black and white photos of people from the audience on the giant LCD screen behind her.  It was a touching and intimate way to end a very theatrical production.  You CAN, however, get both of the audio recordings of these two songs on the live CD of the show that was released a few years back.

The fan tribute on here, while often cheesy, is also an endearing look at some of her biggest fans.  That Celine was gracious and kind as she met personally with them all, moved to tears by some of their personal 'thank you's to her, underscores the grace and humility that accompanies the great gift of song she received.",1199491200,89,2349,4.328018223234624

We saw the show when she was blonde and but other than the hair, the show was mesmerizing.  On DVD it is even more riviting because of the close-ups and smooth transitions.  I will cherish this DVD for years to come.  I think she has the most beautiful voice of our generation.  She's in complete control of her music at all times.  Never a faulty note or misstep.  I really do get chills when I hear her sing.  I know many of you didn't care for her new album, Taking Chances, but I think it, too, is stunning.  She's different on some of the songs, but so what.  She's versitile. To those of you who don't like this concert, get over it.  We true fans are thrilled.

2998153,3,B000X3SZLU,"I was really excited to receive this 2 disc DVD for Christmas as I am an avid lover of Celine and I saw her show in Las Vegas twice before it closed. I must say that I was disappointed in the Concert portion of the DVD, not because of quality, but because I saw the show in 2003 and 2005 and found those 2 shows to be much better than this final product. The song choices, the costumes, her energy... all were much more pleasing to me in the conception of this production. The one added plus to this concert is River Deep, Mountain High. Aside from that, so much of Franco Dragone's original concept was not nearly as effective as when it opened.
All in all, very enjoyable... I'm just glad I saw the performance's back when they were sensational.
I could have done without the backstage stuff... yes, it's fun to see some of it... but it's no big deal. Quite honestly, too much of the beginning in her limo and dressing room makes her out to be one big diva with an attitude she can do without.",1198627200,7,995,4.242105263157895
2998154,5,B000X3SZLU,"I was pleasantly surprised by just how much content is loaded on this two disk DVD package. Not only do you get the complete concert but you get three other bonus features that are all about or over an hour long.

First, the concert. I've seen it twice in Vegas. This one was pretty good although, to me, she seemed a little tired during some of the performances. ""I'm Alive"" in particular wasn't very good. She pretty much doesn't care how ""Love Can Move Mountains"" turns out anymore. She just goes out there and sings whatever. But there are two fantastic performances and those are the Italian song and ""River Deep.""

The bonus features start with a ""Tribute to the Fans"" which is touching and also a little creepy. Some of the stories are heart warming and others make the people look a bit sad. One woman says she's had two miracles in her life and one is beating cancer and the other is meeting Celine. I mean...she's had NOTHING else happen in her life more important than meeting a celebrity? And the people that got Celine tattooed on their bodies need some kind of therapy. I think even Celine was creeped out by that.

Another bonus feature is the complete concert but back stage and it is absoutely fascinating what goes on back there and just how much energy is put in to putting on each show every day. The dancers all work extremely hard and Celine is running around non stop and never gets a break. The time she's off stage is spent rushing to put on the next dress. And you almost get to see a naked Celine in this.

The last feature is an hour of interviews with everybody who put the show together and everything that happened. Celine talks about her ugly blonde hair period. They also show some of the performance of the night when she lost her dad.

Great DVD. A must buy for any Celine fan.",1198540800,7,1812,4.413173652694611
2998155,4,B000X3SZLU,"I was one of the many fans who didn't have the time or money to go to Vegas to see Celine live. It is one of those regrets you keep with you on your short list of nagging regrets that would have made your life a bit richer. It caught me off guard the power her voice and presentation has touched this mans heart but you don't have any control of such things.
  I ordered the two disk set and waited for my ""Christmas Gift"" to me to arrive and boy it blew me away.  I would go into the way the DVD is shot and the way the Director framed his shots but it isn't about that is is about the way Celine's power as a performer jumps off the screen and goes like a laser to your heart.
  The song selection is fantasic and even the more abreviated past hits get a fuller treatment then other concert performers allow for those songs that we all grow to love.  I was impressed most of all with the  both the vocals and stage performace of the dancers for ""I Surrender"". and to a lesser extent to the fun loving pace of ""I Drove All Night"". They would serve well as stand alone Videos.  And what can I say about ""My Heart Will Go On"" that hasn't been said by other reviewers.
  The extras are very welcome and add a warm side dish to the feast that this set is to the true Celine fan.  I especialy enjoyed the behind the scene features on the second disk.  I can tell you even if your not a rabid fan this would be a great addition to your concert DVD collection. and the price is very affordable for all you get.",1198195200,4,1504,4.010067114093959
2998156,5,B000X3SZLU,"I had the great honor of attending a full dress rehearsal of A New Day a week before the show opened - 7th row center. This was actually the performance that was televised (in part) on opening night, March 27th 2003.  It was nothing short of AMAZING!!!  Being a full dress rehearsal where the show producers were still deciding which acts would stay and which acts would have to be cut due to time constraints of the actual show we were treated to a much longer version with acts that have never been done for the general public.  What a rare gift!

I also had opening night tickets for myself and my family. Again AMAZING.  Living in Las Vegas, I've had the pleasure of seeing the show three more times since then (a total of 5 times over the past 5 years).  The last show I saw was December 8th, 2007 - closing week. Each of the five shows has been a bit different with different costumes and different staging for most of the numbers.  And each show has been wonderful- so full of energy, heart and immense talent!  As I watch the DVD, I can tell by the costumes that the show was videotaped sometime in the past year so it's very current.

With that background, I can tell you without hesitation, this DVD set is INCREDIBLE!  While obviously not the same as being in the audience, they producers have done a wonderful job of capturing the total show and the impact of it all.  It would be impossible to capture everything that's happening on stage, all of the dancers, the ""sets"", the cinematography on the GIGANTIC LCD screen in the background, the flying instruments ... there is so much happening on and above the huge stage that a camera is incapable of completely capturing it all.  However, the director, cameramen and technicians have done a remarkable job of capturing as much as humanly possible and bringing the at-home audience a BETTER THAN first rate experience.

The ""extras"" on the DVD are wonderful as well.  The viewer is taken on a limo ride with Celine and Renee, from their home in Lake Las Vegas to the theatre and the dressing room.  You have an intimate look at what goes into preparing for the show and what goes on back stage.  While our Star is on stage singing her heart out, you have a look at the other performers as they prepare for their roles.  It's a very interesting and enjoyable look into the reality of the production and see the dedication, talent and pure heart of all involved!

More bonus features take you back to the beginning - from inspiration to creation.  You hear from Franco Dragone.  You learn about the auditions of the cast.  You get a glimpse of Celine meeting her cast members for the first time.  Watch as the theatre is built and the show evolves from inspiration to actualization.  And so much more.  Very interesting and even inspirational.

I absolutely LOVE this DVD set and highly recommend it!  If you've never had the thrill of attending this show, you owe it to yourself to experience it through the DVD.  If you have had the privilege of seeing the show, you'll love reliving the experience over and over again as well as watching the bonus features.  STANDING OVATION for this DVD set... BRAVO - WELL DONE!",1198195200,15,3176,4.524561403508772
2998157,4,B000X3SZLU,"Celine Dion recently closed her 5 year stint in Las Vegas. My friend saw the concert (140 dollars for cheap seats) and loved the show.  I bought the DVD as a Christmas present for her so Patty will remember Celine's  A NEW DAY forever. 5 hours of Celine for 16 dollars is a pretty good deal...

They couldn't of done a better DVD than this. You don't even have to be a Celine Dion fan to enjoy the details in her performances- but if you are be prepared to watch it over and over... :-) :-) :-),1197763200,2,535,4.009345794392523

For those of you who missed out on the concerts, while not the same as seeing it live, this DVD comes as close as you can get to actually being there.  I loved all the extras too.  The set list I saw in 2004 was changed several times throughout the five year run.  The producers of this DVD were smart to include all the songs she performed during her tenure at Caesar's.  I also loved seeing the ""behind the scenes"" too, and not some 10 minute snippet either.  The producers of this DVD went far beyond expectations.  The behind the scenes footage is over 50 minutes!  This is a well put together DVD.  You will not be disappointed.",1197590400,5,719,4.266666666666667

Celine is ""SECOND TO NONE""  when it comes to a perfect voice, showmanship and special effects.  She is the absolute best!

2998163,5,B000X3SZLU,"I saw this concert in Las Vegas in September, 2007 and enjoyed watching this DVD just as much as, if not more than, watching the live concert itself.  This DVD comes very close to replicating both the visual and audio impact of the actual concert.

Celine Dion gives a super performance, but the concert is much more than just the vocals - - the songs are woven into an elaborate Las Vegas style stage production.  The concert venue, the Coliseum at Caesar's Palace, was built specifically for this show, which opened in 2003 and closed in December, 2007.  The arena has 4,000 seats placed in a semi circle around an immense stage.  The seats are positioned so that no seat is more than 120 feet from the stage.

The stage production was arranged by Franco Dragone, a Belgian film and theater director.  Before ""A New Day,"" he directed the Las Vegas Cirque De Soleil productions of ""Mystere"" and ""O.""  It is therefore not surprising that dancers perform during virtually every song.  The troupe has about 60 dancers, but they rarely all appear on stage at the same time.  The dancing is accompanied by magnificent stage effects, which feature, among other things, a tree sprouting from the stage; dancers gently dropping from the rafters on swings and other props; a man riding a bicycle into the sky (much as ET did in the movie); dancers floating above the stage in large picture frames; floating dancers pushing floating street lights; and, last but not least, a grand piano complete with a piano player floating above the stage floor.  This DVD does an excellent job of capturing both the dancing and elaborate staging, while not compromising the video of Celine Dion performing.

Celine sings a total of 18 songs.  The set begins with seven of her biggest hits: A New Day Has Come, The Power of Love, It's All Coming Back to Me Now, Because You Loved Me, To Love You More, I'm Alive and I Drove All Night.  She then sings the less familiar ""Seduces Me"" and ""If I Could.""  This is followed by her biggest French language hit ""Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore,"" ""I Surrender,"" and an Italian language song ""Ammore Annascunnuto.""  Following this, she sings two Frank Sinatra songs: ""All The Way"" and ""I've Got the World on a String"" (during which she is accompanied in part by old video of Sinatra singing.)  Next is ""I Wish,"" ""Love Can Move Mountains,"" and ""River Deep, Mountain High.""  The finale is the theme song from Titanic ""My Heart Can Go On.""  Celine's voice is clear and powerful throughout the show and she delivers each song with perfection.

There are several bonus features of interest on the second disk in this DVD set: the first is a behind the scenes rundown of the entire show, starting at the point where Celine leaves her Las Vegas home and is driven in a limo to Caesar's Palace.  The feature follows pre show preparations and, while the concert is in progress, shows some of the back stage activity including costume changes, performers running to get in the correct position for the next song and a depiction of how dancers and stage props float across the stage and down from the rafters, etc.  The second ""extra"" tells the history of the production, starting with Celine meeting Franco Dragone and the development of the idea of Celine performing a long run engagement in Las Vegas.  It then details a series of significant events, such as designing and building the theater, recruiting and auditioning cast members, and opening night in 2003.  The information is furnished mostly through interviews with Celine, her managers, Dragone, and cast members.

The bottom line is that this is a great concert DVD.  If you enjoy Celine Dion's music, you will not make a mistake buying this one - the performance is mesmerizing.",1197590400,101,3742,4.736111111111111

The second set arrived and after watching it I was sure I didn't want to see the show live. Celine Dion is too graceful for a Vegas show of this type. the choreography is way out and does not add to her performance. She, herself needs to watch her shows critically. Some of her demeanors and movements deduct from her image. I regard her as a tasteful, serene entertainer and not necessarily wild and rough. But it is Vegas and I am sure the ""popular"" taste was taken into consideration to maximize the sales.

3232336,5,B000X3SZLU,"The Theatre at 'Caesars Palace' the 'Colosseum' was rebuilt to AccomIdate 'Celine's'
new show 'A NEW DAY' in 2007.
Watching this again brought back memories of being at the venue for 'Celine's' opening
night in August 2013 which was in part a showcase for her forthcoming album release
later that year 'Loved Me Back To Life'
She certainly is some performer as this brilliant production certainly portrays, her vocal
excellence truly is as seen on this production.
She has year on year performed in front of a packed house at the 'Vegas' venue.
She sings several of her best known numbers during the show including -'The Power of
Love' 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now' 'I Drove All Night' and of course the song she
at first turned down - 'My Heart Will Go On' ( Not a dry eye in the house) she also sings
three of 'Ol Blue Eyes' Frank Sinatra's' numbers, along with plenty more.
She truly is a 'Class -Act' and as this production shows you, A GREAT PERFORMER'
If you love the music this is an essential addition to your collection.
Track List.
'A New Day Has Come' 'The Power of Love' 'It's All Coming Back to Me Now' 'Because
You Loved Me' 'I'm Alive' 'I Drove All Night' 'Seduces Me' 'If I Could' 'Pour Que Tu
M'Aimes Encore' 'I Surrender' 'Ammore Annascunnuto' 'All the Way' 'Iv'e Got the World
On a String' 'I Wish' 'Love Can Move Mountains' 'River Deep, Mountain High' and of
course - 'My Heart Will Go On'
An Amazing Show.

The performance is excellent, the dancers divine but the Blu-ray HD DVD quality takes music and video to a new level, this video will change the way people enjoy vegas shows that reach new highs.

Its been a couple of years since Celine performed live this show, but every time I see this music video I am back at Caesars living the dream. The quality of this recording is superb, musicians who see this show can't help thinking they need a new A game. HD Music Videos from the best ""Celine A New Day.

This may be a 5 star but I don't think it's that perfect because live music is never as good as studio versions, however this concert is very well recorded, unlike other concerts i've heard on surround, this one has the voice on the center and the instruments on the rest so background music comes from the back speakers and so on. that's a very good thing to enyou music because most of the concerts in surroud they only have the surround channels to play the echoes of the venue, who wants that?

3232455,3,B000X3SZLU,"Celine Dion does herself proud on the Las Vegas strip but...

imho the damper was the surprisingly disappointing choreography by Mia Michaels of ""So You Think You Can Dance"" fame.  Taking tips from the utilization of dancers at a Lady Gaga, Madonna or Cher live concert would have worked wonders for this show.  If Mia had drastically cut the number of dancers and punted more their dancing skills (and highlighted these during Celine's singing) the whoa impact of the show would have taken it several notches up.  Was the thought there that diverting attention from the star of the show might just have diminished its impact?  The winner of SYTYCD Season 2 won the opportunity to dance on Celine Dion's show.  I am now not at all surprised that he turned the offer down.  Guess he must have figured that just running across or around a Las Vegas stage wasn't going to do anything to highlight the wonderful talent that he had or advance his career.

Otherwise a sterling DVD concert...figure it has to be since it ran for more than 5 years.",1321056000,,1041,4.6502732240437155

3232457,5,B000X3SZLU,"This 2 DVD set contain 4 features:

The Concert
A $300 million production that sees Celine performing in this 4000 seater theatre specially built for the show.

Unlike Taking Chances which was staged in a humongous stadium, A New Day Live In Las Vegas is a more intimate show with plenty of performers flying through mid air, dazzling props and sets and Celine shows off some nifty footwork. The breezy 90 minute set shares some similarities with Taking Chances Tour. It has the medley of It's All Coming Back To Me Now/Because You Loved Me/To Love You More and closes with Love Can Move Mountains, River Deep Mountain High and Mt Heart Will Go On. The set list have to keep with the stipulated duration, so only a few songs from her albums A New Day Has Come and One Heart are performed.

As much as the visual aspect is important, it cannot replace Celine's genuine enthusiasm, her zest and the way she touches the audiences with her heartfelt performances. Just look at how many of them cry during her show.

This production will give the other queens of the concert extravaganza namely Cher, Kylie and Madonna a run for the money.

Bonus Feature:
Because You Loved Me A Tribute To The Fans

I really liked this as it interviews fans around the world who fly in to see the show. It details their thoughts before meeting her, their journey to Las Vegas and the touching moments during the meet-and-greet.

Special Feature:
A New Day All Access.

Basically a backstage pass. The sound volume for this feature is somewhat softer. It shows Celine travelling to the venue, doing sound checks, the dancers getting excited etc. During the concert, the feature splits into two screens. One showing Celine onstage and another detailing what actually happens backstage. You see the technical aspects, like how the performers are fitted with harnesses in order to fly. They managed to sneak in some peek-a-boo shots of Celine changing.

Bonus Feature:
A New Day: The Secrets.

The show was taped with Celine with short blonde hair. Unfortunately, they had to throw it out as the fans did not like it. But they saved some footage of her flying through the six storey theatre singing The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face which is not on the concert feature. There are plenty of insights from cast and crew to make this one a must watch as the show is not as easy as it looks.

The Packaging
That's the only beef I have. It's very difficult to remove the discs as you have to slide them carefully out from the holder. Sony could use the conventional type for future pressings.

A New Day is really a great package which explains why it has gone triple diamond in Canada and multi-platinum in many countries.",1318809600,,2695,4.626834381551363

With the beautiful, ""A New Day Has Come"" to the finale of her biggest hit, ""My Heart Will Go On"" from Titanic, Celine Dion gives quite an amazing show and will leave you speechless and wanting to hear more! Even if your not a huge Celine fan, You will enjoy it! As a straight, male Celine Dion fan, I really found her show to give me goosebumps as I heard some of her songs.  Unfortunately I was not able to see her show at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas during the 5 year run of ""A New Day..."" but I will for sure after this concert, be seeing her next year when Celine returns to The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.  5 Stars, Watch this concert, you will be glad you did...",1293235200,,911,4.212643678160919

3232481,3,B000X3SZLU,"The DVD version is fine, but with the Blu Ray they forgot to make a subtitle track for the documentaries that show subtitles when English is not being spoken.  A default subtitle track is supposed to be set for movies and bonus features where non-English is spoken among English.  This way you only see subtitles on the screen when someone is not speaking English.  Since they screwed that up here, you have to manually set the caption for English every time someone speaks other (which on this program is very frequently)  Either that or you have to leave the subtitles on the whole time which is distracting.  This screw-up is almost as bad as rereleasing ""Waterworld"" for Bluray and DVD but only putting the extended version on the DVD.  If they want people to take bluray seriously as the new home video standard, they need to quit screwing around.  Celine's show is great though.",1263513600,2,884,4.701298701298701
3232482,5,B000X3SZLU,"That's me. Never heard of, nor saw, the featured performer. Nevertheless I would say to others like me, even if you immediately hate Celine Dion, you will find much of entertainment value in this arena, which seems to have every dream device that Jerry Lewis might have thought to surround himself. That you will hate Dion is quite unlikely. She is surrounded by dancers, acrobats, singers, and every sort of fireworks imaginable, yet she manages to hold center stage quite easily with strong vocal performances of songs with which the audience, if not you and I, seem quite at home. She looks good, handles herself well, is personable. Multifariously costumed as well. What more can you ask....except, perhaps, Ol' Blue Eyes, with whose image and voice she does a duet.",1261958400,,770,4.930769230769231

Celine gives a great show, greatest I ever seen. The visual effects are beyond mere mortal's imagination! The general dancing is SO FREkKKkKKKiiiIIiING amazing ( I am jumping on my sofa so great it is). The choreography is very, very delicate an in place and nicely, masterfully, pleasure to watch, done. The direction is so outstanding so no matter how much he was payed it wouldn't be enough.

Celine here is great! I mean GREAT!

It must be watched with great acoustics. I have nice quality full size speakers JBL L890 with HK3490, and the sound is to be heard to be believed. It is just like  be there personally.

This would be a great souvenir if you went to see the show live and a wonderful performance to watch and listen to if you weren't able to see her in Vegas. I recommend you buy the two-disc DVD set---the special features are outstanding since after you watch her live show you can then watch from backstage as they are doing the show and then watch the interviews including footage of Celine at home with her son and husband. Her voice is amazing and the selection of songs for her final year of shows is great. I suggest you Google Celine Dion and her ""A New Day"" DVD and see and hear a sample of the show, esp. ""River Deep, Mountain High"" if you haven't seen her perform this song the way she did it in Vegas. Note: although the song was written by Phil Spector for Tina Turner, Celine's rendition is so much sexier and polished than Tina's recording of the song.

3232506,4,B000X3SZLU,"I can think of nothing about Celine that hasn't already been said.  Her voice is immaculate, and is the best of anything that has ever been!

As to why I only gave this DVD four stars definitely isn't because of Celine!  It's the French version of what is art. The two French-inspired dummies on stage at all times really distracts from Celine's performance.  The bald headed chalky white French mime is completely out of context to Celine's performance, and he seems to lumber into just about every song. The Phillip Morris-styled mime also adds absolutely nothing to the concert except to detract from it.  The choreography is, of course, also French, and has no recognizable relation to the songs Celine is singing.  Maybe I'm just being a typical American who isn't 'contennetial' enough to appreciate the French art, but afterall, it's in Las Vegas and not France. I would still buy this DVD to see and hear Celine.  The visuals and music quality is impeccable as is Celine's wonderful voice.

Particularly interesting too was the backstage pass (second disc) where you meet the cast as an observer during the production as well as follow Celine throughout the day from her house in the morning and back again at night. This is also a good opportunity to see creative director Franco Dragone's work--he so effectively creates a different world, as someone said, that you enter during the performance.

I play guitar, have season tix to the Comcast Center, so I know a lot about music.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I run my own high tech company north of Boston and don't have a boss so I can get away with this: I took a day off last week, made a TON OF POPCORN, and WATCHED THIS DVD over and over again.

3232530,1,B000X3SZLU,"First of all, I am (well, was) a big big Celine Dion Fan.
The reason why I am giving this DVD a low rating is that fact (not an assumption, fact) that Celine Dion is lipsynching a significant part of her show (also on her current ""Taking chances""-tour).
Lipsynched are:

- The power of love (after the first verse which is live)
- Its all coming back to me now
- The power of love
- I drove all night
- River deep mountain high
- My heart will go on

The whole issue starts to come out, a belgium newspaper had that ""scandal"" in their news lately, they also let some experts listen to the tapes, and they said that it is impossible for any singer to sing a song with the exact same timing (broken down to the second), exact same high notes every time, over and over again.
This is being discussed heavily on a lot of internet forums, people show ""proof-videos"" where they put so-called ""live""-perfomances from Celine next to each other.

Though Las Vegas is considered as a big success for Celine - at least financially - I don't think it was a good step for her artistical direction.
Singing the same songs over and over again, five times a week, in the same old arrangements, partly even playback, didn't do Celines artistical appearance any favour.
And this direction is being continued during her current tour.

I give this DVD one star as people pay a fortune to hear Celine LIVE, not old prerecorded tracks.

But, I was shocked at how stiff and unnatural she was in her own movements and in her interaction with the audience on this disc.  My wife and I actually got uncomfortable watching her.  In my humble opinion she is not a great live performer in this kind of big production setting.  Buy as many of her CD's as you can.  You cannot take that from her, she has a great voice.

This has undoubtedly the highest production values, bar none, than any other live production I have ever seen. The stage that she performs on is a state of the art, computerized marvel of a  masterpiece of science and technology. The performance itself was flawless; afterall they had four years and 700 performances to rehearse. The more I watch this disc, the more I become a Celine Dion fan.  This is the epitome of excellence in live productions.  You cannot go wrong with this one and its well worth the money, and you'll  want to watch it again and again.

I have a Playstation 3.  The only negative surprise was that it was recorded at 1080i instead of 1080p.  In spite of that, from a technical point of view, I thought the video was razor sharp, the colors were dazzling and the audio was second to none - with true, distinct sound separation.  My surround system is not expensive, but this recording made it seem like it was top of the line!  The second portion of Disk 1 was an excellent tribute to the fans. This is an opportunity to see Celine interacting with her fans. Clearly, what you see is what you get.  She's the real deal and down to earth - no pretending here.  The second disk reveals all the ""behind the scenes"" work (and the number of people involved) it took to bring this concert to life. It's quite an undertaking.  No wonder these concerts cost so much!  Definitely worth seeing - but not until you've first seen the concert.  To do so, would only spoil the effects they're trying to achieve.

3232564,5,B000X3SZLU,"The Movie Itself: Our Reviewer's Take

Celine Dion is the one musical artist on this planet that I love to hate more than any other. For me, her multi-octave voice, while technically impressive, is the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard. Add to that her zillion-selling albums stuffed with Ready Whip-tunes by songwriters-for-hire, and an utter sincerity as a live performer that makes irony seem like a four-letter word, and Dion is a hilarious spectacle to witness. Blissfully unaware of her own cheesiness, and blessed with a stage persona that makes Napoleon Dynamite seem graceful, Celine is about as cool as Barry Manilow, Engelbert Humperdinck, and Lawrence Welk all rolled into one.

Which is of course why I'm always riveted whenever she's on the screen. Watching her perform in 'A New Day... Live in Las Vegas' (a visually breathtaking document of her legendary five-year run at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace) is like watching someone with Tourette Syndrome sing with the voice of a dove. Her routine goes something like this: she makes some bizarre facial expression, launches into a spastic high-kick, then feigns a bit of rock air guitar (Slash, watch out!), before topping it off with a camera-ready pose, legs spread eagle, as if she suddenly needs to take a dump onstage. If only Celine wasn't so damn gracious and sincere about it all (""I want to dedicate this song to all the parents and children of the world!"" she says at one point, which I guess includes everyone on the planet), I'd say she needs to book a one-way ticket to the cuckoo's nest along with Courtney Love.

Luckily, Celine the awkward entertainer is surrounded by such a spectacle of costume, dance, and electronic visuals in 'A New Day...' that she doesn't have to bear all of the burden on her pointy little shoulders. As conceived by Dragone (better known as the ""visionary"" behind the Cirque du Soleil phenomenon), it's such an utterly ludicrous combination of pretentious performance art, bad musical dinner theater, and bland musicianship that it's like a car crash you can't turn away from, but secretly think is half-good. There is talent on display here to be sure, but it's also so absolutely devoid of any hint of self-awareness that the result is grand, grand camp of the highest caliber.

What's so riveting about 'A New Day...' is that since Celine has never been an artist who seems to exhibit any personal direction over her career, every moment of her show -- like every manufactured note on her albums -- is predetermined by a higher power. In this case, it's Dragone, who stages each song like it's some sort of post-apocalyptic battle for Celine's soul.

The ""themes"" of each number are inspired in their insanity. What to make of ""Seduces Me,"" which features a cavalcade of writhing, half-naked male dancers (apparently on unemployment since Madonna's Blonde Ambition tour circa 1990), who look like a bunch of hungry zombies who don't so much want to make love to Celine as eat her? Or the towering ""To Love You More,"" where the projection of Celine's twitchy mug is beamed upon the ginormous LED screen that covers the back of the stage, complete with flames and thundering lighting effects -- it's Celine as Godzilla, and had I been sitting in the audience, I would have feared for my life. Last, but not least, there is of course ""My Heart Will Go On,"" which Dragone re-imagines as some sort of intergalactic mash-up of 'Titanic' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' complete with giant moon backdrop and an Asian version of Kate Winslet floating suspended across the stage in a giant white wedding dress.

All of this is, of course, massively entertaining. Just the sheer size and scope of this thing is impressive, no matter how much you may hate the music. Celine doesn't perform on any mere stage, of course, but on a mammoth platform that looks as if the Mothership from 'Close Encounters' is going to land at any moment. There is also so much going on at any one moment (Giant video screens! A zillion dancers! Enough smoke for a good-sized forest fire! Celine taking a dump!) that it's impossible to be bored. I just enjoyed watching the over-arching visual madness of it all, even if I understood not a lick of its appeal.

My only real reservation with 'A New Day...' is that I'm not sure if it is the best iteration of the Celine's five-year-spanning run at the Colosseum. The production underwent some tinkering over the years, including various setlist changes, and I'm not sure it was improved along the way. The show I saw live about three years ago seemed to flow a bit better, and also had a more fitting final encore than 'My Heart Will Go On' (which, for some odd reason, ends the show on an anti-climactic note here), but no matter, as any Team Celine member will certainly cherish 'Live in Las Vegas' as a vivid document of what just may prove to be her career zenith as a live performer. Whether or not that is a compliment, I'll leave up to you...

The complete tracklist includes: 01. A New Day Has Come / 02. The Power Of Love / 03. It's All Coming Back To Me Now / 04. Because You Loved Me / 05. To Love You More / 06. I'm Alive / 07. I Drove All Night / 08. Seduces Me / 09. If I Could / 10. Pour Que Tu M'Aimes / 11. I Surrender / 12. Ammore Annascunnuto / 13. All The Way / 14. I've Got The World On A String / 15. I Wish / 16. Love Can Move Mountains / 17. River Deep, Mountain High / 18. My Heart Will Go On

 The Video: Sizing Up the Picture

Sony BMG has been the most consistent distributor of music titles on high-def (on either format), and they once again hit it out of the park with 'Celine Dion: A New Day... Live in Las Vegas.' This is a stellar 1080p/VC-1 encode, with the kind of you-are-there, picture perfect quality that screams demo disc.

Captured with multiple HD cameras, the explosion of color, light, and costume that is 'A New Day...' is tailor-made for Blu-ray. Colors are exquisite -- deep, rich, bold and perfectly saturated with no chroma noise or smearing. Blacks are pure and contrast is excellent, resulting in a level of detail and depth that is truly stunning. 'Live in Las Vegas' also excels in terms of shadow delineation, which is always a true test for shot-on-HD live recordings as they often breakdown into fuzziness and artifacts. No such problems here -- this one is a true winner.

Note that my 'New Day' was almost spoiled when I thought I noticed some pixel break-up and noise in some of the large background images. However, I soon realized that as Celine is often framed in front of the gigantic LED screen that flanks the rear of the stage, I was seeing some blockiness in the actually projections themselves, which is not a fault of the transfer. Have no doubt, 'Live in Las Vegas' is a five-star affair through-and-through.

The Audio: Rating the Sound

'Live in Las Vegas' again scores a home run with dual Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround and uncompressed PCM 2.0 Stereo tracks, both at 96kHz/24-bit, and both breathtaking. I swear, when Celine hit (and held) those high notes, there were times I thought my speakers were going to explode.

I really can't pick a favorite between the PCM and TrueHD (despite the lack of 5.1 on the PCM), as both deliver the kind of goose bump-inducing aural experience of only the best high-resolution live music soundtracks. Celine's vocals and the instrumentation have that transparent, utterly palpable sense of realism that makes it seem as if the music is floating around the room and no longer emanating from a set of speakers.

Timbre, attenuation, fidelity and clarity are all simply exquisite. The highs are warm and rich, and even the sharpest notes that Celine hits never sound too brittle (such sterility is a criticism often leveled at her music). Dynamics are also perfectly modulated. Bass is strong and impactful, but not overpowering. As you would expect, Celine's voice is very prominent in the mix, but not at the expense of her backing -- the elements simply flow together perfectly.

If there is any room for complaint, it is that perhaps the mix makes too little use of the rears. However, the crowd at Caesar's Palace is simply a dull, lifeless one -- Celine crowds are hardly the same raucous group you'd find at a Metallica gig -- so this is a front-heavy mix. I'm not going to fault this Blu-ray for that, as it's a Celine show, and this is about as perfect a sonic reproduction of it as I could imagine.

The Supplements: Digging Into the Good Stuff

'Celine Dion: A New Day... Live in Las Vegas' comes to Blu-ray in a package much more impressive than I expected. Housed in a very elegant fold-out keepcase, there is a considerable amount of documentary material here spread over two full Blu-ray discs -- this is no chintzy Blu-ray/DVD combo that you often get with music discs. Add to that a neat 40-page collectible booklet (which includes liner notes and lyrics to all of the songs performed during the show), plus all of the video-based extras presented in full 1080p/VC-1 video, and this is a strong supplemental presentation. (Note: Subtitle options on all of the included documentary material include English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Chinese, Korean, Thai and Portuguese.)

Documentary: ""Tribute to the Fans "" (HD, 41 minutes) - Okay, these people are freaks... but they're nice freaks. The DVD producers behind 'Live in Las Vegas' paid to fly in a cross-section of over two dozen diehard Celine fans from all around the world to one of her shows at Caesar's Palace, and the resulting travelogue is a psychologist's dream. These people act as if they are meeting God herself, but to Dion's credit, she's always gracious, even when confronted by insanity that borders on dangerous obsession. Eeek!

Documentary: ""A New Day: All Access"" (HD, 120 minutes) - A very cool behind-the-scenes look at the entire conception and production of 'A New Day...' I know, I'm using the words ""Celine"" and ""cool"" in the same paragraph, but this is such an utterly thorough, intimate, and well-paced look at the show that I can't imagine any Dion fan being disappointed. Even more unique, it actually presents the entire concert over again -- the doc is paced in ""real time,"" so as the show progresses song-by-song, we are taken beneath the stage and behind the scenes, to see how the ""magic""is created. Even if you hate Celine, you'll likely find ""All Access"" quite fascinating.

Documentary: ""A New Day: The Secrets"" (HD, 53 minutes) - In some ways, I found this perhaps the most insightful of all the docs on the disc, because the sheer magnitude of the production can't help but impress. Here, we learn all about how they did some the legitimately wow-inducing tricks during the show, such as making various dancers fly without the appearance of wires, as well as seamlessly blending the on-set props with the gigantic LED screen behind the stage. Pretty neat.

There are no high-def exclusives.

Final Thoughts

'Celine Dion: A New Day... Live in Las Vegas' is simply critic-proof. If you love Celine, you'll absolutely love this spectacle, and if you hate her, well... you'll probably hate her even more after watching 90 minutes of her earth-shattering warble.

I have a tape of this show when it opened, and I am pleasantly surprised
that Celine is back to singing --what she does best-- and not being pushed and diluted into dancing which has to take energy away from her voice.

The way the last act--My Heart Will Go On -- was staged was awesome. Very powerful and great bass!

I have not much else to say, except that this being a stupendous show, great DVD recording, beautiful and moving..what else does one need?

Thanks Celine!",1206403200,2,547,4.29126213592233

Having not being able to attend the concert this would be the next best thing.  However when I received the DVD it was defective with static sound three quarters into the DVD.  I expressed my concerns to Amazon and was amazed with the customer service by agreeing to replace the DVD.  I have since than received the replacement, but was disappointed that the static problem is the on replacement as well.  I am not sure if this is an manufracture error.  I am curious to know if other customers who ordered this DVD expressed this same problem.  Any regards I am at a lost as what to do next.

She sings almost every song you could want to hear again and you get a good idea of the set changes and wonderful dancing in the background.

Unfortunatly, the DVD is disappointing and I feel ripped off because most of the show is cut out to make it just a concert DVD i.e. it went from a complicated show that had a flow to it to just a bunch of songs one after the other, like any other concert DVD.

Also, the camera never sits still for more than a second. I nearly got sea-sick watching it. It is rapid fire: here's a closeup of Celine...here what it looks like flying over the stage...here are some people in the audience...here is a shot of the show...here what the show looks like from the worst seat in the house..now we are flying backwards over the audiance...here is the back of Celines head...here are more people in the audiance... and on and on.

They also seemed to have cut parts of the show out. I know some songs are missing. Also, there were periods where the show continued while she changed and rested that are cut out as well.",1204934400,23,1091,4.240384615384615

The special feature that is on the first of the 2 Blu-ray discs consists of Dion greeting fans in person from all over the world.  On the second disc, thee is a truly stunning special feature is one that runs two hours (longer than the concert on the first disc) and it is the entire Las Vegas show running on stage while we get a backstage view of all the technical and talent sides. Really fascinating!  There is also one more featurette called ""Secrets.""  The special features are in high def, too, on the Blu-ray discs.

The special features are great.  One of the features shows you the entire show from a back stage perspective (starting from when Celine kisses her boy goodbye at home all the way until she returns home after the show.  I really enjoyed it.  Another of the features is a salute to the fans.  It kind of sucked, but it doesn't take away from the other positives.

3232617,3,B000X3SZLU,"Well, this is a great live show, but I'm not sure how happy I am with the dvd. The big problem I have is the oboard action of the filming. The show itself is a huge spectacle, which would benefit from lots of long, slow-moving shots that allow the viewer to take in what is happening on stage. Instead, the footage is chopped and slightly erratic. There come points where, between the action on stage and the rapid flurries of changing camera shots, the whole thing becomes a dizzying blur.

I was actually on the film crew for the making of this dvd, and having seen the show live 4 times during that process, I can attest to the fact that this dvd fails to capture the true artistry onstage.

The problem is that the whole thing is edited as though it were a standard concert, with nothing but immobile musicians to view, where active angle changes are needed to keep things interesting to watch. This is not an ordinary concert setting, though. The importance of capturing the huge stage show seems to be lost in the shuffle, with the film being creative right over top of the show's creativity, forming a muddled mess which, while still eye grabbing (and great sounding) really fails to capture the impact of the show in the way it could have.",1201996800,60,1247,4.488986784140969

3232630,5,B000X3SZLU,"Wow! This DVD blew me away.  It is really well done -- high quality video and sound.  Play this DVD with a good 5.1 stereo system and HDMI player and it is superb.

Of course, Celine is amazing as always. I would agree that her energy level is a bit lacking, but what can one expect after 4 years of doing (nearly) the same show over and over?  Actually, I didn't become a die-hard fan until AFTER I saw her show live in Las Vegas -- hearing her sing live is truly amazing.

Too bad Je T'aime Encore is not included on here, but I'm glad she at least sings the title song in the program because she didn't the two times I saw her live. I like the change to Frank Sinatra covers and my new favorite is her cover of Tina Turner's ""River Deep, Mountain High"" -- it just looks so effortless for her!  And wow, I never really thought of her as sexy, but she really holds her own in that Tina cover.

Definitely get this DVD even if you went to her concert, it's a great souvenir. And definitely get this DVD if you missed the chance to see her live in Las Vegas.  It's like bringing the concert to your home and having front row seats (and saving a $100 bucks or more).  Unfortunately, I had to pay double to get the DVD European version.  However, it was worth it anyway.  So it is a great deal at $16.99 on Amazon (at time of writing) and I am sure you will watch it over and over.  It's worth it!

No wonder she connects so well with her devoted fans.  Her performance is breath-taking, as is the staging of the songs.  Some are better than others, but overall she absolutely owns this stage.  The extra DVD of Celine and the show cast and crew behind the scenes and of her visiting with some of her fans that have traveled across the globe to see her really brings home that she is indeed a ""person"" and not just a ""personality"".

3232644,5,B000X3SZLU,"That Celine Dion is one of the most generous and sincere artists in music today is pretty well-known.  While she has taken a beating from the media and from detractors for being over-the-top in some of her vocals, a bit too dorky in her performances and in interviews, she has remained (sans the chest-beating) true to herself and to the music and fans that made her famous.

This DVD set is not only for those who saw the show and want a copy of it to remember, or for those who didn't get to see it and wanted to, but it really feels first and foremost like a gift to her die-hard fans.  Most others wouldn't care for the extended amount of footage (over 3 hours worth) dedicated to the trivia about the show, its creation, execution and evolution over the past four years.

I did see the show twice in 2003, and feel that the DVD does a wonderful job of recreating the experience, but if you didn't get to Vegas and sit in the theater that was specifically built for this show, it's not the same.

A couple of other differences for those who saw the show: Nature Boy was omitted as the opening and swapped out for the more appropriate ""A New Day Has Come"" .. I always thought it was odd that the title song from the show was not sung back in 2003.  Also removed is the tacky and ill-fitting cover of ""Fever"", but added in are ""Love Can Move Mountains"" (one of my favorites of hers of all time) and ""River Deep, Mountain High"" in full Tina Turner Tribute mode.

I do regret the omission of two of my personal favorite songs from the shows I saw in 2003 - Je'taime Encore (I Love You Still), one of her most haunting French-language songs she's ever recorded, and the show-ending ""What a Wonderful World"" that, as she sang it, had black and white photos of people from the audience on the giant LCD screen behind her.  It was a touching and intimate way to end a very theatrical production.  You CAN, however, get both of the audio recordings of these two songs on the live CD of the show that was released a few years back.

The fan tribute on here, while often cheesy, is also an endearing look at some of her biggest fans.  That Celine was gracious and kind as she met personally with them all, moved to tears by some of their personal 'thank you's to her, underscores the grace and humility that accompanies the great gift of song she received.",1199491200,89,2349,4.328018223234624

3232648,5,B000X3SZLU,"I never made it to Vegas to see Celine's show live so was very pleased they released this on DVD. I enjoy Celine very much but can't say she is my #1 favorite artist. However this DVD absolutely blew me away. I have watched the concert 3 times in the last 3 days! Her voice and performance are great, the dancers are wonderful and visuals are amazing. (That 10 million dollar LED screen WAS worth the money!!) The back-stage feature is really interesting and well done and gives you an idea of the hard work and experience of what it's like to be involved in the production. Definitely worth 2 hours of your time. The other, more interview style, featurette is also informative and very interesting. I have since watched the fan tribute several times and have found it very touching and enjoyable to watch as well.

3232649,5,B000X3SZLU,"I've read many of the reviews and was shocked that anyone who enjoys Celine Dion's voice could write a negative review.  If they don't care for her, why review?  This is the most stunning DVD I've seen to date.  I'm upset it's not yet in Hi Def.  I will buy that when it's released.  I just couldn't wait that long.  We saw the show when she was blonde and but other than the hair, the show was mesmerizing.  On DVD it is even more riviting because of the close-ups and smooth transitions.  I will cherish this DVD for years to come.  I think she has the most beautiful voice of our generation.  She's in complete control of her music at all times.  Never a faulty note or misstep.  I really do get chills when I hear her sing.  I know many of you didn't care for her new album, Taking Chances, but I think it, too, is stunning.  She's different on some of the songs, but so what.  She's versitile. To those of you who don't like this concert, get over it.  We true fans are thrilled.  I can't wait to see her when she comes to my area next year.",1198800000,,1046,4.124378109452737
3232650,3,B000X3SZLU,"I was really excited to receive this 2 disc DVD for Christmas as I am an avid lover of Celine and I saw her show in Las Vegas twice before it closed. I must say that I was disappointed in the Concert portion of the DVD, not because of quality, but because I saw the show in 2003 and 2005 and found those 2 shows to be much better than this final product. The song choices, the costumes, her energy... all were much more pleasing to me in the conception of this production. The one added plus to this concert is River Deep, Mountain High. Aside from that, so much of Franco Dragone's original concept was not nearly as effective as when it opened.
All in all, very enjoyable... I'm just glad I saw the performance's back when they were sensational.
I could have done without the backstage stuff... yes, it's fun to see some of it... but it's no big deal. Quite honestly, too much of the beginning in her limo and dressing room makes her out to be one big diva with an attitude she can do without.",1198627200,7,995,4.242105263157895
3232651,5,B000X3SZLU,"I was pleasantly surprised by just how much content is loaded on this two disk DVD package. Not only do you get the complete concert but you get three other bonus features that are all about or over an hour long.

First, the concert. I've seen it twice in Vegas. This one was pretty good although, to me, she seemed a little tired during some of the performances. ""I'm Alive"" in particular wasn't very good. She pretty much doesn't care how ""Love Can Move Mountains"" turns out anymore. She just goes out there and sings whatever. But there are two fantastic performances and those are the Italian song and ""River Deep.""

The bonus features start with a ""Tribute to the Fans"" which is touching and also a little creepy. Some of the stories are heart warming and others make the people look a bit sad. One woman says she's had two miracles in her life and one is beating cancer and the other is meeting Celine. I mean...she's had NOTHING else happen in her life more important than meeting a celebrity? And the people that got Celine tattooed on their bodies need some kind of therapy. I think even Celine was creeped out by that.

Another bonus feature is the complete concert but back stage and it is absoutely fascinating what goes on back there and just how much energy is put in to putting on each show every day. The dancers all work extremely hard and Celine is running around non stop and never gets a break. The time she's off stage is spent rushing to put on the next dress. And you almost get to see a naked Celine in this.

The last feature is an hour of interviews with everybody who put the show together and everything that happened. Celine talks about her ugly blonde hair period. They also show some of the performance of the night when she lost her dad.

Great DVD. A must buy for any Celine fan.",1198540800,7,1812,4.413173652694611
3232652,4,B000X3SZLU,"I was one of the many fans who didn't have the time or money to go to Vegas to see Celine live. It is one of those regrets you keep with you on your short list of nagging regrets that would have made your life a bit richer. It caught me off guard the power her voice and presentation has touched this mans heart but you don't have any control of such things.
  I ordered the two disk set and waited for my ""Christmas Gift"" to me to arrive and boy it blew me away.  I would go into the way the DVD is shot and the way the Director framed his shots but it isn't about that is is about the way Celine's power as a performer jumps off the screen and goes like a laser to your heart.
  The song selection is fantasic and even the more abreviated past hits get a fuller treatment then other concert performers allow for those songs that we all grow to love.  I was impressed most of all with the  both the vocals and stage performace of the dancers for ""I Surrender"". and to a lesser extent to the fun loving pace of ""I Drove All Night"". They would serve well as stand alone Videos.  And what can I say about ""My Heart Will Go On"" that hasn't been said by other reviewers.
  The extras are very welcome and add a warm side dish to the feast that this set is to the true Celine fan.  I especialy enjoyed the behind the scene features on the second disk.  I can tell you even if your not a rabid fan this would be a great addition to your concert DVD collection. and the price is very affordable for all you get.",1198195200,4,1504,4.010067114093959
3232653,5,B000X3SZLU,"I had the great honor of attending a full dress rehearsal of A New Day a week before the show opened - 7th row center. This was actually the performance that was televised (in part) on opening night, March 27th 2003.  It was nothing short of AMAZING!!!  Being a full dress rehearsal where the show producers were still deciding which acts would stay and which acts would have to be cut due to time constraints of the actual show we were treated to a much longer version with acts that have never been done for the general public.  What a rare gift!

I also had opening night tickets for myself and my family. Again AMAZING.  Living in Las Vegas, I've had the pleasure of seeing the show three more times since then (a total of 5 times over the past 5 years).  The last show I saw was December 8th, 2007 - closing week. Each of the five shows has been a bit different with different costumes and different staging for most of the numbers.  And each show has been wonderful- so full of energy, heart and immense talent!  As I watch the DVD, I can tell by the costumes that the show was videotaped sometime in the past year so it's very current.

With that background, I can tell you without hesitation, this DVD set is INCREDIBLE!  While obviously not the same as being in the audience, they producers have done a wonderful job of capturing the total show and the impact of it all.  It would be impossible to capture everything that's happening on stage, all of the dancers, the ""sets"", the cinematography on the GIGANTIC LCD screen in the background, the flying instruments ... there is so much happening on and above the huge stage that a camera is incapable of completely capturing it all.  However, the director, cameramen and technicians have done a remarkable job of capturing as much as humanly possible and bringing the at-home audience a BETTER THAN first rate experience.

The ""extras"" on the DVD are wonderful as well.  The viewer is taken on a limo ride with Celine and Renee, from their home in Lake Las Vegas to the theatre and the dressing room.  You have an intimate look at what goes into preparing for the show and what goes on back stage.  While our Star is on stage singing her heart out, you have a look at the other performers as they prepare for their roles.  It's a very interesting and enjoyable look into the reality of the production and see the dedication, talent and pure heart of all involved!

More bonus features take you back to the beginning - from inspiration to creation.  You hear from Franco Dragone.  You learn about the auditions of the cast.  You get a glimpse of Celine meeting her cast members for the first time.  Watch as the theatre is built and the show evolves from inspiration to actualization.  And so much more.  Very interesting and even inspirational.

I absolutely LOVE this DVD set and highly recommend it!  If you've never had the thrill of attending this show, you owe it to yourself to experience it through the DVD.  If you have had the privilege of seeing the show, you'll love reliving the experience over and over again as well as watching the bonus features.  STANDING OVATION for this DVD set... BRAVO - WELL DONE!",1198195200,15,3176,4.524561403508772

The set list I saw in 2004 was changed several times throughout the five year run.  The producers of this DVD were smart to include all the songs she performed during her tenure at Caesar's.

3232660,5,B000X3SZLU,"I saw this concert in Las Vegas in September, 2007 and enjoyed watching this DVD just as much as, if not more than, watching the live concert itself.  This DVD comes very close to replicating both the visual and audio impact of the actual concert.

Celine Dion gives a super performance, but the concert is much more than just the vocals - - the songs are woven into an elaborate Las Vegas style stage production.  The concert venue, the Coliseum at Caesar's Palace, was built specifically for this show, which opened in 2003 and closed in December, 2007.  The arena has 4,000 seats placed in a semi circle around an immense stage.  The seats are positioned so that no seat is more than 120 feet from the stage.

The stage production was arranged by Franco Dragone, a Belgian film and theater director.  Before ""A New Day,"" he directed the Las Vegas Cirque De Soleil productions of ""Mystere"" and ""O.""  It is therefore not surprising that dancers perform during virtually every song.  The troupe has about 60 dancers, but they rarely all appear on stage at the same time.  The dancing is accompanied by magnificent stage effects, which feature, among other things, a tree sprouting from the stage; dancers gently dropping from the rafters on swings and other props; a man riding a bicycle into the sky (much as ET did in the movie); dancers floating above the stage in large picture frames; floating dancers pushing floating street lights; and, last but not least, a grand piano complete with a piano player floating above the stage floor.  This DVD does an excellent job of capturing both the dancing and elaborate staging, while not compromising the video of Celine Dion performing.

Celine sings a total of 18 songs.  The set begins with seven of her biggest hits: A New Day Has Come, The Power of Love, It's All Coming Back to Me Now, Because You Loved Me, To Love You More, I'm Alive and I Drove All Night.  She then sings the less familiar ""Seduces Me"" and ""If I Could.""  This is followed by her biggest French language hit ""Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore,"" ""I Surrender,"" and an Italian language song ""Ammore Annascunnuto.""  Following this, she sings two Frank Sinatra songs: ""All The Way"" and ""I've Got the World on a String"" (during which she is accompanied in part by old video of Sinatra singing.)  Next is ""I Wish,"" ""Love Can Move Mountains,"" and ""River Deep, Mountain High.""  The finale is the theme song from Titanic ""My Heart Can Go On.""  Celine's voice is clear and powerful throughout the show and she delivers each song with perfection.

There are several bonus features of interest on the second disk in this DVD set: the first is a behind the scenes rundown of the entire show, starting at the point where Celine leaves her Las Vegas home and is driven in a limo to Caesar's Palace.  The feature follows pre show preparations and, while the concert is in progress, shows some of the back stage activity including costume changes, performers running to get in the correct position for the next song and a depiction of how dancers and stage props float across the stage and down from the rafters, etc.  The second ""extra"" tells the history of the production, starting with Celine meeting Franco Dragone and the development of the idea of Celine performing a long run engagement in Las Vegas.  It then details a series of significant events, such as designing and building the theater, recruiting and auditioning cast members, and opening night in 2003.  The information is furnished mostly through interviews with Celine, her managers, Dragone, and cast members.

The bottom line is that this is a great concert DVD.  If you enjoy Celine Dion's music, you will not make a mistake buying this one - the performance is mesmerizing.",1197590400,101,3742,4.736111111111111
