6817633,3,B00PLYUB8Q,"Not a bad movie at all. In fact, its very well made. However, halfway through, the story seemed to put emphasis less on the main problem and issue of the story (which was the overnighters program) and focus much more on personal problems of the Pastor. I've been reading reviews on this movie for 3 months and was excited to watch it, but after finally seeing it, I found out that many of these reviews are not entirely true to the story. The theme of the story is not so much ""help thy neighbor"", but rather ""the people of Williston ND are unreasonable and unkind to outsiders"".
I enjoyed the movie for the most part until the very end (the ending actually didn't make any sense to me..... but you'd have to watch it to see for yourself.) Jesse Moss did a great job putting it together, but it is not really comparable to the Grapes of Wrath.",1424217600,5,843,4.341772151898734

6817635,5,B00PLYUB8Q,"Good depiction of what has been an ongoing problem in the oil fields of North Dakota. Increased cost of living and housing shortages are a logical consequence of high wage oil field jobs, but it's good to see some attention brought to this issue. As a former ND oil field worker, I can say that my experience wasn't anything like what these people experienced, but I was working more toward the southern edge of the Bakken oilfields where the housing situation wasn't quite as desperate. Until the work dries up or we become less oil dependent, imported workers will continue to flock to North Dakota in search of a better life. It would be nice to see communities such as Williston respond in a more proactive way to the housing shortage, instead of the film's depiction of the town simply trying to make it harder to stay there. That being said, I do understand the town's concerns. Not an easy situation either way. Definitely recommend watching though, especially for anyone who is interested in going out there.",1423267200,2,1016,4.745762711864407

6817639,4,B00PLYUB8Q,"Thousand of desperate employers are moving to North Dakota with the hope to find a job in the oil extract industry. Thats the main plot of The Overnighters, the feature documentary by Jesse Moss, but actually the movie is more focused on capturing the anger and the hostile reaction of the community when the reverend of that town decided to give to that broken poor people, who couldn't find a job, food and a place to sleep. Behind the invisible camera of Moss, the spectator is an exceptional witness of that fight between a man, with principles and ideals, and a disappointed community that is against him and the newcomers. At the same time is a deeper and more brilliant mediation about the meaning of community and about compassion and kindness.

For all these reasons nobody should be surprised if The Overnighters will be selected as one of the documentaries that will race to the Oscars.

Some reviewers compare it to The grapes of Wrath of S. XXI, and I think there is no better way to describe one of the best documentaries of 2014.",1417737600,21,1044,4.6378378378378375

6817676,3,B00PLYUB8Q,"Spoiler Alert!  I will be discussing parts of the whole movie here.

I knew almost nothing of this movie going into it other than documentarian Brett Morgen said he thought it was the best doc of 2014 and that it was mind blowing.  That piqued my interest and, after seeing this movie, blows my mind.

The great thing about a good documentary is that is makes the commonplace compelling.  This one does not.  Though it is interesting, I was confused throughout by 1) why this was the subject of a documentary and 2)why should I care about Pastor Reinke?  It was obvious from almost the beginning that Pastor Reinke was basking in the attention that the camera was giving him.  It was also obvious throughout that many of the scenes in the film were staged but portrayed as capturing a ""real"" moment.  One clunky scene that illustrates both is when Pastor Reinke is shown in his overcoat (winter is coming on) searching through town for one of the ""lost souls"" who has stayed at his church.  He looks in bars, stores, and asks around, all while night is falling.  The good pastor finally finds his friend at the bus station and when the Reinke informs him he had been searching all over town, they guy responds with ""Why didn't you just call me?""  Why indeed?

Another scene that demonstrates Reinke's love of attention, and a scene that makes him even more bizzarre as a protagonist, is when he sees an Amtrak train passing and decides to stop his car, exit his car, and stand on the street waving at it with both arms--just because he likes to wave at trains.  Wait, whaa?

I was also confused by the anti-drilling imagery in the film. One image in particular was especially confusing.  A load of flyash is being placed on a flatbed trailer.  Flyash is a byproduct of burning coal, not in any way related to oil.  It's also evidence of how coal is becoming cleaner and better for the environment, not more destructive. Flyash, which used to be ejected into the atmosphere, is now collected instead and sold as a key ingredient in making better road mixes.  Its use in the film is mystifying.

But back to Reinke.  Another thing that stood out to me about him is that he never has pauses in his speech.  Normally people have an ""um"" or a ""sort of"" or a ""like"" or any other natural speach filler when they are extemporaneously conversing and trying to collect their thoughts.  He never stops talking!  To me this was jarring.  I'm not sure if this is a talent of his or if he had things that well rehearsed before talking.

Finally, his bombshell at the end was only surprising in that it had nothing to do with the rest of the film.  It is unfortunate that the filmmaker would choose to show such an intimate and personally devastating moment in Mrs. Reinke's life.  I will leave it at that so as not to spoil too much of the film for those who haven't seen it.

This film was good in that it shows the reality of an oil boom and the difficulties communities face when an influx of people, desirable and otherwise, overrun their ablilty to accomodate them.",1439683200,5,3056,4.49546279491833

6817678,5,B00PLYUB8Q,"Well the documentary is pretty darn good, the pastor comes off as just the right amount of creepy and he eventually lives up to the nagging feeling that you have in the back of your head while you are watching him.  If you are from the area, or are interested in the fracking that is happening on the Baken, this is a great introduction to some of the issues that the long time locals are dealing with.

6817707,3,B00PLYUB8Q,"This documentary is worth seeing, but is not anywhere on the same level of Grapes of Wrath or of top notch documentary films.

It can't decide on its focus and as a result, it comes across muddled and a shotgun approach.  Is it about the pastor?  Is it about his congregation?  Is it about the community?  Is it about those seeking employment in the North Dakota oil fields but who cannot find work (apparently the Overnighters of the title)?  It doesn't have the focus to pull on of these subjects together into something that gives real insight into what is going on there.  Good for what it is, but it is not going to go down as a great documentary.

The pastor comes across throughout as in over his head and the ""surprise"" ending (not that big of a surprise) shifts the narrative to him instead of the Overnighters.

Not as hard-hitting as great documentaries (try Harvest of Shame or Harlan County, USA to see how a documentary can show the plight of workers).",1433203200,4,966,4.505747126436781

6817713,3,B00PLYUB8Q,Heartbreaking. Town overwhelmed by homeless. Pastor tries to do the right thing by the homeless but wrecks a church by failing to build a consensus. Puts himself at odds with the town already struggling to deal with change. It makes a good showing about the need of homeless people in a down turned economy but these things can only be addressed as a community. While a single person may begin the process it must be addressed by a larger group. His own personal gender struggle just added to the layers of difficulty and exhaustion.

The way this documentary was presented, I was really expecting to be outraged at the insensitivity of certain members of the community in Williston, fighting against what seems to be a very good cause, a homeless shelter... Halfway thru the film I found I had a lot of empathy for the members of the church and the community, and some of the overnighters themselves, until finally at the end, I found that one of the poeple I felt little empathy for was the pastor himself. This is a great film, I really didn't expect the outcome. One may also find interesting that one of the main characters in this film was later charged in Williston with multiple felonies relating to gross sexual imposition, human trafficking, terrorizing, felonious restraint and several other charges.

The last few minutes of the film (literally, the last few minutes) abandon this larger investigation of community and amount to an involuntary outing of the pastor's wife and family. What a piece of crap?! I can only conclude that the protagonist (the pastor) is a narcissist of the first order and that the filmmakers are his enablers. You should all be very ashamed of yourselves.

8688612,4,B00PLYUB8Q,"Willston, ND is an oil boomtown, where people from all over search for the American Dream.  The men flooding the town are broken and desperate, bringing whatever sorrows they possess with them.  Fear and infrastructure issues plague Willston, and  Pastor Jay Reinke opens his church doors (and his home) to those searching for work.  Pastor Reinke sees these men as human beings that are worthy of respect, equal opportunities, and human kindness.  However, the onslaught of people from different locations, of different ethnicities, and sketchy backgrounds bring fear and resistance to Willston and Reinke congregants.

The last straw came when a New Yorker named Paul Engel was kicked out of the Pastors home.  Engel claims he was kicked out to make room for a sex offender from L.A., and in retaliation leaks the story to the local paper.  What ensues is a culmination of someone who put his family, career, reputation, and spirituality on the line to help what he calls ""sinners.""

The thing is, these weren't sinners in the Christian context.  They were violent sex offenders, people changing scenarios but not situations, and those who needed more than a sleeping space.  Reinke was noble in his efforts to help the migrants, but he was too noble.  He questions whether his efforts were self-serving, and as the film progresses that appears to be the case.  He puts the doctrine before common sense, with his loved ones and congregation paying the price.  Reinke couldn't save everyone and didn't know how to say no.

This documentary shows the viewers that even with their flaws, most of the men coming to ND want to work.  But as with most people leaving with nothing more than the shirts on their backs, they have needs beyond finding a job.  These workers also represent the lowest rungs in society, and and no one wants them in their town.  Everyone wants to reap the rewards of big business as long as the help aren't seen or heard.
