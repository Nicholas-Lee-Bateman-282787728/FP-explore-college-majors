687081,5,6303542255,"""Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture"" is one of the better video game based Anime's. Even though the characters have this peculiar look to them, overall animation is beautifully drawn and accentuated by the energetic action sequences. A story of several martial artists out to stop a man from achieving god-like status, by acquiring Armor of God, might seem a bit cheesy at first, but once you get into the movie, it is very exciting to watch. Another great thing about this Anime is that you don't have to know a thing about the video game to appreciate the movie. But if you do play the video game, it is even a bigger treat, to see all those awesome fighting moves come to life in full force. Quite an action spectacle.",944438400,14,717,4.523076923076923
687082,5,6303542255,"This movie has fast flowing animation of excellent quality.  The fight scenes tend to build up further nad further.  Being a fighting movie gives a sterotype of all action and lack of plot, but this movie rewards the  viewer with a strong gripping plot that only grows throughout the movie.",939600000,,290,4.76
687083,5,6303542255,"The popular videogame series explodes onto the screen with fast action, killer soundtrack, and stunning visuals.  This is the third of the Fatal Fury anime series and suprisingly you don't need to watch the first two to  understand what's going on(although it wouldn't hurt).  I would recommend  it to anyone who loves fast paced anime, they even throw in some love  themes for you wusses out there(no not pornos).  I would recommend buying  the box set with all three movies but if you just want to watch one or if  you are too poor, buy only this one as it stands very well by itself.  Superb animation combined with good dubbing and a soundtrack that you will  be humming on your way to work(the ending theme ""Oh Angel"" fits  perfectly with the last scene).  What are you waiting for, hurry up and get  this masterpiece.",921888000,,823,4.593103448275862
7851106,5,6303542255,"Very great movie for being a full lenght movie that is from the early 1990s and based of a video game (Neo Geo) also from the 1990s.  If you like anime (lots of action,powers, and half nude chicks) then you'll like this movie. Oh, if you havn't watched the second movie then some parts won't make any sense.",1304294400,,307,4.293103448275862
7851107,1,6303542255,"To be quite honest! This movie SUCKED! The story was somewhat senseless, the villien, Laocorn was very boring and stupid, some of the characters were dumb, and most of all, Mai was ruined and acted  silly and annoying! But, there was one character I liked, Laocorn's lovely, and cute sister, Sulia! I'm telling you! This movie was soooooooooooooooo BORING! The fight secens wern't too bad! But, even those were boring! So, if you are a Fatal Fury fan or not, stay away from this movie!",1126828800,5,485,4.705882352941177
7851108,5,6303542255,"Fatal Fury the movie is one of a kind anime mix with a video game. Street Fighter is still the other anime that I like because bringing the favor into the character is wonderful. Terry is the calm, street fighter, Andy is stressed out because of Mai, Joe acts like a bonehead and Mai is a bit pighead sucking up to Andy to protect her. When one of the pieces of ""Armor of Mars"" was founded by ""Laocorn"" he plans to use all six pieces to become a god. Not only that his twin sister Sulia asked Terry to help her brother to be free of the cruse. Terry and his team went on to find the armor to prevent Laocorn to be controled by the armor. Fatal Fury action, drama,and some comedy to impress the fans. Special apperances by Kim Kapwhan, Duck King, Billy Kane and others from FF2. What makes also makes this movie special is the song ""Oh Angel"" at the credits. sounds romatic.",1004918400,3,873,4.233532934131737
7851109,5,6303542255,"I'm a fan of the original games.  This movie made me an even greater fan at that.  To see this movie, however, you have to be schooled in the fatal fury universe, and have seen atleast the second tape of the three....the one with krauser.
Things wouldnt be the same in this for someone who hasn't seen the previous tape, like who kim is....the tae kwon do master whom is there to fight terry, but ends up beating a guy who almost kills him infront of his wife and children.  Kim is my favorite character since i saw this movie....but i'm biased because I study the same fighting style as he does.
Bottom line, this is a fighter's movie.",994636800,,636,4.3277310924369745
7851110,5,6303542255,"This movie ROCKS! I saw it on sci-fi and i just HAD to buy it. The plot is well written and if you pay attention it isn't confusing at all. The characters are also well ""played"" out. This movie stays in your head it will just blow you away. The animation in it is wonderful. It's clear precise and shows the characters emotions well. If you like anime or are just starting to develop an intrest then you should really get this it's awsome it really is. There is lots of fighting but nothing really bloody and horible. The movie itself is WONDERFUL i can't say anything else i am just blown away. you could watch it again and again. (and believe me i have) if you like this movie you should also look Armitage and if they have it on this site E.Y.E.S. of Mars it's wicked cool. all in all i gave this movie five stars because it kicks mayjor butt. it's simply amazing.",994291200,,867,4.228915662650603
7851111,5,6303542255,"Anime and fighting video games is usually a bad mix.  ('The Art of Fighting' is all the proof you need.)  Once in a great while, though, an absolute gem is crafted from putting the two together, and this, to me, is the shiniest of them all.  ""Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture"" is hands-down the best anime based on a fighting game ever made, even surpassing the awesome ""Street Fighter II"".  Why is it so great?  Let me count the ways...first off, the plot and story are both fantastic, not to mention completely original.  The ""good guys"" from the Fatal Fury series unite to stop a young man who is trying to gather the legendary ""Armor of Mars"" and achieve godhood.  The kicker is, the young man's own sister is the one who unites the four heroes.  What makes the story so great, though, is just how the characters interact with each other in trotting the globe to beat the would-be god and his henchmen to each piece of the armor.  It adds a lot of depth to an already great movie.  The animation is top-notch; fluid and very smooth.  The fight scenes are incredible, and the ""special techniques"" are wonderfully reproduced on the small screen.  Almost every fighter from the games appears in the film, and each has a place in the story; they're not just ""thrown in"" for the sake of appearances.  The character designs are awesome, of course; what else would you expect from the legendary Masami Obari?  The backgrounds, the orchestral soundtrack, Joe Higashi's cheesy one-liners...I could go on all day!  Everything about this anime makes it a must-buy for any anime fan's collection.  Fatal Fury fans will eat this one alive if they haven't already, as well as anyone who's craving a well-done action flick with a great story to boot.  This is a true anime classic!",988588800,,1768,4.633440514469453
7851112,3,6303542255,"Having watched both Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury 3 at one go, I felt rather relieved that Fatal Fury 3, unlike its predecessor, did not fall into the trap of becoming a Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie clone. In an  attempt to make Fatal Fury 2 rest on a series of thematic tensions instead  of an actual plot, most conventional plot structures were disposed of, save  for a singular key idea around which various scenes were constructed. What  emerged however, was not ""plotless art"" that Street Fighter 2:  The Animated Movie may pass off as, but something artlessly plotless. Fatal  Fury 3, with a coherent storyline, is easier to digest.
Despite promises  of action-packed adventure, Fatal Fury 3 falls short of expectations. It  had a decent start, with Laocorn and his henchmen blasting off a group of  archaeologists who had discovered the third fragment, as well as Sulia  being surrounded by Laocorn's unearthly masked minions in the arcade. Yet  tension dissipated in the midst of all the action. The historical context  of Fatal Fury 3 brought about by the missing fragments of the armour should  have aroused some interest, but this is undermined by Sulia's long and  dreary explanations, and more importantly, the somewhat trite way with  which Joe, Andy and Mai conducted their ""investigations"". Their  discoveries came along too easily; there was hardly any real detective  work, which dilutes the excitement of watching a mystery being unravelled  that was initially promised. Coupled with the flippancy of Mai and Joe  despite having a serious task to tackle, the superficiality of it all is  palpable.
Despite having a clear plot, Fatal Fury 3 threatens to fall  apart due to a loose structure. Given that the movie rests on the  development of a storyline, there is a need for narrative threads to be  weaved fairly tightly together so as to sustain dramatic anticipation.  There are a few incongruous scenes being thrown in, the best example of  which would be Geese Howard's appearance, and his irrelevant rumination of  how the wound on his chest is undermining his prowess. Such false arousal  of expectations frustrates attempts at building up tension, leaving me  fairly jaded as the climax approached. While certain parts of the movie  crawled, the climax came almost too suddenly. One minute, Sulia is caught  and the next minute, Terry is fighting Laocorn. Fatal Fury 3 fails to  deliver as a well-conceived whole.
In  terms of graphic animation, Fatal Fury 3 is passable, although it is my  personal opinion that the human drawings are not too appealing. Their  slanted slit eyes and incredibly sharp certainly makes The Hungry Wolf an  appropriate secondary title to the movie! Having said this, I confess that  the drawings are by the least consistent, unlike Flame of Recca, whose  characters seem different in a number of episodes. If (and only if) you are  a technical mania like me, you will notice that the drawings of Terry's  frame during his battle in the arcade are less well done than the  rest.
The version I saw was dubbed, and not too badly too. Thankfully,  all original music has been retained. The BGM was either surprisingly  sparse or unmemorable, for I only have hazy recollections about it. The  only vocal music used comes right at the end, during the credits, which I  feel is a good choice. The catchy melody appropriately captures the  feelings of triumph, as well as nostalgic sadness and loss evoked by the  visual image of Terry flinging his hat away, used to end the movie.
As a  motion picture, Fatal Fury 3 disappoints. Probably only those who enjoy the  game will truly appreciate the action, and those who do not will find this  mildly entertaining well, I will have to reach a compromise in giving the  overall rating!",965779200,2,3785,4.902053712480253

It has a few things that aren't noticed normally in the first view (watch the final battle scene a few times and you'll see some very well made thing)  The best thing is, unlike other  movies, you don't have to see the first two (Legend of the hungry wolf and  a new battle [I think]) to understand what there characters have gone  though (but it does help)",948240000,,387,4.319444444444445
