2828870,5,B000PY52CW,"If there are any television series that have had a difficult time making their way to DVD, this one is definitely not one of them. With the show's second-to-last season scheduled for an end-of-the-summer release (what a great way for fans to launch the new school year), ""Full House"" obviously continues to uphold its reputation for making terrific sales in the DVD department.

Although Season 6 continues to be my very favorite, this 7th year certainly does not disappoint with a helping of 24 spirited, lighthearted, and enjoyable episodes (per usual, of course). The season opens with the three Tanner girls returning from a fabulous summer at camp, and once they adjust to reality again, everyone begins another year of school, work, relationships, and fun. Family patriarch Danny Tanner is relishing in his engagement to the sweet and caring Vicky Larson, but as she takes a huge step forward in her booming career, and as Danny itches to set a wedding date, it becomes evident that maybe they can't have both. But as Danny fights to hang onto his relationship with Vicky, Joey is trying desperately to break away from Mrs. Carruthers, a pushy and overbearing school board member who really has the hots for him. Jesse and Becky have their own hands full with their two and a half-year-old twin boys, who are growing up right before their parents' eyes. Whether they are flushing Joey's watch down the toilet, throwing food or destroying Michelle's science project, it soon becomes evident that they need to be disciplined--but will Daddy the Softie be able to handle this?

Meanwhile, Tanner daughter DJ, Stephanie, and Michelle are doing some growing up of their own. High school senior DJ starts the year off strong with her longtime boyfriend, but everyone has to grow up sooner or later, and as DJ starts applying to colleges and branching out with other interests, will she feel stifled by her serious romance with Steve? 11-year-old Stephanie starts middle school for the first time and immediately befriends a hip and cool girl named Mickey, but she also butts heads with someone else. The hotheaded Gia initially has an agenda to make Stephanie's life miserable, but when Steph finally reaches her limit and strives to even the score, Gia might finally unleash her more sensitive side. Then there is second grader Michelle, who is trying to achieve more independence from her overprotective father and, later in the season, is perhaps the one most affected by her great grandfather Papouli's death (another excellent episode that allows the uncle/niece dynamic between Michelle and Jesse to shine through).

Season 7 also includes some very special guest stars, including music sensation Little Richard and renowned actress Suzanne Somers, and ""Wheel of Fortune"" icon Vanna White. If you love this show, definitely be sure to pick this one up on August 7. With a low $23 price (and sometimes less if you buy it at the right place), it's pretty tough to pass up. Now it's time to bring on Season 8, which was recently announced for a November 8, 2007 release! Interestingly, a deluxe ""complete series"" collection--with an outer box cover that is shaped like the Tanner house--will be coming out the exact same day, so for those who have been collecting the regular DVD's, you have a decision to make regarding whether or not you will purchase the new set. (If you're interested in the show ""Gilmore Girls,"" they, too, are releasing a full series set on the same day that the final season comes out.) Oh, the things these DVD companies do to mess with our minds and make extra money. :) In any case, you will be able to top off your ""Full House"" collection by Christmastime, which is great news for any fan!",1180224000,29,3720,4.873617693522907

2828872,5,B000PY52CW,"This is the Episode list for season 7

1. It Was a Dark and Stormy Night

When his daughters return from an extended summer camp, Danny is disappointed to learn that they didn't seem to miss home too much. Later, when everyone learns that Michelle brought a wild rabbit home in her duffel bag, the girls happily ride back to the camp grounds with Steve to set the animal free. Unfortunately, when a severe thunderstorm hits, this unexpected little visit back to their ""home away from home"" becomes a little freakier than anyone expected. Meanwhile, Jesse and Becky's nightmares have been taking place before they fall asleep, because their rambunctious twin boys refuse to sleep in their own beds.

2. The Apartment

Danny feels very uncomfortable with DJ going to Steve's new apartment. And to make matters worse DJ and Steve fall asleep watching TV. When they have no place to go to be alone to talk they climb into the cement truck that is in the backyard because Jesse and Joey are putting in a new driveway. Steve accidentally hits the lever that moves the shut and turns on the cement.

3. Wrong Way Tanner

While Michelle is delighted to be playing on Coach Joey's soccer team, it is evident that she is not the natural athlete that her older sisters were at her age. Determined to see his little girl succeed, Danny pushes Michelle to practice her skills--only to cause further problems when Michelle unintentionally scores the winning goal for the other team. The youngest Tanner is prepared to quit soccer for good now, and it might require a team effort from the entire family to help her through her embarrassment. Meanwhile, Stephanie--who is putting together a special home video for school--uses her trademark sneakiness to catch each family member at some of their most humiliating moments.

4. Tough Love

When kids are out of control it's time to say NO. That is what Becky and Jesse face when the boys are acting any way they want and nobody is telling them NO. Their behavior is effecting the whole Tanner household. Vicky fixes dinner for the family for the first time.

5. Fast Friends

Stephanie makes a new friend, Mickey. But Mickey's friends smoke and Stephanie is pressured to too. Will she?

6. Smash Club: Next Generation

Jesse has just inherited the Smash Club. He gets inspiration from the kids as to what to do with it. But not having very good business sense Jesse struggles to try to get a loan to fix it up.

7. High Anxiety

Realizing your last baby is growing up is a hard thing to let go of. Danny is going through this in this episode when Michelle wants to start making decisions for herself and Danny has a hard time with this.

8.  Another Opening, Another No Show

Cappuccino machine not working, REM is not the REM they were expecting, Jesse is locked in the storage room... with Kimmy, Kimmy grabs Jesse toush, and a food critic. All on opening night at the Smash Club. What else could go wrong?

9. The Day of the Rhino

No matter how old or young you are its never wrong to speak your mind when you have been ripped off by false advertising. This is the case for Michelle and all the other kids who sent away for a big Action Rigby toy and received a small plastic one that does nothing.

10. The Prying Game

Many people say things they regret later when they are angry. This was the case for DJ when she finds Stephanie and Kimmy hiding out in Steve's apartment. Stephanie's intentions were good but her actions were wrong. DJ says some mean things to Steph but later realizes her errors.

11. The Bicycle Thief

A bicycle watch group is formed when Michelle reports that her bicycle is stolen. In a strange turn of events Danny, Jesse and Joey turn into the thieves by mistake.

12. Support Your Local Parents

You can't hide things from Danny. He has the ""nose"" of a bloodhound. When DJ gets a ticket she tries to cover it up but Steph and Michelle find out and use this against DJ to get what they want. Meanwhile Jesse and Becky finally realize that they need help with the twins.

13. The Perfect Couple

As the new host of a couple's game show, Joey enlists the help of Jesse, Becky, Steve, DJ, Danny, and Vicky to be the contestants for a trial run episode. When Vicky cannot make it, Danny is paired with the loudmouthed Estelle. Juicier and more entertaining television is sought by causing the couples to argue in front of the camera, but the fun and games are over when, upon Vicky's return, she and Danny make a devastating decision about their engagement.

14.  Is it True about Stephanie

Pursued by a cute boy at school, Stephanie faces a problem with fellow classmate Gia, who also likes the same guy. In her refusal to put up with the girl's threats, Stephanie faces humiliation when Gia spreads a vicious rumor about her. Stephanie manages to plot quite an impressive comeback, but its impact on Gia makes the revenge less than sweet. Meanwhile, Danny--who is miserable without Vicky and desperate to avoid the painful memories--disrupts the natural flow of the household by rearranging everything.

15. The Test

Dreams can seem so real as in the case for DJ who is worried about her SAT's. The test has her so nervous that she has a nightmare about the test.

16. Joey's Funny Valentine

Being a comedian can sometimes be a challenging job as people expect you to be funny all the time. Roxie, Joey's new girlfriend tries to make a good impression on the Tanner family. Things don't go exactly as hoped.

17. The Last Dance

When Jesse's beloved grandfather Papouli arrives from Greece for a visit, the man fills the entire house with his loving and lighthearted perspective on life. The family is crushed when he dies in his sleep, but no one is more impacted than Jesse and Michelle, who are both struggling to reveal their true emotions. The bond between them is stronger than ever, however, and in the wake of this devastating tragedy, they just might be able to help each other heal.

18. Kissing Cousins

Who appears to be somebody can totally be the opposite. This is the case with Stavros, Jesse's cousin from Greece. Jesse can see no wrong in Stavros but the rest of the family see's right through him. It's just a matter of showing Jesse who Stavros really is.

19. Love on the Rocks

Don't expect to pull off a prank when you label a tape prank on Joey. DJ is growing up and begins to comprehend that life shouldn't revolve around a boyfriend. If it does you miss out on so much other things.

20. Michelle a la Cart

Soapbox Derby's are not just for boys any longer. Michelle proves this as she wants to enter the race. She not only wants to enter but she wants to win. Grownups must remember what they say even in a kidding manner that younger kids might take what they say to heart as Michelle did when Jesse, Becky and Danny were making jokes about a girl building a car.

21. Be Your Own Best Friend

Michelle learns a valuable lesson in this episode. She learns you can't buy friendship. She also learns you can have more then one best friend.

22. A Date with Fate

It's not when you celebrate ""Mothers Day"" when you are a kid its the thought behind it. DJ and Danny end up dateless at a restaurant that they both ended up at.

23. Too Little Richard Too Late

Joey points out at a PTA meeting in which he is running for president in that it's not who gives birth to the kids its the ones that are there for them when they are sick or sad. When they nightmare or need help with homework.

24. A House Divided

The family face a tempting situation when a wealthy old man--who lived in the Tanners' home many years ago--offers them a tidy sum of money for the house. While everyone is thrilled about getting a bigger place, Michelle is upset over the idea--especially when Jesse, Becky, and Joey talk about branching out and buying their own houses. Determined to keep her family together, it will take all the sneaky tricks this 7-year-old possesses to reverse Danny's plans to sell.",1178582400,47,7970,4.531424581005586
2828873,5,B000PY52CW,"The 7th season of the show continues everything good fans have come to know, albeit with some things taking a turn.  For example, whereas plans had been for Danny and Vicki to get together, it ends up not happening for fear Danny not single would ruin the premise of the show.  Thus, we are left imagining only what could have been.  Also, Michelle is now definitely out of her cute little kid phase, yet the plots tend to focus more and more on her and her friends.  They are fun and entertaining plots, but you have to get used to her at this age and not everyone is a fan of that, I understand.  Nevertheless, provided you do get used to that, it is as always a fun and entertaining season and follows to form everything that made the show great.",1178409600,16,749,4.283687943262412

2828880,5,B000PY52CW,"I am 32, I grew up watching this.  I even called it the ""Michelle show"" way before I was old enough to care what it was called. I would tell my mom to call me inside from playing to watch in when it came on. It was a great show back then and still is today! The thing is today they just don't make (or rarely make) good, clean, and actually funny family shows! I would sooooooo much rather my kids watch this on DVD than just about anything that comes on TV! And don't even get me started on video games. Sometimes at least, do you just want to sit and watch something as a family where you never have to cover little eyes or say ""don't repeat that""? Then I suggest this strongly!!
This season is particularly awesome to me because,  DJ is dealing with older teen stuff, Michelle and Stephanie are sharing a room and learning to respect each other. Jessy and Rebecca live up stairs with the twins who are walking and talking. Joey is the bachelor without children, but very much raising children. Danny is a single dad, widowed at the start of the series, trying to juggle 3 girls, a career, his obsessive cleaning habits, and trying the dating world. There is a house full of people dealing with a wide range and variety of issues that just about anyone has someone to relate to. It's always funny and there is always a moral or lesson to every episode. Plus the history that is ""accidentally "" packed in because it was ""so long ago"" according to my kids lol. They use landlines, VCRS, one TV in the house, stuff my kids find unreal, but they are fascinated by it!
It came a little slow, I ordered used, but it was in great condition!

2828924,5,B000PY52CW,"For those of us who grew up on Full House, it's still a favorite for most of us today.  Several years ago, I passed my love of the show onto my daughters, who now love it just as much (or maybe even more, than I do.)  Every year I buy them a new season or two.  This year we're up to the 7th.  We're just sad that next season, it comes to an end.  (Although, my middle daughter is holding out hope for them to make more.  I haven't broke it to her yet that the girls are all grown up and my age.  I probably should, but I like the little mysteries in life that makes my kids happy.)

If anything, I think the series only improved with time.  For those that haven't seen it - it's classic 80's TV.  With good, wholesome, family values.  They try to solve the little problems in life.  (And as in the case of TV, they can always solve them in 30 minutes or less, and the kids are always willing to listen to the wisdom of their parents and those older than them.  Oh, if only...)  But, I think that's why we all liked 80's TV so much.  It was pure.  The problems were real to life, but they mostly ended happily.  And isn't that what we all want out of life?  So, if we can't get it in real life, we might as well immerse ourselves in the pretend world for a little while and let them solve life's problems for us.  And although the problems do get solved quickly, they're real problems.  They're problems that we all faced at one time or another in life.  Problems our children, especially our girls, still face.  They have issues with boys, drinking, weight, parties, abuse, and even death.  Heck, the whole thing revolves around them losing their mother at an early age, and being raised by their dad, uncle and dad's best friend.  The comedy is fantastic, the music even better - ahhh Uncle Jessie! and it's no surprise why it still is one of my favorite TV shows today.  And of course, since the twin boys are now toddlers in this season, I think my middle daughter can relate even more - as her little brother is the same age, and just as much a terror.  She likes to watch the conflicts the girls have with them.  It makes her realize, she isn't alone.  (She's just glad there is only 1 of her brother.)  ;)",1388102400,2,2212,4.163120567375887

I like ""The Perfect Couple"" where Joey hosts a game show about relationships, but it's very sad at the end of that episode where Danny and Vikki break-up because Vikki got a new job far away and their long distance relationship doesn't work out!! It's also sad in the episode ""Love on the Rocks"" when DJ has to question her relationship with Steve and they find out that things aren't like the way they were when they first started dating! Those are the saddest episodes of Full House ever made in my opinion! Again, Full House is my most all-time FAVORITE TV show, and I'm SO glad I finally have all the seasons!!",1367798400,,921,4.209039548022599

Still, there's enough left to cause drama.  Jessie and Becky's marriage is always fun to watch as long as those two cute little twins that, as we well know by now, have only been put on the show to deliver cuteness when the writer's realized Michelle would be too old to do that.  And in this season, we begin to see that the cuteness of the younger female Tanner has indeed come to an end.

Still, this is an excellent show - much better then things you find on television today.",1350777600,,679,4.24031007751938

2828950,5,B000PY52CW,My daughter became a huge fan of full house when she was 7 years old. We slowly bought her the dvd sets (1-8). She is 9 years old now and still loves them. They are wholesome TV in a time when there isn't much of that for kids who are past Nick jr and disney jr and not quite ready for icarly and the like. I feel good that I can leave the room and not worry about what she is seeing me without her. I wish today's tv producers and writers would take a page out of some of the 80's shows that the whole family could feel comfortable watching together.,1342483200,,551,3.9285714285714284

The characters you like, the characters you hate.
I like Donna Jo (D.J.), Stephanie, Jesse, Rebecca & Danny.
I hate Michelle & Joey.

The Olson twins could  NOT act.  And, if I heard ""Cut It Out"" out of Joey 1 more time.

In this season we ended the Danny & Vickie romance.  I had like the Vickie character.

They had done this throughout the show.  Tired show ideas & stealing ideas from other shows.
Example disc 24. ""A House Divided"" Where Michelle & her friends wreck the house to prevent Danny from selling it.  Let's go back in time.  Third season of  ""The Partridge Family"" episode 13 ""For Sale By Owner"" same thing happened.

I just hated episode 18 ""Kissing Cousins"".  John playing a look alike cousin.  Man was that bad.

Episode 8 ""Another Opening, Another No Show"".  How many times in the show's 8 seasons did someone get locked in show place?

Normally the show was good family entertainment, same with this season BUT with these flaws.",1298592000,,1045,4.468085106382978

That day never came THANK F'IN GOD! I can't tell you enough how bad this show is. Sure, everyone and their momma's hot in it (besides the goofy-goof ball, Kimmy. She's a witch!) and John Stamos (as usual) just oozes all that sexiness. I would...Anyway, back the review.

If you don't remind me I'll always trail off into a world of bittersweet dreams filled with awesomely-charming Men such as John Stamos! b^_^;;

I actually like DJ (Deej) and I saw a decent episode just today; her and her painfully-attractive boyfriend were having relationship troubles (although I think it was ALL in her pretty little mind): He was going off to college to leave her fending on her own with only a few calls and visits every couple of months. Trust me when I say I totally appreciate and bought her pain; I would feel the same if I had a life partner (or a boyfriend) who decided he wanted to go out-of-state (or wherever it was he wanted to go to attend schooling) and leave me lonely. I'd be a flipping mess!

I don't think thing did work out in the end. He goes off and she just has to bite her lip and deal. The twins were cute but terrible, terrible actors. No one was outstanding although the adults in particular were decent David Coulier, funny.

Michelle had an African-American friend named Teddy who did move away, but he returned and she even claimed him as a boyfriend in a later episode.

2828969,4,B000PY52CW,"I've been purchasing each season for my daughter but have noticed the DVD version looks like a second generation copy and is not of the same video quality currently on TV. It's unfortunate that whomever is responsible for releasing these DVDs doesn't use the original studio copy and digitally clean-up the video prior to creating the DVD image. It looks like a mediocre VHS quality pushed to a DVD. The DVD chapters are done like a newbie did it and there are no real special features. The creation of these DVDs are a quick money hit for whomever is doing it. If it's someone with the owning studio then they should be fired, and if its an release group the contract should be terminated.

If you have a Tivo and DVD creation software then do your own and you'll get the same or a lot better quality. I sure you teenage daughter or son would have no problem in generating a comparable copy of what your going to purchase. The best thing about this release is the packaging and the series.

Now other than the above complaints the series are just as good as they originally were, that under the impression that you originally liked them. My daughter loves them and that is why I buy them.",1189900800,,1189,4.474654377880184

Everyone continues to grow and learn.  D.J. (Candace Cameron) is finding facing the SAT's a nightmare.  On the plus side, her boyfriend Steve (Scott Weinger) has moved into his own apartment.  Middle daughter Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) has to make all new friends when she enters a junior high school where she knows no one.  Meanwhile, Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) must decide between her old best friend and her new best friend when Teddy (Tahj Mowry) moves back to town.

The adults face new challenges as well.  Danny (Bob Saget) faces a hard decision with his fiancee.  Joey (Dave Coulier) has a new girlfriend.  Jesse (John Stamos) and Becky (Lori Loughlin) must deal with disciplining their twins.  And Jesse inherits his band's old stomping grounds, that is, if he can keep The Smash Club open.

There are also some episodes with more serious themes.  Stephanie leads an anti-smoking episode.  Michelle enters a soap box derby and learns that girls can do anything, too.  And the whole family learns some lessons when Jesse's grandfather unexpectedly dies.

By this point in the series, things were moving along fairly well.  The characters and actors are well established, but they keep finding new challenges for everyone to deal with.  The show is still sweet, but the cuteness factor has diminished as the girls have grown up.  As have the use of the various catch phrases the characters used to say.  This is still wholesome entertainment the entire family can enjoy.

Since this is season seven, most people have already made up their minds about the show.  If you love it, you'll love this latest set.  And if you don't, there's nothing here that will change your mind.",1189382400,4,1855,4.912903225806452

Obviously through the years, the kids are all growing up and maturing and that brings about some interesting situations.  In the episode Fast Friends, Steph hangs out with kids that smoke and make her feel pressured to do the same.  I also like The Apartment where Steve buys an apartment and DJ sleeps on the couch.  Danny finds her (after she's late coming home) and gets pretty angry.
Full House is such a great show that I'm sure young kids today would still like, and older 'kids' like me still like because I grew up watching it.  There's never been a cooler (or cuter) uncle than Uncle Jesse, and the love between all the family is great and fun to watch.
