8221014,5,B000W234UE,"I like this DVD a lot. I do think it is an advanced exercise DVD but you can modify the exercises when necessary. It is 43 minutes and includes a warm up and cool down. I have all of Gunnars workout DVDs and as I mention in all my reviews of his DVDs, Gunnar has a variety of exercises he uses to work the same muscle group and FEW repeat exercises throughout the Core Secret series of DVDs. If you like Gunnar you will like this DVD. I recommend this DVD to exercise enthusiasts who want a challenging workout. I recommend this DVD and I will purchase more of Gunnar's DVDs in the future if he makes any more.",1366761600,,610,4.1344537815126055
