6111804,5,B00GT4NCBU,Great series and the delivery and condition were excellent.  Worth seeing if you enjoy sci-fi or just exciting viewing.  A great experience,1394236800,,139,5.2727272727272725
6111805,4,B00GT4NCBU,"I also got this at Walmart. Same problem with the white line across the top of the screen. Also, it comes in cheap cases that do not hold the discs in place. However it's great to have it available and at a low price. These are single sided discs, like the first season and unlike the other (edited) seasons made by Alliance (ALL). I don't know if this was edited or if they toned down the nudity and language toward the end of the series). Single sided discs are less susceptible to scratches and other defects. Several terrific episodes make this well worth paying $13 for.",1392854400,6,575,4.433962264150943
6111806,3,B00GT4NCBU,"I hope your television has an option that allows you to zoom ever so slightly, because starting with the first episode on the set, you'll see little flickering bars just slightly visible at the top of the screen. Luckily, my television has a zoom option called ""Normal"", because the ""Full 100%"" option was going to drive me insane with the flickering at the top of the screen, and the other aspect options were going to cut too much of the image off to be enjoyable. For the record, I got this set for about $13 at WalMart, so if you have the option to zoom in ever so slightly, you'll probably still enjoy this set even though there aren't any special features to speak of.",1392768000,8,674,4.4

6111812,5,B00GT4NCBU,"First a confession. I did not buy this item from Amazon. However I did buy all seven seasons of The Outer Limits DVDs that are produced by Alliance through Amazon. I saw this item at a retail bargain outlet store and it was only a few dollars so I figured what the heck, go on and get it. Overall it is a good product and each DVD has its own spindle as opposed to the lousy packaging seen in the Alliance produced DVDs. Also I have no complaints with the picture quality and the DVDs did play with no problems. I'm very happy with this product.

Now all of the Season Seven episodes are good but some do stand out. I will describe some and I will try to keep it short.

* Abduction: Definitely my Season Seven favorite and in the top five for my favorites for the whole series. So I may be lengthy and descriptive. In this episode five high school students with little in common and are not friends with one another are starting their school day. The school is bathed in bright white light and everyone and everything except a small part of the school vanishes. Everyone freaks out and they try to figure out what is happening. In time an alien appears. The alien tells the students that they are part of an experiment where one of the students is to die. The other four will be allowed to return to their lives and it will be the alien who will perform the execution. It is on the students to determine who among them is to die. If no one chooses then everyone dies. The alien gives them five hours to decide and leaves. During those five hours there is much dialogue among the students as to what should be done. Also during this time one of the students emerges as the leader and we see the social outcast who makes things difficult for everyone. Five hours elapse and the alien returns. Time for the students to cast their votes. The emerged leader votes no and manages to encourage three other students to vote no. It is time for the social outcast to vote. In spite of all pleading by the emerged leader not to vote the outcast does select a student-the emerged leader. The alien zaps that student killing her. The alien leaves the students to ponder the decision made. The outcast gets roughed up by one of the other students and a gun falls off his waistband. Another student finds the gun and the outcasts backpack is searched and yearbook pages with the photos of the other four students were circled. It is apparent what the motives of the outcast was. That student would tell the other students that he resented them and would blame them for his problems but would deny wanting to kill them. After that the other students vanish and the outcast is left alone with the dead student. After a period of self pity he does have a change of heart and finds himself truly sorry for the choice he made. At this point the alien reemerges and tells the student he was the reason for the experiment and that he would have shot his fellow students and it was the aliens intention that the student not go through with his plans. With that the alien returns that student and the other students to the time and place when abducted. That would include the student who was ""killed' who would be very much alive. The other four students would look at the fifth student in a way that is not hostile but rather that he has a task to perform. With that he goes into the principals office, gives up the gun and to await the inevitable consequences.

I have others but the descriptions won't be a lengthy.

* Free Spirit: This one has the makings of a Stephen King novel, mainly with the setting. An individual who was part of an experiment that went wrong is out seeking revenge. That individual is not a ghost, after all this is science fiction.

* Time to Time: This one ties in with episodes Tribunal and Gettysburg. In this one we see time traveler Nicholas Prentice's time travel operation and how team members are recruited. One of Prentice's underlings snatches a young woman from the year 1989 moments before she would have been killed as a possible team member. Prentice has doubts about that woman but in the end she makes a difficult choice and would become a member of Nicholas Prentice's time travel operation.

* Mona Lisa: Mona Lisa is a android in female form created to perform as an assassin. The creators would give Mona emotions, free choice, and a moral compass. With that Mona does not want to be an assassin and escapes and will be actively pursued. Mona befriends a woman who helps Mona escape. Mona and the other woman get to talking and the woman tells Mona about her daughter who her ex husband abducted. Mona will help that woman find her daughter before self destructing to evade capture.

I do have a couple more things to say about this series. One is how some episodes reference back to previous episodes. That is done by excerpts from previous episodes being seen in the more current episode. I loved that. The Season Seven episodes where that is done really well are The Human Factor and Human Trials. However this is done in the other seasons as well.

The other is how I got acquainted with this The Outer Limits series. Back when this series was in syndication and in its second season I was looking at the weekly television schedule that my local paper use to publish and I would see this program mentioned. I would tune in thinking it was the original series. When it became apparent that it wasn't the original I was shocked and disappointed. I would tune in anyway and I quickly fell in love with it. From that point on I made sure to tune in every week. I would watch every episode from that point on and I would make sure to see the episodes that I missed. I will even go as far to say that this series is every bit as good as the original The Outer Limits series. This will conclude my review.",1425686400,2,5828,4.409851301115242

6111824,5,B00GT4NCBU,"Well, if you are a Outer Limts Junky, and Sci-Fi fan as I am, and you are compiling a collection of all the episodes of the Outer Limits, then you have to add this to your collection. The Final Season is the episodes & stories from the Later Series that was aired from 16 march 2001 to 18 January 2002. These episodes was on the tail end of the Relaunch of The Twilight Zone series which started  in 1995. Although some Twilight Zone and Sci-Fi purist may claim that these episodes are not ""True to The Cloth of classic Sci-Fi, and to the Original Series from the 60'S,  these are some good episodes, entertaining, make you go ""Hmmmmmmmm""  and I think add to your collection",1405468800,4,674,4.376
6111825,4,B00GT4NCBU,"Yeah, many episodes which recycle premises done better before, but if you've gone this far with the series, you won't want to miss the final season. Even seemingly predictable shows like ""Family Values"" end with a final message that's a little different. I don't believe any of the episodes were censored  since these were made for SciFi channel. The mild nudity in ""Think like a dinosaur"" (topless actress) was on cable and the dvds.

I bought the TGG and Alliance DVD sets of Season 7. On the TGG release, episodes typically run almost 44 minutes, and look much better than my cable recordings. Downside is interlacing (combing) is very noticeable on an HDTV, especially if you compare identical episodes which were released on the MGM ""theme"" collections. Looks like the video was compressed more (some blocky artifacts and dot crawl), even tho they used duallayer dvds so they should look the same.
I put one disc in my PC, and I can see the thin flickering line at the top - I don't know if it's on every episode. My older HDTV has ""overscan"" on (cuts off the edges of the picture), so the line doesnt appear. Newer TVs sometimes have ""overscan"" as an option that's ""off"" by default, so you'd need to turn it on.

The Canadian Alliance set (they were one of the show's producers) look abit better - higher bit rate, less compression. No thin line at the top, and there's a tiny bit more picture on the left side. See the ""customer images"" I uploaded from both sets. Episodes run an extra 40 seconds because they changed the End Credits: slowed the 45 second segment to 85 seconds, using a mellow bit of series music instead of the frantic opening credits music. An odd content change, but whatever.
The video is on 6 dvds instead of 5, and there's a French language option. No subtitles/closed captions on either release. And the package I got was the bad one with discs sliding around.
If your TV can play video with ""overscan"" on (so the top edge won't be visible), the TGG is probably the best for the price and availability. Qualitywise, the Alliance is better.",1404000000,21,2070,4.619565217391305
6111826,3,B00GT4NCBU,"Is this the original complete uncut version, or has it been edited/expurgated? I know that this is supposed to be a review, but I think it is very important to know whether or not this has been censored or altered in any way; I personally wouldn't want to buy this unless I know that it is the complete uncensored version.",1395014400,4,322,4.383333333333334
6111827,5,B00GT4NCBU,I love both the original Outer Limits and the revived series. I didn't buy the series while it was originally released and I was very glad to finally be able to get the last season to complete my collection.

Its basically comparable to taking 6 brand new cd's stacking them on your desk with a corrosive sheet of plastic in between each one.
