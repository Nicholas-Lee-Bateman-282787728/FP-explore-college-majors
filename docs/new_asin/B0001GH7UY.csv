8012164,1,B0001GH7UY,Probably one of the worst movies ever made. I purchased it because I was an extra in a scene when they filmed close to my hometown back in the 90s. All I can say is I am glad I was wearing a mask.,1496707200,,196,3.5813953488372094
8012165,3,B0001GH7UY,Not anything on the seller the movie was horrid. I bought it because it was filmed in part near my hometown.,1470873600,,108,4.190476190476191
8012166,4,B0001GH7UY,"This film is a B-list actor's dream if you like hilariously off beat movies. Palmer and his buddy are given a crate to take to Florida and have to make it there before New Year's Eve or the world will blow up, no other information needed there. Robert Kilpatrick is amazingly creepy and funny as the over the top homosexual psychopath criminal hired to stop Palmer's Pick-up. Robert Carradine and Richard Hillman are great as the the protagonists, some of Carradine's best acting in a while and Hillman gives a very true emotional performance when the script calls for it. Not a typical buddy/road comedy but one of my favorites in the long line. I hate mainstream and Palmer's Pick-up is a good independent comedy. Original in it's own right and definitely funny, despite these other reviewers. If you hate adam sandler, seth rogan, and kevin smith and like movies like Repo Man and Destiny Turns on the Radio or films by Terry Gilliam then Palmer's Pick-up is a good choice, don't buy the hype, buy the movie but only if you you are open-minded and don't need movies to hold your hand and explain everything to you, or watch it and experience something new.",1315699200,,1159,4.658536585365853
8012167,4,B0001GH7UY,"Despite the bad reviews of these other people I bought Palmer's Pick Up. I figured I could add it to my Truck Driver Movie collection at the least. Wow I'm so glad I did! I unlike the others laughed all the way through the movie. This is what I call a good bad movie. Damn near a great bad movie, all that was lacking was quite a few million dollars of production values. The bad guys in the movie, Bo and Mac were hilarious. The scene with the clowns and the mimes was beautiful. The only disappointing part of the movie was the ending which seemed a little rushed like they had to finish the movie in ten minutes (which may have been the case). This movie is crazy and wierd and yes bad, but it's supposed to be. I also enjoyed the great Americana of the great old roadside attractions they stopped at. They were a perfect addition to the feeling of the film. I know not everyone can enjoy a good bad movie but if you do...",1266710400,,925,4.173184357541899
8012168,1,B0001GH7UY,This has to be the worst movie Ive ever seen in my life. This movie was so bad I had to throw it away. This movie isn't worth watching till the very end to see what was in the crate they were hauling...,1206748800,,202,3.7209302325581395
8012169,1,B0001GH7UY,"I have to agree with the review by Colleen Shneider: This movie is not worth your time. I can explain a little more about why this is so.
First of all, this was billed as a comedy and yet I found little comedy in it. I do not recall laughing even once. The basic plot of the film is, to begin with, rather slim and predictable. The dialog is bad. The acting is bad and unbelievable. I say this even about the better actors that appeared in the film. At various times it looks like it is trying to be bizarre and catch our attention through unexpected scenarios. Yet, these seem entirely forced and ultimately contribute nothing to an ongoing narrative. Moreover, the subplots in the film are not resolved.
I waited to see if the ending would somehow tie the whole thing together. It did not. It left us hanging as to what the point of any of this was.
The only film I have seen that I would rate lower than this one was called something like ""The Little Devil"" which starred the later Walter Matthau. Made in Italy in the 80s it was worse than this one only in that it did not even succeed in creating a cohesive narrative.
Definitely, do not waste your time.",1064880000,2,1159,4.296803652968037
8012170,1,B0001GH7UY,"In looking over the video shelves my husband and I chanced upon this video and thought it looked interesting.  It started off with that REALLY low budget kind of filming, followed by really horrible dialog.  Still thinking it was kind of cheesy but sort of interesting we continued to watch as Palmer and his buddy Pearl drive cross country taking a crate (that they have been told not to open) to Florida.  This movie is bad on so many levels I wouldn't know where to begin.  Let's just say, it is not worth your time.  Take the 110 minutes and read a book or watch a good movie.  It isn't even good as a cheesy, goofy road trip movie.  It's just plain bad....that's why you've never heard anything about it and why there are no reviews on the box.  Pass this one up....Walk on by and keep going.  Trust me.",1041206400,2,808,4.333333333333333
