7829794,5,6302656079,"I am from Ponce Puerto Rico a beautiful town and rich in Culture. For the record, Ponce is not a poor town like people thinks. And Isa(Isabel Luberza) she was raised by a wealthy family. She had a heart of gold despite what people think of her past ""but"" she gave money to the poors and helped the catholic church and sent people to finish school or universities. My father knew her very well and I also knew her cousin we worked together at the Distrito de Ponce. I give the red carpet and my respect to the late Isabel Luberza Openheimer may rest in peace and only our Lord will judge her and deep in my heart I know she is resting in a better place.
