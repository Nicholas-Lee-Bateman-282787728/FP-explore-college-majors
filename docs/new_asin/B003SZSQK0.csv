8404800,3,B003SZSQK0,"This was a very well done presentation on the overall history of the development of the Islamic religion; however, it did gloss over some of the more objectionable aspects of the religion. For example, it did not mention that Muhammad beheaded the captured after a famous battle, which gives the modern Jihadists justification for their actions. It also did not do a good job explaining the organization of the Koran.  The book is organized by the length of the different sections rather than by the dates of when the sections were written.  As I understand it, the more tolerant and understanding sections were written early in Muhammad's life, while the more militant and restrictive sections were written last.  Since the religion gives more emphasis to the last written word, the casting of Islam as a peaceful, tolerant religion may be something of a stretch. In other words, there is a good history presentation, but it has been selectively edited to cast Islam in the best light.",1307836800,,986,4.927710843373494
