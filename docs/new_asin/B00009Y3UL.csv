8324757,5,B00009Y3UL,"Pedro plays a unique and interesting leading man, who only gets involved in picures because of his family's financial situation and because his mother and sister (played by Irma) are crazy about the movies. By chance he is ""discovered"" and it rolls from there with some very interesting twists and turns. The supporting cast are regulars who are, as usual, outstanding. Great comedy with some touching drama, great music (with some assistance from Pedro Vargas). To me the most impressive part is that Irma is finally given a character she can let loose with, and it's a pleasure to see. One of my favorites. (No subtiles- but get it anyway!)",1236038400,,642,4.845454545454546
8324758,5,B00009Y3UL,"One of the greatest stars of the golden age of Mexican cinema, Pedro Infante, stars in this delightful screwball comedy about a small town elementary school teacher who ventures out to the big city in the hopes that his little sister might become a famous movie star. The twist in the plot comes when he is offered a leading role in a movie instead of his sister. We follow this man as he learns the ropes of movie making. Along the way we are treated with a number of cameos, great songs, and plenty of laughs. The highlight of the film is probably a duet that is sung by Infante and another very famous singer whose name I won't mention. I don't want to ruin the surprise. Oh yeah! There's also a love interest. Enjoy! I did :)",1037059200,,729,4.2898550724637685
