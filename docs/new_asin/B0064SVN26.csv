4953575,5,B0064SVN26,"I like the 3D IMAX format, and my daughters enjoy watching documentaries in that format. I will be always aware of this type of documentaries on all who come in Spanish language.",1378425600,5,178,4.59375
4953576,3,B0064SVN26,"Three disc, three feature movies included in this set. If you like documentals, may be this is for you, but if you expect a little bit more action, just look for another feature.  Quality is good, I mean, in terms of 3d. There is also a 2d version included in the same disc. About 3d efects, let me tell you that in certain moments the 3d efect looks just plain or 2d. I watched those discs on a Sony screen with active shutter glasses, sometimes you can see the crosswalk efect, may be is the screen or may be the movie itself, problably if you went to watch them on a 3d Imax screen you would say that look spectacular. In may opinion, let me tell you that I was expecting a little bit more action, because sometimes, it seems that more scientis have to contributed in order to make these films up to the level, in other words, we need more information about everything, a high level of research. In wild ocean feature, there are moments that seems a little bit monotonous (bored), because for a few minutes you can see just the same scene. In the mummies, we need to see more about it, I guess the director has to go a little bit deeper in the story. Finally, I gave three stars, the 3d is still in diapers, I guess we have to wait a little bit in order to watch better shots.",1347321600,5,1279,4.199186991869919
4953577,5,B0064SVN26,"This set is a must-own for anyone with a 3D TV. While we do own quite a few non-IMAX 3D movies, we've found that the 3D is most effective when captured by the IMAX experts, so we have gravitated to all of these available and are slowly but surely collecting them all. This set is a tremendous value as these movies can be quite expensive individually if you aren't careful. And considering these movies are only about 45 minutes or so each, any extra value is appreciated.

Contrary to what the previous reviewer said, these movies are not packed in on a single disc. The case is of the extra wide variety and there is a swinging disc tray inside to hold the third disc. Yes, there are three - each movie gets its own disc and even includes its own special features, including interesting ""making of"" featurettes that were shot in HD. And yes, you can also watch these in 2D if for some strange reason you prefer that.

As far as the actual quality of the movies go, it's my opinion that Mummies is the best of the lot, with Wild Ocean taking 2nd place and Dinosaurs Alive trailing a ways behind. Which is mostly to be expected - IMAX movies are good because they're fun to look at and typically have great narration. Wild Ocean and Mummies has some beautiful footage, but Dinosaurs relies on a lot of CG that mucks up the experience some.

Overall, highly recommended set of movies. This deserves to be in any 3DTV owner's collection.",1343088000,17,1435,4.448669201520913
4953578,5,B0064SVN26,"you can buy the three features in this package for more than a used copy is on this site or get this one and enjoy the three imax shows on one 3d blu ray disc. Each imax show is only 40 minutes anyways so in this case it's not hard for them to do a triple pack. I have all of these shows and they are all good imax presentations. Some people don't like 'wild ocean' because it's about sardines and not the ocean though.  Still this is a great package at the used price. The 3d is native , shot that way and that makes a difference too.",1338768000,,535,3.908256880733945
