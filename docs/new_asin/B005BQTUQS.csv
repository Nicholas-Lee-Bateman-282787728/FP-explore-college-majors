Some may find a few jokes or situations a bit harsh, as the main charector plays a disabled man... and i can see why some may get offended, but hey thats why its a movie and supposed to make light hearted humor of sad things like that... the main actor seann scott has always been halirious to me so that made a difference with this one and for me the modern day comdies , im usually 90% saying nope to watching them. I did find this halirious tho.",1507075200,2,481,4.182795698924731

4643885,5,B005BQTUQS,"This movie is one of those brilliantly-done little gems that comes along maybe once in a decade. I realize it's not the type of film that will appeal to the not-so-bright, and that's okay.  It doesn't have to -- it has its audience.

Seann was an adequate choice as the lead, although there are others who would probably have done a better job.  The script could have been somewhat more even, but the structure breakdown almost adds to the genius of the production.

I don't want to make a comparison between this and a literally-brilliant film, but this movie blows light and dark the way American Beauty does.  And because it addresses the human condition on a base level, brighter people will ""get it"" and others won't, which is part of its beauty.

If you're into offbeat films and indies, you'll probably love this.  If, however, you're looking for slob humor or other frat-boy mentality fare, you'll probably want to choose something else.",1479168000,3,945,4.7607361963190185
4643886,2,B005BQTUQS,This movie evoked memories of people you know in your life. It was sometimes unbelievable that someone could be that delusional.,1454544000,,128,5.142857142857143

4643890,3,B005BQTUQS,Decent movie to pass time. Sean William Scott has done better. However the story line is interesting enough to keep you entertained.,1424995200,,132,5.045454545454546

4643898,5,B005BQTUQS,"American Loser is hilarious movie based on the trials and tribulations of a guy who can't seem to catch a break in life.  It has some dramatic points as well, funny and romantic scenes....and about having friends who are supportive.  Found myself laughing and cringing at the same time!  Definitely worth checking out....  ....overall, I really enjoyed it!",1326412800,4,356,5.086206896551724
4643899,1,B005BQTUQS,There's about two hours that I'll never get back. It was painful to watch and never seemed to end.  Watching paint dry or grass grow would have been as beneficial.  Not sure why that story was ever turned into a movie.,1319241600,2,218,4.2926829268292686
4643900,5,B005BQTUQS,"Mr. Nichols has been a personal friend and business associate for the past three years. His disabilities are far worse than illustrated in this movie. He is also far funnier than Mr. Penn depicts.

I highly recommend Mr. Nichol's book, ""Trainwreck: My Life As An Idiot"", which is much better than the movie because his voice comes across more clearly.

If you happen to be in Montauk, NY, book a charter with Captain Nichols. You can find him at [...] Serious fishermen only: drunks need not apply.",1319155200,2,498,4.712643678160919
4643901,5,B005BQTUQS,"I see a lot of movies. About 2 a week and I have very high standards for movies. I'll admit I didn't expect too much from this one but it turned out to be one of my favorites of the year. The lead character, who is based on the life story of a real person, is someone I don't have much in common with and yet I found myself identifying very much. He has a serious learning disability and has occasional psychotic episodes (often about playing basketball with many versions of himself). He has serious problems with organization and low self-esteem. These problem have caused him not to be able to take advantage of all the opportunities he has been given in life such as a great loving family who are well-off.

Many of his errors are hilarious and yet endearing. For example, he finally meets the woman of his dreams but due to his nervous condition and habitual coffee drinking, ends up taking a dump in her bed. That's embarrassing and funny IMHO. He sinks his dad's boat and burns his parent's house down. This hapless fool is endearing because one gets the impression that despite his failures and weaknesses, he is trying his best to make things work and he seems like a descent person. I found myself rooting for this character throughout the film and the film was not cliche or sappy at all. It was just a good, funny, unpretentious film about a normal guy with some serious problems and all his nutty little quarks.",1318636800,7,1424,4.498069498069498
4643902,1,B005BQTUQS,"I really think Seann william Scott is funny, but from one Sean to another Seann (BTW, WTF with the two ""n"" thing?), this was painful!!  Bro., c'mon..........soooo bad.. no momentum.
I'm sitting on my favorite chair, and i just couldn't get comfortable. then i realized it wasn't the chair it was the movie! please do not rent. i have never ever made a review in my life, but felt if i didn't on this one, i would be in violation of the good samaritan law.",1317427200,,455,4.352941176470588
4643903,1,B005BQTUQS,"We are huge Sean William Scott fans and looked forward to a great flick especially since Gretchen Mol is one of the best actresses to be the supporting character. To say we are disappointed is an understatement. I honestly cannot tell you what the plot of this movie is. It was so disjointed, non-sequential, and erratic that there was no rhythm to this movie. It was literally like watching an hour and a half of bloopers from a movie reel.  There were perhaps three humorous scenes in the entire movie only by virtue of Sean William Scott's physical comedy, but that is all. We kept waiting for the movie to make sense as it became worse and worse and at the halfway point we realized with horror that what we were seeing was all there was and that if there was a joke it was on us for spending any money to see this film. Even though Gretchen Mol gave a good performance with the material she had, she also had cringe-worthy scenes were she gets up on a window ledge and sings a cabaret song that was so bad I was surprised the glass in the window behind her did not crack. Another one involves sniffing fecal matter on the bed - yes, you read that right. All I can say is this:  The main character is in Alcoholics Anonymous all the way through the movie and that is a sign that you will have to drink beer to watch this movie - a lot of it - and you may even end up joining AA yourself afterwards. Despite the terrible movie, it appears that the failure of the movie is not the fault of the actors, but is instead the fault of the script, director, and most especially the editing. I give it one star.",1317427200,2,1606,4.228013029315961
4643904,1,B005BQTUQS,Wasn't funny. Wasn't good at all. I kept watching to see if maybe by chance something good would happen. It did! They rolled the credits & the suffering was over.,1317254400,3,162,4.433333333333334
4643905,5,B005BQTUQS,American Loser is a good movie that is based on a great book 'Trainwreck: MY Life as an Idoit' by Jeff Nichols.  Sean William Scott does a passable job in the title role while Jeff Garlin is excellent as his buddy from AA.,1315958400,3,222,4.162790697674419
8464121,1,B005BQTUQS,"I rented this thinking it would be a fun movie where the lead character starts out as a loser and then picks himself up to remake his life.
What I got was a script that tried so hard to be dry and edgy that it told no real story without any real plotline.  The first 20 minutes of the movie was him debating what color shirt to wear.  It was as interesting as it sounds.  This movie was a loser indeed.",1513296000,,402,3.9382716049382718
8464122,1,B005BQTUQS,"The best thing I can say about this movie is that the supporting cast were all great, well cast, and they brought life to their characters.  Stiffler....is still trying to not be Stiffler while he's supposed to be playing other characters.  Either that character stuck to Sean William Scott...or that's the only character he's capable of playing.  It worked in American Pie, but this is a different film.  They should have sent him a memo.

I watched the entire movie in one sitting, barely.  Several times I had to talk myself out of quitting, in hopes that some humor would shine through or some revelation or SOMETHING worth the time I'd already invested in it.  Nothing.

My advice is, if you don't like Sean William Scott playing Stiffler, especially in movies that are not American Pie, skip it.

Spoiler alert:  Gretchen Mol plays her character well, the romantic interest of the Scott's character.  The romance goes absolutely nowhere and the only resolution is a tiny sidenote at the end that informs us their was no happy real-life ending either.  This footnote is a terrible thing to put in the film.  The way the ending is framed makes it appear as though the two may have found happiness together since their characters seemed well matched throughout the film.  The filmmakers even had the nerve to deny me what otherwise seemed a decently happy ending after all the time I wasted watching the whole film.

The character never grows, the movie doesn't go anywhere, and the ""what really happened"" update text at the end ruined an otherwise pleasant end.

Skip it.",1510185600,,1575,4.799256505576208
8464123,1,B005BQTUQS,This film was absolutely horrible. Poorly written script with a great cast. It's a shame the actors didn't have more to work with.,1510012800,,130,4.695652173913044

8464127,1,B005BQTUQS,"I cannot believe I managed to watch all of this movie. The only why this is funny is, if you find watching the young generation of today funny. I have been watching them every day for the past 30 years, and they quit being funny 29 years ago. The acting in the movie is good, and that is the only thing good about it. It is an hour and a half of listening to someone complain about being a loser. I think anyone with any sense, doesn't find today's generation a comedy. I wish I had believed the reviews on this one.",1508112000,,516,4.068627450980392
