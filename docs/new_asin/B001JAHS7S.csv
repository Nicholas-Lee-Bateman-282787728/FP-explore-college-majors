3656014,5,B001JAHS7S,"This show is a very important piece of my, and others', childhoods.  I remember when I watched 'The Fairly Odd Parents' the first few times back in the day, I knew it was going to be one of my top 3 favorite shows of all time forever.  If you are 5, 9, 12, or even older, this show will make you want to watch each episode infinitely.  There is something for everyone in this series.  If you're a fan of fairies, this will definitely satisfy you.  Like outrageous comedy, 'Fairly Odd Parents' surely has fairly odd humor. Lol.  And for pretty much anyone else who's a fan of pixies and geneies will love this show.  Bottom line, if you are looking for a fun time, I highly recommend buying this.  It's the best $20 I have ever spent on a dvd.  I wish this review was helpful to all.  Wow!  How fairly odd that his is one of the best shows.
The only one complaint I have though is that it would have been cool to know what edition of this dvd I was buying (2009 edition with old Nick logo and/or 2011 with new Nick logo).  But I am just glad it works flawlessly. ;)",1347235200,3,1064,4.111650485436893
3656015,5,B001JAHS7S,"The Fairly Oddparents movies and cartoons are excellent for kids of all ages as they contain many life lessons. For example: obtaining every little thing you may wish for may not be the best for you or the outcome of the wishes may not be as wonderful as one had imagined. The Fairly Oddparents are cute and fun. The ""Odds"" are by far the all time favorite in my household. I love 'em.",1319760000,7,385,4.287671232876712
3656016,4,B001JAHS7S,"same slight problem as the others,not sure why,but so far so good, and the dvd's have been playing ok. but again,there were a couple of small scratches,these are brand new,and should have none,but didn't want to have to send this back as well, so hopefully it will play fine forever! thanks again for your continued support.",1285286400,2,324,4.803571428571429
3656017,4,B001JAHS7S,"Fairly Odd Parents season 1 dvd box set without the Oh Yeah Cartoon episodes is a complaint.
Someone leave a message or a note to the Nickelodeon studio or Nicktoons studio about making a FOP DVD with the Oh Yeah Cartoon shorts. I think I have a couple options make another FOP DVD of the 1st season, the first 6 episodes with the Oh Yeah Cartoon episodes or a FOP DVD of the Oh Yeah Cartoon episodes when they were in the actual show and redubbed Timmy's voice to what it sounds like in the first 6 episodes. The person who played Timmy's voice in the actual show was Tara Strong. I really wish they reaired the Oh Yeah Cartoon Episodes or return back to the actual FOP show with the same original airdates, but they're just returning by the time they get released on DVD. The Fairly Odd Parents Oh Yeah Cartoon Episodes atleast have great humor.

Oh Yeah Cartoons does shorts of 2 Nicktoon series Fairly Odd Parents and Chalk Zone.
I love the old Fairly Odd Parents episodes better than the new episodes. It stinks when they got rid the episodes with Oh Yeah Cartoon shorts out of the actual FOP series. They should re-air these episodes just so it would be released on DVD or some other kind of technology such as blue-ray. The original FOP shorts were on another animated series on Nickelodeon called Oh Yeah Cartoons since 1999, these episodes were on the actual FOP series on 2001. The original Fairly Odd Parents episodes are AWESOME!!! (original FOP series, AKA The first 6 episodes and the episodes with Oh Yeah Cartoon shorts, when they were on the actual FOP series).  The FOP episodes with Oh Yeah Cartoon shorts were on the actual FOP series on summer '01 after Nickelodeon aired the first 6 Fairly Odd Parents episodes on Spring of '01 and all of 2002 throughout when Nickelodeon aired Chalk Zone on Spring '02.

History:
Fairly Odd Parents was on Oh Yeah Cartoons on 1999-2000 just like Chalk Zone.
FOP episodes with Oh Yeah Cartoon shorts on the actual Fairly Odd Parents series and air-dates:
- Scout's Honor/Really Bad Day/Super Humor  June 29, 2001
-Fairly Odd Parents/Too Many Timmy's/Fairy Flu  August 24, 2001
-Party of 3/ The Temp/ The Zappy's  August 31, 2001

I love Scouts Honor the best  out of these original FOP episodes!

I miss the original Fairly Odd Parents Series much as I do with Chalk Zone on Nickelodeon!!!
Chalk Zone and Fairly Odd Parents are awesome shows!!!",1259539200,,2399,4.599531615925058
3656018,5,B001JAHS7S,"Nickelodeon has been programming original animated series that appeal to both kids and adults for years now. The writing for the Oddparents is witty and incisive. There are so many famous guest voices like Jay Leno, Norm MacDonald, Method Man, Alec Baldwin, Laraine Newman and even Diana DeGarmo. I started watching this show back in 1998 and fell in love with it. The animation harks back to Chuck Jones. Characters are broadly drawn but the things they say and the situations presented are just so over the top but always funny! I put this on whenever I want to forget about being an adult....it works every time!",1255824000,3,615,4.757009345794392
3656019,4,B001JAHS7S,"The first thing I want to get out of the way is a rant; these DVD's should have been available years ago.  There is frankly no excuse for not releasing an American made cartooon in the United States especially in light of the fact that FOP season DVD's were available in other countries.  That said, there are three good things about these DVD's of the first season of the Fairly OddParents; The picture and sound quality are very high, and they are in production order.  It was enjoyable watching these early episodes.  The only thing that prevented this from getting a higher rating is the fact there are no DVD extras. However, if you simply want the episodes, these DVD's are more than adequate.",1252540800,17,699,4.612903225806452
3656020,1,B001JAHS7S,"This set is about 1 step above a bootleg version.  The picture and sound are clear.  So much for the positive review.

First of all, this set is misrepresented.  Amazon says it's the ""complete"" 1st season.  The DVD cover implies a complete season.  Well, it isn't, not by a long shot.  It includes episodes 1-13. bit omits 14-21.  The technical term for this situation is ""rip-off"".

Speaking of non-inclusion:  the unaired pilot is missing -- something that in any professional commercial production would have been at least a special feature.  Speaking of special features, there are none.  Zilch.  Nada.  Zero.  There isn't even a real menu:  just a choice to ""play all"".  Or see ""episodes"".  Or not.  Thus there is no way to select individual segments of episodes.  There are no subtitles.  There are just plain naked episodes and I suppose we're supposed to be all excited at that miserly offering because Nickelodeon can't be bothered to do some real, professional DVDs.

I don't know what to advise here.  My primarily inclination is to refuse to buy and rip-off collection.  We can still hope that this popular animated series will eventuall receive the DVD presentation it deserves.  Buying this will only encourage the stupids who thought it up.

On the other hand, who's to say that Nikelodeon will ever come to its senses.  It's presented a lot of really good cartoons without ever putting them on DVD.

(By the way, the Season 2 set is more nearly complete.)

Well, it's a piece of trash, but you may need to pay the requisite blackmail just to insure that at least you have these episodes on DVD, no matter now badly produced.",1248825600,19,1640,4.757142857142857

3656032,5,B001JAHS7S,"The Fairly Odd Parents, from Season 1 to 5, was arguably one of the best shows on Nickelodeon. Timmy Turner is an average 10 year old boy who has parents that never spend enough time with him and has to deal with an abusive babysitter. As a result, he has two fairy godparents: Cosmo and Wanda, where he can grant his every wish following Da Rules (Cosmo and Wanda must not be seen by other kids or else they are GONE). Nonetheless, the early episodes were amazing. I am 20 years old, and this show brings so much nostalgia that I cry too in the first episode (The Big Problem) when Timmy is in Jail. I miss those days of when life was easy and I looked forward to an amazing binge on Nickelodeon. It is a lot different from Spongebob, and I actually like FOP more for some reason. Get this DVD and go back to 2001 :)",1446768000,,817,4.144654088050315
3656033,5,B001JAHS7S,"I've been watching this cartoon series since I was a young girl. I've ALWAYS loved it! Been thinking about animating myself as a Fairly Odd Parent character, & posting it on deviantart.com!",1443830400,,189,4.9375
3656034,5,B001JAHS7S,"First of all, when purchasing this set, you should know that these are made-on-demand DVD-R's. Literally, they are made to order. However, I will honestly say that they are very high quality. The picture and sound are both very nice, and all of season 1's episodes are included. Since these are not DVD, but DVD-R, I would recommend that you treat them with great care, as they are not going to be the same quality as a regular DVD, meaning they aren't as resistant to scratches and damage. There are no bonus features in this set, which kind of sucks, but isn't a big deal to me. I almost gave this a 4 star rating for the fact that it's DVD-R format, but since the episodes are in such good quality, I really couldn't tell that these aren't standard DVD's. I'd recommend them to anyone who loves this show, and will continue buying the remaining seasons.",1420243200,6,856,4.493589743589744
