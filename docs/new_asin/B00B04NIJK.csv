5539116,5,B00B04NIJK,"Chow Young Fat is my favorite action star.  He plays the role of a soul seeking redemption from the blood he has spilled as he honors a promise he has made to a wealthy criminal.  I love this movie not because of the action.  I love the sincerity of the actors in their roles. In short,  Humanity is Alive and Well in Cinema.",1409011200,,325,4.111111111111111

5539119,4,B00B04NIJK,"This is should be a cult classic!!!!!!!  Chow Yon Fat and Mira Sporvino sizzle and spark in this thriller and the action is great and very believable.  The stars create a type of romantic tension between them that they wisely never consummate but play out!!!!  This  added to the action and you find yourself wondering will they make it thru to the next scene!!!!  You are rooting for the team before the end of their meeting!!!!  I have always love this movie almost as ""the Last Kiss Goodbye"".

8560092,3,B00B04NIJK,"This Double Feature Blu Ray has labeled The Replacement Killers as the ""Extended Cut"" of the film, but this is actually the shorter Theatrical Cut, which has not been previously released on Blu Ray.  The Replacement Killers has no audio commentary, just DTS 5.1 sound.  Truth or Consequences, N.M. is movie only and has DTS Sound.",1414540800,7,330,4.875
8560093,3,B00B04NIJK,This version of The Replacement Killers is okay but I was hoping it was the extended version that developed the back stories of John and Meg. I found myself missing the cut scenes. Including a couple of extra minutes would have turned this from a good movie into a great movie.,1411948800,2,277,4.450980392156863
