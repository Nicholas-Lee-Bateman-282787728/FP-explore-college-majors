Our family loved it so much when they were visiting and now they are going to order this too for their homes.  We love the beautiful , natural bubble sounds with it the best.  Makes it even more realistic!  So peaceful, it can put me to sleep at night.  .  Best of all, no clean up and no expensive maintenance.  The best of both worlds!  ",1529107200,,491,4.274725274725275

8710194,5,B00VHJL80O,"This 2-disc DVD set provides an incredible array of tropical sea, night, coral, Red Sea, soft coral, and tropical reef aquariums.  You have your pick of piano music, bubbles, or waves to enhance the visual experience.

Disc one has the Tropical Sea, Night, and Coral aquariums.  Both plants and fish are presented in an amazing variety of beautiful colors.  It is like an underwater kaleidoscope unfolding for your senses.  I especially enjoyed the Night aquarium as the interplay of light and shadow was enthralling.

Disc two has the Red Sea, Soft Coral, and Tropical Reef aquariums.  Once again, both plants and fish are astounding.  The colors are vibrant and appear to be in every hue possible.  It is a treat for your eyes.

I think this DVD set is outstanding.  They look wonderful on my HDTV and provide a totally relaxing atmosphere for either at home or in a waiting room setting.  Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite aquarium DVD sets!",1465257600,3,954,4.75
8710195,5,B00VHJL80O,"With this program I enjoy having two discs with three aquariums on each, and all of them have a choice of soundtrack: piano, bubbles or waves in the background.  I find these very soothing and relaxing, especially at the end of the day.

I sometimes play these while reading in the evening, and they are also great to play when I have visitors.  The tanks are very beautiful with rocks and colourful plants as well as the marvellous multicoloured fish.  My favourite fish are the orange ones with black stripes and the lovely pastel pink ones.  It can also be very educational and fun to search for the various names and details of the many types of fish in each aquarium.

The great benefit of these DVDs is that I can have wonderful aquariums without the extensive effort and costs involved in setting up and maintaining such beautiful fish tanks.",1432598400,3,849,4.626666666666667

8710197,5,B00VHJL80O,"The Tropical Aquarium XXL box contains six different aquariums. Each of the video is twenty minutes. In each aquarium you can select which sounds you want to hear. Wave sounds, bubbling or piano music are possible. My favorite video on Disc 1 is the night aquarium. It shows a large cut of an aquarium at night, which is very dark in part, in which you can almost only see the fish. This video is really relaxing, when you hear it with piano music. On the DVDs there is also a beautiful coral aquarium with colorful fish and a soft coral aquarium, where everything is bathed in glorious coral colors. On Disc 2, the Tropical Reef Aquarium is my favorite. There, the fish are all very colorful in pink, yellow and blue. I like this DVD set very much.",1429228800,,749,4.434782608695652
