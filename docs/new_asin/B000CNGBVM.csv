2467475,5,B000CNGBVM,"having watched degrassi since season 2 and learning about everyone from then on, this show is an amazing demonstartion of what teens got through.  This box set is going to sell better than the other 2 because of the fact that it has the one episodes americans did not get to see.  Having only seen it online with a very bad picturee, seeing it on my tv and unedited will be a delight! <33",1138752000,5,388,4.22972972972973

2467477,5,B000CNGBVM,"This has got to be the greatest show on tv.

It deals with real life issues that a teen

today might deal with. if you like tv shows that are true

to life, watch Degrassi.",1136937600,5,172,3.857142857142857
2467478,5,B000CNGBVM,"I watch Degrassi: The Next Generation on The N frequently. The only problem is that the episodes are edited or are completely unaired! There are two episodes on this DVD that were never aired on The N. The episodes deal with abortion so I am guessing that is why there were considered unacceptable to air. This show deals with issues that kids are dealing with today. It hits on topics such as Rape, Cutting, Drugs, Alcohol, Sexual Preferences, etc. You should also check out Degrassi Junior High, it was released in the 1980's and is just as helpful and entertaining at the same time as this is.

2467512,5,B000CNGBVM,I still watch the older seasons now. It kinda brings me back to the days. I really don't watch the newer seasons because I feel as though its starting to repeat itself. I also feel like I can't too much relate to the newer generation (even though when the first episodes came out I was like 7 or 8).,1403654400,,299,4.084745762711864

2467515,5,B000CNGBVM,"I, like some of you, remember when the original Degrassi aired back in the 80's.  I was really sad to see it go and can still remember every bit of the last episode where Caitlin and Joey said goodbye at the wedding of their friends.
When I found The N on cable and saw that there was a new Degrassi I squealed with delight, but nothing made me more happy, but to see Caitlin and Joey on my tv screen again.  If you are a Caitlin and Joey fan it is a must to watch Holiday from season 3.
What always impressed me with Degrassi is their amazing way in which they deal with very tough issues for teens.  The teens on the show are real and not some 90210 or OC characters who look perfect and are like a teen soap.  I would implore parents to sit down and watch the old and new episodes of Degrassi because am sure it would be a great stepping stone to talking about these issues with their kids.
All in all...GREAT TV.",1401580800,,916,4.072222222222222

Now I am catching up! I'm on Season 9 of The Next Generation right now! I'll admit, sometimes the acting is cheesy and so is the script, but Degrassi has ALWAYS HIT THE MAJOR issues that kids deal with! This show is great to help parents get some insight into how to speak with their kids about serious issues they will be presented with at school, and at home. Like internet security, sexuality, cheating in school, peer pressure, STD's and the MANY ways in which they can be transmitted, violence in school, bullying, the list of issues that Degrassi tackles goes on and on.

2467518,3,B000CNGBVM,"Not bad but overall I have noticed with each passing season it's getting farther away from the purpose of the original show.  Way too polished and ""Hollywood.""  I suppose it was inevitable and it's still a good show, but the original is the one I would recommend to today's kids. Much more realistic and relatable.  The actors in the new version are unrealistically attractive--everything is airbrushed and made up.  Even the boys.",1400544000,,431,4.944444444444445

2467520,5,B000CNGBVM,"I know people are less likely to read five star reviews from true fans, so I will keep it brief.  This is the season where Degrassi truly came into its own and began telling more mature stories.  Ellie and Marco are welcome additions to the cast and some strong recurring characters are introduced, especially Dylan Michalchuk.  Perhaps the strongest episode of the season is the season opener, ""Father Figure.""  Although purists and original fans like me could be annoyed that Paige's dad Shane is a recast, the actor does a great job portraying someone with a traumatic brain injury.  For those of you binge watching from the beginning, power through so you can get to this gem of a season.",1396656000,,692,4.733333333333333

2467525,4,B000CNGBVM,"This was a pretty good season of degrassi, maybe not as good as season 2, but still very good. You had a few new characters in this season, Alex, Jay, and Rick. Also the last season with Terri. The only complaint I have is that the storylines seem to lack the intensity they had last season but they weren't bad or anything. The storyline I didn't care for was the whole Craig-Ashley-Manny love/drama triangle, after the great storylines Craig had last season and Jake Epstein's great performance I just couldn't bring myself to care about this one.

2467550,5,B000CNGBVM,"On the 3rd season of Degrassi, here are some things that happen. The two part episode for the beginning starts with Mrs. Simpson about to give birth anyday now, and emma starts wondering about her birth father, so she gets craig to go with her to help her find him. some other things that happen is Manning is getting tired of being cute and wants to be sexy, so she starts to wear more revealing clothing and that brings the attention of J.T. Terri is getting roses on her locker from a secret admirer, but it turns out the secret person is not that sweet. Newcomers Jay and Alex come in and get Sean to join, which causes him to be more rebellious again and so Sean and Emma break up. MR.Simpson gets cancer, so mrs.simpson buys him a laptop to cheer him up but sean steals it. Another newcomer comes in named chris, he is all into hip-hop and hooks up with emma, but emma is not over sean and justs wants to get him into trouble. An old character named Wheels returns and he makes up with Archie
  Marco and Ellie break up and he reveals to spinner that he is gay, everybody else takes it well except for spinner. another newcomer named Dylan who is the older brother of paige is also gay and finds marco pretty attractive. Craig and Ashley are a couple but Craig starts fooling around on her with Manning. Craig,Marco,Spinner and Jimmy start a band called Downtown Sasquatch, and eventually gets in a school music competion against a 4 girl band {Paige,Ellie,Ashley,Hazel}  Ellie gets depressed and starts to cut herself because she cant deal with her mom drinking. One episode copys off the movie the Breakfast Club, where Jimmy,Ellie,Hazel,Toby and Sean get stuck in a saturday detition. Paige,Spinner and Ashley decide to skip school for a day. Paige wants a new locker and spinner does something to humilate her to get it.
Mrs. Simpson, Caitlyn Ryan,Hazel,Marco,Ellie get starting credit on the show. Alex,Jay,Chris,Dylan are the newcomers on the show",1235088000,,1959,4.65606936416185
2467551,5,B000CNGBVM,"In season three of Degrassi: The Next Generation, several of the characters go through some pretty significant changes. As identity becomes a major theme this season, many of the characters go through interesting developments. Some mature and others change for the worse.

Manny changes her physical appearance, which consequently alters her personality as well--causing her to make some careless and irresponsible choices. Marco is finally forced to come out to all his friends about his sexuality. And Spinner, who considered himself one of Marco's closest friends, lashes out when he finds out the truth about his friend.

In addition, we get lots of new romances and relationships this season, including an important love triangle that becomes a major part of season three. The issues are multiplied this season. If you thought season two was drama heavy, season three deals with even more difficult subject matter, which include: homophobia, teen pregnancy, abortion, relationship abuse, and cutting. All of the characters go through major changes this season, as they continue to grow and develop into young adults.

The show is currently entering its eighth season, and yet I still consider season three to be one of the show's best seasons to date. The characters are still growing up and clearly have a lot to learn, and the issues they deal with become more challenging. And yet the show doesn't go overboard with drama, like it does in some of the later seasons. Degrassi is still real and relatable in season three, and the entertainment value is some of the best the show's ever seen.",1216857600,,1597,5.087786259541985

2467554,4,B000CNGBVM,"Being from America, I didn't get to see the famous ""Accidents Will Happen"" episode until I got the DVD.  I must say it was a very good two parter that I've seen more than once.  Before the abortion, we witness Manny going through an image change to get boys attention especially Craig that she couldn't get with the previous season, which is dating emo-goth girl Ashley.  After Craig commits infidelity with Manny she ends up pregnant with his kid that she aborts.  Also another impact storyline is Rick's physical abuse towards Terri, new romances with Sean/Ellie, JT/Manny, Emma/Chris, and Jimmy/Hazel.

Plus you see more relationships break with Sean/Emma and an abusive relationship in Terri/Rick.

The one on Accidents Will Happen is terrible.  However, the one on Pride is awesome.",1155168000,,407,4.45945945945946
2467556,4,B000CNGBVM,"My Season 1 review was constructive criticism of the packaging and the way the DVDs were. Season 2 did get a little better,and they seemed to take some of my advice for Season 3. IR the commentary for Accidents will Happen.

However,Subtitles or even closed captioning are STILL lacking.

With Season 4 having been shot in 16:9 for CTV-HD,it would really be cool if Season 4's DVD were presented in  16:9! Degrassi fans would probobly be receptive to a letterbox presentation.

With the Jay/SB Disc in 4:3 :( I am not getting my hopes up.",1149033600,,538,4.631578947368421
2467557,5,B000CNGBVM,"This was the peak of Degrassi's career. Season 3 was by far the best season of Degrassi: The Next Generation. If there's one season to have on DVD it's this one. Anything after season 3 is garbage in my opinion and anything before it just doesn't measure up. Seasons 4 and 5, when they do come out on DVD, are not worth the money because there just not as good. If someone were to ask me why i liked Degrassi or what made it such a kickass show, all I would have to do is give them this dvd. Season 3 covers so many teen issues without going overboard like seasons 4 and 5. Here's a list of things to expect:

Cutting

Teen Pregnancy

Abortion

Abuse

Cheating

Homophobia

The list goes on.

Buy this dvd if you enjoy watching teens portrayed in a realistic way.",1145577600,5,763,4.213793103448276
2467558,4,B000CNGBVM,"ill agree with the above poster to say that yes, buy it if you're a huge fan and want to add it to your collection, if you're buying it for the features, DON'T. The deleted scenes only includes just over 30 versus season 2's 130, no bloopers, no casting auditions (jay, alex, chris, amy anyone?)",1144281600,,295,4.381818181818182
2467559,3,B000CNGBVM,"Don't get me wrong, I love Degrassi, but I'm not going to say this DVD set is great just because of that. For starters, you can view these episodes on TV for the price of satelite TV (if you live in the states). Most of us buy the DVD sets for what we can't see on TV: The extras! Well, the extras were incredibly lame on this set. They didn't include bloopers and the commentaries were terrible. I'm sorry, but I couldn't care less about the politics of the writers, how many children they have or whether or not they like Madonna. I'm listening for tidbits about the show and the actors. Someone needs to inform the writers exactly what should be in a commentary. Any time you have more writers than actors in a commentary you're asking for trouble, in my opinion. I'd say, if you just want to see the extras, rent instead of buy. But if you want this for your collection, at least it doesn't cost as much as Season 2.",1143763200,2,920,4.2628571428571425
2467560,5,B000CNGBVM,"I LOVE Degrassi but I can't help to feel a bit strange about the two missing episodes.  It sort of feels like the male producers decideded it would be cool to see all of the young actresses in leotards, matronly leotards at that.  I felt it was iky!!! All of the actresses are beautiful with beautiful bodies but I don't understand the point of having a gymastics team materialize out of the blue.  The obvious cuts between real gymnists and the actresses was just plain cheesy!!!  I guess I was expecting more out of the two missing episodes.  I have a new low found respect for Ashley because of the way she announced to the entire school cafeteria the pregnancy of Many & Craig.  I also felt that there may have been some doubt as to who the father is because Manny was chummy with Sulley also remember....

Hazel's line ""I just did a back walkover that belonged in a horror movie"" is pretty hilirious & disgusting.",1143676800,2,918,4.461077844311378
2467561,5,B000CNGBVM,"Heyy... well i guess you could say I'm addicted to degrassi. It faces real life situations that happen to teenagers in everyday lives without the overdose of drama.  I have learned so much from this show and it has really prepared me for my teenage years, from emmas internet encounter to when dean rapes Paige, or realizing your real idenity,abuse, diseases, little mistakes that can change your life and just about rumors gossip and lies. Its covers just about everything during your teenage years.  Its really great for people 12-18 i guess you can say. Im addicted to this show but i suggest if you want to watch it you try to watch all the seasons before just jumping right in because you won't fully understand and ecspecially since the-n jumps randomly all over the seasons when replaying old episodes So try to watch the 1st, 2nd and 3rd season before jumping in to the new season April 7th. Its pretty addicting me and my best friend LOVE this show and so do alot of other peple even they haven't seen all the seasons or episodes. Its an addicting show and you'll probably fall in love with it after the first 5 minutes",1143244800,,1128,4.551724137931035

It is an amazing season of the show. The seasons are only getting better in time. I hope i get mine on the day its released.,1140825600,,312,3.536231884057971
2467563,5,B000CNGBVM,"It is pretty difficult to describe the television show 'Degrassi: The Next Generation' in just a few sentences, you have to experience it yourself. On the outside it is you're typical teen soap opera/drama in the tradtion of such favorites as 'Dawson's Creek' and 'The O.C.' But what makes Degrassi a higher quality show than those others is the heart, tenderness, and believability that the show provides to it's audience.

  At its center 'Degrassi' has a cast of extremely gifted young actors who don't play their characters as the sterotypical jocks, geeks, etc. that one sees in other shows. Though many of the characters have roles that would only require that amount of energy to make them sterotypical they go above and beyond to create realistic people that resemble not the James Van Der Beeks or Adam Brodys that we see in other shows, but real live people who we grew up with in high school. The writing and direction of the show is of an excellent caliber and continues again and again to surprise with the increasing quality of each passing episode.

  In the thrid season of the show (in my opinion the best season) plots that began back in season two emerge into greater importance and the students of Degrassi Community School must deal with crises that mimic almost exactly what every high school in the world at one point or another has to go through.

  The bottom line is that 'Degrassi: The Next Generation' is an outstanding show and one that no one can watch without feeling affected. Though some may think because this is the newest series in a long line of popular shows in the eighties and ninties (and some may think that it couldn't be as good as the originals) one should watch it and see for themselves the quality of the show is equal (and in some cases better) than the original 'Degrassi.'",1140566400,9,1823,4.671875

8099792,3,B000CNGBVM,"By this point, the series had pretty much become unwatchable for me.  I had seen everything since the original late-1970s short films, and finally had enough off all the punk- and macho- posturing.  The show no longer feels Canadian.  It feels like an import representing Chicago or New York City or someplace where the students are routinely packing handguns and going psycho and forming gangs and such.  The few normal and decent characters that were the original backbone of this show have either been brushed aside or have been gradually transformed into the stereotypical moody, surly, delinquent-style toughs.  It's a shame.  In honesty, the show is watchable, just like one would instinctively gawk at a traffic crash or a train wreck, but is has become too overburdened with painful melodrama to be entertaining anymore.  The best character and actor used to be Ryan Cooley, as J.T. Yorke, before they had him and everyone else go through all that substance use and deviance junk.  Argh.  There's only so long I want to watch young people making the same stupid mistakes and turning into stereotypical macho thugs.  All the emphasis on the bully and thug-like characters really turned me off.  Oh, but they did put in an overtly gay character, who seems just as stereotypical to me as anyone else - only using a different set of gender roles.  This season felt so oppressive and depressing to me that I simply stopped watching the whole show.  Instead of representing good, ordinary, clean Canadian kids, these characters now feel just like those in American shows.  I miss the distinctive Canadiana, and the general sense of wholesomeness or at least goodness that used to represent the Degrassi brand.  For shame.  I just hope people are successfully learning whatever lessons they are supposed to from all of this, because as a decent, law-abiding, non-substance-using person, it has really turned me off.  Decent young people need to see other decent young people, not yet another show overflowing with punks and goons and sociopaths!  Yecch!",1471392000,,2054,5.0266272189349115
