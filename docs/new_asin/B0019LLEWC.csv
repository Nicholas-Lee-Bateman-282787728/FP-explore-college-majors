3438737,4,B0019LLEWC,"I am a big fan of Cooks Illustrated and America's Test Kitchen and have purchased several of their cookbooks. I like to watch the shows and feel like I learn a lot from them. Unlike a lot of cooking shows which just go through making a particular recipe, these programs are more general and teach techniques which can be used not only for the dishes they demonstrate but also to make other similar things.

Since I found that all the seasons are available on DVD at my local public library, I have been going through them again from the beginning. It turns out that Season 8 is one of my favorites. Different seasons seem to have different themes and this season focuses on more traditional home cooking. For example, there is a lot of beef. We see beef burgundy and beef stroganoff. There is a discussion of cooking thick steaks. There is a beef tenderloin dinner. There's even a grilled beef hamburger. Other meats are covered, too. I  liked their solution for making barbecued pork chops indoors year round. There's a good technique which combines oven and stove top for quick roast chicken and potatoes. There are several baked pasta dishes and a couple of stir fries. There is a nice pepperoni pizza. As for deserts, there is a lemon layer cake and a nice French-style apple tart among the baked goods.

With sequences from 26 shows included in this set, there is much more than I can describe here but almost everything is standard home cooking. I really enjoyed watching these shows and I will be returning to them again. I certainly expect to be more successful in the future with some of the dishes presented.

The only slight flaw is this set for me in all these older seasons is in the inclusion of some product and equipment reviews which are now a bit out of date. Some of the kitchen equipment they review is no longer for sale as newer models come out and older models are discontinued. Likewise, some food products they recommend are not available in my area.",1345507200,,1975,4.586402266288951
3438738,4,B0019LLEWC,"I have really been enjoying this DVD! The host and the cooks all seem very kind and friendly, which makes the show pleasant to watch. I have made the pepperoni pan pizza recipe, the low fat brownies, and the four cheese lasagna with great success. None of the recipes that I've tried have been overly time consuming. The one negative is that the DVDs on this season do not come with printable recipes and a paid subscription is required to view recipes online. As such, I practice my handwriting skills and write down the interesting recipes while watching. That is why my review is four stars instead of five. All in all, it is a reliable show.",1343347200,,645,4.521367521367521
3438739,4,B0019LLEWC,"Lots to like here in a cooking show that is highly instructive and blends its entertainment value thru the food and the cooking technique process.  There are no catch phrases or in-your-face personalities; rather the food takes center stage with second billing going to the efforts to design and create the recipes.  Even if the recipe itself is not to your tastes, there is always some very good instruction and some interesting techniques that may very well find themselves into your repertoire.

It's not perfect.  I feel like many of the ethnic foods tend to be watered down, in particular, the Mexican/Tex-mex tend to be pretty blase.

By biggest gripe about this DVD set (and not the TV show) is that it is not anamorphic.  So on an HD TV, this dvd shows up with bars on the top as well as the sides unless you mess with the zoom (in which case you get a muddy image).  Shame on PBS for releasing a DVD like this. I haven't seen a non-anamorphic DVD in about 10 years, I think.",1301184000,7,983,4.4581005586592175
3438740,5,B0019LLEWC,"We love this series.  It is very helpful to not just have a recipe, but to watch someone cooking it.  We have the companion book but love the dvd more",1283644800,,150,3.966666666666667
3438741,4,B0019LLEWC,"The shows are excellent.  I found the quality of the production to be very good.  The recipes are great, the episodes are fun to watch and they are often humorous.  I personally would prefer more cooking and less equipment and product taste testing, but that is just a personal preference.

[Note: There are no recipes included on these DVD's - of any season - until Season 9.  Season 9 does have recipes.  Presumably they will be included in future editions, as well.  Clearly they wanted to sell the recipes either in the companion book or online, so it is to their credit they have started including the recipes on the DVD's.  Also, there seem to be parts of episodes missing from the DVD's that were part of the actual season.  The web site has all the episodes listed with each and every recipe they did.]

I have copies of all seasons and I would recommend them in spite of these issues because they are very helpful, instructive, and fun to watch.

You can get all old seasons on their web site for 50% off and with quite reasonable shipping costs.",1262995200,2,1055,4.5
3438742,5,B0019LLEWC,"Season 8 is one of the very best seasons of ATK. You will never make a bad dinner or get a useless recipe from ATK. Some of my favorite Season 8 recipes include: Kansas City BBQ (a lot of work but it's well worth it), Asian Take-Out at Home (this includes 2 easy recipes) and Pepperoni Pizza (this is also a lot of work, but very well worth it). You can find all of these recipes on their Site as well. Often what I do is print up the recipe and read it as I watch the DVD and then pause it for extra time (they're so fast). The only recipes I wasn't crazy about were the Indian dishes, but that's more because of personal preference. Everything else was as usual excellent. I recommend this set to anyone who is either expanding their kitchen library or to anyone who is starting to get acclimated in domestic culinary arts for the first time.",1222387200,9,844,4.216049382716049
3438743,4,B0019LLEWC,If you like the show you will like this DVD. The menu lets you pick the receipe or reveiw you want without having to fast forward through the show (an improvment from previous DVD's). Why not 5 stars? The DVD package is cheap compared to the previous DVD's.,1216684800,8,257,4.375
