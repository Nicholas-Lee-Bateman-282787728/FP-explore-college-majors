8326882,5,B001NG4236,"IN LOVE WE TRUST begins as a conventional soaper with a sick child whose parents soon learn that this child has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. Director Wang Xiaoshua chooses to avoid conventional drama and instead steers the plot toward the adults. First we learn that the child HeHe (Zhang Chuqian) has not been raised by her biological parents. The mother Mei Zhu (Liu Weiwei) divorced the father Xiao Lu four years earlier. He has since remarried to Dong Fan (Yu Nan). Mei Zhu is now married to Xiao Lei and they now raise HeHe. The four adults are decent folk with all concerned reasonably satisfied in their respective marriages. Dong Fan, however, wants a child of her own and is unwilling to accept the excuses of Xiao Lu who does not wish any more children in his life. The problem begins with HeHe's illness. It is as if the need for a sibling has ripped apart the lives of four adults. We see HeHe in the hospital. She is a lovely child and her loveliness serves to underscore the brutal choices that all four must unwillingly confront.

First, Mei Zhu must ask her ex-husband to donate his sperm for artificial insemination. He is reluctant but gives in, knowing that HeHe's life is at stake. Then Xiao Lu must convince his current wife to go along with the process. Dong Fan is bitterly opposed but in the end she gives in to the inevitable conclusion that her husband has no choice. Mei Zhu's husband does not like the idea either but he agrees for the same reason. And it is right here that director Wang Xiaoshuai presents the stark theme that the inevitability of any crisis is a function of how desperate the players are. As long as the pregnancy can be achieved via artificial insemination, then all concerned can tell each other that the mumbo-jumbo wizardry of technology does not permit the reality of birth to intrude too closely. There is an awkward scene in which Xiao Lu is taken to a small room to donate sperm. Lying prominently on the table is a semi-nude picture of a woman whose presence is meant as a lure toward a successful sperm collection. The failure of this method ups the ante of how far are the four willing to go. There is a second awkward scene in which Mei Zhu sees her period and now knows that she must find another way. This ""other"" way is the natural way involving lovemaking. It is here that the desire to preserve one life must be balanced by others who may have tolerated a non-sexual impregnation but balk at a more conventional approach. Of the four, it is Mei Zhu who is absolutely determined to proceed with the pregnancy. The other three either co-operate or leave. She herself admits that this is the height of selfishness on her part, but she is past the point of caring. And it is at this point that the inner significance of the title emerges. The love that we normally trust to carry us through some bitterly contentious times may be insufficient even for a supremely motivated woman like Mei Zhu to succeed unless the others change enough to recognize that for some people a choice is no choice at all. The ending which I shall not reveal here says this better than any other film I have ever seen.",1407801600,2,3183,4.526041666666667
8326883,5,B001NG4236,"China's harsh one child policy is the background to this movie.  By now there are millions of sad and painful stories that could be told about it.  The characters in this movie are unusually adaptive to their crisis situation.  All 4 main characters are sympathetic and well acted.  The mother is strong willed in trying to save her sick child.  While appearing physically somewhat fragile her determination is steely as are her eyes when another character hesitates to cooperate in her plan.

It occurred to me that this story could have been done very badly with an exploitive script.  Instead I felt it was told humanely.  I hope it helps lead to a Chinese change of policy.  If they don't do it for humane reasons they may have to do it for economic reasons.  The policy is leading to an aging population where there will not be enough young to support the elderly. (Sound familiar?) This is already causing a new set of painful stories, particularly among the poor. Perhaps that is the director's next story.",1359072000,,1013,4.704545454545454
8326884,4,B001NG4236,"First things first, I am a big fan of the Film Movement DVD library of foreign and indie movies, releasing these films in the US that otherwise would never find an audience here.

""In Love We Trust"" (2008 release from China; 115 min.) stars off rather confusingly, or better said misleadingly. We follow a married couple as they are dealing with the illness of their young daughter. As the movie develops in the first half four, we get a clearer picture of the overall situation: this is in fact a mother and stepfather, and the biological father (who also is remarried) is drawn into the picture. The young girl needs a marrow boon transplant and the best possible match is from a sister or brother. It puts the married couples into an emotional dilemma: can/will the original parents, now both remarried, get together again with the purpose of having another child so that their daughter can survive long-term? What a premise! I don't want to spoil the plot any further, you'll just have to see how it all plays out, although I will say that it is worth your while.

The movie develops slowly, and I mean that as a compliment. This is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare. I finally crossed the line not long ago and have started my subscription to Film Movement, and now am getting a new foreign/indie movie every month. Best decision ever! Shoul've done this years ago. Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a good foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this. ""In Love We Trust"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1338940800,,1514,4.62453531598513
8326885,4,B001NG4236,"This is a good drama movie; main plot is about two divorced couple (who has since remarried) are reunited after their daughter in common is diagnosed with leukemia. After many unsuccessful treatment, the mother resorts to having another child in hope of using the cord blood to match for a bone marrow transplant. She first tries being inseminated, but after three failed attempts, she finally resorts to sleeping with her ex-husband.

At first, the movie seemed like it was focus on the child and how the mother is willing to go all out to protect and heal her. But as the story develops, it's focus is on the adults and the mental stress they have to go through to save a child.

The four primary actors did an excellent job of using their body language to convey lot of messages without dialog. For example, in one scene, the mother is shown flushing the toilet with red substance shortly after trying to be inseminated, and experiences an emotional breakdown. The mother's new husband can come across as ""unreal"" as it can be very hard for any husband to put up and accept the fact that their wife purposely slept with their ex-husband just for the fact to have a baby. And, the husband goes further and tells her afterwards that he's willing to raise it and accept the future baby as his own even though the wife never tells him that she slept with the ex-husband.

The movie ending was the weakest point. I felt the movie just suddenly dropped when we see the ex-couple goes back to their respective home and have dinner. The husband has dinner with his new wife without any words, and the wife goes home and has dinner with her husband. There's no mention of their relationship after, and no mention if she is pregnant or if the cord blood was able to save the daughter. This should have been some closure to this matter, as this was the focal point of the movie and the main plot that brought the ex's back together for another one-night stand.",1323993600,3,1952,4.5397727272727275
8326886,3,B001NG4236,"(1.) Four stars for the subject matter: presentation of ideas, points and counterpoints on issues of marriage and child bearing in modern China; on issues of marriage faithfulness; and to what extent does a moral dilemma force one to violate some moral beliefs in order to sustain another moral belief.
(2.) Four stars for the pace, tone, setting and acting within the movie. A very simple, clear and convincing presentation by all involved.
(2.) Two stars for the weak resolution of dilemmas and for the movie closure. Special features were inadequate. Needed were better biographies of the crew; a discussion of the dilemmas; a discussion of family values in modern China. One is left with an empty, uncertain feeling as an unintended consequence of the producers wanting an open ended, finish it yourself denouement.",1254787200,3,819,5.119402985074627
8326887,4,B001NG4236,"No surprise to learn director Xiaoshuai Wang studied painting before becoming a director. This is a marvelously composed film. The screenplay is brutal sharp with one large unnecessary gimmick toward the end. I'm glad this theme (see the product description) was done art-house and not commercial melodrama, which it could easily be. The four main performers are solid and compelling, with lots of shots of faces on bodies doing nothing but carrying burden within. And they all pull it off. This is a film with talent coming from every direction, but it is the indie/art-house type. If you partake of that ilk, you'll like this.",1250553600,2,628,4.9904761904761905
