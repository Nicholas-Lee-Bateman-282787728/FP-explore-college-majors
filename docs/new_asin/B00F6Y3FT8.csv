5968829,5,B00F6Y3FT8,"Some films come in like a hurricane, devouring us with frame after frame of intended poignancy.  Other films take their time to develop something that feels soft and languid and subtly envelopes the audience into a story they cannot shake because it feels so authentic, so lived in and so honest.

The opening frames to `Ain't Them Bodies Saints' shows two sun-kissed lovers, Ruth and Bob, as they have an unidentified argument and Ruth threatens leaving.  Bob offers to walk her to her mothers, since it is too far for her to walk on her own.  In his playful, pleading, loving manner he wins her back without much of a fight and she falls into his arms,  pretending to struggle yet you know that she is more than willing to take him back and forget this ever happened.

Besides, she's pregnant.

Thus starts with beautiful and haunting tale of love in the midst of adversity, some self-made and others heaped upon you by forces unknown.  In the next few minutes their life spirals out of control in small vignettes that give us just enough information to keep the focus of this film clear.  Circumstances surrounding a lot of what happens is left open-ended, ambiguous and detail-light.  This way we continue to set our sights on the important things; like Ruth and Bob's relationship.  A botched `job' sends Ruth, Bob and their semi-adopted brother into hiding in the home Bob and Ruth share.  As police fire rings overhead, the three try and work out a gameplan, but shots are exchanged, death corrodes the atmosphere and both Ruth and Bob are taken into custody.

This is where the guts of the film come to bare their soul.

Bob is taken to prison, while Ruth is let off to raise her daughter on her own.  The two correspond as much as they can through letters, but when Bob escapes prison things become complicated.  Bob obviously wants to return home to collect his wife and child, but the police are extra alert to activity in the area and are determined to bring him down.  Things become even more complicated when one of those police officers, Patrick Wheeler, becomes emotionally attached to Ruth and her daughter.  Ruth's confusion over her own feelings and what she deems best for her daughter makes matters much worse, especially when Bob starts to reach out to her, suggesting they run off together.

With hints of `Romeo + Juliet' laced in a package that resembles early Malick, David Lowery's `Ain't Them Bodies Saints' is a real treasure.  From a technical angle, this film thrives in worn set pieces and clothes and facial expressions that are basked in such beautiful light one can't help but feel endeared to them.  The film's visual structure reminded me a lot of `Badlands' and `Days of Heaven', early Malick where the grit of the atmosphere was embellished by the lustful camera lens.  But that isn't where the similarities end.  `Aint' Them Bodies Saints' carries with it a deeply rooted overlay of emotions and character developments that are subtle and simple and expressed through sequences of few words and heavy atmospheric tones that are brought to life by an array of factors; from the score to the cinematography to the astounding performances that grace every single frame.

This says a lot to the strength of the director.  I'm in love with this new wave of directors who are more concerned with telling a story well than with delivering easily digestible moneymakers.  Look at Steve McQueen for example.  His films are difficult, artistic and have value.  I've only seen this one film from David Lowery, but if this any indication then he's going to be one to watch.

Casey Affleck, complete with his cool demeanor, and Rooney Mara are excellent as the lovers torn asunder by circumstance.  Their chemistry, even when they are apart (which is the majority of the film) is beautiful and really speaks to the core of the film.  If you didn't believe they were that deeply affected by their own love for one another, this film would not work, but you shiver at the sight of Mara's own tears.  The pair of supporting players in Ben Foster and Keith Carradine are the real joys here though.  Their intentions serve as a foundation for the film's action, and they both carry their tortured centers with such authenticity.  Ben Foster is especially effective in his interactions with Mara, and his ""I only see good"" speech brought me to tears.

It was embarrassing, but I owned it.

Love is a tricky thing, and time passes in a way that can either strengthen or dampen that love, but more than anything else, time can wizen us up to what that love has done to us.  With both Bob and Ruth, time has deepened their resolve to do what is best for their futures, but their lives have spiraled into two separate directions and so their ideas of the future are drastically different.",1380499200,20,4805,4.711377245508982

5968831,5,B00F6Y3FT8,"Writer/director David Lowery has gathered a superb cast of actor to explore a rather simple story, a cinematic folksong in the western sense (the film is set in the 1970s but could easily be timeless so far reaching are the themes): quite simply it is the tale of an outlaw who escapes from prison and sets out across the Texas hills to reunite with his wife and the daughter he has never met.

Bob Muldoon (Casey Affleck) and his wife/girlfriend Ruthie Guthrie (Rooney Mara) and their kin Freddy (Kentucker Audley) have been `raised' by a man named Skerritt (Keith Carradine) and are bank robbers. In their latest attempt Freddy is killed and Ruthie shoots at and wounds Sheriff Patrick Wheeler (Ben Foster), but to protect his pregnant wife Bob takes the blame and is sent to prison for four years. Bob writes Ruth daily and longs to be reunited with her and their new daughter Sylvie and escapes the prison by cajoling a guard. Escaping means walking and hitchhiking with a young lad named Will (another impressive turn for Rami Malek). Bob finds a Gilead with Sweetie (Nate Parker) but is determined despite the odds to walk his way back to Ruthie as he had promised. Ruthie meanwhile is making do, raising Sylvie on her own, has been given a house by Skerritt, and is courted by the Sheriff she shot (he does not know that the shooter was Ruthie). There is as much silence in the film as there is dialogue, the characters meditating on the fragility of love and the sense of unpredictable fate. The ending is deeply moving.

Bradford Young provides the hypnotic cinematography, allowing the story to unfold gradually (if a bit too long under Lowery's direction). The musical score by Daniel Hart adds enormously to the overall mood of this film. Set in the bleak stretches of Texas hill country the music mixes folk traditions with simple sound of single instruments and songs in a manner most conducive to underling the story. The performances are all memorable, but it is that of Rooney Mara who likely will be in the running for awards. But foremost it is the concept and the technique of cinematic experimental excellence that makes this film a jewel, the work of an important new artist in David Lowery.

5968832,3,B00F6Y3FT8,"We start with a young couple in the throes of a spat. She's leaving him and he's begging her to stay. By the time she relents, she also admits that she is pregnant. THEN we see him trying to steal money so their future will be easier. Within the first ten minutes he and a friend have committed a crime and become fugitives. The accomplice is killed, he is captured and goes to jail. Now the story begins.

Our 2013 Seattle International Film Festival audience wasn't familiar with work by director David Lowery, so we went into this with open minds.

We see:
  * Casey Affleck (""Gone Baby Gone"") as our anti-hero. He does bad things but we can't help but root for him. He writes his lover every day and plots to escape prison.
  * Rooney Mara (""The Social Network"") is his sweetheart, raising their little girl by herself in a sleepy, lazy Texas town.
  * Keith Carradine (""Cowboys and Aliens"" but many of us have loved him since ""Nashville"") is the father of the dead accomplice. He runs a general store in that little town and tends to hold a grudge.
  * Ben Foster (""3:10 to Yuma"" 2007) is a local lawman. He has a major crush on that pretty woman with the darling daughter and brings her an undersized guitar for her third birthday.

The gloomy soundtrack feeds our sense of foreboding; much of the action takes place at night, so not only are WE confused, but the characters are a bit muddled as well.

This will probably be R-rated when the MPAA takes a look at it; I have no idea where they came up with the name for this film. Which brings me to another observation: if you have ANY sort of hearing loss, you will probably do well to see this in a theater that provides closed captions or wait for the DVD from Amazon.",1379548800,8,1727,4.345794392523365

5968842,4,B00F6Y3FT8,"Decent indie drama, with a heartbreaking ending.
I found the story slightly clich, yet good enough for me to give it 4 solid stars.
Casey Affleck, Rooney Mara, and Ben Foster played their characters perfectly.
Although, I think Casey Affleck has an annoying voice and Ben Foster usually playas characters you love to hate.
It was finally nice to see Keith Carradine in a movie, who I remember from the 1980's films made by Alan Rudolph.

The movie is basically about a young couple in love who engage in criminal activity (sort of a Bonny & Clyde kind of a thing).
One night a robbery goes wrong, and the couple find themselves surrounded by the local cops, a shootout breaks out and
one of the cops (Ben Foster) gets shot. Bob (Casey Affleck) gets send to jail, his pregnant girlfriend Ruth (Rooney Mara) gets off easily,
gives birth to the child, and awaits the return of Bob...

SPOILER ALERT:
The only part of the movie I did not get, was--- who was the person that hired the bounty hunters?
Was it Skerritt the shop owner? Patrick the cop? Ruth the girlfriend? or was it somebody else, and the fact is kept obscure for a reason.",1407196800,,1133,4.521951219512195

5968854,4,B00F6Y3FT8,"By the time I got around to seeing this film in a theater, it was already gone, so this Blu ray copy will have to serve the purpose.  Young director/writer David Lowery has managed to assemble a remarkably good cast in this dusty tale of outlaw romance set in central Texas.

Bob Muldoon (Casey Affleck) is a local boy who is in a romantic pairing with Ruth Guthrie (Rooney Mara).  Together with Freddy (filmmaker Kentucker Audley), the trio are robbers and thieves.  The story doesn't delve too deeply into this element but during a foiled robbery, Ruth and Bob retreat to their home where they are involved in a shootout with law enforcement.  Ruth manages to wing one of the deputies (Ben Foster) but Bob accepts responsibility and quickly surrenders.

A theme that runs throughout the film is the passionate love between Bob and Ruth.  In a great scene, shortly after they are captured and cuffed, they walk out to the awaiting police cars bumping and rubbing on each other.  Clearly aware, they will not likely be together again anytime soon, this will be their last physical contact.  This is fine directing and acting.  This emotion is important to the content of the film.  In contrast, we get bits and pieces of letters they send to each other later.  Both, likely high school dropouts, are eloquent writers.

Bob is sent to prison, but a pregnant Ruth is acquitted.  Her adaptive father, Skerritt (wonderful performance by Keith Carradine), allows Ruth and her daughter to live in one of his rental houses.  After 4 years, Bob manages to escape from prison and keeping his word, comes to reunite with Ruth and meet his daughter.  But the law and apparent bounty hunters suspect as much and await his return.  This includes Deputy Wheeler (Foster), the man Ruth actually shot.  Wheeler, clearly cares for Ruth and her daughter but she manages to keep him at bay, still in love with Bob.

This film is beautifully shot by Bradford Young with hazy muted scenes, often focused from a low angle.  The sets seem perfect for a 1970's Texas although the movie was shot in Shreveport, LA.  The story is simple, but the technical achievements are worth noting as well as the convincing portrayals by the cast.  I believe this is Rooney Mara's most compelling performance so far in her young career.  She has the Texas drawl down pat and delivers a nuanced character with emotion and fervor.  Some will feel the film too depressing and too slow.  And I would agree, it does languish on occasion.  I would have also liked to have seem a bit more background as to why our couple decided on a life of crime to begin with.  Still this is a beautifully made film both technically and artistically.  A very Terrence Malick-like feel.

The Blu ray disc has a 1080p transfer and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  As noted earlier it looks terrific.  Shot with 35mm film, often in low light, the picture can occasionally be constrained but I believe this is intentional and not the problem with the transfer.  I saw no issues in that regard.  It had excellent contrast and good skin tones.  The audio has a couple options.  There is a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and an uncompressed PCM 2.0.  This isn't a movie that is going to challenge surrounds but there are a few scenes involving gunfire that make good use of the effect.  I also like the musical soundtrack to this film (Daniel Hart) and thought it played clearly throughout.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Here are the extras:

*Untitled Ross Brothers Documentary (SD, 13:22)
*Deleted Scenes (HD, 8:59)
*The Lights (HD, 3:32): A music video by Keith Carradine.
*Behind the Scenes (HD, 4:48)
*Trailer (HD, 2:29)
*Bob Muldoon Teaser (HD, 00:53)
*Ruth Guthrie Teaser (HD, 00:48)
*Color Bars (HD, 2:53): Includes some bloopers and outtakes.
*St. Nick (SD, 1:24:44): Lowery's undistributed 2009 feature.

Here is a review of ""St. Nick"" included in this package:

3.5 Stars:  This is a nice surprise and an added extra to the ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"" film on Blu ray.  It was director/writer David Lowery's first film.  The film was shot mostly in and around Fort Worth and won Lowery some awards at various film festivals.  ""St. Nick"" almost serves as a prequel of sorts to his larger film from 2012.

In this film we have a boy of about 12 and a girl of about 9.  The siblings are only referenced as The Boy and The Girl and are played by Tucker and Savanna Sears.  They appear to be running away from home but we don't know why.  They take shelter in a dilapidated and empty house, crawling through a broken window.  The house isn't in some remote area, it is in a neighborhood, albeit a run down one.  The kids appear to be well cared for.  The Boy even has braces, which interestingly, he removes using some wire cutters.  The pair scrounge for food, dumpster diving, shoplifting and the girl even stumbles upon a girl's birthday party and invites herself for cake.

When they are discovered and kicked out by the owner of the home, they take shelter in an abandon church in a more rural setting, having trekked some distance with their belongings packed in a large sack.  There's not much of a plot, but we keep asking ourselves why they are leaving.  An argument, parental discourse, abandonment, foster home?  We don't know until the end and it's not what we might fear.

Along the way, Lowery and his cinematographer Clay Liford show a remarkable vison of the children's flight.  Shot mostly with hand-held cameras the look is intriguing.  The film has very little dialog, mostly when the kids engage adults.  ""St. Nick"" isn't a great film but a fascinating one and shows the promise of Lowery's insight and filmmaking.  A terrific bonus to an excellent Blu ray package.",1394582400,,5741,4.701807228915663

What is incredibly disappointing is the audio and picture quality of the blu-ray. The darks are muddy to the point where what should be smooth gradients are blotchy and washed out.

5968876,3,B00F6Y3FT8,It takes a lot of build to get to the good part.. But we still enjoyed it. Great acting for roony Mara and Casey affleck.,1388448000,,121,3.88
5968877,5,B00F6Y3FT8,"This was a great movie and the acting by Affleck and Mara was impeccable! There is a lot that is unsaid but understood between the characters so if you like/need a lot of dialogue you may want a different movie. The performances were amazing and the story kept me hooked the whole time. There was a little bit of everything like action, suspense, romance, and drama. I would have loved for the movie to be 20 minutes longer and to see more of Mara and Affleck in the same scenes together, but neither was needed to make it a very emotional and powerful movie. This has got to be one of my favorite indie movies! I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an emotional drama with great acting.",1388188800,,690,4.3984375

I like dramas that are emotional.  I waited with anticipation for the movie to finally be available for instant stream.  What a disappointment.  The story was very shallow.  I could barely understand Casey Affleck's slow, monotone, speech.  I usually like him.  Rooney Mara, not impressive.  I like Ben Foster.  I watched this movie yesterday and barely remember it.  The story was not deep.  The characters were shallow.",1387411200,4,580,4.68

5968881,2,B00F6Y3FT8,"This is a movie that is inside an artistic, dreamy fog. Therefore its difficult to follow and to make matters worse the lead actors often garble the dialogue.

5968888,3,B00F6Y3FT8,"""I promise I'll come back and get you."" Bob Muldoon (Affleck) and Ruth Guthrie (Mara) are young and in love. Bob is an outlaw who makes is living illegally. When he finds out Ruth is pregnant he promises her one last job and then he will stop. When the job goes wrong him and Ruth end up trapped. Sacrificing himself he turns himself in with a promise to come back for her. When she begins to develop feelings for the cop that is assigned to her case her life becomes complicated, even more so when Bob returns. If you have seen the movie Killer Inside Me then you will know what to expect from this. This one isn't nearly as graphic but it has very much the same style and feel. Affleck is becoming a terrific actor and it's just a matter of time before he get an Oscar nomination. While this movie is a little slow moving it does hold your attention and really puts you in the position of Ruth and makes you question how you would act in the same situation. This is not a movie for everyone as it is more art-house but if you are into the indi-movie scene then this is a great movie for you. Overall, one of the better indi-movies to come out recently but again this isn't for everyone. I give it a B.",1382659200,2,1203,4.167381974248927

8612782,5,B00F6Y3FT8,"[Rounded up from 4-1/2 stars] Honestly, I had never heard of ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints,"" but, still, I'm sad to see the lesser reviews for this moodier than expected but gem of a little film, as if the interpretation of its thematic elements of sacrifice, faith, compassion, acceptance, loyalty, and forgiveness is somehow too deep to grasp, though admittedly it necessitates your undivided attention and may require a repeat viewing (with subtitles for clarity).  Maybe viewers would prefer to see more modern-movie themes with zombies, vampires, unnecessary remakes and sequels, and CGI-laden dehumanization films, or perhaps it's the dark and deliberate yet ultimately effective pacing by director (of ATBS) David Lowery or its unspectacular and subtle tenderness with an omnipresent gloomy fate of the two leads (Casey Affleck as ""Bob"" and Rooney Mara as ""Ruth) that threw some viewers off.  But this film, centering around Bob doing time in his wife's place when she maims the sheriff in a shootout instigated by their partner in crime ""Freddy""), above all, is a love story of the greatest kind, perfectly complemented by an exceptional and wholehearted performance from the seemingly forever underrated Ben Foster (as the surprisingly compassionate sheriff), especially notable as being shot before Foster's equally brilliant performance as a bank-robbing brother in the current release, ""Hell or High Water"" (that's what you call acting range).  Academy Awards voters will be hard-pressed to ignore Affleck's and Foster's talents much longer, and the evidence is right here.",1472947200,,1581,5.444897959183673

8612785,1,B00F6Y3FT8,"The title is pretentiously cute and it goes downhill from there.  Mopey, dysfunctional people commit crimes and then we are supposed to care about them because they are in love.  And she has a baby.
