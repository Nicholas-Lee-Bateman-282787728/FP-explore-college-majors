2792850,5,B000O76ZRQ,"I remember when I first saw this movie. It was during the early 80's and I saw it playing at the MGM Grand theatre (before it became what is now Bally's) They used to have this theatre located on the mezzanine level that was all done up in fancy decor, with leather couches & a cocktail waitress service. What I remember most about the movie was how captivated I was by the story, actors, and vivid colors. Red Skeleton does this bit in the movie where he is drinking while slowly becoming drunk. Lucille Ball uses the same comedic skit on her famous ""I Love Lucy' Show entitled ""Lucy does a commercial"" It was at the approval of Red with whom she was fast friends, that she was able to make a funny skit even funnier. They certainly don't make movies like this anymore, which makes watching this over & over again more special",1108339200,5,827,4.376623376623376
2792852,3,B000O76ZRQ,"Frothy nonsense, with good color for demonstrating old TV sets. But the registration of the Technicolor strips is variable from scene to scene, giving color fringes to some edges that are more than visible on a modern set.",1492387200,,222,4.868421052631579

2792867,3,B000O76ZRQ,"I have no idea how the movie compares to the play it was based on. But the movie was meant to be light wartime entertainment, a relief from the hardships and dreariness of the times. The movie may not have had depth, but it wasn't really intended to. It was meant to show pretty sets and pretty girls and silly comedy and entertaining music.

On its own merits, it achieves it goals. The storyline is about the question of marrying for love or money, but that is secondary to the slapstick performance of Red Skelton or the music of Tommy Dorsey and his musicians or the displays of feminine beauty. The scene where the French peasants revolt against the king in the dream sequence also serve as subtle wartime propaganda.

The movie is also the first major film starring Lucille Ball, who gives a straight performance compared to the clowning she would be known for later in her career. Good as a period piece, but it makes no pretensions of high art.",1431388800,,952,4.52906976744186

2792870,5,B000O76ZRQ,"This was incredibly entertaining:  revealing the true craftsmanship of making movies.  Lucille Ball looked like an angel with her red hair and fabulous costumes.  Gene Kelly was at his finest.  Red Skelton looked very handsome. Zero Mostel was handsome too. Great, highly recommend it to anyone who loved those actors and actresses.",1414627200,2,332,5.326923076923077

This is a must have for Virginia O'Brien fans.  Lucille Ball is gorgious, Skelton is corny & wacky.  Gene Kelly also stars and Zero Mostel puts in a humorus supporting roll.",1394928000,2,350,5.0
2792873,1,B000O76ZRQ,The disc was in good shape. I was just disappointed because it wasn't the Obie I thought it was. My mistake.,1393113600,,108,4.190476190476191
2792894,5,B000O76ZRQ,"This sparkling 1943 MGM technicolor musical-comedy is typical of what came off their production line: lavish sets & costumes, ravishing girls..and of course, LOTS of songs! Based upon the stage musical, ""based"" is probably a loose term, as many changes were made to the film adaptation.
The cast is unbeatable: Red Skelton is at his riotous clownish best; Lucille Ball is simply stunning in full color; and Gene Kelly is at his handsome leading man/nimble-footed best. Even supporting players Rags Ragland (the funny looking dimwit with the accent) & Zero Mostel (25 years before ""The Producers"") manage to score some laughs, particularly in Mostel's delirious table flirtation monologue.
The first half of the film is standard plot stuff of the time, as numbers are trotted out and romantic entanglements ensue (as there's a love triangle brewing between hat check boy Skelton, stage star Ball, and songwriter Kelly), which leads to a ""mickey"" drink meant for Kelly but accidentally downed by Red instead that dissolves into an elaborate dream sequence, the livelier second half of the film. Red is then nocturnally transported to 18-century France where he's King Louis, and the rest of the modern-day characters play various period roles. Naturally, there's a plot to overthrow the king, led by resistance leader Kelly as The Black Arrow. There's some great moments here: Red amorously chasing Ball around the bedroom; Red's bumbling (he was taking falls on bare floors that most comics would shudder to even think about) as he falls out of a coach carriage, and later, into the drink; and Kelly's dashing speech in the pub. The film is climaxed by that great number ""Friendship"", which Skelton, Ball & Kelly pull off with gleeful zest & fun.
A lively musical-comedy adventure that's lots of fun to watch, thanks to its three stars & able supporting cast!",1346112000,6,1858,5.07516339869281
2792895,5,B000O76ZRQ,"This movie was purchased for a gift for my brother. We grew up watching the Red Skelton show and I Love Lucy. The main reason for purchasing this particular movie was the ""closed caption"" feature. It took a while to find out if it was closed captioned or not. Not everything is and it is not always easy to find that information. When you are deaf or hard of hearing, watching something wtih sound means nothing but with closed cpationing, you enjoy a movie in knowing what is happening and why.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Du-Barry-Was-a-Lady/dp/B000O76ZRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Du Barry Was a Lady</a>",1325894400,7,655,5.6938775510204085
2792896,1,B000O76ZRQ,"Sorry, kids, but this one is a real stinker, yet another in the long list of great Broadway musicals ruined by Hollywood. Nearly all the great Cole Porter songs have been removed and replaced by pallid imitations,  Skelton and Mostel are horribly unfunny, and there's endless padding and weak jokes. Lucille Ball, though horribly miscast, is very good (the original was Ethel Merman, for heaven's sake!) looks lovely and does everything she can to save the situation, and Gene Kelly performs the standard Gene Kelly act.
Avoid!",1259452800,4,527,5.057471264367816
2792897,5,B000O76ZRQ,Great cast. Classic comedy. Always a pleasure to watch. I enjoy it everytime. I am glad to have it in my collection of classic comedies.,1255737600,2,136,4.48
2792898,4,B000O76ZRQ,"May Daly (Lucille Ball) and Alec Howe (Gene Kelly) are in love, but he's too poor for her taste. Instead of marrying him, she wants to find a rich man even if she doesn't love him. When the hat check boy from the nightclub she works at (Red Skelton) wins a sweepstakes, she reluctantly agrees to marry him after he announces their engagement to the papers. Then after a big mix-up, the new money finds himself knocked out and dreaming he is Louis XV.

It is interesting that Ball wears red and pink frequently throughout the film, two colors that redheads are often warned to stay away from. Consequently, she looks more glamourous in her blonde wig and 18th century clothes in the dream sequence.

This snappy musical jumps around all over the place, but what it lacks in cohesiveness, it more than makes up for in entertainment. Really, the story isn't vital because the musical numbers are so good, and the stars have so much personality.

Kelly is gorgeous here, and his rendition of ""Do I Love You?"" is beautiful. ""I Love an Esquire Girl"" is a delight. The lyrics mention a lot of pieces of pop culture that are still relevant today, and it ends with a cameo by a beautiful star. The Cole Porter finale is a lot of fun as well, and a total departure from the story.

The worst musical number is Virginia O'Brien singing ""Salome."" The song isn't bad and her voice is great, but gosh, are her eyes dead! She looks incredibly bored the whole time she's singing, just staring into the camera like her eyes are made of glass.",1241568000,5,1525,4.494584837545126
2792899,4,B000O76ZRQ,"I absolutely love musicals, and while I'd rank Du Barry Was a Lady as one of the lesser films to come out of MGM's Freed Unit, it does have a lot going for it. The film is a shimmering Technicolor jewel, full of eye-popping sets and spectacular, elaborate costumes. Like two of the other films in the Lucille Ball Film Collection, Lucy plays a showgirl, but this time she's at her most luminous and sympathetic. Sure, she claims that money is more important than love, but she never leaves you doubting that she's got it bad for Gene Kelly's struggling piano-playing hoofer. Du Barry was only Kelly's second picture, and he gets a nice little solo to the Cole Porter gem ""Do I Love You?"" When the action moves to 18th-century France, Kelly turns into the ""Black Arrow,"" a swashbuckling character that nicely foreshadows Kelly's turn in The Pirate five years later. Red Skelton is absolutely hilarious as the hapless hat-check boy in love with Lucy who turns into Louis XV when he mistakenly drinks a ""Mickey Finn"" intended for Kelly. Zero Mostel and Virginia O'Brien round out the supporting cast nicely. Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra are also prominently featured as the music act at the club where all the action occurs. The DVD is supplemented with the trailer, a cartoon (""Bah Wilderness""), and a truly fascinating short subject - the Pete Smith Specialty ""Seeing Hands."" This short was nominated for an Oscar and tells the story of Ben Helwig, who was blinded as a child and went on to become a really talented machinist during the war. It's really a very forward-thinking piece urging industry to hire people with disabilities because they could make important contributions to war-time industry. Du Barry is a good film to view for anyone who's a fan of the magic touch the Freed Unit brought to movie musicals - top-notch talent, colorful spectacle, and catchy tunes.",1236988800,2,1876,4.811145510835913
2792900,4,B000O76ZRQ,"Very fun musical with some good dance numbers. DVD transfer quality is outstanding. The colors, costumes are excellent. It's great to see Lucille Ball with that red hair in technicolor. I've always thought she was a pretty woman, but in this movie she is stunningly beautiful. What a treat for the eyes!!",1198195200,,304,4.865384615384615
2792901,4,B000O76ZRQ,"You have to be a rabid Lucille Ball fan to enjoy this rather boring piece of fluff. The sinister ""comedy scenes"" between Ball and Kelly  are a drag  and Zero Mostel makes an incredibly bad imitation of  Charles Boyer. Production numbers have the usual Metro polish, the Technicolor is gorgeous, but the end result is a big disappointment. For a much better experience, look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BEST-FOOT-FORWARD-DVD-P-S-1-33-ENG-FUB/dp/B000OCY7US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BEST FOOT FORWARD (DVD/P&S-1.33/ENG-FUB)</a>",1190937600,,576,7.084507042253521
2792902,5,B000O76ZRQ,"While not the epitome of 40's musicals, ""Du Barry"" is good fun for several reasons. First being Lucille Ball, who looks stunning in Technicolor. Then there's the Technicolor itself which is vivid and bright with MGM gloss. There's the fantastic costumes, the Tommy Dorsey orchestra providing great swing music, an appealing Red Skelton and a handsome Gene Kelly.  Less appealing is a mugging Zero Mostel. Then there's a deadpan Virginia O'Brien doing a delightfully laconic faux strip-tease to a song about ""Salome"". She almost steals the show. But then, ""Du Barry"" IS a show based on a risque Broadway show but watered down for 40's film audiences. The plot is ridiculous about Skelton's  Mickey Finn causing a Louis XIV hallucination involving a cast of nightclub performers with Lucy (torn between love and money) figuring as the notorious Madame Du Barry. Just enjoy the MGM spectacle and music (and Lucy) and marvel at what musicals used to be. Pure entertainment. The DVD print is fantastic. Enjoy.",1182211200,5,1004,5.078787878787879
2792903,4,B000O76ZRQ,"Lucy is a great actress and a good dancer, but singing was never her forte' and her dubbed singing voice is distracting. I felt she was much better in her next movie, Best Foot Forward, which gave her a better comedy role versus this one which is more a musical one. If MGM had used her in straight comedy or even in an occasional dramatic role she would have had a longer career there instead of a mere 3 years. Meet the People, made the following year, was a ""B"" movie and in Without Love (1945) and Easy to Wed (1946) she was even downgraded to supporting actress category. On the plus side: this movie co-stars her longtime friend Red Skelton and their chemistry is incredible. Virginia O'Brien always adds to any movie, Gene Kelly doesn't have a lot of screen time (which is fine with me) and you can even catch a glimpse of budding vocalists Dick Haymes and Jo Stafford in Tommy Dorsey's band. I love Lucy (to coin a phrase) in MGM Technicolor and when you watch the movie be on the lookout for Lana Turner, in a 30 second walk-on, which was her first appearance before the Technicolor camera too!",1181692800,,1103,4.411764705882353

The movie version is strictly for Red Skelton fans, as Lucille Ball and Gene Kelly have relatively little to do. If one is a fan of the Big Bands, Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra are part of the cast. There is also Zero Mostel in a supporting role as a nightclub fortune teller. But all of them, Skelton included, have made much better movies.",1495756800,,498,4.365591397849462
