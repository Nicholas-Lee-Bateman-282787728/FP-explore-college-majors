8043195,5,B0006U3U4M,"The first season of Geisters: Fractions of the Earth comes to a close with Dobias on the brink of civil war, the Shirou history revealed and the Geisters in tatters.

The Geisters were formed as an elite fighting force to protect Dobias from its enemies, but exactly who Dobias' enemies are is not as clear as it should be.  There is a power struggle in the house of Juno that could determine the fate of the Geisters and Dobias itself.  As Alcion's past continues to haunt his present, Victor's allegiance is called into question.  Shai and Dean are on their own in the Shirou stronghold and Cris has emerged as the bedrock of the Geisters.  Can they all survive and if they do will they ever be a team again?

Political intrugue crashes head on with SciFi action in Vol. 3 of Geisters: Fractions of the Earth",1349308800,,810,4.476190476190476
