8185475,5,B0002X7G7K,"After his fiancee is murdered by Manchurian marauders, a young warrior, Superkicker John Liu (Struggle Through Death, Secret Rivals) sets out to do the same to those who were responsible to her death. Meanwhile, the Deadly China Doll herself, Angela Mao Ying (Dance of Death, Moon Light Sword and Jade Lion) is in possession of a list of rebels and the same Manchu killers want it and will stop at nothing to get it. It is not long before Angela Mao Ying and John Liu are fighting side by side in this rarely seen Old School Classic. Also starring is the ultimate bad ass of Old School-Chen Sing. COMMENT: I bought this DVD because Mao Ying stars in it. From all the movies in which Mao Ying stars, I never saw her more tidy, elegant and beautiful. And her voice, so sexy and dignified. All of a sudden I have the urge to propose to her.",1258502400,5,837,4.371794871794871
