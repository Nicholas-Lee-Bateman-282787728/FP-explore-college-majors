1968150,5,6304742630,"My young kids enjoy watching this movie. It's cute, magical, imaginative and entertaining.  Ghosts, castles and fantasy mixed with humor.",1306627200,,137,5.85
1968151,5,6304742630,"My item was in very good condition, the dvd was brand new and works perfectly.",1265068800,,78,4.266666666666667
1968152,3,6304742630,"I was impressed by this family-friendly ""spook"" movie--it was silly, touching, spooky and kept my adult interest throughout. Two things I found slightly disturbing: the mom's indifference to her son's welfare and Sally Kirkland's odd performance.
The mom's boyfriend's antics were a little cheesy, but kids will probably find them funny.
I did get this movie at The Dollar Tree ($1).",1194134400,,383,5.295081967213115
1968153,3,6304742630,"For kids, this is an excellent ""scary"" movie that's not too scary. I agree with other reviewers that the mom & mom's boyfriend could have been done better with different actors (the boyfriend was too ""cartoony"" and the  mom seemed like a conceited, uncaring mother--when she tried to be ""caring"" it came across as very fake). But as an adult, I did also love this movie--excellent storyline and ""cute."" Although I will say--I got it at Dollar Tree for $1--you def. cannot beat that!!",1183939200,,483,4.75
1968154,5,6304742630,"Little Ghost is a great movie for young kids. My daughter watches it over and over and my son loves the ""scares."" The lead boy in the movie is a terrific actor and the little girl ghost is perfectly mischievous and vulnerable.  The movie looks to be filmed in a real haunted castle. I think that is Academy Award winner Sally Kirkland who cameos as the mother ghost. She's great. So is the movie.",1147737600,3,396,4.351351351351352
1968155,5,6304742630,"This was exactly what I was looking for and in perfect condition upon arrival.

My grandson was thrilled as we could not find this locally and this was important to a 4 year old boy.

Thank you",1140998400,4,193,4.1891891891891895
1968156,3,6304742630,"I watched this movie when I was a kid and absolutely loved it!  I kept re-renting it.  I re-watched this movie when I was older and I didn't find it as wonderful as before.  Children will enjoy this movie very much, but an older audience may not like it so much.  All in all it's a cute film that really is meant for kids.",1047081600,5,322,3.984375
1968157,1,6304742630,"Frankly, I was disappointed by this film. Given the premise, I felt there was so much more that could be done than was done. Comparing it to, say, ""Casper Meets Wendy"" - which is in the same genre - the former was fast-paced and imaginatively conceived while the latter was a plodding dud. Even an old ""Topper"" episode made richer use of the comedic possibilities than this.
  Don't waste your time.",1015977600,2,399,4.605633802816901
1968158,3,6304742630,My neice is 4 years old and she loved this movie. As an adult I tought it  was corny but it had a good story line.  The Little boy and Girl ghost were  good casting but the mothers boyfriend was too predictable in his  reactions.  Not a very good actor. This movie could have been a hit with  better casting.  But kids do not notice this and think it is great.  It is  a fun movie for the whole family- adults will laugh because of the poor  acting.,968371200,2,449,4.0

It's not challenging film, but it is one you can safely watch with no fear of obscene language, violence or overt sex.
