8380410,4,B002TOL8TM,"Farewell, 2011 film

This is based on events that led to the fall of the Soviet nations of Eastern Europe. They show a snowy forest. A family watches a tennis game on TV. People in a theater watch a tightrope act. A man steps into an empty street and waits. Another man talks to him, he has important papers for him. The second man returns to his family. His son is disrespectful. The engineer meets a man from DST. President Reagan comments on foreign nations. The KGB has a new woman recruit. Boys and girls parade in Moscow. [Note the few automobiles.] That engineer is given papers to copy. Pierre shows them to his wife, who is against this work. This information is given to a top French official, Premier Mitterrand. But their foreign intelligence is infiltrated by the KGB.

The Russian agent is given an English code name to suggest the CIA. He reported 16 names in American government who are in contact with the Soviets. Those two men meet in a car. Whats the payoff? They talk. Two policemen follow Pierre, but his is not the quarry. Premier Mitterrand talks to President Reagan about those secrets. There is a meeting in a car, a paper flies out of an open window! Sergei predicts a new revolution for his country in the future. A teenager sings a song in the woods. [What does this imply?] Te French will cooperate with the CIA and tells about Farewell. The Russians spend more on espionage than research, a fortune. Pierre offers Sergei a Minox camera for accurate photographs; he refuses. The X Line names all the top Soviet agents abroad. Pierre asks Sergei to defect with his family.

Sergei argues with his son. Sergei has a domestic problem. At home Sergei makes up with his wife. Pierres wife saw him in the park, she has to protect her children. Pierre explains his actions; it gave him an ulcer. At work Sergei photograph documents, then delivers the Minox to Pierre. Its over. The French don't want to end a working source. Sergeis girlfriend will transfer to Leningrad for a new job. President Reagan watches an old Western movie, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. A masterpiece? Reagan wants to wipe out the X Line. President Reagan speaks to the nation about Star Wars. The Soviets have lost all their Western sources and know little. Gorbachev says they need a renewal, new energy.

Sergei has been arrested and is being questioned. He won't talk. His wife is greeted by Pierre. Sergeis home is searched by the KGB, they make a mess. Sergeis son Igor meets Pierre and questions him in his car. Pierre and his family depart. The KGB found that French poetry book. They learn about Pierres family absence and search for them, but they crossed the border into Finland. Sergei confesses. He later talks to his son. Pierre arrives at a NATO base, he is told to keep his secrets from the public. He asks for Sergeis family to be rescued; no chance at all. Pierre is told a secret about saving a network! Sergei is taken for a ride; one last gesture for him.

This is based on the book Bonjour Farewell by Serguei Kostine. The presentation of this foreign movie seems to differ from the style of American films, such as the mixture of languages and other actions.",1503878400,,3184,4.598591549295775
