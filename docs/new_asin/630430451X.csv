840667,4,630430451X,"This movie is interesting in many ways yet disappointing in so many others.  Being an anime that was made in 1996, I personally see no excuse for the poor animation that had me believing it was created in the mid 80's.  Nevertheless, the movie is still able to hold the viewer's interest, partly due to its short duration (45 min.), and partly because of the flashy moves and impressive fight scenes that the main character Baki gives us.  The whole premise and idea of this anime is solely centered on a mysterious karate fighter named Baki whose background and reasons for fighting in tournaments are unknown.  What surprised me most about Baki was his personality's uncanny similarity to Goku from Dragon Ball Z.  He is a very skilled fighter, yet he always manages to keep a smile and stay calm during his fights.  One might add that it may even be hard for a true collector of anime to take Baki or any of the fighters seriously due to the goofy way they're portrayed throughout the film.  Suspense is over-exaggerated with displays of characters' names whenever new ones appear in the movie, and there is nearly no background as to how any of the events geared up which may leave some viewers puzzled as we are plunged into the action head first.  Overall, however, this movie is good for what it was and i must add the final battle between Baki and his opponent was intense and enjoyable.  However, I would not recommend that anyone purchase this movie simply because I don't think it's worth spending over 20 dollars on a movie that's only 45 minutes long and is meant to be taken lightly.",1071619200,2,1597,4.595070422535211

840671,3,630430451X,"Once in a while, I like to kick back and watch an anime that's got nothing but lots of good old dirt-under-the-nails FIGHTIN'.  You can't go wrong with a title like ""Grappler Baki: The ULTIMATE FIGHTER"", can you?  So I gave it a rent and checked it out.  And you know what?  I was pretty impressed.  There's a lot to enjoy in this flick, most of which is the fighting itself.  The fight scenes were well done; not on par with, say, the choreographed genius of ""Street Fighter: the Animated Movie"", but they hold their own.  A lot of the moves hurt just to look at (like when a shoulder gets separated and they show you an inside-the-body shot of the bones coming apart) and the animation is pretty decent as well.  There's not much story here; just a guy named Baki who wants to be the best fighter in the land and the people he goes through to get there.  The final battle, though, between Baki and the ""Cord Cutter"" (speaking of painful techniques, ever have someone pull on your NERVES?) is a sight to behold.  All in all, a decent fight flick that will keep you entertained for almost an hour.  The only real problems I saw were the crowd shots (completely still and noiseless; I guess they were completely mesmerized by the fight) and the dubbing.  It wasn't bad, but I've heard a LOT better.  But hey, if you like the fightin' stuff, you'll enjoy it.  Great action and a minimum of sentiment. It's a good combination.",976665600,4,1423,4.423076923076923

7867755,2,630430451X,"Taking place in a Martial Arts tournament, there's a young white belt destroying the competition; this young man's name is Baki Hanma. While many people praise his skill despite carrying the title as a novice. Many are in disbelief on why he's so good. What exactly is Baki's secret? -summary

 Grappler Baki is a 45 minute OVA released in 1994 that is based on Keisuke Itagaki's manga. Now to be clear, I never liked this anime and time really hasn't done it any favors at all. I decided to rewatch it only because I recently gave the TV series Baki the Grappler a rewatch. I'm not normally a fan of remakes, but this is one title that really needed it through the 48 episode TV series, because this anime is so bland to the point it can barely even fall back on its action.

 Yuji Asada did a very poor job directing this anime. There is pretty much no story and the plot is non existent. Before some crazed fan decides to leap and shout out the short run time as an excuse. I recommend giving Battle Angel a watch to see what a competent anime director can do in a short time. This anime is all about the fight and nothing more. Baki is competing in a Karate tournament for whatever reason. Then he makes his way off to the underground circuit where he's champion, which explains why he's so tough for people to beat and far beyond black belts in the other tournament he's competing in. There's no real reason on why he's fighting there, these things are all just happening and various characters are making token appearances just to have them. There are at least three characters and a couple of segments that could have been completely removed and the ""story"" wouldn't have been effected at all. This is just how bare bones it is. Grappler Baki makes Ayane's High Kick look much better than what it is, and that anime is around the same run time.

 Baki is an unlikable character. He was even a bit cocky before his final match against Shinogi Kosho, a martial arts master whose main skill is to pierce his enemies skin with his fingers, and then severe arteries and nerves to cripple them. I found myself cheering on Shinogi to kill Baki; and Baki is the main character who's suppose to be liked. This is something that should never happen.

 The grimey animation is standard for a 1994 OVA. It's very low budget with not much attention paid to the backgrounds. There are quite a few static backgrounds during the matches, and a small amount of reused cels. Fortunately, there are times when the action stands out. The fight between Baki and Shinogi is very brutal with some gory, deep penetrations and ripping of nerves. The blows are bone chilling with some high impact. Therefore, there is something to like here even though every fight before this isn't even worth talking about. The BGM really doesn't add much life to this lifeless anime, and I hate the English dub too. Carter Cathcart voices Baki and this guy is annoying. I really hated Baki's shrieks and yells. I wish Shinogi would have just strangled him to death. I recommend the sub which is better but doesn't really help this anime much.

 Grappler Baki shouldn't have been made for any reason. This short OVA makes me appreciate the TV series even more despite being unfinished. One can tell that this OVA had a story just screaming to be let out. There was potential every where and I remember hoping this anime would get the series treatment when I first saw it back in the 90's. Overall, I only recommend this title to hardcore anime fans whom must see them all. If you do not fall into that category then skip this completely for the TV series, because you're not missing anything by leaving this alone.

Pros: Some brutal action towards the end

Cons: Nothing else besides the brutal action towards the end",1412121600,,3784,4.548529411764706
7867756,5,630430451X,"This film was very action packed. It was actually English dubbed!

I always liked Grappler Baki, I watched it 10 years ago when I was a child and I just remembered that I want to live that experience and see this great fighting anime once again. It had a great impact with superb animation. For action thrillers, anime lovers or martial arts film seekers, I would say definitely see this film!",1374278400,3,393,4.535211267605634
7867757,5,630430451X,"When I first saw this anime and it's introduction to the character of Baki,I was awestruck on what a great yet short anime this was. It's got great tourney fighting action,interesting characters and hard hitting action.

The animation however did have some unusual similarities to that of DBZ,some even resembled some characters to each other that I saw before,probably done by the same animation team as well,not saying that's bad or anything.

It's short and sweet and worth adding to your collection,a short but sweet treat at that.",1367193600,,535,5.068181818181818
7867758,5,630430451X,"Grappler Baki: Ultimate fighter is an anime that was released in the late 90's and is based of the early issues of Grappler Baki the manga. The story kicks off right away at the Japanese Karate Competition. Baki is a last minute entry and basically wipes the mat with every opponent that is thrown his way, including the students of the world's greatest karate dojo. You soon find out that this competition was all just a warm up for Baki as he finds himself at the underground arena defending his championship title against Kosho Shinogi, The Cord Cutter. Shinogi uses a style of karate that can severe nerves beneath the skin and make his enemy immobile, or even blind. This fight can well be Baki's last.
Now on to my opinion of the anime; nearly flawless. Now take into account that this anime has very little storyline, yet I feel it's better than it's 2004 counterpart. It has everything you need out of an action anime; Action. The fights are superb and brutal, and even with the lack of story the characters are intriguing. They also kept this anime short and sweet, running at about 90 minutes which in my opinion is perfect length. I give this one an 8.5-9 out of 10.",1303430400,,1177,4.530516431924883
7867759,5,630430451X,The tournament is deadly as can be and only the chosen can be pick to fight in the shinshinkai underground tournament. Baki is an excellent fighter who can not be defeated and when he come up against a fighter who can pull your nerve cords from your body he has trouble figuring out how to beat him.,1251158400,,299,4.2631578947368425
7867760,5,630430451X,"I first saw this over 10 years ago as a rental.  In the eyes of everyone that saw it with me, it's a classic.  It is short... VERY short.  It's almost like they expect you to know everything about all the characters and left 45 minutes worth of backstory, character development and plot on the cutting room floor.  So while 45 minutes isn't much, if you editted out all the fluff in a DragonBall Z episode, you'd probably only have about 4 minutes.  Thus, this is the equivalent of 10 episodes of your standard fighting anime.

What sells it is how over-the-top it can be.  It could be a lot worse, but for its time, it was pretty impressive.  For example, when he fights the huge guy behind on the cover, the huge guy breaks his hand (the bone pops out the skin) when he punches Baki in the face.  You'd think Baki would be in a lifelong coma after charging into a punch like that from such a large man, but he gets up with a wry grin and a swollen eye and says, ""Crying over a broken hand?""
That's just part of the first fight.

Although it's not on par with Fist of the North Star for ludicrous brutality and machismo, it's up there.  I actually like that from time-to-time, but most people don't.  I give it 5 stars, most people would consider it worthy of a rental.",1199145600,,1270,4.245833333333334
