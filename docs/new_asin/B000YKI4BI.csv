3030826,5,B000YKI4BI,"The ""Family Affair"" gang moves surprisingly steadily into their 5th and final season with some wonderful episodes for a quickly-maturing Buffy (ingratiating as always). She nearly bids farewell to faithful companion Mrs. Beasley in episode 22, and tangles with Paris Hilton's mom in episode 20 (""The Joiners"" aka ""The Mod Maidens""). In episode 4, Uncle Bill hires help for Mr. French in the guise of Nancy Walker as Emily (who makes sporadic appearances throughout the year). Kathy Garver's Cissy seems awfully busy with school during this season and is kept rushing in and out (books in hand), though she does bring over a very pregnant houseguest in episode 9 (how much you wanna bet the baby decides to arrive unexpectedly?). Although it's sad to see ""Family Affair"" reach the end of its run, the worthy stories get spread about pretty evenly, and all the Davises get their share of the spotlight. Farewell Davis Family!

8233159,4,B000YKI4BI,"I did not purchase the videos but watched on Prime.  However, I would like a chance to view the interviews and commentary people have mentioned in their reviews.  I loved this show as a child ( I would be about the same age as the twins).  Most of the story lines are still relevant today.

My only objection, which I would only realize as an adult, - and the fact that I binged watched, so memory is very clear episode to episode - is the lack of age progression and how we, the viewing audience, are supposed to forget what happened from one episode to the next.  First, I saw a couple of plot lines repeated over the five seasons.

Next, the kids were with Uncle Bill for 5 years, and this is celebrated early in season 5.  But the last couple of episodes in series 5 went backwards.  All of a sudden all three kids lost two years in age and had only been in NYC for three years!  I really dislike when writers do this.  Cissy would have been 20 and a college sophomore, not 18 and a freshman.  The twins would be 11, not 8 - actually losing three years of life span (or almost 9 as Buffy says).  The last few episodes wore thin on me having children that looked 11 acting 8.  If the writers were going to do this, they should have stopped at season 4, when it was still a hint more believable.

I also liked the season (3?) that Mr. French was more human and more involved in each episode and had full conversations and showed he had a personality.  Then in Seasons 4 and 5 he became a background prop again.  That was sad.  I imagine Sebation Cabot had something to do with this as I read he was not happy with the series and neither was Brian Keith.  I think this is why we see less of them and why they became so quiet and anti-climatic in the last season.  Just guessing, though.

I also want to know why, when they went back to Terre Haute in season 5 - why would they stay at a boarding house and not with family?  What happened to that huge family?  How are the kids going to remember anything talking to total strangers?  That episode was pretty badly written.  If they couldn't get those actors again, or look-a-like actors, they should have just scrubbed the whole idea to begin with.  It was not believable for a second.  Add, yes, the kids can call Uncle Bill, Dad.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I understand Bill struggling with that because he had to take his own brother's place - but give a show about his struggle.  They were progressive with so many other subjects.  Why not this?  But the kids (or at least Cissy and Jody) wanted to call him Dad and that should have been it.

Other than these type of things, which is how all television was written back then, I enjoyed the series immensely, even now at my ripe old age of 55.",1505865600,,2756,4.2203065134099615
8233160,5,B000YKI4BI,"I didn't purchase the dvd set, but I watched the series on Prime Video. I don't believe folks realize how progressive Family Affair really was. Two single men, albeit a bachelor and gentleman's gentleman, are raising 3 kids by themselves. The children's parents have died in an accident. Episodes tackle issues such as public vs private school (confronting the integration of schools in the 60s), run-aways, orphans, immigrants (both children and adults), income gaps of the upper and lower economic classes, struggling learners vs advanced learners (skipping grades), pregnancy, teen marriage, broken bones, disabilities, childhood obesity, and even the death of a child and militants hunting a woman and her child!!  I think the reason people fail to realize how progressive this show was is because of the gentle and patient nature of Uncle Bill and Mr. French in handling the obstacles. To me, this show is more of a role model to parents how to be better parents, not just for kids on how to behave properly. The acting was superb. Anissa Jones should have won an Emmy. She was remarkable. Her acting skills equated with Brian Keith and Sebastian Cabot.",1502841600,7,1158,5.03125
