1255625,1,B00002NDLW,"Aida is one of the most popular operas of the repertoire, but this DVD, released in Brazil years ago by Opera on DVD collection, the staff of the Scala di Milano stepped on the ball.

The scenarios are heavy, loaded to the extreme, over-colored and a size no geekiness. The costumes are of a bad taste tremendo. Bregas and grimaces, that more resemble a costume party where everyone wants to enjoy.

The makeup of the protagonists to the brink galhofa. Tudo comes together in the Triumphal March, the apex of the excess.

Pavarotti's voice is excellent, is in its best days. But his large body round Panchaia not remember a warrior ready to defend their homeland. Scaring the most passionate of Aidas.

The ballet is another of the crazy antics that some of Scala resolve invent. That choreography is more boring that.

The only thing left that DVD are the voices, Maria Chiara, Ghena Dimtrov and Luciano Pavarotti are singing too.

Friends: Shelves it. And for five thousand years at least, this video deserves to be mummified.

PRATELEIRA NELES:Gravaes que merecem ficar mofando na prateleira.

Aida  uma das peras mais populares do repertrio, mas nesse DVD, lanado no Brasil anos atrs pela coleo pera em DVD, o pessoal do Scala di Milano pisou na bola.

Os cenrios so  pesados, carregados ao extremo, coloridos em excesso e de uma cafonice sem tamanho. Os figurinos so de um mal gosto tremendo. Bregas e caretas, que mais lembram uma festa  fantasia onde todos querem aprecer.

A maquiagem dos protagonistas beira a galhofa. Tudo isso se junta na Marcha Triunfal, o pice do excesso.

A voz do Pavarotti  excelente, est em seus melhores dias. Mas seu corpanzil redondo pano em nada lembra um guerreiro pronto para defender sua ptria. Afugentaria a mais apaixonada das Aidas.

O bal  outra das excentricidades que algum maluco do Scala resolver inventar. Que coreografia mais  sem graa  aquela.

A nica coisa que sobra desse DVD so as vozes, Maria Chiara, Ghena Dimtrova e Luciano Pavarotti esto cantando muito.

Amigos: Prateleira nele . E por uns cinco mil anos, no mnimo, esse video merece ser mumificado.

1255626,3,B00002NDLW,"CRITICISM:

1. If you know the opera very well and can handle the Italian, tough. There's no way to get Italian subtitles (on either the PAL or the NTSC version).

2. The ""grand march"" (musically intended to be the most magical moment of this opera) was inanely choreographed. According to the libretto, they're supposed to be bringing in ""the spoils of war,"" as they dance to the music. Instead we have a bunch of guys dragging giant statues around the stage with ropes. The famous ""Dance of the Moorish Slaves"" was also ineptly done, but that has been adequately discussed by other reviewers.

3. Pavarotti does indeed have weight problems. He's so fat in this performance, it's distracting.

4. The quality of the audio recording, if you do yourself right with some quality headphones and listen to it carefully, is frequently poor. The attentive listener can hear pops, clunking, clanking, coughing, page turning, etc. (Of course, to be fair, this WAS recorded live.) This is something you'll want to know if you're an aural purist.

PRAISE:

1. Singingwise, the performers are at their peak.

2. With the exception of the lack of Italian, the subtitles were well brought off:  accurate and literate.

3. Considering the limitations of their situation, the cameramen did an excellent job. But amazing work on their part doesn't necessarily mean it's quality viewing.",1115856000,,1370,5.0
1255627,4,B00002NDLW,"First off, I must address the reviewer who criticized the nude women in Amneris' bath scene.  This production was staged in Italy, where the native population does not giggle like a schoolgirl at the sight of a woman's bare breast.  The nude women, all chosen according to the model of classic female beauty, added an element of sensousness, not lewdness.  If they were so lewd, why would they cover up when the group of small boys burst onto the stage?

As other reviewers have stated, this production has its ups and downs.  This is the first time I have seen a taped Pavarotti stage performance, and boy, he makes Ramon Vargas look like the greatest actor alive.  Once, Martina Arroyo (herself a spectacular Aida) was once asked, in an interview, if it was detrimental to have a very heavy opera singer onstage.  Her response was quite intelligent; she said it depended on how the singer moved.  Without mentioning names, she stated that when you see some singers, all you think is ""all that weight."" Well, she could well have been thinking of Pavarotti.  Half the time, when the camera zooms in, we see him panting like a tired dog.  It doesn't help that he licks his lips like one, a very course habit for the operatic stage.

In addition to his weight issues, Pavarotti seems to feel incredibly lost if he is onstage for more than a few seconds without singing.  Just witness him during the triumphal march.  As for his singing, it is good, but not heroic, and Radames calls for both.

Maria Chiara is not a first-rate Aida, but I happen to like her interpretation.  For the person who likened her to a figure slithering in the shadows, think about this:  You are taken captive, the daughter of a King.  You wonder from day to day if it will be your last.  Furthermore, you soon discover that you are at the mercy of the whims of a jealous, scorned captor.  To add insult to injury, your father denounces you after he asks you to do the impossible.  Well, in this light, would it have been proper for any Aida to prance regally across the stage?

As Amneris, Ghena Dimitrova looks like Cher on the Nile.  Really, her makeup looks like it was applied by a drag queen, thought the effect is fabulous.  Dimitrova has some patchy moments, but after a rather wooden presence in Act I, she really catches fire in Act II.  The basic tone and projection is commendable for a non-Italian singer.  When she experiences a metanoia in the judgment scene, we really believe it.

I also loved Juan Pons as Amonastro.  We have a lot of good baritones today, but his Amonastro is polished, and again a believable character.

As for the costumes, they leave something to be desired.  For such a monumental staging, they could have given us the look and feel of classic Egypt, without overdoing it.  Instead, what we get is a mostly drab palatte.",1115769600,,2834,4.576540755467197
1255628,3,B00002NDLW,"I found this a very interesting presentation of a very popular and famous opera. Of course, we all know that Aida is to take place in Egypt, however, I wasn't sure if Egypt was the country in which the story was taking place, or exactly which time period it was taking place in. Not one bit of the costuming (or the sets) appeared Egyptian in the slightest degree, and strange as it sounds, the entire opera seemed to be more something from the ""Arabian Nights"" than the days of the Pharoah's. Putting that aside, visually, the opera was stunning and very beautiful. Most of the costumes did the singers proud, making them really appear glamorous. The only exception was, of course, Pavarotti, and his costume looked like it was made in ""Desert Sands Tent Shop."" The oriental shoulder pads did little to even out his very LARGE frame. He could have actually worn Jessye Norman's costume for Sieglinde in Walkure (done by the MET) and it would have looked almost the same, excepting it was in brown and this in blue. The basic figure was almost the same as Norman at that time.

The sound wasn't bad either, and we were not ""treated"" to the strange pianissimo at the end of Celeste Aida we are greeted with in the recording released on Decca of this same performance. I found the sound quite clear, and only very slightly did it seem unbalanced, and only from time to time. It was never a distraction.

The distraction was firstly the super bad acting of most of the singers, and I mean most of them. Pavarotti was his wooden self with no sense of character, or anything, for that matter. He sang well, but without anything very dramatic being conveyed. Chiara sounded actually way better in the DVD live performance recording than she did in the studio one of this same performance. There she was more than lifeless and her penetrating

high notes really were awful. Here, however, she sang quite fine, and even though those same high notes were a bit too brilliant and at times almost shrill, they were fine. The problem with her performance is she is about the most boring person I have ever seen on stage. Pavarotti can't act, but he is seldom boring (even just being himself gives an audience a lot). Her actions consisted of rising one arm, then two; in moments of high drama she would move which ever arm more quickly, but the basic movements never changed. She had what Wagner called ""eternal swimming motions"" which he thought were horrible. I happen to agree. She always made her stage entrances as if she were frightened we might know she were there. She reminded me of a character from Rikki Tikki Tavi who would slink around the walls of the room and never actually dare to enter the center of it. One bit of stage business that really was affective was having her enter the famous Nile Scene by boat. Here, and only here, was her ""fear of being seen"" affective. Other than that, it was a constant annoyance.

The other characters were completely forgettable, as they are in most every performance. Who ever remembers who plays the King, or the high priest? Few of us. However, we do appreciate when they are affective in the scenes they are in. In this case, they were affective, very affective, but like all minor roles, they were overshadowed by the leads.

And in this case, everyone was overshadowed by Ghena Dimitrova. Her Amneris was exciting and developed carefully as a character. Too often she is presented as if she is some psychic witch constantly suspicious and dying to do evil. If one reads the libretto, one really gets the feeling that she and Radames were a thing before the pretty Aida entered the picture. In the trio just after the opera starts, we are often treated to a very angry Amneris, when in reality she is only suspicious that perhaps Radames doesn't love her as he once did. We saw her doubts and fears, and her suspicions, but we were not forced to see a raving witch so early in the opera (and if the truth be told, at no time should she be presented that way). She is a princess, she is powerful, she is in love, and she is rejected. She feels jealously, even rage, but she is filled with sorrow, and anger with herself for having caught Radames betraying his country and her. Dimitrova captures all the emotions of the part, and is not the traditional raving, jealous witch we are accustomed to seeing. Her great scene is the trial scene, and we are not disappointed. Finally we have an Amneris who can manage the upper register with strength and power, which is needed. I guess I am torn between a mezzo singing the role, and a really powerful dramatic soprano with a good lower range. I found Dimitrova far more exciting than Cossotto (who is considered a legend in the part). Cossotto had the voice, but her Amneris is nothing but a jealous witch from beginning to end. There is no development and she is not a great actress either. One thing that was refreshing was seeing the person of Amneris actually listening during the trial. So often she is just counting time waiting for her next big outburst.

I enjoyed the work, but I rated it only a three because it was lacking in so many ways. Visual affects, lovely costumes (even if they suggest nothing of the era or country the story is taking place in), and good singing don't create the illusion of drama that we expect to see. So many singers now days are first rate actors, and we are getting more and more used to them. Even an opera like Aida requires them, for the show of the triumphal scene is just that, one scene. When we don't see real people and feel real emotions (both because of their voices and their actions) we miss half the story and all the character development that must be there.",1096070400,,5705,4.544747081712062
1255629,4,B00002NDLW,"A nivel general esta es una gran version de Aida, comenzando por la puesta en escena de LUCA RONCONI, bella y coherente visualmente en todo momento, sin los alardes tipicos de la obra, pero con un inteligente movimiento de figurantes.
Luego, en el apartado vocal tenemos al sobresaliente Radames de LUCIANO PAVAROTTI, en uno de sus dias de gloria, a la poderosa Amneris de GHENA DIMITROVA (sin los medios de la Zajick, pero muy notable tambien) y a esos lujos para los papeles secundarios que se llaman PAATA BURDZULADZE (Ramfis), JUAN PONS (Amonasro) y NICOLAI GHIAUROV (Rey de Egipto), todos de lujo en sus respectivas partes.
La Aida de MARIA CHIARA cumple bien, aunque no llega a arrebatar vocalmente, impone una presencia escenica bastante interesante. Aunque prefiero a Aprille Millo...
LORIN MAZZEL lleva comodamente la direccion de los cuerpos estables de la Scalla de Milan, todos ellos muy ductiles, rematando asi una version de Aida bastante interesante.",1067126400,,965,5.1528662420382165
1255630,3,B00002NDLW,"The singing was wonderful, but the staging ranged from distracting to hilarious.
You like slaves?  This production has them in abundance, cluttering up the action, groaning and moaning as they pull and push stones and monuments like a pack of crack-smoking ants.  They were especially annoying in the triumphal scene, where the chorus could barely squeeze on stage, cowering in the background while the over-acting wretches took center stage.  (Hey slaves!  Triumphal celebration going on!  Take five!)
It was also kind of weird in Act I, Scene II, where the rocks just popped up out of the ground, noisly banged about, and occasionally formed,one assumes, significant shapes.
Act II, Scene I was bizarre.  First, there were topless women ""bathing.""  Let me tell ya, topless women are always a distraction, except in a topless bar, and even there they distract.  What was the point of them here?  Second, while most ballets in this scene feature the usual gaggle of Egyptian girls ""walking like an Egyptian,"" they changed it up a bit by having young boys--very young boys!--hopping about in thongs, while being whipped by some old dudes.  (Speaking of pointless, don't miss the entrance of Radames in the Act II, Scene II, with the scantily clad young hunk standing over him, ready for action.)
Finally, Herr Pavarotti was big enough; hanging curtains on him only added to the effect.  (One could almost hear the slaves lamenting, ""We can pull the sphinx across the stage, but not that tenor!"")
It is also noted that the once discriminating La Scala audience fell for this MTV approach like wrestling fans marking out to a Hulk Hogan pose down.
All in all, an absurd and sterile desecration of Verdi's opera.",1066694400,,1708,4.957894736842105
1255631,5,B00002NDLW,"A cast like this is practically impossible to find or replicate  today.  Pavarotti and Dimitrova were in their prime (the latter would ""progress"" to the Aida rle shrotly afterwards) and Maria Chiara, in spite of a tentative start, amply shows that she still was in very fine form, her portrayal soon growing into a warmth and securenes seldom seen. The Ronconi production was  spectacular and shed some of the traditions that tended to be the norm (like dancing, remember the ballets were asked for by Verdi to accomodate Parisian tastes when the original production moved from Cairo to Europe) and thence you will encounter the ballet music firstly to accomodate pranks by kids who brusquely interrupt the languor and peacefulness of Amneris's bath, and later to accompany some heavy labouring by slaves in the triumphal scene. Mazzel's conducting is precise and to the point, the La Scala orchestra irreproachable as is also the very idiomatic chorus. And what's more, to have Ghiaurov, Buchuladze and Pons to support Pavarotti, Chiara and Dimitrova as Amonasro, the Paraoh and Ramfis was a splendid luxury only a theatre like La Scala could attract. The opera was recorded live some 15 years ago and, along with the Met's rival version with Millo and Domingo on a DG dvd, belong in any collection. You can't go wrong with either, although I'd slightly prefer this La Scala production, in spite of the lack of ballet criticised by some colleague reviewers. And don't mind the (for me unobtrusive) nudity that accompanies the Amneris' bath scene: after all, it's only natural that people undress to bathe!",1025222400,,1606,5.007490636704119
1255632,5,B00002NDLW,"This is a fabulous opera. It is nothing compared to the Broadway production. Despite Luciano Pavarotti's weight, he has an amazing voice and is perfect for the role of Radames. Maria Chiara makes a wonderful Aida. Ghena Dimitrova is a fabulous Amneris. I just wish they mentioned her character by name. The sets are amazing. I think it is amazing how they managed to fit the exterior of the Temple of Vulcan beneath the stage. I think one of the pillars looked like Louis Armstrong. Watch for that pillar. The guy who plays Amonasro looked so convincing, you would have thought he was actually African American. Mind you, this was the first time I saw that guy. I've heard that he's really white. Even though I give it 5 stars, I have three complaints. One is major and two are minor. The major one is the first scene of Act II. It's Nudist City in that scene. There are naked women exposing their you-know-whats in front of millions of opera patrons. To make matters worse, one minute you're getting over the shock of naked women, suddenly, the Moorish Slave Dance starts up and naked kids run on stage. Some may have been wearing jewelry that covers up their middle areas but their tushies are still exposed. It is a crime for women and children to expose themselves in public. My three minor complaints are the subtitles that go ok at the beginning of the opera but get quirky after Ramfis exits. They either show up, show up too late, or don't show up at all. My second minor complaint is the outfit that Aida wore in her final scene. Why did she get dressed up just to die with Radames. Did she want to look beautiful when archaeologists found the tomb. She and the mothers of the Moorish children should have protested about the costumes. It's too late now but still, that bawdy headdress looked too vibrant for a tomb. My final complaint (and this one is pretty minor) is that during the curtain calls at the end of the show, there was a shot of a balcony but a house light got in the way making room for the DVD's only moment of poor filming.",1022457600,,2050,4.454787234042553

Ghena Dimitrova as Amneris is absolutely superb. Pavarotti's voice is top  notch as you can imagine, but his acting is kind of stiff. Maria Chiara  sounds fine, although I think Birgit Nilsson is my favorite with a brighter  voice.
Many people criticize the slave dance (Act II) with nudity, I  agree. The triumphant scence is obscured with gigantic props, with made the  stage too crowded and clumpsy - La Scala's stage is just simply not big  enough.
There are occasional noises from back stage and the audience,  but it may be inevitable.

1255636,3,B00002NDLW,"With such great artists as Luciano Pavarotti and Juan Pons, the performance itself was wonderful to have more than 5 stars. However... (sigh) I couldn't appreciate this masterpiece properly and comfortably  because the English subtitles were awkwardly provided to this Italian  opera. There was ""timing"" or ""synchronization"" problem  between singing and showing subtitles. It's often that the subtitles are  showed late after singers already start to sing his part. Sometimes no  subtitles provided while singing. You could easily imagine how it would be  uncomfortable. The engineer never seemed to be skillful to find the right  moment to put a subtitle in. An expert who understands Italian or the opera  should have worked for the subtitles. I strongly urge the  manufacturer(Image Entertainment) not to make this mistake again. Never  again!
All in all, this would be okay for those who understand Italian  or the  opera well, but it will probably make most watchers get annoying  and even  angry.",947030400,,1002,5.2993630573248405

And the triumphal march is anything but triumphal. The stage is full of large, heavy looking, shifting Egyptian monuments. It consists of slaves being forced to work by a platoon of guards, while the chorus tries to avoid being crushed by the monumental moving scenery, and the principals are brought in on chariots which look like floats in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. This is by far the worst Aida that I have seen on dvd. The dvd of the Domingo/Metropolitan Opera production is much better.

Pavarotti delivers the greatest ""Celeste Aida"" I have ever heard and the Aida ""Processional"" following his battle success and prior to his honorable ""confession"" about giving away Military secrets, albeit accidentally.

I read about Aida's (Maria Chiara) faulty portrayal here but I found the diva wonderfully musical and sensuous: She does spend a lot of time writhing on the floor.

The monsterous sets can overwhelm but not in a distractive way; the less than crystalline video transcription doesn't help, in that area. (or aria..sorry).

Video is fuzzy, though the blues are powerful; audio is passable, though I wonder if that light applause has more to do with the recording (or the venue size) than the performance?",1363737600,,873,5.133802816901408

Paata Burchuladze here sings the Pharaoh and sung Ramfis on the CDs, and it is Ghiaurov who sings Ramfis here. The CD Pharaoh was Luigi Roni. Amonasro on the CDs was Leo Nucci and here Juan Pons. The question is: does the DVD add anything of value to the purely audio experience of the CDs? Overall, I don't think so. For the most, I find that it rather detracts, although I'll be expressing a minority and positive view about two of its principals, Pavarotti and Dimitrova.

Luca Ronconi is one of the most brilliant directors of theatre and opera in Italy, his productions are noted for being daring, challenging and illuminating - but not here. He was defeated, either by Aida, or by La Scala, or a combination of both. I'm not sure what the sets and staging in Act I are about but at least they avoid the usual Zefirelli Egyptian paraphernalia. Clearly they are not meant to be ""realistic"" - meaning, your customary pseudo-Hollywood representation of a theatrical ancient Egypt - although there are many more or less realistic elements of scenery. But the background view doesn't try to conceal its nature of being a painted backdrop, representing some semi-circular mountains, quarry, sandpit - nothing you would recognize as specifically Egyptian. Ronconi stages a lot of slaves tolling at bringing the pieces of set onto or out of stage. Act II is better, and at least you get to see a bunch of young female supernumaries bare-breasted, bathing, being massaged, in an obvious reference to the 19th century Orientalist movement in painting and photography. Very pretty tableaux - but may we have more close-ups, please? I wish Ronconi hadn't decided to place that boy with a fan in front if Dimitrova/Amneris, he seems bored and not to know what he's doing there.

Camera work in Act I is not very interesting, and sometimes downright poor. There is one shot from the left balcony which is much too distant: a video shouldn't be the simple reproduction of the live situation, or what is is for? At one point at the beginning, in the Radames recitative before ""Celeste Aida"", the camera shooting a close-up on Pavarotti loses focus (circa 6:15) - the ONE thing a film director should want to edit out. On Amneris' first entry you can see at the screen's right edge that there is a person in waiting (10:48), but the camera cuts it almost entirely (you see no more than an arm) and when comes the wide angle, the person is gone. No way: either cut out the person entirely or show him/her entirely, but not just an arm letting the spectator wonder who the hell that was - and not getting the answer. At the beginning of Act I scene 2, the so-called Consecration scene (30:35), you see the slaves turning some giant horizontal mill-wheel, apparently behind a gauze because the image is hazy, doing what? That, you understand only 50 seconds later: lifting up (or pretending to) some giant piece of scenery from the underground (polystyrene rocks and blocks - I don't know if there was any pretense at being ""realistic"" there, but if so it badly misfired - I think Ronconi meant these to be ""sacred rocks"" or something. They look Celtic to me rather than Egyptian, but I confess to not being particularly knowledgeable in Egyptian archaeology). And then at the end of the scene, it goes back underground, without the necessity of its presence being established at any point.

The triumphal scene of Act II has more slaves panting to move huge blocks in and out of place, including the Sphinx, seen from under. Unlike what many reviewers say, sure, the Ballabile is ""choreographed"", even if it is in the form of female beggars - I don't think they're meant to be slaves, only the have-nots of that purported Egypt - being thrown loafs of bread (1:04:06); I don't find it any more ridiculous than a traditional ""ballet"". And they must have had Barack for Pharaoh: the 47% poor seem quite happy about their condition. The camera work is much better here also. The Act I Dance of the Priestesses is not too embarrassing (34:28), the Act II Dance of the little Moorish slaves is, as usual (45:31). I hope the kids had fun, running and jumping around all but naked. The beginning of Act III has an Egyptian gondola glide none too smoothly (they must have forgotten to bribe the Scala stagehands that evening) from stage left to right, with some reeds in the foreground right, against a dark-blue backdrop representing, half-realistically half-artistically, sky, sea (or is it supposed to be the Nile?) and the columns of some decrepit temple. Inconspicuous enough. Act IV has the stage barred by a terracotta prison wall with huge guillotine-like doors, the center one revealing a first-floor level on which Ramfis stands for the judgment scene - quite nice. Ramfis sings in the direction of the backstage, his back to the audience, which provides the sonic distance required by Verdi. The soldiers dressed up in mock Egyptian mini-skirts surrounding Pavarotti/Radames are ridiculous - no wonder it takes eight of `em to surround him, it's like surrounding the larger, outside Russian matryoshka doll with 8 of the tiny center ones. There is another set change for the tomb scene - it must have take ages live! - and again the sets look like a painted backdrop and a few polystyrene blocks - pretty cheap, but maybe La Scala ran out of money for the final scene. How Aida managed to be all dressed-up for her final appearance, when she is supposed to have been running away and hiding from the Egyptian guards who killed her father, only Ronconi can tell. Maybe the ancient Egyptians provided their tombs with a wardrobe.

Obviously Ronconi doesn't care too much either about historical and geographical credibility - the loot brought back from Ethiopia is in fact Babylonian (at 1:06:20 enters the gigantic statue of the Demon Pazuzu), and I wondered why some of the Egyptians soldiers should crawl in dejection in front of the Pharaoh (at first I thought they were the Ethiopian prisoners and wondered why they were left with their helmets and armors), but who cares about those details? The Egyptian priests also look more Babylonian or even Jewish than Egyptian, but that's the least of one's concerns. Oh, and the Sphinx DOES have its nose, which places the action in fact very far back, since it is generally thought that it was built even earlier than 2500 BC. But apparently the original sketch of the opera, made by the famous French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, was inspired by the reign of Ramses III, believed to have taken place from 1186 to 1155 BC, and by then the Sphynx would probably have lost its nose already (although it is not known when it happened). But, sure, taking such subtleties in consideration is demanding too much of an opera audience. Anybody can be knowledgeable when universal knowledge is available two clicks away on Wikipedia.

I don't find the sonics ideal either, it is a stage pickup and the voices sometimes sound distant (like Amneris on her first entry), various stages noises are also picked up during the set changes The balances are sometimes wrong too, in themselves and in relation with the camera work. Look at 21:05, camera shows Aida singing in duet with Radames (that's into the first choral scene of Act I) and you don't see Radames but you hear him sing louder and her voice sounds at a distance. There is the same kind of discrepancy, at least in Act I, between what you hear of the chorus - big - and what you see on stage, which is limited to the Priests. In those Act I choral scenes the stage is in fact curiously bare, contradicting the audio impression and its blasting ""Su del Nil"" and other ""Guerra guerra guerra"", and it is jarring; I suppose the main of the chorus was singing from the wings or in the pit. Jarring is also the fact that, in those moments of blasting chorus, you are served close shots on the soloists, see their lips moving but can hardly hear what they are singing (22:06). Nothing bothered me thereafter.

Granted, unlike one of, say, Cosi, a production of Aida will always be hard to film because, in its first two acts, it is not an intimate opera and a camera will always be better at close ups than at wide angles of an opera stage where, seen on your TV or computer screen, everything will seem dwarfed. Can't say director Derek Bailey has satisfactorily solved the problem, and made this into anything more than a souvenir of a night at La Scala for those who attended in the flesh.

Remain the principals, then, and the intimate scenes. I'm not sure Ronconi tried anything else but to assign positions on stage. Typical is the Act I trio, all three protagonists stand, a few steps apart, on a same line, and sing to the public. Pavarotti is vocally superb, radiant, with a clarity of timbre that recalls Bj&ouml;rling, both valiant and nuanced (beautiful decrescendo to piano on ""il ciel de' nostril amori"" at 1:48:25 in his Act III duet with Aida, or again ""t'avea il ciel per l'amor creata"" at 2:22:57 in the tomb scene - would that Del Monaco had ever been capable of that) even if the final B-flat of Celeste Aida is sung forte (but not trumpeting ala Del Monaco). His voice soars gloriously in the Act I consecration scene. I wonder why he omits his counterchant at the end of the Act IV Amneris duet, at 2:05:53, but it's a small detail. He makes no attempt at acting, at least in the sense of moving around stage, and it is better that way: the theatre in Verdi's Aida unfolds in the voices, not on the stage, and whatever (very discreet) facial expressions shown by Pavarotti are plenty enough to convey the emotions. More essential still: his acting is in his vocal characterization. Listen to the moment when he recognizes Amonasro in Act III, ""no, non &egrave; ver!"". It's great (1:53:50). Some reviewers find him too fat? But Ronconi and his costume-designer had the good sense not to dress him up in the customary pseudo-Egyptian mini-skirt but in a long robe that nicely conceals his generous contours, and when he returns in Act II on the triumphal chariot he looks regal enough. Frankly, I find Alagna or Domingo running around in an Egyptian tutu far more grotesque than Pavarotti's massive, statuesque presence. Too bad they left so much applause at the end of the arias, especially ""Ritorna vincitor"", Pavarotti and the camera crew are left stranded with not much to film. But even that he sustains well.

I find Dimitrova entirely convincing in the role of Amneris and avoiding the ridiculous facial antics of Ildiko Komlosi (with Alagna, Urmana and Chailly at La Scala again, twenty years later,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Aida/dp/B000PC1N54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi - Aida</a>) or Dolora Zajick (with Domingo, Millo and Levine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Aida-Levine-Domingo-Millo-Metropolitan-Opera/dp/B000050X2Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi - Aida / Levine, Domingo, Millo, Metropolitan Opera</a>. Her physical build-up is entirely suited to Pavarotti's and she doesn't even look fat - in fact I find her quite beautiful to look at, she reminds me of an actress of the silent movies era and I find it entirely appropriate. Like Pavarotti, her facial expressions remain confined to a minimum, but what we have carries all the expression needed. Try her wonderfully disdainful look at Aida in the Act II duet, at 49:30. It's great, I love it! I thought the close up on her at the beginning of Ramfis' accusations at Radames in the judgment scene superb (2:11:25), and I am sorry that the film director didn't have the balls to sustain that shot until the end of the scene. After all this is HER scene, not Ramfis', and she is infinitely more expressive than the terracotta wall or the back of Ramfis. Likewise, the camera beautifully picks up Amneris up there when she joins the Aida-Radames duet - again, too bad the film director didn't have the guts to leave it on her until the end, as if Radames and Aida were already in the other world (which is exactly what Verdi is telling us). I find Dimitrova and Pavarotti a pleasure to watch, precisely because they hardly do anything, but manage to make even that ""nothing"" hugely expressive - the opposite of Maria Chiara. I've read some negative comments about Dimitrova's purely vocal prowess - like: huge voice but no characterization. I don't hear that at all: I hear a huge voice and a great vocal characterization. Watching and listening, she seems to me the only Amneris able to compete with the memory of Rita Gorr (with Solti, Vickers and Leontyne Price in 1962,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Aida-L-Price--Vickers--Merrill--Gorr--Opera-di-Roma--Solti/dp/B0000041RW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi - Aida / L. Price  Vickers  Merrill  Gorr  Opera di Roma  Solti</a>). Incredible to think that she alternated (even in that production) the roles of Amneris and Aida. There are uploads on YouTube of her singing the Act II duet with Dolora Zajick or Ritorna Vincitor. The voice is sumptuous, regal, this is Turandot in captivity really, but I find that it lacks the element of innocence and frailty essential, IMO, to the character.

Speaking of whom... The first entrance of Aida/Maria Chiara, at 13:14, is absolutely ridiculous - she seems to be bizarrely tiptoeing, going from stage right to left, as if unaware of the presence of the two others or trying not to disturb, cartoon-like, and suddenly, oops! sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt... And the rest is worse. All her acting is over-emphasized, melodramatic, as if she were trying not to imitate but to caricature the style of the silent-movie actresses. Did Ronconi instruct her to do that (and not see how grotesque the result was) or is it her own thing and Ronconi couldn't stop her? My favorite: in her ""Ritorna vincitor"", when singing the lines ""oppressed and enslaved"", she crosses her two wrists as if in chains - just in case someone missed the subtitles! Every hand gesture is redundant. ""Per l'un..."" (right arm extended) ""...per l'altro"" (left arm). This isn't acting, this is sign language, semaphore. She looks old, too. Clearly, Radames didn't make the right choice here. I find her an embarrassment to watch from beginning to end. Hard to judge the voice and vocal characterization objectively when so much in the visual gets in the way. On her first entrance it seemed timbrally unseductive and forced, but if I shut my eyes and try to forget what I just saw, her Ritorna vincitor, her Act II duet with Amneris all sounded fine, perfectly acceptable for a one-off night at La Scala and maybe even better than that. Her Act III ""Patria mia"" was sung competently, but despite a much cleaner climactic high-C and final As, it certainly does not efface any memory of Maria Callas. Still, had I been at La Scala that evening, I would have joined the cheer (but maybe not as enthusiastically as the Italian audience). Her lower range lacked body at the beginning of her Act III duet with Radames but the final tomb scene was beautiful. But as long as I'm going to shut my eyes, I'd better go for the audio CDs.

Juan Pons' Amonasro is convincing enough, vocally and visually, although he lacks a touch of violence in his ""Su ! dunque, sorgete Egizie coorti"". Ghiaurov sings with a tattered voice and does little more than that: stand and sing. The staging of the looks of the four protagonists at each other, when the Pharaoh announces his wish to give his daughter's hand to Radames at the end of Act II (1:18:45), is well done. You understand Amonasro's later comment, in his Act III duet with Aida, that nothing escapes his attention.

Watching a video, one doesn't concentrate as much as when listening to a CD on the fine details of the conducting, but Maazel's seemed appropriate, with a small tendency at some points to be too grandiloquent, but overall always maintaining a proper dramatic flow.

I didn't buy this DVD, my local library had it. Seeing it gives me no incentive to want to have it permanently on my shelves - despite Dimitrova, and the fact that it was later reissued with a bonus DVD with a documentary on the making of Aida doesn't change the picture fore me,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aida/dp/B000JLQS7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aida</a>&nbsp;(especially given that it costs more, too). But it does give me incentive to want to buy the CD version, because Pavarotti and Dimitrova are vocally glorious and all the acting I need to see - yes, to see, not just to hear - is in their voices, and because I'll probably be better able to enjoy the singing of Chiara if I DON'T see her.",1349395200,,17217,4.951903114186851
7915953,4,B00002NDLW,I love this DVD for the fact that Pavarotti's singing is marvelous. AIDA was overacting the whole time but the Amneris was great. My biggest issue was the triumphal scene where I think the direcor over did it. That scene seemed to be overcrowded and a lot of confusing moving rocks behind the scenery. The conductor Lorin Maazel did a great job in conducting this marvelous piece. The Scala Chorus and Orchestra were also marvelous as always. One more thing....I always expect to see beautiful dancing during the ballet sessions of the opera but in this production there is no ballet at all. In one scene there were a whole bunch of kids jumping and running during Amneris longing for Radames whom she loves. During the triumphal scene the ballet was coreographed with slaves begging for food (whom they looked like hungry birds picking up breads)there was a soldier tossing breads at the slaves.....unbelievable!!!I didn't like this part. I thought it was confusing and out of context.,1302307200,,986,4.910179640718563
7915954,2,B00002NDLW,"Lots was written and I will keep mine short:

Good: Superb cast [stronger on the male side] with many of them at their pick. Good singing.

Not good: all the rest!

Visually disturbing production: Incredibly busy set [looks like Arizona not Egypt, by the way], less than pleasing costumes and set design.
Horrible Ballet scenes and even worse acting by some of the main characters [with trophy for worse actor divided between Pavarotti and Dimitrova].

Technically the recording is poor, uneven with even the smallest of background noises heard. One of the reviewers mentioned it is noticeable using his high-end headphones - I will argue it is true to listening on regular speakers [my DVD is connected to surround].

Last [and this is a question of personal taste]: I am totally unconvinced by Lorin Maazel's musical interpretation - it sounds to me as a pale, colorless Aida.

Two stars [instead of one] because of the cast - but it is not something I would keep in my library.",1272585600,,980,4.803571428571429
7915955,5,B00002NDLW,"Saw this one many years ago, didn't know the artists or anything. It always stuck in my heart. I have seen many other versions and they never moved me like this one. The final scene is something that has and will always stay with me. So glad to finally find this DVD.",1251158400,,267,4.153846153846154
