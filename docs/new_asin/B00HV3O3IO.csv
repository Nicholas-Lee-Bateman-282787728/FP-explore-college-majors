6228727,5,B00HV3O3IO,"Argo was a great American story! I remember being one of those individuals that said ""why can't we do something like the Canadians did!"".  Pretty boy Afflick was perfect as Tony Mendez. Very believable. He looked great in a beard too.
The Town was surprisingly good. A refreshing movie based on true events.  I would have bought it long ago if I'd known about it. Both movies are entertaining.",1467504000,,393,4.681159420289855
6228728,5,B00HV3O3IO,"Was able to use Argo in my US Military History class to show how the hostages were taken by the revolutionary guard, students never heard of the Hostage crisis so it was an eye opening experience.  They like the idea that Canada came to the rescue. The movie has some good qualities but for high school the language is a little harsh.  EPO'Donnell",1464048000,,347,4.492063492063492

8636233,5,B00HV3O3IO,Both dvd in great shape. The Town was pretty good though somewhat predictable. Argo on the other hand was very good. Great cast and original idea.,1523923200,,146,4.653846153846154

8636235,4,B00HV3O3IO,"Argo was a very interesting film to watch. I'm not sure how close the story follows actual events, but no matter it is still worth a close watch.  The town on the other hand was not as good for me because there was no ""happy ending,"" although, that did add interest to a movie that was plagued with exaggerated Boston/North Eastern US accents.",1493769600,,343,4.444444444444445
8636236,3,B00HV3O3IO,A movie not worthy of a second watch.,1493251200,,37,3.75
8636237,3,B00HV3O3IO,"I enjoyed watching Argo and in some ways it was somewhat suspenseful.  God Bless our great neighbors and allies to the north for placing themselves in such a precarious and very dangerous situation.

As far as The Town, it was just an add on and I don't think I cared for it very much, too much violence for my taste.",1489536000,,317,4.266666666666667
