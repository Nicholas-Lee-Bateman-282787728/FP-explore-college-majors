8623782,1,B00GJHHK42,"Where shall I begin? Patrick Kazo Tang and Johan Kirsten, I believe are the 2 main leads. Patrick is okay (I'm being real kind but his fight scenes moved him up a bit) Johan is possibly the dullest, worst, emotionless actor in the history of acting! Well, running a very close second or neck and neck is the woman who plays his dying mother (complete with makeup) in the hospital she should be charged with assault on my sensibilities too. she must be somebody's mother. This is a Well Go USA film and I usually enjoy them, what happened here? Let's recap...really bad acting, my dead grandmother could write better dialog the movie is just cheesy and not even fun cheesy, the support actors are a joke. confusing editing and the one good spot are a couple good fight scenes. By no means is that a recommendation. Run away!",1423872000,,823,4.530201342281879
8623783,3,B00GJHHK42,"""Dragonwolf"" is both the most ambitious and least effective feature that director Raimund Huber has made thus far. I'm a big fan of Huber's work, particularly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Em-All/dp/B008XEZXZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Em All</a>, but with this latest one, he's bitten off a bit more than he can chew. ""Dragonwolf"" swings somewhere between average and mediocre on the rating scale, though it's highlighted by a few inspired moments that helped earn this third star. It's weird, often incomprehensible, and sometimes pretty cool.

The story: gangster blood brothers Mozart (Patrick Tang,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raging-Phoenix/dp/B003LN0NXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raging Phoenix</a>) and Julius (John Kirsten) are set against each other by jealousy and vengeance in a lawless metropolis.

The biggest problem the feature has is its screenplay. The movie doesn't progress naturally or smoothly, and instead continually jumps between past and present in a very inharmonious and confusing way. So many things that are referenced and deemed important are simply introduced out of the blue, as though they were written into the screenplay at the last minute as per necessity (see the character Umiko). Other themes are introduced and then forgotten until you hardly remember them anymore (e.g. the shaman). Most noticeably, the filmmakers inconsistently and ham-handedly go for a stylized approach to the look and dialogue: characters spend a lot of time speaking in melodramatic prose (""And that, dear Mozart, is how you vanquish your enemies""), which is without much precedent but not so much as the random aesthetic decisions that are sometimes indulged, like the army of thugs Julius commands near the end of the picture all wearing white masks.

Still, I'd argue that the ideas in the movie could work and do work in the right situations - just not as a two-hour movie. In some cases, the melodrama comes across fantastically, like the final scene between Julius and his mother in the hospital (Bonnie Zellerbach). I was fuming at the ambiguity of the character motivations throughout, but these were all nicely explained in the end. This ""just wait for the good stuff"" approach also applies to the fight content, which begins as lackluster but eventually evolves into something innovative and cool. Patrick Tang is great as a performer but is still learning as a choreographer: none of the fights lack cool moves and every performer is very athletic, but so few of the moves convey much power and even fewer of the fights have a good narrative - the fighters just do a bunch of kicks and spins until someone drops. Luckily, these flaws are shed by the last third of the film at the latest, which showcases a spectacular two-on-one brawl featuring Brahim Achabbakhe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-of-Tai-Chi/dp/B00FEHCQYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man of Tai Chi</a>) and Anton Kalinitchenko (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Protector-2/dp/B00JVQ7PS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Protector 2</a>).

Frequent, obviously dubbed voices diminish the movie on a technical level, but it has enough energy and oddness going on that permissive viewers will be entertained until the end. Director Huber can do a lot better, but it's cool that he tried something out of the ordinary. I'm looking forward to his next movie, but hoping that it balances its style with its substance a little more.",1422144000,,3600,5.890804597701149

8623785,1,B00GJHHK42,"I made it into about 10 minutes of this movie.  The worst acting, really awful Kung Fu, and a bad story line.  I shut it down and deleted it from my play list.  Sorry actors, that was awful.",1410307200,2,190,3.9473684210526314

8623787,3,B00GJHHK42,"The plot is a big uncomprehensible mess with elements of silly magic. What others say about the dubbing/voice over issues is true. Comparison to Kill Bill is just due to some similar story and fight elements, including the fight scene of a Russian assassin a la Gogo Yubari. The martial arts choreography is excellent, but what spoils all Mozart's (main hero) fights, is the unrealistic voice over his presumably fighting exhales, those ""he"" and ""eh"" could have been muted, seriously. Besides they should have spent a bit more money on costumes, as Mozart (Kazu Patrick Tang) looked ridiculous in his over-sized baggy suit.",1406937600,,623,5.058252427184466
8623788,4,B00GJHHK42,"The story centers around two men. Mozart (Kazu Patrick Tang) who is the wolf. As a child he was saved by a Shaman at the cost of his mother's soul. When she died he was ""cared for"" by his ""brother"" Julius (Johan Kirsten) the Dragon, giving us the title. They became successful hitmen in the city of Devil's Cauldron. The story starts out confusing as Mozart is killing Julius' men to the displeasure of their mutual boss. Through a series of flashbacks we discover that Julius attempted to have Mozart killed over a love triangle involving Mary (Macha Polivka) a woman with a dragon tattoo.

The film is basically a Thai grindhouse. It includes some classically bad dubbing on a few of the minor characters. The two hour feature allows us to develop some complexity for the two main characters as we have scenes of Julius visiting his dying mother. Perhaps the downfall of the film is its genre mixing as a martial arts grindhouse and love drama, the latter of which wasn't done well. It also introduces a major character 90 minutes into the film to tie up some plot points.

The film had enough blood splatter and pretty girls to keep be entertained. Its haphazard flashback construction left me slightly confused for the early stages of the film. A soft 4 stars. Worth viewing for grindhouse fans.

Parental Guide: Not much swearing. There were a couple of  badly dubbed ""Mother Fo's"" And when I say Mother Fo I mean Mother Fo and not something that sounds like it. There was something that sounded like a quick F-bomb spoken by Julius when he first describes Mary's dragon tattoo. Sex scenes and a healthy amount of nudity including the main female leads Macha Polivka and Guk Srisawat.",1383955200,5,1689,4.6767676767676765
