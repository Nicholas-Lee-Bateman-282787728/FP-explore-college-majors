772833,5,6304059663,"Anyone that enjoys a good movie, a good western, that has ever enjoyed Gunsmoke, who has always believed in the values that Matt Dillon has always stood for, has to watch this installment of Gunsmoke.  Matt Dillon, ever  the presence of solidity, calmness, justice, and virtue once again shines  in ""The Long Ride"". Matt demonstrates cooperation with law  enforcement even though unjustly accused and when that same law let's him  down, without vigilance, he set's out to clear his name.  Ever the presence  and influencing others towards the paths of justice and right.  I watched  Gunsmoke as a child with my father, then it went off the air.  With  Gunsmoke videos and movies, I can share the virtues of Matt Dillon with my  son without being concerned of what the content is. Thanks, Matt.",961113600,25,793,4.835820895522388

Hard to replace a guy like James Arness and I suspect hollyweird will find that out really quick.",1506211200,,275,4.46

772989,5,6304059663,"Not the Matt Dillon of 1955 - 1975. There is no Dodge City in these movies with the exception of the first ""Return to Dodge"". No Festus, no Chester, no Mrs. Kitty, No Doc Adams. After James Arness left Gunsmoke in 1975 he went on to later do a series called ""How The West Was Won"" then an aging Arness (64 years old when he did the first movie) returned to the iconic role that made him famous. In this the fourth movie of five, Arness was around 70 years old. He was clearly too old for the part, but pulled it off nicely anyway. The movies take Matt in a different direction of of Dodge and onto a ranch, they give him a daughter he never knew he had. By this movie they are well acquainted. Arness is accused a of a murder he did not commit, and must prove his innocence. The movie is standard fare for Gunsmoke fans for the most part. Gritty and somewhat realistic as was the series in later years. James Brolin costars along with Ali McGraw. Arness was a great actor from a time that has come and gone. He had luck of being the star of a series that lasted for 20 years on television in this same iconic role. But,he is not the same Matt Dillon that we knew and loved from those days. He's older, wiser, and learned from experience over the years. He's, as he says ""Sick of the killing!""  I can understand why they held back these last two movies, I gave it 5 stars because it is Matt Dillon, but, Arness is just too old for the part here, and for years we only had the first three movies of the five available. I am glad however, to own these last two on DVD finally. But, I would have waited for them to come down so that I could pay less if I had known that Arness was just that far past due.

If you are a Gunsmoke fan like me, you will want to buy these dvds. If not, wait, I am certain they will come down in price at some point. Or come out as a muti-pack.",1497916800,5,1868,4.018817204301075
772990,5,6304059663,"I really enjoyed the tv long series of ""GUNSMOKE""...and have continued with the several of James Arness movies on DVD after he left Dodge City, but continues to attract gun fights, et al...all which makes these movies very enjoyable to a Western buff like me.  These are not for everyone, but if you are like me and enjoy the Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea, John Wayne, James Stewart, Audie Murphy westerns...then, you will like this one too.",1497916800,2,439,4.776315789473684

No one can question his acting ability which he proved with Gunsmoke the longest running show on TV ..20 years. All his other works are the same and he never deviates from being very good. Thankful we have his works to enjoy with his passing too soon. I recently read a book about him purchased from Amazon and it was so nice knowing of his life as a lad in Montana, serving his country ifonly briefly and his great acting career. Do not even hesitate to obtain THE LONG RIDE as it is worth it.",1495929600,,653,4.069767441860465

773489,5,6304059663,Gunsmoke movies are terrific.  I simply love James Arness's Gunsmoke movies.  They are always tastefully done & the story lines are very good.

773492,5,6304059663,"This engrossing movie has all the features of the best Westerns: taut dialogue, realistic action, great use of landscape and a script that allows character to develop while maintaining a high level of action. An aged James Arness convinces as a man still formidable with his fists and his guns despite his years and the supporting cast, including some charismatic bad men, is also very good. There are strong messages in the film about justice, goodness, the love of family, friendship and redemption. The violence is starkly portrayed and at times shocking. Some scenes will make the viewer's emotions flow and others drip with tension. Watch this and you will ride with the retired Marshall on every step of his journey. This is available on DVD in Australia.",1351900800,4,761,4.953125

773494,5,6304059663,"Matt Dillon is a retired US Marshal attending his daughter's wedding when two sheriff deputies ride up to arrest him for a murder and robbery. He is identified as the culprit by a man he once jailed. He is unable to prove his innocence because the local sheriff has been shot, is recuperating, and is indecisive. The district judge is no help because he is out of town and will not return for a week. The town people are riled up by the murdered man's son and come to hang him. Dillon rushes out of town in search of the real killers. He finds out that three men were involved in the robbery. He is pursued by a posse led by the murdered man's son who wants revenge. Dillon finds one of the three men who was left by the other two because he was badly wounded. His leg is infected by gangrene. Dillon saves his life by cutting off his leg. He finds the other two men and has to kill one of them in self defense. He captures the third man, but he too is killed trying to escape. Dillon's only hope to clear himself is the man he saved by cutting off his leg. He needs to bring him back alive and he needs to avoid Indians and the posse that is determined to bring him in dead.",1294012800,2,1175,4.090909090909091

773496,5,6304059663,"The fourth of the five Gunsmoke movies deals with the perennially
nasty possibility that law and justice can come into conflict.
A false witness puts ex-Marshal Matt Dillon into the type of danger
he had been notably skilled at disarming in his twenty years as US Marshal
of Dodge City. What should you do when law and justice apparently cannot
both be served? This movie shows the stark contrast between corruptible
New Mexico territorial lawmen, and the incorruptible Kansas peace
officer, retired.

An especially good movie for a new generation of Gunsmoke fans.",1218240000,5,565,5.075268817204301

7860661,5,6304059663,"The next to last Gunsmoke movie as a very elderly looking Matt Dillon is framed for a robbery and murder.  Matt escapes from the rather loathsome characters sent for him and must clear himself.  Even though James Arness looks quite old,  he can still shoot a gun and the action scenes are quite good.  James Brolin gives a surprisingly good performance as a minister, Matt rescues from some Indians, who assists Matt in his quest to clear his name.  Ali MacGraw, her movie star days behind her, is also excellent as a woman running a trading post in the middle of Indian territory that Brolin is in love with.  This is a suspenseful and exciting western with beautiful scenery.  A traditional and exciting western with the great James Arness.  My only complaint if the picture quality which sadly is quite grainy at times.  Other than that, as a fan who watched Gunsmoke as a little boy, from the late 1950s on, I enjoyed this film.",1516492800,,932,4.6
