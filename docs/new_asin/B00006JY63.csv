1783097,5,B00006JY63,"That quote was Arthur Daley reassuring Terry McCann that the minding business is still for him.  Minder, one of the best British shows in their tv history, has not had a region 1 release to date, so I am not sure why it is even listed here numerous times on Amazon, even though they all say ""unavailable"".  Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, and George Cole as Arthur Daley were teamed up for 7 seasons from 1979-1987.  It ran from 1979-1985 for series 1-6, and then had 3 years off before resuming one final year with McCann, on season 7.  Seasons 8-10 resumed with Arthur's nephew, played by Gary Webster, taking over for Terry McCann, but the chemistry of Waterman and Cole were what made this show such a phenomenon.  The later years, while receiving good reviews, could never be the same without Terry on the job.

Seasons 1 & 2 didn't receive high ratings on TV, and it wasn't until series 3 that the show finally became a hit.  They even went back and replayed seasons 1 & 2 after series 3 went over so well.  Aside from a few dull early episodes in Season 1, the rest of the episodes through season 6 were solid entertainment.  Most episodes revolved around Arthur finding some nearly crooked job for him and Terry to make a nice little earner, only for him to take most of the prize money in the end, citing expenses, overhead, and other reasons to con Terry out of his share.  Terry did get back at Arthur in several episodes, and more than once our lovable rogue con man ended up on the losing side of a profit.

Terry McCann was an ex-boxer and ex-con, two reasons to make him the best minder, or bodyguard, in London.  He often squared off against the right hand men and much-bigger-than-he hired hands of London underworld's most crooked citizens.  Of course, he would always find the time to romance the leading ladies who were tied up in his latest job.  Arthur's earners had Terry doing everything from minding Arab millionare's to minding women's dresses.

The comedic antics of George Cole really made him a legend of British TV.  Everyone during those years, and even now, knew who Arthur Daley was.  Arthur and Terry usually hung out at the Winchester Club, run by Arthur's old mate, Dave, but Dave hated it when Arthur would bring his business inside and rough up his club.  Dave was the only other regular character in Minder, besides Terry and Arthur.  There were also the minor characters of Des, Terry's car thief friend, the on-the-take Inspector Rycott, and the righteous Inspector Chisolm, who all made numerous appearances in the show.

There were two Region 2 Specials released on DVD, along with the movie, Minder on the Orient Express.  Seasons 1-10 are out on Region 2 DVD, and if you can find the now out of print Region 4 DVD's from Australia, they made seasons 1-3, but featured uncut episodes with their original ad break captions, and on seasons 1 & 3, you got none other than George Cole featured on some audio commentary.  The British Region 2 dvd's are very short on extras.  I am not sure it will ever get a region 1 release, so you may have to seek out the foreign discs, if you have the capability to play them.  If you do, you will reap the rewards of getting to see arguably one of the best British tv shows of all time.",1135728000,6,3265,4.504244482173175

7970830,5,B00006JY63,"George Cole is Arthur Daly, a man who knows ""a nice little earner"" when he sees one, even if it is a bit dodgy.  Arthur hires Terry McGann (played by Dennis Waterman of ""New Tricks"") to be his minder - British English for personal bodyguard.  The humor arises from the relationship between the two and from the fact that former boxer and ex-con Terry has a real talent for coming up with non-violent solutions through reasoning.

They have more extras than the Region 2 releases, however I have noticed on some episodes, that the picture quality isn't as good as the Region 2 discs.  You will find the Minder Specials and The Minder On The Orient Express as extras on these Region 4 season sets, rather than sold separately like the Region 2 releases.

I am not sure Minder will ever get a region 1 release, so you may have to seek out the UK or Australian discs, if you have the capability to play them.
