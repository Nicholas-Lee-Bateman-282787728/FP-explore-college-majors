1410934,4,B00005A1VF,"John Houston's story of a young Union soldier who overcomes his fear of battle is wonderful. Audie Murphy's portrayal is stirring and quite lifelike, the movie doesn't portray any super human motives, but a simple soldier who is quite naturally scared going into battle and overcomes his fear. However, Houston doesn't allow Murphy's character to get into excessive machoism either, as he finds out that many of his comrades did the same thing he did, turn and run. Had the movie execs not chopped this movie up, it could have been even better. As it is, it's a bit too short and lacking in details such as the battles portrayed in the movie patterned after a real battle. The unit portrayed isn't even mentioned until the end of the movie. It would have been fun to follow Murphy's character's unit through the war.",1045267200,8,816,4.713286713286713
1410935,4,B00005A1VF,"The purely psychological aspect of this film -- not only about fear on the combat field, but of being afraid of being afraid -- is great. The young men really personify a young man's innate fear of failure, fear of death, fear of combat and fear of being a coward. ""He was a real Jim Dandy,"" an unknown soldier says of the ""Tall soldier,"" who, for the purposes of the movie personifies what a REAL soldier should be -- brave, willing to give his life, going on until there is no energy left in him. But the main character personifies every human -- outwardly trying to act the part expected of him, and inwardly doubting himself. This movied really touched me. Stephen Crane's portrayal is brought to light in such a vivid way.",1017705600,5,727,4.473684210526316
1410936,5,B00005A1VF,"John Huston directed this film adaptation of the famous Steven Crane
novel. As soon as it was finished, he left to work on The African
Queen, leaving the editing in the hands of the studio. But it was
1951, the height of the McCarthy era. There was a movement in this
country against anti-war films. And so the film was cut to a mere 69
minutes, which put it into the category of a ""B"" movie to be
shown only as a second feature. That was a full fifty years ago, and
in spite of the supposed butchering job on the cutting room floor, the
film definitely has stood the test of time. Of course I will never
know what the original was supposed to be. And I haven't even read the
novel. But I sure am glad I saw this video.
 I understand that Steven
Crane wrote the book in 1894, which was a full thirty years after the
Civil War. He was 22 years old at the time and had never actually been
in a battle himself. He was trying to say something about war and
courage and human nature rather than about the specific war. And so
his work is unique among the vast body of writings about that awful
period of history that tore at the heart and soul of our
country.
 Audie Murphy stars as The Youth and, with the exception of
Andy Devine who has a small role lasting no more than a minute, the
rest of the cast are unknowns. They all portray Union soldiers and we
first see them bored and anxious to fight a battle. They brag about
their courage and how they all intend to stand firm in the heat of
battle. The Youth has his doubts and the tension mounts as the
inevitable battle tests them all. Frightened, The Youth flees. Later
though, he returns and proves his manhood. The story is as simple as
that.
 There is also a narrator in the story, reading excerpts from the
pen of Steven Crane. The language is beautiful and adds depth to the
simple conversations of the soldiers. The black and white photography
is grainy and much of it is shot in shadow, adding to the intimacy and
the authenticity of the film. There was a literary rhythm to it all
and it added intensity.
 The role called for excellent acting and Audie
Murphy was perfect. I understand that in real life he won national
fame as the most decorated GI in WW2, winning 45 medals. He led a
turbulent life, plagued by what is now known as post traumatic stress
syndrome. A compulsive gambler, he won and lost fortunes, was addicted
to prescription sleeping pills and was once acquitted of attempted
murder charges stemming from a fistfight. But all that came later. In
1951, he was perfect for the role of The Youth. Recommended",998956800,41,2581,4.3264462809917354
1410937,4,B00005A1VF,"It is said that the executives at MGM took away this film from director John Huston, since the issue of anti-heroism in war was unpopular, particularly at the time of McCarthyism and the action in Korea. Based on Stephen Crane's novel set in the Civil War, this tale of a Union Army youth who's fear makes him flee from the battleline, actually gets a patriotic rejuvination when the youth overcomes his understandable state of being a ""mental outcast"" and rejoins his unit. Some may see his subsequent bravery as overcompensation, since one wonders just how important it is to have the flag ahead of the troops in an advance. The youth's genuine sensitivity is juxtaposed with the phony crowing of the other soldiers, some naive, most expressed to conceal their own fear. It's remarkable that as the youth, Audie Murphy conveys an emotionalism that is lacking in his later Western career. One senses that the music by Bronislau Kaper is studio imposed, but the narration with excerpts from the book may well be Huston's contribution, considering he did the same thing with The Bible. Whoever decided on the readings, they are a mistake since Crane's writing is embarassingly awful. Huston stages the battle scenes with a formal elegance that also captures the general stupidity of the activity. He reduces the Rebels into howling Indians from a stock Western, but the enveloping smoke and the images of sunlight coming through treetops at dusk are strikingly beautiful.",986428800,9,1470,5.004081632653061

The script and narration borrows heavily from the book which I liked (""He had made his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man""). The dialogue between the soldiers reflects the language of the Victorian era and adds much realism to the film. Bill Mauldin is a standout as the boy's friend. My favorite scene is of the Union General on the white horse, riding along the line before battle, asking the men about dinner .... just banter to relieve tension.

1410998,5,B00005A1VF,"John Huston was one of the finest American directors and this film demonstrates why.  The camera work is sublime and the acting superb.  Huston clearly had a vivid sense of the heart of Stephen Crane's classic novel and was able to translate the powerful language into poetic imagery on the screen.  Audie Murphy was also terrific in the lead role of Henry Fleming.  I highly recommend this to aficionados of fine cinema, though I would have loved to have seen the full movie as intended by Huston.  Hollywood may have ""butchered"" it in Huston's eyes, and softened anti-war sentiments, but they still left a choice cut of meat for us.  A great film.",1442534400,2,649,4.699115044247788

Crane's Maggie a Girl of the Streets is also a masterpiece of humanistic literature that draws light to the plight of normal human beings caught up in economic or political circumstances they had no direct participatory say in (either you're drafted into the war or born into poverty) yet it ends badly for them back then, and it ends badly for them today, just don't imagine you'll see it on TV.

Filmed in black and white , the story moves along very quickly, but neither variable negatively affects the quality of either the story line or the impact thereof.

Some truly excellent movies have been made regarding the details of the combat, but The Red Badge of Courage explores some of the equally crucial psychological impacts of combat.

The film represents the transformation of a young soldier from apparent cowardice to battlefield courage.

I've never tired of it, and I think it's because of the unadorned directness and simplicity of the overall production.  The movie is like a  didactic history class documentary, but with folksy flavor and humor added in.  The main actors, Audie Murphy & Bill Mauldin, weren't professional actors, but were, just a mere six years earlier, soldiers on the front lines in Europe, where Murphy was a decorated hero, and Mauldin was one of the best illustrators of the 20th century.  The supporting cast was made up of professional actors and they helped tremendously to carry the story along.  But there was no glorification of war or politics similar to the classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" and that helps to identify with these common and ageless soldiers.",1403568000,3,837,4.818181818181818

I would love to see the ""director's cut"" but alas the edited-out potions have apparently been lost over time. In addition to the story from Crane's novel - which is still a fairly faithful adaption even with the editing - and Huston's masterful direction, the film showcases a very young Audie Murphy, one of the most decorated soldiers of WW II; and Bill Mauldin, the WW II cartoonist of ""Willie and Joe"" fame. They both account for themselves quite well. The support casting is also spot on; and Huston's use of B&W film noir cinematography to simulate the horrors of battle is innovative.

It is a short book that really gets in the psyche of a young man who goes to war with images of glory, and finds the reality far different. But in the end, he pulls it together and fulfills what he believes to be his duty. If you know anything about the conditions of the average civil war soldier, it makes this story all the more powerful.

The title Red Badge of Courage refers to the badge given soldiers who are wounded, what is called today, a purple heart. Henry Fleming is the youth who is deadly afraid, especially frightened of becoming a coward and running away during the battle. Ironically, he is played by Audie Murphy the most decorated hero of World War Two. The narration in the film is quotes from Crane's masterpiece, a book written when Crane was only twenty-two years old. His language is superb. Murphy plays his part superbly. Viewers can see the fear in his face and gestures. The direction of the film is excellent, as is the scenery, and the acting by the supporting cast.

During the first attack by the confederate soldiers, the youth was firm. But then, during the second attack, when many of his fellow union soldiers turned and ran, he ran too. He ran around the periphery of the battle field and was hit on the head by another union soldier who was running away. He went back to his unit somewhat dazed, not knowing where else to go, and claimed that he had been fighting on the right flank, and that he was shot in the head. No one had seen him running, so no one knew that he had acted cowardly.

The unit is ordered to attack, and the youth, without thinking, rushes to the front to fire at the enemy soldiers. Then when the flag bearer falls dead, the youth lays down his rifle, takes up the flag, rushes to the front, and leads the unit with shouts of encouragement. His unit wins the battle, people talk of the youth's heroism, he turns from a youth into a man; but, as it is in life, a general who was not anywhere near the youth during the battle, got all the credit.",1289260800,2,1835,4.378299120234604

This is a classic anti-war novel brought to life. It examines the darker side of war at the ""average soldier"" level. The characters start off proud and patriotic, but lose courage quickly when confronted with the gruesome truths of combat. It portrays well the inner struggles of the warrior.

Eventually, overcoming his fears, the main character takes up the falling ensign, and leads his comrades in a death defying charge.

The main role is played by a young Audie Murphy, a real-life hero from World War II. He played in several productions, but this is probably his best performance.

It is definately not ""politically correct."" One yankee quotes, ""a dog, a woman and a (almond?) tree; the more you beat them, the better they be."" A sentiment from another era to be sure.",1274572800,2,796,4.830882352941177

1411220,5,B00005A1VF,"Only after watching this movie did I realize that Audie Murphy is the most decorated soldier in WWII and hence an excellent choice for portraying a war hero. This movie is unusual in two aspects.

First, the theme may not be politically correct then - the reflection of a soldier amid battles of combat. Yet it echoes well with the present sentiments about a war - whether or not it is worth fighting in the first place. Thus, this movie was different from the war movies made back in the 40s and 50s where courage and good cause come naturally. The movie would have been much better received if it was to be released now.

Second, the cinematography is excellent and the combat scenes of the civil war in the open land are well captured. Apart from a brief appearance of a young woman as the Army marched past the civilians' residence, the movie showed only the soldiers and the not so advanced machinery. John Huston's fingerprints were all over the film with his signature portrayal of someone ordinary caught in the middle of something big (like Humphery Bogart in African Queen) The movie reveals the vulnerability of human beings and that courage develops over time. A fresh break from the present heavy armoured, special effects laden movie",1191369600,4,1247,4.715596330275229
1411221,2,B00005A1VF,"Stephen Crane's ""Red Badge of Courage "" is a sublime psychological study of fear in the face of war, and the way one young man deals with fear -- through flight, bravado, exaggeration and finally, self-confrontation and calm determination. Though the action takes place in one of the most extroverted of possible historical settings -- the American Civil War -- the real warfare takes place in Fleming's psyche. Unfortunately, John Huston was not equal to the task of applying a visual narrative that could convincingly depict the roiling chaos going on in protagonist Henry Fleming's soul. About all he could manage was to put Henry in a few conventional situations and have him knit his brow and bite his lips to communicate his inner turmoil. Audie Murphy, the decorated WWII vet, and Bill Mauldin, the respected war cartoonist and creator of Willie and Joe, were cast in the lead roles. They are likeable and sometimes rise to the level of having a real relationship. But ultimately, their real-world experience doesn't do much to prop up the threadbare narrative. The stilted delivery and wooden acting of much of the cast is a real impediment to enjoying this film. On the plus side, it's daring to portray the baseless bravado and fear experienced by the ordinary soldier. But the profusion of standard Hollywood types, the overwrought and self-important narration, and the unnecessary re-arrangement of Crane's plot combine to muddle the story arc and render the film ineffective.

Although it too suffers from the set piece mentality -- in which characters are pitted mechanically against one crisis after another -- Huston's next film, African Queen, stands out as such a classic. Reason: the sterling acting abilities of Bogart and Hepburn pulled the film through in a way that (sadly) Murphy, Mauldin and others cannot.

The DVD extras are skimpy -- comprising the theatrical trailer and a static listing of the cast. But one extra is fascinating. After comparing RBOC to ""Gone with the Wind,"" (not!) the trailer makes the most lunkheaded claim I have ever seen in film. To paraphrase: ""In years to come, The Red Badge of Courage will be as memorable as The Birth of a Nation!"" Comparing one's work to a film that glorified the KKK is a feat so bizarre that it stands as a monument to the social blindness of the film's marketers and their era.

Huston's ""Red Badge of Courage"" is disappointing, plodding and barely worthwhile as a way to visualize the events of the book. The best one can say about it is that it could have been worse. Until a better adaptation is produced, RBOC is a work that should be experienced in one form only: the printed page.",1183334400,,2665,4.865638766519824
1411222,4,B00005A1VF,"""Red Badge Of Courage"" was a film destined to fail from its inception. Louis B. Mayer never wanted the picture to be made and did what he could to discourage the process. He felt it could never be a commercial success without female characters or established stars. Mayer expressed his views directly to John Huston, he said, ""It has no story and won't make a cent!""

When the film was finally completed, the test screenings were a failure. Houston remarked: ""With the Red Badge of Courage, I quite understood at the time why they took the steps they did. I was present at a preview when damn near a third of the audience got up and walked out of the theatre.""

Various edits were tried without the participation of Huston, who was working on the ""African Queen"" with Bogart and Hepburn, and seemed to not give a damn. All that resulted was a picture that got shorter and shorter. The final release version is 69 minutes. The original cut was of 95 minutes, not two hours as has been suggested.

""...they cut out one scene that was probably the best in the picture, in a way of anticlimax. The monumental death of the tall soldier. The boy and the tattered soldier walk away down the hill, and the tattered fellow says, ""I've never seen a feller die like that."" He begins to ramble and begins to walk around in circles then dies himself. This was the most extraordinary moment in the picture as far as I was concerned. It wouldn't have made any difference so far as the audience was concerned. They still walked out in the middle of the picture.""

The footage that was extracted was from the master negative. It was discarded to the floor of the editing suite and thrown away as useless. There are no records of any of the cut scenes or extra footage surviving.

Louis B. Mayer dispatched a second unit to Huston's ranch. The second unit was to film the battle scenes in Technicolor using the Cinematographic process: MGM Camera 65. Louis B. Mayer, at his most vindictive, shot footage that would eventually be used in future productions with the full knowledge of Huston.

As the problems mounted, Huston's enthusiasm for the project waned and he started to gravitate towards his next project. Huston never re-visited ""Red Badge Of Courage"". It is assumed he was never happy with the film in its original form or its release version and was happy for the film to fade into annals of film history.",1181692800,5,2397,4.588785046728972

You see the fear of battle in him and you can feel it through the screen also. His reaction to cannon and rifle fire remind me of my uncle who served in Nam and how he reacted to the sounds of battle after that. In this day and age of DVD's someone should try to find the lost footage to this and re cut it like Mr. Huston wanted it done so we can all see that Mr. Murphy was more than just a hero, he was a very talented actor who wasn't given the due he should have gotten while he was with us.",1174867200,3,861,3.9826589595375723

However, the movie left me feeling flat. The book goes into so much more detail about how the young soldier was feeling, and in this movie, you really don't understand his motivations. The book is not about any particular battle in the war, it's about the struggle insdie the young soldier's head, and it's difficult to communicate that in a movie.  There is a ""thrift edition"" of the book that doesn't cost much. I recommend reading the book instead of watching the movie.  Or better yet, read a real anti-war novel written by someone who was really in a war:  ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" by Erich Remarque.",1164499200,,770,4.639705882352941

Huston had filmed two battle scenes, though they were combined into one by the film editors; it's still the highlight of the picture and among the best battle scenes ever filmed, thanks mainly to the excellent photography by Harold Rosson. The original version that Huston shot is apparently lost forever, but this shortened one is still an excellent piece of movie making. Because the movie was so short, the studio sent it out as a ""B"" picture; considered as such it's probably the best ""B"" picture ever made.",1148169600,5,925,4.817610062893082

The battle scenes are quite good for the period in which they were filmed and certainly have a more realistic feel than some of the battle scenes depicted in more recent Civil War ""epics"".

This movie doesn't focus its attention on who was right or wrong on either side. It simply tells the story of one Union private's struggle to master his fears and serve his regiment with courage and honor.

And as readers may guess from my review title, my favorite moment in this film is when Private Fleming and his comrades ask where their newly captured Confederate prisoners hail from. This meeting of boys from Ohio with boys from Tennessee is a very moving moment and speaks volumes about the American Civil War. Set aside the politics, the need to sanctify the cause of either side and you are left with the boys, North and South, hailing from states that were in those years every bit their country, for which they were more than willing to lay down their young lives.",1139443200,7,1317,4.576271186440678
1411237,5,B00005A1VF,"The Youth (Audie Murphy) finds his first taste of battle to be more than he'd bargained for.

Although it's over fifty-years-old, John Huston's adaptation of Stephen Crane's THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE holds up remarkably well. Crane's novel of youth, written when Crane was in his early twenties, is an exploration of the nature of courage as measured in the crucible of battle.  Civil War battle, to be exact.  The Youth - that's how he's listed in the credits - along with the Loud Soldier (Bill Mauldin,) the Tall Soldier (John Dierkes,) and the rest of his regiment are marching to the battlefield shortly after the movie opens.

 The `red badge' in the title is a battle scar, proof to the world - and yourself - that you have sufficient courage to belong.  Whether that type of physical courage is today so highly and universally esteemed is debatable.  Certainly Mauldin and especially Murphy, two still-youth heroes of the Second World War, won't resonate with later audiences.  Mauldin enlisted in the army in 1940, and while in the service created the cartoon characters Willie and Joe, two average GIs fighting in Europe.  Willie and Joe appeared in Stars and Stripes and won for Mauldin the Pulitzer Prize in 1945.  Murphy was the most decorated combat American combat soldier of the war. Mauldin and Murphy's real-life courage was unquestioned, and Huston's use of the two in lead roles in canny.  It adds a unique layer of immediacy and realism to the story.

 There's a loose-limbed, deep focus, tight close-up look to the film that puts us under the skin of our universal Everyman soldiers.  Murphy always seemed somewhat stiff as an actor, but here Huston keeps the dialogue short and concentrates on the darting eyes and pursed lips of the unproven youth.  It works surprisingly well.  THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE is famous as a butchered film, one the studios took from the director and cut by some twenty minutes.  In fact, the running time for this one is a little over an hour, more suitable for a Boston Blackie episode than a major feature release.  Huston, the story goes, was outraged but diverted by preliminary work on his next project, The African Queen.  This is probably all so, but whoever did the re-cut knew what they were doing.  The finished product is a trim, muscular story that benefits from its brevity.",1133827200,17,2338,4.7975

1411239,5,B00005A1VF,"This movie is a Matthew Brady photo come to life.  While it is true that the leads, Audie Murphy and Bill Mauldin, were not professional actors, they were cast for their wonderful faces and the fact that they had actually been through a recent war.  Considering what Murphy had been through, his innocence and boyishness is a joy to behold.  And they are surrounded by pros such as Andy Devine, Bill Easton and Royal Dano - as well as the usual Huston cronies.  It has many moving vignettes - the captured Rebs being questioned by their Yankee peers, Andy Devine, as the jolly soldier, leading Murphy back to his unit, the General falling to prayer before battle, Murphy confessing his cowardice to Mauldin, the General promising to have supper with the men, etc...

The narration was added later because the studio had no confidence in Murphy being able to convey the story. This was years before Hollywood understood how effective non-professionals could be if directed properly.  The studio also hated the General's high-pitched voice and so dubbed in a different actor and, of course, the complete butchering of whole scenes which reduced the movie to about 55 minutes.

Sticking Audie Murphy in films just because he was a war hero didn't always work. He was only a fair to middling actor and trundling Bill Mauldin out was a major mistake. Mauldin should have stayed at the drawing board. Historical accuracy doesn't exist in either version. Uniforms, weapons, etc are all typical Hollywood, and while this doesn't entirely detract from the story, it does dampen the effect. Maybe a director will re-make this one.

1411242,4,B00005A1VF,"Is this a post-WWII patriotic vehicle or is it a true adaptation of Crane's powerful and ground-breaking story?
The story is NOT about heroism.  Frankly, I was surprised to see this film was made so soon after WWII and right at the beginning of the Korean War.  Crane's novel is one of the great anti-war pieces ever written, ranking with ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""  So is this film to be likened to ""Apocalypse Now"" or more like ""The Green Berets""?  Sadly, I fear the latter, if the spin on the trailer is accurate.  Comparing it to ""Birth of a Nation"" would suggest that it is thought of as a patriotic vehicle rather than a message film.  I thought maybe John Huston himself had the courage to film this story the way Crane intended it, but of course it is up to the viewer to ""get it"" or not.
Crane's work is a naturalistic rendering of the inhumanity of war.  It is not about becoming a hero -- it is about a soldier who begins as an isolated and fear-filled boy but through the horrors of war becomes part of the ""war machine.""  It is not about the glory of war; it is about the loss of humanity that war demands of its participants.  In the end, even after acts of ""bravery"" the soldier wants to go home and flee warfare altogether.
It is ironic that Audie Murphy, one of the highest decorated soliders of WWII, is playing the young soldier.  I wonder how many WWII veterans watching this film related to the fear and the sense of inhumanity presented at the core of the story.
But of course, the Civl War is held in a different context than WWII, perhaps rightly so.  The enemy here is quite different than Nazi troops, or is it?  Read or watch ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" if you want to explore that question further.
The film itself is well-made.  Huston's direction is quite good, with some interesting camera angles and great cinematography.  The censored language is quaint now, but the overall feel is still one of comeraderie and some realism.  Newcomers Murphy and Mauldin both hold their own quite well.  It is great to see Andy Devine and even William Schallert in supporting roles.  As for the DVD, I would like to have seen more extras and more notes on the production itself -- were the actors just that or were they early re-enactors?
Overall it works as a war movie, I just wonder which side of war this movie really is supporting.",1066780800,6,2366,4.439814814814815

It begins with Union troops marching along a road in September 1862. They stop by a river. There is a rumor about action. What will the soldiers do? Stand or run? Henry Fleming does sentry duty along the river at night. The soldiers perform their drill. Then they are ordered to march out. Henry talks about the fighting. The soldiers cross a chest-deep stream. They hear gunfire, then see a dead soldier. They advance into the woods, then are ordered to double-step. The Colonel orders them to take the hill. Union soldiers run away, the Rebs advance. They must hold the line. They fire and reload. Keep firing! orders their officer. The Rebs retreat. The Union wounded leave for the rear. The Rebs attack again, some of the Union soldiers run away.

This second charge is held. Henry talks to Jim, who got shot. Another soldier guides Henry back to his regiment. Other men were scattered but returned. What will they do today? The Rebels attack, the Union soldiers fire volleys. Henry runs in front until an officer orders him to return. They fill their canteens from the creek in the rear. Their regiment will reinforce where the attack is expected. They are ordered to attack. Men fall. Rebel soldiers are captured, they are from Tennessee (the Union soldiers are from Ohio). The Union soldiers are marched to a new location. Henry is content.

Stephen Crane wrote this novel in 1894 at age 22, based on the stories he heard from actual veteran soldiers. Crane later died of tuberculosis, the #1 killer of people who were in the prime of life. Audie Murphy was a sharecroppers son from a small town east of Lubbock, Texas. He was the most decorated US soldier of WW II. This is worth watching once, it is a low budget movie that takes place in a few days. Note how the Union soldiers fired their guns while half of them reloaded. The movie To Hell and Back is a better movie and more educational as well. Too bad it has been banned from most broadcast TV stations since the 1980's.",1480636800,,2022,4.580110497237569
