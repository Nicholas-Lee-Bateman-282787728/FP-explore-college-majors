4857779,2,B005PYEQH4,"Had a headache by the end of the movie--as one reviewer said, the white subtitles on a mostly white background are incredibly hard to follow.

Was an ok movie, including elements of a love relationship between 2 obese characters, and giving a good review of the japanese sport of sumo.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 for a fairly entertaining and unique plot and the several funny scenes(mostly all funny because of the fat person/ppl involved).

 I didn't like how they used Sumo to show the opinion that obesity overall is an ok thing.  I don't agree with the overall message of the movie that it is ok and perhaps even enjoyable/desirable to be fat/obese.

It saddens me that so many ppl are now obese, you don't even have to include the ""just overweight"" ppl that are headed in the direction of obesity as I write this.  I suppose I would have enjoyed it more if I was part of this crowd bc I might not feel as bad about myself.  Yes,  a handful of people (probably literally a handful) in the world make a living out of being obese (sumo wrestlers).  That does NOT make it healthy or an acceptable or ideal way to live for the rest of us.",1346284800,,1144,4.328638497652582
4857780,4,B005PYEQH4,"This is , as advertised, a very good movie-funny & poignant at times.  Since it is in Hebrew, the sub-titles play an important role in its viewing.  They are in white print, throughout the movie, which is fine for when there is a dark background, but unreadable when the background is light.  Much of the dialogue is missed, & must be gleaned from context.",1326412800,7,356,4.53125
4857781,4,B005PYEQH4,Charming comedy about people well into their lives recognizing and beginning to accept who they are. (And not just in the ways you might expect.),1322092800,3,145,4.84
4857782,5,B005PYEQH4,"I had the pleasure of seeing this movie when it premiered at the Jerusalem Film Festival in 2009, and it was a sensation.  I was able to bring family and friends to see it in 2010 at an American film festival, where it received a standing ovation.  This film is funny and sweet and beautifully acted.  If you can imagine people from a sort of Overeaters Anonymous group trying to create a sumo wrestling team in Israel, you'll see where the humor comes from.  There's romance and sadness and friendship. A true feel-good movie.  Highly recommended.",1321747200,4,548,4.666666666666667
4857783,3,B005PYEQH4,"we cannot believe that there are no English subtitles.  We were totally misled by the showing of  the Hebrew title with the English translation. And none of the customer reviews nor did the product description say only ""in Hebrew"".  Zeh lo tov!!!!!  Is there a version with English subtitles?",1304467200,4,292,4.8979591836734695
4857784,4,B005PYEQH4,"I'm a big fan of Israeli cinema - they put out more quality films per capita than any other country in the world, in my opinion.

Those films are populated by striking, magnetic stars like Lior Ashkenazi, Ronit Elkabetz, Aya Koren, Oshri Cohen, Ohad Knoller and Dana Igvy.

'A Matter of Size' goes in the other direction from striking and magnetic, filling the screen with a cast of characters whose weight and depression have congealed into tight, downward trajectories in life.  Enter the unlikely uplift of sumo wrestling, leading to a series of jarring, well-played cinematic juxtapositions of Israeli/Japanese cross-cultural scenes.  These are two countries rarely thought about in the same book chapter let alone sentence, and it's this distance that is the impetus for much of the film's understated humor.  Sumo wrestling here is more of a metaphor for acceptance.  Its presence takes the characters from a position of social outcasts to one in which their physiques are not only accepted but rewarded.  In fact, it's the bigger, the better.  Though he never loses his morose countenance, sumo's effect is most transformational on Herzl, winningly played by Itzik Cohen.

That this movie was elected Israel's best comedy of 2009 doesn't say a lot for Israel's ability to churn out comedies.  [That list from above is notable by its dramatic appeal.]  But this is a enjoyable movie...probably a three-star experience by itself, but worth four stars to someone like me who is always on the lookout to expand my knowledge of Israel's cinematic solar system (I get a kick out of linking the stars from one movie to the next).",1294444800,2,2889,7.882716049382716
8482773,5,B005PYEQH4,I really liked this movie. This movie is about learning to love yourself even if you are not the ideal size society deems to be acceptable. The characters start off in a weight loss program run by a less than nice weight loss counselor who uses degradation as a tool for losing weight. The main character decides he is done with self loathing and will turn his weight into a positive by becoming a Sumo Wrestler.,1525219200,,412,4.434210526315789

8482778,5,B005PYEQH4,"HAHAHAHA!!!!  This is terrific!!  Hilarious but very touching.  Four overweight guys, who are Israeli and who don't feel accepted for various reasons, become sumo wrestlers after one of them, who works in a Japanese restaurant, sees sumo wrestling broadcast on TV.  He notices how respected and even revered the wrestlers are and begs the owner of the restaurant to coach them.  He reluctantly agrees to do this, and they get into all kinds of hilarious situations.  Their sadness at not feeling accepted gradually gives way to confidence as they slowly make progress.  Then they decide to enter a sumo tournament!  In the meantime, a sweet beautiful heavyset girl becomes attracted to one of our sumos.  I'm dying to tell you more but I think you should watch it for yourselves.  It is in Hebrew but is subtitled in English.  I loved it and I recommend it.",1407888000,,857,4.801369863013699

8482781,4,B005PYEQH4,"What happens when your weight watchers group kicks you out because you never lose weight, when your mother chides you over your size as she continues to feed you, and you lose your job because your size generates complaints?

For the main character in A Matter Of Size, you find a new job, discover a girlfriend who doesn't complain about your size, move out of your mother's apartment, and... discover sumo.

This film is centered in Israel, which is not known as a hotbed of sumo.  Nevertheless, a group of friends begins to train, with all engaging upon a journey of self-discovery.

Mostly in Hebrew, with English subtitles.  The subtitles are sometimes very hard to read when the background is light, but you will still get the point of the scenes.",1374451200,,753,4.717557251908397
8482782,3,B005PYEQH4,"Thirty five year old Israeli Jews from different sexual practices try frantically to lose their hips while embracing sumo proves more achievable.

It's unclear to what extent their sport gains to be competitive in Japan but sending a message of take-it-if-it's-impossible-to-change-it dismantles some funny realities of the Jewish State more and  more being transferred into a multinational shtatle of a Middle Eastern origin.
