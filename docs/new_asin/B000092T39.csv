The DVD is off the hook, even though it's, music videos y'all have seen on the television. This gives you the opportunity to see it when you like, just think, you come from a stessfull day and you want to see B2K in action....BLAM slam in your DVD!!!
The special cuts are heavy as well, if you like B2K it's all gravy....(except for the kiss with Jennifer but n-e who) you get to see the full length features of the video of ""Girlfriend!"" you damn skippy you should cop it.
COP IT, ITS MORE THAN WORTH THE MONEY!! IT'S EVERY GIRLS NECESSITY IF YOU A TRUE B2K FANATIC!!
HOLLA i'm outro,
::Walks out of post:::
B2K is HOT la, la ,la, la!",1069372800,6,794,4.371621621621622
7988708,4,B000092T39,"This DVD includes the videos for Girlfriend, Bump, Bump, Bump, Gots to Be, Why I Love You and the alway fabulous Uh-Huh. There are actually three versions of the Girlfriend music video on this DVD. I would have given it five stars however the Bump, Bump, Bump video features too much of Puff Daddy. Way too much! It's more like Puff featuring B2K instead of the other way around. You won't get tired of watching this disc, though. The guys look fine as always, their gear is banging and their moves are tight. You'll love it.",1054857600,11,525,4.479166666666667
