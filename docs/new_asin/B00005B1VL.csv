1419803,4,B00005B1VL,"I just finished watching these two instalments of the ongoing series and was enthralled.  A&E has certainly lived up to its name in creating such as rich and colorful series with it's lead, Horatio, full of honor, duty and incredible valor.  No guessing about the hero being a good, honest man here, and heaven knows, we need a few more honorable hero's like him in this disrespectful world we live in.  In these two movies, Horatio is faced with keeping to form within the strict British seamen's code of conduct for members of His Majesty's  Royal Service and his own conscience for the good of his fellow man.  A fine line is drawn as the ensuing court trial seeks to uncover whether Horatio and his fellow officers worked in the best interest of England or simply sought to advance their own personal ambitions. The heroics, compassion, comradery, and sacrifice that follow are testaments to what men can become.  If you like programs that uphold what is good and honorable among men, then you will love this series.  No flawed anti hero here who breaks every rule along the way, just good old fashioned high seas adventure with a hero who has a heart of gold.",988416000,4,1164,4.648780487804878
1419804,5,B00005B1VL,"I am not a ""maritime buff"" nor am I a fan of C.S. Forrester's works but I thoroughly enjoyed the A&E/BBC ""Horatio Hornblower"" series.  I have to admit that I was first drawn to the series because of Ioan Gruffudd (whom I admired in ""Great Expectations"" and ""Titanic"") but soon found myself hooked because of the gripping storylines, great action and impressive production values (set, costumes, casting, etc.).
In ""Mutiny,"" Hornblower and fellow officers are accused of mutiny against the increasingly unstable and sadistic Capt. Sawyer.  In ""Retribution,"" Hornblower must prove his innocence and an important battle against the Spanish puts his and his fellow shipmates lives in grave danger.
This follow-up series is just as impressive as the original (which came out in 1999).  It brings back characters such as Sir Edward Pellew (Robert Lindsey), Lt. Kennedy (Jamie Bamber), Mathews (Paul Copley) and Styles (Sean Gilder). This series also introduces us to some memorable characters (and great actors) such as Lt. Bush (Paul McGann of ""Our Mutual Friend""), Dr. Clive (David Rintoul who played Mr. Darcy in the 1985 ""Pride and Prejudice""), Capt. Sawyer (wonderfully portrayed by David Warner of ""Titanic"") and Midshipman Wellard (newcomer Terence Corrigan).
As always, Ioan Gruffudd is in excellent form and I hope A&E/BBC will continue to bring us more of  ""Horatio Hornblower!""",988416000,19,1382,5.296803652968037
1419805,5,B00005B1VL,"The cast, producers, directors, etc. did and outstanding job in the latest two episodes, Mutiny and Retribution!  I heartily echo the sentiments made by Hornblower fans in previous reviews.
It is so refreshing to see a wonderful story, with outstanding acting, direction, etc. without relying too heavily on complicated special effects.  With that said, I would like to state that the sequences with the model ships were outstanding yet again!
Because I have so enjoyed the Hornblower series on DVD, I have eagerly read all the Hornblower reviews by you long-time Hornblower fans.
Being a fairly new fan of just one year, I have recently learned here on this site, that CS Forrester had written a series of 11 books about Hornblower's career.  I have purchased and read Mr. Midshipman Hornblower.  What an excellent book! Looking forward to reading the remaining 10 books and hope more televison movies will be made!",988329600,14,916,5.046357615894039
1419806,5,B00005B1VL,"The adventure continues with two movies -- ""Mutiny"" and ""Retribution.""  In ""Mutiny"", 3rd Lt. Hornblower is in jail and being visited by Commodore Pellew (his former captain).  Hornblower is accused of mutiny!  The remainder of the movie takes place in the past with Horatio, 4th Lt. Kennedy, Styles, and Matthews now on board the HMS Renown (a 78-gun warship, much larger than his previous ship).  Through the course of the episode, it becomes apparent that the ship's captain is losing his mental abilities causing the senior officers much concern.  By the end of the episode, a very reluctant ship's doctor is forced to declare the captain unfit for command while the Renown comes under heavy fire from a Spanish fort.
""Retribution"" starts with Commodore Pellew revealed to be one of three officers hearing the court martial proceedings.  The episode is a series of flashbacks as various characters are question by the board.  All of these flashbacks take place immediately after the incidents in ""Mutiny."" The senior officers of the Renown decided that if they are going to face a court martial anyway when the get back to port, they might as well do some good by taking the Spanish fort.  This they do thanks to Hornblower's cleverness.  But soon the English are forced to abandon the fort when they discover the Spanish have been under siege for months by an army of revolting slaves.  The episode gets deeper with 1st Lt. Buckland, now in command of Renown, showing that he's not a very good commander.  Hornblower has the respect of most of the men and Buckland becomes slightly jealous of this fact.  By the time the Renown gets back to port, Hornblower has even managed to win the respect of a low-level officer (midshipman?) named Hobbs who'd been fiercely loyal to Captain Sawyer and who'd hated Hornblower for his part in removing the captain from command.
Ultimately both of these movies are about loyalty -- loyalty to one's captain, loyalty to one's shipmates, loyalty to one's country, and finally the loyalty that the crew have/come to have for 3rd Lt. Hornblower.  Be warned, this is a tear-jerker!",987811200,66,2116,4.893557422969188

In it, Hornblower must make decisions for the good of his fellow shipmates and the ship, after the captain has been making bad choices and eventually goes mad.  He must show his brave and true duty in the face of danger and violence. He also must face a trial  for his actions, which could cost him his life. He never wavies in his decisions and is rewarded in the end with a promotion, which he doesn't feel he deserves.  This episiode shows Hornblower at his best and what a true leader he has become.

This two-movie set continues where the four-part A&E mini-series left off.  Hornblower, now the 3rd Lieutenant on a 76 gun ship-of-the-line is put to the test when his captain begins displaying eratic behavior and seeing plots afoot at every turn.  The first lieutenant is not up to command, the second lieutenant just shipped aboard and has no information to work with concerning the captain's behavior.  It's up to Horatio to hold the crew together and prevent disaster.  In the first movie, The Mutiny, Hornblower becomes involved with a mutiny on board His Majesty's ship while at the same time trying to carry out their mission of attacking a Spanish fort during the Napoleonic Wars.  In the second movie, Retribution, Hornblower is sent to court-martial facing a death sentence for his role in the mutiny.  Ioan Gruffudd and Robert Lindsey give their career's finest performances.  Since the movies were made for television, there is no motion picture rating.

1420005,5,B00005B1VL,"The Horatio Hornblower adventure continues indeed in this two DVD package that tells the long but fascinting story of Lt. Hornblower's struggles serving under Captain Sawyer, a once great hero who is now gradually losing his mind and has paranoid delusions. Thus the episode ""Mutiny"" and the episode ""Retribution"" tell one continuous story.

Captain Sawyer's dementia is soon spotted by all four of his leutenants. HOwever the first senior leutenant is an incompetent, indecisive, timid, careerist. This means that when control of the ship is assumed by the young officers, the new leader is just as problematic in his own way as was Captain Sawyer.

Underneath all the bravery and action is an important theme. This theme has to do with loyalty and the strength of loyalty. The old heroic Captain Sawyer has men who have fought for him for years and worship him. Thus, they are not inclined to recognize his growing dementia and are in fact familiar with his robust leadership style. They see the young bright leutenants as upstarts and mutineers. Thus the crisis in strong leadership leads to factions and divisions which weakens the entire enterprise. When Sawyer is replaced by an incompetent,the conflicts continue.

The first episode ""Mutiny"" is very engaging as you see the struggle between Hornblower and Sawyer. However the second episode ""Retribution"" has a terrific ending with the incredible loyalty of Lt. Archie Kennedy demonstrated for Lt. Hornblower.

It is the aspects of dominance, leadership, loyalty, judgement that lies behind these 2 episodes and these films explore these fascinating concepts very well. Of course we get all the daring do of Ioan Gruffudd playing the role of Horatio Hornblower somewhat as if he were an 18th century James Bond, but all the wild dramatics and action add to the underlying theme of loyalty that is the infrastructure of the entire plot.",1193184000,5,1892,5.11326860841424

1420008,4,B00005B1VL,"My original two-star review: As a Hornblower fan for many decades, I am very disappointed in this movie. Ioan Gruffud portrays a Hornblower who is almost a modern high school delinquent - the kind who walks in front of your car when you drive near a public HS to show he is ""cool"" or a ""big man"". Whereas this may appeal to someone who sports a ""Question Authority"" sticker, it is not the Hornblower I know. Overall, it seems that the movies did not do too well with one of the greatest heroes of fiction - but at least Gregory Peck's Hornblower was decent - this one is not quite the material from which a Commodore Hornblower is made... The kind of person portrayed by Gruffud is, above all, childish (as we all know, ""cool"" is the same as ""cute""). Perhaps the other ones with this Ioan Gruffud are better, but these two are bad enough that they keep me from buying the others.
My correction: My original review was wrong - as I started in the middle of the series. When you go through the whole series from beginning to end, you clearly see the evolution of character, and how he could become Commodore Hornblower.

In particular, First Lieutenant Buckland is nothing like the same character in the novel.  Archie Kennedy, a major character in the film, does not appear in the novel at all. I won't go into all of the many differences here, other than to say that they are substantial.

1420018,5,B00005B1VL,"Let me just say, my ""to read"" list is very long and Forester's Hornblower series is on there somewhere, quietly inching its way up. So, this review will be based solely on the merits of the movies.
Having seen the whole series, I may be inclined to say that *Retribution* is my favorite. And this is not because the plot is the best--in fact, the first set of movies were perhaps better in this regard. But there was a strength in this set, especially the latter, that drew me in.
That strength came in the form of the characters themselves. To say that this was because of fine acting would be redundant as so many of the other reviewers have pointed this out. Yet what I've seen mentioned so little is the presence of strong emotion. One would think that that fine naval code, the strict sense of rank, would leave scarce room for feeling. So why is it that when Pellew lets slip how much he cares for Hornblower I found myself in that vague state of misty smiles? The bond between the men, all of the men, is at its most touching here. And I found myself reacting more to that than anything else in the series(even though the action was stirring and the sense of suspense sweet.)
I was thoroughly pleased with the series as a whole and *The Adventure Continues* offered even more entertainment. Ioan Gruffudd is wonderful as Hornblower, though Gregory Peck he is not, and I truly hope to see more of him both as Hornblower and not.",1024617600,4,1434,4.4356060606060606

1420023,5,B00005B1VL,"Those already familiar with A&E's Hornblower series, which this set continues, know that it deals with the early days of a Nelsonian hero, drawn from the novels of C.S. Forester.  Reading the series is best done young, before tackling the wonderfully more literary but still derivative works of Patrick O'Brien.  (Alexander Kent, Dudley Pope, and Richard Woodman are also quite worthwhile.)  And the Forester series, like all of its offspring, is best savored whole rather than piecemeal.  One comes to care not only about the central figure but also about all of the others who surround him in successive books.  This characteristic is well captured by the ensemble cast of the A&E series.  In fact, their promotions through merit can be quite satisfying to the reader of the books.  One should be warned, however, that the A&E series represents only the early days of Hornblower thus far, and thus the most compelling adventures, to my mind at least, are still ahead.  By this I mean the episodes in which Hornblower commands his own ship, which should be of increasing size as the series progresses.  ""The Adventure Continues"" contains two chapters of a unified story.  Unlike the preceding four chapters, which were episodic and could be easily viewed independently of one another, this set requires one to watch them in order.  The story is wonderful, and amply described elsewhere.  We are already devoted to the principal characters such as Ioan Gruffudd, or we wouldn't be watching, would we?  So I would like to single out the performance of David Warner as the once-great captain who has declined into madness, and who must be declared unfit in order for the ""Renown"" and its crew to survive.  Warner occupies this critically central role superbly, and makes all else believable.  Also notable to naval enthusiasts is that the ""Renown"" is a ship of the line, not a smaller frigate.  There are more people in the battle scenes, and the great power of this class of ship can be sensed even at this remove.  In sum, there cannot be any readers of the aforementioned series of novels of Napoleonic naval war who will not love the A&E series, and for those who come to it without prior interest in the subject but find themselves captured by the gripping stories
and fine acting, I can only say that I envy the pleasures that lie ahead in the many books that they now have before them.",1003190400,9,2390,4.80440097799511
1420024,5,B00005B1VL,"The folks at Meridian and A&E have done it again--aided and abetted by a stellar cast led by the incomparable Ioan Gruffudd as Hornblower.
This time around, the waters are murkier, the villain(s)more multi-dimensional, the choices harder as Horatio walks a fine line between strictly following the rules and saving his ship from certain catastrophe.
How do you deal with an unstable captain, an incompetent 1st lieutenant and a mission that's ""heading for disaster?""
As usual, Horatio's intelligence, pluck and willingness to TAKE RESPONSIBILITY (unlike some characters I could mention) save the day, but not without mistakes on his part--and not without a price.
The supporting cast is brilliant: standout performances are given by Nicholas Jones, who embodies Buckland's dichotomy of well-meaning incompetence and self-serving vindictiveness and Phillip Glenister, whose Hobbs makes the transition from Sawyer's apologist to a man who is able to recognize and appreciate in Hornblower all the leadership qualities that Sawyer himself once possessed.
David Warner as Sawyer is a horrific, yet sympathetic Sawyer, and despite his cruel actions of the present, gives us fleeting glimpses of the great captain he once was.
The center of the piece is still Horatio, and Gruffudd plays him with just the right mixture of subtlety and elan.  The sequence in ""Mutiny"" when Sawyer discovers Horatio sleeping on watch is exquisitely played by Gruffudd.  We see--in a space of seconds-- Horatio's shock, near-panic, despair, fear, loathing, and bewilderment just from Gruffudd's reation shots alone.
Two nitpicks:
First, my wish is that the actual filming could have taken place at sea instead of on a stationary set, but that is a minor (MINOR!) quibble, and after reading interviews with the producer and director, I'm well aware of the logistics that prevented it.
Still, for the next installment in the series (I am very hopeful there will be one.  ITV, what say you?), the cast and crew will surely ""go back to sea"" as the Hotspur is a much smaller vessel than either the Renown or even Indefatigable.
Second, I hope the next movie in the series has a tighter focus around Horatio, as the first four movies did. Having read the books, I realize that ""Lieutenant Hornblower"", upon which this series of movies is based, is told from another character's point of view and that the book itself gives vital backstory that sets up subsequent events in Hornblower's life.  Still, I don't think the producers should underestimate the appeal of Gruffudd's Hornblower--it's his delving into the complex character of Horatio that made so many of us fans to begin with.
Anyway, I'm anxious for the next installment. I'm looking forward to seeing HH down and out in Portsmouth, marrying ""the wrong woman"" and cementing his friendship/working relationship with Bush.  And for the action-minded, there's plenty of swash and buckle to be mined in the ""Hotspur"" story.

Some of the episodes are almost unrecognizable. I did enjoy the series for what it was. The opportunities to see a movie about life at sea in the Royal Navy are few and far between. I understand the need to make the stories more attractive to a larger audience but they went too far in my view. Hornblower was a loner not a ladies man. He had only three romantic liaisons in his entire life if memory serves. He has some sort of interaction with a female in almost every episode it seems. He is not friends with the crew - that would be unthinkable - the writers did not seem to understand the hierarchy of the Royal Navy. There were so many historical and technical errors - they could have least made an effort to get it right. The character of Archie Kennedy was expanded out of all proportion - Hornblower's friend. In the books Hornblower didn't make any close friends in his entire life. He became close to Bush but there was still the difference of rank as a barrier. If you have never seen anything on screen in this genre, it will be a thrill to watch. If you have read the books (and a purist like me) you will try to forget what you have read in order to enjoy the films.",994118400,7,1352,4.244186046511628

While all the characters were well cast, the plotline isn't as spry and doesn't move with the same quick tempo.  A&E might have picked a better story from the treasure trove of C.S. Forester's series.
Furthermore, there is little to suggest that our hero Horatio has developed as a character since we last saw him on the quarterdeck with Captain Pellew.  And speaking of Pellew, A&E's scant use of him (portrayed brilliantly by Robert Lindsay) is woeful.
Then again, any Hornblower installment these days is a breath of fresh air in the television void -- so enjoy it for what it is.

1420027,4,B00005B1VL,"This second set of films adapting the adventures of a younger Horatio Hornblower has its strengths and weaknesses.  It's strengths comes from strong performances, particularly from David Warner (Captian Sawyer) and Phil Glensler (Hobbs).  The screenplay expands and fleshes out both of these men who were minor character in the book (Lieutenant Hornblower).  Hornblower seem to take Bush's role as the defender of the Captian while Archie (Who doesn't appear in the book)provides a stark contrast.  The promotion of both Styles and Matthews and their interaction makes for more interesting action and character development.  In fact the only characters the don't seem to develop are the heros of the actual book (Hornblower and Bush) Neither seem to be played to their fullest but I see more a problem in the writing then the acting.  In fairness I think Warner and Glensler steal the show.  Buckland is painted as totally incompatent which just doen't jibe with the way things worked in the RN.  In addition the gratuious inclusion of Pellew and two sappy scenes concerning Welland and Sawyer and the Buckland and Hornblower doesn't do the series credit.  Granted the movie doesn't end in the same spot as the book but I felt a bit cheeted.  Of coure as a rule the movie is never better than the book and the book is first rate.

The captain, however, is slipping into madness, fearing that his officers are planning to mutiny, and undertaking rash actions that could start to threaten the safety of the ship and everyone aboard. The first film, ""Mutiny"" details Hornblower and the other officers ordeal as they are faced with the difficult and increasingly inevitable choice to relieve Sawyer of command. The second film, ""Retribution"", has the officers on trail for their decison, with the rest of the action told in flashbacks. Based on events in the novel ""Lieutenant Hornblower"", by C.S. Forrester, these two movies make for a very satisfying experience.
Reuniting most of the cast from the first four films (based on Forrester's ""Mr. Midshipman Hornblower"" - not requiered viewing to enjoy these two, but HIGHLY reccomended!). Ioan Gruffud is still perfectly cast as Hornblower, and Robert Lidsay is still fantastic as Commodore Pellew. David Warner, however, steals every scene with his textured portrayal of Captain Sawyer, a once-great hero who feels his sanity slipping away from him. He manages to evoke some sympathy despite his cruel actions. And speaking of action, these films feature ship battles, sword fights, and a seige on a Spainsh fort, all done in spectacular cinematic fashion. These films are a must-see for fans of swashbucklers, and devotees of Forrester's novels (or those of Patrick O'Brien, Alexander Kent, etc.).
