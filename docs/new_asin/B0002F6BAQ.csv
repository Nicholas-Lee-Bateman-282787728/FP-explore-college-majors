8027534,1,B0002F6BAQ,"You would think with a title of a movie being ""Expecting Mercy"", it would be some action packed thriller. This is sooooo not. A young couple, on the run from the law, somehow find an isolated bed and breakfast. It's owned by a perverted older guy and his wife who is clearly fed up with him. He has set up cameras everywhere, and sells amateur pornographic movies. Its not action packed at all, and is really not worth purchasing. It's like you're waiting throughout the movie for something big to happen and it never does.",1352851200,,523,4.515789473684211
8027535,2,B0002F6BAQ,"EXPECTING MERCY is one of those movies whose message is ""It's allright to murder somebody if they are sleazy rapists.""  Given that premise, this movie isn't a real turkey; it's an obvious low budget film with an interesting performance from Carrie Hitchcock.  She plays the wife of a sex-crazy innkeeper who videotapes his guests having sex.  Brian Mani plays Ed, the husband who has set his sights on his latest guest:  a young woman who has supposedly eloped with her boyfriend.  We know however that this couple is really on the run from the law as they have stolen some money from their employer who just happened to rape the young girl.  Heather Prate is the girl and Jim Wagner the macho Kurt.  They do well in underdeveloped roles, but it's Hitchcock who brings the most weight to this basically four character melodrama.  An unusual ending helps but overall the movie is merely a psychosexual mishmash.",1135036800,2,910,4.788461538461538
