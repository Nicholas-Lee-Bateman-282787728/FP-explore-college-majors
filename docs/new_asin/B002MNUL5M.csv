8373962,4,B002MNUL5M,We love Veggietales! This one we had watched a couple times before our 2 year old tried to get it out of the case on his own which caused the disc to break.  And so we ordered a copy from amazon.  I was a little disappointed on the shipping speed (free 2 day) as I thought when I ordered it early on Friday it would have been delivered on Monday but didn't come until Tuesday.  But we still love this story of Saint Nicholas and Amazon!,1377388800,,436,4.046511627906977

8373964,5,B002MNUL5M,"This is a great and captivating story of the origin of Santa Claus. In true Veggie Tales form, it's high quality music, story telling, and humor to educate children (and adults) on the original St. Nicholas. We've used it each year as a way of helping teach our children about the true meaning of Christmas.",1291939200,2,307,4.6
