8509543,1,B0073XYBTS,"Sexy Playgirls(1974) is DULL! I adore Li Ching, but this is one of her worst movies. The only scene that's a turn on is when a woman is topless while buttoning a shirt. The rest of the movie is sleazy and icky. Lu Chi also directed 1973''s Sexy Girls of Denmark, a gimmicky comedy-drama filled with nude females. This movie was restored and released only on VCD in Hong Kong. We do NOT see Li Ching nude in this film. The scene where people dance to the Hawaii 5 O theme song was funny. It's like dancing to the Laverne & Shirley theme song. In Sexy Playgirls, Li Ching played a woman who sleeps with her boss for money and loses her sanity! She also falls in love with a singer played by Tsung Hua. Li Ching looked sexier in Susanna(1968) and Hong Kong Rhapsody(1968). The late 1970's was the beginning of the end of her movie career. Only brave souls should watch this 1970's turkey.",1520640000,,885,4.337349397590361
