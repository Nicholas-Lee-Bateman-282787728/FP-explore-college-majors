8078489,5,B000AGTQ4A,"Not exactly 'Criterion' quality, but surprisingly decent quality for four films (over five and a half hours!) compressed onto one single disc! Probably of the lowest quality 'King Lear' in what appears to be a British television broadcast. Though I haven't watched that one yet, I did preview about a minute or so, and Orson Welles was captivating right off the bat!
But my personal favourite, a charming and fascinating movie I would have once easily paid $20 alone for (and in the exact condition it is here) is 'The Private Life of Henry the VIII' staring the charismatic, and great actor, Charles Laughton!
Along with 'King Lear', I have yet to watch 'The Rise of Catherine the Great' or 'Oliver Twist', also on this disc. Again, I watched a minute or two of each one just to check the quality, and though not stellar, they are definitely pretty good and most importantly, quite 'watchable'!
The beginning of each movie starts out with a little 'Platinum' logo in the lower right corner, but that disappears after a minute or two. Luckily, the opening credits of my favourite movie 'The Private Life of King Henry the VIII' are long enough that the logo disappears by the time the movie actually starts!
I also bought this for 'Oliver Twist' but am not entirely sure this is the old 'Oliver Twist' movie I enjoyed so much. I know that the version I liked the most came from the '30s or '40s, so this could be the one. Again, I haven't watched it yet.
Finally, for very old films in pretty good quality, $3 or $4 dollars for this DVD is superb!",1411430400,,1547,4.568345323741007
8078490,5,B000AGTQ4A,"This DVD contains 3 full length black and white feature films and an original TV presentation of King Lear, starring Orson Welles, from televisions Golden Age. The films include Oliver Twist with Dickie Moore, Rise Of Catherine The Great starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and The Private Life of Henry VIII with Charles Laughton. Although these titles are in the public domain, these motion pictures are somewhat rare and not that easy to find on other labels. Echo Bridge has used excellent source materials to produce this DVD. These old movies do show obvious signs of age and wear but their images are clear and sharp for the most part. This is a one sided DVD disc with four features on it. The company's logo appears at the bottom of the screen every so often. Great entertainment deal for the money.",1395014400,4,804,4.75
