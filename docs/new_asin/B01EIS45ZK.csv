The case is not well made, however, that is not a big issue as he enjoys this collection so much.  We are going to put the disc's into separate DVD cases because of the inside of the original case falls out and is breaking.  Would recommend, especially if you love the British Mysteries.

7735716,5,B01EIS45ZK,"Do you watch the ""Murdoch Mysteries"" all at once or do you dole them out to keep the enjoyment going? That's the problem for the viewer. Murdoch's world in Season 5 is still in the 1890s, but eventually Queen Victoria dies and King Edward takes over. Murdoch is played by Yannick Bisson and Station House 4 in Toronto has his assistant Constable Crabtree; his boss, Inspector Brackenreid; his love interest, Dr. Ogden; and others.

7735749,5,B01EIS45ZK,"Murdoch Mysteries is a treasure!  I discovered the show while channel surfing and excitedly shared my discovery with friends.  When we found out that the show had been broadcast in Canada for a number of years, we wanted to find out if back seasons were available.  To our pleasure, several seasons were available to purchase online. So, we ordered as many seasons from Amazon we could get.  We set aside hot, summer afternoons to watch the intriguing and intertwining murder mysteries that Murdoch solved.  The acting, period costumes, story lines, scenes, settings, and program composition all add up to wonderful viewing. The actors portray characters that often rely upon early advances in science and/or historical events to help them solve the mysteries.  I highly recommend this show and am not surprised that it is one of the best from Canada for eleven seasons.  Here's hoping for many more years of delightful entertainment!",1500681600,,934,5.105263157894737

7735878,5,B01EIS45ZK,"I raced through the 62 episodes in this collection in a couple of weeks. Like the Collection 1-4, there are many great episodes. I like the ones that involve real persons and characters from classic fiction, like Sherlock Holmes. Original characters like James Pendrick recur, as do several serial characters, who make good foils for Murdock. The stories happen over the background of real historical events, which are mentioned from time to time and sometimes become the focus of an episode. The Boer War is featured. As an historian, I appreciate the writing and the costuming. I'm not an expert on every detail, but everything is pretty authentic, including many of the expressions people use and the fads that are introduced - ragtime music, hot dogs, banana splits, chicken wings with sauce. The use of irony is great too - Edison saying in one episode that moving pictures with sound would never catch on, Murdoch telling Crabtree his investments in companies like General Electric would never bring him a return, and so on. This was a great buy, and some $30 Canadian less than amazon.ca even with shipping and exchange. Highly recommended!",1482451200,2,1147,4.979166666666667

7735897,5,B01EIS45ZK,"My family has become great fans of the Murdoch Mysteries and we have progressively purchased and watched season after season. The mysteries take place in Canada at the end of the 1800's and involve invention and technology to solve the crimes. You follow the effect of electricity, motion pictures, horseless carriage, powered bicycle, transmission of messages through the air, development of the telephone, finger printing and much more, creating a fascinating perspective of the turn of the century. The four central figures of Murdoch the detective, Julia the woman's rights advocate and Murdoch's soul mate, George the constable, and the Inspector of Station No. 4 are memorable and well characterized. The murder is usually at the beginning within the first few minutes. There are many scenes of autopsies as the evidence uncovered during them is often critical in solving the crime. Placing Julia as the coroner and later replacing her with her female assistant emphasizes the changing role of women in society, as well as softening the shock of seeing the incised bodies being examined. An interesting feature is the reappearance of characters from an episode often widely separated from the present one. It is fun to see if you can remember and recognize these miscreants and identify the episode in which they first appeared. While sometimes seemingly formula based and sometimes fantastic, this is a thoroughly enjoyable series!",1479772800,,1438,5.283842794759825

7735924,5,B01EIS45ZK,"Still a unique and entertaining series. My only complaint is that the collection didn't include the final season 9, which would have made it more cost effective. Now I have to pay another $33 just to see the conclusion!",1476144000,,219,4.641025641025641

7735926,4,B01EIS45ZK,"These are light hearted -  a cross between a soap opera, slapstick comedy and very simple mysteries.",1474243200,,100,4.882352941176471
7735927,5,B01EIS45ZK,"Well, a decent series without the full stupidity of what is present in most.  Sometimes you need a science/history background to get all the subtle humor.  Never boring.  Minimal sexuality.  A good demonstration of how logic and science work.",1473811200,,242,5.128205128205129

8758783,5,B01EIS45ZK,"I haven't been this happy with a TV series since Downton Abbey concluded.  The characters are well developed and so believable.  I love how real historical events and people are woven into the story lines, mingling with  the personal lives of the four main characters.  The CSI element makes for great intelligent viewing as it relates to science today. I've noticed that the drama has become more edgey over the years, but not the least bit dreary or ghoulish, like some series.  I would watch it for the costumes alone.  I've watched all 11 seasons and the 2 Christmas specials.  I am eagerly awaiting the release of season 12.",1534896000,,629,4.715596330275229
8758784,5,B01EIS45ZK,"I love the Murdoch Mysteries, they are just great shows; I usually watch them while I'm walking on my treadmill. I got season 5-8, 1st because the 4 together were a good deal & 2nd I want the whole series eventually. I am still working on Season 4 with my walking; but I know 5-8 will be just as great!",1534032000,,302,4.05
