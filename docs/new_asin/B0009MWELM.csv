2301826,1,B0009MWELM,"I tried to watch this dvd, but after about 10 minutes gave up.  It was impossible to watch because only bits of the conversations between the characters were translated.  I've seen some poorly subtitled foreign films, but this was by far the worst.  Don't bother until a dvd with decent subtitles is released.",1126310400,2,309,4.7924528301886795
2301827,2,B0009MWELM,"For me, my low rating of this film might be, at least in part, the result of having wrong expectations about it.

I had heard this film described as 'charming' and 'funny,' and was expected a comedy, albeit a somewhat black one. But despite the good acting, this film left a sour taste in my mouth.

It is a dismal and agonizingly dreary film about people you never come to care about. I am an avid foreign language film buff, but I could not see the merit in this crude, hate-ridden and depressing story.",1125187200,2,505,4.361702127659575
2301828,4,B0009MWELM,"Jan Hrebejk is quickly turning into the best post-New Wave Czech director.  Unfortunately, my favorite movie of his ""Pelisky"" (Cozy Dens) is not available in the States, but you can get Divided We Fall.

I should preface this review by saying that the last century has been very 'up and down' for the Czechs.  After gaining independence from Austria-Hungary after WWI, they lost it twenty years later when Hitler invaded.  After the Nazis, there was a communist takeover, followed by a gradual political liberalization until 1968, when the Eastern Bloc armies invaded and instituted a crackdown on reform.  Twenty-one years later, the Czechs had a bloodless revolution and instituted a democratic republic.

Why the history lesson?  Well, at several different points during the 20th century, their entire culture was endangered, whether by Nazis or the USSR.  So you'd think that once the Czechs joined the European Union, they'd be in the clear, right?

Wrong.  EU membership brings its own problems, not the least of which is the flow of refugees and immigrants from poorer countries into the Czech Republic.  Czech culture now faces the threat of globalization, of a multicultural/multi-ethnic society that's no different from any other.

This may be lost to a casual viewer with little knowledge of Czech history.  During the many occupations of the country during the 20th century, there was mass EMIgration, as people fled first the Nazis, then the Communists 20+ years later.  Mass immigration represents an entirely new development for the Czechs, a new historical trauma with which they must come to grips.

Of course, the issue of whether or not globalization is something ANY of us can resist is another matter entirely, but I'm not trying to editorialize here, just provide some context for understanding the film.

The film opens with a truckload of Indians being smuggled into the country. Needless to say, there are some who resent the intrusion of foreigners into their culture--namely, racist soccer hooligans, as well as a pair of thieves who nevertheless disguise themselves as members of the races they despise in order to pick pockets at the Prague airport.

Emilia Vasaryova's character resents the intrusion of foreigners, but has no qualms about buying low-priced shoes at the Vietnamese market.  In other words, she doesn't mind getting a bargain (on labor, products, etc.) from immigrants, but she doesn't want to LIVE near them.  Such is the tortured logic of racism, I suppose, and in this character many Americans (if they're honest with themselves) might recognize their Czech doppelganger.  This particular character embodies the logic of Dan Barta's song ""Hello, America"", which plays during the opening credits.

Up and Down loosely weaves together multiple storylines involving, among others, one aforementioned soccer hooligan with racist friends and a mentally unstable wife, an emigrant to Australia whose ex-girlfriend is now with his father (and with whom she has had a child!), idiotic thieves, a Burmese martial-arts master, and so on.

The film remains ambivalent toward most of the characters, but never fully condemns any of them, showing their rationale for making potentially destructive decisions.  Although UP AND DOWN is a comedy (and contrary to other reviewers, I thought the film was hilarious), it also deals fairly honestly with the question of globalization, immigration, and racism without too heavy a hand.  I can only imagine how badly this movie would have turned out in the hands of an American director!

I saw this film two days ago and some of the characters are still in my thoughts, for better or for worse.  It's rare nowadays when a movie gives you a cast of characters that touch you on some level.  Highly recommended.",1121904000,23,3787,5.165573770491803
8063370,5,B0009MWELM,I loved the complexity of the plot and showing life in all of its unexpectedness and quirkiness.,1525564800,,96,4.705882352941177
8063371,4,B0009MWELM,"I liked it, tragic but ends well, subplots all tie together.  We all need someone!",1507680000,,82,4.466666666666667
8063372,4,B0009MWELM,"Very well done, a lot of funny bits, and had never seen that love triangle before, so much so it took awhile to figure out -- but ultimately a very sad movie (SPOILER), he back to his racist football pals, she back to stealing a baby. He really tried and was so close to moving beyond, but forces beyond his control wouldn't allow it.",1480550400,,334,4.234375
8063373,5,B0009MWELM,"This film is way underrated here.  It's really very nicely done, with a sharp script and spot-on acting, soundtrack (and sound in general), decoration (especially loved the moving doll collection!), editing--everything works.  I can see why some don't like it, having expected something else, but those looking for a subtle, intelligent but not intellectualized comedy/drama won't be disappointed.  The comedy is more of manners than slapstick, with lots of delicious, delightful touches, some absurdist, most very real.

The film takes up a number of story threads and brings them all together in a satisfying if only partly happy way, not too hard to follow.  The unifying theme of immigration/emigration/race is handled from many angles, with apt twists and ironies.  The characters, from a spectrum of social heights, are well drawn and played.  We're made to care about most of them, even if some of their pretenses or weaknesses are poked at in funny ways at times.  We feel both their triumphs and tragedies.

Emlia Vsryov, as a spurned wife, is especially good here, bringing a perfect balance and nuance to a complex role that could easily have made her unsympathetic.  Her dialogue is also exceptionally well honed.

The 18-minute making-of piece has the usual behind-the-scenes stuff, moderately entertaining and informative.

There's a cameo in the film by Vaclev Havel, by the way, not played up; it's just there in the logical place for it.",1261958400,6,1454,5.166666666666667
8063374,1,B0009MWELM,"This movie was another example of a really weird modern Czech movie. They often seem to think this way of American and British pop culture and we really don't want to see the details of their weird soccer club people. This movie sucks!! I wish that we could get more of their movies from the eighties like ""Slnce, Seno a Jahody"" (Sun, Hay and Strawberries) subtitled in English.",1227052800,,378,4.573529411764706
8063375,5,B0009MWELM,"This is a show that has a serious plot but is really funny throughout the whole film.  Classic Czech personality---life is serious and oppressive but there is still humor in the cracks and crevices of life.

LOVED IT!!",1177027200,2,218,4.7105263157894735
8063376,2,B0009MWELM,"The summary of this movie makes it sound like a light-hearted happy-go-lucky type of film.  Unfortunately, it is exactly the opposite.  Aside from the funny scene involving the Colonel, I didn't see much humor.  Mainly this movie revolves around the serious (not funny) topics of neglect, racism, and self-worth.  At first I thought that maybe I just wasn't getting the Czech type of humor, but by the end I was thoroughly depressed.  Maybe if my expectations had been different I could give this more than 2 stars.  If you like deep, thoughful movies, then this might suit you, but don't expect Sideways part 2.",1147305600,3,612,4.836538461538462
8063377,5,B0009MWELM,"The movie is similar to Crash.  It is a comedy/drama about the subject of immigration, emigration and racial mixing among modern day Czechs.  The performances are expertly acted and very moving.  I love the storyline of a skinhead footballer who tries to ""adopt"" a colored boy when his wife buys him and brings him home.  It seems when it comes to having a son, color doesn't really matter all that much, even to a committed Ayran!",1141430400,5,431,4.631578947368421
8063378,2,B0009MWELM,"This movie could have been much better if only the director examined his work with some self criticism, and cut out (and replaced) about 40-60 minutes of boring and deadly dragging footage; that is what the movie fell into after 10 minutes or so of the promising opening scene. I'd be curious to find out where the director dug out the cast (I recognized only aged Jan Triska, who's fame has been long gone), but the quality of acting was terrible for the most of the time. I'm definitely puzzled by the choice of several non-native Czech actors portraying the locals (maybe a deeper meaning in this plot touching the immigration issue?). Anyway, perhaps the script was bad too, so combined with poor acting the result was inevitable; the not-so-original scheme of portraying bunch of losers going through theirs ups and downs did not help either. This movie will probably be soon forgotten; the creators tried to come up with something very original, and in my opinion they failed all the way. I feel somewhat sad for the fact that this piece of work represents the Czech country abroad these days; my country. Why do we need to be reminded of problems which mass media beats into us on a daily bases and long-term issues obvious when you look around if you stick in the country for a longer then 2 week holiday? If this material was presented in the more professional manner, maybe the movie had a chance - but bad matter wrapped into the equally bad movie hurts twice - painful enough that I felt need to write this short review.

I'm not familiar with too many good Czech movies created during the last decade, I guess nobody sticks out of the crowd and has enough talent, experience and taste that would even remotely match exceptionally excellent Zdenek Sverak (my favorite Czech director). The director of ""Up and Down"" Jan Hrebejk has a lot to learn ahead, and I'll think twice before watching his next movie, even for free (my wife and I were silly enough to grab this on Pay-per-View for fee; I checked the mixed reviews here before the purchase and since I've seen split ratings, we gave it a try).",1129680000,,2109,4.624
8063379,1,B0009MWELM,"The promotional sonopsis states that this is an interesting, funny tale of unusual characters. What I got from it is to expect a Czech ""Snatch"" or something similar.  You know, funny.  Black comedy.  What I got was an extremely depressing tale about how much life sucked.  I could elaborate on the details of their examples as to why life sucks, but that can be found elswere.

If that is the sort of movie you are looking for then I'd give it 1 stars, but because I was misled by the promotional material, I give it zero stars.",1127952000,2,528,4.402061855670103
