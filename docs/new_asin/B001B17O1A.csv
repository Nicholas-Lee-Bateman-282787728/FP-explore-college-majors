8281045,5,B001B17O1A,"Pearry Teo is without a doubt one of THE most creative forces in cinema today.  He is the anti-Spielberg.  He doesn't need big money and has NO ego.

He can create a deeply disturbing or breath-takingly beautiful movie in less money than Spielberg spends on about 1 day of CGI - since there is almost NO acting and little or no plot in Spielberg movies.

Pearry Teo's movies are RAW, shot with little or NO money yet they FAR surpass anything Spielberg or Lucas have done in FX - Pearry does a lot of the FX and CGI himself.

But FX are secondary as his films offer far more in depth and breath of Plot, character and story.

Even the latest highly acclaimed full-length feature 'Gene Generation' has an amazing and deep story. All the  incredible cinematography and special FX are only a compliment to intense and deeply woven story he has created

'Liberata Me' WON the NY Independent Film Critics Award and went to Cannes before Mr. Teo ever entered Film school.

It's not likely anything from Pearry Teo will disappoint.",1232841600,2,1024,4.582417582417582
8281046,5,B001B17O1A,"I did the set design, amongst other things on both ""Liberata' Me"" and ""Children of the Arcana.""  It's a totally new kind of concept and is a ""Must Watch"" for those of you who are indie film fans.  If you're squeemish, though, I would avoid it.  I don't make any money off of this so I have no reason to promote it.",1213920000,2,314,4.032258064516129
