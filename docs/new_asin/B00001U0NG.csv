This TV series is my favourite at this moment and I really suggest you buying them, but make sure you get the completed 1st season.",1370822400,3,378,4.108108108108108
1246411,5,B00001U0NG,"I started watching a couple of the shows around 2:00 in the morning and got hooked.
The show was actually on reruns and by the time I got interested in the series it was cancelled.
I was disappointed when it wasn't renewed, because I never saw the complete season.
Unfortunately when the show was on television we were overseas and I never thought I would be able
to purchase any of the shows much less the series..
Imagine my suprise and delight to know I was able to purchase the entire series through Amazon.
I have bought a variety of items from Amazon and have always up to this point in time never been disappointed.",1354492800,5,622,4.417391304347826
1246412,5,B00001U0NG,I was so happy to find this dvd.  I cannot wait until the rest of the series comes out.  I absolutely loved this show when it came out and want to get the whole series.  I hope they put out the rest of the series soon.,1303257600,4,218,3.6956521739130435
1246413,5,B00001U0NG,This was a great movie and tv series. It show what our unsung heros do to protect our freedoms. The tv series only lasted a couple of years. Hopefully it will be out on dvd soon.,1239494400,9,178,3.9722222222222223
1246414,5,B00001U0NG,"This show had several elements that made it fun to watch. The friction between Margo and Benny Ray. Chance, an expert with edged weapons. CJ, battling alcoholism, while also handling explosives. The ""on and off"" romance between Matt and Margo. And, in the second season, the unpredictability of Deke. Not to mention the action! And then, there was Margo. Very sexy!

Unfortunately, we were left hanging at the end of season two. DANGIT!

Hopefully, both seasons of this show will come up for sale soon!",1211155200,4,502,4.894117647058824
1246415,4,B00001U0NG,"Loved the TV series - wouldn't mind getting all of them on disk.

This is better than nothing.",1152662400,11,94,4.222222222222222
1246416,3,B00001U0NG,"IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE SAME BRAD JOHNSON THAT PLAYED THE DEPUTY SHERIFF IN THE TV SERIES ""ANNIE OAKLEY"" WITH GAIL DAVIS....  UNBELIEVABLE!!!!",1152403200,,156,5.0
1246417,5,B00001U0NG,"This movie version of two episodes (Deja Vu and Apres Vu) from the tv show Soldier of Fortune Inc. was not a failed pilot for the series. The pilot episode was entitled ""Genesis"" and there were 20 awesome episodes, including ""Deja Vu"" and ""Apres Vu"". (The second season was a major disappointment. They changed the series name to Special Ops Force, canned two of the actors, replaced them with none other than Dennis Rodman (need I say more) and generally wrecked the show...) However, back to the DVD.

The show starred Brad Johnson, Tim Abell, Melinda Clarke, Real Andrews, and Mark Shepard as ex-military and CIA types, and David Selby as their ""boss"". They became ""Soldiers of Fortune"" and conducted various black ops missions around the globe. In these two episodes, they were sent on a mission to rescue someone who they believed had been kidnapped, but discover that their intel was ""flawed"" and the mission goes really really bad.  This is portrayed through two perspectives, first by Major Shephard's point of view (Brad Johnson) and by what really happened. If you watch carefully, it is not confusing, it is an interesting, creative way of presenting an action-packed story.

I really wish that Jerry Bruckheimer would release the whole season one series of Soldier of Fortune, Inc. on DVD. I would be first in line to buy it, it will always be one of my all time favorite tv shows! And by the way, Jerry Bruckheimer has had several successful tv shows since then, ever hear of CSI and Without A Trace?",1105920000,43,1513,4.767175572519084
1246418,4,B00001U0NG,"Enjoyed watching Brad Johnson star in a war hero movie! Looked everywhere to find movies he's been in. Finally, on amazon found this one! Great movie, good dialogue and acting. I hope to see him in more movies. A gotta see movie.",1104710400,4,229,4.476190476190476
1246419,3,B00001U0NG,"This was one of Jerry Bruckheimer, the movies' premier action scions, first t.v. ventures. A pilot for a failed series, SOLDIER OF FORTUNE INC. tries to use slow motion action sequences to further its plot.  While not a bad movie, it is derivative and offers little new for the genre.

Brad Johnson (Always) stars as the leader of a special ops group who is critically wounded in a botched Mexican raid.  The opening sequences are confusing, and redundant, done from each character's prospective fate.  The misleading technique doesn't do much but confuse the viewer as to what's really going on.  Johnson uses his macho presence to good effect and gets able support from Real Andrews and Tim Abell.  David Selby (Dark Shadows, Falcon Crest) is even on hand as the by the books commander.

Entertaining but not stimulating.  One can see why the pilot didn't sell and why Bruckheimer and company didn't do too much t.v. work afterwards.",1095897600,5,935,4.8734177215189876
7914805,1,B00001U0NG,"I thought I was buying the tv series.  I don't know what in the world this is.  It's not the series.  It's bits and pieces of something or other from it, but I'm really angry that it's not what it appears to be.

If you are looking for the series, this isn't it.",1521936000,,262,3.8867924528301887
7914806,5,B00001U0NG,I am glad you offered this movie.  I was a fan of the TV series.  The price is right and the movie is pretty good.  The condition is like new.  I really am pleased.,1485302400,,164,3.735294117647059
7914807,5,B00001U0NG,This show gets five stars. These two episodes on this disc aren't the best of the series. I wish that the entire series would become available for digital download. It was one of the best action series ever put on tv.,1473552000,,217,4.317073170731708
7914808,5,B00001U0NG,"This is not the late night series, but two back to back episodes. None the less, the episode is well chosen. I want to see all the episodes released, it was that good a show.",1468454400,,174,4.0
7914809,5,B00001U0NG,This was a great show and I just don't understand why the series has not been released on DVD or Blu-Ray.  These are great episodes but I want more.  Fortunately I still have a bunch of episodes on VHS but we all know those won't last forever.,1448668800,2,243,4.148936170212766
7914810,1,B00001U0NG,One or two episodes of a stellar first season is pretty stupid I have no idea why they did not include all of season one somebody just watching this has no idea what is going on who the characters are why we should care about them very poor don't purchase unless they release the whole first season season 2 was a waste of time and why it got cancelled so that one can be skipped,1443139200,,379,4.066666666666666

7914812,3,B00001U0NG,It was ok. Story line and plot were all over the place. Not what I remembered from the series. I liked the series back in the day. Maybe I've just grown out of the cheesy action flicks.,1415059200,,185,4.027027027027027
7914813,5,B00001U0NG,"I really enjoyed the DVD, because I had missed a lot of the cliff-hangers on tv in the mid-eighties.  Great service and prompt service.  Tha nk you",1381190400,,147,4.407407407407407
7914814,1,B00001U0NG,"Thought I was getting the entire series.  Instead I got the worst of the first season.  Love the idea, actors were pretty good but the SPECWAR/SPECOPS consultant didn't do his job.  Fake.  Look to Strike Back if you want to see as real as TV can do.",1373241600,,249,4.23404255319149
