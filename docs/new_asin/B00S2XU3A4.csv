Triceps,  shoulders, and abs get a workout during some of the exercises, though they aren't targeted specifically. We even work on our spine/lower back.
Then it finishes off with a really nice cooldown/stretch. Most workout videos don't do sufficient stretching at the end. This one holds each stretch for an adequate time. I also like that there's a break between each section to tell us what we're doing next so I can gauge which weights I want to use and prep myself.",1532304000,,610,4.922330097087379
8697209,1,B00S2XU3A4,"I saw an advertising video of this workout on YouTube and got all excited.  Then I got the DVD, and it's nothing like the video!  How can that be?  It's like they showed parts that misrepresented the whole.

Anyway, this is just the kind of workout I really hate.  Why?  You are working very hard by, for example, by holding a plank, BUT the results are minimal and certainly not what I want.  For me there is no benefit in this.  It's just difficult, that's all.  With no benefits.  Well, the whole workout is like that.

It's all chopped up in pieces, each piece ending, then on the screen comes an announcement of what you're doing next.  There is no continuity, no cohesion.

Worst of all, there is no music, just some background beat.

It starts off with a deep lunge stretch -- on a cold body.  Makes no sense to me.

There is zero emotional satisfaction here, besides no real workout benefits.  It's drudgery.

I've figured out how important emotional satisfaction is in a workout by doing Ellen Barrett workouts.  Those are truly beautiful.  You WANT to do them because you feel soooo good doing them and you feel sooooo good afterwards.  The music is always beautiful.  The setting is generally nice.  That's emotional satisfaction.  It's too bad Ellen does not do 1 hour workouts or really hard workouts with wights (just light weights), because that's what I'd be doing.

SO disappointed with this :-(",1499472000,2,1412,4.642276422764228
