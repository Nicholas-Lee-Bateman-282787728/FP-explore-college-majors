8667804,4,B00LS96V14,I was just blown away by the concept. It worked well.,1458518400,,53,3.909090909090909
8667805,1,B00LS96V14,This is a movie that I do not see how anyone could possibly like. Like all the reviews I've written someone will come and put this as unhelpful behind this. If you want one of the best Scarlett Johnsson movies buy Match Point a great movie,1439683200,,239,4.217391304347826
8667806,5,B00LS96V14,"Creepy and terrifying film! An even scarier book! If you want to get a glimpse inside the mind of a psychopath, I can't think of  a better film!",1431216000,,144,4.142857142857143
8667807,2,B00LS96V14,"This is not a horrible movie. It's dark, eerie and creepy and well acted and the concept and story is interesting. Don't buy this, rent it. In my opinion it's not worth seeing more than once or not at all. I was excited to view this one and it just wasn't worth it.",1431129600,,265,4.018867924528302
8667808,5,B00LS96V14,Under The Skin is a film that allows the viewer too think for themselves. Rarely does a film do that. It's not just Scarlett Johansson naked. F'nd idiots!,1429488000,,154,4.535714285714286
8667809,1,B00LS96V14,I'm a Scarlett fan but this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen.  Dreadful and disappointing.,1427068800,,98,4.444444444444445
8667810,3,B00LS96V14,"The basic storyline is an alien female drives a van through Scotland seducing men.

The film opening has a faint muffled voice. It is the alien being learning to speak. What appears to be an alien comes to Scotland and tricks men into coming into her world where they can't walk on water. I wasn't sure if this was real science fiction or something like that Jake Gyllenhaal thing and this was just another metaphor for human relations...which it still could have been. The film changes direction about midway.

Scarlett plays an almost robotic alien, very slow and deliberate in her moves. She doesn't know how to respond to many situations. She asks for directions as if she was reading from a foreign phrase manual. As far as Sci-Fi goes in this genre I think ""Phantasm"" was more entertaining and ""Liquid Sky"" more clever.

Her acting was well done, but as far as entertaining, if left something to be desired. Clearly this is not a film for everyone.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb, sex, attempted rape, full frontal nudity Scarlett Johansson and a bunch of guys get naked in this film. If that is what you want to see, this has got it.",1419465600,3,1136,4.63681592039801
8667811,2,B00LS96V14,"Murky, pointless, confusing.  At least there was some nudity.",1416528000,,61,5.777777777777778
