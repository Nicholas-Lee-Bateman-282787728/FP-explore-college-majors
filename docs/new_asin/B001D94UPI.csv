8292367,5,B001D94UPI,"I love this DVD! I had no experience at all with printing on fabric (in fact, I'm a confirmed technophobe). But Lynn Koolish's calm, reassuring manner and clear step-by-step presentation made the techniques and processes instantly approachable and non-threatening.
She takes the viewer through the entire process at just the right pace. Instructions begin with very basic information about printers and inks, and progress all the way through how to electronically manipulate and enhance your own photos to create unique quilts and other projects. Koolish even shows how you can scan objects to use in making wonderful collage-style works of art. By the end, I felt that I could jump right in and begin having fun with the equipment and photos I already have on hand.
The accompanying Quick-Start PDF summarizes in handy form all the basics you need to know to get started.
I highly recommend this guide to anyone who wants to learn about this fascinating process.",1224374400,4,963,5.062893081761007
