8495118,5,B00695KOBA,"Gums is the funniest parody of Jaws I have ever seen.  I don't know were to begin because it's so zsny with Terry Hall, the beautiful mermaid to the crazy Brother Theodore, the craziest Nazi , the Robert Shaw role, who is fabulous.  This is a must see if you want to see the most creative and weird film.",1421366400,,304,4.135593220338983
8495119,2,B00695KOBA,"I made the mistake of purchasing this thinking that it would be the original version, i.e. the uncensored hard-core one. It is not; if that version exists out there on DVD, I'm not sure where it is.

Don't misunderstand: The hard-core stuff wouldn't make this a good movie. It simply would make it more bearable. It is totally intolerable in this form. As others here have pointed out, all of the hard-core time is censored with silly clip art that covers up what is happening.

Plot summary: A mermaid is threatening a local beach by killing men through forceable (though intensely pleasurable) oral sex. It's a send-up of ""Jaws"" which was huge in 1976 when this film was released.

This does have the distinction of being one of the top three to five most absurd movies that I've ever seen; again, not saying that that makes it good. It certainly doesn't. We have an outrageous number of phalluses in this movie, most of them fake. Two vaginas, one of them fake also. The one belonging to Terri Hall is seen quite a number of times and to be honest, that's the only thing that is keeping me from giving this one star. She at least is attractive.

To give you some idea of the level of ridiculousness of the film, two of the leading characters are switched out for hand puppets in the movie's final ""climactic"" (pun intended) scene.

It's obvious that outrageousness was the filmmaker's goal here, and to that end, mission accomplished. But the jokes don't work, aren't funny and are so sophomoric (and in some cases disgusting) that it taxes the viewer and required me to fast-forward just to get through much of it. Take the worst of Russ Meyer and put it with the worst of Bob Clark, and that about sums it up.",1388016000,,1714,4.5519480519480515

8495121,3,B00695KOBA,"No mention of censorship in the descriptions. Good color and audio. Should have the background making of, or a blooper reel.",1380758400,2,124,4.9523809523809526
8495122,2,B00695KOBA,"It may have once been made a porno, but this version isn't it.

It's got pictures coming up onto the screen to carry out the naughty bits. If you're after the X-Rated version this version is only going to frustrate you.",1376438400,,219,4.341463414634147
8495123,4,B00695KOBA,"Make no mistake, this is a horrible film.  It is a porn parody of 'Jaws' done in such a sloppy style, with such slap dash reckless abandon, that mere competence seems beyond the film maker's ability.  But it does follow - and mock - the original with genuine humor and it especially has two factors going for it; the beautiful Terri Hall and the amazing Brother Theodore.
Terri Hall was a porn actress - and this is a porn movie, barely 70 minutes long, with the brief naughty parts covered - who looked like she belonged on the side of a Grecian urn.  She was a great athlete and dancer (See 'Alice In Wonderland' for her dancing skills), so she has to do nearly all her work under the waves.  As a fan of classic porn movies, it is always a treat to see Terri.
Brother Theodore makes the film stand out and is single handedly responsible for the four star rating.  He was not a porn star (Thank God).  He was not really an actor, and I don't know if I can really even call him a comedian.  Brother Theodore was... unique, and he gets a rare chance to go over the top - way over the top, in fact - with hilarious results unlike I have ever seen in another movie.
Some of the other actors, such as Robert Kerman, also do a good job, and they do manage a boat and all the necessary scenes for the plot (barely). So you have a cheap, fast rip off of 'Jaws' made special by the talents of the incomparable Brother Theodore eating up the scenery.  Recommended if you like really strange offbeat films from the 1970s.",1372723200,3,1512,4.2439024390243905
8495124,3,B00695KOBA,"Gums(1976) was a well-made pornographic spoof of Jaws(1975). It was directed by Robert J. Kaplan and it had a budget of $1 million. It stars the late Brother Theodore(The 'Burbs) and the late Terri Hall. It also has a good music score by Brad Fiedel(The Terminator, True Lies). This DVD preserves the ""soft core version"" of Gums. All hard core scenes are censored by sight gags! Terri Hall played a mermaid who ""preys"" on people near the beaches! This film has some funny scenes. A dog in a house tells a guy to ""get lost"" in fluent English.

""This is 232! Take a hike! I am busy!""

A boat runs into the ""chicken of the sea"". It's just a sight gag with rubber chickens floating in the ocean! The mayor in the film wears a giant 1970's-ish tie. Brother Theodore hams it up as an ex-Nazi who is hired to hunt the mermaid. Brother Theodore played one of the Klopek's in the Tom Hanks film 'The Burbs(1989). Terri Hall does look sexy as a mermaid who seduces men. Gums was intentionally made as a campy spoof and it had no pretentions about being a serious film. Gums was made during the short-lived 1970's Porno Chic era. Deep Throat(1972) and Behind the Green Door(1973) were released around the same time.
Even this ""soft core"" version of Gums is very raunchy. This film is recommended only for adults. Gums is a ""forgotten gem"" from the 1970's.",1339200000,6,1344,4.504098360655738
