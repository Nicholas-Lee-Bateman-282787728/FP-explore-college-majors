7972935,1,B00006SFJF,"I rented this movie recently and it is just about the worst movie I have seen in a very, very long time. Whoever wrote and directed this are obviously totally unfamiliar with the subject matter, as the SEALs in the movie had absolutely no idea what they were doing. I guess they didn't have the budget for a technical advisor, because if they did, the actors would have known how to move and act properly (absolutely no clue as to how to carry or handle their weapons), they would have been outfitted properly (closed-circuit rebreathers, not cheap [stuff] from some diving gear rental place, for example), and would have had a clue about how to fight or use a knife.
The story was equally ridiculous, and the terrorists were equally unbelievable as they had no idea what they were doing either. The acting was almost too horrible to bear.
I could do better for under $100,000 using local talent and spending a good chunk of that to hire someone like Richard Marcinko, Harry Humphries or Chris Caracci as a technical advisor or maybe to do a cameo.
If you're looking for a decent movie featuring Navy SEALs that actually act like Navy SEALs, check out Tears of the Sun which Harry Humphries was the military advisor on, or The Rock which both Harry Humphries and Richard Marcinko were advisors on.",1062115200,3,1297,4.643478260869565
