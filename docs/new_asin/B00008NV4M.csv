1854800,5,B00008NV4M,"I've always been a fan of the real world and have enjoyed them all, but there was something about real world Las Vegas.  That was the best of them all.  I enjoyed that one the most because it's really the real world.  They really did a good job and I know they all learned a lot",1091318400,2,278,3.9285714285714284
1854801,5,B00008NV4M,"I love MTV's Real World. But the Las Vegas season has to be the best one yet. The high ratings back me up. You get everything in this season, the fights, the drama, the hook ups, the laughter, every type of emotion is experienced throughout this season. These season consisted of 7 very attractive people in sin city, so you know how it's gonna go down. It's very interesting to see how the cast grow and learn from the experiences that they have to face for the first time. You see the cast deal with all sorts of issues including racism, homophobia, pregnancy, family issues, relationships, health, alcoholism, etc. It's very interesting to watch the relationships of Alton and Itulan, as well as Steven and Trishelle. They both have there ups and downs, but will they end up together at the end? Will Frank ever find the girl of his dreams? Can Brynn make it the entire season without getting kicked out? Will Arissa ever make an effort to change so that she can not be as moody and hot tempered? Everyone on the season fought with someone during the show, but everyone really for the most part got along, and that's partly why we were all drawn to this particular cast. Not to mention all the girls are hot. The one thing i didn't like about the dvd is that the music isn't the same as when it aired, as well as it is censored, but i tend to overlook that. I still give this one 5 stars.
There is another dvd which is The Real World Las Vegas, ""You never saw.""
This is a great dvd only about an hour or so long but i found it hilarious. It's uncensored and shows some pretty sexy and funny scenes that didn't make the cut on the original broadcast. I would pick this up too if i were you.",1084492800,4,1692,4.307210031347962
1854802,4,B00008NV4M,"I like this season, not as much as the other seasons though. You know? Like all the other seasons have more drama, this one was more having ""party Party"" and wasn't as dramatizing as I wanted it to be. If they had Real World 10, or the Paris one, I would defenitely bye it.",1074384000,,273,4.074074074074074

1854804,5,B00008NV4M,"I loved this season, it was excellent.  It was great to see a cast with such fire, I love the fact that my african americans were representing on the show for the lovely divas, and handsome men. They just seemed to be the realist cast since the first Real World episode in New York. On a scale from 1 to 10 I give it an 11. It was excellent.

1854806,1,B00008NV4M,"realeasing this before the classics is absurd This group was the phoniest most unlikeable. Watching the Real World since the 1st season this is the first time i stopped watching because the cast was soooo overly dramatic, and looking constantly for attention, and forever complaining and arguing but at the end the usual ""We love each other so much"" lie.

1854808,2,B00008NV4M,"While I admire Bunim-Murray's releasing of an entire Real World season, why release Las Vegas right away?  With the first season on DVD, wouldn't it make more sense to release the classic seasons like Los Angeles and San Francisco first?  Plus, releasing Las Vegas right on the heels of its finale seems silly.  As if we aren't already sick of that gang to begin with!",1047600000,2,368,4.630769230769231

1854830,5,B00008NV4M,"This is where the show took a turn for the worse for a lot of real world fans but im still a fan of what came before and after.  Be aware there isn't a reunion on these DVDs though.  A few cast audition tapes is all you'll see in the extra department.  That's my only gripe with the set.
The season is a lot of fun and the cast all gets their time to shine for the most part.  You really get to know them all by the end of the season and hasn't that what the real world has always been about!",1439856000,3,492,3.7475728155339807

1854835,5,B00008NV4M,The Best season by far. The Las Vegas season was the best season. The entire cast was beautiful and interesting.,1385510400,,112,4.65

1854837,4,B00008NV4M,"Real World has always had charismatic, beautiful young people with strong personalities, and even though the times change, the young people really don't.  However, what I DO find interesting is that when the show first started out, the cast was not quite as sexual because they were aware of AIDS, which was still a relatively unknown disease until Pedro Zamora from the San Francisco show put a face onto it.  This is the first Real World I had watched since about 1999 (the show's free on Amazon Prime, so why not?), but it's surprising that you have two castmates who really don't know each other, having unprotected sex shortly after meeting.  A pregnancy scare is something we would've faced in the 1970s, not in the 2000s.  Overall, though, I can see why Trichelle was the break-out star in this cast -- she's beautiful, but also with a girl-next-door appeal.",1365465600,,865,4.785234899328859
1854838,2,B00008NV4M,Not much entertainment unless you want to see what Las Vegas is like. Thought the cast was a bit childish and foolish.,1365465600,,118,4.409090909090909
1854839,2,B00008NV4M,Situations within the episodes were contrived and impossible to actually occur in almost any situation. Did not like the program.,1361836800,,129,5.5
1854840,3,B00008NV4M,It was okay. Nothing special. Fine to watch if you're just sitting around bored. One of the better Real Worlds though.,1360886400,,118,4.666666666666667
1854841,5,B00008NV4M,"This is the first The Real World I've ever watched. I've never watched more than about two minutes of The Real World before I watched this season, so I don't know how it compares to other seasons. But, I really liked it, and it was really interesting, how it shows each person's personalities. I was amazed at how well this was put together.

Everybody in this show is beautiful, and Alton and Irulan end up hooking up, as do Steven and Tirshelle. There's a lot of alcohol, dance clubs, flirting and hooking up, and drama. I think there's just one person who doesn't have sex over the six months of the show. And as a technical note, they keep the same censoring (bleeps and blurring) that they had on the original MTV broadcast.

The people:
*Alton, a guy who's a romantic, but doesn't really know what he wants.
*Arissa, she has a tough life, with really mean relatives
*Brynn, initially a 'wild child,' who lets her anxiety get the best of her
*Frank, the smart thinker
*Irulan, she's someone who needs to be the center of attention, and does whatever it takes to put her back in the center of attention
*Steven, a wanna-be player with too much heart to be a true player
*Trishelle, a small town girl who's flirty and wants romance

Pros:
+Beautiful people
+Lots of drama, but not annoying drama
+Excellent casting
+Excellent filming, direction, editing, technical etc.

Cons:
-The season doesn't include a 'where are they now,' so it left me wondering what happened",1344816000,2,1469,4.66023166023166
1854842,4,B00008NV4M,"Actually BOSTON was the very best and I can't believe it's not available here. Other noteworthy seasons were HAWAII, SEATTLE, MIAMI, back to NEW YORK, PHILADELPHIA and maybe BROOKLYN.",1338595200,,183,5.344827586206897
1854843,5,B00008NV4M,"Enough said. This was the best The Real World MTV made. I actually watched the entire season of this one.

1854845,3,B00008NV4M,"3 1/2 stars

This one was worth 3 1/2, but not 4.  It was just shy of that.  I thought the editing was really good.  I thought it was interesting that every person on this show was totally bangin, and hot.  I like how a lot of the ""jobs"" or ""tasks"" in real Reality speak, was something designed to show off their HAWT bodies.  I also notice this being the first RW I ever saw where sex between the participants was encouraged (indirectly, condoms in the bathrooms, double and triple showers?) and so prevalent between multiple folks throughout the season.

I wouldn't be surprised if the personality tests weren't geared to bring together potential lovers in the screening process.  I saw a couple match ups that seemed quite natural.

I think this was a fine show, but I miss the ""grittiness"" of New York, or San Francisco.  Puck was one ugly dude, but he was damn interesting.  And Omarosa (I know she was on The Apprentice) wasn't exactly eye candy, if you know what I'm saying.

MC White said:  Pretty good.  Interesting and smokin' hot women!  Yowza!",1164844800,,1055,4.566844919786096
1854846,5,B00008NV4M,"That season was the best ever. Ha sido la mas que me ha gustado, he visto Real World desde Hawaii hasta la ultima Key West, pero Vegas ha sido la MEJORR!! Totalmente Recommended.",1160784000,2,178,4.424242424242424
1854847,5,B00008NV4M,"I must agree with everyone else - Vegas was the bomb!  MTV picked the perfect formula for this season:  7 attractive roommates, a killer location, and lots of alcohol = mad drama and sex!  This cast gets things shaking from the very first episode and it pretty much keeps on through the whole season.  The whole Steven & Trishelle ""relationship"" going back and forth, Alton and Irulan hooking up and all of the conflict that results, Brynn's jealousy about different things and her lashing out, Frank who was the nice guy who cut loose, and last but never least my girl Arissa who was the hotheaded sistergirl from Boston who always brought the drama.  The Real World is the starting point from which all of these new (terrible) ""reality"" shows have come and I always feel like they're completely contrived and phony but the Vegas season seemed to really give you a true look into these peoples' lives at that time.  The setting was great too - I've stayed at the Palms hotel and it is one of the coolest spots in Vegas for younger people.  The only negative thing I can say about this DVD is that MTV replaced the original music that they used when the show aired with the WORST, CORNIEST music I've ever heard  (see the part where Brynn auditions to be a go-go dancer - the music is ridiculous!).  Other than that you need to buy this DVD!",1100217600,12,1341,4.48559670781893
1854848,5,B00008NV4M,"I'll first start out by saying this.  I have religiously watched the Real World since it began.  Along with millions of other viewers.  It has been one of those captivating little shows that spark your curiousity.  But, Las Vegas by far has been my favorite season.  It also brought the ""metaphorical"" death to the real world.  Las Vegas had the most beautiful cast, the most sex, alcohol, fights, and for a first, there was no homosexual thrown in the mix.  (Not that I'm against any of the above listed things. LOL)  But, all of those things are the cause of its death.  It was just an explosion of this excess and hedonism and sense of ""fakeness"" that runied the real worlds that follow.  Paris-sucked, San Diego-sucked, Philladelphia-sucks at the moment.  I would have honestly been quite happy if the Real World would have just ended with Las Vegas.  It should have been the great ending. It is an awesome mix of many things.  Its over the top and I love it.  When you watch it, you will believe me. The DVD set is great.  And amazon.com is the best place that has the lowest price for it.  I really hope that the MTV producers get on the ball and start releasing the other seasons.  Enjoy this season.  For it is the true last Real World.",1096156800,14,1244,4.453333333333333
