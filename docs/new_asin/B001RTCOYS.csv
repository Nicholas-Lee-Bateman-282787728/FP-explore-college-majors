3778385,5,B001RTCOYS,"I attended this show and it was superb!  I also attended their carnival of sins concert at the same venue in 2005, Molson Amphitheatre.  I gotta say this DVD is going to rock!!!!  They did such a great job, Nikki had us do some takes to scream or to stand out of our seats all at the same time etc....This is an outdoor park venue and it was a great one to tape at! Sound is great, the light show and pyrotechnics were fab!!  Tommy had a little time with the microphone and was having fun with the fact that no alcohol was being served that nite, apparently the venue lost it's license earlier on in the week as there were minors caught with booze while attending the kid rock concert earlier that week!
Overall, such a great show and us Torontonians have so much luv for Crue.  The weather that evening was fab, the great thing that happened that night was that it did not rain at all except when the concert was over and we were walking out, it started to come down!  Perfect timing I'd say so the clarity I bet of filming was great!
I saw them again last week in Hamilton, with Hinder and Theory of a Deadman.  They sure pick the right bands to go on tour with!
I cant wait to see them again, so much fun!  You will luv this vid, I swear on it!!",1237075200,3,1248,4.106995884773663
3778386,5,B001RTCOYS,"Wonder, does this DVD have Subtitled or Closed Captions? Its a must to print on DVD. I attended the CrueFest in Denver, Colorado Summer of 2008. Its was a blast and being long time fan of Motley Crue since in the late 80's. Again, want DVD have Subtitled or Closed Captions, then I would buy it quickly.",1235433600,,303,4.333333333333333
3778387,5,B001RTCOYS,"I attended Crue Fest on its Cleveland, Ohio stop, and it was without a doubt the best concert I've ever been to in my entire life. The bands that performed there were Trapt, Sixx:A.M., Papa Roach, Buckcherry, and Motley Crue (in that order). All the bands sounded superb live. Trapt had a few mishaps, such as the microphone volume not being turned up loud enough. Sixx:A.M. also ran into trouble when their lead singer's microphone blew out and he continued to replace it in the middle of a song. Moving on, I was stunned to discover that there was a Crue Fest DVD being made only a few concert dates after the one I'd been to. This DVD has the potential of being one of the best for your viewing pleasures. I have not heard about any mishaps on this performance, which was in Canada, so I'll just assume that the quality of this will be good. In conclusion, I will be pre-ordering this DVD very shortly, and I hope several others will do the same. And let us all cross our fingers for Crue Fest 2..hopefully coming this summer.",1235260800,7,1029,4.421052631578948

I KNOW! She's since dropped it off with someone, with other books and movies and CDs and clothes and ... so, it's all awaiting me. Cannot hardly wait!

3778392,1,B001RTCOYS,"As other reviewers mention, Vince's performance is bad enough to kill the biggest fan's desire to own this DVD.
I've seen over 400 concerts.  Vince takes the cake for worst frontman performance I've ever seen with this one.
It's really a shame, because the rest of the band is still firing on all cylinders, even Mick after years of health concerns.
But when Vince takes to the mic, you'll want your money back.  It's ridiculous.

I challenge you to make it past ""Las Vegas, Nevada... Long gone is the wishing well."" on Wild Side.
You'll really only catch the line because you knew it before watching the video...
I'd have to pull up the lyrics to tell you what he says before that it's so unintelligible.
And that's an example of when he sings... As others mention, he skips over so many lyrics, this is only half the problem.

The moral of the story:
Vince owes it to his fans and bandmates to do better than this.",1353715200,,916,4.467065868263473
3778393,5,B001RTCOYS,"I love love love this dvd set!!!! Very well worth the money... Made me feel like I was actually at the concert. The bonus features are def an extra. Must be a true Crue fan to put up with Vince sharing the mic with the audiance..And of coarse enjoyed Buckcherry, Papa Roach... Sixx AM and Trapt!!",1327795200,,296,4.303571428571429
3778394,3,B001RTCOYS,"Still debating if the DVD was worth the price.

The pros: Great Bands!  Great musicians - especially Mick Mars guitar work

The cons:  * Vince's singing - Brutal, when he wasn't yelling in the mic he sounded whiny and not hitting half the notes.  The whole time I'm thinking the lead singer from SIXX AM can replace Vince ANYTIME please.

(cons con't) * I know it's called Crue Fest but would it kill to give the supporting bands some cool lighting and pyro too?  Buckcherry got some lighting but damn Papa Roach and SIXX AM got very little.  TRAPT got NOTHING, and just 2 or three songs from each band?  All designed to make Motley look that much better but they're  screwing the consumer.

So is the price worth the DVD?  Refer back to the title of review.",1277683200,,758,4.413043478260869

3778396,5,B001RTCOYS,"Carnival of Sins was an AWESOME show when I saw them and was lucky enough/paid enough to go back stage and meet them, and be front row dead center, 2+ hours of Motley was a dream come true, but, Crue Fest 1 was insane! minus Trapt of course, so was Crue Fest 2! Buckcherry is an awesome band, and I am sure anyone who has related and/or listened to the lyrics would agree. The song ""Too Drunk"" has the exact same ideals as Motley did back in the there day, I'm only 25 and I realize that. It's all about having fun, Partying, Women, if you actually gave Buckcherry a chance, you would see, unless your that close minded... I just ordered this DVD, and though I am sure it won't or couldn't be as good as there Red, White, and Crue tour video, it's still another to add to the collection. And the Carnival of Sins DVD should have NEVER been filmed in Grand Rapids!!! That audience was so weak and lame compared to Reno! The band should have picked a better city, but, like I said, it's another Motley disc and shouldn't even be whinning about it, cause all 4 original members are together and rocking! S.O.L.A.!",1262908800,,1110,4.315789473684211
3778397,1,B001RTCOYS,"This was a huge disappointment although it shouldn't have been. I should have expected this. I've seen the Crue as well as Vince ""solo"" many times. I thought maybe they could heavily edit this to make Vince look like he sang more than 50% of the lyrics. Do yourself a favor and buy the Iron Maiden Flight 666 DVD instead of this. That is how you put on a show. Tired of Vince mailing it in.",1251158400,,390,4.144736842105263
3778398,1,B001RTCOYS,"All I can say is thank goodness I didn't waste my money on this. Whoever posted the review that said Vince can't sing anymore was right. He missed half the songs and the other half he sounded like he was out of breath. I couldn't understand what he was trying to sing. He would try to hide his lack of vocal ability by holding his mic for the audience to sing or just scream some garbage. I'd be upset if I paid all that money for the concert only to sing the songs myself. They definitely should've overdubbed Vince's ""singing"". The rest of the band sounded pretty good. Don't get me wrong I like Motley and the new CD is pretty good. But Cruesfest 2008 leaves very little to be desired.",1249516800,3,688,4.259541984732825
3778399,1,B001RTCOYS,I hate to see Vince perform so bad but his singing is terrible and that is a fact you can't ignore.

3778401,4,B001RTCOYS,"DISC 1-the actual concert is best summed up on disc 2 where mick mars and tommy lee are talking afterwards about how mick missed the cue to wildside after kickstart,its a show that is sloppy at best .dont get me wrong this is a good concert but i reckon after they wished they had a better show to record.
one thing thats sticks out is that motley use a hell of a lot of backing tapes especially backing vocals which is disappointing surely they could get some backing girls again because it sticks out like dogs balls
also the titty cam is a bit tiresome now ,go do that big rollercoaster drum solo that you keep talking about tommy instead
but overall this is still motley loud and proud so shouldnt really comp-lain
DISC 2- this is actally pretty good haven't not seen any papa roach,trapt,sixx am ,buckcherry live stuff before a pity the actual full sets weren't put on would have been something else
and the docu stuff is good as well ,and mick and his banana you have to laugh

3778409,4,B001RTCOYS,"Good 2 DVD presentation of the famed 2008 Crue Fest tour. One factor I appreciated here was the fact that this live concert DVD was different than their 'Carnival Of Sins' trek I caught a couple of years ago. With DVD 1, I enjoyed {although the editing could be better} ""Wild Side"", ""Shout At The Devil"", their new offering - the power rocking ""Saints Of Los Angeles"", ""Primal Scream"", ""Looks That Kill"" and ""Girls Girls Girls"" the best. On DVD 2, I was fairly impressed with the performances by Trapt (almost forgot about this Los Gatos band), Papa Roach and especially Buckcherry. Overall, not bad for a three hour music DVD. I guess since Ozzfest is now taking a break, the summer music scene has left a door open for Crue Fest. What'll it be next - Kiss Fest?",1238889600,3,763,4.496402877697841
3778410,4,B001RTCOYS,"I attended Crue Fest last year.  Awesome show.  I watched the DVD once tonight, and I can tell you that I noticed some things immediately when I was watching it and throughout the entire DVD.  One thing that jumped out at me immediately was the sound quality.  Compared to the Carnival Of Sins DVD, the sound isn't as good.  It sounds more canned and mono.  I also noticed some not-so-spectacular film editing.  There are too many close-ups of the band members' hands, feet, heads, etc.  The editing in general is too fast-paced.  You'll see just a guitar on the screen for a .44 seconds, then you'll see a guy's head for .78 seconds, then the audience for 1.21 seconds, etc.  Get what I mean?  The transitions from scene to scene (such as when a song ends, and before a new song begins) are not edited very well, either.  The editing on Carnival Of Sins is far better.  Carnival Of Sins is edited at a fast pace, but it is a lot more watchable than this one.  Also, there seems to be more down time between songs on this DVD, whether it was intentionally or unintentionally done when editing, or the band taking more time between songs.  Also, I feel that some things that I saw at the actual live concert last year could've been included on this DVD.  The cameras could have captured certain things, such as the audience more and the overall surroundings.

I think one of the reasons why this DVD isn't as good as Carnival Of Sins is because the show's theme and the show itself, in my opinion, wasn't quite as good as on the Carnival Of Sins (Red, White, & Crue) tour.  In my opinion, the Carnival Of Sins tour and the carnival theme were their best show and theme in the history of the band.  That was a tough act to follow.  I understand that the band only plays for an hour and a half at Crue Fest, compared to much longer on regular tours from the past, so there are limitations as to what they can pull off compared to a tour like Carnival Of Sins.  Very simply, the Crue Fest 2008 DVD isn't as entertaining as Carnival Of Sins because the theme isn't as lively and visually stunning as Carnival Of Sins.  The editing of the DVD doesn't help either, as I said before.

Overall, this isn't a bad DVD.  It just isn't as good as their previous tour.  There is a good lineup of songs.  I don't think Vince Neil was totally 'on' that night.  He gives a weak performance on the opening song of the concert, Kickstart My Heart.  After that, he's pretty much typical Vince Neil.  If you listen closely, Tommy Lee misses a couple of beats later on in the show.  Other than that, a strong performance on the drums.  Mars and Sixx are great as usual.  I give this DVD 4 stars because any Motley Crue concert DVD is way better and more entertaining than most bands out there.  The second DVD in this set has footage from the other bands involved in Crue Fest (Trapt, Sixx A.M., Papa Roach, and Buckcherry) .  It is OK, nothing great, although the camera work and editing seems to be better than the first DVD.  I didn't care (and don't care) for those bands anyway when I saw the concert in Clarkston, Michigan on July 15, 2008.  With the exception of Sixx A.M., those bands are what I call ""concession stand bands"".  When they're on stage, I go to the concession stand and/or the bathroom, make a cell phone call or two, or just wander around the venue.  But I guess Motley Crue needs a few bands to fill up the time.  They wanted to choose current bands of today.  Unfortunately, the bands of today can't hold a candle to the bands of yesteryear.  Buckcherry is a terrible band who has a lead singer who thinks he's so cool.  The song Crazy Bitch (which appears on this DVD) is a good example.  It's as low as you can go.  The last song Buckcherry played at the concert I went to had something to do with getting incredibly drunk or something like that.  It was LOUSY, and the people I was with agreed.  No talent whatsoever, and stupid low-life pre-school lyrics.  If you want to buy just one of the two DVDs I mentioned, get the Carnival Of Sins DVD (if it's still available).  It is not dated (2005), just 3 years older than Crue Fest.",1238889600,3,4136,4.345098039215686
3778411,2,B001RTCOYS,"When I attended Cruefest (twice, by the by), I was completely blown away by the production value: lights, pyro, projections, you name it. This DVD however, is edited so that these things are either not showcased properly, or completely changed. Everything looks like it's in a red haze, which was not the case live.

I also thought some of the camera choices were questionable. I was excited at the performance to see so many times that Vince, Nikki, and Mick would line up in front and rock out together, and you barely see that on the DVD. Too many shots are close ups when they should be long shots, and vice versa.

Also, the sound is pretty terrible. There is some crowd noise, but I thought it was silly that when Vince would let the audience sing the choruses in many songs, all you heard was silence...

All in all, I would say to save your $20 to go towards your beer tab at Cruefest 2009",1238803200,3,897,4.391566265060241
3778412,4,B001RTCOYS,"When I purchased this DVD I thought wow, this is great!  5 bands / 2 DVDs this is a dream come true.  Unfortunately it is not so.

Motley Crue was just as great as can be expected from their live DVD sets.  Trapt was good, Sixx A.M. was great, Papa Roach was Great, but what the heck happened to Buckcherry???  I saw Buckcherry live at Woodstock '99 and they were one of the best bands at this event.  Unfortunately, all that greatness is not located on this DVD.  Other than three members, I do not think this is the Buckcherry I saw in '99.  Plus what the hell happened to revving up the crowd???  If this is Buckcherry's idea of a great return, maybe they should disappear for a while longer, and rethink about it.  It is unfortunate that because of this one band, this DVD gets a 4 star rating.  I can overlook Trapt considering they have only had one good song ""Headstrong"", but Buckcherry's first album was loaded with great tunes.  What happened???

Okay enough griping about Buckcherry, here are a few gripes for the Crue fans about Motley's performance.  Just one though.  Kickstart my heart was performed terribly, but there is a positive side to this problem, it was not a lip synced performance (Take that Britney Spears Fans).  The Crue have always played live, and the mistakes they make let you know that you are seeing the real deal and not some I can't sing, so I will just lip sync it performance.  However, I do wonder if part of the problem was due to the fact that the venue they were playing at did not allow alcohol???  It is mentioned several times on the DVD.

Enough with the review, here is the titles from the DVD.

3778413,2,B001RTCOYS,"I find this DVD to be unwatchable.  The video editing (like most live concert DVDs these days) was done in a way that the camera angle changes every couple of seconds (or quicker).  It gives me a giant headache to watch this DVD.  When are the producers of these concert videos going to learn that most people prefer concert videos that make you feel like you're actually at a concert, and not just watching some slickly produced MTV video?  The quick camera changes, cheezy slo-mo effects, and all of the red lighting throughout the concert make for a terrible viewing experience.  That being said, the audio is pretty cool.  It's always fun watching and listening to Tommy play the drums.  Just wish this video was better edited.  I actually like the Lewd Crued and Tattooed DVD better than this one (even though Tommy isn't playing drums).",1238198400,2,842,4.719178082191781
3778414,5,B001RTCOYS,"Let me start by saying I was also at Crue Fest 2008, the Maryland Heights (St Louis MO) show to be exact. This might make me a little more biased towards this DVD because it is a great memory for me, being it is a replica of the show I saw.

The mix is well done, very good for a live recording. The only drawback to it is when the crowd is singing along you don't hear them hardly at all, they are edited almost completely out of it. Not a bad thing through out most of the songs but I figured they might boost the audience a bit for the crowd sing a longs a little more. The bands however sound phenomenal, and the choice of songs from all the opening sets were good picks I thought. Very solid video, it is pretty polished.

As was already mentioned in another review, there are 2 discs. Disc 1 is the entire Motley Crue set, beginning to end, and the only weak song on here is Kickstart My Heart. Sadly, as it is the opener, Vince did pretty bad on the vocals here, and I don't recall him doing as poor when I watched them last year. Might have been just been a bad start for him.. The rest of the set is fantastic, vocals and all. Pyros, lights, fire, more pyros, a guitar solo from Mick, Tommy's infamous boob cam, and an encore that ends with Home Sweet Home.

Disc 2 is Trapt, Sixx AM, Papa Roach, and Buckcherry with some backstage/offstage footage clips and interviews with each of them. If you missed the show and like Motley Crue, I would definitely pick this up. If your buying it just for the opening bands, while they sound great there are only a handful of songs on here, so you might want to pass.

Here is the inside cover of the DVD case so you know exactly what songs/footage are in it are in it

3778415,3,B001RTCOYS,"I was considering going to the tour this summer, when it passed through IA. Thankfully, I saved myself the $65 and bought this instead.

The blinding red makes the dvd rather hard to see. Of course, Crue is the only one out of the numerous other concert dvds (own both this and carnival) that insists on the red lighting, making the show rather impossible to enjoy.

Top that off with the fact that Vince can barely sing his own crap any more. I get it, he's old, but if he can't get the job done, he needs to be replaced.

The setlist was great, the stuff with the openers was great. All in all, it was a great idea, just as poorly executed as the carnival dvd was.",1238025600,3,666,4.1875
3778416,4,B001RTCOYS,"Every ""review"" I've seen so far (3/24) has been from people who were at the show but nobody has said anything about the DVD, which is what you're buying right? Unless you're paying $20 to have the bands come and play at your house I guess. So I figured I'll tell you what you're thinking about buying since there's no real description yet from Amazon (although there probably will be by the time this posts... making me look like a bigger idiot).

It's a 2 disc set. On the first disc is Motley's entire 14 song set, from Kickstart My Heart until they close after Home Sweet Home. There's also Tommy T Cam in case you're wondering. On disc 2 you get 2 songs from Trapt (Contagious, Headstrong), 2 from Sixx A.M. (Pray for Me, Life is Beautiful), 3 from Papa Roach (Time Is Running Out, Forever, Last Resort) and 3 from Buckcherry (Lit Up, Sorry, Crazy Bitch). You also get a few bonus bits with a short documentary and 6 of Motley Crue's videos (White Trash Circus, Saints, Primal Scream, Looks That Kill, Live Wire, Kickstart).

So you know the bands, you know the songs, the sound quality is decent (5.1 and stereo) and the video footage was shot with 15 camera angles so you can see it all up close. Lots of value for the money.",1237852800,47,1231,4.394736842105263

It's more or less just yelling out the words rather than actually SINGING them.  When concert tickets cost $125 for a decent seat (and they were $11 the first time I saw the Crue in 1983), I expect a better show.

Word of warning.  If you're buying this to show your kids what their old man listened to 20 years ago (and maybe still today), do NOT let them listen to the Buckcherry song ""Crazy B*tch"".  He was disgustingly vulgar in that song and I was embarrassed for my friend that brought his TEENAGE kids to the movie.  I expected a few cuss words, but good lord he went a bit too far with the graphic sexual references.",1237420800,10,767,4.170068027210885
