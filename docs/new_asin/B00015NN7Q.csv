  Thank You",1206576000,,73,3.8
8006810,5,B00015NN7Q,"Keola Beamer is a masterful slack key player and his respect and love for the genre show greatly in this DVD. He is at times pensive, thoughtful, deliberate; and times kolohe.  It is very important to record and preserve traditional Hawaiian ways.  We are fortunate that Mr. Beamer has done so.  As son of the great Hawaiian kumu, Nona Beamer, he carries on the tradition.  Mahalo for sharing your craft, your aloha and your mana`o.",1173484800,4,432,4.72
