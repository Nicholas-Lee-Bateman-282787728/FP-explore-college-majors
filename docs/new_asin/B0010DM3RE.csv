The animated stories are interesting for young viewers and
holds their attention through out.",1498867200,,153,5.416666666666667
8237670,5,B0010DM3RE,"Not a very intense story but for my sensitive 4 year old grandson, the owl attacking the sparrow and Stewart was a bit scarey.  He will come to l;ike it in a year or two but we are going to put it aside for a while.",1363824000,2,215,3.6739130434782608
8237671,4,B0010DM3RE,"like the others in the animated series. good watching. when i ordered it i was expecting a TOY ... its is more of a keychain - flat plastic with a raised 3d stuart holding a pencil suspended from a hikers clip.  (look closer at image youll see what i mean)

my only disapointment is that of the animated series ""going for the gold"" has 4 episodes (89 minutes) not 3 episodes (67 minutes) like this dvd. why don't ALL have 4 episodes ?",1332374400,2,434,4.216867469879518
