2377779,5,B000A7DVMM,These dealers will have to drop their prices when no one buys. You'll find someone reasonable like I did. Any of the great Keaton films is better than this anyway,1230336000,,162,4.433333333333334
2377780,4,B000A7DVMM,"This package really doesn't have much more than you can find on a combination of public domain sources, youtube, and the Keaton Plus disc from Kino other than the featurette on the Italian Villa and the restored versions of 1935's ""The Invader"" and 1931's ""Parlor, Bedroom, and Bath"", complete with commentary tracks. ""The Invader"" is a British-made feature representative of Keaton at the lowest point of his life. ""Parlor, Bedroom, and Bath"" is an example of the kind of movie that MGM had Keaton doing in the early 1930's that brought him to that low point. The Columbia short ""Pest from the West"" is a much funnier and tightly made version of ""The Invader"" that shows a much more ""together"" Keaton in a film that tells the same story but with a length that is more appropriate - about 20 minutes. The version of ""Parlor, Bedroom, and Bath"" in this package is the only one I've ever seen that is remotely watchable - the restoration has really cleaned up the audio and video.

The TV appearances are mainly variations on Keaton's first film appearance in 1917's ""The Butcher Boy"" in which he did the Can of Molasses bit with Roscoe Arbuckle. There are two variations from the original in all of these bits:
a. Keaton lifts first one foot off the ground then the other in an attempt to get his feet out of the molasses and then falls to the ground - he also did this bit in The Hollywood Revue of 1929.
b. Keaton ultimately has to remove his pants to get out of the molasses, and is provided with a barrel to wear so he can leave the store, complete with turn signal. This second variation is because in the 1917 film Keaton is extracted from the molasses by being virtually catapulted by Arbuckle from the molasses to the outside of the store. This would have been a bit too physical for Keaton at age 60, even in his excellent shape.

Apparently scalpers have gotten hold of the word that this set is out of print and are pricing it at four times its original retail price - I believe originally it sold for twenty dollars. Trust me, that's all it's worth, even to collectors of everything Keaton, which is the intended audience.",1192924800,6,2133,4.523316062176166

Commentaries, extras, Easter Eggs and scores are all beyond compare.  Do NOT pass this up if you have a choice.",1189900800,3,481,5.561643835616438
2377782,4,B000A7DVMM,"It's a tough world for the Keaton fanatic. Once you have the giant Keaton Kino set, you really have all of Buster's best work. I mean, did he ever surpass his independent years?

Well, no.

That said, he often produced fascinating pieces, and found ways to shine in some really pitiful productions.

This set collects some real dreck, as well as some good stuff.

The good stuff -

The Playhouse - from a nice print that actually lets you see everything in the film. This is not a major improvement, but it's very nice to have.

The commercials - these are really a hodge-podge, but do show Buster at his 50's and 60's 2nd-chance heyday. The Alka Seltzer ones were particularly enjoyable, especially when Buster the mountie captures Buster the villian!!

Parlor, Bedroom, and Bath - Available many times before, but this time with a good commentary. More importantly, you don't have to give your money to some rip-off company for a low grade print.

Character Studies - an absolute gem of a brief piece of film.

The Home Owner - not the greatest film, but a really nice piece previously unseen, and with some quality Keaton gags. It's almost interesting enough to watch for fun.

It's also nice to have the promo and newsreel films in one place, and the tv appearances are good as well.

Then there are the ugly films -

Lester Snapwell - this film was already on the Kino box, and it's no better here. The soundtrack makes you want to break your furniture, and the gags are so slowly acted out that you feel it was made for the mentally challenged. But the music is really the worst. We didn't need this again. Not at all.

An Old Spanish Custom - some people like to see dead bodies, some people watch movies of disasters, and some people watch this film. It is awful. The commentary makes it almost bearable.

The Devil to Pay - somebody forgot to pay, and that's probably why this film is so awful. Unbelieveable.

I have no qualms with all these things being offered, and it's nice to have a lot on each disc, but buyer beware, some of this is really garbage, albeit garbage with Buster Keaton. You may not even get through parts of this set without needing a shower.",1154563200,27,2173,4.50765306122449
2377783,4,B000A7DVMM,"If you rate your DVD's by the amount of times that you have watched it then this would be right up there for me.  There is some excellent material on this DVD I really enjoyed the short movie called ""The Homeowner"".  I found all the commentary to be excellent also.  Plus it is a chance to see some quite rare Keaton TV Footage. This is a fine addition to any Keaton Collection.",1153353600,8,378,4.222222222222222
2377784,4,B000A7DVMM,"Buster Keaton was a prolific artist until the very end. ""Industrial Strength Keaton"" chronicles the comic legend's remarkable achievement from the silent era to the television age. There are many unearthed gems in this two-disc set - plus a few obscurities that should have stayed in the vault. Among the highlights: a reconstruction of ""The Playhouse"" (1921); rare newsreel footage from the 1920s and '30s; a plethora of live TV apperances and commercials; and a delightful, never-before-seen industrial film titled ""The Home Owner"" (in which Buster displays his honorary Oscar). The few surviving fiascos - such as the no-budget ""An Old Spanish Custom"" (1935) and the amateurish ""Devil to Pay"" (1960) - are strictly for Keaton completists. A decidedly uneven collection, but fascinating nonetheless.",1146441600,15,801,5.467741935483871
2377785,1,B000A7DVMM,"If you've seen everything that Keaton has ever done and you're excited about this new release, don't be. Many of the snippets have been seen before on other, more professionally produced DVD collections and with much of the content being from Keaton's later career, it's sad (and boring!) to watch him reduce himself to some of the work collected here. Seems this is a greedy attempt to make some money from bits and pieces scraped together and Keaton's name is exploited to do it. Do yourself a favor and watch Keaton at his best. There are many DVD collections that showcase this brilliant man and this is certainly NOT one of them.

Don't waste your money or your time. Very disappointing!",1142467200,15,692,4.7190082644628095
2377786,4,B000A7DVMM,"This new DVD set from Laughsmith Entertainment is a must for all Keaton fans to add to their libraries.

This 2 disc set has been put together with love and care for its' subject and presents some rare footage of the comedic master at work spanning almost his entire film career.

The first disc includes films from the 20s and 30s including ""The Playhouse"",""Parlour,Bedroom and Bath"" and a film I had only seen once years ago and in worse shape than this copy,""An Old Spanish Custom""(aka ""The Invader"").The latter is just about the WORST feature length film of his career,with a terrible plot and even worse supporting actors. Keaton himself was the only shining light but even his unique style and abilities cannot save this stinker. This version is only about 50 minutes long and I was under the impression it had been padded by its' makers to over the 60 minute mark...and the audio commentary while mentioning just this point does nothing to clarify the discrepency.

Also the first disc contains a special on Keatons'Villa of the 20s touching on such subjects as its' rennovation by its' new owners in recent years and the discovery of his films by actor James Mason,all the while taking us on a pictorial tour. Nice.

The second disc contains some live TV bits,commercials and three industrial films. Out of the latter three the best of the bunch by a country mile and one of the BEST things in this set is the industrial film called ""The Homeowner"".It is pure and unadulterated Keaton from beginning to end with some marvellous Keaton gags. Be sure to listen to the commentary on this one as its' discovery/recovery by film historian Richard Roberts is something of a small miracle.

The set is rounded out by a nicely put together booklet containing several articles by film historians/writers. Most are quite informative but there is some misinformation here. The first is by The International Buster Keaton Societies' own Patty Tobias. She vainly tries to revive the dead horse called ""Keaton was gyped in 'Limelight'"".That is Chaplin was so jealous of Keatons' scene stealing during rehearsals and ultimate shooting of his bit in that film that he excised much good footage of it so as to keep himself front and center. There has always been ALOT of rumour but no substantitive proof. Tobias approaches this old chesnut from a new direction. Included in the disc is a clip from the Martha Raye show of 1956 in which Keaton and Raye play the 'Limelight' routine. Because Keaton didn't play the routine out with Raye EXACTLY the way he did it with Chaplin ,Tobias would have us to believe something was afoot. Because after all(and this is where her argument goes up in smoke)this is the ""...same sketch he had just spent six weeks perfecting with Chaplin"". ""..Just spent...""??? 'Limelight' was 1952 .Rayes' show was 1956.

Three reasons why Keaton would NOT have played it exactly as with Chaplin? 1. Knowing Keatons' modus operandi you just know he wouldn't have played it move for move 2. Time restraints on a live show and 3. Raye was NOT a Charlie Chaplin.

Another article by Ken Gordon talks about Keaton losing control of his ""art"" when he went to MGM and that no comedians survived the transition to sound not even Laurel and Hardy who according to Gordon lost THEIR control when they went to FOX/MGM pictures in the 40s. Sorry Mr. Gordon but Laurel and Hardy are THE shining examples out of all the top echelon comedians that DID make it successfully into sound. Stan Laurel lost the creative control he had had at Roach studios when he went to Fox/MGM,because while Roach and he didn't always see eye to eye he(for the most part) left Stan alone to do what he had to do. At Fox/MGM he was just another employee. Now thats CREATIVE control,if you had talked about ACTUAL control then the only ones who had that were LLoyd and Chaplin because neither Keaton or Laurel and Hardy ever owned their own product.

These points aside however this set is definitely a must for all Keaton fans out there. It fills in alot of blanks that have been ""missing"" in his wonderfully brilliant career and brings the Keaton magic back to us all once more,solidly reinforcing his reputation as one of the few truly GREAT comic geniuses of 20th Century film.",1140739200,16,4258,4.744594594594594
2377787,5,B000A7DVMM,"If your a big fan of Buster's, you'll want this in your collection! Even my 9 and 12 year olds loved watching it and are big Buster Keaton fans.",1140480000,6,144,4.0
2377788,5,B000A7DVMM,"This collection is certainly for Keaton fans and silent comedy completists. But if you're ""in the tent,"" then you'll agree it's a very wide and satisfying collection of Keaton at his best during the second and third acts of his long career.

Although this 2-disc set suggests it is mostly concerned with the ""industrial"" films of BK's later career, the first disc is filled with material from his early years and stuff from the first years of sound and the MGM years in the 30s.  The producers have found a restored and presumably more complete copy of Keaton's amazing 1921 short ""Playhouse"" which isn't much different than the Kino version (including framing) except it's a little cleaner, and for a segment in the middle amounting to about 10 seconds which have been in the wrong spot in the short all these years!  ISK's version finally fixes that editing problem.  The commentary, by 3 of the producers of this set, is knowing, good-natured, non-stop, and not academic at all, although clearly these guys have done their research and know their subject.

Also on disc one is a cleaned-up 16mm print of ""Parlor, Bedroom, and Bath,"" one of the MGM talkies from 1931 that isn't as terrible as its reputation may suggest, and actually is a strong example of an early MGM-era talkie, and how Buster was managing to fold in his own gags and concerns.  The best part of the film is extended footage actually shot at K's home in Hollywood, the fabled ""Italian Villa"" and a redo of a train gag from his earlier silent short ""One Week.""  Again, the audio commentary is fun, very knowledgeable (these guys seem to know EVERY bit actor in this film), revealing and very good-natured.  The key to enjoying this film is to understand that it isn't (and can't be) another brilliant silent-era Keaton classic, but is instead a different type of film from another style of filmmaking.  P,B,&B is good enough fun.

As a bonus, there is a mini-documentary by historian Jack Dragga on Keaton's Italian Villa, called ""1 Parlor, 5 Bedrooms, and 6 Baths"" produced for this disc. It runs about 20 minutes and is a treat as it properly acknowledges how cool it is to see Keaton's Hollywood mansion in ""P,B,&B"" and get an insight into his lifestyle in the early 30s.

Also on disc one are a couple of early sound-era Shorts, ""Voice of Hollywood"" and a snippet from ""Hollywood on Parade"" (these kinds of things are mentioned in Eyman's ""Speed of Sound"" book about the talkies).  Finally, we end with ""An Old Spanish Custom,"" a 1935 feature (at barely 60 minutes) that Keaton did in England during his worst drunken years.  Interestingly, the film  although very low-budget, also has obvious gag contributions by Keaton, and has the familiar plot in which a conniving girl pretends to be in love with Buster to make another man jealous (we see it in ""Parlor, Bedroom..."" and in ""Spite Marriage"" as well).  The cinematography is by Eugen Schufftan, who worked for Rene Clair, Marcel Carne, and G. Pabst as well!

The commentary as well is knowledgeable, fascinating, and affectionate for this ugly runt of a film.  (Keaton would remake this film as a short at Columbia 4 years later, using some of the same gags.)

Disc 1 has 2 features, 2+ shorts, commentaries, extras, and we're not even to the ""industrial films"" yet!!

Disc two of ISK has commercials and the industrial films.  The first selection is of some sketches he did on live tv over the years, 4 of them are based on his first appearance in Arbuckle's ""The Butcher Boy"" with a can of molasses.  The version from 1957, with an actor that looks a lot like Billy Gilbert, has the best timing and is the funniest version, in my opinion.  There's some other bits (a Martha Raye version of the scene from ""Limelight"" (she ain't no Chaplin)) and a pretty good and elaborate paper-hangers bit from 1956 (and it's all done live!).  Then there is an extended collection of bits from commercials, ranging from Simon Pure Beer (these are great short black-out jokes - Keaton's in top form) to Country Club Malt Liquor (hmmmm), Alka Seltzer (very fun!), and a series of Jeep commercials called ""Lessons in Living"" from 1960.  Most of this stuff is really great.  You understand by watching this hour or so of stuff that Keaton really found a new niche in his ""third act"" of his life, being a funny often silent foil to sell products on t.v..  The comedy business is almost always pure Keaton-esque, and although he's quite older, he still takes great falls.

Finally, there are 3 ""industrial films.""  ""The Devil to Pay"" is indeed like an Ed Wood film, as mentioned in the notes, with voice-over, theremin-type cheesy music, and terrible acting and compositions, EXCEPT for the weird and out-of-place framing segments in which Buster, as the devil from another planet, comes down to Earth and inadvertently ""eliminates the middlemen"" in the US.  It's a gruelling, fascinating (and not very good) 20 minutes.

The next industrial is a recent find, ""The Home Owner"" from 1961 in which Buster demonstrates the joy of ownership for a company that was building houses in Phoenix, AZ.  This 20-minute film is an absolute joy.  Keaton was in charge of the writing (and probably the direction as well) and there are great timed bits of business, jokes, and the whole time this film really sells you on owning a house and living in this new (1961) community in Arizona.  Great work that really harkens back to the silent days, and is a great example of what an industrial film should do.

The set rounds out with the complete ""Triumph of Lester Snapwell,"" the Kodak promo film that was excerpted on Kino's ""Keaton Plus.""

If you're a fan of BK, and you've seen all the silents, and want to know more about the man, what he did after sound came in, and may even remember his face on t.v. in the 50s and 60s (am I aging myself?) this is an indispensible collection for you.  Much of this stuff is really rare and not to be seen since original broadcasting over 40 years ago.  The joy of the producers in having collected this package is also clear in the design and menus and commentaries.  Turns out BK was not a washed-up failure after 1929.  He just changed his career path.

""Keaton Plus"" another collection of this type, was light on the later commercials and industrials, but is worth owning for the fascinating ""Silent Echoes"" tour of K's L.A., the restored ""Hard Luck,"" and 2 of the better of the Educational Shorts.  This collection is different, but just as worth owning.",1139270400,53,6494,4.701413427561837

Little did I know of what a brilliant comedian and filmmaker he had been until much later. Not at all did I know about the circumstances leading to the films in this set and how poorly they are generally regarded. Well, don't worry; much like the reputation of the Fox Laurel & Hardy films, these Keaton films are a lot better than some will have you believe. The commercials are very good, indeed. The idustrial stuff is interesting, with occasional flashes of brilliance!

When compared to his earlier work, of course they are not up to standard, but think of how high that standard is! Who could keep that up forever? To enjoy these shorts to the fullest, just think of what passes for comedy today. Even at his worst, Buster was funnier than just about anyone on the planet.

The feature film is not nearly as bad as has been said. ""The Playhouse"" is great, of course, but there's very little more here than we already know about.

Another aspect of this set is the historical interest. Even if you watch them only for that, you'll get your money's worth. Hey, this isn't ""The Balloonatic,"" ""Cops,"" ""The General,"" or anything even close. But it's Buster Keaton, and that's ALWAYS cool!",1386460800,2,1419,4.552941176470588
