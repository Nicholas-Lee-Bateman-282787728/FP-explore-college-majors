7958446,4,B0000633UE,"Shaolin Temple (1982) is Jet Li's first movie and the first of a series of movies that resulted in the popularity of the Shaolin Temple in the west, and ultimately to the rebuilding of the real Shaolin Temple near Dengfeng (China). The story is not very deep, but the fight scenes are fun, especially as no ropes were involved. A classic.

Shaolin Temple 2: Kids from Shaolin (1983) is the second movie in the series. The story is artificially construed around the rivalry of a Wudang swordsmaster's family of girls and a Shaolin monk's family of boys. Nice fight scenes, but the ""comical"" scenes always give me the willies.

Born to defense (1986) is Jet Li's third movie, and the first and only movie that Jet Li directed himself. Even though the critics about this movie are generally very bad, I liked the movie very much: realistic fight scenes with no wires, none of the awful slapstick scenes, and the view of a historical situation from the other side, i.e. from the Chinese point of view. Yes, the villain and the good guy are pretty stereotypical, but still there are a number of surprising twists in the story. Also, I liked that even though Jet has great fighting skills and often wins the fight itself, none of the fights actually ends good for him.

All in all: two classics and one not-so classic that might still be worth seeing.",1177804800,6,1345,4.619246861924686
