Overall thoughts: This is a pretty good dvd set that shows many historical matches that took place from 1995-1999 for the In Your House series! There are a few matches that I wish had made this DVD set such as Goldust vs Ultimate Warrior from Good Friends, Better Enemies. Also either of the Dude Love vs Stone Cold matches from 1998 would also have been good or Undertaker vs Kane from later in the year. But either way, this DVD set is still a great one to own to relive the the greatest In Your House matches from the 90s! Hopefully if this set sells well--which should, we'll see a second set released down the line!",1360454400,26,3204,4.70990990990991

In Your House was the only WWE PPV i've only purchased, as it was only $15. While I do like the fatal 4-way match finally making it onto a dvd set, most the rest of the set has been released elsewhere. People can say well it's unedited but I say earlier matches weren't that bad to watch just the bleeping of WWF. I would have prefered earlier matches like Ramon-Kid Crybaby Match or the rare Vader-Ramon match. Pettingall outtakes should be fun. Disappointed by the content of the set but will buy no matter what.",1360281600,22,3099,4.735955056179775

5529803,4,B00AZL304M,"So, I just finished watching this set and I have to say that it is a good set even though a lot of the matches have been released before.  I used to love watching these shows back in the day.  They were kind of like the WWE's verison of WCW's Clash of the Champions except WWE's were always on PPV.  Good set but because of so many repeats from other sets I had to give this one 4 stars and not 5.  Here's what I thought:

The first match you get is from the first IYH and it's the opening match between Bret Hart and Hakushi.  This is a great match and a fun way to start the DVD set.  This match was also on Bret's first DVD release so most have seen it before, but if you haven't then this should be a treat for you.  Lots of fast paced action and great wrestling.  Worth checking out.

The next match is from IYH II and it's the IC title match between Jeff Jarrett and Shawn Michaels.  Again, this match was on one of Shawn's DVD's that was released so chances are you may have seen it already.  Great match and Shawn is really at the top of his game here having what seems to be, a lot of fun.  Most people call this a lost classic and after viewing it, it's easy to see why.

The next match is Dean Douglas defending his newly ""won"" IC title against Razor Ramon.  I say Douglas ""won"" the title because he didn't actually beat anyone for it.  He was supposed to wrestle Shawn Michaels for it but this was when Shawn was beat up for real outside a night club and had to forefit the title to Dean (although most people say he just didn't want to wrestle Dean that night).  So Razor was put in the match after Shawn handed the title to Dean.  The match with Razor and Dean was good and worth checking out.  Good match.

Up next is kind of a stupid match.  It's the Hog Pen match with Triple H and Henry Godwin going at it.  I say stupid because it is probably one of the worst matches in the history of Triple H.  It's just sloppy and just a waste of space on the set if you ask me.  Not worth seeing at all.

The last match on Disc 1 is the WWE title match between Bret Hart and the British Bulldog.  Great match but not as good as their IC title match at Summerslam 1992 (which in my opinion is one of the greatest matches of all time).  This match is good and Bret bleeds like a pig in the contest.  One thing that irriates me is Vince McMahon's commentary during the match and how he doesn't want the camera on Bret.  I mean seriously, how childish is that?  Let the cameramen do their job and you sit there and try to do yours (IMO one of the worst commentators of all time).  Liked this one a lot but again it was already released on Bret's first DVD set.

Disc 2 begins with Shawn Michaels defending the WWE title against Diesel in a No Holds Barred match.  This is a good match and shows Shawn's toughness but again, this is a match that has been shown multiple times on other sets.  Still good if you've never seen it before.

The next match is another repeat as Shawn defends the title again.  This time it's against Mankind.  This is a fantastic match but I've seen it so many times that I wish the WWE would have chosen another match.  Still, this one has it all (and I mean that literally).  Fantastic match!!

The next match is when Steve Austin takes on Triple H.  This was one of their first contests and it does kind of boggle the mind as to why it's on here.  It's an ok match but not great and the fact that both men were heels at the time just makes the fans sit there and not really care.  It is fun to watch these two at the time but still kind of a waste of space.

Up next is the Buried Alive match between Undertaker and Mankind.  Great match but again it has been shown before.  I still like this one though.  I like the idea behind the match and I like the action.  One thing is the ending when there's like 10 guys trying to bury the Undertaker.  It takes forever!  I don't anyone realized how long it would take to fill up the grave.  Still a fun match.

The next match is one I have been waiting for for years to be released on DVD.  It's the fatal 4 way match for the vacant WWE title and features Steve Austin taking on Vader taking on Bret Hart taking on Undertaker.  Fantastic match from start to finish.  Vader is great to watch in the match as he gets busted wide open.  I loved this match.  It's worth the price of the set alone.

Disc 3 begins with another repeat from the Canadian Stampede when the Hart Foundation comprised of Brian Pillman, Bret Hart, Jim Neidhart, British Bulldog and Owen Hart takes on Steve Austin, Legion of Doom, Ken Shamrock and Goldust.  Really good match and fun to see the Hart's so over in Canada and the Austin team is essentially heels here.  Good match.

The next match is another repeat and it features Shawn Michaels taking on Undertaker from Ground Zero.  This is a good match and worth checking out.  It is a repeat but at least it's not the Hell in a Cell match.  That one should be retired to the vaults.  Fast paced match and one of their best ones.

Up next is another one I have been waiting for.  It's the 8 man tag match with Triple H, New Age Outlaws and Savio Vega taking on Steve Austin, Cactus Jack, Terry Funk and Owen Hart.  Talk about wild and out of control.  This is a great match that has everything from chairs to shovels to trash can lids to barbed wire.  Well worth checking out.

Up next is the tag title match that features Steve Austin and Undertaker taking on Kane and Mankind.  Very good match with some good spots in it.  It's not as good as you would think but at least it's never been released before and worth checking out.

The next one is the IC title match between Ken Shamrock and Mankind.  This is a pretty good match and not a repeat but it's not good enough to be on here.  From this event which was Judgment Day in 1998 I would have rather seen the Undertaker/Kane match where Austin gets fired by McMahon.

The final match is from Saint Valentine's Massacre and features Rock and Mankind going at it in a Last Man Standing match.  Again another good match but it's another repeat again.  Still worth checking out.

The Blu-ray matches are as follows:

Up first is one that should have been on the main DVD set.  It's from Revenge of Taker and has Bret Hart taking on Steve Austin.  This is a great match (as most of their's is).  It's not as good as Wrestlemania or Survivor Series but it holds its own and I feel should have been on the main set.

The next BR match is when Taka took on Brian Christopher to crown a new Light Heavyweight Champion.  Fast paced and very underrated.  I would have liked to have seen this one on the set as well.  Well worth checking out.

The next BR match is another one that should have been on the main set.  We have Shawn Michaels taking on Ken Shamrock for the WWE title.  This is another lost classic and well worth seeing.  I thought Shamrock held his own against Shawn and was hoping to see more of these two but it never came to past.  Still this is a great one.

The last BR match is from Fully Loaded 1998 and featured D-Lo Brown taking on X-Pac.  It's a pretty good match but could have been left off.

All in all this is a good set but I was hoping for more matches that weren't seen before.  Some of what I wanted to see are as follows:

From IYH 4 I would have liked to have seen Diesel taking on British Bulldog for the world title.  That was a good match and would have been good on the set.  Definatly from IYH 6 the cage match with Bret and Diesel would have been awesome to show on here.  They always had good matches and that one was great as well.  From IYH International Incident the 6 man tag match with Vader, British Bulldog and Owen Hart taking on Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson and Sid would have been good as well.  Would have really like to have seen the stiff No Holds Barred match between Ken Shamrock and Vader from IYH A Cold Day in Hell.  That was a fantastic match.  From IYH Canadian Stampede I would have rather seen Taka take on Great Sasuke.  I love Sasuke and think that would have been a fun match to put on the set.  This isn't a match per-se but from IYH Fully Loaded 1998 I would have liked to have seen the biniki showdown between Sable and Jackie.  And lastly, from what is usually considered the last IYH from 1999 Backlash I would have liked to have seen Undertaker taking on Ken Shamrock.  The fans in the arena hated the match but I loved it.  Once again, great DVD set but I feel with the addition of some of these other matches instead the same old tried and true matches it could have been a better set.  Thanks for reading.",1381017600,4,8624,4.150635208711433

BEST OF IN YOUR HOUSE

Ah the mid 90's, was there ever a better time period for wrestling fans. WCW was finally getting up there in ratings against the WWF and competition was in the air. It was in fact that same competition that I speak of that lead to everything you are going to see here on this release. The WWF had at the time only the five major Pay Per View events that we all knew and loved. The Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, and of course the Survivor Series but that was soon about to change. WCW was starting to add more PPV's to their schedule so the WWF had to compete. Their answer was to create a two hour [at first] PPV called ""In Your House"". These events would be held in-between the ""big"" events. Eventually they would drop the ""In Your House"" from the title but we all remember those days for the good and the bad. This is the first volume of the ""best of"" and is hosted by Todd Pettengill.

1. BRET HART VS HAKUSHI-the first match on the set was also the first match on the first IYH PPV. This was Bret's first match of the night as he would go on to face, trick [fake leg injury], and beat Jerry Lawler later that night. First though he had to get through the ""modern day kamikaze"" Hakushi. This was a good opening match for that PPV and a good choice for this set. Hakushi was a different kind of opponent for Hart as he was more of an aerial based wrestler with his attacks. There was some great action here from moonsaults to both men going to the outside from a suplex. Hakushi and his manager Sinjin were not above trying to cheat to win but it would not be enough as Bret was able to get the win with a victory roll. Also it was cool to here Vince and Dok Hendrix [Michaels Hayes] on commentary, that takes me back.

2.[I-C TITLE]JEFF JARRETT VS SHAWN MICHAELS-one of the best matches that is always overlooked by fans when it comes to both guys. This match took place at the second IYH event and was probably the best match on the card. Both guys looked great here as did the Roadie who would get involved and even cost Double J the match at the end. Jarrett tried to stale the match many times going to the outside and then back in to break the count. Also it is funny when Vince's mic goes out and Lawler has free range for a short period of time. In the end HBK hits some sweet chin music on JJ and takes home the I-C title as a late B-Day present for at the time a record tying third time.

3.[I-C TITLE]DEAN DOUGLAS VS RAZOR RAMON-this match took place at the fourth IYH and was Ramon's second match of the night after competing in a tag match earlier in the evening. Dean had been awarded the I-C title shortly before the match due to HBK forfeiting the title due to injuries he received after he was jumped outside of a night club [this really happened]. So Dean had to immediately defend the title against Razor and both men delivered a good match. I for one have always been a fan of Douglas especially during his ECW days. I think he is very underrated as is this match since I still think it was one of the best of the night. The match is mostly Ramon with Dean getting in some good moments from time to time. That is of course everything except for the finish which seemed out of place. After a back body drop Razor drapes his arm over Dean for the three count but Douglas was able to get his foot under the rope, but the ref did not see it. The best thing about it was the guy with the black hair in the front row, his reaction still cracks me up. And I miss Lawler as a heel commentator.

4.[HOG PEN MATCH]TRIPLE H VS HENRY GODWIN-this match was back when Triple H was Hunter Hearst Helmsley and before the rest of his body caught up with that nose. Also in should be noted that Hillbilly Jim was the special referee for this match. This took place at the fifth IYH event and was a good match over all. You would think a match like this would be a pure brawl but you would be wrong. Yes it did have its brawling moments but it was more than just a fight at times. Of course over all this match was made to be the fun comedic match of the night. Hunter gets the win after sending Godwin into the pin. But afterwards he would also be thrown in even after he was slopped on.

5.[WWF TITLE]BRET HART VS BRITISH BULLDOG-also taking place at the fifth IYH this is one of my favorite matches form the early IYH events. These two had a classic in 92 at SummerSlam and when this was live on PPV I had no doubt that this would be as well. As I thought this was an excellent match and probably the best on that card and one of the best on this set. These two just had great chemistry from their tag matches to the singles. The match would see Bulldog control most of it really putting a beating on Bret and busting him open. But Bret stayed in the fight delivering some big moves such as a superplex. Bret would avenge that SummerSlam match with this one pinning Davey and retaining the title.

6.[WWF TITLE NO HOLDS BARRED MATCH]SHAWN MICHAELS VS DIESEL-the first match that the two had with the roles reversed as far as baby face/heel goes, and unlike last time HBK came to win. This was the classic no hold barred match between the two where Diesel [Kevin Nash] used Mad Dog Vachone's [not sure I spelled that right] fake leg as a weapon. This was for the time in WWF was a pretty hardcore match, I say for WWF because at the time ECW was alive and well. But for this company this was a great hardcore match before this was the norm in the company. There is a lot of good action in this match and the best friends turned enemies angle was working real well even after it started way back in 1994 between these two. To anyone who says Vince doesn't care about his wrestlers [at least some of the time] should check this one out. I never really noticed it before but when Nash goes to power bomb HBK into the table notice how Vince tries to grab the video monitor out of the way but it pops up into the air. Shawn wins this one after some sweet chin music is played for Nash. This match took place at the ""Good Friends Better Enemies"" IYH.

7.[WWF TITLE]SHAWN MICHAELS VS MANKIND-I remember watching this match and really being worried that Shawn may not keep the belt, because at the time Mankind was a whole new breed in the WWF. I had watched Mick before in WCW and ECW [who were in the house that night] and was well aware of what he could do. But I relaxed and knew Shawn would overcome this obstacle, still though this was the same guy [Mankind] that took it to the Undertaker so I knew it would be interesting. The match its self was great and very entertaining, the action in this match was very well paced and did not over do anything. It seemed to me that the story of this match played out very well and the Undertaker, Vader, & Psycho Sid appearances just added to the atmosphere. There were a lot of high spots in the match of course like the super kick off of the chair or both wrestlers falling from the top turnbuckle onto the table. Shawn takes a DQ victory for this unique match. This was not really a hardcore match or a traditional wrestling match but kinda a hybrid of the two, very unique feeling to this one. This is one of the most physical matches on the set and ever. This match brought out an aggressive side of HBK that we had not seen since he put Marty through the glass, this is one of my favorite matches on the set. This match took place at the ""Mind Games"" IYH.

8. STEVE AUSTIN VS TRIPLE H-the future of the company was competing right here in one of their earlier matches. Both were heels at the time which made the contest even more interesting in my opinion. Austin was scheduled to face Savio Vega and continue that feud but he was injured. The match itself was great with both men looking great and getting in a great opening contest for that event. This match took place at the ""Buried Alive"" IYH [more on that later]. Hunter was going to be facing former friend Mr. Perfect the next night on Raw. Perfect decided to go down to ringside and take Hunter's girl. This not only lead to Austin winning the match after a stunner but prior to that and encounter between Perfect and Austin.

9.[BURIED ALIVE MATCH]UNDERTAKER VS MANKIND-the first ever buried alive match featured two of the best from the WWF. This match was more of a fight and brawl than anything else. They would battle in the crowd, ring and even at the burial site. This was one of the most fun feuds in the WWF and this match also introduced the short lived Executioner character. Taker wins the match but Ex nails him with a shovel and along with Mankind and other heels of the time buries Taker alive. The horror movie like ending with Taker's hand is still great.

10.[WWF TITLE FINAL FOUR MATCH]BRET HART VS VADER VS UNDERTAKER VS STEVE AUSTIN-this match came about because Steve Austin had been eliminated at the Royal Rumble by Bret Hart. The refs did not see it so he came back into the ring eliminating Hart, Taker, and Vader to win. This of course could not be allowed so this Final Four match was established to crown the new WWF champ since HBK had to let the title go. This was a fun match with all four guys going at each other's throats, or should I say eyes. Vader gets bloody and nasty looking on his left eye. They could eliminate each other battle royal style or by the traditional pin or submission. Thankfully Bret Hart won the match and the title after some great action. Unfortunately he would drop the belt the next night on Raw to Sid, my brother and I are still upset by that.

DISC 2

1. HART FOUNDATION VS KEN SHAMROCK, LOD, GOLDUST, & STEVE AUSTIN-one of the best matches on the set. This match is full of legends and some of the best to ever lace the boots up. This took place at the ""Canadian Stampede"" IYH event in Canada so you know who the crowd was behind. This match was full of drama and had great atmosphere around it. There were countless great moments in this match and every time someone from the Hart Foundation lands a punch or anything the crowd came alive. I will say though that I loved when Owen came back down after he was sent to the back, the crowd loved it. This match was full of brawling as well as classic tag team maneuvers such as the original Foundation laying out some moves. The ending was great and the aftermath was a great moment for the Hart family.

2. SHAWN MICHAELS VS UNDERTAKER-this match was from the often forgotten IYH ""Ground Zero"" event which is still one of my favorites. This is one of the craziest matches these two ever had and is up there with every match they have had since. This is a crazy fight and brawl from the beginning and a good while into the match you finally hear the bell. That is right the first part of this match wasn't even officially part of the match. Taker really takes it to HBK here for costing him the title at SummerSlam. When the match finally starts it stays mostly Taker but Shawn showcases why he is the best  of all time in my opinion. One of the best matches the two ever had and that is saying something. I love how the refs keep getting knocked out so the wrestlers have to come out to break them up. Of course this leads to Taker diving over the ropes to still get at Shawn, this might be my favorite match of the set.

3.[NON SNACTIONED MATCH]STEVE AUSTIN, OWEN HART, CACTUS JACK & CHAINSAW CHARLIE VS TRIPLE H, NEW AGE OUTLAWS & SAVIO VEGA-still to this day one of the most fun matches of all time. I still wish it would have been DX & the New Age Outlaws but Shawn was injured and thus Savio took his place. This like the last just starts out as a brawl with weapons galore everywhere thanks in most part to the hardcore legends. Eventually the ref gets control and it turns into a tag match. It is at this point that one of the greatest and funniest moments ever happens. Steve Austin has a trash can in his hands and just launches it at Billy Gun as he gets into the ring. You have to see that moment to get it, it is hilarious. This match featured all the big feuds going into Wrestlemania so it was an important event. The ending comes when Austin stuns the Outlaws and gets the pin. Afterwards he stuns Chyna.

4.[WWF TAG TITLES]MANKIND & KANE VS UNDERTAKER & STEVE AUSTIN-great tag match right here as the tag champs were going in against a team that no one was sure could work together in Austin [WWF Champ] and Taker [future challenger]. The story here was great with Austin and Taker getting into it at various times and refusing to tag each other. Of course the tag champs Kane and Mankind worked together very well and took it to the challengers. Of course as it would turn out it would not be enough as Taker tombstoned Kane for the win. This was a great match that makes me want to go back and watch that whole IYH [Fully Loaded] and the SummerSlam that followed.

5.[I-C TITLE]KEN SHAMROCK VS MANKIND-man I really miss Shamrock I realize that now. I have been watching him since the first UFC event. So when he came into the WWF I was super excited [despite the feud with Dan Severn never materializing. This was a fun back and forth match with both men looking great here. This was a nice mix of brawling and in ring action. Mankind tapped up his middle fingers for this match like he had done in the past looking to apply the mandible claw. Little did he know that he would be using it on himself after Shamrock locks on the ankle lock. He does this in order to knock himself out. In doing so Mankind looses the match but does not give Ken the satisfaction of seeing him tap to the ankle lock. This was at the ""Judgment Day"" IYH.

6.[WWF TITLE LAST MAN STANDING MATCH]THE ROCK VS MANKIND-taking place at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" IYH and was another hardcore brawl between these two. These guys had some great matches and chemistry and this was more of the same. They battled all over the place and used every weapon they could get their hands on. That included the announcer's table, and speaking of that The Rock had a great moment here doing some commentary for his own match. These beat each other until they both could not answer the count leaving it as a draw and Mankind still with the belt.

BLU RAY BONUS MATCHES

1. BRET HART VS STEVE AUSTIN-the first bonus match was between ""The Hitman"" and ""The Rattlesnake"". These two always delivered when they got together and I still remember this match. Not as remembered as much as their other encounters but this was still a good one. Bret really tried to work Austin's knee over including doing his figure for on the post. That is still one of my favorite moves from Bret ever. Austin of course would fight back leading to the Hart Foundation getting involved. Austin wins the match due to a DQ at the ""Revenge of the `Taker"" IYH.

2.[WWF LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE]TAKA MICHINOKU VS BRIAN CHRISTOPHER-this took place at the great D-Generation X IYH and was the finals of the new Light Heavyweight Championship tournament. At the time the WWF was trying to bring in the faster littler guys and counter WCW's Cruiserweight division. I was so excited for this match because I had been loving the tournament leading into this. Thankfully it did not disappoint as booth men brought their A games here. Taka was obviously the quicker of the two and it showed with all of his high flyer maneuvers. Brian of course was the stronger and beat on Taka when he had the chance. The funny thing here was hearing J.R. and Lawler go at it over if Brian was King's son or not. But anyways after a great back and forth battle Taka gets the win and the new belt.

3.[WWF TITLE]SHAWN MICHAELS VS KEN SHAMROCK-like the last match this one took place at HBK's own PPV ""D-Generation X"". He would be defending the title against Ken Shamrock who I am a huge fan of. I had been watching Shamrock since the first UFC so I was a bit torn. But this is pro wrestling so I had to go with Shawn. This was a great match with Shawn doing all he can to survive Ken's onslaught. The WWF was making Shamrock look great here so HBK had help from Triple H and Chyna. This was a great match with Ken getting the win by DQ but it was the ending that most people remember with ""The Black Heart"" Owen Hart returning.

4. X PAC VS D'LO BROWN-two of my favorites were going at it here during one of the best feuds of the time, which of course was DX vs. The Nation of Domination. This was a non title match since D'Lo had stolen the European title. This was a great contest with back and forth action that would see D'Lo take the win. This was a good match and a good bonus match.

This was a fun set and really brought me back. It was cool to see Todd back again hosting this, I always liked that guy. The match selection was a good one especially for a first volume. I really hope we get a second and even a third if possible, I think there was enough events to do that.

5529823,4,B00AZL304M,"In present day WWE we have a pay-per-view event every month of the year but back from the late 80's to mid-90's, there was only 5 including WrestleMania & Royal Rumble & Survivor Series & SummerSlam & eventually King Of The Ring however that all changed in 1995 when WWE wanted to have a PPV event every month to combat WCW's heavy PPV schedule creating the events that have evolved into events what we now know today as Extreme Rules or Night Of Champions & formerly known as Backlash or Judgment Day but started out as a 2 hour PPV called In Your House. WWE's broadcast announcer from the mid-90's Todd Pettengill returned to host this set looking back at matches from the start of the concept in 1995 to the final ones in 1999.

Matches Include:
Bret Hart vs. Hakushi - This was the opening match from the very first ""In Your House"" PPV and one of two matches Bret was scheduled to wrestle that night as he also had a match against Jerry Lawler & for those who don't remember Hakushi, he's the japanese wrestler who would also wrestle under the name Jinsei Shinzaki & probably most remembered for his classic tag team match he had against Rob Van Dam & Sabu at ECW's Heatwave PPV in 1998 (on ECW: Unreleased Vol. 1 DVD). This match was a different one than Bret usually has since Hakushi had a different offense than other WWF wrestlers at that time since he was very athletic & used various aerial moves like the Asai Moonsault & a tight-rope walk on the top ropes similar to Undertaker's ""old school"" while also working over Bret's arm & utilizing his manager Sinjin whenever he could to break the rules. This was a nice encounter but really seemed like it was missing something to really make it standout or memorable.

Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Shawn Michaels - This started out with each man trying to show off & ""one-up"" each other such as Jarrett doing HBK's pose on the top turnbuckle & Shawn doing Jarrett's strut resulting in Jarrett tried to break Shawn's momentum by constantly stalling on the outside & breaking the referee's 10 count at 9 to avoid a count out. When the match continued, Roadie tried to get involved only for Shawn to not only toss Jarrett onto Roadie on the outside but also dive onto both men from the top rope. Jarrett was able to regain the momentum when he back dropped Shawn over the top to the floor opening the door for Roadie to get involved as both men choked Shawn on the ropes, connecting with his own clothesline off the apron, and causing Shawn to lose his balance on the top rope allowing Jarrett to hit a superplex. Both men continued to trade momentum but Roadie got involved one too many times that not only resulted in a Sweet Chin Music that not only knocked Jarrett out for a three count but both men out of the WWF for the time being. This is a very underrated match in both men's careers due to the fact that it happened during a period that WWF was very low on viewership & crossover appeal along with the fact that it didn't happen on one of their bigger shows but this was definitely a ""lost classic"" encounter in both men's careers with a funny side note here but there was a moment when Vince's headset wasn't working with Lawler having fun at his expense.
[Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story]
July '95

WWF Intercontinental Champion Dean Douglas vs. Razor Ramon - A couple of notes here in that Shawn Michaels forfeited the championship to Douglas due to being attacked days earlier while this was Razor's second match of the night. Razor was dominate with his trademark punches & heavily working over Douglas' arm with armbars & stretches while constantly knocking Douglas to the outside before Douglas was able to get some offense in taking advantage of where Razor was in the ring before Razor quickly took it back countering Douglas offense both coming off the top rope & in the ring. Despite the ending being very confusing at first, this was pretty much a dominate performance by Razor that's only memorable for how history was being made on more than one occasion throughout this entire scenario with the Intercontinental Championship.
Oct. '95

Hog Pen Match: Henry Godwinn vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - A couple of notes here in that Helmsley was still undefeated in singles competition at this point, Hillbilly Jim returned to the WWE to be the special referee here while Jerry Lawler spent a lot of time on the commentary doing Jeff Foxworthy jokes about Henry Godwinn's hometown. Godwinn went to slop Hunter right from the start only to miss & end up getting the ring announcer & front row but eventually did get Hunter when tied up in the ropes which only caused Hunter to get very aggressive with his offense only for Godwinn to be able to get aggressive himself sending Hunter into the outside steps. They made their way to the hog pen various times with both men either being thrown against it or one instance where Hunter landed on top of it only to come off it with an elbow drop. While the match stipulation was very comedic (as they usually were during this time in WWE), they made the best of this here.

[Triple H: King Of Kings]

WWF Champion Bret Hart vs. British Bulldog - It took over 3 years but this is the rematch to their famous encounter from SummerSlam '92 however the circumstances in this match were completely different than their previous one as Bulldog was a full time heel managed by Jim Cornette & Diana Hart (Bulldog's wife & Bret's sister) was mutual at SummerSlam but in complete support of her husband for this match while it should also be noted that although Lawler tried to point out that Bulldog wore the exact same tights that he wore at SummerSlam, they weren't. Bulldog used his strength to wear Bret down various times like throwing Bret into the ring ropes from the superlex position, delivering his famous powerslam on the floor, and Jim Cornette taking a cheap shot. Bret resorted to some high impact offense of his own like the piledriver, superplex, suicide dive to the outside, and even tactics like crotching Bulldog on the guardrail & holding the tights during a pin attempt as this match was also one of the rare times during this period of WWE (and Bret's career in general) where there was a heavy amount of blood as Bret was busted open & heavily bleeding after going face first in the steel steps on the floor. While their match at SummerSlam is more memorable, I actually enjoyed this encounter better as they just flowed better here.

[Bret Hart: The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be]

No Holds Barred Match: WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel - The buildup to this match was very unusual & different than what we've seen in WWE pre-Attitude Era as far as Diesel having a ""shoot"" persona where he openly acknowledged Vince McMahon as the owner instead of just the color commentator while threatening to come for him after the match based off his frustration of changing him into a ""corporate puppet"" while champion while Shawn was out for revenge for Diesel turning his back on him & attacking him with a chair. HBK took the fight to Diesel right away showing his athleticism with a top rope moonsault to the outside while also showing he can get dirty too using a boot from the spanish announcer before Diesel took advantage of the match stipulation taking out anyone he felt got in his way & using weapons like a belt & chair while delivering to low blow before sending Shawn through the announce table that even Vince at ringside felt was going too far but both men continued to just use whatever they could get their hands on from a fire extinguisher, a chair, and something from wrestling legend Mad Dog Vachon at ringside that you have to see to believe. I said this earlier in that this match was pre-Attitude Era & ECW was still not known to a national audience so it was rare to see this type of match using the weapons & punishment they gave each other during this time so this match was definitely a classic for it's time & still stands the test of time to this day.

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind - Paul Bearer pushed a casket with Mankind inside of it before the match & you got the tone of what this match was going to be within the first few minutes when both men took it to the floor with Shawn stomping on the outside mat with Mankind underneath it, delivering a flying crossbody to the outside & whipping his head back onto the concrete floor. This match quickly evolved into a brawl with both men throwing fist & going back to the outside with Shawn targeting the leg after delivering a suplex that resulted in Mankind's leg slamming into the steps followed by driving the leg into the casket & various submissions. Mankind fought back working over Shawn in corner with two double axe handles in the Tree Of Woe but also took punishment as his knee once again ran into the steps, took a drop toe hold to the face, and his head wrapped between the ropes but still able to catch Shawn in the Mandible Claw which caused Shawn to focus on that hand as he attacked it using a chair multiple times & stomps. Both men traded momentum from here with both taking the punishment together such as a superplex through the outside table & Mankind getting a superkick to the face with a chair on the top rope before various associates got involved. Foley stated that this was the best match in his career in his first book, Shawn would later state that this was his favorite match during his first WWE Championship defense during the ""Boyhood Dream"" run, and various people claimed this to be the match of the year for 1996 as this was a standout encounter in both of their careers.

Steve Austin vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - Almost 3 years before the would have their more famous feud over the WWF Championship, they met here for the first time in a match due to Savio Vega's injury that made this a rare match at this time with two heels facing each other. Both men tried to intimidate each other with shoves & slaps including one slap that knocked the other guy down before wrestling a back & forth encounter. However the bigger issue here was Mr. Perfect, who was already scheduled to face Hunter the next night on RAW in his return match, coming down causing a distraction to Hunter but also ended up getting into a confrontation with Austin as well. This was a good match seeing how both men were heels at the time but was more about hyping up the match for RAW the next night & as a side note that if you know the storyline between Jim Ross & Vince McMahon at the time then you'll get a laugh at the commentary.
""Buried Alive"" Oct. '96

Buried Alive Match: Undertaker vs. Mankind - As usual when it came to whenever these two men fighting each other, this was a brawl that was hardcore before the word ""hardcore"" was ever used in WWF as they went all over the place from the ring to ringside & through the crowd down to the actual grave. They used everything they could get their hands on from microphone cords to a sharp object that Paul Bearer brought into the match. Other objects were used like Mankind giving Undertaker a chairshot before Taker would later use the chair to give a legdrop onto Mankind's face along with the steel steps being driven into Mankind's back & face. Just like Undertaker's later encounters like the Hell In A Cell vs. Shawn Michaels & the Inferno Match vs. Kane, this was a first for it's kind and something to watch from beginning to end and even after the match.

[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

WWF Championship/Final Four Match: Bret Hart vs. Undertaker vs. Steve Austin vs. Vader - This was a very unique type of match in WWE history that was setup under unusual circumstances which we haven't seen since as Austin was eliminated in the 1997 Royal Rumble but the referees didn't see it causing Austin to come back in & eliminate the other 3 men to win the Rumble causing this setup to happen where they would all meet with elimination happened by pinfall or submission or going over the top rope with the winner now becoming the WWE Champion due to Shawn Michaels forfeiting the title earlier in the week. This match was non-stop chaos from the opening bell as there was a moment where everyone fought each one of the other competitors at one time or another making for various highlights like Vader getting a chair & steps thrown into his face within' the opening moments causing him to wear the ""crimson mask"" throughout the entire match, anything they could get their hands on being used as a weapon including the guardrail & chair & steps & the title belt itself, fighting in & out the ring to the isleway & in the crowd, Steve Austin's non-stop obsession with Bret Hart, and everyone resorting to desperate tactics to win such as the amount of times Vader was on the receiving end of a low blow. It was a unique match for it's time & would still stand the test of time today against most ""Fatal Four Way"" matches that have happened since but more importantly, this was the standout performance for Vader that hasn't been seen since his match with Shawn Michaels at SummerSlam months earlier.
""Final Four"" Feb. '97

Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust, Legion of Doom vs. Hart Foundation - The Hart Foundation returns home to Canada for this main event where they were received a hero's welcome from the crowd with members of the Hart Family sitting front row ringside. This was a wild & emotional tag team match just based off the environment alone that had various highlights like Austin & Bret starting out, Austin constantly showing that he thought Canada was #1, Pillman mocking Shamrock & paying for it, Bulldog showcasing his power various times, the constant teamwork of the Hart Foundation including classic tag team moves from the original Foundation in Bret & Niedhart, Austin resorting to using a weapon to take out Owen Hart only for Bret to give a receipt, Pillman making an ass of himself at one point, all out brawling between both teams in & outside of the ring, and Austin trying to fight the entire Hart family. This was a great tag team match from the action in & out of the ring to the hot crowd throughout the match to the emotional aftermath with all the Hart family in the ring together which Bret Hart has testified to himself saying it was the last time their entire family was united together.

[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon; Hart & Soul: The Hart Family Anthology]

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels - Although these two are most remembered for their later encounters like Hell In A Cell & Casket Matches, this was the rare forgotten first one-on-one match they ever had against each other. This was one of those crazy encounters that just started off wild & never stopped as Shawn was heavily trying to avoid & running away from Undertaker at all cost to the point where Taker got heavily impatient & threw the referee over the top rope onto Shawn. To steal a line from Steve Austin, Taker ""opened up a can of whoop-ass"" on Shawn Michaels from that point forward by beating him up the ramp, on the stage including a press slam that you just knew had to hurt, down the ramp to the point where Shawn was begging for the referee to stop the match but there was one problem...the match didn't even start yet. This match was just crazy from start to finish with Shawn heavily trying to rely on his partnerships with Triple H, Chyna, and Rick Rude while the referees kept getting abused & wrestlers had to come out from the back to try to separate these two before Taker delivered a ""highlight reel"" moment just to get more of Shawn.

Non-Sanctioned Match: Steven Austin, Owen Hart, Cactus Jack, Chainsaw Charlie vs. Triple H, New Age Outlaws, Savio Vega - This was originally set to be a preview of the upcoming WrestleMania with all four men having issues with members of the opposite teams but Shawn Michaels didn't participate due to injury causing Savio Vega to replace him. You knew what direction this match was going in when all the members of Triple H's team came out with a weapon while Cactus & Chainsaw came out with a cart full of them as this match had close to 10 minutes worth of just out of control fighting with the weapons (too many to try to list) in & out of the ring while also delivering some harsh punishment like a two man powerbomb through open chairs & Austin launching a trash can from the apron to Billy Gunn in the ring that knocked him down on impact. The match settled down for a bit with Triple H's team focusing on the older Chainsaw Charlie before things picked up again & got wild again such as Billy Gunn thrown into the corner where Road Dogg was underneath a piece of table, Cactus being covered in barbed wire, and unprotected chairshots. This was definitely ""hardcore"" for it's time in WWE but stay tuned afterwords as you got quite the visual of who Austin gave the last stunner to.

[D-Generation X]

WWE Tag Team Champions Mankind & Kane vs. Steve Austin & Undertaker - While this type of match setup has been done various times in recent years, this is the first time I remember it actually happening where the current singles champion is teaming with his future challenger to face the tag team champions as Austin & Undertaker were already set to meet at SummerSlam for the WWE Championship but had to team here against two men they've been having issues with for months in Kane & Mankind while everyone was unsure if Kane & Undertaker had an alliance together. Undertaker had arrived to the building around a half hour before the match & went to confront Austin during his entrance in the isleway before Kane & Mankind attacked from behind bring the match to the ring as we saw that Austin & Taker kept having their issues against each other with both men giving each other the finger, having staredowns during the match, kept trying to fight both men by themselves, and not reaching for a tag when his partner was down while Kane & Mankind showed teamwork by working together, making multiple tags, and having the partner work on the opponent on the outside while the legal man had the referee distracted. This was a good tag team match not only by the action inside the match but the story between the partners of Austin & Undertaker as well.
""Fully Loaded"" July '98

WWE Intercontinental Champion Ken Shamrock vs. Mankind - Mankind came into this match with his fingers taped up for the first time in a long time like how he used to when originally applying the mandible claw as Shamrock took control heavily working over his arm with an armbar takedown followed by various stretches like the hammerlock while being able to remain one step ahead of Mankind countering his offense including the mandible claw. Mankind was able to get an advantage on the outside sending Shamrock into the steps but was able to regain the advantage when Mankind tried to interject a chair into the match while still working over the arm. Mankind was able to finally start gaining some momentum with a double arm DDT, attacking Shamrock in the tree of woe, and his trademark Cactus Jack offense of a clothesline taking both of them over the top rope followed by the elbow off the apron but Shamrock was able to regain the advantage on the floor with a powerslam that send Mankind's legs into the steps. This was a nice back & forth match.
""Judgment Day"" Oct. '98

Last Man Standing Match"" WWE Champion The Rock vs. Mankind - Mankind came into this match with a bad knee due to Rock attacking him earlier in the night as Mankind purposely turned his back on Rock allowing him to get the first punches in before he retaliated using the championship belt. The fight went to the stage & technical area where both men took hard falls like a DDT through a table & suplex on the concrete as they made their way back to ringside where he had a few comedic moments from The Rock on commentary to Mankind's ""Mr. Elbow"" & later some ""SmackDown Hotel"" before they got more violent using whatever was near them such as the announce table, chair, and the steps including one moment where Rock dropped the stairs out of the ring onto Mankind's knee on the outside causing Lawler to comment, ""It's getting out of hand now."" This match followed the formula of their previous matches in this feud (I Quit & Empty Arena) where it was a physical hardcore brawl where they beat each other until they had nothing left...literally.

(Blu-Ray) Steve Austin vs. Bret Hart - While Bret & Austin had numerous matches against each other before, this one was under a completely different set of circumstances as Bret recently turned his back against his American audience & reunited with Owen Hart & British Bulldog as the new Hart Foundation while Austin was the fan favorite going into this match & was also attacked earlier in the night. Both started out trading fist with Austin getting the early advantage sending Bret into the outside steps & guardrail before briefly going into the crowd while Bret had to resort to tactics like using the referee & a chair to regain the advantage. Bret targeted Austin's knee using the figure four in the ring & on the post while also removing his brace while Austin kept trying to fight back as the match got taken to the outside once again in the crowd & ringside while Austin was showing the effects of Bret's work on his knee. Both men proceeded to almost try to out-cheat the other throughout the match as Austin used tactics like like a low blow, choking Bret with tape, and using his knee brace while Bret did a low blow of his own & attempt to get help from his fellow Hart Foundation members before Austin retaliated using a chair himself & catching Bret in his own Sharpshooter various times. While this wasn't a classic like their Survivor Series & WrestleMania encounters, this was still a quality match with both men.

(Blu-Ray) WWE Light Heavyweight Championship Match: Taka Michinoku vs. Brian Christopher - This was the beginning of WWE's attempt to counter WCW's highly praised crusierweight division with their own Light Heavyweight Championship tournament with this match being the finals. Brian had the power advantage tossing Taka around early while Taka showed he had superior speed with his dropkicks followed by going arial with a springboard crossbody to the outside which Brian tried do himself with a top rope dive to the outside but ended up landing on the guardrail that busted open his lip. Both men traded back & forth with Taka's quick flash offense such a tornado DDT, frankensteiner, springboard moonsault to the outside & various dropkicks to the back of the head & face while Brian responded with a full nelson takedown, sitout powerbomb, along with receipts to the dropkicks to his face & back of the head. This was a sign of the potential the division had as both men worked a fast paced high flying style that definitely stood out.

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Ken Shamrock - Shamrock showcases his superior strength early with a hard kick that knocked Shawn right to the outside, tossing him across the ring & an irish whip that was so hard that he sent over the top rope into the isleway before Shawn was able to get some punches in only for Shamrock to keep shoving him off performing various body shots while once again sending Shawn to the outside with a clothesline. Shawn had to resort to taking advantage of the referee along with Triple H & Chyna attacking Shamrock on the outside to regain the advantage while performing such moves as the top rope crossbody & splash off the apron while grounding Shamrock in the ring with a sleeper hold but Shamrock started to build momentum by countering & reversing Shawn's offense while also delivering some of his own like a frankensteiner. This was a good match between the two as both men had different styles but were able to mesh well here but the more important issue was after the match when a ""nugget"" from Shawn's past came back to haunt him.

Both men started off exchanging takedowns with Pac getting the better of the exchanges taking D'Lo down with his various kicks but D'Lo was able to whip Pac hard into the corner with his neck having a whiplash effect leaving an opening for D'Lo to focus on the neck with grounded holds like the chinlock along with impactful moves moves from a stiff clothesline to dropping his leg & elbow across the neck. They would go on to have better matches trading off the European Championship months later but this was still a good encounter.

Blu-Ray extras (which only last around 4 minutes) are outtakes of Pettengill hosting this set & archival footage of a tour of the house given away by WWE on the very first PPV with the kid who won it.

One thing you'll notice right off the bat when looking at this set is that a high majority of the matches on here have been released in the past on another DVD set which would be a problem for heavy collectors but only one of them have been released in a DVD set within the over the last 3 years while others haven't been released in around 5-8 years so it was time to have them released to a new audience with WWE not putting the same matches from recent sets on here while also including some rare forgotten gems. The action itself is pretty much quality from top to bottom while this was the most tolerable Todd Pettengill has ever been in WWE hosting this set including making some jokes at himself (it could have been worse & see Michael Hayes revert back to Dok Hendrix). Your not going to get every single quality match from all these series & I doubt we'll see an anthology so as proven by the sales of the ""WCW Monday Nitro"" & ""ECW Unreleased sets"" that there's always room for a volume 2 if enough people buy this.

5529835,4,B00AZL304M,"This box set is a great representation of the WWE's  greatest superstars of the 1990's. All of the greats, such as Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, British Bulldog, Mick Foley, Steve Austin, Jeff Jarrett and Triple H have awesome matches in this collection. There are also some lesser known superstars who finally get a chance to shine once again in this box set. There is not a single bad match in this box set. The best part about these matches in the fact that most of them have never been released on dvd in the United States until now. The box set's artwork is a nice touch, because it looks like it came straight out of the 1990's. I also want to mention that the box set's menu music, a song sung by the Road Dogg (the REAL Double J), is an awesome bonus. The only complaint I have with this box set is the fact that a few matches, such as Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind, have already been on quite a few previously released box sets. Overall, I believe that this box set is an essential purchase for fans of WWE's New Generation era, as well as the Attitude era.",1367971200,2,1060,4.3
5529836,4,B00AZL304M,"In present day WWE we have a pay-per-view event every month of the year but back from the late 80's to mid-90's, there was only 5 including WrestleMania & Royal Rumble & Survivor Series & SummerSlam & eventually King Of The Ring however that all changed in 1995 when WWE wanted to have a PPV event every month to combat WCW's heavy PPV schedule creating the events that have evolved into events what we now know today as Extreme Rules or Night Of Champions & formerly known as Backlash or Judgment Day but started out as a 2 hour PPV called In Your House.  WWE's broadcast announcer from the mid-90's Todd Pettengill returned to host this set looking back at matches from the start of the concept in 1995 to the final ones in 1999.

Matches Include:
Bret Hart vs. Hakushi - This was the opening match from the very first ""In Your House"" PPV and one of two matches Bret was scheduled to wrestle that night as he also had a match against Jerry Lawler & for those who don't remember Hakushi, he's the japanese wrestler who would also wrestle under the name Jinsei Shinzaki & probably most remembered for his classic tag team match he had against Rob Van Dam & Sabu at ECW's Heatwave PPV in 1998 (on ECW: Unreleased Vol. 1 DVD).  This match was a different one than Bret usually has since Hakushi had a different offense than other WWF wrestlers at that time since he was very athletic & used various aerial moves like the Asai Moonsault & a tight-rope walk on the top ropes similar to Undertaker's ""old school"" while also working over Bret's arm & utilizing his manager Sinjin whenever he could to break the rules. This was a nice encounter but really seemed like it was missing something to really make it standout or memorable.

Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Shawn Michaels - This started out with each man trying to show off & ""one-up"" each other such as Jarrett doing HBK's pose on the top turnbuckle & Shawn doing Jarrett's strut resulting in Jarrett tried to break Shawn's momentum by constantly stalling on the outside & breaking the referee's 10 count at 9 to avoid a count out. When the match continued, Roadie tried to get involved only for Shawn to not only toss Jarrett onto Roadie on the outside but also dive onto both men from the top rope. Jarrett was able to regain the momentum when he back dropped Shawn over the top to the floor opening the door for Roadie to get involved as both men choked Shawn on the ropes, connecting with his own clothesline off the apron, and causing Shawn to lose his balance on the top rope allowing Jarrett to hit a superplex. Both men continued to trade momentum but Roadie got involved one too many times that not only resulted in a Sweet Chin Music that not only knocked Jarrett out for a three count but both men out of the WWF for the time being. This is a very underrated match in both men's careers due to the fact that it happened during a period that WWF was very low on viewership & crossover appeal along with the fact that it didn't happen on one of their bigger shows but this was definitely a ""lost classic"" encounter in both men's careers with a funny side note here but there was a moment when Vince's headset wasn't working with Lawler having fun at his expense.

WWF Intercontinental Champion Dean Douglas vs. Razor Ramon - A couple of notes here in that Shawn Michaels forfeited the championship to Douglas due to being attacked days earlier while this was Razor's second match of the night.  Razor was dominate with his trademark punches & heavily working over Douglas' arm with armbars & stretches while constantly knocking Douglas to the outside before Douglas was able to get some offense in taking advantage of where Razor was in the ring before Razor quickly took it back countering Douglas offense both coming off the top rope & in the ring.  Despite the ending being very confusing at first, this was pretty much a dominate performance by Razor that's only memorable for how history was being made on more than one occasion throughout this entire scenario with the Intercontinental Championship.
Oct. '95

Hog Pen Match: Henry Godwinn vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - A couple of notes here in that Helmsley was still undefeated in singles competition at this point, Hillbilly Jim returned to the WWE to be the special referee here while Jerry Lawler spent a lot of time on the commentary doing Jeff Foxworthy jokes about Henry Godwinn's hometown.  Godwinn went to slop Hunter right from the start only to miss & end up getting the ring announcer & front row but eventually did get Hunter when tied up in the ropes which only caused Hunter to get very aggressive with his offense only for Godwinn to be able to get aggressive himself sending Hunter into the outside steps.  They made their way to the hog pen various times with both men either being thrown against it or one instance where Hunter landed on top of it only to come off it with an elbow drop.  While the match stipulation was very comedic (as they usually were during this time in WWE), they made the best of this here.

WWF Champion Bret Hart vs. British Bulldog - It took over 3 years but this is the rematch to their famous encounter from SummerSlam '92 however the circumstances in this match were completely different than their previous one as Bulldog was a full time heel managed by Jim Cornette & Diana Hart (Bulldog's wife & Bret's sister) was mutual at SummerSlam but in complete support of her husband for this match while it should also be noted that although Lawler tried to point out that Bulldog wore the exact same tights that he wore at SummerSlam, they weren't. Bulldog used his strength to wear Bret down various times like throwing Bret into the ring ropes from the superlex position, delivering his famous powerslam on the floor, and Jim Cornette taking a cheap shot.  Bret resorted to some high impact offense of his own like the piledriver, superplex, suicide dive to the outside, and even tactics like crotching Bulldog on the guardrail & holding the tights during a pin attempt as this match was also one of the rare times during this period of WWE (and Bret's career in general) where there was a heavy amount of blood as Bret was busted open & heavily bleeding after going face first in the steel steps on the floor.  While their match at SummerSlam is more memorable, I actually enjoyed this encounter better as they just flowed better here.

No Holds Barred Match: WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel - The buildup to this match was very unusual & different than what we've seen in WWE pre-Attitude Era as far as Diesel having a ""shoot"" persona where he openly acknowledged Vince McMahon as the owner instead of just the color commentator while threatening to come for him after the match based off his frustration of changing him into a ""corporate puppet"" while champion while Shawn was out for revenge for Diesel turning his back on him & attacking him with a chair.  HBK took the fight to Diesel right away showing his athleticism with a top rope moonsault to the outside while also showing he can get dirty too using a boot from the spanish announcer before Diesel took advantage of the match stipulation taking out anyone he felt got in his way & using weapons like a belt & chair while delivering to low blow before sending Shawn through the announce table that even Vince at ringside felt was going too far but both men continued to just use whatever they could get their hands on from a fire extinguisher, a chair, and something from wrestling legend Mad Dog Vachon at ringside that you have to see to believe.  I said this earlier in that this match was pre-Attitude Era & ECW was still not known to a national audience so it was rare to see this type of match using the weapons & punishment they gave each other during this time so this match was definitely a classic for it's time & still stands the test of time to this day.

WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind - Paul Bearer pushed a casket with Mankind inside of it before the match & you got the tone of what this match was going to be within the first few minutes when both men took it to the floor with Shawn stomping on the outside mat with Mankind underneath it, delivering a flying crossbody to the outside & whipping his head back onto the concrete floor. This match quickly evolved into a brawl with both men throwing fist & going back to the outside with Shawn targeting the leg after delivering a suplex that resulted in Mankind's leg slamming into the steps followed by driving the leg into the casket & various submissions. Mankind fought back working over Shawn in corner with two double axe handles in the Tree Of Woe but also took punishment as his knee once again ran into the steps, took a drop toe hold to the face, and his head wrapped between the ropes but still able to catch Shawn in the Mandible Claw which caused Shawn to focus on that hand as he attacked it using a chair multiple times & stomps. Both men traded momentum from here with both taking the punishment together such as a superplex through the outside table & Mankind getting a superkick to the face with a chair on the top rope before various associates got involved. Foley stated that this was the best match in his career in his first book, Shawn would later state that this was his favorite match during his first WWE Championship defense during the ""Boyhood Dream"" run, and various people claimed this to be the match of the year for 1996 as this was a standout encounter in both of their careers.

Steve Austin vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - Almost 3 years before the would have their more famous feud over the WWF Championship, they met here for the first time in a match due to Savio Vega's injury that made this a rare match at this time with two heels facing each other. Both men tried to intimidate each other with shoves & slaps including one slap that knocked the other guy down before wrestling a back & forth encounter. However the bigger issue here was Mr. Perfect, who was already scheduled to face Hunter the next night on RAW in his return match, coming down causing a distraction to Hunter but also ended up getting into a confrontation with Austin as well. This was a good match seeing how both men were heels at the time but was more about hyping up the match for RAW the next night & as a side note that if you know the storyline between Jim Ross & Vince McMahon at the time then you'll get a laugh at the commentary.

Buried Alive Match: Undertaker vs. Mankind - As usual when it came to whenever these two men fighting each other, this was a brawl that was hardcore before the word ""hardcore"" was ever used in WWF as they went all over the place from the ring to ringside & through the crowd down to the actual grave. They used everything they could get their hands on from microphone cords to a sharp object that Paul Bearer brought into the match. Other objects were used like Mankind giving Undertaker a chairshot before Taker would later use the chair to give a legdrop onto Mankind's face along with the steel steps being driven into Mankind's back & face. Just like Undertaker's later encounters like the Hell In A Cell vs. Shawn Michaels & the Inferno Match vs. Kane, this was a first for it's kind and something to watch from beginning to end and even after the match.

WWF Championship/Final Four Match: Bret Hart vs. Undertaker vs. Steve Austin vs. Vader - This was a very unique type of match in WWE history that was setup under unusual circumstances which we haven't seen since as Austin was eliminated in the 1997 Royal Rumble but the referees didn't see it causing Austin to come back in & eliminate the other 3 men to win the Rumble causing this setup to happen where they would all meet with elimination happened by pinfall or submission or going over the top rope with the winner now becoming the WWE Champion due to Shawn Michaels forfeiting the title earlier in the week.  This match was non-stop chaos from the opening bell as there was a moment where everyone fought each one of the other competitors at one time or another making for various highlights like Vader getting a chair & steps thrown into his face within' the opening moments causing him to wear the ""crimson mask"" throughout the entire match, anything they could get their hands on being used as a weapon including the guardrail & chair & steps & the title belt itself, fighting in & out the ring to the isleway & in the crowd, Steve Austin's non-stop obsession with Bret Hart, and everyone resorting to desperate tactics to win such as the amount of times Vader was on the receiving end of a low blow.  It was a unique match for it's time & would still stand the test of time today against most ""Fatal Four Way"" matches that have happened since but more importantly, this was the standout performance for Vader that hasn't been seen since his match with Shawn Michaels at SummerSlam months earlier.

Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust, Legion of Doom vs. Hart Foundation - The Hart Foundation returns home to Canada for this main event where they were received a hero's welcome from the crowd with members of the Hart Family sitting front row ringside.  This was a wild & emotional tag team match just based off the environment alone that had various highlights like Austin & Bret starting out, Austin constantly showing that he thought Canada was #1, Pillman mocking Shamrock & paying for it, Bulldog showcasing his power various times, the constant teamwork of the Hart Foundation including classic tag team moves from the original Foundation in Bret & Niedhart, Austin resorting to using a weapon to take out Owen Hart only for Bret to give a receipt, Pillman making an ass of himself at one point, all out brawling between both teams in & outside of the ring, and Austin trying to fight the entire Hart family.  This was a great tag team match from the action in & out of the ring to the hot crowd throughout the match to the emotional aftermath with all the Hart family in the ring together which Bret Hart has testified to himself saying it was the last time their entire family was united together.

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels - Although these two are most remembered for their later encounters like Hell In A Cell & Casket Matches, this was the rare forgotten first one-on-one match they ever had against each other. This was one of those crazy encounters that just started off wild & never stopped as Shawn was heavily trying to avoid & running away from Undertaker at all cost to the point where Taker got heavily impatient & threw the referee over the top rope onto Shawn. To steal a line from Steve Austin, Taker ""opened up a can of whoop-ass"" on Shawn Michaels from that point forward by beating him up the ramp, on the stage including a press slam that you just knew had to hurt, down the ramp to the point where Shawn was begging for the referee to stop the match but there was one problem...the match didn't even start yet. This match was just crazy from start to finish with Shawn heavily trying to rely on his partnerships with Triple H, Chyna, and Rick Rude while the referees kept getting abused & wrestlers had to come out from the back to try to separate these two before Taker delivered a ""highlight reel"" moment just to get more of Shawn.

Non-Sanctioned Match: Steven Austin, Owen Hart, Cactus Jack, Chainsaw Charlie vs. Triple H, New Age Outlaws, Savio Vega - This was originally set to be a preview of the upcoming WrestleMania with all four men having issues with members of the opposite teams but Shawn Michaels didn't participate due to injury causing Savio Vega to replace him.  You knew what direction this match was going in when all the members of Triple H's team came out with a weapon while Cactus & Chainsaw came out with a cart full of them as this match had close to 10 minutes worth of just out of control fighting with the weapons (too many to try to list) in & out of the ring while also delivering some harsh punishment like a two man powerbomb through open chairs & Austin launching a trash can from the apron to Billy Gunn in the ring that knocked him down on impact.  The match settled down for a bit with Triple H's team focusing on the older Chainsaw Charlie before things picked up again & got wild again such as Billy Gunn thrown into the corner where Road Dogg was underneath a piece of table, Cactus being covered in barbed wire, and unprotected chairshots.  This was definitely ""hardcore"" for it's time in WWE but stay tuned afterwords as you got quite the visual of who Austin gave the last stunner to.

WWE Tag Team Champions Mankind & Kane vs. Steve Austin & Undertaker - While this type of match setup has been done various times in recent years, this is the first time I remember it actually happening where the current singles champion is teaming with his future challenger to face the tag team champions as Austin & Undertaker were already set to meet at SummerSlam for the WWE Championship but had to team here against two men they've been having issues with for months in Kane & Mankind while everyone was unsure if Kane & Undertaker had an alliance together.  Undertaker had arrived to the building around a half hour before the match & went to confront Austin during his entrance in the isleway before Kane & Mankind attacked from behind bring the match to the ring as we saw that Austin & Taker kept having their issues against each other with both men giving each other the finger, having staredowns during the match, kept trying to fight both men by themselves, and not reaching for a tag when his partner was down while Kane & Mankind showed teamwork by working together, making multiple tags, and having the partner work on the opponent on the outside while the legal man had the referee distracted.  This was a good tag team match not only by the action inside the match but the story between the partners of Austin & Undertaker as well.

WWE Intercontinental Champion Ken Shamrock vs. Mankind - Mankind came into this match with his fingers taped up for the first time in a long time like how he used to when originally applying the mandible claw as Shamrock took control heavily working over his arm with an armbar takedown followed by various stretches like the hammerlock while being able to remain one step ahead of Mankind countering his offense including the mandible claw.  Mankind was able to get an advantage on the outside sending Shamrock into the steps but was able to regain the advantage when Mankind tried to interject a chair into the match while still working over the arm.  Mankind was able to finally start gaining some momentum with a double arm DDT, attacking Shamrock in the tree of woe, and his trademark Cactus Jack offense of a clothesline taking both of them over the top rope followed by the elbow off the apron but Shamrock was able to regain the advantage on the floor with a powerslam that send Mankind's legs into the steps.  This was a nice back & forth match.

The fight went to the stage & technical area where both men took hard falls like a DDT through a table & suplex on the concrete as they made their way back to ringside where he had a few comedic moments from The Rock on commentary to Mankind's ""Mr. Elbow"" & later some ""SmackDown Hotel"" before they got more violent using whatever was near them such as the announce table, chair, and the steps including one moment where Rock dropped the stairs out of the ring onto Mankind's knee on the outside causing Lawler to comment, ""It's getting out of hand now."" This match followed the formula of their previous matches in this feud (I Quit & Empty Arena) where it was a physical hardcore brawl where they beat each other until they had nothing left...literally.

Both started out trading fist with Austin getting the early advantage sending Bret into the outside steps & guardrail before briefly going into the crowd while Bret had to resort to tactics like using the referee & a chair to regain the advantage.

5529841,2,B00AZL304M,"I would be praising this Blu-Ray release, but explicably both the Shawn vs Diesel and the Bret vs Austin vs Taker vs Vader matches have been trimmed about a minute plus for each match. In both matches, the omissions involve a wrestler being strangled with a belt or cord. Why the WWE is afraid to show their matches uncut all of a sudden is beyond me! It's pro wrestling, guys, not kindergarten time! Vince should recall this release, restore the missing footage and offer a replacement for those who've already purchased it! Enough said!!!",1367366400,9,540,4.75531914893617
5529842,5,B00AZL304M,While I'm happy to see these ppv matches being released I wonder why the WWE doesn't release the entire PPVs in an anthology set? Todd Pentengail is a nice addition and should definitely bring some entertainment to this DVD.  I assume if this does well we will see another one but why not pay a little more for set of the PPVs in their entirety? In saying all this I look forward to the release.,1363478400,7,395,4.266666666666667
5529843,4,B00AZL304M,"In summary, In Your House was a series of pay-per-view (PPV) events that had filled in the ""gap"" months in the calendar year between the WWF's flagship PPV events: Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, King of the Ring, Summerslam and Survivor Series.

For a complete listing of matches you can find out on the link at WWE DVD News:
[...]

Strengths:
*It is nice to see that the WWE has released a set devoted exclusively to classic In Your House matches.
*Many of the matches have not been released on DVD or Blu-ray sets. This is a bonus because you do get more value for money especially if you have bought a lot of WWE home video releases before.

Weaknesses:
*My only critique is that condensing the history of In Your House to a 3-disc (DVD) or 2-disc (Blu-ray) release will inevitably omit a number of great matches.
*Personally, I would like to see a complete anthology of all nineteen In Your House PPV events in the same way the WWE has released anthologies of Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, Survivor Series and SummerSlam.

I would give this a 8.75/10 which is equivalent to a four star rating.",1363046400,8,1092,4.61340206185567

First off, I'm glad Todd Pettengill is hosting this set. I found him funny when he was doing the Pay Per View reports back in the 90's for every upcoming pay per view. He ran down the pay per view card and threw up some jokes whenever he saw fit to. I was wondering what happened to him since he left the then WWF and how he looks since then. Guess I'll find out now.

Disc 1

Simplistic Yet Brilliant

Bret Hart vs. Hakushi
In Your House * May 14, 1995 - This was a great match. They just gelled together despite their styles being different. The first match of the very first IYH pay per view. Great way to start the set of.

Intercontinental Championship Match
Jeff Jarrett vs. Shawn Michaels
In Your House * July 23, 1995 - It was a good match. I'm not denying that. But I'm just not a fan of Double J's work.

Hey Yo

Intercontinental Championship Match
Razor Ramon vs. Dean Douglas
In Your House * October 22, 1995 - I think Scott Hall, one of the sharpest minds of the business was brilliant as Razor Ramon. The Dean character didn't do Shane Douglas any favors. In fact, it's what may have led him back. THis wasn't a good match for me and shouldn't be on this set in my opinion. But I'm not gonna whine and complain about it being here.

Arkansas Hog Pen Match
Hunter Hearst Helmsley vs. Henry O. Godwinn
In Your House * December 17, 1995 - This DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT be on this set. IYH has had some great matches so they could have easily placed something worth watching over this.

A Sloppy Masterpiece?

WWE Championship Match
Bret Hart vs. British Bulldog
In Your House * December 17, 1995 - While I enjoyed their Summerslam 92 match better, this was still pretty good.

Disc 2

Memories Flooding Back

No Holds Barred Match for the WWE Championship
Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel
In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies * April 28, 1996 - Ah. This is the infamous match where Diesel used what was, I think a prosthetic leg if I remember right. I liked their WM11 match better for some reason. However, that doesn't mean this match was bad because it wasn't.

WWE Championship Match
Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind
In Your House: Mind Games * September 22, 1996 - One of the best matches of Foley's WWE career aside of course from his matches with HHH and The Undertaker.

That's Why They Play The Game

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley
In Your House: Buried Alive * October 20, 1996 - Nowhere near as good as their matches from 1999 to 2001. To be fair though, they're young here and have not yet reached main event status.

Buried Alive Match
The Undertaker vs. Mankind
In Your House: Buried Alive * October 20, 1996 - Loved it. I loved every match in the Taker/Mankind rivalry. I think this storied rivalry should be documented in a future Rivalries set with every match they had together included.

Crowning a New Champion

Four Corners Match for the Vacant WWE Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Bret Hart vs. Vader vs. The Undertaker
In Your House: Final Four * February 16, 1997 - I found Vader's bleeding a bit disturbing. Aside from that, this was a great, entertaining match between four of the best at that particular time. I remember being pissed that Taker didn't win even though he would have had it not been for Austin.

Disc 3

Back in the Saddle

10-Man Tag Team Match
The Hart Foundation vs. Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust & The Legion of Doom
In Your House: Canadian Stampede * July 6, 1997 - I am NOT a fan of these types of storylines/angles. I was able to get over that though to enjoy what I thought was a terrific main event match. I was surprised and the functioning of Austin and his team because they were able to get through the match.

Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker
Ground Zero: In Your House * September 7, 1997 - This only served as a prelude to the HIAC that would take place a moth later. Therefore that should be here in addition to or instead of this match

A Slobberknocker

Non-Sanctioned 8-Man Tag Team Match
Stone Cold Steven Austin, Owen Hart, Cactus Jack & Chainsaw Charlie vs. HHH, The New Age Outlaws & Savio Vega
No Way Out of Texas: In Your House * February 15, 1998 - If you wanna see a brawl between 8 men, this is for you. There were some important questions going into this like who would replace HBK, could Austin and Owen co-exist, could Austin's team members work with him and vice versa? This was an entertaining brawl to watch. The fact that it was non-sanctioned probably made it even better.

WWE Tag Team Championship Match
Stone Cold Steve Austin & The Undertaker vs. Mankind & Kane
Fully Loaded: In Your House * July 26, 1998 - Started off slow for me, which I didn't mind. But it picked up towards the end. Worthy of being the closing match of the night considering the talent involved.

Intercontinental Championship Match
Ken Shamrock vs. Mankind
Judgment Day: In Your House * October 18, 1998 - I wasn't really a Ken Shamrock fan. The only time I was into Shamrock's matches were when he was feuding with The Nation (Rock in particular and later Owen Hart) and when he was in matches that weren't your normal, ordinary singles matches. Like the Steel Cage match from Breakdown for instance.

Victory at All Costs

Last Man Standing Match for the WWE Championship
The Rock vs. Mankind
St. Valentine's Day Massacre * February 14, 1999 - Another great rivalry that should be on a Rivalries set. Great match here.

A Trip Down Memory Lane

Blu Ray Exclusives:

Disc 1

Todd Pettengill Outtakes - Doesn't need to be here.

In Your House Sweepstakes Winner - I think this was part of the first IYH where the winner won a house. Doesn't need to be here either if you ask me.

Those two could've been replaced with another match or an interview.

Disc 2

#1 Contenders Match
Bret Hart vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin
In Your House: Revenge of the `Taker * April 20, 1997 - Yet another rivalry deserving of a Rivalries set.

Match to crown first WWE Light Heavyweight Champion
Taka Michinoku vs. Brian Christopher
D-Generation X: In Your House * December 7, 1997 - I was a fan of Taka's work. i did enjoy this. But I liked his match with Christian at Judgment Day better.

WWE Championship Match
Shawn Michaels vs. Ken Shamrock
D-Generation X: In Your House * December 7, 1997 - HBK had better matches than this at IYH events.

D'Lo Brown vs. X-Pac
Fully Loaded: In Your House * July 26, 1998 - As great a contest as this was, fact is it could have been replaced and probably should have been in favor of others.

As you may have noticed in the title of this review, there's a question mark. I ask you, is this really the best of IYH? I don't think so because (1) There's things here that could have and should have been replaced and (2) There's some good stuff missing. WWE's compilation or Best Of releases are always hit or miss. Even if they are hits, they're still missing some good stuff.

Just some of what should've been the set:
HBK/Sid/Ahmed vs Cam Cornette - International Incident
Taker vs HBK - Badd Blood
Taker vs Goldust - Mind Games
Shamrock/Ahmed/DOA vs The Nation - No Way Out 98
Taker vs Kane - Unforgiven 98
Austin vs Dude Love - Over The Edge
HHH vs Rock - Fully Loaded 98
Edge vs Owen Hart - Breakdown 98
Taker vs Austin vs Kane - Breakdown 98
Taka vs Christian - Judgment Day 98
Taker vs Kama - Casket Match - a Dark match main event after one of the IYH shows ended. Forgot which one.",1360540800,5,7437,4.430249632892805
