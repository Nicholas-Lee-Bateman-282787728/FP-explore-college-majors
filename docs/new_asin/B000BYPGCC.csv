8094338,3,B000BYPGCC,"This wasn't bad. It had its moments, the tension between the protagonists (what does that word really mean anyway?) was basically fun. I didn't really buy the 'Hollywood' ending though. It was inevitably the only logical way it could end  and yet somehow it kind of ruined it. Liked it better when they were questioning and probing each other than falling head over heels in rapture. But that's what  movies like this are made for I guess.",1256169600,,439,4.688311688311688
8094339,4,B000BYPGCC,"Juliette Binoche and Jean Reno are the protagonists in ""Jet Lag,"" a melancholy and sad story about two people who fall in love through no fault of their own. They do everything to avoid it but ultimately cannot, due to the inevitability of fate and an over-riding sense of being in the right place at the right time (or the wrong place at the wrong time).

Binoche as Rose is a down on her luck Cosmetician who has decided to flee a bad relationship and fly to Acapulco and Reno is Felix , trying to fly to Munich to hook up with his supposed girl friend. Needless to say, neither makes it to their destination.

Director Daniele Thompson keeps it light and airy and banks on the screen personas of both Binoche and Reno to set the mood and tone of the film. Initially Reno looks at Binoche as an overly made-up bimbo while Binoche looks at Reno as an anal-retentive Bureaucrat. Both are right but come to realize that, though they are initially wrong for each other, are unavoidably, ultimately and cosmically destined to be with each other.

Binoche and Reno trade on their patented dramatic personas and turn in slyly comic performances that are psychologically true. ""Decalage Horaire"" (Jet Lag) is a story of what happens when two emotionally weary and frozen people are willing to let their guards down and allow Love to enter their lives. It's a story as old as time but nonetheless feels fresh here because of the truthfulness and emotionally emphatic performances of Binoche and Reno.",1141257600,5,1493,4.669201520912548
