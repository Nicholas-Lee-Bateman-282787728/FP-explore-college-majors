8076871,5,B000AABFZO,"A B-western ahead of its time. It provides a sympathetic view of the hundreds of broken treaties that the U.S. made with Native American tribes. Tim McCoy, a much better actor than given for is excellent in the role of the disillusioned calvaryman.",1523923200,,248,4.790697674418604

8076875,4,B000AABFZO,"""Lightning Carson Rides Again"" from Victory Pictures has overall ok quality, but suffers from 4-5 bad dialogue splices.  Running time is about a minute short of source times.  ""End of the Trail"" from Columbia Pictures is an absolute gem of a western.  The audio-video is very good with no splices.  The major problem with this feature is that the opening and ending title cards have been replaced by the re-issuer.  All references to Columbia Pictures have been removed.  Running times are all over the place.  It's a shame the way studios and re-issuers have shown a lack of respect for these works of art.  You can hear the music for the Columbia logo underneath the title card and it is very depressing not to be able to see that grand opening logo and the original titles.  Sony has only released one Tim McCoy feature DVD a few years back, and even that was a re-issue with all references to Columbia gone.  That can only lead me to believe that some of these original title sequences no longer exist.
UPDATE:  Amazon can't seem to tell the difference between Bob Steele and Tim McCoy when placing reviews, so I'm just going to add another review here(one review is beng put on two entirely different products).  I purchased a few of these VCI DVD-R westerns and although I like the films, I just wish they would use films they could get decent prints for.  The overall picture quality is ok, but the edits and dialogue splices are hard to take.  Tombstone Terror(1935) from Supreme Pictures has original credits, but during a barroom fight there is a strange sped-up voice talking for a few seconds.  It seems complete, but the reported running times are all over the place.  Lightnin' Crandall(1937) from Republic Pictures has dialogue splices, one of which looks like it was at a reel change and could be missing about 30-40 seconds, because it runs a minute short of the reported running time.",1355616000,3,1902,4.7009063444108765
