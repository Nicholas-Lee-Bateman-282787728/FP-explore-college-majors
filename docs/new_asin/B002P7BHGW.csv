8376689,5,B002P7BHGW,"Nasiruddin Shah beautifully portrayed the Delhi poet Ghalib from young manhood to old age (though the actor himself was not yet 40) in this 1988 television series. Each half-hour segment is tied to one of the 19th-century poets ghazals, which is sung as a finale. The settings look real: stained walls, carved balustrades, bustling markets and lush countryside. It must have been filmed mostly on location, giving it an authentic texture. Many scenes take place in Ghalibs cobblestone lane and two-story house. In financial straits, Ghalib is too proud to accept help from wealthy friends, but not too proud to borrow from every moneylender in town. And gamble  illegally. The British overthrow of the Mughal emperor ends the courtly poetry readings where he is finally welcomed, but Ghalib endures. Losses and disappointments give his poetry depth that the court poets couldn't attain. In the final episodes, his eyes are like burning coals surrounded by ashen beard and hair. Yes, the pace is stately, but its an opportunity to savor the visual richness and eloquent acting. It helped me to have some idea of who Ghalib was from reading about the 1857 uprising that ended the Mughal empire. Now I want to learn more about his work and life.",1493769600,,1242,4.971153846153846

8376694,3,B002P7BHGW,"This is fine for people who understand what they're looking at, but without subtitles and context, it moves SLLLOOWWWLY.

Too much work to look up the meanings of each ghazal on the internet.  I'd rather listen to a CD by Jagjit Singh.",1375142400,,235,4.571428571428571
8376695,5,B002P7BHGW,"I had seen this series on DVD a few years ago.  This new DVD is much improved.  The studio has cleaned up the video and reformatted it for widescreen.  There are subtitles in English.  The menu has been re-done and allows to to skip to Ghazals.  The Audio quality is pretty good for a TV serial produced in the mid eighties. If you are a Ghazal, Ghalib or Jagjit fan, you will love this DVD.",1322784000,2,391,4.16
8376696,5,B002P7BHGW,"If you are a fan of Urdu poetry, you will absolutely love this DVD set.  The original serial was produced on VCR tapes, back in the 90's and was a sheer joy to watch.  This DVD version further enhances the visual & aural pleasures.
A combination of Ghalib, Gulzar, Jagjit & Nasiruddin Shah has produced a masterpiece to be cherished for ever.",1321833600,3,342,4.5
