8484095,5,B005R3YYMU,"n underrated little masterpiece directed by Raoul Walsh. The acting, the dialogue look very, fresh, natural as if it was improvised on the set. As in many other films, Walsh directs splendidly the women, here Joan Bennet who is very lively. Her scenes with Spencer Tracy are wonderful",1529712000,,284,4.9375

8484097,5,B005R3YYMU,"This film stars Spencer Tracy and a lovely Joan Bennett. It was made by Fox Film prior to their takeover by Darryl Zanuck's 20th Century film company. I first saw this on a tape some one had made from a Fox Cable screening in the early 1990s. It was a fine print then and is a fine print in this DVD-R from Fox Classic Collection.
Much of Fox negatives and film printing materials were destroyed in a massive New Jersey vault fire in 1937. That quality prints have survived of many Fox titles from the depression period is a marvel.

Tracy is a cop on the waterfront complete with skid row types and a port cafe of the usual kind.

I enjoyed this film in the 1990s and enjoy it now. Worth having in my collection.",1398729600,6,713,4.235294117647059

8484100,4,B005R3YYMU,"Whenever I play Best Cinematic Pairings with my movie buff pals - usually on Thursday evenings - and the name of Spencer Tracy surfaces, Katharine Hepburn is usually the name people mention. And rightly so. But Spencer Tracy made four films with Joan Bennett, and their chemistry isn't to be sneezed at. Their most famous film together is probably FATHER OF THE BRIDE, but ME AND MY GAL - which came out in 1932 - showcases the pair at their most synergistic.

In the 1930s both Tracy and Bennett were contracted to Fox, a studio that kept them busy. In 1932 alone, Tracy did seven pictures and Bennett, six. Joan Bennett once mentioned that of the six films she did in 1932, ME AND MY GAL - not to be confused with Judy Garland and Gene Kelly's FOR ME AND MY GAL - is by far the most memorable. In it Tracy plays cocky Irish beat cop, Danny Dolan, who romances Bennett's wisecracking, gum-chewing lunch counter cashier Helen Riley. ME AND MY GAL was shot during the pre-Code era, and so the script drums up more salaciousness than you'd see two years hence. The melodrama comes courtesy of Helen's sister, Kate (Marion Burns), who'd just gotten married but still carries a torch for a hoodlum (George Walsh, the director's brother). When this bit of nogoodnik breaks out of stir, guess to whom he makes a beeline for shelter and more? Never mind that Kate's paraplegic father-in-law lives in the house, unable to communicate except by blinking in Morse code. Oh, it's lurid, brother. Someone fan me.

The dramatic bits aside, a strong boisterous comic streak courses thru the film. Tracy and Bennett's crackling interplay ranges from rapid-fire banter to poking fun at STRANGE INTERLUDE, a pretty pretentious flick. In STRANGE INTERLUDE, the characters' inner thoughts are heard in voiceover, and Tracy and Bennett gleefully imitate the gimmick in one sequence. ME AND MY GAL also doesn't shy away from breaking the fourth wall or from slapstick comedy, so if you enjoy seeing a man getting slapped in the face with a fish, then you are in luck. Spencer Tracy, as ever, is a natural on camera, bringing the toughness and the smarts and the compassion to his role. Admittedly, Joan Bennett isn't much on my radar most of the time. Word on her is that she flourished under the guidance of a good director, and not so much under an inferior or indifferent one. Raoul Walsh is very much a lively director, and he manages to coax a marvelous performance out of her. But don't take my word for it. Check out this early talkie treat. To borrow Danny Dolan's favorite word, it's ""jake!""
