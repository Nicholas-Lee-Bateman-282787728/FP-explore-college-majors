8650541,5,B00JFGADDO,"Just to clarify, this movie, Viy Vozvrashchenie or Viy the Return (2010), is not a remake of Viy or the Spirit of Evil (1967).  It is rather a sequel to the original movie, and, if I'm not mistaken, incorporates some of the footage from the original film.

The 1967 Viy is an excellent film and faithfully captures the original story from Nikolai Gogol's Mirgorod Collection. Although I am also a fan of Mario Bava's Black Sunday in all its versions, Bava's film departs significantly from Gogol.

The new movie, Viy the Return, also departs from Gogol, but consciously works to provide the viewer with an alternative explanation for the supernatural goings on.  As such, it builds upon the original 1967 movie, which is why I strongly recommend that you first purchase and watch the 1967 Viy on RUSCICO DVD.  Then watch Viy the Return.  I will not give out any spoilers.  Watch both movies.

Unfortunately, the Blu Disc/3D release of Viy the Return, which is still available, does not provide either English subtitles or an English voice-over.  This is a significant problem for a person whose familiarity with the Russian language is sadly lacking.  On the other hand, the DVD release of Viy the Return does have English subtitles.  But the DVD seems to have become unavailable at present.  Fortunately, you will not have to worry about these problems with the 1967 Viy on RUSCICO.

For those of you interested in soundtrack music, Viy the Return by Anton Garcia is available on a limited edition CD from Kronos Records KRONCD056.

Hopefully, the DVD of Viy the Return will be re-released soon.

UPDATE:  It appears that Viy the Return will be released on June 30, 2015 in DVD format under the title Forbidden Empire.  I'm unclear whether this new release will be 127 minutes long or 111 minutes.

Interestingly enough, there are already a great many reviews on line in Amazon, ranging from those who enjoy the movie to those who deplore it.  I will defer further comment until I see the Forbidden Empire version, except to say that I hope that a little knowledge of the background of the story may ameliorate some of the harsher criticism.",1435104000,,2142,4.787465940054496
