2258138,5,B0008D7EBM,"At a time in American history when people are so divided in our country I can't think of a better film to see. The point of this movie, set during the Civil War, is that American's may find themselves on different sides of an issue, but we are all still Americans and live lives of common decency. In this case, two best friends end up on different sides of the same war - literally shoot at each other at one point. Of course, this being a Hollywood film, eventually their friendship and Americanism wins over and they become united again - much like America did after the Civil War. This is an amazingly subtle and well done film that still resonates.",1148256000,,653,4.404958677685951
2258139,5,B0008D7EBM,"""'Hearts in Bondage' is a classic old movie that will never grow stale. Now that we have it on DVD, we have the best-ever feature film on the Civil War to give to our grandchildren. The scenes of conflicting emotions and loss of innocence are realistically depicted. Lew Ayres's direction is pure genius.""",1146528000,,305,4.773584905660377
8055793,3,B0008D7EBM,"A gentle love story woven around the looming Civil War and the eventual battle between  the Ironclads Merrimac and Monitor. You won't learn much about the Ironclads in this film. In fact, about the only thing you learn is that the Civil War set family members against each other. If you want more about the Ironclads, then there are several (well illustrated) good books around. This seems to be , unfortunately, the only film portraying the battle of the Ironclads.",1489017600,,466,4.825
8055794,5,B0008D7EBM,Another terrific old classic. I love all movies from the 1930's.,1476403200,,64,4.909090909090909
8055795,4,B0008D7EBM,"The description of the movie which I streamed via Amazon Prime lists running time as about an hour and thirty eight minutes.  It actually lasted about an hour and eleven minutes.
This is a decent movie from the point of view of entertainment, but do not rely on it for history.  For one thing, the movie refers to the C.S.S. Virginia as the Merrimac (sic).  The Virginia was built upon the remains of the U.S.S. Merrimack but the ship so constructed was named the C.S.S. Virginia.  Another thing is that Admiral Farragut had nothing to do with introducing Ericsson and Bushnell.  Also there was no attempt to board the Monitor during the Hampton Roads battle. There are too many more to list.
The special effects are surprisingly good, particularly for a movie made in 1936.  The scenes with the ships are very well done.",1461801600,,821,4.666666666666667
8055796,3,B0008D7EBM,"The world changing naval battle between the Monitor and Virginia (aka Merrimac) has received little attention on film. The Ted Turner 1991 version is not available. Some fleeting mention is made in various Civil War documentaries. Even when portrayed or mentioned, the CSS Virginia is almost always called the Merrimac, the name of the Union ship that was burned early in the war before being refloated and built out as an ironclad by the Confederates and rechristened the CSS Virginia. Absent other material, one is left with this 1930s black & white film who's only real claim to fame is that it was the only movie directed by a somewhat well known actor of the time, Lew Ayres. The general story line is somewhat accurate. The actual plot and film gives new meaning to taking poetic license. If you simply need to fill a gap in your Civil War film watching, give it a look. Otherwise, save the time and avoid being led down the path of historic inaccuracy.",1429833600,,959,4.680473372781065
8055797,3,B0008D7EBM,"I thought the topic was first rate, the battle between the ironclads Monitor and Virginia. Those battle scenes were great. The plot was also good, a love story in time of war but a lot of the acting was stiff. Also the historical facts are rather jumbled to fit the script. The main character seems to be the big hero. He is everywhere but he is fictional. James Dunn was good. Nice to see him sober instead of the besotted father in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.",1388793600,,459,4.287356321839081
8055798,2,B0008D7EBM,"Historically the creation of these two historic maritime vessels was interesting. The romatic and brother versus brother storyline, while probably a reality, was performed pretty hokie.  I think James Dunn was miscast for the role. Transistion between scenes was choppy; more like a theatrical play than a movie.",1361491200,,312,5.5
8055799,4,B0008D7EBM,"I recently had a surge of interest in the early 'iron-clad' ship technology and in searching around for information on the subject came upon this DVD of the old (1936) film entitled ""Hearts In Bondage"". This movie is a dramatization of the events surrounding the famous US Civil War naval battle between the early iron-clad vessels Monitor & Merrimack. The run time for the film is relatively short (approx. 60 minutes) and it moves right along - presenting the various elements of the plot in a framework of a romantic 'love story' that helps to emphasize some of the deep divisions to family life that the Civil War caused. Within this context the, relatively familiar, tale of the construction of the Confederate iron-clad ""Virgina' from the remains of the Union vessel Merrimack and the struggles that 'northern' inventor John Eriksson faced in getting his revolutionary design for the Monitor implemented are played out. The film climaxes with an excellent recreation of the famous battle of the first iron-clads at Hampton Roads - the model works and special effects are very effective, even by modern standards! I found this to be a very enjoyable viewing experience - with good print quality (B&W, of course) and an engaging cast and production values. Highly recommended!",1353974400,,1280,5.0424528301886795
8055800,5,B0008D7EBM,Hard to find this movie since it's pretty obscure and only for people interested in American History and the naval battle between the Monitor vs. Merrimac.,1285459200,,155,5.0
8055801,5,B0008D7EBM,"I found this an excellent choice.  Remastering is well done.  The film is delightful at times.  It is a fine example of a historic fims that captures a key point in our nation's history. Filming of the sea fighting between the Monitor and the Merrimac is as exciting as current naval battles.  Interchange between President Lincoln and the main characters are especially inciteful, especially as seen from the perspective of the current times in America.",1177200000,,454,5.013333333333334
8055802,5,B0008D7EBM,Heart's in Bondage is all about what happens when two brothers are forced to fight against each other. It's set during the civil war and one of them ends up fighting for the south and the other for the yankees. Of course the day comes when they have to meet in battle and get torn between their love of family and the ideals that they are fighting for. It's very moving and shows that just because a movie is about war doesn't mean it can't also be about feelings. This is a great little family film.,1154044800,,500,4.21875
