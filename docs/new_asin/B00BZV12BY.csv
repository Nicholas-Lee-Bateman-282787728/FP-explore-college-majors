8575951,5,B00BZV12BY,This DVD should be a prerequisite for anyone to watch BEFORE they strap an E collar on their dog!,1520121600,,97,4.157894736842105
8575952,3,B00BZV12BY,It's okay info. I don't think it worth the price,1438646400,4,48,3.9
8575953,1,B00BZV12BY,"Very boring and basically useless. The DVD consists largely of pieced together lectures on the principles of dog training. No offense,  but the star of the show is wearying to watch and listen to.  There is No step by step examples of how to use the electronic collar. Warned several times not to initiate the training (what training???) unless we were confident,  we finally sent our dog away to a Dogtra boot camp for two weeks. The trainer also trained us. It cost us $2,250 and was worth every penny. Michael Ellison's DVD is not worth a nickel let alone the $60 we dropped on it.",1422748800,7,584,4.490566037735849
8575954,4,B00BZV12BY,"I was hesitant about using an e collar, but after viewing this video I was given the information to effectively and safely use it on my GSD.  It uses positive reinforcement when training with the collar.  The instructor indicates all sides of the training.  It is a must see if you are looking for instruction to effectively and safely use an ecollar on your dog.",1397001600,6,363,4.553846153846154
8575955,5,B00BZV12BY,"I have been researching bout training dogs and this DVD is definitely one of the best I have seen. It will be helpful if you have basic dog training concepts, so I think you need to do a basic internet research before to go with this DVD. Watch it several times until you get the minor details about the method.",1380758400,8,311,4.2
