4492806,4,B004X8AIF2,"Cedar Rapids is a sweet, but never sappy, comedy from director Miguel Arteta, who specializes in small films, usually comedies, which are almost anti-Hollywood in the way they allow humor to come naturally from well-developed characters rather than contrived jokes. Like his previous efforts,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Girl/dp/B0000797IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Girl</a>&nbsp;and the underrated 2009 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Youth-in-Revolt/dp/B001NPD9PY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Youth in Revolt</a>, Arteta casts well-known actors against type and allows them to develop their characters while showing off previously unexplored sides of their acting range. Even with actors that are well-known to mainstream audiences, Cedar Rapids flew under the radar, quietly slipping in and out of theatres in early 2011 while mediocrity continued its reign at the box office.

Ed Helms plays Tim Lippe, an insurance agent for Brown Star Insurance in Brown Valley, Wisconsin. Tim is a simple and nave, but good-hearted man, completely out of touch with the modern world. He is ""pre-engaged"" to his seventh-grade teacher Macy Vanderhei (Sigourney Weaver) and is oblivious to the world outside of Brown Valley. After a co-worker dies under mysterious circumstances, Tim's boss, Bill Krogstad (Stephen Root), sends him to Cedar Rapids, Iowa to represent the agency and claim the prestigious Two Diamonds Award. Upon his arrival, Tim befriends fellow insurance agents Ronald Wilkes (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) and the hard-partying Dean Ziegler (John C. Reilly), while finding himself smitten with Joan (Anne Heche). Yielding both hilarious and heartfelt results, Tim is introduced to situations he never imagined he'd find in Brown Valley, Wisconsin.

Other familiar faces include Kurtwood Smith (as the ultra-religious president of the convention) and Rob Corddry (in a short, but amusing cameo). Probably the most light-hearted film Arteta has directed, some will still label it a ""dark comedy"" due to its willingness to disregard political correctness and develop characters truthfully. I've often thought of Arteta as ""Alexander Payne-lite"" as his distinct, off-beat style seems cut from the same stylistic cloth as the films of Alexander Payne. This similarity was never more apparent to me while watching Cedar Rapids and I was surprised to learn, when the credits rolled, that Payne and his frequent writing partner, Jim Taylor, are actually two of the film's producers. Arteta's direction and style lend a lot to the quality of the film, but that's not to diminish the influence of Phil Johnston's script, which made the 2009 Hollywood Blacklist of the best unproduced screenplays. The script is a marvel in the way it features strong, funny, and deeply human characters with only a so-so story to push them forward. There's nothing particularly bad about the script, it's just a fairly straight-forward story that reaches a fairly standard conclusion. This small criticism aside, it's still more touching and clever than any comedy I've seen this year.

One must give credit to the terrific cast for frequently elevating the quality of the material. Helms doesn't get the chance to expand his range very much with Tim, but he does offer another side of the introverted, passive, and awkward character he's made his name playing before. Whitlock Jr. almost steals the show with his performance as Ronald, possibly being the only actor (or person even) who can elicit a laugh from saying ""The HBO series `The Wire.'"" Heche does a nice turn with her role, as does Weaver, who brings more class and humor to her small role than most actresses would have. There is a lot of talent in front of the camera, but Reilly's performance alone is enough for me to recommend the film. Loud, rude and hilariously funny, Reilly brings enough comedic energy, heart, and colorful use of the English language to make a separate film.

Cedar Rapids is an intelligent, low-key film that quietly sneaks up on you and charms with an equal amount of heart and wit. It's much more satisfying and genuinely funny than a large percentage of Hollywood comedies being pushed into local cinemas each week and it boasts a terrific cast doing some fantastic, dynamic work.  It fits more heart and humor into its 87-minute running time than most big comedies do with more than twice that.

4492807,5,B004X8AIF2,"I've been an Ed Helms fan for awhile and have wanted to see this for some time. I can say it does not disappoint. What a strong cast too with John C. Reilly and Anne Heche. Along with others that really bring it all together. I wouldn't call it a full out whacky silly movie. It's got this ""indy"" feel to it with just a great balance of comedy and things many can relate to. If you like those badly written mainstream comedies then this may not be for you but for those that like some ""indy"" in your movie then you can't go wrong.",1306540800,22,530,4.057142857142857
4492808,3,B004X8AIF2,"This movie was not nearly as good as I thought it was going to be.  There were definitely funny parts, but overall a big letdown.",1306281600,2,129,4.16
4492809,2,B004X8AIF2,"Apparently I am in the minorty on this one, but I saw nothing redeeming about this faux comedy.  There were a couple of moments I chuckled but it was really out of a desperation to be entertained and get my $5.50 worth.  Unfortunately this one fails miserably.  Ed Helms just can't carry the lead in this formula ""fish out of water"" comedy.  This flick tries desperately to be like ""40 Year Old Virgin"" but it falls very short of that lofty goal.  Maybe Steve Carell would have been better in the lead.  Who knows.  Anne Heche's character is a twit and she phoned in the role, but doesn't she always.  Even one of my favorites, John C. Reilly, couldn't save this one.  It is 87 miutes but it seems like three hours.  Don't be fooled by the mind numbingly stupid zombies giving this one overly positive reviews.  It is a terrible flick.  Two stars is my kind rating for a couple of accidental and momentary bursts of comedy.  Rent if you must.",1300060800,3,942,4.406976744186046
4492810,5,B004X8AIF2,"What a lovely movie. Well acted, suberbly directed. and for once the character transformation ( from innocent geek to crack smoking party animal) actually makes sense and flows logically. kudos to screenwriter but most importantly to director Miguel Arteta for making it happen.
and as always john C. Reilly totally steals the movie. There HAS to an Acadamy award nomination in that performance!!",1299715200,,396,5.301587301587301
4492811,4,B004X8AIF2,"Cedar Rapids looked like the type of comedy that could go either way. The trailer seemed to hint at Ed Helms channeling his Stu Price character from The Hangover. In fact, that was my initial thought process going in; that Cedar Rapids would probably be an extension of Helms' character in The Hangover. Other than the trailer being attached to one film before a screening, I've never seen the film advertised anywhere else as most haven't seen anything relating to the film at all. Luckily, the film was able to offer a little more than what it let on and actually turned out to be a rather solid R-rated comedy.

This shouldn't be a downright comparison between The Hangover and Cedar Rapids though; no matter how blatant it may seem. There is very little in common between the two films other than Ed Helms starring in both films and the crazy occurrences that can transpire under the influence of alcohol (in addition to some sort of hallucinogen, as well). Cedar Rapids is a comedy that is driven by Ed Helms' dorky yet alluring charm.

The cast is easily the film's most valuable asset as the scenes featuring all of the main cast are the most hilarious and the most memorable. Other than Ed Helms nerding it up to perfection, John C. Reilly almost steals the show as the loyal sex-hound Dean Ziggler. This also may be the best Anne Heche has looked in any film she's been a part of. The Cedar Rapids yearly ASMI convention being her character's only means of escaping the redundancy of everyday family life added a bit of depth to her character and made what would otherwise be scandalous actions a little more meaningful. Heche's real charm comes out in the scenes she shares with Helms. Their relationship is one of the driving factors of the film. Isiah Whitlock Jr plays Ronald Wilkes, a man who takes his job as an insurance salesman incredibly seriously but who also lets his dry humor and constant admiration of ""the HBO program The Wire"" shine at the best of times. Sigourney Weaver's character seemed to catch me off guard. Mostly because when you think of Weaver, you think of Aliens, Ghostbusters, or Avatar. In Cedar Rapids, she plays an on the prowl cougar who teaches and is just looking for a good time. So much for typecasting, eh? Stephen Root, Kurtwood Smith, and Alia Shawkat all have their moments, as well.

Cedar Rapids does have an indie feel to it though, which is probably a fair assessment to make since the film's budget was only $8 million. Cedar Rapids has a Little Miss Sunshine kind of atmosphere to it. Not so much in tone, but more of the way it was filmed. It could be a turn-off for some viewers who aren't fans of movies with small budgets.

Cedar Rapids is easily the funniest film to be released in 2011 so far. The entire cast plays off of each other in the best of ways and even some of the smaller roles given to more recognizable stars are pivotal to the laughs in the film. Unpredictable at times and extremely over the top at others, Cedar Rapids is definitely worth a watch if you enjoy R-rated comedies or films similar to The Hangover or Little Miss Sunshine.",1299196800,,3113,4.56350626118068
4492812,5,B004X8AIF2,"Tim Lippe is your average stereotyped inexperienced adult-in all corners of life. He has never left his isolated childhood community, has never stayed at a Hotel, is not a big drinker, believes intensely in monogamy-when his lover doesn't, and carries around the concept of ""pre-engagement."" Tim Lippe seems to have aged over night, from a teenager to a thirty year old man ; not unlike Tom Hanks in Big. The world of Cedar Rapids with its colorful characters is alien to Tim, and in his short stay he has to adapt to a lot of action.

Tim is an insurance agent from a ""two diamond"" trophy agency dispatched to Cedar Rapids for an insurance convention to bring back another ""two diamond"" trophies. He is partnered, unsurprising of these comedies, with people of extremely varied characteristics: the whitest black guy, Ronald Wilkes , the most obnoxious, outgoing drunk, Dean Ziegler, and a very humorous, sexually attractive woman, Joan. Ronald and Tim are conservative in behavior and humor, while Dean and Joan are firecrackers of light bolting energy. These four and countless others are vying for the trophies that would bring their agencies glory and profit.

The film brilliantly, and bravely, shows that for most this is a vacation. Dean and Joan are here to just escape life and family. Dean is recently divorced, and Joan has used this event every year for the opportunity to be with men that are not mentioned in her marriage license. The other two want this prize, for they are younger and possibly more ambitious, and have not experienced the monotonous cycle of life. This is visible when Tim explains to Joan his inspirational reason for becoming a insurance salesman which reeks of the inexperience of the dirty politics of the business. What Tim doesn't know is that she knows the underlying truth behind his tale. Additionally, the directors makes this convention and Cedar Rapids, in general, seem very slutty, a perfect theme for a comedy of this sort. From drugs, to prostitutes, not a minute passes that we sense that these people are stressed to win this prize. Even the most dedicated spend their time drinking and celebrating possibly the easiest week of their lives-and still probably getting a promotion or raise if they win the prize.

This kind of sexually provocative dialogue is nothing new, after the arrival of hits like Knocked Up and Superbad, but its refreshing to see it aimed at people in their thirties rather than their teens. These people can be vile, stupid, overtly sexual, profane, and impolite-teenagers are not alone in these characteristics. Tim Lippe, as a character, also works because he and everyone else is out of the bullying age of adolescence, for his juvenile and age-inappropriate behavior-which some would label as unmanly-would just not fly in front of a college girlfriend or casual friends. He would be teased, mocked, and deserted. These people identify with Tim, and offer him support about his relationship, and decisions he has to make about attaining the trophy and defying his boss. Juvenile dialogue is rampant throughout-especially after the credits role-but the characters are blossomed adults who treat each other with dignity and respect, at least most of the times.

The acting is top notch, especially from John C. Reilly who offers a great comedic performance that is similar in tone to Will Farrel's acting roles. I believe, based on the budget, that Reilly may have lowered his price for the role, and props to him for that.  The surprise though is Anne Heche who give a multi-layered performance that I was not expecting, making us like her flawed, unguarded character. Isiah J. Washington's role is minimal in tone, not displaying the vast emotions of Joan and Dean, nor the pre-adolescent heartbreaks of Tim. Just watch out for his textbook incorporation of HBO's The Wire which is done without irony.

Great comedy is often more difficult to accomplish than great drama, evidenced by the end of year best film lists. Mainly because comedies rarely try to enlighten or educate-they just want to entertain. This film accomplishes that with a level of adolescent themes and juvenile humor that is rare for many mainstream comedies-mainly because they are centered on youths. Cedar Rapids is far from perfect, nor is it very memorable. Yet, it tries to be neither, and is content with pleasing the masses for two hours of a weekend.",1298419200,4,4409,4.975576662143826
4492813,5,B004X8AIF2,"A straight-laced insurance salesman is sent to a retreat and tasked with maintaining his company's status as winner of a ""Two Diamond"" trophy. He encounters a number of people who bring him into a weekend of debauchery.  This film contains just enough raunchy humor to make it funny while the relatable characters will appeal to those who eschew the adult comedy common in today's films. The audience was laughing throughout the entire movie, and the film contained a degree of interplay among the characters that makes them engaging and likeable.",1298246400,,547,5.0777777777777775
4492814,4,B004X8AIF2,"In watching ""The Hangover,"" I thought to myself, ""One of the main characters shows some meat, but I wish they all had.""  This movie, full of non-rainbow flag characters, showed three males nude and none of the other gender.  Go figure.

There's something I like about Ed Helms.  Least important, he looks practically like two different men with or without his eyeglasses.  He has that innocent, loveable (sp?) vibe that Seth Rogen does.  Not only does he have chest hair, but it covers his pecks all the way past his navel.  If you like nerdy guys with hairy chests, then you will love all the flesh he shows here, including his backside.  He has that same cuteness that Rick Moranis had, but wasn't really able to cash in on.  Don't get me wrong: he doesn't have a curvy, perfect, monstah-booty like Ving Rhames, but it's still worth seeing and appreciating.

This work was an examination of hypocrisy, particularly from the highly religious.  If you can't stand holier-than-thou types, then you may appreciate this meditation.  However, some churchy people may be rubbed the wrong way by it.

It was hard for me to buy that Ed's character was such a novice.  I am fully aware that many of us Americans are very geographically immobile.  However, I doubt anyone would see a trip to Cedar Rapids as akin to visiting NYC.  He flies from WI to IA and I imagine that most WI residents would just drive their cars there.  The main character is supposed to be out of it, but yet he uses fancy laptop computers and smart phones.  Those tools are supposed to make the world smaller.  Yes, WI is terribly un-diverse, but I'm quite sure every WI resident has met a Black person before, which Ed's character hadn't.

In the trailer for the film, I didn't recognize the token female buddy of the troupe.  It turns out to be Anne Heche.  Since she dissed Ellen, I've lost respect for her, so I wasn't happy to see her in a major role again.  However, they have her in Julianne Moore drag.  I somehow think the casting department knew that she's lost many points with some moviegoers.  I don't see why one of the women from Judd Apatow's films wasn't chosen instead.  John C. Reilly seemed fatter here than usual and I wonder if he purposely gained weight for the role, btw.

The four characters are supposed to be a motley crew, but they were more like Culture Club.  The Black character plays against type (thankfully).  However, the fact that this film revolves around an extroverted white man, an introverted white man, a Black person, and a woman was tacitly PC.  But I still basically applaud it as being diverse and multi-culty.  Nevertheless, putting on my feminist hat, there is a way in which the woman was not deemed one of the Three Musketeers.  The men make a commercial near the end in which it's implied that she is their secretary.  However, through the film, she was positioned as having as much insurance experience as the guys.

For those of us who almost never travel on the job or attend annual events, this may be novel.  However, I do get the sense that annual events like these are where many people find themselves or get yanked out of their comfort zones.  I get the sense that rainbow-flag bear retreats may be as cathartic as this insurance conference was to the main characters.  Perhaps, the convention movie will take over the space of the roadtrip film.

I had to travel FAR to see this movie.  As I left the theater, I was looking forward to when this film would play closer to home and when it would be on DVD.  Clearly, this film won't ever be as popular as ""The Hangover,"" but it's a gem in its own surprising way.",1298160000,,3637,4.552469135802469
4492815,3,B004X8AIF2,"Cedar Rapids is a decent 90-minute getaway comedy for not having to think too hard, and full of quirky ""low-brow"" laughs.  Although this same director made somewhat darker films ""The Good Girl"" and ""Chuck & Buck,"" Cedar Rapids doesn't necessarily have the same cerebral feel as those films.  ""Rapids"" stars Ed Helms (The Office's ""Andy"") as insurance agent ""Tim Lippe,"" with a supporting cast of John C. Reilly, Sigourney Weaver, and Anne Heche.  Although the plot makes an attempt for original and quirky subject matter, it is ultimately pretty ""low-brow"" humor and is similar to other recent John C. Reily comedies and those like ""the 40-year-old Virgin.""

Helms' character is similar to his on ""Office"" in terms of his heart and enthusiasm - but Helm's character here is also an extremely ""wide-eyed"" and naive character from a small-town (e.g. has never been on a plane before or travelled far from home, believes in good-old-fashioned values, is intimidated by women, and of course believes strongly in the inherent integrity of his work and his fellow insurance agents).  As the movie begins, circumstances contrive to put all the pressure on ""Lippe"" to deliver THE BIG PRESENTATION at the BIG out-of-town Insurance Convention and thereby continue the string of awards and prestige for his local agency(but exactly to what end!??).

As implied, there's a lot of the funny crude humor full of sex jokes and Reiley's fast-taking satire about life and at the expense of others (there's also perhaps a bit too large proportion of middle-aged white guys wearing nothing but towels...but again that's all part of the humor). ""Rapids"" features a pretty strong cast and good comedic performances - in addition to Helms, Reiley, Hesch, Weaver, it's full of other faces one will recognize from various TV and movies.  While not a Farley Brothers Movie (""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""Kingpin,"" ""Something about Mary"") Cedar Rapids seems somewhat influenced by their type of movies in that it provides the characters with possibly life-changing quandaries, and makes an attempt at having genuine ""heart.""  I wouldn't call the humor extremely original - it's more full of small chuckles than non-stop huge guffaws.  Perhaps what sets it apart is a somewhat quirky subject matter as well as the ""all-for-one & one-for-all"" bond that develops among the main characters (all of whom are a bit ""down on their luck"" in life).  Also props for keeping it to a somewhat short & sweet at 90 minutes - with a few added ""out-take"" type scenes while the credits role.

C.R.'s ultimately a well-cast and amusing comedy.",1298160000,4,2589,5.053990610328638

4492866,4,B004X8AIF2,"I really hate all these dry office comedies that are common place today. Films like Office Space and shows like The Office and Community, make me wonder if the people who watch this stuff are truly brain dead to what real comedy is anymore. I assumed that Cedar Rapids would be another of these films, but there is a difference, Ed Helms. Even before he was in films like the Hangover, I thought this guy was hilarious, and I am a great admirer of his work, so I gave this film a shot. Helms plays Tim Lippy, an insurance agent who went right from High School to being an insurance agent. He has never been anywhere, never done anything, and is completely oblivious to the world outside his office. That all changes when Tim is sent to represent his firm at a Midwest insurance conference in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Alone and exposed for the first time in his life, Tim has a hard time just fitting in an letting loose, so he does what every insurance agent does, and turns to drugs, alcohol, and prostitutes. Cedar Rapids is the second film from Miguel Arteta, whose first film, Youth In Revolt, also surprised me. Neither of these films are the type of comedy I enjoy, but somehow Arteta has the magic touch. Cedar Rapids had me laughing to the point of tears, something that almost never happens, and for once, I saw how these ordinary, everyday situations could be funny. As for the star, Ed Helms, he was just amazing, his extreme anxiety and taking every emotion to it's absolute extreme just gets me every time. Cedar Rapids isn't your typical comedy and even after seeing the preview, I was convinced that it would be terrible, but the combination of Miguel Arteta and Ed Helms make this film a must see comedy classic.",1437264000,,1723,4.5256410256410255

4492879,2,B004X8AIF2,"Maybe I'm losing my sense of humor, but this seems like an immense waste of talent.  It seems to be aimed at 14-year-old males, to whom the idea of sex, drugs, and booze is still kind of fascinating, but the movie has an ""R"" rating, so the target audience probably didn't see it when it came out.  It is a seriously juvenile piece of work, with a protagonist who is himself (although he seems to be well into his thirties) a bit juvenile and for whom sex, drugs, and booze (not to mention air travel) seem fascinating.  He's Tim Lippe (Ed Helms), an insurance salesman from Wisconsin, tasked with going down to a regional convention in Sin City -- Cedar Rapids to you -- and bringing back the Best Agency award for his agency. He's an innocent abroad and about as interesting as watching paint dry.  He falls in with a motley crew of insurance agents who in effect undertake to educate him in the ways of the world.  But there's a Big Moral Issue:  it turns out that the sanctimonious head of the group that is making the award  (Kurtwood Smith) -- he likes to equate the insurance business and Christianity -- is a hypocrite: he will accept money for the bestowal of the award.  In order to give him his comeuppance, Tim and his new raunchy friends (John C. Reilly, Anne Heche, and Isiah Whitlock Jr) expose the scam publicly, thus showing that they really are good at heart, despite their casual attitudes to binge drinking, adultery, and drug-taking.  After all, hypocrisy just cannot be allowed to stand!

There's a really immature sentimentality about all this.  Adults behaving in ways that are not fully grown-up, and yet making claims on our approval because -- you know -- their hearts are in the right place.  It just won't do.  In movies, I can take racy language, sex, and the rest with the best of them, but I can't take the fakery, and these just aren't real people.  The director, Miguel Arteta, did a lot better with ""The Good Girl"" about a decade before this one.  Let's hope he gets his mojo back.  And Alexander Payne gets a Producer's credit?  Why would the maker of ""Nebraska"" want anything to do with this?",1423785600,,2128,4.528795811518324

Ed Helms does a very nice job as a tremendously innocent insurance salesman from a small town in Wisconsin, sent to a  convention in Cedar Rapids.  This represents his first time on a plane, his first time in the big city.  But while the film may tease Tim a little, it doesnt treat him with the removed, hip irony most films now would, and makes him a complex character (e.g. back home he has a fun sexual fling going with his 7th grade teacher, wonderfully played by Sigourney Weaver.  He may be an innocent, but hes also a grown man with a sense of humor and self.).  This ability to both kid and embrace characters is a long-time strength of director Miguel Arteta and producer Alexander Payne.

With some terrific support from John C. Reilly as a wild-man partier at the convention (who has more humanity than youd think),  Isaiah Whitlock Jr. as a straight-laced black room-mate (who has more humor, and more of a sense of fun than you might think), and Anne Heche as a party girl (who is smarter and more soulful than you might think).

1. Specific setting. You are in the foreign land of Midwest America! Rust! Christianity! Wood siding! Davenports and indoor pools!

2. Great casting. Every role in this flick is well cast. I heard a director say in some commentary: ""find the funniest actor you can, no matter how small the role."" Mike Birbiglia makes me giggle every time as the front desk clerk.

3. Great writing. The kind where the jokes hit over and over again. I reincorporated many a term into my daily diction because of this movie: ""just razzing,"" ""rigamarole,"" ""peccadilloes,"" ""you want a nipple on that?""

4. Can be enjoyed alone or with people that don't suck. It's a hangover movie. Water, coffee, beer s***s, nutrition, laughs- hopefully you'll be able to make something of your day.

5. It's formulaic - I guess this is the Hero's Tale at a midwestern work conference. Great peril! Zero tax on your brain.

The cast members seem a strange mix of ingredients in a rather potent cocktail.  They are people I wouldn't expect cast together who just really bring out great nuances all around.

4492940,2,B004X8AIF2,"The ""Cedar Rapids"" storyline was good enough to maintain interest,
provided one ignored over-the-top performances and a tendency to drift
towards being a dreaded Hollywood ""LAFF RIOT"".

Tim Lippe (played by Ed Helms) seemed miscast and was one of the worst
offenders. With Sigourney Weaver as a prime example in ""Snow Cake,""
many actors see being drunk, mad or under the influence of drugs as an
excuse to depict all three types of behaviour, at the same time, and
more of their own invention thrown in - without restraint. In short,
""anything goes"".

In this vein, Tim Lippe was able to wheel in
predicably unrestrained impressions of being over-pious,
tongue-tied, retarded, autistic, childlike, extraverted, introverted,
chaste and sex-crazed as the whim took him.

I don't actually agree with criticisms elswhere that the  script was ""lazy,"" (apart from its over-use of foul language)but I'd certainly criticise the movie's various sub-plots for being extremely lazy.

The themes of over ""religious"" people being hypocrites, prostitutes
having hearts of gold, paragons of virtue being led astray and
supposedly comic characters getting ""high"" are totally ""Lazy"" and have
been absolutely done to death in low-grade comedy.

4492944,4,B004X8AIF2,"This movie is just... under-rated. I don't think it caused much buzz at the box office - not necessarily a bad thing. I guess these off-kilter comedies that rely on 'sophisticated irony' (yeah, bet you never thought you'd see THOSE two words together) tend to be overlooked in favour of simplistic slapstick.

But hey, why am I bothering? Isn't it really worth a 1 star? I mean at first it feels like a b-grade comedy with desperate jokes that fall flat on their face, and kinda one-dimensional characters who either are stiff nerds or who just belch, fart and swear? Well, so it seems.

But with closer inspection, Cedar Rapids delivers the goods... and then some. Tim Lippe is one of this most hilarious send-ups of a social mal-adjust you'll ever see, and his on-screen chemistry with Dean Ziegler (John C Reilly) produces fireworks.

Yet, in a subtle, almost invisible way the film is actually quite moving. The characters are far deeper than they at first appear, and this film is a deep analysis of human understanding of right and wrong, with an uproariously funny main plot.

4492945,2,B004X8AIF2,"Cedar Rapids isn't an unfunny movie - or at least, it has its moments.  And for the first two-thirds, it sets itself up as an understated comedy, with all concerned - expecially John C. Reilly - ably handling their acting chores while the film follows the formula of small-town, aw-shucks guy Tim Lippe (Ed Helms) who gets overwhelmed by the fast women and loose morality in the big city...of Cedar Rapids.  The irony is, of course, that Cedar Rapids, even as the second largest city in Iowa, is still perceived as the epitome of small town, flyover country America - I know, I live practically around the corner from it.

So when a fluke accident enables Tim to represent the home office at a convention of regional insurance providers, he falls in with a group of veteran conventioneers who steer him through the sticky wickets of competition for the coveted 'Two-Diamond' award for the best agency.  Like many films of this sort, Tim's sheltered life has produced a rather rigid code of behavior which is at first repelled by the wild antics of his fellows - who are of the mind that what happens in Cedar Rapids, stays in Cedar Rapids - though slowly his reticence at joining in breaks down.  So far, so good - up to this point, the film is good-natured and innocuous.

Other films I've seen that pursue this same pattern - especially those from the late sixties through the eighties - often had a moment in the film where the aw-shucks character completely breaks from his puritan upbringing and loses control.  Some temptation proves too much for him to resist, and for better or worse, he is awakened to the dubious charms of the big city.  Sex and drugs are usually the culprit - and it seemed to me ganja was often the drug of choice.  CEDAR RAPIDS follows this general drift, but to my mind, it takes a spectacularly unfunny turn as Tim finds himself on a meth-fueled romp after seriously bruising his ethics during the convention's award competition.

Meth use seems to me to be such an unmitigated disaster that I just can't find anything funny about it.  CEDAR RAPIDS doesn't exactly glorify its use, but there's enough of a mixed message here that I felt extremely uncomfortable with those scenes.  Even without them, CEDAR RAPIDS ends up as only average - it seemed at any moment a really funny movie was trying to break out, but it never quite made it.  Instead, it ends up more as a character study, but without enough heft behind it to make it truly moving.  Average, yet with a full star deducted for the ambiguous drug use.",1335484800,,2543,4.609756097560975

Never been to a convention like the one portrayed in CEDAR RAPIDS.  But I'll darn sure keep looking.  The beauty of this indie comedy is the characters; I KNOW people like Tim Lippe (Ed Helms), Bill Krogstadt (Stephen Root), and yes, Dean Ziegler (John C. Reilly).  To identify with characters you already know creates instant recognition and soothing comfort; the viewer is firmly on board, ready to watch wet-behind-the-ears Tim go on an hysterical journey of self discovery. . .at an insurance convention. . .in Cedar Rapids.

I can't help but grin while typing the above sentence.

A comedy like CEDAR RAPIDS has very little wiggle room.  Either it meshes and works, or it rapidly dissolves into lame pizza supreme.  Fortunately, this little jewel works, because the cast is believable and likable and real--from taking a drunken dip in the hotel pool, to making up a Christmas song about policyholder surplus.  I've seen gung ho folks do likewise; heck, I've partied with several extroverted, rowdy, and raunchy Dean Zieglers.  (Been tempted by one or two Joan Ostrowskis; Anne Heche works handsomely on the old eyeball.)  This is one hysterical romp as Tim's innocent eyes are opened, new lifelong relationships are established, and all the while a subliminal angst is remedied.  It's physical comedy with a cerebral component, boasting an energetic, feel-good ending; CEDAR RAPIDS is a convention we all benefit from.

Ed Helms plays Tim Lippe, an insurance agent for Brown Star Insurance in Brown Valley, Wisconsin. Tim is a bit of a dork.  He is the epitome of being a nice guy without having a bit of polish or pizazz about himself.  He unexpectedly finds himself being sent by his company to the ""big city"" for an insurance event.  This big city is Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  There he meets a motley crew of other agents who succeed in loosening him up some.  Chief among these is the the wonderful actor John C. Reilley, who personifies every stereotype about insurance agents imaginable.  He is hilarious. Close behind him is Isiah Whitlock Jr. playing a black insurance agent who spends most of his free time doing community theater. Anne Heche rounds out the trio by being a femme fatal married insurance agent who is always on the make at these out of town conventions. Presiding over this annual event is Kurtwood Smith as the ultra-religious president of the convention whom Reilley constantly assails for besmirching insurance with religion (one of this best comedic bits).

All in all, a very enjoyable movie which deserves a wider audience than it got in the theaters.  I recommend you give it a try.

Rating: 2.5

It's probably no coincidence that Alexander Payne, one of the producers of the new quirky farce, 'Cedar Rapids', chose to support such a project, as there are a number of parallels with his 2002 quirky comedy, 'About Schmidt', starring Jack Nicholson. Both films have protagonists who work in the insurance industry. Schmidt is an insurance actuary and Ed Helms, who plays Tim Lippe in 'Cedar Rapids', is an insurance agent. Both films are set in the Midwest with 'Schmidt' set in Omaha, Nebraska and 'Cedar Rapids' in Iowa.

Director Miguel Arteta improves on the smugness of Payne's Schmidt character by making his Tim Lippe protagonist much more likable. Even the principal antagonist of the piece, President Helgesson (played by the always solid Kurtwood Smith) hardly seems offensive at all (just about the worst thing he does is take a $1500 bribe from Tim). As usually is the case with these quirky indie comedies or farces, the quirky protagonist must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo. Here, Tim partners with his lovable loser insurance agents, and thwarts his greedy boss who plans to sell Tim's Blue Diamond Insurance Company (another example of a conservative group getting their comeuppance at the hands of a quirky outsider are the beauty pageant officials in 'Little Miss Sunshine').

'Cedar Rapids' can be viewed as a farcical variation on the classic 'buddy' picture, 'The Wizard of Oz'. Ed Helms plays the 'Dorothy' character whose life is thrown in disarray when he's sent on an assignment to Cedar Rapids, to ensure that his insurance company wins the prized 'Two Diamond Award' for a third year in a row. Ultimately he seeks to return home restored to a state of equilibrium after visiting Cedar Rapids, an 'Emerald City' which he is dazzled by (Nerdy and nave Tim has never even seen a card key to open a hotel door). Along the way, Tim meets three allies who aid him in his quest, similar to the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion from 'Oz'.

Tim needs someone with some 'brains' to overcome his childish infatuations. When he's dumped by Macy, the older girlfriend played by Sigourney Weaver, Anne Heche, adopting the Scarecrow role as bold housewife Joan, appeals to Tim's intellect and manages to help him reflect on his behavior, and actually calm him down to the point where he's able to function more like an adult.

Isiah Whitlock as Ronald Wilkes, is similar to the Tin Man, as he ultimately turns out to have a big heart. Wilkes saves Tim after he's knocked down and assaulted at the party, an 'inmost cave' where the group battles dark forces (in terms of 'Oz', the Wicked Witch's castle comes to mind). Whitlock has his best scene in the film when he pretends to be a bad-ass from the ghetto, as opposed to revealing his true demeanor as a mild mannered insurance agent.

Finally, there's John C. Reilly as Zeigler, the 'Cowardly Lion' who has the 'nerve' and 'courage' to encourage Tim to just be himself. Like the 'Cowardly Lion' in Oz, Zeigler provides the comic relief throughout the film, constantly challenging the status quo by uttering one outrageous bon mot after another.

President Helgesson might be the Wizard of the piece here, who leads Tim in the wrong direction by awarding The Two Diamond Award to Tim's company after he accepts the bribe. This is akin to Dorothy's fruitless quest for the Wicked Witch's broomstick. And just as the Wizard is 'found out', President Helgesson must be exposed in the end by Tim and his intrepid allies.

'Cedar Rapids' wins points for following the classic story pattern of a hero's mythic journey, albeit told in a decidedly comic fashion. It's also pretty good natured, which is an improvement over Director Arteta's recent and rather cold effort, 'Youth in Revolt'. Nonetheless, 'Cedar' continues the unwholesome tradition of many quirky indie films--the protagonists, in their 'anything goes' behavior, are held up as morally superior to the antagonists, who are merely 'straw men', derided as either sexually perverse, greedy and/or emotionally repressed.

If you dig Cedar's 'anything goes' philosophy, and you accept the simplistic premise that there is an inferior underclass of conservative reactionaries, this is a film that will warm you to the bone. Others , such as myself, will find these types of films to have a few amusing moments but ultimately too smug to be taken seriously.",1326844800,,4548,4.94109947643979

4492953,4,B004X8AIF2,"If I were you, I wouldn't go into Cedar Rapids expecting much in the way of storyline development.

Yes there's a concept involving an insurance agent (Ed Helm's clueless, child-like character) and he visits another town and meets up with John C. Reily's VERY offensive and sexually-motivated character, along with a few females (one of which is an attractive redhead who's pretty silly and flurts with Ed, and another is a prostitute who Ed befriends.  She's always out on the streets, working).

Basically Cedar Rapids is just total nonstop silliness from beginning to end.  Ed Helms is supposed to be the lead character, and I guess he is, but there's a few other characters that share lead role so I'm not sure why his mug is on the DVD cover.

Even though I found myself laughing quite a bit, I really have a hard time believing this is generally considered a quality comedy movie.  Much of it feels quickly slapped together in both the plot development (what little there is, I mean) and the build-up in humor (there wasn't any- it was just a bunch of one-liners).

Some of these scenes such as the character of Ed Helms flurting with the redhead in a swimming pool after a drunken night of fun, and Ed having a girlfriend who's much older than he is and people assuming that she's his mom, are examples of above average laughter.  Nothing earth-shattering of course.

John C. Reilly's dirty sexual-related prankster humor is honestly the funniest part of the movie.  He says the sickest, dirtiest, most inappropriate lines imaginable, haha.

Overall, it's funny, and even though the storyline is suppoesd to be about an insurance agent who wants to set out and impress his boss, don't expect much satisfaction in that regard.  Just a pretty good movie with little in the way of storyline.",1322956800,,1795,4.773462783171521

Don't get me wrong ""Cedar Rapids"" has its share of raunch but balances that with some sweetness rather than meanness.  It's hard for me to believe there is someone as nave as Tim Lippe (Helms), but I'm sure they must exist.  The cast is filled out by John C. Reilly, Isiah Whitlock, Jr. and Anne Heche as fellow insurance salesmen at an annual convention.  Of course they are experienced and each has their own little personal story.  The focus however is on Lippe and how he breaks into the convention protocol.  I thought the movie went a little too far in one scene where Lippe is taken to a ""party"" away from the city by a friendly hooker.  The scenario was an obvious set up for Whitlock to pull his ""The Wire"" character out of mothballs.  Still, overall, funny stuff.",1321401600,,1075,4.523316062176166

Most main-stream comedy nowadays are full of unbelievable story line, nudity, and plenty of vulgar; which have there place in comedy of course. But Cedar Rapids is a believable, real world type of comedy that will make you feel good, with some laughter here and there. This movie reminded of the real-world, not the tv show, but the world that we live in.

The main character (Ed Helms) is an innocent, all-thing-is-good guy who is both naive and ignorant. As he meet new friends and explore a different world, he comes to understand that there are evil, corruption, infidelity, and greed in this world. It's a classic story of a boy growing up to see the world as it truly is, but the boy is already grown up. Is it a cliche? Yes, but with thousands of years of story telling, everything is a cliche in my books.

I found that, now that I am 20, I like these type of movies rather than raunchy comedies such as American Pie, Superbad, etc. I've got to taste what the real world is like; it's not a fantasy land where your parents take care of you, and everything is provided for, world is full of people who are there to stop you, and there are few friends that will stick by you no matter what-ultimately, how your life turns out is all up to you. Knowing this I enjoyed Cedar Rapids a lot, I don't think I would have enjoyed this movie if I saw this during my high school years.

Over all, great, heartfelt movie that will make you both laugh and smile.",1310774400,,1509,4.343971631205674
4492976,5,B004X8AIF2,"I certainly enjoyed this film. It's about a man with principles who seems blunt and corny. He's nave about the ""big city"" and its ""slick"" ways. The big city is Cedar Rapids, Iowa (pop. 126,000) and slick ways are the mind games and deceptions that are commonplace everywhere in the world. The acting was great; I particularly enjoyed Anne Heche's performance as the worldly-wise woman who pursues the man with principles.

Other reviewers at this site have skillfully summarized the plot. It's deceptively simple. It's about a region (the heartland) and people (who are what they appear to be) almost always either neglected or mocked in contemporary film. There is something so refreshingly...honest... about this film.  I hope the people who put this gem together can produce more films with the same vision.",1310688000,,810,5.082706766917293
4492977,4,B004X8AIF2,"The tune that is whistled in the soundtrack of ""Cedar Rapids"" is ""Big Noise From Winnetka"", and though it has been used in a few other movies, it is never so appropriate as it is here.

Making fun of Midwesterners has never been a difficult proposition, but in ""Cedar Rapids"" it is done with such sweetness that it barely causes a wince--and I write this as a lifelong resident of the Midwest.

Though one reviewer likened it to ""The Wizard of Oz"", I think this story more resembles Voltaire's ""Candide"".  A straightlaced, buttoned-down Boy Scout rube named Tim Lippe from the darker recesses of Cheeseheadland gets a golden opportunity to go all the way to Cedar Rapids, Iowa to represent his insurance company in a ballyhooed convention where a mythical ""gold star"" is presented to the most deserving agency.

Basically, it's all a variation on a theme of the innocent religious pilgrim leaving home for college and finding out that the ""corrupt"" morally fallen residents of the dorm are kinder than the bootlickers who follow the rules, and way kinder than the demagogues who hand the rules down.

Jokes about lowered expectations and the general ""sameness"" of the Midwest can get stale, but after a slow start (and especially after John C. Reilly shows up), the laughs are plentiful.  Anne Heche is pretty unrecognizable in red hair, but she nails her portrayal of a bored ""cougar"" of the midlands.

4492981,4,B004X8AIF2,"This movie is an easy watch.  It follows Tom Lippe, an insurance salesman from Rhinelander Wisconsin (He says the Rhineland Valley in the film) on his first trip outside of Wisconsin to the ""big city"" of Cedar Rapids, Iowa for a conference. From there, it's a typical ""fish out of water"" movie that is funny and played really well by Ed Helms. The supporting cast of Anne Hesche as Joan, Isiah Whitlock as Ron, and John C. Riley as Dean did well in adding to the comedy of the movie. John C. Riley's lines are pretty graphic in language, but not far from his typical rolls.  The bonus features on the Blu Ray are pretty good (7 minutes of deletes scenes, plus several little side interviews and behind the scenes featurettes, and a gag reel also.), and BD live works well here also. It is a sleeper that did not get much if any theatre play, but should be checked out.

That being said, I am dissapointed that they did not actually film this on location in Cedar Rapids.  I feel if the movie's name is Cedar Rapids, and the whole film pivots around it, why didn't they pay the extra and film it where it should have been?  They actually filmed it in Ann Arbor, Michigan possibly because of tax breaks that were not offered in Cedar Rapids.  They take several actual views of Cedar Rapids such as the flight over 380 and Mays Island with the Court House and Vet's Coluseum on it, and the riverfront view of Quaker Oats, but several of the street shots, outdoor scenes, and driving shots are of Ann Arbor. I appreciate the mention of the flooding and how Cedar Rapids was resilliant. It also made me chuckle when they mention a restaraunt that was supposed to be at Westdale Mall. Westdale is virtually deserted due to poor economy and since Montgomery Wards left years ago, and now serves as temporary locations for the Library and some City Offices after the flooding of 2008. Overall, I am able to put this aside and enjoy the movie.",1309478400,2,1934,4.4645892351274785

4492983,4,B004X8AIF2,"""Know thyself"" may be the world's oldest maxim. Unfortunately, Cedar Rapids, the heartland comedy about self-discovery directed by Miguel Arteta, forgets that vital chestnut, and ultimately misses greatness. It's a shame because the movie has one of the best ensemble casts any comedy could ask for.

Ed Helms of The Hangover movies plays a lowly insurance salesman named Tim Lippe in the fictional town of Brown Valley, Wis., which he has never left thanks to serious abandonment issues. Tim's simple joys -- he's the most innocent comedic hero since The 40-Year Old Virgin's Andy Stitzer -- come from serving customers honestly and making weekly love to his former seventh-grade teacher (Sigourney Weaver).

Mostly, Tim toils away earnestly for Brown Star Insurance. Famed as much for its Christian values as for its high-quality service, the firm has won three consecutive Two Diamond awards, a coveted industry prize handed out at the annual insurance convention in the metropolis of Cedar Rapids. This is one of those gatherings where attendees speak reverently of a competitor having ""the sixth biggest agency in the upper Midwest."" Just before the convention, Brown Star's star agent dies, which is bad enough, but the dubious circumstances of his death have made it both impossible and imperative that the company win this year's trophy ... and it's up to Tim to save Brown Star.

For anyone else, a trip to Cedar Rapids would be an exercise in escaping tedium, but Tim might as well be heading to Spring Break in Cancun. In the span of two days, Tim meets a dizzying cast of friends, competitors and enemies; John C. Reilly, Anne Heche and The Wire's Isiah Whitlock Jr. stand out in their supporting roles. But one wishes that the writers could have done more with Rob Corddry (Hot Tub Time Machine) and Alia Shawkat (Arrested Development).

Despite some gut-busting scenes, Cedar Rapids isn't quite sure what it supposed to be. It has elements of a sex farce, a buddy movie, a Michael J. Fox small-town-boy-makes-good-in-the-big-city flick, a satire of small-time corporate hypocrisy along the lines of the vastly superior Election, and a romantic comedy. Thanks to the stellar cast, we care about the characters as the movie whisks along. Helms proves his comic chops but also plumbs surprising depths of pathos as his illusions of love and integrity are shattered; he's a good enough actor to stay with this funny but uneven movie, and that's paying him high praise.

DVD extras include deleted scenes, a gag reel and a few making-of segments.

4492988,4,B004X8AIF2,"It seems that every now and then a small movie makes big noise. They're usually an independent film that was made for almost no money, if they're lucky they get a star or two and they become noticed at film festivals. CLERKS was one such film and so was LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. So when I heard that CEDAR RAPIDS was this years talked about indie film I wondered if it was true or not. Yes, the movie lives up to its reputation. It's hilarious.

Ed Helms (of HANGOVER and THE OFFICE fame) stars as Tim Lippe, a modest insurance salesman in a small town who was destined for great things but never seemed to get there. His life is rather hum drum, he's never been anywhere outside of this small town and the thrill of his life is his girlfriend Macy (Sigourney Weaver), his old 7th grade teacher.

Currently he plays second fiddle to Roger, the top guy who has always represented the company well at the national convention, bringing them back 2 Double Diamond trophies in a row. When Roger is found hung with his own belt in an act of autoerotic asphyxiation, Tim is selected as his replacement. The company's owner Bill (Stephen Root) gives him advice and books him in a room with a safe fellow insurance salesman.

Unfortunately the best laid plans...

His roommate Ronald Wilkes (Isiah Whitlock, Jr.) and he are upgraded to a suite since the hotel overbooked. Unfortunately they have to take in a third party and that person is Dean Zeigler (John C. Reilly), a wild man that Bill warned Tim to stay away from. As is usually the case, Dean isn't quite as bad as Bill made him out to be even if he is a horn dog and a guy who likes to have far too much fun.

As the threesome gets acquainted they're joined by Joan Ostrowski-Fox (Anne Heche), another insurance salesperson who knows everyone but Tim. The four become fast friends as the film progresses and find themselves in various predicaments.

As Tim attempts to become one of the boys, he finds friendships tested and his morals questioned due to a twist in his plans he didn't account for. He finds himself forced to question a few of his beliefs, to open himself up to the world outside of his small town and to basically grow up. Through it all he makes some fantastic life long friends.

I know, an insurance salesman convention doesn't sound like the most interesting thing on the planet. But the fact is that these characters are likeable, crazy, fun, interesting and more complex than you would think. The spots they find themselves in are funny at times and touching at others. These characters are ones you'd like to have a drink with.

The film offers some great writing and directing as both bring out the best in these actors. I've not seen Heche do a character as well as she does Joan, a woman in what could be a loveless marriage who makes the convention a time to let loose. Reilly has this character down pat having played similar ones before. There was no way anyone else could have played this character. And Whitlock does a great turn here as a straight laced salesman who has a side he rarely lets anyone else see.

But the central character here of Tim as played by Helms is great. He could have gone for goofy, he could have overdone the aw shucks attitude. But Helms plays it straighter than that and the character of Tim Lippe is better off for it. You first think of him as a buffoon but by the end of the film come to care about him deeply.

CEDAR RAPIDS proves one thing. You don't have to have a mega-million dollar budget to make a great movie. You just have to make something original, something entertaining and something that will make people laugh. This film does all three and does them well.",1308960000,4,3681,4.472429210134128

There were not many laughs at all and stuck in between was this very awkward storyline that attempted to be a well rounded script, but just failed on every level. It was very uncomfortable at times when it seemed sometimes was meant to be funny, but I was not sure what to do because it wasn't. It is not one of those movies that you can watch over and over, still laugh and have fun. Its more like a movie you can watch when you have extra money to waste, see it at a garage sale or something, or if you can borrow it off the schmuck that actually bought it. Not really worth it at all. I sat through it constantly waiting for a good laugh that never really came. The black guy was definetly funnier than anyone else.",1308873600,3,870,4.153846153846154

I just sat at the lunch table and talked movies with work folks. Some liked horror, others gore, others art films (no argument from me on art films) but I said what I enjoy most at the movies is laughing. If you're in that vein, get this.

I'm at work, so I'm not taking the time to read the other reviews but I'm pleased to see so five star reviews.

He was believable and the writing made for a legitimate comedy without having to be stupid and unfunny like some other titles released this quarter with $20 million stars.

The quirky tale follows an unexposed-to-the-real-world insurance salesman as he travels to a big convention where he learns to grow out of his shell. The process is fun to watch and the comedy can be dry, slightly drug-induced, but always revelatory and sharp. The Blu clarity is great as is the sound, and even though there are a few falters infrequently with the darks and low colors, overall the preservation is solid. The supplements are great and give this product an over-5-star rating:

* Deleted scenes, 7 @ 7:19 minutes. To see any Sigourney Weaver scenes end up on the floor is tough, and the comedy they removed was funny - should have all been in the film.
* Gag reel, 4:17 minutes. Not as funny as I had hoped.
* Convention Connection, 6 @ 13:19 minutes with a play all. The six main characters talk about their time on the set, the comedy and their characters...worth the watch.
* Mike O Malley, Urban Clogger, 2:55 minutes. The work put into the dancing segment of the talent show.
* Tweaking USA, 6:13 minutes. A behind the scenes of what went into the party sequence - if you are a fan of Corddry here is your supplement. He is in this for more minutes than in the film - and funnier.
* Crashing a Lesbian Wedding, 4:16 minutes. The production that went into making the wedding crasher scene.
* Top Notch commerical, 1:16 minutes. A lodef bloody ad that showcases Helm selling insurance, slightly funny.
* Director interview, 6:37 minutes, lodef. Fox Movie Channel supplement with the obligatory footage and promo stuff.
* Writer interview, 6:47 minutes. Same thing and specs as prior segment.

After meeting a group of veterans including Dean Ziegler (Reilly) he begins to change his view on life, and the insurance group he works for.  Much like ""Elektra Luxx"" this week this was not what I expected.  This was also better though.  While this does have some very, very funny parts, this movie is also very moving and will have you pulling for all the characters to get what they want.  Ed Helms is the perfect choice for this movie.  He is great at playing the shy, awkward man that has the talents to succed but just can't ever seem to.  This character is a little more toned down then Andy from ""The Office"", but it's much closer to him then Stu from ""The Hangover"".  This is not the laugh-out-loud comedy like in ""Hangover"" or ""Step-Brothers"", but if your looking for a smart, intellegent, heartfelt independent comedy then this is exactely what you are looking for.

4492995,1,B004X8AIF2,"Cedar Rapids has its specific premise and agenda - it is yet another movie in Hollywood's recent series of flicks made for one specific purpose: to fight ""religion"". Many clues indicate that the War is not on just any religion.

This time the plot is around an annual convention of insurance agents in ""big city"" (Cedar Rapids, IA) and their coveted Double-Diamond Award. The tone of the convention is set by its president played by Kurtwood Smith. Smith's character appears to be ""religious"" - he talks ""God"" a lot and leads prayer before meals at the convention much to the displeasure of... whom? You guess it, John Reilly's character. Reilly has no patience for ""religion"". Visibly disgusted with Smith's ""religion"" Reilly calls him ""f'ing Pope"".

Things develop towards inevitable twist: in the end antireligious Reilly comes out as the man of wholesome integrity and religious Smith is exposed as dishonest crook.
