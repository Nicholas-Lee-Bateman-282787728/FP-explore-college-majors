However, I like how the stunning array of visuals in this film is supported by an interesting storyline.

Libor Podmol, a Czech freestyle motocross rider, came to the U.S. with very little recognition, but he has obviously worked incredibly hard to get to the top of the FMX game.

When he won a silver medal at the XGames in LA a few weeks ago, he cemented his position as one of the best FMX riders in the world.

Whether you're a fan of the sport, or you're just looking for a classic story about a man's rise from nothing to the top of his sport, this is a great option.",1376611200,,692,4.103703703703704
