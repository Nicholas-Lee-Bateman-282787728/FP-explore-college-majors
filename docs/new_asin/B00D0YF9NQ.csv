Anyway, the video quality is not true DVD quality, seems like a  "" B + ""  video & sound  grade transfer to DVD.  But as said, there are not many to begin with, so I am VERY HAPPY with this one !!!  No DVD extras.  GREAT price & very hard to find too !!!  A very fun & engoyable concert DVD !!!",1376265600,,371,3.641025641025641
