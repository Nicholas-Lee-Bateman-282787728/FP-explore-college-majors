This is exactly what I wanted to see from a how to grow video.  I watched the dvd for the first time with 2 beginner growers and 1 expert and we were all beside ourselves.  We all learned a lot and most importantly, we gained the confidence to GO FOR IT!!

My favorite part was SeeMore showing how easy it is to maintain a big or small garden.  GOOD JOB  This movie is a 10.., I highly recommend it

 One final note, I ordered the dvd in the morning and it arrived the next day!",1107216000,4,500,4.082474226804123

8048665,4,B0007LY7QK,"I think it's funny how people say that the video doesn't give a detailed breakdown of his crops.  You are either blind or stupid.  He tells you what he's doing and how he set it up.  He tells you the PH, PPM,watts per square foot and so on. You may have seen the video, but you obviously weren't watching.  Take notes.",1327190400,,318,4.163934426229508

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY....AND BY THE WAY I HAVE THIS DVD FOR SALE............JUST BAD ALL AROUND.... HONEST IT IS A BUST........WHAT PEOPLE DO FOR THE BUCK..........",1233878400,6,251,4.478260869565218
8048667,1,B0007LY7QK,"Don't bother getting this unless you already own everything else! It's good to see everyone's setup, but SeeMoreBuds doesn't show you much. This movie is more for an entertaining view, than to be an informative guide from which to learn. SeeMoreBuds does NOT show you details regarding PH, PPM, nutrient usage, equipment requirements, etc... If you seek knowledge, learn from a pro:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Times-Growers-Series-Jorge-Cervantes-Ultimate-Grow-DVD/dp/B000E3E266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Times Growers Series: Jorge Cervantes' Ultimate Grow DVD</a>",1183680000,15,624,7.561643835616438
8048668,2,B0007LY7QK,I dunno if the other reviews on here are astroturfing or what but this video sucks! It has some pretty pictures but doesn't tell you how to set anything up. It just provides a few general tips that you could find on any online forum in a couple minutes. Save your money.,1168905600,7,270,4.211538461538462
8048669,5,B0007LY7QK,"SeeMore is funny and sharp...he's to the point and informative.  I love the systems you use, I'm inspired to try them.  You're the real deal.  Thanks SEEMORE...I can't wait to see what's next!!!!",1121126400,3,195,4.848484848484849
8048670,5,B0007LY7QK,"I was skeptical at first.  SeeMoreBuds is my 3rd grow dvd.  The first 2 were LAME (most grow DVD's are BAD). SeeMoreBuds is awesome.  The DVD is full of great pictures and detailed information.  I've have watched it 4 times in the past 3 months and learn something new everytime.  I felt like I owed these guys a review since I paid $25 for the DVD and have made $45,000 in 3 months. hahahah

Rumor has it, SMB II is on the way!!!!  yeah!!!

peace",1118016000,4,447,4.176470588235294
8048671,5,B0007LY7QK,"This video delivers clear cut audio and visuals that don't just show you, but draw you in and ask you to sit down. You'll accidentally learn everything you need, making the follow through as easy going as the days of the month.  When you finish watching, you'll really know how to.",1111104000,3,281,4.509803921568627
8048672,5,B0007LY7QK,"Great Job...  I have wathced it 3 time already and I learn something new every time.  The operation you see in this movie is simple and the harvest is awesome!  This is the fourth grow video I have seen, and SeeMoreBuds is the undisputed CHAMP!",1108598400,3,244,4.377777777777778
8048673,5,B0007LY7QK,"Seemorebuds's advice on how to put together a grow room, where to do it, what to buy, where you can ""cut corners"" and EXACTLY how to do it was really informative.  I've read through lots of books and magazine articles on ""how to grow"" and I thought I knew how to do it....BUT having the chance to see it and have someone walk you through it was INVALUABLE and INSPIRING.  It was also surprisingly entertaining... my friends and I even enjoy just looking at all the buds!  Kudos Seemore...thanks!!!  I can't wait for your next one!!!!",1107216000,3,533,4.520833333333333
