8196871,5,B000QQJM5M,Item was as described by merchant.,1407888000,,34,4.833333333333333
8196872,2,B000QQJM5M,"This is for those who like cheap ""B-movies"" (most of these are ""C' or even ""D"" movies). Of the 20 movies here, I could only watch 6 or 7.  For those who like 60's and 70's Japanese, dubbed English Sci-Fi will enjoy them.",1367539200,,220,4.116279069767442
8196873,5,B000QQJM5M,"These dvds are mass produced and super cheap,I enjoyed every movie on here,After buying several of these 10 to 200 movie packs,and not being able to play them on my nice sony player,I bought a LG Bluray player,better but not much. I then decided to try this,I went to HH Gregg,because they have the best stuff,best warrenty,best price,and best sales people. This is all true. I bought a 20 to 30 dollar dvd player,some y connectors,hooked it up on same line as my blueray,and have watched every one of these cheap dvds. IT WORKS.",1291680000,2,529,4.638297872340425
8196874,1,B000QQJM5M,"All praise to the Amazon Marketplace seller, who paid for shipping on two of these turkeys and finally gave me full credit. All the discs in both sets were unwatchably glitchy, several of them freezing at the menu, not even letting you get so far as watching the actual movies skip, slow down, and lock up.  I love bad scifi and was really looking forward to this set, but I think two attempts is sufficient for me to say to you: ""Don't bother. Mill Creek obviously has no quality control, and you are doomed to disappointment.""",1269129600,,528,4.5
8196875,1,B000QQJM5M,"I bought this pack thinking I couldn't go wrong for $6 or $7 dollars.  I was wrong.  The production quality of the movies is not very good.  Four or five don't play on my DVD players (I have three).  Some that do skip and jump.  I would never buy this again, especially if it was from Mill Creek Entertainment.  Buyer beware!",1250985600,,325,4.245901639344262
8196876,3,B000QQJM5M,"The ALIEN WORLDS 20 Movie Pack is a unique mix of the many public domain sci-fi films available from MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT.

MILL CREEK box sets offer good-to-average-quality audio and video transfers of public domain material at a most reasonable price.
