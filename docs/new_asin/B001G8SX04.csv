3597951,5,B001G8SX04,"What? More MST3K? Indeed there is, and this is a pretty good basket to watch spanning multiple eras of this long-lived (and much missed) comedy series.

103- Mad Monster (with Commando Cody/Radar Part 2)  Definitely a curiosity, AFAIK this episode hasn't been seen on TV in maybe 15 years or so.  There was somewhat of a moratorium on Season 1 during the early- to mid-90s period, only lifted for a very brief period in 1995.  A lot of this episode is nascent MST3K, and not very polished, but it does offer a view of the evolution of the series. Quite bluntly, there is a lot of dead space and it's not funny in places, but still a worthwhile investment of 90 minutes.

413- Manhunt In Space - this is the reason to spend your hard-earned cash on this set.  A hilarious episode from MST3K's Joel-era Comedy Central heyday, and little-seen for over a decade without trafficking in gray-market bootleg video copies.  Has a ""General Hospital"" short (actually a 15-minute vintage episode from the 1950s), and the main feature is a typical 1950s television space opera.  There is a typically insane invention exchange (beanbag pants)

1001- Soultaker  Where 103 ""Mad Monster"" is rough, this is MST3K in its most polished form.  There's a ridiculous sci-fi/horror movie at its core involving grim reapers and one of Martin Sheen's relatives. However, the reason this episode is great is the temporary return of two former MST3K performers and writers, TV's Frank and Joel.  The host segment subplot involves malfunctions on the Satellite of Love, and a mysterious visitor trying to make contact and fix the problem.  Frank shows up as a Soultaker, much in the same fashion that goofy characters from the movie would show up at the end of the episode in the Comedy Central era.  Recommended, and it's great that we have this on DVD.

1008- Final Justice  Maybe a bit of a disappointment, only because this episode aired very frequently towards the end of the series.  Still, the Joe Don Baker jokes inexplicably never wear thin.  An incomprehensive and inconsequential plot involving a Texas lawman's manhunt from the southwest to Malta are a perfect backdrop to vicious riffing...the host segments are only ok, I could do without hearing ""Goosio"" again for the rest of my life.

In summary, can't speak for the Shout Factory packaging and extras, but the episodes themselves are worthwhile and great to have archived in DVD.",1231459200,9,2419,4.87041564792176
3597952,5,B001G8SX04,"Shout Factory's second 4-disc DVD MST3K release features two episodes hosted by Joel Hodgson from the Comedy Central years and two hosted by Mike Nelson from the Sci-Fi Channel years of the show.

103- Mad Monster (with short: Commando Cody And Radar Men From The Moon - Part 2)
This season one gem features George Zucco and Glenn Strange in a 1942 film about a mad scientist that turns humans into monsters by injecting them with the blood of wolves. Even in 1942 this was silly, rehashed horror fodder from better movies. George Zucco's usual decent acting helps make this at least amusing. Glenn Strange often played monsters in films of the time. The short is perhaps the funniest part of this episode. Joel and the 'bots always struck comedy gold when making fun of Radar Men From The Moon in several season one episodes. This episode also features the hilarious sketch where Tom Servo (Josh Weinstein) makes a pass at a blender!

413- Manhunt in Space (with short: ""General Hospital"" - Segment 1)
This 1954 TV space adventure will have you in stitches. The effects are less than state-of-the-art even for the day, although they were so expensive they contributed to the show being canceled! Rocky Jones is a square-jawed fisticuffs wielding spaceship pilot with REALLY goofy sidekicks, including Winky, a young man who acts like a kid, and Bobby, a little kid that acts all grown-up. Then there's short-skirted Vena, his bright female crewmate that gets treated like, well, like women were mostly treated in the US in 1950's TV. Finally, there's elderly and brilliant Professor Newton, who in spite of being a genius, makes just enough miscalculations to get them into real trouble. Joel and the 'bots offer endless riffs about anything and everything during this one, it's terrific fun. Host segment highlights include the ""space modifiers"" sketch and the 'bots playing soap opera after the General Hospital short. Somehow, MST3K manages to make the dull-as-dishwater paced General Hospital short really funny as well. Personally, I love this episode. Rocky Jones and other similar rocketship space adventures always worked well on the show. They are lighthearted fun and the writers wrote hundreds of great jokes for all of them.

1001- Soultaker
This 1990 hokum about souls trying to get back to their bodies while evading the angel of death, who is also an angel of mediocre acting, is entertaining only because MST3K is making fun of it. Wait till you see the wooden acting of Joe Estevez and the huge-headed Robert Zdar. Calling their performances funny is an understatement; you have to see this to believe it. This episode of MST3K features guest appearances by creator and former host Joel Hodgson and former writer and performer Frank Conniff.

1008- Final Justice
This Joe Don Baker film from 1985 is a decent episode from MST3K's final season. Once again, Joe Don plays a cop who ""doesn't play by the rules"", another bad Dirty Harry rip-off anti-hero character. It's basically Mitchell with location shooting in Malta. There are some pretty girls, dumb action sequences, lots of violence, continuity errors, and a somewhat predictable ending. As usual, the MST3K writers have a fairly easy time making fun of the film's action ""star"". Note that the film's writer and director, Greydon Clark, was also responsible for the film Angel's Revenge shown in episode 622 of MST3K.

Extra features on the DVDs include:
* A new interview with ""Soultaker"" star Joe Estevez.
* Mike, Tom and Crow's appearance on ESPN Classic's ""Cheap Seats Without Ron Parker.""
* An interview with ""Final Justice"" writer and director Greydon Clark.",1231113600,49,3637,5.00495867768595
3597953,5,B001G8SX04,"The latest box sex from Shout Factory in my opinion this is worth owning. If you are a fan of the show you probably own most of these sets anyway,with die hard fans owning them all,whether or not you like the episodes,you do get them on superior quality DVD. The set contains 4 mini posters,basically the artwork of the DVD sleeves on a mini poster that fits inside the box. All the DVD have their own slim cases just like the 20th Anniversary set.
This set contains 2 Joel and 2 Mike episodes. They are as follows
MAD MONSTER - Episode # 103 This is a campy (of course) B movie with George Zucco making an ape like monster out of Glenn Strange (Frankenstein's monster in House of Frankenstein and Dracula) - This is a Season 1 show, you can see the earliest work by Joel,Trace,and Josh - this is show # 103 in the series - so it is very early - the earliest episode on DVD. It has different shades of silhouettes too. It shifts from gray to black depending on the movie. The quality of this DVD there is a little bit of minor blips here and there, and the transfer for Mad Monster isn't that good, but the movie is a public domain title that Alpha DVD has released, but the host segment scenes' quality is fine. This one has the segment where Tom is romancing a blender and Joel drinks from it. Tom says ""youre drinking from my girl"" A great Josh line as the first Tom Servo. This is a fun early episode, great from a historical standpoint, and a chance to see a Season 1. Best Brains said these weren't their best shows, and maybe they weren't but these are still interesting and fun to watch at the very least. I feel the MST3K Crew have nothing to be embarrassed about. Season 1 is part of the evolution of MST & I urge Shout Factory to release more from the first Season. How else can we see Josh as Tom Servo or Dr Erhardt ??
MANHUNT IN SPACE Show # 413 - This is a Rocky Jones scifi cheese that kids used to watch on the weekends. Basically it is a low budget that hampers its efforts. The show also has a General Hospital Short. Not considered a mega popular episode,but certainly a good one/a solid episode, with a minor low budget science fiction episode. The first of 2 Rocky Jones movies. This one has some great dialog in the movie like the ""gay nightlife"" and Winky says ""Ride the Rocket"". The skits were ok-good, Joel looking stoned in this one. Mike Nelson, who went on to be Mike Nelson after Joel left, was Winky in the hexfield view screen in a segement.
SOULTAKER - Episode # 1001 Mike on SciFi - This one has Joel returning to the SOL and meets Mike - this is considered a very key episode. Joel returns to save the ship because Dr. F had planned for the SOL to be destroyed after 10 yrs. It was really cool having Joel and Mike 'meet'. Joel goes back to Earth leaving Mike on the SOL to be a man. You have to sit through a tedious movie about Joe Estivez trying to collect souls to get to the segments. TV's Frank also guest stars as a Soultaker and gets along with Bobo (they play ring toss with Bobos soul). This has the Joe Estivez interview about Soultaker and MST3K. It is pretty decent & insightful about the making of Soultaker (he felt it was a good movie and thought it was scary,hmm)
FINAL JUSTICE - Episode #  1008 is another Mike on the SciFi Channel- It's a Joe Don Baker movie, nuff said,here. Joe Don was a huge target for Best Brains. Popular episode because of this. Joe Don is a sheriff who has to chase down a man in Malta. Honestly, it is not all that bad of a movie. I personally found it more entertaining action wise than Mitchell. I loved the segment at the end where Mike thinks he is going back to Earth like Joel did after watching a Joe Don Baker film. This has a couple of bonus features including an interview with Greydon Clark.
Overall the set is a nice blend of titles, and basically reminds me of any of the last couple of Rhino sets with the features. it is nice to have these all in nice clear transfers (even though the movies themselves haven't been remastered, the segments look great)
Shout Factory is closing on on getting all the Season 10 titles on DVD that they can get it seems (I doubt they can get Squirm, Diabolik or It lives by Night anytime soon). I am thankful as are many MST3K fans that Shout Factory is releasing these, whether you like an episode or not, at least they are still coming out on DVD.",1230854400,17,4374,4.244604316546763

3597961,5,B001G8SX04,"Once again its another great set of Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes as we get four more good riffing of bad films with two featuring Joel and two with Mike.

Episode 103: Mad Monster with short Commando Cody and Radar Men From The Moon Part 2
Another from Season One, this one has a mad scientist who injects a slow witted guy with wolf blood so he could have his revenge on those people who laughed at his experiments. Its a dull, slow witted movie honestly, not very lively and quite cheesy. Joel and the bots do their best to lessen the pain from the feature and they do succeed more than fail. The riffs get more rapid fire as the film goes on and they at least they do well with the Commando Cody short. Best Line: Servo's version of the the Beverly Hillbillies theme, very funny.

Episode 413: Manhunt In Space with short General Hospital: Segment 1
This is cobbled together pieces of episodes taken from a short lived show called ""Rocky Jones Space Ranger"", where Rocky Jones and his band of friends try to stop an evil queen. Its a total hoot from start to finish as Joel and the bots just rip apart the chracters namely Rocky's sidekick Winky and also the super cheesy effects. Their reactions to Winky saying lines like ""The gay nightlife"" and ""Ride the rocket"" are especially funny. They also do a great job riffing the General Hospital short, good times had by all. Best Line: ""I'm speaking to you over a Jimmy Dean sausage"".

Episode 1001: Soultaker
From 1990 this stars MST punching bags Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar, with Estevez as a soultaker who is charged with retrieving 4 souls who got misplaced in time or something like that, Z'Dar is like the main guy of the soultakers, I think. Basically the 4 souls are in limbo and two of them one who wrote the movie are trying to get to their bodies before the plug at the hospital is pulled. The crew riffs away in hilarious fashion, aiming at anyone especially Estevez and Z'Dar, who are laughably bad. Best Line: ""Umm.... there are a few medical procedures we could try if you would step out of the way""

Episode 1008: Final Justice
Starring Joe Don Baker, this is a film where a texas sheriff arrests a mafia member, transports him to Rome for trial but loses him on the island of Malta and the rest of the film is one chase scene after another. Its not the worst film they've ever done, there are a few decent parts, but its mainly boring and has a very predictable ending. Baker and any of the Maltese men take the brunt of the jokes from Mike and the Bots and they are often hilarious. Best Line: ""Revenge is a dish best served with laughter and giggles""

3597963,4,B001G8SX04,"What's in store for you in Vol. XIV? Read on...

Mad Monster
A 1942 wannabe werewolf film shot in very badly fading black and white. The Plot? Well, a mad scientist, whose work was laughed out of his former university, uses a serum developed from wolves to turn his gardener into a mad monster and get back at those who wronged him. Lots of fog, lots of bad makeup effects, and a lot of terrifically bad acting. This is a Season One episode before TV's Frank entered the picture, and includes a Commando Cody short. Joel Hosts.

Manhunt in Space
Made from three episodes of a TV show from the 1950s called ""Rocky Jones, Space Ranger,"" this is a generic tale of space pirates...IN SPACE! And a cloaking device. And a lot of people in capes, for some reason. I dunno. Rocky's geeky sidekick bears the full brunt of Joel and the gang's heckling. Some pure genius here, and there's also a General Hospital short to start it all off.

Soul Taker
This episode from the final season finds Mike and crew dealing with a terrible life-after-death flick starring Joe Estevez as...the Soultaker. It's so 80s, its hard to watch as the displaced souls of our heroes run around a town trying to outwit the Soultaker, who never seems to move faster than a brisk walk. And it's written by one of the stars!

Final Justice
One of the my personal favorites, Joe Don Baker stars as a Texas sheriff who, by happenstance, finds himself chasing down a kingpin of crime in exotic . . . Malta? Another episode from the final season, Mike and the gang have a field day not only with Joe Don's corpulent character, but also with the dismal portrayal of the island of Malta itself.

3597967,5,B001G8SX04,"I am really happy I got this volume because, frankly, I missed many of these shows when they first were run.  So for me it was like discovering MST3K all over again!

Mad Monster, Show 103, is the third MST3K played on the Comedy Channel, before it was renamed Comedy Central, and also has a episode of Commando Cody And The Radar Men From The Moon.  It is one of those I missed.  MST3K was brand new and it took a few weeks before people started to turn on the TV every week to watch.  Like most of the first films, Mad Monster is in Black and White, a bad sci-fi film about a scientist who finds out how to turn men into monsters.  Well, in this case a werewolf.  But funny enough that wolf looks more like a coyote.  But why nitpick on the small stuff?

Manhunt In Space, Show 413, was also one of the shows I, somehow, missed.  It comes with a General Hospital episode.  Both the movie and the short are in Black and White.  The movie is in fact a television series in which some of the episodes were spliced together to make a full movie.  There are everything from Space Ghost references to one reference to Daleks!  They also talk about Cold Light, which I thought came from Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, and I learned to never open the hatch without peeking out a window first.

Soultaker, Show 1001, is a very famous episode within the cult that is MST3K.  Not only does it have Joe Estevez, who also starred in Werewolf, and Robert Z'Dar, who was in Future War, in the film, but TV's Frank and Joel both come back to make a appearance on the show.  Such love and warmth.  Too bad the film is so bad.  But that's good!  Because bad films are Mike and the Bots' bread and butter.
They have a interview with Joe Estevez on the DVD.

The last episode in the set is Final Justice, Show 1008, starring Joe Don Baker.  Mike and the Bots have a ton of fun with this film.  ""Hey, you going to finish that?""  The movie is full of lovely ladies, gun fights, a chase with Joe Don Baker going after a Maltese mob member dressed up as a Monk.  Or is it a member of the Italian Mafia?  Lots of food jokes.  In fact tons of jokes all about either Joe Don Baker or Maltese men.  The writer, producer and director is Greydon Clark.  They even have a interview with him on the DVD!

The set came with cool mini-posters - I got an extra Soultaker poster by accident!  A must for any library of MST3K or any collection of bad movies.",1239753600,2,2427,4.188311688311688

Shout! Factory moved quickly after acquiring the DVD rights for Mystery Science Theater 3000. Not only did they roll out a DVD box set celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the show's debut, but they swiftly produced a follow-up, the 14th box set, retaining the numbering system started by Rhino Records. Ironically, at least one of the episodes from this box set probably would have been more appropriate in a celebratory anniversary set. However, this is not a time to quibble about box set labeling. The important question is: how are these episodes?

MAD MONSTER (1942)
(with short: an episode of the serial, RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON)

This is your typical WWII-werewolf movie where a mad scientist turns his faithful but slow-witted gardener into a wolfman in order to demonstrate how to create an army that would beat the Nazis. As an added bonus the mere existence of this new species of half-man, half-wolf proves that his ex-colleagues were pathetically wrong about his mental balance while simultaneously increasing the schadenfreuden by having them brutally killed.

This is the third episode from the first national season of the show and is currently the earliest episode of the show to be released on DVD. We're early enough that Best Brains were still experimenting with how best to display the black theater seat silhouettes onto a black and white film. At many points watching the brightness and contrast shift on Joel and the bots is more interesting that what's going on in the creaky and slow-moving film.

MAD MONSTER is a tough episode to get through. I find often that in the first season the jokes aren't quite as sharp or (more importantly) as rapid-fire as we became used to in later seasons. So a dull movie like this really takes a toll on the audience.

(As an aside, this episode is so early that an apparent mistake left in the show has Joel accidentally mixing up the names of Tom and Crow in the theater.)

MANHUNT IN SPACE (1956)
(with short: an episode of ""General Hospital"")

This film is actually an edited-together collection of a few related episodes of ""Rocky Jones, Space Ranger"" and is very much a product of its era. For example, the cast features a precocious and annoying kid. The bad guys are inconceivably dumb. The good girl wears a mini-skirt and the bad girl wears a slinky evening gown. Astronauts don't need to wear spacesuits, just ill-fitting helmets over a t-shirts and slacks.

The plot meanders around quite a bit, which isn't surprising given its episodic nature. The story opens with space pirates attacking helpless ships and closes with an unresolved storyline involving the invention of a Romulan-type cloaking device. Fortunately, there are many good riffs from Joel and the bots to keep the action going. Also, the short film featured at the front of the episode was an excerpt from ""General Hospital"". MST3k did a few episodes of this, and this take was the first one I've seen. I'm glad they put this on here, and it bodes well for future releases of episodes with ""General Hospital"" shorts.

SOUL TAKER (1990)

Four teenagers are involved in a fatal car accident and attempt to cheat death by having their souls leave their bodies and run very quickly away from Joe ""Brother of Martin Sheen"" Estevez and Robert Z'Dar who are the odd couple Angels of Death. As Death slowly catches up with them, their souls are captured in little black rings and then taken to the attic of the city hospital which apparently doubles as either purgatory or the pearly gates; the exact theology is a little unclear. Also confusing is the exact nature of the Soul Takers: are they just collecting souls who have naturally reached the end of their natural life or are they hunting down people and collecting souls for their own purposes?

This is not the worst movie that MST3k ever tackled (indeed, there's aspects of the film that I quite like), but its occasional silliness and lack of coherence make it ideal for the riff treatment.  This is one of the stronger episodes from the Sci-Fi Channel era, although it's more notable among many MST3k fans for the host segments featuring the cameo return appearances by Joel Hodgson and Frank Coniff than it is for the movie-riffing.

FINAL JUSTICE (1984)

MST3k didn't only make fun of sci-fi/fantasy films and it's nice to have a non-genre offering from an era that had only a few such examples; this is less of a Spaghetti Western and more of a  Spaghetti Standard-Joe-Don-Baker film.  Here, Baker stars as the improbably named Deputy Sheriff Thomas Jefferson Geronimo III who loses track of an international criminal while transferring him to the European authorities and must chase the crook all over the island of Malta.

FINAL JUSTICE is certainly dull in places, but is not an overwhelmingly bad film.  The last Joe Don Baker movie riffed by the crew was MITCHELL, during Joel Hodgson's final episode, and they pick up right where they left off with laughs galore coming mostly at the expensive of the Baker's previous Mitchell character.  This is another funny episode and I liked the gag of Mike thinking it was his time to depart the Satellite of Love since Joel's escape has coincided with his viewing of a bad Joe Don Baker movie.

Extras

This box set includes two interview subjects: Greydon Clark (writer/director/producer of FINAL JUSTICE) and Joe Estevez (star of SOUL TAKER).  Both men have been associated with other MST3k-ed episodes, but they're only apparently asked about the episodes in this release.  There's not a lot of insight to be had, although the pair independently come across as grateful for the extra exposure and good sports about the MST3k process (although it might be fun to see them on polygraph machines for that).

The other extra of note is a cameo appearance of the silhouettes of Mike Nelson, Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo in a 2005 episode of EPSN's ""Cheap Seats Without Ron Parker"".  While it's nice to have these things out on DVD, my reaction to watching this again is about the same as it was four years ago: my mileage varied.  Now, if the powers that be would release the episodes of ""Talk Soup"" featuring these guys, then I'd be very happy.

Stinger

This isn't the strongest MST3k box set that we've seen, but even average MST3k is worthy.  Overall, I'm happy with this set and can't wait to see what Shout! Factory will put out next.",1236988800,2,6396,4.804010938924339
3597971,4,B001G8SX04,"I've been a fan of MST3K for 15 years, but was always cursed when it came to actually seeing the show.  We didn't get Comedy Central until after MST3K went to SciFi, and we didn't get SciFi until MST3K was cancelled!  We relied on ""MST3K Hour"" episodes and a few reruns from SciFi and friends for years, so you can understand how happy I was -- and am! -- to get MST3K on DVD.

This set includes 4 episodes I had never seen: ""Soultaker"", ""Final Justice"", ""Manhunt in Space"", and ""Mad Monster"".  There are also interviews with Greydon Clark and Joe Estevez, and the episode of ""Cheap Seats"" that featured Mike and the 'Bots.  The quality of the episodes is good, although ""Final Justice"" had a lot of momentary flickers where a few white blocks would flash on screen, I presume as an artifact from the digital transfer.  As we get 4 long episodes (about 1 hr 35 mins without commercials) I don't mind the price tag so much, and I like that the DVDs are packaged individually.

However, the packaging on these new Shout Factory volumes is just plain bad.  The conceit of having Crow and Tom in 50s-era movie posters is a cute one, but wore out its welcome quickly.  The posters you get with the set are just prints of the covers of the individual DVD packages, and they are poorly executed and cheap looking.  The disk menus are also pretty bad, with some weird digital renderings of Crow and Tom moving their heads randomly while they sit in one spot.  I would much rather see an unanimated screen shot than this freaky stuff.

It's easy to compare these designs unfavorably to the old Rhino sets, but I'm certain that even if I didn't have better Rhino sets to compare it to, I'd still find the design lacking.",1235001600,5,1710,4.463022508038585
3597972,3,B001G8SX04,"As I long-time MST3K fan who watched the series in first run from its very first Comedy Channel showing (and I have seen all of the earlier KTMA-series as well), I can't help but be disappointed in these Shout! Factory releases as compared to the Kino boxes. These are vastly inferior treatments both in the available extras on each disc and the almost laughable packaging of the box sets. Gone are the original MST episode reference numbers that Misties have reverently adhered to through the years. In place of the very informative packaging of old are garish cartoon covers that more closely resemble an old Archie & Jughead comic strip than anything remotely related to the series. They give zero information on the movies, stars or any other credits of either the originals or MST crew. The episodes themselves appear to be intact, but the individual discs skimp pathetically on any extras, most noticeably any of the original non-MST versions of the films. Granted, much of this may have been due to copyright restrictions, and it is tempting to just be grateful that any of these wonderful episodes area being re-released. On the other hand, I give a big thumbs down to this cheap and shoddy treatment by The Shout! Factory.",1234742400,3,1231,4.838862559241706
3597973,1,B001G8SX04,"I loved MST3K and watched it religiously for years, however a set with only 4 episodes is a ripoff, considering other TV programs are offering entire seasons for their shows priced similiarly.  I will never buy any of this until entire seasons are available.  Only one TV series is more of a ripoff DVD wise, and that is Bill Nye the Science Guy.",1234656000,5,346,4.476190476190476

8304467,5,B001G8SX04,"Soultaker and Final Justice are two classic ""Mike Bill Kevin"" episodes that I never grow tired of.

Vivian Schilling was 22 when she wrote the screenplay for and starred in Soultaker. She's now a novelist and who occasionally works on film projects.

The bonus interview with Joe Estevez reveals him to be an unpretentious, likable guy with a sense of humor about his career in b-movies. He is the only person from his famous family I'd actually enjoy meeting.

Manhunt in Space is lots of fun. The spaceship sets are like something from a high school play. The Mads and their beanbag pants are hilarious. The old black and white General Hospital short before the movie is interesting to watch from a historical perspective.

Mad Monster is an early MST3K experiment. J. Elvis Weinstein was the obvious weak link in the early episodes, possibly because he was still a teenager at the time. His Dr. Larry ""Curly Howard impersonation"" makes me cringe and his Tom Servo is lifeless and dull.  Watching these early episodes really highlights how much comedy firepower Kevin Murphy and Frank Conniff brought to the show when they replaced Weinstein. The Mad Monster disc also has some annoying extras from other shows Shout Factory was trying to promote. I'm glad they stopped doing that on the later sets.

Now if only Vivian Schilling and Joe Don Baker would make a film together...",1469059200,4,1379,4.846808510638298
8304468,5,B001G8SX04,"This is an excellent MST3K set from Shout Factory, but one that won't be around for long. Since the company has lost the rights to the film ""Soul Taker"", this set is now out of print. If it follows the pattern of other MST3K releases (the Rhino sets or Shout's Volume XXI), then it's going to become a very expensive collection to pick up.

As for the episodes featured, I think they're all excellent. Granted, I'm a huge fan of the series and even enjoy the weakest of episodes. It's one of those series that even with cast changes and changes in voice actors, it still maintained its high level of quality and excellence. If you've never purchased any of the MST3K sets, I'd highly suggest making this collection one of your first choices, if not the first. Not just because it's sure to become very expensive once Amazon runs out of stock, but because of the fantastic episodes included in this collection.",1461888000,,909,4.576687116564417
