8716283,5,B00XLW0AKO,"Incredible!!!! I have trained, in another Japanese art of 'Groundfighting', called ""Ne Waza"" ( Nay-Waza ). Interestingly enough, Shihan ( Master ) Saylor's, teaching and techniques, seem strangely similar to 'Ne Waza'! Video one mostly trains, from standing to ground techniques. While video two, concentrates on being on the ground! I'd highly recommend them, if you can find them.",1478908800,,382,5.491525423728813
