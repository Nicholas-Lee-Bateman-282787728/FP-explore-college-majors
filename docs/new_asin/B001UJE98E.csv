3801880,5,B001UJE98E,Best of all 3 movies. All the pieces come together and your opinion of the werewolves is completely altered.,1238284800,3,108,4.7368421052631575
3801881,4,B001UJE98E,"This movie is the realized back story for the movie ""Underworld"".  There is nothing revelational about this movie to the storyline of the franchise except for Lucian being the source of the modern day Lycans (ability to transform back into human form).  This movie is basically about his development from childhood into the leader of the Lycans and also the love story between him and Sonia (Victor's daughter).  The tie-ins of this movie to the other two were very well written.  While viewing ""Rise of the Lycans"" is not necessary in order to make sense of the other two movies in the franchise, it definitely enriches them and basically adds more seasoning.

The action and battle sequences were exciting and very well done.  But, while I enjoyed the movie, it lacks the plot twists and suspense of the original ""Underworld"".  The acting is good, although I wish Victor would have had some better dialogue.  Rhona Mitra was SUPERB as Sonia.  Her resemblence to Kate Beckensale makes the viewer realize why Victor took Selene under his wing (instead of killing her along with her family).  Selene is absent from this movie except for the final clip which happens to be the opening scene to ""Underworld"" (a good transition). IMHO, this movie ranks 2nd in the franchise. While ""Underworld Evolution"" was enoyable in its own right, the creatures of this franchise look more comfortable (and believable) in midieval times than in the modern day.  If you own the other two movies on DVD/ Blu-ray, you'll definitely want to add this to your Underworld library.",1237939200,54,1556,4.900763358778626

3801937,5,B001UJE98E,"The third of the great Underworld film series. It plays out a love story between a vampire princess (Rhona Mitra) and a Lycan slave (Michael Sheen). It takes place during the Dark Ages and is a prequel to the other Underworld films. Bill Nighy again plays Viktor, the cruel Vampire King.
Although this film is OK, (I have seen it several times), it is the weakest of the four ""Underground"" films. My personal favorite in ""Underground Awakening"". It is full of violence and has a lot of Kate Beckinsale. I recommend that film the most.",1407110400,,534,4.631578947368421
3801938,3,B001UJE98E,"Well, I mainly bought this movie for two reasons-- one, because I got it for a very low price, and two, because I have the others in the series.  But to me this is the weakest of the Underworld movies.
Nothing against Rhona Mitra, who to me is a powerful actress, but we already know the back story to what happened to start the war between the vampires and the lycans, so I was hoping for moving forward in the series, not backwards.  Luckily Kate Beckinsale returned to the series for the next movie, Underworld Awakening, which moves the story forward.
As for this movie, I thoguht it was okay, and own it for the collection--- and fans of the franchise are more than welcome to disagree with me--- but I don't truly believe we needed this movie.",1406592000,,749,4.420289855072464

3801942,4,B001UJE98E,"This film was a good attempt at a prequel to the Underworld series. We learn Lucian's origins and the forbidden love he had with Viktor's daughter, that we got a slight glimpse of in Underworld. This is some minor stuff, but they forgot to put Lucian's brand on his arm that he later gives to Kraven. The film was entertaining and is one I have watched multiple times, but I believe they should've released this film in theaters instead of Awakening. If you enjoyed Underworld and Underworld: Evolution you will enjoy this film.

I hope they make another prequel that could end with the supposed ""death"" of Lucian that is talked about in Underworld, when Selene finds out that Lucian is still alive.",1390780800,,699,4.682926829268292

This is an excellent prequel. Everything you have come to expect from the Underworld franchise is here. Awesome characters, story, special effects, and setting. The film itself is 5 stars. The Blu-ray quality is terrible. The picture is okay, but the audio sucks. To be able to hear the dialogue during the regular non-action parts, you have to turn the volume up really high. BEWARE! The second the action starts or someone raises their voice your ear drums are gonna bleed. There is no happy medium. It's almost like you have to keep the volume down and read subtitles just so that you don't blow your ear drums out when the action starts. It's not my TV or system. I've played it on my surround sound and through my regular TV volume. It's the same. My friend has the Blu-ray also. She says that it does her the same way.

The ability to unlock the digital copy expired on 5/12/10.  Consequently, the digital copy disc is worthless.  However, do enjoy the remaining blu-ray disc of the movie.  The price for the one good disc is fair.  To the credit of the packaging, there is no verbiage on the front cover that claims that there are two discs within.  There is on the back, but who can read print that small anyway.  Enjoy the movie.  I just wanted to give everyone a heads up on the so-called digital copy.",1327708800,,660,4.4789915966386555
3801971,4,B001UJE98E,"After seeing the first two ""Underworlds"" & loving them, I relished the thought of the third, ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans!"" First of all, the two best characters out of the first film were back, ""Lucian,"" Michael Sheen & ""Viktor,"" Bill Nighy!

The first ""Underworld"" hinted at what happened to Lucian 600 years before, as he falls in love with a Vampire, high spirited ""Sonja,"" played convincingly by Rhona Mitra, daughter of Viktor. They secretly rendezvous in the first part of this film, for Lycans are considered beasts, underlings to their slave masters the Vampires, only Lucian has a soupcon of freedom, as he was the first born Lycan that could change back into human form. Viktor found him as a baby & decided to not kill him, as a species of Lycans could benefit & help protect the Vampires from William & his savage non-human changeable Werewolves. Little doe he have any conception what is to ensue.

Lucian loves Sonja deeply, & wants them to run away, something that she at first feels is impossible, but once their discovered, there is no alternative, other than to flee.

Once again, Bill Nighy plays his ""Viktor"" to haughty maniacal perfection, yet when he condemns his daughter Sonya to death, he shows a vulnerable side, but only just for a second, as his indignation totally controls his actions, a true monster in this film of monsters.

Michael Sheen's, ""Lucian,"" is played with total conviction, just what you'd expect from him, from his performance in the first film. He is a leader of undeniable charisma & empathy for his fellow Lycans imprisoned to slavery. He shows a depth & emotion not seen often in horror films, for this is not just a horror film, but a metaphor for all injustices of slavery, but also a love story, of taboo boundaries crossed.

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans,"" gave this fan of this saga exactly want I wanted,a great protagonist & antagonist with the rivalry of Lucian & Viktor! Plenty of Werewolf, Lycan action, a solid plot, fine acting, & all around great special effects! This film is as good as the last, especially due two the two main characters, Lucian & Viktor, whose performances dominate this film! I highly recommend ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" to fans of the first two Underworlds.

3801973,4,B001UJE98E,"Six years after the first ""Underworld"" introduced us to the centuries-old war between vampires and lycans, and three years after ""Underworld: Evolution"" took that war to the next level; we are finally shown what precipitated the conflict with ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"".

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" chronicles the rise to power of Lucian (Michael Sheen), the first lycan in existence. Discovered by the vampire king, Viktor (Bill Nighy), Lucian at first serves as one of the loyal protectors of the vampires' realm. However, over time Lucian's loyalties begin to waver as he yearns to be free and to no longer be treated as a slave. Joined by his lover, Viktor's own daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra), Lucian embarks on a daring plan to free all enslaved lycans, and if necessary, wage war upon their vampire overlords.

Prior to the ""Star Wars"" saga no one had really heard of a prequel. Nowadays, if a franchise proves popular and a backstory is semi-introduced in an installment, don't be surprised if a prequel soon arrives on the scene. The odd thing for me in regards to prequels is that by definition they are created as afterthoughts to the original film and could be potentially weaker than their predecessors.

Sure, the basic story for any given prequel may have existed in someone's head during the filming of the original movie, but it wasn't deemed strong enough to kick-start a franchise on its own. For example: I'm relatively confident that everyone could agree that had ""Star Wars - Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" been the first ""Star Wars"" movie to be released to theaters, George Lucas would have been hard-pressed to continue his series amidst all the negative feedback from critics and many fans alike. So, by starting in the middle of the story (""Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope""), with an arguably richer narrative, the franchise exploded and has become the phenomenon we all know and love today.

The same can be said for this film, ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"", written by Danny McBride (the only returning writer from the previous two films) and the writing duo of Dirk Blackman and Howard McCain (""Outlander"").

Is this a good movie on its own? Yes. Would it have found as big of an audience had it been released prior to ""Underworld""? Most likely not, because the basis for its story was so narrow that it would have been a niche movie for a specific, undoubtedly smaller audience.

The reason being is that the story is essentially a history lesson on the war between vampires and lycans. When people go to see a movie involving vampires and/or lycans they want to see them either embroiled in battle with each other or humanity. By and large, the movie going public would most likely not be interested in an origin tale for a fictional war between fictional monsters. Unless they've already seen the war in action and would like to know more, thus the entire reason this film exists in the first place. But, I digress.

When this film was initially announced as a prequel, I had hoped that Kate Beckinsale would once again reprise her role as the vampire Selene from the first two films. However, at the time Kate was not interested in returning to the series, so actress Rhona Mitra (""Doomsday"") stepped in portraying a new character, Sonja. Although, anyone who has seen these films can attest, clearly Sonja was nothing more than a slightly tweaked Selene. The writers basically took Selene, changed her name and her heritage just a tad, but beyond that kept everything else about the character intact.

Even so, actress Rhona Mitra did a good job with the character. She brought out the same caring and protective side of Sonja as Kate had done with Selene. But the main difference between the two was that Rhona had to imbue Sonja with a very distinct rebellious nature that was constantly at odds with her father and her noble status within the vampire world. Also, Sonja seemed to possess a much more violent nature than her modern day counterpart, most likely a result of not only her upbringing as Viktor's daughter, but also the environment of the Dark Ages in which she lived. After all, those were rough times by any measure.

Alongside Rhona we have two returning cast members from the previous films, Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen. As this film is subtitled ""Rise of the Lycans"", obviously Michael Sheen's character of Lucian is granted the lion's share of the story here. That being said, this prequel film is as much Viktor's story as it is Lucian's, so veteran actor Bill Nighy is given ample time as well. For both characters I found it interesting to see new sides to them or at the very least seeing specific attributes or character traits previously seen in the other films, receive further examination.

With Bill Nighy's performance as Viktor we see even more of the paternal side to this otherwise cold, calculating and undeniably cruel vampire king. We had seen this side to him before in regards to Selene in the previous films, but here we see more glimpses of that side of him as we see his relationship with his very own daughter unfold. Now, this character won't win any awards for Father of the Year by any means, but he did have several touching moments where a softer side was evident, and Bill played these quieter moments to perfection.

As Lucian, Michael Sheen was also allowed to show a much softer side to his character, one that was caring, protective, and yearning for nothing more than to be free and live a happy, content life. However, through various acts of cruelty either directly or indirectly aimed at him by his vampire overlords, we see Lucian slowly lose himself to his anger, until he is ultimately consumed by it. At this point, we see Michael step into the version of Lucian we had grown accustomed to, which proved to be just as entertaining as ever.

Surprisingly though, there were moments where Michael portrayed Lucian as being almost ashamed of his true nature, and that he would willingly give up his birthright to be normal. I don't know if this aspect of the character was written into the script, but I definitely saw glimpses of an internal struggle within Lucian, and found that it made the character all the more intriguing and relatable to the audience.

Lastly, I did have one noteworthy complaint regarding this film, which was that several times the werewolves and lycans looked horribly rendered. I know the budget was lower than that of ""Underworld: Evolution"", but it was higher than the original film, and in both instances I thought the effects used for the wolves (lycan or werewolf) were quite good. Granted, I haven't seen those movies in a little while, but I do plan to watch them again soon, so perhaps I will change my opinion of them at that point.

Still whatever the cause, whether the budget prohibited better quality output or if time constraints hindered the process, the wolves looked out of place much of the time. To the point where there were a few instances that I thought they were utilizing stop-motion animation rather than computer-generated or practical on-set effects (costumes). Although I truly doubt that stop-motion was implemented, that just illustrates how poorly executed some of these sequences looked to me.

All that being said, ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is an entertaining history lesson regarding the war between the vampires and lycans depicted in the ""Underworld"" films. However, the film clearly assumes that the viewer has some prior knowledge of the goings on within the series, and as such does not devote much time in trying to educate newcomers to the saga.

Therefore, I would have to say that as far as prequels go, aimed solely at fans of the series (which is precisely what it is), the film is very good. But, by definition a prequel would now become the first in a series (despite its later release), so in serving as a jumping-on point for newcomers, the film suffers from lack of context in regards to why we should care about these particular characters and their plight. Plus, the cameo at the end of the film featuring Selene would be pointless and a source of confusion to anyone not familiar with the series' characters.

So, in my opinion, if you have never seen the ""Underworld"" films, despite the fact that this is a prequel, I would recommend watching at least the original film first. Then, it's up to you whether or not to continue in the order the films were released by watching the sequel or go back to this one for your history lesson.

3801976,4,B001UJE98E,"`Underworld 3: Rise of the Lycans' is the prequel film in the Underworld trilogy that looks at how the Lycans came to be, how they were intertwined with the Vampires and how they gained their freedom. If you are familiar with the first two films then the style and basic premise will be familiar to you, but this film fleshes out some details and adds a whole new aspect to the story. This features Bill Nighy again as Viktor and Michael Sheen as Lucian and it is funny to see Sheen as a grizzly, werewolf hero when you have seen him as a clean cut politician or as David Frost in past films, but he manages to carry it off with aplomb. The actress who plays Viktor's daughter is a little wooden at times, as are some of the other supporting cast, but this doesn't really affect the story and this film races along at such a pace you don't really get time to be bothered by it. If you a fan of the Underworld films then this will be right up your street and it leads up to the beginning of the first film and if you are new to the series then it can't hurt to start here and then go back to the first film to see how the story develops. All in all this is a good (but not great) horror/monster film that manages to hold your attention for the duration and it is a decent enough way to spend an evening.

The thing that really bothers me is the way the film grain defeats the purpose of having the blu ray copy. I understand film grain is used as a technique often, but on this transfer, it looks at times as if I'm watching a movie from an analog signal and getting bad reception. The regular dvd would be better to have in this case because the severe contrast between the gritty/grainy shots and the clear shots wouldn't be so jarring. It's really quite distracting. The same thing goes for other blu rays I've bought, especially Taken and season 7 of 24. With regular dvd's the use of grainy shots (for artistic purposes) and their alternation with clear shots seems much more natural and does not disrupt the viewing experience as much.",1256947200,6,879,4.569620253164557

Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? Because without the war there would be no action-packed Underworld series. There's suspense, tons of action and a great storyline from the start of this prequel right through Evolution.

The main writers of the franchise, Len Wiseman (who also directed the first two) and Danny McBride are intact for Rise of the Lycans, and that's a key ingredient to a successful prequel or sequel. The director's chair is taken over by FX vet Pat Totoupolis. The fact that this was his first ""real"" directorial try made me a bit skeptical going into Rise of the Lycans. But let me tell you, Totoupolis really pulled it off.

I was also skeptical of Rhona Mitra taking Kate Benkensale's place as the leading lady. But as the movie progresses and concludes it becomes clear that Mitra was perfect for the role.

The series documents a war that has been raging between the Vampires and Lycans for years all because one of the Vampire leaders didn't want his Vampire daughter gettin' busy with a Wolfman. Rise of the Lycans kicks it all off, and even leaves room for a second prequel to Underworld and Evolution.

All in all the whole series is a very well done story that pays to watch from the beginning. Yes, they all have stand-alone potential. But if you haven't already, you'll have more fun if you rent or purchase both Underworld and Underworld Evolution too.

Definitely worth the purchase of putting the whole&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld-Trilogy-Underworld-Underworld-Evolution-Underworld-Rise-of-the-Lycans/dp/B001VLFE76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld Trilogy (Underworld / Underworld: Evolution / Underworld: Rise of the Lycans)</a>&nbsp;into your collection.",1248739200,6,1990,5.444805194805195

3802016,1,B001UJE98E,"Though I enjoyed this movie in theaters, I thought I should warn you that the rendering to Blu-ray was of extremely poor quality.  This movie is very grainy.  I own upwards of 30 Blu-ray movies and had yet to run into something of such poor quality.",1242432000,9,249,4.391304347826087
3802017,2,B001UJE98E,"While I don't think there was anyone that really wanted a second sequel to the Underworld films, let alone a prequel, the fact that Patrick Tatopolulos directed it to be a decent film with great werewolf-err, Lycan action should be commended. Essentially, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is the back story we've seen glimpses of during the first film. Lucian (Michael Sheen) is a cherished slave, forced to kill his own kind, yet is in love with Viktor's (Bill Nighy) daughter Sonja (a perfectly cast Rhona Mitra).

That's basically it plot-wise, simple, effective (in terms of delivering what fans wanted to see) but the overall product has a stale taste to it. First some of the positives were Sheen and Nighy chewing scenery up like a starved homeless men at a buffet. They're both great fun, always are. Like I said before, the Lycans are really cool to see in action, more so here than in the previous films. Perhaps the budget was bigger or the CG got cheaper, but they look great in action. It's probably helped by the dark cinematography (although at times, too dark) and that the director, Patrick Tatopolulos was a former FX man, so his knowledge of FX and staging them are better suited here than what Wiseman did in the first two.

Lycans moves fast, barely slowing down for anything, which is wise because most of this was sort of explained already in the first film through flashbacks. To me, that's one of this film's problems and perhaps it was inevitable, but there's little excitement or interest in the proceedings because it is well covered ground. If you've seen the first film more than once, you'll know about the blood feud between Viktor of the vampires and Lucian of the Lycans, how Selene (Kate Beckinsale)was born, and the birth of the Death Dealers. If you are new to this franchise, well, the film might be better because of that, for me it was stale. The script offered nothing new, it was predictable therefore, hurting it. I know it needed to tie in the first film and offers a clever cameo of a key character at the end, so while the film is decent, it's just an unfortunate case of been-there-done-that.

At least on a creature-feature side, it works.",1242172800,3,2185,4.684895833333333
3802018,4,B001UJE98E,"In 2003, the action-horror film ""Underworld"" starring Kate Beckinsdale as the vampire Selena came out to theaters.  Known for its stylish, Goth presentation and dark, brooding environment, the film would spotlight on the war between the vampires aka ""Death Dealers"" and the human/werewolf hybrids known as ""Lycans"".  Directed by Len Wiseman, the film would spawn a sequel in 2006 ""Underworld: Evolution"".

But the creators of the film wanted to explain how the feud between the Death Dealers and the Lycans started.  Although the first film briefly shown a little bit of that history, due to the rapid and shrinking budget of the first film, the creators were not able to effectively do what they wanted.  And thus the third film, ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"", a prequel to the first two films, was created and released in theaters on January 2009.

Director Len Wiseman who was responsible for the first two films had come off directing the fourth ""Die Hard"" film ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and needing the time to rest,  decided to contribute as a writer and producer for the ""Underworld"" prequel.  Writing the screenplay for ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" was Danny McBride (who played Mason in the first film), Dirk Blackman (who written ""Outlander"") and Howard McCain (who wrote and directed ""Outlander"").

The producers decided to tap into one of their own crew to direct ""Rise of the Lycans"" and thus Patrick Tatopoulos, known for his special effects and creature design for the previous ""Underworld"" films but also for blockbusters such as ""Independence Day"", ""Godzilla"", ""I Am Legend"", ""Silent Hill"" and ""10,000 BC"" (to name a few) was selected to direct the latest film.

The film debuted at #1 in the box office in Jan. 2009 and has grossed nearly $90 million worldwide.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1.  It's important to point out that ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is a film that is featured in primarily blues and blacks.  The film showcases the darkness of that area and if there are any other colors that are utilized, those are reds and the golden and bronze colors.  It is what Tatopoulos wanted and I think that the emphasis on the darker colors brings out the brooding feeling of the land, the castle, the forest, etc.

Picture quality was well done.  I did not see any artifacts, scratches, dust but I did see grain.  Especially in one scene that featured Sonja laying on bed, which was brief but grain/low light noise was noticeable.  But other than that, I just felt that the film utilized blacks effectively.  Red typically are colors that are seen during the most violent or bloodiest of scenes but the color does stand out due to everything being so blue and black.

As for audio quality, ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is presented in English and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and also in Spanish and Portuguese 5.1.

I enjoyed how the action sequences utilizes each channel in my home theater setup.  For one, when hearing the Lycans and the wolves as they run, to when they howl, one thing that audiophiles will notice is the effective use of low frequency bass coming from the subwoofer.  That caught my attention immediately and when my subwoofer is utilized in such a manner, it makes me happy!

But the sounds of spears flying and hitting its victim, hearing the various action sequences constant and fluid and the noise of metal upon metal, slicing and clanging, those are noises that sound crystal clear as it comes out from your front channel speakers.

Dialogue is easily understood and so does the growls of the werewolves.  There's nothing to fault about the audio, audio was well done!

As for subtitles, subtitles provided are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" includes a second disc (digital copy) while the first disc includes special features that are in High Definition for video and for audio, presented in Dolby Surround & Stereo. Spanish and Portuguese subtitles are also included.  Special features included are:

  * Filmmaker Commentary - Commentary features Director Patrick Tatopoulos, three producers and the visual effects supervisor.  I actually found the commentary quite informative and also entertaining.  The guys talk about the choices they had with this film and how they were on a really strict schedule because of talent schedules, they needed to make sure that certain shots were done in 1-2 period.  The guys also talked about how they wanted to do more but they had to stay strictly around the budget they had.  But one of the most important tidbits was the footage from the first ""Underworld"" film which utilized a blonde Sonja and then of course, with this film having a dark haired Sonja. A large majority of the decisions made were done due to lack of money in the budget and I would think that if they were to recut the first ""Underworld"", they can now utilize footage from this this prequel for it.  A very informative commentary that ""Underworld"" fans will no doubt enjoy!
  * Cinechat - A two minute intro to Cinechat and of course, if you have BD-Live, you can chat with a friend or other people while watching the film.
  * Behind the Castle Walls: Picture-in-Picture - While watching the film, you can get a picture-in-picture screen featuring actual shooting of the footage and also interviews with the Director, cast and crew.
  * Lycanthropes Around the World Interactive Map - This is a map featuring Lycanthrope sightings in North America, Europe and Asia.  Personally, I don't know how much of this is factual but I did bring up one about two children who were raised by wolves and when I checked on Google to do a search for the names.  The names came up for Geocities and Lycos sites dedicated to werewolves but no Wikipedia or news sites.  But an interesting, dark and kind of macabre stories of people who believe they were wolves and some that killed and resorted to cannibalism.
  * Underworld: Rise of the Lycans: From Script to Screen - (9:13) Interviews with the producers and the Director in regards to how the script was written in 4 weeks and pretty much these guys who worked on the previous two films knew what they wanted for this prequel.  But most importantly, when the previous Director Len Wiseman was unable to direct due to his involvement with the fourth ""Die Hard"" film ""Live Free or Die Harder"", he became the writer and producer while they tapped Patrick Tatopoulos to direct.  Patrick is well-known for his work in special and creature design and effects for many blockbuster films and because this film utilizes plenty of effects, creatures and knew that this film would emphasize that, how the producers felt that he was perfect to direct this film.
  * The Origin of the the Feud - (19:58) This is the primary featurette in regards to ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" with interviews with the cast and crew.  The cast talk about their characters and what they wanted to bring to their own character and more.
  * Recreating the Dark Ages - (13:01) Interviews with the Director and Production Designer in creating the look and feel of the set, especially the castle and also the werewolves.  How their intention of utilizing blacks and blues but also the reds and bronze/gold.
  * Music Video: ""Deathclub"" By William Control - Fans of the band Aiden, will know lead-vocalist wiL Francis's side project aka William Control and their music video for ""Deathclub"" is included on the special features.
  * PS3 Wallpaper

One thing that I enjoy about the ""Underworld"" films is the sense of its dark, goth style in conjunction with its brooding storyline of the vampires and the werewolves feuding against each other.  ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is the dark ""Romeo & Juliet"" storyline of two lovers from two sides that despite and hate each other.

If there is one thing that people are familiar about the ""Underworld"" films, there is not much time for thorough character development.  These characters may have a brief time of happiness but immediately they are trying to survive or somehow ripped away from any happiness that they seek.  By no means is ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" a happy everlasting storyline.  It's a tragic story about Lucian and Sonja and what intensified the feud between the vampires (Death Dealers) and the Lycans (werewolves/human hybrids).

Lucian's story of being used by Viktor against humans and against his own kind is established but much is not said about Sonja, all the writers want you to know is that aside from being Viktor's daughter, she's madly in love with Lucian.  And that is all you should know.

But I enjoyed this film because it kept things simple.  No convoluted or ridiculous storyline that would go astray or become incomprehensible.  The storyline features characters that are quite interesting.  The Lycan Lucian and his lover, the vampire Sonja and Viktor, the father who will try to deny his daughter or the Lycan baby he raised to become a man any form of pleasure.

Michael Sheen (""Frost/Nixon"", ""Blood Diamond"", ""Underworld: Evolution"", etc.) did a great job as a Lycan who will not let any side tell him that being in love with a vampire is wrong.  It will be interesting as the actor will be part of another popular vampire film ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"".  Sheen plays that passionate but tortured person effectively, especially as his character has undergone so much, but is strong because of his love for Sonja.

Rhona Mitra (""The Practice"", ""Boston Legal"", ""Nip/Tuck"") as Sonja was good, I felt that she could have been used a bit more in the film.  We know that she is a strong vampire but it was more interesting to see her as a compassionate vampire.  It would have been nice to get a little back story of how her relationship with Lucian had started but nevertheless, the focus was not so much on their evolving relationship.  The film quickly establishes her love for Lucian and like Juliet, her father would deny her any happiness.

Which leads me to Bill Nighy (""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"", ""Valkyrie"", etc.) as Viktor.  Nighy does a magnificent job of playing the cold, elder vampire and as he was great in the first two ""Underworld"" films, you do see that compassion that he had felt for his daughter and to see how he changes after he discovers the relationship.

The storyline was well-planned and executed, first time Director Patrick Tatopoulos just had to take that screenplay and make the overall setting believable.  And because of his well-documented experience on special effects and creature designs, he was able to accomplish that gritty, gloomy world of vampires and werewolves, to make sure that the castle of the vampires looked effectively real and the final cut worked for me.

""Underworld"" are films that have never been appreciated by the majority of the film critics but one thing that is consistent is that the intended audience who have enjoyed these films since the beginning have been passionate about it and continue to support it.  For me, I have always enjoyed films about vampires and werewolves and I actually dig the overall presentation and characters of the three films.

With that being said, if you enjoyed the first two films, ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is a prequel that is just worth watching and worth owning on Blu-ray.",1242086400,10,11476,4.85251798561151

It's great to see both sides of the story. The movie also ends so perfectly to follow right into the first movie.",1524096000,,269,4.1923076923076925

The film was good but I felt like I was watching a summer re-run of  Underworld Evolution.  And for some reason, Rona Mitra's character Sonya sure favors Kate  Beckinsale's Character Selene  in physical appearance.  Did anyone else notice this besides me?  Overall, this was a good film and it did fill in a few nagging gaps regarding the relationship between Viktor and Selene.",1502323200,,474,4.7073170731707314
