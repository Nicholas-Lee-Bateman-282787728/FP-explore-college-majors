8323382,5,B001NBAVWC,This is a well written and has great information,1447113600,,48,4.444444444444445
8323383,5,B001NBAVWC,"This is a great video if you want to improve your wood turning skills. Cindy explains every step and explains her choice of tooling, speeds and technique. This is one of the best wood turning videos I've watched. I've made several of Cindy's Fabulous Finial boxes and while they are quite as good as hers, they are still pretty darn good!",1436400000,,338,4.557377049180328
8323384,5,B001NBAVWC,"The dvd is well put together and videoed.  Cindy Drozda makes these projects seem so simple and is really open about how she does things and why.  Looking at the finial box on the cover, gave me pause about trying this project. After watching, my confidence level was increased and I was ready to try the project.",1390953600,,313,4.473684210526316
8323385,4,B001NBAVWC,"Drozda goes way too fast, and she does not really spend a lot of time talking about how to cut and work finials in terms of tool handling, etc. She illustrates by example and explains some things as she goes, but in general she assumes that you are probably an intermediate or advanced turner. Virtually ALL of her tools have been customized by her, so when she uses them, a viewer is not sure of what s/he is seeing or how to replicate it themselves. For example, the heel has been ground off many of her tools -- my detail gouge looks nothing like her detail gouge, and she does not actually SHOW me how she grinds it (what jig is best to use, if I freehand it, how much tolerance for slop do I have before I learn to do it well, etc.) -- and she treats many things very facilely. Safety for example, she never appears waring any safety equipment. But at the end she shows us a respirator and mask and says we should be using them. I just had a spindle come off the lathe and fly at me at 3000+ RPMs (a speed which she turns at) and there is no getting out of the way. I was glad I had on a face shield. By contrast Lyle Jamieson in his bowl turning video talks extensively about safety and models it. He also stops to sharpen his tools every few minutes. Drozda never appears to have to sharpen her tools. Overall, I got a lot of good ideas from the video and it was informative. But it was shorter than I expected and did not have the level of detail that I would have liked.",1384128000,,1479,4.103448275862069
8323386,5,B001NBAVWC,"A very good DVD where the demonstrator talks all the way through the DVD.  you won't get bored. The demonstrations are clear, and she explains her tools that she uses.",1374710400,,167,4.566666666666666
8323387,5,B001NBAVWC,Cindy does a great job of demonstrating how to make the box and finial. She slowly describes how to use the tools and achieve the desired results.,1374278400,,146,4.444444444444445
8323388,5,B001NBAVWC,This DVD is one of the most informative and well produced that I have purchased in a long time. The techniques required to turn a complete finial box project are well explained and close up video is fantastic. Everything is great up to and including the author's tool selection and sharpening process. I would recommend this DVD,1364688000,,328,4.771929824561403
8323389,4,B001NBAVWC,"A great, well done video.  All is good to go but/except for a few little detail things that I assume the artist takes for granted but some of us do-dos aren't familiar with.  Such as:  after measuring with calipers you transfer the size to the piece you are going to turn.  How do you know where to put the arm of the caliper on the butt of the turning piece so it will show you it's CENTERED.
Otherwise, great color and voice over.  The artist sure knows her stuff!!",1310083200,2,467,4.202247191011236
8323390,5,B001NBAVWC,"For anyone thinking about making small hollow forms with finials, this DVD has a lot of info. Well worth it.",1243382400,3,108,4.45
