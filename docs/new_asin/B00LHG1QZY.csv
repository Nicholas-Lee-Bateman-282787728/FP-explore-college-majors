8665974,5,B00LHG1QZY,"The last volume of the G2B series...and yes, you will see a happy ending. After all the memories and episodes they shared together, Ryan remembers fragments of his life as Joaquin...mainly the hurtful parts. Will Chichay and Joaquin end up together? They will...but see the last volume of the series to see how they end up! A highly recommended teleserye that does not have the usual kidnapping/villain dying archtype...you will see a lot of drama, but a lot of love and happiness, too. A true feel good series that will leave you crying out of happiness!",1415836800,,555,4.791666666666667
