7866243,2,6304254377,"The subject matter and price was right, but it was by far the most boring thing I have ever contimplated showing my ninth-grade English students.  For example, the video contains still video shots from the eighties or seventies of Orwell's home complete with the current owners cars in the driveway.  I would only show this to my kids if they neeeded extreme punishment, or if I had to be out for a two week period during our Orwell unit b/c of a family tragedy.",1168819200,,462,4.488095238095238
