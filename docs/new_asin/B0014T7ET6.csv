8256313,4,B0014T7ET6,"I love James Nesbitt and even though his character in this series, Max Raban, makes some pretty bad mistakes, the mistakes seem plausible. Raban has a diagnosed phobia of daylight, thus the title. He's is a journalist trying to make a come back when he unearths a very scary conspiracy. I'll just say that the bad guys in Midnight Man are really evil, and I was able to forgive Max for not fully realizing that sooner. The young actress who plays his daughter, Martha (Romy Irving), is wonderful, and the relationship between Max and Martha struck me as real and unique. Nesbitt and Irving also star in a film called Blessed; they really do have an excellent on-screen rapport. It would be interesting to see a second series of Midnight Man with Nesbitt and Irving as a father/daughter journalist team.",1507420800,,802,4.735714285714286
