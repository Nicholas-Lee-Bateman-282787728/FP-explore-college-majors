I have miss it greatly at least this way I can see the ones that I have enjoyed like Destroying Angel and Garden of Death. And others that I miss like Written in Blood, Badgers Drift and others.

3064135,4,B0011B9W38,"Imagine Saint Mary Mead. Squared.

That about describes the setting of ""Midsomer Murders,"" a morbidly witty British mystery series based on Caroline Graham's novels. And ""Midsomer Murders: The Early Cases"" brings together the first eighteen cases in this cozy, dark little county, making up most of the first four seasons.

In the pilot episode, an elderly spinster is is hunting for orchids when she comes across something strange in the woods -- and soon she's found dead, with a broken neck. Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) is persuaded to investigate further, and soon he discovers that there's something far nastier coming up -- more bloody killings, secret incest, and an old forgotten crime.

""The Killings in Badger's Grift"" is perhaps the clumsiest episode of the series, with some horribly over-the-top acting and a weird dream sequence. But the writers get their footing with ""Written in Blood,"" about a double murder rooted in the shared past of two middle-aged men -- one a bestselling novelist.

From there on, Barnaby and his assistant, Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey), are forced to investigate all sorts of crimes -- obviously each episode has a murder, but there's plenty of adultery, theft, kidnapping, insanity and ""cold cases"" that are connected to current murders.

And they have to deal with some very strange crimes -- a strangled cigarette model, a New Age lodge, snotty aristocrats, a local sexpot's kidnapping (or not), a trophy wife murdered with a cricket bat, mysterious tramps, nursing home murders, a thief killed by a pitchfork, a haunted museum, toxic mushrooms, crop circles, adulterous mailmen, and a wedding that is disrupted when the groom's father is hoisted out of a well.

Honestly, I think Miss Marple would feel right at home  -- such a pretty, homey, sunshiney place, full of kindly spinsters and genial aristocrats. The whole thing is set in the various villages of Midsomer County, which is picturesque, lush, and full of farms, cute little English villages and cottages.

So of course, there are gruesome murders, plotting and tawdry secrets hidden in every corner; several spill out in every episode, and only some of them have to do with the main murder. But the writers keep a funny edge in the stories, such as Barnaby being shadowed by his daughter's boyfriend, or certain lines when off duty (""You're just jealous because I have a coconut and you haven't!"").

And these cops are pretty believable detectives. John Nettles is absolutely wonderful as the kindly, middle-aged cop with a brain like stainless steel, whose nice sedate family is a relief from all the Midsomer weirdos. And Daniel Casey is solid as his younger, brasher assistant.

Most of the villagers are played by excellent actors as well, no matter how weird their characters are. Grumpy mediums, mad vicars and nasty little schoolboys are only a few, with Emily Mortimer and Jonathan Firth playing one-off roles. And keep an eye out for Orlando Bloom as a sneering young thief in one of these episodes -- he's not only great at being nasty, but he has a priceless death scene.

""Midsomer Murders: The Early Cases"" is a big, solidly-written chunk of British coziness, spanning almost four seasons. And it has murder and scandal in every episode.",1198972800,172,3287,5.0349907918968695

3064168,5,B0011B9W38,"Discovered the first 13 series were available as five collected boxed sets, starting with this one, and the fifth being Barnaby's Last Cases. They are a very good value compared to acquiring as individual series. My husband and I are up to series 10/11, the 4th boxed set. Only complaint is up to series 10, there have been two episodes per disk. Starting with this fourth box set, only one episode per disk.

SPOILER!  The series early years has more murders per episode. As John Nettles stated on a DVD interview, they tried to slow down the depopulation of Midsomer as the series progressed. One of our very favorite edisodes is in series 9, titled ""Four Funerals and a Wedding"" an obvious play on the title of a romantic comedy.

If you are a fan of British tv, almost every story has familiar faces, making guest appearances.",1500336000,3,830,4.63265306122449

3064174,4,B0011B9W38,"As a long time Midsomer Murders fan, I did not think it could go this long without faltering. The entireity of the series is exceptionally good and entertaining. New characters are introduced, and it did not take long to welcome them. It made the last of the series a little more exciting. I was given this series from a pal in the UK.

Seargeant Jones has left Midsomer, and we meet DS Charlie Nelson. He is young with city experience and wonders if country life will suit him. However, he is more than willing to give it a try. Neil Dudgeon continues to play John Barnaby, and the mysteries and murders continue. We meet Barbaby's wife, and they are expecting a baby. One of the episodes that takes place in Denmark, is near the birth, and Barnaby wonders if he should take the trip. This episode was one of my favorites. It incorporated some of the characters from Borgen, one of my favorite series. The other episodes are very well done, and the last episode, well..wait and see.

3064193,5,B0011B9W38,Since I have a slight hearing loss and always use the closed caption feature on my TV it was frustrating to watch the early shows of this series.  Because of the English accents it was sometimes hard for me to understand what was being said and so I would have to rewind and turn up the volume. By having to do this it made it hard to fully enjoy watching the shows. I was very happy to see that Amazon offered the reissue of the series with subtitles. After watching all of the DVD's I then donated them to my local library. They were thankful for the donation because other Patrons had also complained about no subtitles for the early shows.,1475625600,2,643,4.31404958677686

The many ""sets"" they have produced don't seem to have been made in chronological order, which makes this particular collection more appealing to me:  it is made up of the best of the early seasons, and seems to be more or less in the correct order.  I hope they produce more like this one.

Maybe it was just me, but with the original set sent, and with the replacement set as well I could not play the second episode that was listed on each separate DVD. The menu on each disc stated 2 episodes and the jacket listed 2 episodes on each disc, but in each case I was only able to access the first episode listed.

This means the buyer is getting only half of what they are paying money for.  Too bad, because ""Tom Barnaby, the last cases' is properly labeled and packaged.",1408665600,17,618,4.318965517241379

I am surprised (pleasantly, mind you) that the English can get away with so much more than we can here in the United States which is why I refuse to really watch many American shows. John Nettles does a fantastic job with the series and his sidekick, Sgt Troy is not likable at first, but he really begins to grow on you after a bit.

3064297,5,B0011B9W38,"ALWAYS GOOD. NOW WITH SUBTITLES.
SEE JOHN NETTLES BUILD THIS SHOW INTO IT'S GREATNESS. He is in all episodes, of course.
Midsomer Murders continues with new shows after it's debut in 1997. Over 60 episodes and growing. Why? Because it is TOP British crime drama, with a twist of humor and romance. And then there is the awesome footage of British village life, as spectacular as any English documentary/travel DVD. The characters are believable, and the crime solving is reasonable, although complex enough for the most avid of mystery fans. It helped to begin with a world-class author's books (Caroline Graham) and 6 early screenplays by none other than Anthony Horowitz (Foyle's War, Poirot, Robin of Sherwood). All six of Horowitz screenplays are included in this set.

His ""Judgment Day"" is my favorite of the earliest 18 feature length episodes in this set. Lots of laughs mixed in. A village children's orchestra, practicing for the fete, appears playing the show's theme song. But like tradition, this is multiple murder in Midsomer County, 5 in this episode. The multiple murder show was an immediate characteristic of this series, and continues to current episodes.
This set is the best way to get started with Midsomer Murders. Then move on to the second collection set ""Midsomer Murders: Barnaby's Casebook"" which can then be followed by the newest collection set of ""Midsomer Murders: Village Case Files.""

I have never watched an episode that was not a 5-star production. Speaking of stars, every British TV & film star now wants to be a guest star on this show. Guest stars began in the beginning, and are a part of what makes this such a delightful series. Here's a PARTIAL list only from this Early Cases Collection:
Episode 1 Emily Mortimer (Coming Home, Lovely & Amazing); Elizabeth Spriggs (Sense & Sensibility)
2 Anna Massey (Tess of D'Urbervilles; Machinist), Annabelle Apsion (Shameless)
3 Angela Pleasence (September, Barchester Chronicles, Mansfield Park)
6 Richard Briers (Monarch of the Glen); Julian Wadham (Dance to the Music of Time, English Patient)
9 Phyllida Law (mother of Emma Thompson); Honeysuckle Weeks (Foyle's War)
10 James Bolam (Beiderbeck X 2)
12 Orlando Bloom (Troy, Pirates of Caribbean,Lord of the Rings)
13 Prunella Scales (Mapp & Lucia, Fawlty Towers)
17 Ian McNeice (Doc Martin)
18 Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones, Kingdom), Gilliam Kearney (Forsyte Saga)

The shows are not rated but in this collection there is a bare female chest, several male backsides exposed, and graphic murder victim scenes, although usually quick. Some content is definitely, in my own opinion, for teenage and above. But you can also prepare yourself for some very tender moments. Or a belly laugh. It has it all.",1387584000,30,2734,5.098214285714286
3064298,5,B0011B9W38,"I just finished watching the last episode of the early cases.  This is a superior show with top notch acting.  Gavin Troy is no suck up to Barnaby.  He says what he thinks and his expressions when he meets abnormal characters are priceless.  I had planned on buying the other sets  of Midsommer Murders and try Murdoch's Mysteries but have noticed that the prices have shot up dramatically on these and other shows including ones I bought at a much better price.  I still have plenty of other mystery series that I have bought and will finish watching them.  When through, I will watch again such pure delights as Rumpole of the Bailey, Inspector Lewis, Foyle's War, Pie in the Sky, Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot, Rosemary and Thyme, Frost and several others.

3064304,5,B0011B9W38,"Tom Barnaby is a clever, dogged detective and a very handsome man as well. I just love this series so much! Almost all of the episodes are clever and have some surprising twist to them. As an American, it is fun to see English villages with their beautiful gardens too. (Of course, if all of those murders really happened in these fictional English villages, Midsomer would probably be the per-capita murder capital of England!) Detective Barnaby actually makes jokes about this fact in a little ""wink"" to the audience. I love Barnaby's wife Joyce and all of her snarky comments to her husband. Pretty accurate portrayal of a long marriage, I think. This is just a fun series, and I always look forward to having a new episode to watch.",1375401600,,736,4.6692307692307695

3064307,5,B0011B9W38,"We first became acquainted with Midsomer Murders by watching episodes on PBS.  Deputy Chief Inspector Barnaby, his young sidekick and the colorful, often eccentric characters who populate these stories were so interesting and engaging that we decided to invest in this volume of DVDs, and we've had hours of fun watching older episodes that haven't yet made it to PBS.  This show has been running on the BBC for 15 years or more, so there's little danger that you'll be paying for episodes you've already seen on TV.  The story lines are full of red herrings and interesting plot twists, and the acting is terrific across the board.  Highly recommended",1373760000,,652,4.9

3064309,5,B0011B9W38,"I can't even imagine any other person playing the character of Barneby.  John Nettles plays this detective in such a way as to draw you in and make you love him from the get-go.  The writer has done a MARVELOUS job so even people who don't have law enforcement in their families can truly appreciate and understand that being a cop IS a family affair!  Vacations, dates, special events, it doesn't matter - plans are NEVER really guaranteed when you have a copy in the family, and this series demonstrates this brilliantly....in spades!  AND, the way Nettles' character GETS to the truth and SOLVES the crimes....what would he do without his wife, Joyce?!  The best part about this for me, though, is that it shows that good...really good....television does not need to be overtly violent or full of vulgarity.  You could easily watch this with your pre-teen and teenage kids and not be embarrassed or uncomfortable about anything that is said or seen on the screen.

Each episode is set in a different quaint English village with ivy covered cottages, beautiful gardens and the occasional jaw-dropping country manor!

3064315,5,B0011B9W38,"Have been a fan of Midsomer Murders, after viewing 2 seasons in UK. Each episode introduces new and fascinating characters, and the recurring ones become old friends very quickly. The villages where the stories are filmed are a wonderful added attraction to the mysteries- it's like taking a tour of British countryside. Each time I replay an episode I enjoy it more and more. Combining 4 series into one collection was an excellent idea and a cost effective means of enjoying great mysteries. Expect to purchase more collections in the future.",1367366400,2,544,4.989010989010989

3064327,4,B0011B9W38,"These are nice stories.  One could argue that there is an unnatural amount of mayhem in the rural areas, and that certainly is true.  Some of the murders are kind of ruthless and gory.  It is, however, a murder mystery series, and in the end you sacrifice the reality of nice sane rural people and instead find them willing to murder their neighbors in the most hideous manner over the most trivial thing.  Let's be clear - this is not just a murder mystery, it's a comedy (albeit dry British comedy).  When you keep that in mind, it's very funny and still a great whodunnit.  DCI Barnaby, when speaking to his wife who wants to move to Midsomer, says something like, ""I go to work and see kidnappings, blackmail, and murder - why would I want to live there?""  In the end, she sees why not to live there and abandons the idea.  The cost of this might seem high, but each episode is 100 minutes long and there are 19 episodes.  in the end, that's quite a bargain.  My major problem with this set is that there is absolutely no closed captioning, and my parents who enjoy this a lot have a hard time hearing the dialog.  Given DVD production, it is really unforgivable that any discs sold are not captioned well, let alone not at all.",1326844800,4,1232,4.359649122807017
3064328,5,B0011B9W38,"Mayhem lurks amongst scary chintz and the bucolic English countryside. Midsomer is a perilous place, unrivaled in its menace. Yet its citizens keep being replenished, somehow there is never a shortage of potential maniacs and victims. To repeat, Barnaby, we hardly knew ye. These are the Full Monty, as never seen on American television. Seeing the real thing, my addled wife can't stop calling you Barnabas, as we've watched so much ""Dark Shadows."" Or perhaps it's your added swagger and dark wit. These disks reveal a Midsomer we never viewed before. When aired here, they were abbreviated to accommodate room for commercials. Now, we get the uncut, well-seasoned bangers & mash of Barnaby's acerbic personality, English slang from Troy, and complete plot lines; no narrative is missing. What a treat! We finally understand why this series is such an international hit of great duration. The only clunker is ""Destroying Angel,"" with too many puppets and (even for Midsomer) unlikely events, and a lack of humor between our favorite coppers. We relate to Barnaby's disdain for the insufferable clothing-clerk, preferring the excellent Marks 'n Sparks too (decade-old slacks from there still look good).

Beware especially the residents of Badger's Drift, rife with hidden agendas, and well upholstered, over-chintzed women bearing tea. Settle down for a virtual escape to a bucolic English countryside strewn with mayhem. This long haul is best accompanied by plenty of goodies, as Midsomer delights in torturing its susceptible audience by lingering on tea-trays laden with countless delicacies, and scrumptious looking roasts with taters 'n gravy, sausages, pudding, well, you get the picture.

A note on the fine packaging: I'd been worried about ordering this repackaging of the first four boxed sets, due to vociferous complaints by several reviewers here. They led me to believe that the packaging consisted of cardboard envelopes for the disks or worse, like ""Avatar."" Don't worry. The packaging is good, consisting of multiple plastic holders for the disks within a box. This common storage for longer series works just fine; no problem whatsoever.

I mainly bought this so my mom could see them.
  The newer ones are just as good, although there are a few clinkers like with any show, they held up throughout their long run.  If you are a British Murder Mystery fan like me I suggest also checking out 'Inspector Lynley', 'The Last Detective', 'Poirot' with David Suchet, and especially 'Foyles War'.

3064333,4,B0011B9W38,"I'm giving this item three stars -- the average of five stars for content, one star for packaging. Expect to break at least one disk removing it from the holder.

I've watched Midsomer Murders for years, since they ran on A&E and the Biography Channel. This collection includes the best episodes, in my opinion, from the early seasons. Most are based on the Caroline Graham novels, not original scripts. If you like English village murder mysteries, these are great.

However, the packaging is atrocious: The disk holders hang on to the center hole like grim death, and every time I remove a disk I expect it to break. Finally, one did, even though I was babying it while taking it out -- the mounting catch was so tight the disk simply snapped along a radius before it released. Fortunately there's just one episode per disc.

Just a warning. Don't try to pop the disc out like you should be able to. You'll end up in splitsville.

UPDATE (02/25/2011)-- ONE MORE STAR: I complained to Acorn Media, manufacturers of the Midsomer DVDs, about the broken disc and they replaced it right away! The new disc arrived in today's mail. Who says customer service is dead? So now I've bumped my rating to four stars.",1298160000,18,1206,4.647887323943662

It is a wonderful series and I'm sorry I can only sample it when a PBS happens to schedule them.  Any information anyone has would be appreciated.

3064336,5,B0011B9W38,"Midsomer Murders continues with new shows after it's debut in 1997. Over 60 episodes and growing. Why? Because it is TOP British crime drama, with a twist of humor and romance. And then there is the awesome footage of British village life, as spectacular as any English documentary/travel DVD. The characters are believable, and the crime solving is reasonable, although complex enough for the most avid of mystery fans. It helped to begin with a world-class author's books (Caroline Graham) and 6 early screenplays by none other than Anthony Horowitz (Foyle's War, Poirot, Robin of Sherwood). All six of Horowitz screenplays are included in this set.

His ""Judgment Day"" is my favorite of the earliest 18 feature length episodes in this set. Lots of laughs mixed in. A village children's orchestra, practicing for the fete, appears playing the show's theme song. But like tradition, this is multiple murder in Midsomer County, 5 in this episode. The multiple murder show was an immediate characteristic of this series, and continues to current episodes.
This set is the best way to get started with Midsomer Murders. Then move on to the second collection set ""Midsomer Murders: Barnaby's Casebook"" which can then be followed by the newest collection set of ""Midsomer Murders: Village Case Files.""

I have never watched an episode that was not a 5-star production. Speaking of stars, every British TV & film star now wants to be a guest star on this show. Guest stars began in the beginning, and are a part of what makes this such a delightful series. Here's a PARTIAL list only from this Early Cases Collection:
Episode 1 Emily Mortimer (Coming Home, Lovely & Amazing); Elizabeth Spriggs (Sense & Sensibility)
2 Anna Massey (Tess of D'Urbervilles; Machinist), Annabelle Apsion (Shameless)
3 Angela Pleasence (September, Barchester Chronicles, Mansfield Park)
6 Richard Briers (Monarch of the Glen); Julian Wadham (Dance to the Music of Time, English Patient)
9 Phyllida Law (mother of Emma Thompson); Honeysuckle Weeks (Foyle's War)
10 James Bolam (Beiderbeck X 2)
12 Orlando Bloom (Troy, Pirates of Caribbean,Lord of the Rings)
13 Prunella Scales (Mapp & Lucia, Fawlty Towers)
17 Ian McNeice (Doc Martin)
18 Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones, Kingdom), Gilliam Kearney (Forsyte Saga)

The shows are not rated but in this collection there is a bare female chest, several male backsides exposed, and graphic murder victim scenes, although usually quick. Some content is definitely, in my own opinion, for teenage and above. But you can also prepare yourself for some very tender moments. Or a belly laugh. It has it all. The only mark against it is the fact that subtitles had not been added at this point in the history of Midsomer Murder DVDs, they come later in other sets.

The length of the show, a yet continuing series, is recommendation enough for the TV series mystery viewer. Personally, I'm getting quite close now to owning every episode available on DVD. Good, good stuff. A hit on British and American TV, A&E and Biography Channel. Will it ever end? Hopefully not.",1285459200,2,3072,5.041338582677166

They are not like CSI's or Bone's, but more along the line of Columbo or the newer version of The CLOSER.  They are British Mysteries and center around a Chief Inspector in the Midlands of England.

3064350,5,B0011B9W38,"Midsomer Murders - the Early Cases comprises the first eighteen cases of this popular series, set in the quaint little villages, moldering manor houses and cottage real-estate-to-die-for of a mythical English county. The series starts off being based on the best-selling mysteries of Caroline Graham; intricate and atmospheric, set in the modern British countryside. Classical English cozies with a wickedly modern twist; the sleuth is not Miss Marple, with a penchant for knitting and uncovering evil over the teacups and under the thatched roofs, but by a solid professional; the admirably decent Inspector Barnaby and his sidekick, Sgt Troy.

This series is the perfect cuppa for anyone who loves a certain flavor of Brit-TV. My daughter and I savored our watching of this series like we would savor consumption of a box of designer chocolates: one and a time and relishing every delicious nibble, from the misty green landscapes to the real-estate ad visions of perfection in the various locations. Never did the English countryside look so gorgeous... and never did the intrusion of bloody murder seem so perverse. You see it all if you watch carefully  in a small village, as Miss Marple so cogently observed - every sort of wickedness and perversion, every sort of kink, personal, sexual, financial, from voyeurism to incest, country dancing and an unseemly interest in Punch and Judy.

One of the charming counter-points to all of this professionally observed mayhem  is Inspector Barnaby's wryly realistic outlook, as well as his perfectly normal and happy family life; his wife is loving and a perfectly awful cook, his daughter Cully is an actress - providing a knowledgeable entry into all sorts of small-village shenanigans, as well as insight into a some different and amazingly peculiar cases. And how very pleasant it is to have a detective hero who is not a bundle of angst and dysfunction, who has a loving and satisfactory family life. These days that counts as a shockingly novel and original twist.

The best of the extras to this set is a documentary ""Super Sleuths"" that takes a long look at the first decade of the long-running series, including interviews with stars (regular and guest variety), producers, TV writers as well as Caroline Graham, who originated the series with seven very good novels. Practically every top-flight and well-known British actor has made a guest appearance in this series;  watch for Orlando Bloom, who comes to a sticky end in one episode.",1241308800,6,2495,5.0880195599022

Having already read all the Agatha Christies, I decided to try Midsomer Murders and was absolutely delighted with all the episodes. In order to really enjoy them, of course, it is first necessary to suspend belief in the premise that there could be so many murders in one sedate British county (although if you consider each episode separately, it is perhaps not so unbelievable that a particular murder might have occurred in that one venue.) In any case, I consider the plots to be secondary to the ambience, the settings, the characters, and window on the quintessence of British life in the countryside and small villages. (I must confess to also sometimes losing track of some of the characters, and sometimes wish the scene changes were not quite so abrupt). But once you have watched several edpisodes, you can not help but become  attached to the main characters--Barnaby, his wife, daugter, Troy, etc. I now consider myself a hopeless Midsommer addict, and plan to watch all the episodes with the hope its producers will not only hit the magic 100, but exceed it. I read where Nettles has said he'll keep playing Barnaby until the audience plays out, which I can not imagine happening anytime soon.

I wasn't disappointed!  We have been watching an episode per night; each one is an hour and 40 minutes long.  For me, it's the perfect way to relax on a cold winter night.  Love the way Inspector Barnaby ties it all together for you at the end.  The suspects as well as non-suspects in the Midsomer villages are all just a little wierd, adding to the overall charm and suspense of these stories.  Mr. Nettles (Inspector Barnaby) is kind of the English Columbo and Gavin Troy is the perfect foil to the seasoned Inspector.  I intend to eventually, finances permitting, purchase all of these.

These actors are much more believeable because they could be your neighbor, your co-worker, family, etc.  These episodes are about 2 hours in length and make for a nice diversion in the winter evening if you enjoy a good ""whodunit"".

Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby and his right hand DS Gavin Troy are the perfect crime fighting team  and make watching a delight. The often multiple killings, lies, secrets, blackmail, an even normal village life make this series so enjoyable.

When we saw this box set of the first 18 early cases it was the perfect choice!  While not having to be watching in any particular order it is helpful to sometimes follow along the natural progression of the series, the cases and Barnaby's family life. If you love mysteries...especially British mysteries, you really MUST give these wonderful shows a chance. The acting is superb, the settings perfection, and the characters simply amusing.

3064367,5,B0011B9W38,"I love this droll, darkly humorous series set in the fictional UK county of Midsomer.  Finally, the initial 18 episodes are available in the order they were first broadcast in the UK.  What a treat!

There's something cozy about the madness behind the rustic hedges and lush landscape of this wonderful old-school murder mystery series.  Midsomer is a contained world populated with slightly inbred middle-class eccentrics.  The colorful villagers -- vicars, birdwatchers and cricket players mingle with -- and in some cases are -- murderers of great, if flawed, creativity.

Especially delicious are the first five titles taken directly from the novels of Caroline Graham. I have enjoyed ""Killings At Badger's Drift,"" ""Written In Blood,"" and ""Death Of A  Hollow Man"" multiple times.

Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettle) brings a reasoned mature calm to the lurking menace of the deceptively heavenly, stately environs.  A decent and normal man who represents the best of his breed.  And make no mistake, this series is very much about breeding.  Barnaby's sidekick DS Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) is the perfect youthful -- sometimes naive, sometimes intuitive, sometimes brash -- balance to the proceedings.

This kind of closed story-telling, in which killings are center stage and around which all the action takes place, is reassuring in a world that often reflects far harsher realities.  It's reassuring because there is closure and all is put in order and justice on some level is meted out.  At least for the time-being.

The production is top notch all round.  Colorful minor characters abound -- often stars in the making (see Orlando Bloom and others in early episodes).

What sets this apart for me, is the balance of Barnaby's private life with the horrors of his professional life.  It seems he's learned a lesson from his work and that is to appreciate even the minor irritations of domestic bliss and fatherhood, like his wife's penchant for experimental culinary experimentations and his daughter's thespian aspirations.  Very Hitchcockian English humor.

There are 18 episodes.  The smooth transition from Graham's novels to episodes based on her characters is seamless and sometimes just as diabolically clever.

A lot of care has gone into the creation and maintenance of this terrific series.  There are a total of 30 hours of delectably dastardly doings in this package as well as ""Super Sleuths,"" a fascinating bonus documentary  that takes a look at the first decade of ""Midsomer Murders.""

If classic murder mysteries are your cup of tea, don't miss this timeless set.

Beautiful packaging (the shadow of an axe murderer is on the outer box, and on the inner sleeve he's gone!) and the plastic ""page fold"" multiple disc case is the best I've seen.

Highest recommendation.",1207872000,72,2811,5.147902869757174

3298632,4,B0011B9W38,"Imagine Saint Mary Mead. Squared.

That about describes the setting of ""Midsomer Murders,"" a morbidly witty British mystery series based on Caroline Graham's novels. And ""Midsomer Murders: The Early Cases"" brings together the first eighteen cases in this cozy, dark little county, making up most of the first four seasons.

In the pilot episode, an elderly spinster is is hunting for orchids when she comes across something strange in the woods -- and soon she's found dead, with a broken neck. Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) is persuaded to investigate further, and soon he discovers that there's something far nastier coming up -- more bloody killings, secret incest, and an old forgotten crime.

""The Killings in Badger's Grift"" is perhaps the clumsiest episode of the series, with some horribly over-the-top acting and a weird dream sequence. But the writers get their footing with ""Written in Blood,"" about a double murder rooted in the shared past of two middle-aged men -- one a bestselling novelist.

From there on, Barnaby and his assistant, Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey), are forced to investigate all sorts of crimes -- obviously each episode has a murder, but there's plenty of adultery, theft, kidnapping, insanity and ""cold cases"" that are connected to current murders.

And they have to deal with some very strange crimes -- a strangled cigarette model, a New Age lodge, snotty aristocrats, a local sexpot's kidnapping (or not), a trophy wife murdered with a cricket bat, mysterious tramps, nursing home murders, a thief killed by a pitchfork, a haunted museum, toxic mushrooms, crop circles, adulterous mailmen, and a wedding that is disrupted when the groom's father is hoisted out of a well.

Honestly, I think Miss Marple would feel right at home  -- such a pretty, homey, sunshiney place, full of kindly spinsters and genial aristocrats. The whole thing is set in the various villages of Midsomer County, which is picturesque, lush, and full of farms, cute little English villages and cottages.

So of course, there are gruesome murders, plotting and tawdry secrets hidden in every corner; several spill out in every episode, and only some of them have to do with the main murder. But the writers keep a funny edge in the stories, such as Barnaby being shadowed by his daughter's boyfriend, or certain lines when off duty (""You're just jealous because I have a coconut and you haven't!"").

And these cops are pretty believable detectives. John Nettles is absolutely wonderful as the kindly, middle-aged cop with a brain like stainless steel, whose nice sedate family is a relief from all the Midsomer weirdos. And Daniel Casey is solid as his younger, brasher assistant.

Most of the villagers are played by excellent actors as well, no matter how weird their characters are. Grumpy mediums, mad vicars and nasty little schoolboys are only a few, with Emily Mortimer and Jonathan Firth playing one-off roles. And keep an eye out for Orlando Bloom as a sneering young thief in one of these episodes -- he's not only great at being nasty, but he has a priceless death scene.

""Midsomer Murders: The Early Cases"" is a big, solidly-written chunk of British coziness, spanning almost four seasons. And it has murder and scandal in every episode.",1198972800,172,3287,5.0349907918968695

Only complaint is up to series 10, there have been two episodes per disk. Starting with this fourth box set, only one episode per disk.

SPOILER!  The series early years has more murders per episode. As John Nettles stated on a DVD interview, they tried to slow down the depopulation of Midsomer as the series progressed. One of our very favorite edisodes is in series 9, titled ""Four Funerals and a Wedding"" an obvious play on the title of a romantic comedy.

New characters are introduced, and it did not take long to welcome them. It made the last of the series a little more exciting. I was given this series from a pal in the UK.

Seargeant Jones has left Midsomer, and we meet DS Charlie Nelson. He is young with city experience and wonders if country life will suit him. However, he is more than willing to give it a try. Neil Dudgeon continues to play John Barnaby, and the mysteries and murders continue. We meet Barbaby's wife, and they are expecting a baby. One of the episodes that takes place in Denmark, is near the birth, and Barnaby wonders if he should take the trip. This episode was one of my favorites. It incorporated some of the characters from Borgen, one of my favorite series. The other episodes are very well done, and the last episode, well..wait and see.

The menu on each disc stated 2 episodes and the jacket listed 2 episodes on each disc, but in each case I was only able to access the first episode listed.

This means the buyer is getting only half of what they are paying money for.  Too bad, because ""Tom Barnaby, the last cases' is properly labeled and packaged.",1408665600,17,618,4.318965517241379

I am surprised (pleasantly, mind you) that the English can get away with so much more than we can here in the United States which is why I refuse to really watch many American shows. John Nettles does a fantastic job with the series and his sidekick, Sgt Troy is not likable at first, but he really begins to grow on you after a bit.

3298794,5,B0011B9W38,"ALWAYS GOOD. NOW WITH SUBTITLES.
SEE JOHN NETTLES BUILD THIS SHOW INTO IT'S GREATNESS. He is in all episodes, of course.
Midsomer Murders continues with new shows after it's debut in 1997. Over 60 episodes and growing. Why? Because it is TOP British crime drama, with a twist of humor and romance. And then there is the awesome footage of British village life, as spectacular as any English documentary/travel DVD. The characters are believable, and the crime solving is reasonable, although complex enough for the most avid of mystery fans. It helped to begin with a world-class author's books (Caroline Graham) and 6 early screenplays by none other than Anthony Horowitz (Foyle's War, Poirot, Robin of Sherwood). All six of Horowitz screenplays are included in this set.

His ""Judgment Day"" is my favorite of the earliest 18 feature length episodes in this set. Lots of laughs mixed in. A village children's orchestra, practicing for the fete, appears playing the show's theme song. But like tradition, this is multiple murder in Midsomer County, 5 in this episode. The multiple murder show was an immediate characteristic of this series, and continues to current episodes.
This set is the best way to get started with Midsomer Murders. Then move on to the second collection set ""Midsomer Murders: Barnaby's Casebook"" which can then be followed by the newest collection set of ""Midsomer Murders: Village Case Files.""

I have never watched an episode that was not a 5-star production. Speaking of stars, every British TV & film star now wants to be a guest star on this show. Guest stars began in the beginning, and are a part of what makes this such a delightful series. Here's a PARTIAL list only from this Early Cases Collection:
Episode 1 Emily Mortimer (Coming Home, Lovely & Amazing); Elizabeth Spriggs (Sense & Sensibility)
2 Anna Massey (Tess of D'Urbervilles; Machinist), Annabelle Apsion (Shameless)
3 Angela Pleasence (September, Barchester Chronicles, Mansfield Park)
6 Richard Briers (Monarch of the Glen); Julian Wadham (Dance to the Music of Time, English Patient)
9 Phyllida Law (mother of Emma Thompson); Honeysuckle Weeks (Foyle's War)
10 James Bolam (Beiderbeck X 2)
12 Orlando Bloom (Troy, Pirates of Caribbean,Lord of the Rings)
13 Prunella Scales (Mapp & Lucia, Fawlty Towers)
17 Ian McNeice (Doc Martin)
18 Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones, Kingdom), Gilliam Kearney (Forsyte Saga)

The shows are not rated but in this collection there is a bare female chest, several male backsides exposed, and graphic murder victim scenes, although usually quick. Some content is definitely, in my own opinion, for teenage and above. But you can also prepare yourself for some very tender moments. Or a belly laugh. It has it all.",1387584000,30,2734,5.098214285714286

Almost all of the episodes are clever and have some surprising twist to them. As an American, it is fun to see English villages with their beautiful gardens too. (Of course, if all of those murders really happened in these fictional English villages, Midsomer would probably be the per-capita murder capital of England!) Detective Barnaby actually makes jokes about this fact in a little ""wink"" to the audience. I love Barnaby's wife Joyce and all of her snarky comments to her husband. Pretty accurate portrayal of a long marriage, I think. This is just a fun series, and I always look forward to having a new episode to watch.",1375401600,,736,4.6692307692307695

Deputy Chief Inspector Barnaby, his young sidekick and the colorful, often eccentric characters who populate these stories were so interesting and engaging that we decided to invest in this volume of DVDs, and we've had hours of fun watching older episodes that haven't yet made it to PBS.  This show has been running on the BBC for 15 years or more, so there's little danger that you'll be paying for episodes you've already seen on TV.

John Nettles plays this detective in such a way as to draw you in and make you love him from the get-go.  The writer has done a MARVELOUS job so even people who don't have law enforcement in their families can truly appreciate and understand that being a cop IS a family affair!  Vacations, dates, special events, it doesn't matter - plans are NEVER really guaranteed when you have a copy in the family, and this series demonstrates this brilliantly....in spades!  AND, the way Nettles' character GETS to the truth and SOLVES the crimes....what would he do without his wife, Joyce?!  The best part about this for me, though, is that it shows that good...really good....television does not need to be overtly violent or full of vulgarity.  You could easily watch this with your pre-teen and teenage kids and not be embarrassed or uncomfortable about anything that is said or seen on the screen.

3298824,4,B0011B9W38,"These are nice stories.  One could argue that there is an unnatural amount of mayhem in the rural areas, and that certainly is true.  Some of the murders are kind of ruthless and gory.  It is, however, a murder mystery series, and in the end you sacrifice the reality of nice sane rural people and instead find them willing to murder their neighbors in the most hideous manner over the most trivial thing.  Let's be clear - this is not just a murder mystery, it's a comedy (albeit dry British comedy).  When you keep that in mind, it's very funny and still a great whodunnit.  DCI Barnaby, when speaking to his wife who wants to move to Midsomer, says something like, ""I go to work and see kidnappings, blackmail, and murder - why would I want to live there?""  In the end, she sees why not to live there and abandons the idea.  The cost of this might seem high, but each episode is 100 minutes long and there are 19 episodes.  in the end, that's quite a bargain.  My major problem with this set is that there is absolutely no closed captioning, and my parents who enjoy this a lot have a hard time hearing the dialog.  Given DVD production, it is really unforgivable that any discs sold are not captioned well, let alone not at all.",1326844800,4,1232,4.359649122807017
3298825,5,B0011B9W38,"Mayhem lurks amongst scary chintz and the bucolic English countryside. Midsomer is a perilous place, unrivaled in its menace. Yet its citizens keep being replenished, somehow there is never a shortage of potential maniacs and victims. To repeat, Barnaby, we hardly knew ye. These are the Full Monty, as never seen on American television. Seeing the real thing, my addled wife can't stop calling you Barnabas, as we've watched so much ""Dark Shadows."" Or perhaps it's your added swagger and dark wit. These disks reveal a Midsomer we never viewed before. When aired here, they were abbreviated to accommodate room for commercials. Now, we get the uncut, well-seasoned bangers & mash of Barnaby's acerbic personality, English slang from Troy, and complete plot lines; no narrative is missing. What a treat! We finally understand why this series is such an international hit of great duration. The only clunker is ""Destroying Angel,"" with too many puppets and (even for Midsomer) unlikely events, and a lack of humor between our favorite coppers. We relate to Barnaby's disdain for the insufferable clothing-clerk, preferring the excellent Marks 'n Sparks too (decade-old slacks from there still look good).

Beware especially the residents of Badger's Drift, rife with hidden agendas, and well upholstered, over-chintzed women bearing tea. Settle down for a virtual escape to a bucolic English countryside strewn with mayhem. This long haul is best accompanied by plenty of goodies, as Midsomer delights in torturing its susceptible audience by lingering on tea-trays laden with countless delicacies, and scrumptious looking roasts with taters 'n gravy, sausages, pudding, well, you get the picture.

A note on the fine packaging: I'd been worried about ordering this repackaging of the first four boxed sets, due to vociferous complaints by several reviewers here. They led me to believe that the packaging consisted of cardboard envelopes for the disks or worse, like ""Avatar."" Don't worry. The packaging is good, consisting of multiple plastic holders for the disks within a box. This common storage for longer series works just fine; no problem whatsoever.

I mainly bought this so my mom could see them.
  The newer ones are just as good, although there are a few clinkers like with any show, they held up throughout their long run.

3298830,4,B0011B9W38,"I'm giving this item three stars -- the average of five stars for content, one star for packaging. Expect to break at least one disk removing it from the holder.

I've watched Midsomer Murders for years, since they ran on A&E and the Biography Channel. This collection includes the best episodes, in my opinion, from the early seasons. Most are based on the Caroline Graham novels, not original scripts. If you like English village murder mysteries, these are great.

However, the packaging is atrocious: The disk holders hang on to the center hole like grim death, and every time I remove a disk I expect it to break. Finally, one did, even though I was babying it while taking it out -- the mounting catch was so tight the disk simply snapped along a radius before it released. Fortunately there's just one episode per disc.

Just a warning. Don't try to pop the disc out like you should be able to. You'll end up in splitsville.

UPDATE (02/25/2011)-- ONE MORE STAR: I complained to Acorn Media, manufacturers of the Midsomer DVDs, about the broken disc and they replaced it right away! The new disc arrived in today's mail.

3298833,5,B0011B9W38,"Midsomer Murders continues with new shows after it's debut in 1997. Over 60 episodes and growing. Why? Because it is TOP British crime drama, with a twist of humor and romance. And then there is the awesome footage of British village life, as spectacular as any English documentary/travel DVD. The characters are believable, and the crime solving is reasonable, although complex enough for the most avid of mystery fans. It helped to begin with a world-class author's books (Caroline Graham) and 6 early screenplays by none other than Anthony Horowitz (Foyle's War, Poirot, Robin of Sherwood). All six of Horowitz screenplays are included in this set.

His ""Judgment Day"" is my favorite of the earliest 18 feature length episodes in this set. Lots of laughs mixed in. A village children's orchestra, practicing for the fete, appears playing the show's theme song. But like tradition, this is multiple murder in Midsomer County, 5 in this episode. The multiple murder show was an immediate characteristic of this series, and continues to current episodes.
This set is the best way to get started with Midsomer Murders. Then move on to the second collection set ""Midsomer Murders: Barnaby's Casebook"" which can then be followed by the newest collection set of ""Midsomer Murders: Village Case Files.""

I have never watched an episode that was not a 5-star production. Speaking of stars, every British TV & film star now wants to be a guest star on this show. Guest stars began in the beginning, and are a part of what makes this such a delightful series. Here's a PARTIAL list only from this Early Cases Collection:
Episode 1 Emily Mortimer (Coming Home, Lovely & Amazing); Elizabeth Spriggs (Sense & Sensibility)
2 Anna Massey (Tess of D'Urbervilles; Machinist), Annabelle Apsion (Shameless)
3 Angela Pleasence (September, Barchester Chronicles, Mansfield Park)
6 Richard Briers (Monarch of the Glen); Julian Wadham (Dance to the Music of Time, English Patient)
9 Phyllida Law (mother of Emma Thompson); Honeysuckle Weeks (Foyle's War)
10 James Bolam (Beiderbeck X 2)
12 Orlando Bloom (Troy, Pirates of Caribbean,Lord of the Rings)
13 Prunella Scales (Mapp & Lucia, Fawlty Towers)
17 Ian McNeice (Doc Martin)
18 Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones, Kingdom), Gilliam Kearney (Forsyte Saga)

The shows are not rated but in this collection there is a bare female chest, several male backsides exposed, and graphic murder victim scenes, although usually quick. Some content is definitely, in my own opinion, for teenage and above. But you can also prepare yourself for some very tender moments. Or a belly laugh. It has it all. The only mark against it is the fact that subtitles had not been added at this point in the history of Midsomer Murder DVDs, they come later in other sets.

The length of the show, a yet continuing series, is recommendation enough for the TV series mystery viewer. Personally, I'm getting quite close now to owning every episode available on DVD. Good, good stuff. A hit on British and American TV, A&E and Biography Channel. Will it ever end? Hopefully not.",1285459200,2,3072,5.041338582677166

3298847,5,B0011B9W38,"Midsomer Murders - the Early Cases comprises the first eighteen cases of this popular series, set in the quaint little villages, moldering manor houses and cottage real-estate-to-die-for of a mythical English county. The series starts off being based on the best-selling mysteries of Caroline Graham; intricate and atmospheric, set in the modern British countryside. Classical English cozies with a wickedly modern twist; the sleuth is not Miss Marple, with a penchant for knitting and uncovering evil over the teacups and under the thatched roofs, but by a solid professional; the admirably decent Inspector Barnaby and his sidekick, Sgt Troy.

This series is the perfect cuppa for anyone who loves a certain flavor of Brit-TV. My daughter and I savored our watching of this series like we would savor consumption of a box of designer chocolates: one and a time and relishing every delicious nibble, from the misty green landscapes to the real-estate ad visions of perfection in the various locations. Never did the English countryside look so gorgeous... and never did the intrusion of bloody murder seem so perverse. You see it all if you watch carefully  in a small village, as Miss Marple so cogently observed - every sort of wickedness and perversion, every sort of kink, personal, sexual, financial, from voyeurism to incest, country dancing and an unseemly interest in Punch and Judy.

One of the charming counter-points to all of this professionally observed mayhem  is Inspector Barnaby's wryly realistic outlook, as well as his perfectly normal and happy family life; his wife is loving and a perfectly awful cook, his daughter Cully is an actress - providing a knowledgeable entry into all sorts of small-village shenanigans, as well as insight into a some different and amazingly peculiar cases. And how very pleasant it is to have a detective hero who is not a bundle of angst and dysfunction, who has a loving and satisfactory family life. These days that counts as a shockingly novel and original twist.

The best of the extras to this set is a documentary ""Super Sleuths"" that takes a long look at the first decade of the long-running series, including interviews with stars (regular and guest variety), producers, TV writers as well as Caroline Graham, who originated the series with seven very good novels. Practically every top-flight and well-known British actor has made a guest appearance in this series;  watch for Orlando Bloom, who comes to a sticky end in one episode.",1241308800,6,2495,5.0880195599022

The characters stay true to form and personal interaction is believable. I'm sure I will buy all the sets to complete my collection.

3298850,4,B0011B9W38,"As an American having spent my primary education years in a British boarding school (Brockhurst, outside Newbury), I enjoyed watching the occasional episodes of Midsomer Murders on  the biography channel when channel surfing, but didn't really get into them until, frustrated with the commericals on cable TV I decided to switch to DVD's from my local library and came across this set. Having already read all the Agatha Christies, I decided to try Midsomer Murders and was absolutely delighted with all the episodes. In order to really enjoy them, of course, it is first necessary to suspend belief in the premise that there could be so many murders in one sedate British county (although if you consider each episode separately, it is perhaps not so unbelievable that a particular murder might have occurred in that one venue.) In any case, I consider the plots to be secondary to the ambience, the settings, the characters, and window on the quintessence of British life in the countryside and small villages. (I must confess to also sometimes losing track of some of the characters, and sometimes wish the scene changes were not quite so abrupt). But once you have watched several edpisodes, you can not help but become  attached to the main characters--Barnaby, his wife, daugter, Troy, etc. I now consider myself a hopeless Midsommer addict, and plan to watch all the episodes with the hope its producers will not only hit the magic 100, but exceed it. I read where Nettles has said he'll keep playing Barnaby until the audience plays out, which I can not imagine happening anytime soon. The series has made me most nostalgic for my early years in England, and I wish it the very best.",1234137600,6,1691,4.868055555555555
3298851,5,B0011B9W38,"After enjoying the Midsomer Murder mysteries on the Bio Channel last year, I was disappointed to discover that they would no longer be televised by that network.  Then I was thrilled to discover that Amazon carried these dvd's.  Rather than buying the most current sets, I waited until The Early Cases Collection came within my price range.  I wasn't disappointed!  We have been watching an episode per night; each one is an hour and 40 minutes long.  For me, it's the perfect way to relax on a cold winter night.  Love the way Inspector Barnaby ties it all together for you at the end.  The suspects as well as non-suspects in the Midsomer villages are all just a little wierd, adding to the overall charm and suspense of these stories.  Mr. Nettles (Inspector Barnaby) is kind of the English Columbo and Gavin Troy is the perfect foil to the seasoned Inspector.  I intend to eventually, finances permitting, purchase all of these.  Anyone who loves British mysteries with a strong police procedural cast will enjoy these stories.  I can whole-heartedly recommend them.",1231372800,4,1070,4.856353591160221

This English series has ""real"" people acting.  (Not everyone is a supermodel, or a size 0, or works out and has bulging muscles.)  These actors are much more believeable because they could be your neighbor, your co-worker, family, etc.  These episodes are about 2 hours in length and make for a nice diversion in the winter evening if you enjoy a good ""whodunit"".

Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby and his right hand DS Gavin Troy are the perfect crime fighting team  and make watching a delight. The often multiple killings, lies, secrets, blackmail, an even normal village life make this series so enjoyable.

When we saw this box set of the first 18 early cases it was the perfect choice!  While not having to be watching in any particular order it is helpful to sometimes follow along the natural progression of the series, the cases and Barnaby's family life. If you love mysteries...especially British mysteries, you really MUST give these wonderful shows a chance. The acting is superb, the settings perfection, and the characters simply amusing.

3298864,5,B0011B9W38,"I love this droll, darkly humorous series set in the fictional UK county of Midsomer.  Finally, the initial 18 episodes are available in the order they were first broadcast in the UK.  What a treat!

There's something cozy about the madness behind the rustic hedges and lush landscape of this wonderful old-school murder mystery series.  Midsomer is a contained world populated with slightly inbred middle-class eccentrics.  The colorful villagers -- vicars, birdwatchers and cricket players mingle with -- and in some cases are -- murderers of great, if flawed, creativity.

Especially delicious are the first five titles taken directly from the novels of Caroline Graham. I have enjoyed ""Killings At Badger's Drift,"" ""Written In Blood,"" and ""Death Of A  Hollow Man"" multiple times.

Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettle) brings a reasoned mature calm to the lurking menace of the deceptively heavenly, stately environs.  A decent and normal man who represents the best of his breed.  And make no mistake, this series is very much about breeding.  Barnaby's sidekick DS Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) is the perfect youthful -- sometimes naive, sometimes intuitive, sometimes brash -- balance to the proceedings.

This kind of closed story-telling, in which killings are center stage and around which all the action takes place, is reassuring in a world that often reflects far harsher realities.  It's reassuring because there is closure and all is put in order and justice on some level is meted out.  At least for the time-being.

The production is top notch all round.  Colorful minor characters abound -- often stars in the making (see Orlando Bloom and others in early episodes).

What sets this apart for me, is the balance of Barnaby's private life with the horrors of his professional life.  It seems he's learned a lesson from his work and that is to appreciate even the minor irritations of domestic bliss and fatherhood, like his wife's penchant for experimental culinary experimentations and his daughter's thespian aspirations.  Very Hitchcockian English humor.

There are 18 episodes.  The smooth transition from Graham's novels to episodes based on her characters is seamless and sometimes just as diabolically clever.

A lot of care has gone into the creation and maintenance of this terrific series.  There are a total of 30 hours of delectably dastardly doings in this package as well as ""Super Sleuths,"" a fascinating bonus documentary  that takes a look at the first decade of ""Midsomer Murders.""

If classic murder mysteries are your cup of tea, don't miss this timeless set.

Beautiful packaging (the shadow of an axe murderer is on the outer box, and on the inner sleeve he's gone!) and the plastic ""page fold"" multiple disc case is the best I've seen.

Highest recommendation.",1207872000,72,2811,5.147902869757174
