1958836,2,B0000YAEGQ,I bought this DVD thinking it would be as entertaining as Baby's Day. NO way! It is very boring and does not keep my five month's attention for very long at all. The music is not fun and upbeat like Baby's Day. I would NOT reccomend going out and buying this DVD.,1140566400,,263,4.076923076923077
1958837,5,B0000YAEGQ,"My son loves this DVD.  It captures his attention as well as my own.  I ended up buying the entire collection and it was well worth it.  Every one of these DVD's has warmth, beauty, and humorous scenes. They are so engaging that I don't mind watching them over and over again.......which we do!",1128729600,2,294,4.407407407407407
1958838,5,B0000YAEGQ,This series of baby movies is a God Send!!!! My baby's been watching one a day since he was 2 months old. While I'm cooking dinner I put one of these movies on and put my son in his jumperoo. When the music tempo picks up he gets more excited and starts jumping like a nut. When the puppets come on he sits transfixed until their done. This series blows Baby Einstein out of the water. I'm soooo glad I found it!,1127088000,,412,4.036585365853658
1958839,5,B0000YAEGQ,Forget Baby Einstein. My son smiles a lot more often while watching these videos. I would get nothing done at home if I didn't have it to entertain baby!,1123718400,,153,4.310344827586207
1958840,5,B0000YAEGQ,"I have tried to very much limit the video and TV watching of my 10 month old, but we were given this DVD as a gift, and I admit we've watched it more than a few times!  I really do like it.  It's very simple---it has a musical part, usually with a child involved, and then a part with 3 puppets, who talk in baby-like language, exploring an instrument like a trumpet or a drum.  The songs are very pretty and not the typical kid fare---one of them is ""Hark, the Birds Have Come Again"" or something like that, which I had never heard before hearing it here, but it's a nice song, and we see birds during its singing, along with seeing the singers.  I checked out the extras on this---one part is a playgroup with simple ideas for activities, which I did along with my daughter.  It doesn't take the place of a real playground, of course, but there were some good ideas!  If you are planning on getting a baby DVD, I think this would be a good place to start.",1119139200,2,957,4.173913043478261
1958841,5,B0000YAEGQ,"I bought this video thinking that between my toddler and my infant, someone was sure to watch it.  I'm trying not to have my 5 month old watch TV so early, but I do play this for my daughter who is 2 1/2 now-- she still loves it!  One of the best videos for toddlers out there.  Very well made.  A baby will like seeing the images, but it's great for a toddler because a soothing voiceover names the seasons and objects and has taught my daughter many words and helped teach about seaons.  I can't say enough about this show-- and the puppets even make me chuckle.

I would say this tape would interest babies between 6-9 months to 3 years.",1098057600,11,640,4.204918032786885
1958842,5,B0000YAEGQ,"My 8 month old loves his DVD, as he does the other three Fisher Price we have. We just got this one yesterday and watched it last night, and as usual Owen could not get his eyes off the screen. He loves the puppets, they are his favorite. I love this vide because they not only have Mommies, but also Daddies playing with their kids. They show the four seasons of the year, with beautiful music and differents activities for each one.
I highly recommend this DVD, especially if you are already getting tired of the Baby Einstein series. It's a little different, but in my opinion, much better.",1083715200,3,593,4.4495412844036695

8004439,3,B0000YAEGQ,not very long but baby enjoys it for awhile but gets bored fairly quick with it. its not really educational or anything,1358553600,,119,4.454545454545454
8004440,5,B0000YAEGQ,"This is a great video, although probably a little elementary for my 2 yr. old.  She enjoyed it for a while, but I'll have it when others come along.  Very soothing and fun.",1296172800,,172,4.181818181818182
8004441,5,B0000YAEGQ,"My son is 16 months old and absolutely loves all these Fisher Price videos.  They are about 40 minutes long and the video is divided up into 6 or 7 segments (different seasons and images within those seasons).  These videos are a nice mix of music, images of babies playing, basic words (in this video - snow, flowers, leaves, beach), animals, and the puppets.  The age on these video say 0 to 12 months... but my son REALLY got into these video at 12 or 13 months.  They are his favorite.",1197849600,,489,4.34065934065934
8004442,5,B0000YAEGQ,"All of the Fisher Price videos are fun for babies - even up to two years old.  A nice switch from the Baby Einstein, Barnie, Wiggles... fun music that doesn't get stuck in your head. Great video clips and cute puppets.",1173312000,,218,4.317073170731708
