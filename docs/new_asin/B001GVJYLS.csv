8307247,4,B001GVJYLS,"I thought this was an excellent documentary for the price.  As mentioned by an earlier reviewer, it paid special attention to the problems that caused the British battlecruisers to perform so poorly in this major naval battle.  The battlecruisers were fast and had very heavy armament but were also lightly armored.  This proved a serious problem for them in the Battle of Jutland but it was not their only problem.  The documentary points out that poor communications with other ships, bad gunnery, and a lack of attention to safety issues added to the problems faced by the British.  It might have been useful to have a brief epilogue about the later loss of the battlecruiser HMS Hood in World War II since at least some of the same issues contributed to this loss.",1405641600,,768,4.7443609022556394
8307248,4,B001GVJYLS,"For those familiar with the Battle of Jutland in 1916 this DVD will hold few surprises. However, it is not easy to find many DVDs that a give good coverage to the battle (which was the standout surface naval action of WWI), this being one of a small handful.

The main focus appears to be on why three British battlecruisers exploded with such terrible ferocity.  The explanation given is consistent with that given in most history texts, but the illustration of ammunition handling procedures (filmed aboard the old battleship USS Texas) turns what could have been a dry topic into something quite fascinating. Helpful  practical demonstrations are also provided of the effects of cordite explosions in confined spaces and the speed of cordite flash.

Although coverage is given of the basic chronology of the battle and the key moves made by the key admirals involved, don't expect a detailed account of battle formations during the battle (other than the basic positions of the squadrons) or the positions and roles of the smaller warships (cruisers and destroyers).

Overall an interesting watch that may fill in some small gaps for some history buffs.",1388534400,2,1156,5.031413612565445
