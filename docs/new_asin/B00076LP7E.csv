8044990,5,B00076LP7E,"This was The Muppet Show at its best. Very entertaining and oh so funny. The guest stars , Tony Randell, Beverly Sills and Pearl Bailey worked so well with the muppets.
Highlights for me were the closing number  of the jousting scene from Camelot with Pearl Bailey and the ""Muppetipolitan Opera""  production of
'Pigoletto' with Beverly Sills performing along side assorted  hilarious Muppet characters.",1424044800,,402,5.25
8044991,5,B00076LP7E,Beveraly Sills is wonderful.  And with Pearl Bailey at her best.  It's great to see these early Muppet days.,1128816000,2,108,4.631578947368421
