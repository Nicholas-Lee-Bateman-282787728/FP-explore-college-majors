8185197,5,B000OIOOWI,"Shaoran's party has arrived in a snow covered land. The village where they are staying has had a child kidnapper on the loose. The villagers suspect that the ghost of a princess has been taking them. After looking into the matter they have several suspects. A specter isn't one of them, but magic of some sort is definitely involved. A feather may be the source of power for the kidnapper, and his bizarre MO. The atmosphere created in this part of the story is amazing. There are some great characters, and the mystery is very confusing and intense.",1355097600,,550,4.622448979591836
8185198,5,B000OIOOWI,"This has the conclusion of the second world they visit, starting where episode 10 left off. Chu Nyan now has her own hijutsu artifact, the hijutsu mirror. She uses it to stop Tombal. When Syaoran returns the feather back to Sakura, it's a memory of her birthday, except she keeps talking to an empty chair. That, of course, was where Syaoran was sitting, so he was completely erased.

This is a really good volume. I really loved the episode ""A Warm Smile"", though some might consider a filler episode, I thought it was a wonderful episode, as we see some of their childhood memories together. It's so cute <33

And then they jump to the next world! This is a world that is cold, it's snowing, and they find themselves at a town that has a legend about a magical feather being given to the golden haired princess 300 years ago, and that the children who came to the castle, when they returned, never were the same. Now children are disappearing again! Is the legend true? And is the magical feather Sakura's? Will they solve this mystery? Watch to find out!",1253059200,,1057,4.528795811518324
8185199,5,B000OIOOWI,"as Volume 3 of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.  It finds our heroes on a new planet and new adventures in front of them.  This one contains four more episodes:

11.  The Chosen Tomorrow (last part of volume 2, episode 10)
12.  A Warm Smile
13.  Advocate of Illusions
14.  Truth In History

A worthy addition or purchase for anyone interested in this series.  but it is best if you start off on volume 1 and work your way up.  It is a great series that keeps getting better with each new volume.",1209254400,,491,4.2967032967032965
