If ""Figli di Annibale"" (""Children of Hannibal"" from 1998), does not make you crack-a-smile and laugh uncontrollably, then there's no hope for you! When down on his luck 'Domenico' (Silvio Orlando) decides to head north, to rob a bank no less, things really get out-of-hand. In order to escape, he takes a willing hostage 'Tommaso' (Diego Abatantuono ""Mediterraneo"" 1991), and together they hit the road and make a run for it. I don't want to give anymore away, so as to spoil it for anyone. Suffice it to say: if you're like me, and appreciate the gesticulating-comedy and the 'play on words' that the Italians are masters of; then believe me, you will be in stitches with this one! The cast: Silvio Orlando, Diego Abatantuono, Valentina Cervi, Flavio Insinna, etc. This recalled the comedy classics of Toto, Alberto Sordi, Marcelo Mastroianni, Carlo Verdone, etc. The DVD picture and sound quality from TLA Releasing is very good. NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), NR 90 mins.

Love and Peace,
