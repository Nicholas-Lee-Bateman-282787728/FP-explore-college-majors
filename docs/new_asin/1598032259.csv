8617939,5,1598032259,"This course was very interesting and we hated to see it end.  The professor is knowledgeable, highly intelligent and delivers the lectures in a way that draws the viewer in.  He covers the history of the continent from pre-historic times to current times, geography, climate, sociology, language, culture and much more.  The focus is on Egypt and then sub-Sarahan Africa.  We finished the course wishing that the professor would do a few in-depth courses on individual countries sometime in the future.",1433894400,2,502,5.160493827160494
