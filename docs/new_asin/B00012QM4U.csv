1968591,5,B00012QM4U,"I was given this DVD as a gift.  With that said, even if it was not gifted to me, I would have no problem spending $10 on it.  As someone who has long been enthralled with Japanese culture, I enjoyed this unique view of Japan.  While it hits the major themes repeated in many other shows and specials on the country, it also offers looks into some of the lesser known, overlooked aspects of the country.  A pleasant and inexpensive alternative to a real tour of Japan.",1179878400,14,468,4.344827586206897

Our customers who used to live in Japan or have visited Japan are glued to the video and start refreshing many special memories from Japan.

1968595,3,B00012QM4U,"Not a bad documentary, but I've seen better. My children found the narrator's voice to be a bit annoying. Some segments seemed a bit long and drawn out and could have been cut down a bit.

However, there were some great shots and interesting facts presented.",1173657600,2,258,4.608695652173913
1968596,5,B00012QM4U,"When I first saw this video, I thought it was pretty good. Because the presentation is made by a software company, I felt that the cinematography was outstanding, but that the naration sounded like it was from someone that would work at a software company (ie: somewhat nerdy). I had debated whether to show this to some of my mentally ill clients that I work with. I finally opted to show it. To my surprise, they loved it. Comment ranged from ""They really packed a lot in an hour"", to mentioning about specifics (the snow monkeys, the high tech section, the robots, the gardens, etc.). As a matter of fact, I thought that I would have a difficult time ending the group on time because they were fascinated with the high tech, and cars section. But almost on cue, it ended with a shot of Mt. Fuji. The company may get some more business that they wouldn't have gotten, as several co-workers, and clients asked me where I got it. So (as you can see) this review isn't mine alone, but several people. And considering that a ten spot won't even fill up a car anymore, it makes this video a great getaway. And because it's from a software company, (more than likely) this video will NOT be shown on Discovery, Travel, NG, or any of the other major cable networks. My advice, for the cinematography alone, it's more than worth the ten spot. Get it.",1166054400,41,1344,4.467479674796748

1968598,1,B00012QM4U,"The voice is not great. I've seen these pictures elsewhere, and you don't understand a lot of what this speaker is saying, and that's bad, it's like mumbling, and high pitched, and slick sounding. Basically, the voice ruins it. Buy, another source on japanese information as there is plenty out there, and please rent this first before considering buying. One of the worst videos I've heard. Great topic of course, but not a good job on making this.",1367020800,,449,4.769230769230769

1968602,3,B00012QM4U,"I got this for my son while he was studying Japan in 4th grade.  It sort of works at that general-interest level.  The visuals are especially nice and the music, though a bit stereotypical, is good too.  But the narration is nearly insufferable -- whiny voiceover (who picked this guy?), repetitive wording (one could make a saki-drinking game listening for variations on ""majestic""), somewhat sexist/exoticizing (""beautiful geishas""), and lots of touristy orientalizing boosterism.  Still, it's a good price -- and one can always switch to the Japanese language option and just watch the nice pictures.",1351641600,2,603,5.315789473684211
1968603,3,B00012QM4U,This shows many sights mainly toward the south and includes one spa resort in particular on Hokkaido (probably a sponsor). Some of the photography is nice but the narrative is rather stiff. Still travel videos on Japan were hardly abundant so it was worth watching for the information content.,1330560000,2,293,5.0
1968604,3,B00012QM4U,This video is great for covering a quick snapshot of the entire country of Japan.  I feel it spends too much time in the outer areas instead of focusing on Tokyo and Kyoto.  I was looking for a video that would show you how to get around in the bigger cities.  All in all is was a good video but not what I was looking for.,1320105600,3,323,3.8636363636363638
1968605,3,B00012QM4U,"I admit that I bought this DVD because I wanted free shipping on other items. I read reviews, pro and con, before choosing it and hoped that it would be better than it turned out to be.

If you are looking for a laundry list of places it's important to see in Japan and you don't mind a noticeably American accent providing the narration, this is a good checklist for a whirlwind tour. It was also very helpful to me to see how crowded these places are, with Japanese tourists as well as foreign ones, since crowds are not my thing. And since cars are not high on my list either, the SEARCH FORWARD button on my dvd player was useful -- but luckily most of the technology comes at the end anyway.

I wanted to see traditional Japan in order to offset the recent news coverage of the earthquakes/tsunami/nuclear disaster triple hitter. This light hearted tour of all the best sights made me feel worse about what has happened there in the last month (March to April, 2011). The narrator's assurances that the high speed trains are never late and that the country is uniquely safe to travel in underscored the incredible stories of thousands of passengers stranded in Tokyo railway stations and the ever expanding area where nuclear radiation levels are unsafe.

I would have enjoyed lingering longer over views of cherry blossoms and geisha, although the dancing robot was appealing in its own way. But most, I deeply regret the narrator's insistence on placing the accent wrong in all the place names. I knew he wasn't doing well, but when he pronounced ""NAgano"" as ""NaGAno"", I wondered where he was when the Olympics were held there! If I watch it again, I'll probably mute the narration.",1303084800,,1689,4.642140468227424
1968606,4,B00012QM4U,"This is like a teaser travel guide to Japan. It gives recommendations on where to go. This is ideal for someone who has the itch to travel to Japan and is planning a trip. I was happy to remember places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Miyajima, etc. Japan is a great place for sight seeing with beautiful architecture and nature. They do a good job of covering the country. I would have liked more attention to nature and less focus on technology. I wish it had more of a ""relaxation dvd"" feel to it. it is more of a medium paced narrated travel guide. Production could be better, but I'm still happy with it.",1301788800,4,614,4.394736842105263

It covers all of the sites I want to explore including Tokyo's museums and nightlife,  Kyoto's temples and Kamakura's samurai plus much much more.  I found the camera work to be outstanding; the DVD's many scenes covered more of the country than I had expected from a one hour video..

1968610,3,B00012QM4U,This video is visually attractive and features many sights that would interest a visitor or someone nostalgic for Japan. However the production seems a bit amateurish. I would not recommend this for students if you're a teacher looking for resources.,1249430400,3,250,5.275

1968612,5,B00012QM4U,"Japan: Samurai, Geisha & Technology"" is an impressive DVD video that has unique benefits for both first time and repeat visitors to Japan.

8005792,2,B00012QM4U,"This was a decent DVD, but it could've been so much better if they tried harder. The video quality was poor- it looked like one of those 1970's educational videos. It begins in Tokyo (my second favorite city in the world after London) at the Imperial Palace. It also features the Ginza Shopping District, Shibuya, Tsukiji Fish Market, and various ostentatious Buddhist temples. The narrator recommended visiting the Tokyo National Museum since it is full of art, samurai artifacts, and kimonos from the past. The DVD briefly featured the Tokyo Metro. It also included the famous Shinkansen (Bullet Train).

The DVD included other cities in Japan, like Kyoto, which was beautiful, and Hiroshima, which has a World War II memorial. The DVD ended with a visit to Mount Fuji.

This could've been a great DVD, but they didn't really go into detail on various topics. For example, when they rode the Tokyo Metro, they said to avoid rush hour due to the overcrowding. However, they didn't explain how to purchase tickets or how to travel from the airport to the downtown area (this would've been helpful information due to the language barrier). I also felt that the DVD didn't quite spend enough time in downtown Tokyo. It didn't show any Pachinko Parlor's and it didn't really go into detail on the geisha. The DVD mentioned that Japanese people eat a lot of sushi, but it didn't mention the name of any specific restaurants.

I don't recommend this DVD. It's sad because there aren't that many decent DVD's pertaining to Japan. Rick Steves, who IMO, is the best tour guide, only does Europe. If this DVD was another 15-30 minutes longer and had better video quality, it would've easily been a 5. If you want to watch a halfway-decent DVD about Japan, I recommend ""Rudy Maxa's World Japan"" and ""Lonely Planet Six Degrees Tokyo"". Even Globe Trekker, who have a bunch of annoying and pretentious hosts, produced a better Tokyo episode than this.",1421798400,,1938,4.831325301204819

8005797,5,B00012QM4U,This was a very interesting DVD and the scenery was beautiful.  Just do not watch with someone who speaks a little Japanese.

8005798,2,B00012QM4U,"I guess for $10, I shouldn't complain, but I found this video annoying from end to end and sometimes even offensive.  The narrator can't even pronounce many of the Japanese words and names.  (e.g. ""shinKANzen"" or ""Tokee-oh"" or ""Kee-oto"").  Then there are the stupid comments like the one about the girl Sadako, who isn't even named in the video:  ""she thought that by folding a thousand paper cranes, she could live.. [long pause] but she died.""  Or this gratuitous and totally irrelevant comment ""Now Japan and the United States are strong allies, democracies dedicated to freedom in a world [pause] threated [pause] by terrorists.""  And you'd think that the best reason for visiting ""Himeji-jo castle"" (yes, that's what they call it) is that a James Bond movie was filmed there.

I would have thought that a tech company (since i guess that's who created this video) would at least do  a better job with the filming and editing.  Instead, there are lots of shaky hand-held shots, and it seems the only filming technique they know is to focus up close and then zoom out.  Then you find yourself bracing yourself for the abrupt cuts from one shot to something totally different with no attempt easing the transition.  Some high school students could probably have done a better job for an introductory film class.

Originally I just gave it one star, but I upped it to two, since maybe for $10, it's worth seeing a lot of pictures of famous places in Japan.  I might just suggest turning off the sound to avoid the worst of it.",1374019200,6,1527,4.695488721804511
