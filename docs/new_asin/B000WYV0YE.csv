8226074,5,B000WYV0YE,"Exceptional.  As learning techniques is difficult for me in a classroom as I forget what I see just about as soon as the instructor walks away, this is soooo good for me because I can review review review.  And, the stretches are excellent - easy on my hands (which is why I decided to incorporate more stretches into my practice) and my clients love them.  It goes somewhat fast, but is easy enough to hit the 'rewind' button.  Plus, most of the time, she shows the 'right' side and then repeats everything on the 'left' side so the techniques are shown twice.  Another added plus is the second DVD of self-stretches.  While I only did these once, I know they are good for me and as a VERY YOUNG senior (63), they are important for me to do.  I cannot recommend this one highly enough.

8226076,5,B000WYV0YE,This is a great instructional DVD.  I had an opportunity to take Kay's class and loved the stretches.  The DVD is very informative and easy to follow.  Kay is an expert at Thai stretching and shows you how to do some of the best ones to help your clients.  I am a Massage Therapist and have used some of these stretches during my sessions.  My clients love it!,1217462400,3,360,4.235294117647059
8226077,4,B000WYV0YE,"As a professional massage therapist, I am always looking for high quality videos to refine and add to my current skill set.  This DVD, while not perfect, is one of the better videos I have seen for professional therapists of all levels.

PROS: A variety of interesting techniques and gentle stretches that can be used by professional therapists (as well as non-professionals.)  Quality production (sound/video.)

CONS: This DVD is advertised as something you can do with your client ""awake or sound asleep, draped or fully clothed,"" though I can't see how you would do this routine with the client undressed and draped.  A demonstration would be nice.  Also, I was mildly offended by the repeated use of the word ""butt"" instead of gluteals or hips.  This is, after all, meant to be a professional treatment video.",1217289600,5,813,4.9338235294117645
8226078,5,B000WYV0YE,"As a Licensed Massage Practioner always looking to learn new techniques and skills, I found this DVD useful and beneficial in learning effective stretches for my clients. I liked how the stretches were shown on both sides of the body and from varying angles so that the viewer clearly sees how to perform them. I have already used several of these stretches in my practice with positive feedback from my clients. The self-care DVD is also a great addition to any LMP's practice.",1217289600,5,478,4.771084337349397
