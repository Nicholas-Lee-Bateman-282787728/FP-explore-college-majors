6619226,1,B00NALHK8Q,"So sick of this.  I JUST went out and bought the first five seasons...also made by SHOUT! Factory, waiting, hopefully for the sixth and last season to come out....nope, found out that it will never be released for all of us loyal customers to complete this series.  Now we have to buy the entire set at $125+ to complete it?  No way.....",1410912000,28,337,4.403225806451613

The disk surfaces appeared to be spotted and had several small scratches on them. Some of the disks in the other seasons were the same way. Sent the set back for a refund. Word of advice.. any disks made by Shout! Factory should be checked for this. I have seen it on some other sets of DVD's as well, but at least they played.",1519084800,,477,4.031578947368421

6619265,5,B00NALHK8Q,"I just ordered this and it hasn't arrived yet but most of the reviews have been positive. I've grown to love this show more and more with each passing year. Although I was much too young to have watched it when it first aired, I caught episodes here and there and grew to love it. Also watching it on Antenna TV greatly influenced me in getting this. Although those are the syndicated episodes they're still great. My favourite episode, so far, is ""Wilbur in the lion's den"" from season three. Just hearing Ed whine and kick his stall door because he wants a kite is just the cutest and funniest bit.",1470528000,3,600,4.414414414414415

6619288,5,B00NALHK8Q,What canI say this is Mr Ed. That speaks for itself. But really.it is fantastic to watch such a great show,1443225600,,106,4.095238095238095
6619289,5,B00NALHK8Q,"""Hello, I'm Mister Ed."" This was the start of of each of the 143 episodes of a show that took television by storm in the 1960s. From the very first show architect Wilbur Post (Allan Young)  had his world turned upside down as the adventures and mayhem begins for him. Carol (Connie Hines), his wife, came along for the ride but never got to know Mr. Ed like Wilbur did.
  Wilbur's life is never dull for one moment when Mr. Ed allows him into his secret life, but is it all strawberries and cream? I don't know as it depends on your view on life, but the comedy never ends for the whole of the six series.
  Grab a copy and see if you can put up with the antics of a horse that is not a horse. Would you go mad if a horse started talking to you?  Would you take it on the chin and slowly go crazy because you talk to a horse, even if it isn't a horse?
  Anyway, take your chance and enjoy an excellent sitcom from an era when comedy was at its apex and television was a marvel to watch. Even after 50 years I can honestly say that Mr. Ed is as hilarious now as it was back then.
  I gave this complete series five stars because the comedy never stops and reminded me of a time long gone for television.",1443052800,2,1202,3.99163179916318

6619314,2,B00NALHK8Q,We love the series Mr Ed but whoever put this dvd set together did not make it viewer friendly.  My husband gets very annoyed because he cannot select the episode he wants to see.  He has to always watch from the beginning in some of the seasons.  Which makes it unable for him to get beyond the first or second episode unless he wants to sit and watch for 24 hours straight through.  Very annoying.  So annoying that I fear making anymore complete series purchases and having this happen again.,1430956800,7,495,4.455555555555556

The horse would shake all the time and eventually went into a seizure and died.  In todays world they would have got arrested for Animal cruelty . This is one of the best and must have tv series collection to own. Comedy Comedy Comedy. A talking horse and Wilber Post and his pointy boobed wife, and good old Addison LOL get this one kiddies!!!!! The horse paid the price, but a great comedy lives on.",1430092800,,567,4.25

6619319,5,B00NALHK8Q,"I Love Mister Ed and never get tired of watching the episodes. The hilarious situations Ed drags Wilbur into have stood the test of time.

I had this item on my wish list for a long time, but a local station had been airing two episodes early weekday mornings (after a long period of running multiple episodes on Saturday & Sunday mornings - which they had stopped) and I could usually watch one while I was getting ready for work so it wasn't a ""must-have"".  Then they moved the show to a later time slot and I was left with being able to only catch an occasional Saturday afternoon episode.  I was unhappy.  I missed Mister ED.  Singing ""pretty little filly with the pony tail"" to myself while I fixed my hair in the morning wasn't cutting it.

I was thrilled when I got the Amazon e-mail advertising the 30% off sale and couldn't place an order fast enough.  Now I'll be able to see uncut episodes!  I'll be able to watch Mister Ed all day when I am sick in bed!  I can have a marathon whenever I want!  I can decide if I am in the mood for Kay and Roger and his apples or Gordon and Winnie!  Mister Ed surfing, driving a truck, jumping out of a plane, breaking a spy ring, ordering various and sundry items over the telephone using Wilbur's good credit, you name it.  Ed's one-liners always kill me.  My favorite one ever was ""I love Christmas. Wilbur is so full of the spirit of giving, and I'm so full of the spirit of receiving.""

No one cracks me up more than my beloved Mister Ed.",1429833600,10,1489,4.23404255319149

6619331,5,B00NALHK8Q,"What an Excellent series!  Tons of heart and still funny today!  The cast is wonderful and Rocky Lane did such a wonderful voice for Ed, that he seems so real and even his mouth movements, etc. are still really something to look at!  The series was well written and love seeing the great Alan Young and Connie Hines together in the bonus!  I am glad she did that before she passed.  SHOUT deserves a big hand for re-doing season one with the uncut episodes and season 6 is among my very favorites!  My favorite episode features Irene Ryan as Granny with The Beatles at the Hollywood Wax Museum (6th season episode).  I watch at least three episodes before bed every night and I can watch these over and over again!",1423612800,5,714,4.446153846153846
6619332,5,B00NALHK8Q,This show is hilarious.  I bought the complete series after only seeing a few episodes on the internet.  I made the right choice.  Sometimes I laugh so hard I can't breathe!  The writing is so clever.  I was especially happy that the episodes are in black & white.  I couldn't watch a colorized Mr. Ed.  The series was a gift to myself for Christmas and I'm so glad I did it!,1423094400,22,375,4.197183098591549
6619333,4,B00NALHK8Q,"Shout! offers some good Extras with The Complete Mr. Ed, unlike the bare-bones Complete I Spy, where there weren't any extras.  The commentaries by Robert Culp from the Image release of the show in the beginning of the century were lost.
All the episodes from the first season have over a running time of 25Min.
The Complete Mr. Ed  has some fascinating interviews with both Alan Young and Connie Hines that fans of the show will welcome.
I learned a lot of things I did not know, including Connie Hines integral part in the rigged game shows on television in the 1950s.
And as Alan Young has come to be known as the voice for voice Uncle Scrooge, Alan Rocky Lane (who was Red Ryder, in the series of Republic films with a little Bobby Blake as Little Beaver) would probably be remembered more for the off camera voice of the talking Mr. Ed.
You see Mr. Ed in sun-glasses, and a more thoughts on the series, along with the diversity Shout! is bringing to DVD and Blu-ray in

6619341,5,B00NALHK8Q,This is one of the GREAT TV Shows of all time! Alan Young shows what a Brilliant Comic Actor he was! Belly Laughs galore and fabulous team of Straight Men make it work superbly! Connie Hines was perfect as Carol and Edna Skinner as well! Sadly Larry Keating died during the Shows run(one of the greats)! Leon Ames replaced him and is quite good as is the Wife Florence MacMichael! Watch some with Barry Kelly as Wilburs Father n Law... Some of the best ones! Put these Shows on for Friends and Family members who are ill or depressed...watch them light up! Ed was one very smart horse!! No doubt is is the Star of the Show!,1420934400,2,623,4.333333333333333

6619347,4,B00NALHK8Q,"After long last, MISTER ED: THE COMPLETE SERIES has arrived. This complete set offers some plusses that will be a boon to the completist.

For starters, the first season has finally been remastered using uncut, complete episodes which were not available when Shout! Factory initially released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mister-Ed-Season-1/dp/B002AMVEHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mister Ed: Season 1</a>&nbsp;in 2009. In addition, the long-awaited release of the sixth season has been resolved with this release (MISTER ED was unceremoniously cancelled halfway through its sixth season, resulting in only 13 episodes). It is hoped that Shout! will eventually release the sixth season as a stand-alone offering.

The cons are few. Compared to other shows sold as a complete series, $85 is a little hefty (though that price for 22 discs equates to roughly $4.30 a disc: not a bad price). Other shows, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bewitched-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00DXLO086/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bewitched: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Dream-of-Jeannie-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00DXLO0D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Dream of Jeannie: The Complete Series</a>, owned by Sony, can be sold at bargain prices of under $30 because behemoth companies like Sony can afford to fund any loss of sales. Shout! is not in this position, hence; the higher sales price. Sales figures for previous MISTER ED season releases were not as stellar as other series', resulting in this higher price as well. While other reviewers on here have griped that Shout! is ripping them off by forcing them to purchase the entire set in order to obtain Season Six, the sad reality is that most distributors repackage previously sold sets on a regular basis.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hogan-s-Heroes-The-Komplete-Series-Kommandant-s-Kollection/dp/B002L9N4O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hogan's Heroes: The Komplete Series, Kommandant's Kollection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilligan-s-Island-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B0050MB5AC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilligan's Island: The Complete Series Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-S-H-Martinis-and-Medicine-Complete-Collection/dp/B000HT3P5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;and the aforementioned Sony sets are all guilty of this practice. There is little the consumer can do about it. The other gripe is the lack of closed captioning, which was  available on the previously released Seasons 1-5. Why Shout! Factory reprocessed the complete set version without this necessity is unknown but clearly isolates those fans who are hearing impaired. However, the fact the CC versions are available at all is a good thing.

Overall, this set is highly recommended. The pros far outweigh the cons. Six complete seasons of uncut episodes in pristine condition is a good thing.",1418256000,35,3184,7.482666666666667

We baby-boomers often need the close-captioning/subtitling to be able to enjoy them.  Again, this release of an entire series has no captions.  Sadly, we cannot buy them.
