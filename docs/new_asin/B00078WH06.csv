8276517,3,B00078WH06,"This tutorial was helpful. After watching the DVD's (there are 2), I was able to start using VT(4) right away. I now have confidence in my ability to use VT(4) effectively and have at least a better idea of how much this software package can accomplish. So, I would recommend this tutorial DVD, for anyone interested in using VT(4).",1204761600,,332,4.6440677966101696
