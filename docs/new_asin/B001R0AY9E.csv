8336914,3,B001R0AY9E,A very early anthology type drama on television. Production value is obviously lacking but lots of campy fun. worth a few bucks.,1448928000,,128,4.863636363636363
8336915,4,B001R0AY9E,"Suspense is more fun watched in tandem with the radio series. If you're not willing to listen to old radio programs, you're probably not willing to watch old TV. One complaint is that the first of the 3 boxes is more expensive than the other two, without any obvious good reason. My only REAL complaint is that there are not more episodes. I assume most of the series is ""lost"" due to negligence. Hopefully, some more intact treasures will turn up. Oh, I almost forgot. I do have a complaint. These discs spin so fast, I could not play them on my normal DVD player, and had to use a different one for it to work. On the other one, it would spin loud and fast on the menu, but played pretty normal as long as it wasn't sitting on menu. The commercials in the show can be annoying because they are commercials, especially the times when they are exceptionally dumb. It looks like the same sponsor throughout, at least in the episodes I have seen. There are many guest stars and popular actors from the olden days on the show. Jackie Cooper! I like how you occasionally see mistakes made on the set. One episode has a guy leave the scene then come right back down the stairs before they were out of the shot, and he quickly turns around and goes back. A few times you might notice a boom mike dangling into the top of the scene or things of that nature. When I was a kid I remember never seeing mistakes on TV, yet knowing they made them. This series is a good historical record of early television and its evolution into what it is today. It was made by CBS.

Rather than being turned off by the black and white, low quality video, and old time period, I think all these are part of the appeal. The variety of stories, actors, and themes makes the show fun to watch. The introduction music sounds like an old time radio show, and rather than being turned off by that, I feel it makes the show all the more intriguing. Watching the show seems like what it would be like to 'watch' an old radio program. The radio show introduction sounds about the same as the television show. I would have said the radio show wasn't as good as the TV series, after hearing the first 10 episodes, except there are a few really good ones in between boring or mediocre episodes. Check out ""The Hitchhiker"" with Orson Welles and ""Fugue in C Minor"" with Vincent Price. It's a thriller.

The black and white is relaxing at night, and the story is not gory. The radio show was a very long-running series, lasting a little over 20 years. The radio show went from June 17, 1942 to September 30, 1962, while the television series ran from 1949 to 1954.",1406592000,,2623,4.340122199592668
8336916,5,B001R0AY9E,"This is one of a collection of 3 lost episodes of suspense if you like the old black and white shorts and want a trip down memory lane, then all three dvd sets is a must.  Fantastic collection of nostalga, quality as expected but definately worth collecting.",1366761600,,258,4.48936170212766
8336917,5,B001R0AY9E,"The quality of this set was great. I have the first two collection and wanted the complete set. Great show, well done. I was and am a big fan of the radio version, and when it first was shown on TV I was an instant fan because of the high quality of production, just as you would have found on the radio version. I only wish it had lasted longer on TV. Now I can enjoy it once again.",1361750400,,383,3.8607594936708862
8336918,1,B001R0AY9E,"It's missing disc #2 of this series.  We are very, very disappointed.  Is there a way to get that disc?",1356652800,,103,4.1
8336919,4,B001R0AY9E,"INFINITY's three SUSPENSE collections are dubbed from antique kinescopes, a process in which a film camera is pointed at a TV monitor and synched so that it doesn't capture a raster flicker. The sound is particularly clear, undoubtedly because audio was directly patched from a mixing board. Video quality is a bit grainy and similar to other kinescopes in that the picture's edges are missing and the view favors one side of the screen. I notice a slight tilt to the right.

When the long-running SUSPENSE radio program made a jump to television in 1949, several crew members and show scripts also came along. Of greatest prominence are director Robert Stevens and organist Hank Sylvern. Stevens also directed several dozen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfred-Hitchcock-Presents/dp/B000AL733G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>&nbsp;TV episodes. Sylvern was organist on a number of radio shows and the composer of themes for ""The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin,"" ""Strike It Rich"" and others, plus the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Corbett-Space-Cadet/dp/B0028ZI8E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Corbett, Space Cadet</a>&nbsp;TV series. He was also an orchestra leader.

I like best the earliest ('49) episodes of SUSPENSE, for they illustrate how post-war TV was a ""learn as you go"" process. These programs with live AUTO-LITE commercials run over 29 minutes each. It's impressive to see actors under the pressure of a live broadcast hit their marks, get their lines right and emote without overdoing it. Because of Sylvern's ever-present organ, SUSPENSE on TV is much like radio with pictures.

Of the dozens of TV series DVD collections in my home library, the Lost TV Episodes of SUSPENSE are among my very favorites. They're not perfect by any means, but they are perfect examples of what television was like over 60 years ago. Highest recommendation for fans of historic ""live"" TV broadcasts.

8336920,5,B001R0AY9E,"This is a terrific unique look at what was live TV in the 1950's. The stories do vary in quality, both in transfer quality and plot elements, (frankly none measure up to the level of the excellent radio series of the same name), but they are always interesting to watch. Nothing on TV today is directed or filmed quite like this.

The episodes have many fine performances with familar faces from their younger days. Each episode has a directorial style much closer to stage work than film or TV. And it was all done live, with the usual surprises that can come with that, (ex: a train compartment door coming off the hinges). From time to time you may even catch the occasional glimpse of a cameraman in the scene. And the Auto-Lite commercials are just icing on the cake.

If you have a fondness for vintage TV shows or even a passing curiosity, this would be a fine purchase to add to your collection. And while you're at it, consider ordering a collection of programs from the very fine Suspense radio series. Taut, compelling, truly suspenseful, and superbly acted, you would be well rewarded.",1297814400,4,1097,4.62051282051282
8336921,5,B001R0AY9E,"This is the third and final set of SUSPENSE tv series. Based on the radio program of the same name with original network commercials of Auto-Lite, the sponsor. This series was dramatized ""live"" from theatrical stages so it's as early television broadcasting history as one can get. They are limited with sets and costumes but most of the productions, compared to other TV series during the live broadcasting era, but they are above average.

Boris Karloff stars in ""The Yellow Scarf."" Rod Serling's ""Nightmare at Ground Zero"" comes recommended. Also note the 1963 episode without host Sebastian Cabot but stars James Whitmore and the 1958 unaired TV pilot with Keenan Wynn. These are just some of the surprises in this box set. As for transfer quality, it doesn't get any better from kinescopes.

I recommend you buy all three sets to have as complete a set as you can get.",1238716800,16,873,4.8133333333333335
