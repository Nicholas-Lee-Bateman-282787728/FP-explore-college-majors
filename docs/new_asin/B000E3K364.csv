2485805,5,B000E3K364,"This is a film that should have received a great deal more

attention.  It's shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard,

and beautifully filmed.  It's about relationships and the

interaction between people--Beau Bridges as the husband, who

can usually commute down from Boston on weekends, Helen Mirren

as the psychologiccaly troubled wife with two young children,

and Kyra Sedgwick as the au pair/mother's helper Bridges hires to

cook and look after the kids, since Mirren cannot do so.

Sedgwick also has some deep-rooted psychological problems, and

it is fascinating to watch Mirren emerge from her own problems

to help Sedgwick.  It's not an easy movie to watch--no murders

or car chases to provide a counterpoint.  The cast is stellar

and the story is compelling, and by the end of the film you

feel somewhat drained emotionally.  A fine film!",1150761600,29,861,5.071942446043166
2485806,4,B000E3K364,"This is a thinking woman's type movie. For this concerns one that has reached a certain age, a certain stature, 'happily' married with a child and then the dawning (and daunting) realization that her life is a hollow shell. Self expression without self, an artist barely passed a failed suicide riddled with doubt now neither a wife or a mother. Then there is an awakening back to herself - an epiphany of who she is and who she wants. But at what cost?
 Helen Mirren plays this role like a suit of clothing, her sheer ability to progress from a drugged automaton to the self aware woman that 'what she has is not enough'. The supporting cast of Kyra Sedgwick as the nanny/nurse and Beau Bridges as the trying to comprehend husband are also excellent. Without revealing the plot the interaction of the three actors is superb.
 The plotline is totally believable and realistic - there are no true villains here (or heroes) just everyday people trying to cope with life situations that are almost more then they can handle. I felt empathy with each of the characters, their actions and reactions were totally understandable within the framework of the film.
 So, bottom line, this is a good movie but it is definitely character driven. Personal awareness and growth are themes that resonant to all.",1095120000,19,1296,4.751111111111111
2485807,5,B000E3K364,"After I viewed this movie I was so thankful to have been taken in by this story.  Helen Mirren was one of my favorite actresses before seeing her in this movie, but this one clinched it for me.  As she found out who and what she was, I suffered and cried with her for her pain. What a moving story....",1079222400,11,301,4.0
2485808,5,B000E3K364,"I know this is the kind of film that would be shunned by the general public. It's a downer, it's heady, it's hard for many people to relate to. But for me, it is art. It has a purity, an innocence, and beauty you rarely find in films today. I applaud Kevin, Helen and Kyra for risking so much with this movie -- it is lovely -- if you're not afraid to look inside.",1021939200,8,364,3.9324324324324325
2485809,5,B000E3K364,"This movie captivates you from the very beginning. You can almost feel Mirren's condition and are pulled into it.  I was asking myself why Sedgwick would want to take on such a challenging task of taking care of a  woman in her condition when she had already had to deal with it in her own  family. However, the movie gelled for me when she faced off with Mirren in  the pouring rain in such a tormented state trying to find answers to her  past.  This not only was a healing moment for Elizabeth, but a turning  point for Chase as well.  This movie showed the depth of a woman who went  along and played by all the rules, until it proved too much.  I was a  little sad at the end when Chase's husband left and found another woman,  yet Elizabeth did not stay.  But the title does sort of give it away.  You  felt good though, knowing she had a new direction in life and a better  understanding of herself.",948844800,17,906,4.2105263157894735
2485810,4,B000E3K364,"First off, this movie should only be rated PG13. But I didn't know it was filmed in '95, probably why it got the R rating. Anyway, Helen Mirren and Kyra Sedgwick do an excellent job. Bo Bridges character wasn't asked to do much.... but he is as always a good actor. The only problem with this story is there is never a doctor present. He could have been used to fill in a lot of the gaps that seem to be in the script. Plus, the cinematography could have been more dynamic. All and all, I liked the story and recommend to others.",1520294400,3,529,4.145631067961165

2485819,4,B000E3K364,"What a surprising movie; what a good movie!  Acting superb, location fantastic. Mirren in a complicated role done with her usual flawless performance.  Kyra Sedgewick, if only known to you from ""the Closer"" on TV, will be a surprise to you and Beau Bridges gives an understated performance far different from any other of his.",1386201600,,326,4.909090909090909
2485820,5,B000E3K364,"A great story! Mirren and Sedgwick's characters are complicated and played beautifully by both. Ms. Mirren's portrayal of a woman recovering from an emotional breakdown is on point, and she draws a trail for her audience in through her character's brokeness. Ms. Sedgwick's character has a 'breakdown' of her own one the night in their garden under the pouring rain. Sedgwick 'flips out'(sic) so perfectly. I think it's a great tribute to an actress/actor when they can so effectively emote the edgy and excruciating truth of a disturbed life. Both Mirren and Sedgwick accomplish this in this film. Each women's emotional wounds bring about a healing to one another. It's very touching. And, Beau Bridges plays a loving husband perfectly. But I must confess...my first reason for purchase was because I found out about the aforementioned kiss between Ms. Mirren and Ms. Sedgwick. To top all that off, this film is directed by Kevin Bacon, who generously includes a meditative cd with sounds of the ocean breaking on the shore. Which is reflective not only of the location where the film was shot, but, I also sense Mr. Bacon understands the healing benefit these sounds offer to anyone whose life has capsized.
My only complaint is that there wasn't more kissing. ;) What can I say?",1384732800,9,1282,4.939814814814815
2485821,4,B000E3K364,"Helen Mirren, of course, is excellent in this movie.  Incredible acting on her part.  Beau Bridges whinng voice drove me nuts, wanted to slap him silly if he didn't shut up.  He played the ""I can fix-it"" husband.  But he does come to the realization that some relationships/situations are not fixable.  Kyra Sedwick and the young boys did a good job on their characters.",1382227200,,370,4.71875

2485826,3,B000E3K364,"A movie that has both Helen Mirren and Kyra Sedgwick in leading roles is quite a treat. As the story unfolds, you are drawn closer to the undercurrent that drives both characters. However, I cannot ignore two troubling implications made towards the end that prevent me from giving it my wholehearted recommendation -- the first: that a woman who has suffered a mental breakdown, been gripped by depression, and ultimately finds her true nature somehow lessens the 'manhood' of the husband who has loved her during her illness and recovery; the second: that developing a same-sex attraction for someone you've grown to admire and care about can be interpreted as an undetected mental instability. These two melodramatic whoppers should have been left on the cutting room floor. I've given ""Losing Chase"" three stars for the acting and production, and for a story that held tight until almost the end.",1319155200,2,899,5.040268456375839

2485830,1,B000E3K364,"A good cast in a very badly scripted and quite unbelievable (in the worst sense of the word) movie. This was an incredibly inaccurate portrayal of mental illness, if that indeed is what Helen Mirren was supposed to be portraying. She was really just one pissed off woman, which is what I'd be too if I were married to Beau Bridges' asinine character. For a much better depiction of 'not normal' watch Benny and Joon. Don't bother with this one.",1259280000,7,444,4.5625
2485831,4,B000E3K364,"From the surface, this movie is depressing, but there's nothing funny about mental illness or not finding yourself in this great big world. ""Losing Chase"" is one of those little known movies that you feel sad for because not a whole lot of people will get to see it.  Even I don't know how I came about it, but I am a huge Hellen Mirren fan ever since ""Excalibur."" She shines in this movie, but Kevin Bacon in his directorial debut shows a lot of sensitivity in portraying these two women. The other being Kyra Sedgwick who plays the young, post grad parent helper.  The setting is the gorgeous and languid Martha's Vineyard, if you've never been there, this movie will invite you to.  The begining of the movie might be a little uncomfortable to watch as young Elizabeth(Sedgwick) is introduced and humilated by Chase. Then there's the angry pre-teen son who is just as ascerbic and nasty to his mother. There's a lot of sadness in these characters because they have been  affected by mental illness,  but it's their inner strength and their kindness to each other that ultimately triumphs. Sedgwick and Mirren have that rare chemistry that true professional actors can convey on screen.  Highly recommended.",1217203200,8,1209,4.788461538461538

2485834,5,B000E3K364,"In this directorial debut of Kevin Bacon, it's clear that he knows how to get moving, in depth performances out of his actors. Helen Mirren, some ten years before she would win an Oscar, and an actress known to more savvy movie goers, gives a riveting performance of a woman deadened by her marriage - who suddenly comes to life when a young girl comes to work as a nanny to her children. Miss Mirren won a Golden Globe Award for her performance.

However, didn't expect all that much (after seeing a few dogs lately). Got hooked by a clip on Youtube. I was extremely surprised by how much I liked this film. Wasn't even available at the local vid store. There is palpable romantic tension between Kyra and Helen, enough to drive a person crazy, but it never spills into ""gratituitous groping or poor taste"". Not a lesbian film, but very enjoyable for persons of any orientation. Great drama, very human. Moves nicely, didn't want to pause it for a break. The acting (everyone involved) is really believable. The ending was bittersweet but appropriate. Easy to get totally wrapped up in each of the characters and feel for them. Beautiful writing.

Good pacing, and Beau is also quite good as the husband who loves his wife but is clueless.

Mirren plays a woman who has had a nervous breakdown. We never know why the breakdown occurs, or what led up to it, we can only guess.  She is home at their summer place on Cape Cod. Her husband played by Beau Bridges, has hired a summer mothers helper, Kyra Sedgwick. All is not good, until the middle of the film when something occurs that brings the ladies closer. The two children are opposites, Little Richard is like mom, agitates easily, blames his mom for all ills, and Jason, the artistic son, who mom dotes on.
