430213,5,6302156815,"In OSCAR, Sylvester Stallone's displays something which has not been seen before: a wonderful comic role. With a wonderful cast, this movie is  enjoyable and reminds me of ""A Comedy of Errors"" with a setting  in the 30's. Through it all, I found that I was laughing heartily and that  OSCAR is a very funny movie.
It is well worth finding this movie ... and  enjoying it over and over and over!  It may not be what the ""movie  critics"" think is delightful ... but for many of us it is fun and  delightful ... and keeps us laughing.  And that does the job for me!",966556800,,562,4.235849056603773
430214,5,6302156815,Our family loves this movie.  Every single person in the movie hams their part up to the hilt.  We watch it at least once a year and it is still funny.  I hope they release it again.,962409600,,182,3.864864864864865
430215,5,6302156815,It never slows down. We laughed all the way to the end.,956016000,,55,3.6666666666666665
430216,5,6302156815,"Honestly, Stallone is a very good comedic actor. His appecance on SNL and this movie are perfect examples. The rest of the cast is also hillarious. My only regret is that it is no longer for sale. I suggest to anyone who  see this movie for sale, to buy it right away.",954979200,,268,4.153846153846154
430217,5,6302156815,"This is a great comedy. Sylvester Stallone displays a surprising talent for comedy as a prohibition-era gangster trying to go straight. This adaptation of the original french farce keeps the idea of the original but  has been added to in order to make it more suitable as a movie. The  script-writers have done a great job and a talented cast makes the most of  it. Why some people disparage this movie, or Stallone's performance is  something which I will never understand. Watch out for excellent  performances by Chaz Palmenteri, Marisa Tomei, Tim Curry and many others.",951782400,2,573,4.927083333333333
430218,5,6302156815,"OSCAR displays Stallone's talent for portraying a comic role that is all too often overlooked for action movies. With an all-star cast to back Sly up, this movie easily floats well. A not-so-unique plot sometimes slows  this movie down, but all-in-all, OSCAR is a pretty funny movie.
Sly plays  a big-time gangster who promises his dying father (cameo by Kirk Douglas)  to go straight. This, however, proves difficult for our hero, with  drawbacks such as a mixed up mix up of little black bags, a daughter who  changes fiances three times before lunch, a bag-full of annoying visitors,  and scandalling bankers and thugs.
OSCAR's cast includes the talents of  Sylvester Stallone, Tim Curry (halarious role! ), Linda Gray, Joey  Travolta, Ornella Muti, Peter Reigert, Yvonne De Carlo, Marisa Tomei  (adorable little snotty girl), and Chazz Palminteri among many, many  others.
Although it's out-of-print, it's well worth the trouble to track  down and see!",949449600,38,956,5.183006535947713
430219,5,6302156815,This film had me laughing each of the 4 times that I saw it.  Stalone and Curry are excellent masters of the comedy.  I can hardly wait for the re-release so that I can purchase it for my collection - it is definetly a  MUST HAVE!,945820800,,230,3.9565217391304346
430220,5,6302156815,I wish people would give this movie more credit.  it is an absolutely hilarious movie.  The cast is fantastic and the storyline is great (albeit confusing).  I highly suggest it for anyone who has a need to laugh.,921628800,,213,4.552631578947368

430260,5,6302156815,"This is my all time favorite movie. And I'm not kidding. I've watched this movie so many times over the years that I have the whole thing memorized. I can honestly say ive watched it well over 1000 times since 1991. I started watching it when it first came out, and when I was young I would just rewind and rewatch over and over. It's one of the most underrated comedies out there. And filled with so much talent that it really was a shame that it was not appreciated when it first came out. If you want a pleasant surprise, watch this movie. You won't regret it.",1519430400,,563,4.222222222222222

430289,3,6302156815,For awhile Stallone tried doing some comedy's.  And I don't think any of them were hits.  This is my favorite.  And it's pretty good.  A comedy about gangster's would be kind of hard to make anyway.  Stallone does pretty good and so does Marisa Tomei  who has an accent that will drive you crazy.,1513641600,,296,4.388888888888889

His accountant wants a raise.
His elocution instructor (Tim Curry) is eyeing his daughter.

430360,5,6302156815,"If you've not seen the movie, I highly recommend that you do.  It's not your typical Sly Stallone movie.  It's a keystone cop type comedy about a gangster that goes straight to honor his papa's last wishes.  The comedic timing of Sly,  Don Ameche, Chazz Palminteri, Peter Riegert, Arleen Sorkin, Marisa Tomei, Ornella Muti, Harry Shearer and Martin Ferrero as the Finucci Brothers and (my personal favorite) Tim Curry as Dr Poole was impeccable.  It's a believable day in an unbelievably crazy household.  Most days I feel like Snaps, so much to do and trying to hard but more obstacles are thrown at you.  You can't miss this movie.  Movies like this don't come along every day.  It's in the same types of comedies like Clue and Hudson Hawk (also must sees).

All the characters were interesting, colorful, and funny, and I was laughing throughout watching this. This is the type of movie that can be watched over and over, and still remain entertaining. This is a tasteful and cute comedy. Some of the memorable lines that come to mind ""Of course I knew! I just had no idea!"", ""You're an ox and a moron!"", and ""he was an honest crook"".

There's not a lot I can say that hasn't already been said, and I won't describe the plot and concept again.  Just watch it, and I bet you will like it.  It does have a lot of references from the old crime movies and TV shows that some younger viewers might not get, but the cast works so well together you can't help but laugh anyway.  Marisa Tomei and Tim curry are excellent and there is a who's who of old movie and TV actors to look out for.",1464652800,,565,3.8869565217391306

A comedy that will please anyone that likes light-hearted dialogue, beautiful clothes and gangster cars from the 30's and 40's, with Stallone looking as good as I have ever seen him. Heck, there are actually scenes in which he smiles for the camera after some punch-line that he delivers to himself with a timing and funniness that plays like he is really enjoying himself.

431086,4,6302156815,"Oscar is a screwball comedy based on the Claude Magnier stage play. It was a remake of the 1967 French film of the same title with the settings moved to the Depression era New York City. Its central character is on a mob boss trying to go straight. It stars Sylvester Stallone in the title role.

Angelo ""Snaps"" Provolonep made a promise that he would reform his life and give up his involvement with criminal activities upon the death of his father. Unfortunately,there are a variety of personal and professional obstacles that he must go through. Among them is that he needs lots of money since he is getting married soon. His accountant asked him for a raise. Later,he discovered that his daughter got pregnant. And there are more.

Critics thrashed Oscar and compared Stallone to comedy as one movie writer would put it,""Stallone is to comedy as John Goodman is to ballet"".But despite the fact that he isn't a comic genius,he definitely can go through gags and made fun of by others without getting mad. In other words,he can tolerate how others would treat him. Unfortunately,this movie became a traumatic experience for him that he gave up comedy and never did a comedic film again. But nevertheless,it was still a funny film that would enjoy somehow.

Regarding Stallone,he was decent in comedy. Too bad that people believed the numerous critics who trashed this film.",1419120000,2,1375,4.842553191489362

431118,5,6302156815,"This is one of my all time favorite movies!  It unfortunately follows suit with my other favorite comedies that the critics didn't like it and it underperformed at the box office.  I truly believe that anything the critics say about a movie should be thrown in the trash where it belongs.  They don't enjoy entertaining movies, they only want movies that inspire deep reflection and self examination.  In short, movies that are both unfunny and difficult to watch.  This movie is neither.  It is a hoot and a half.  If you like gangster movies, particularly send-ups of gangster movies, this has it all, and is less risqu than Johnny Dangerously (another legendary comedy BTW).  My family has sat together and repeatedly enjoyed watching Oscar.  We quote many of the funniest lines all the time, decades later.  I truly regret Sylvester Stallone's treatment by the press for this movie, because he is absolutely brilliant.  The timing is perfect throughout, and the story delivers a non-stop barrage of laughs from beginning to end.  Watch it and thank me later.  At the very least, this movie deserves a cult following like other under-appreciated classics like Clue.",1416441600,,1168,4.989637305699482

Oscar features a very dry humor and Vaudevillian delivery, all with a frantic pace reminiscent of the film adaption of Clue. The casting is perfect, with some great character actors providing support, such as Harry Shearer and Kurtwood Smith, and some serious star power in the form of Sylvester Stallone and Marisa Tomei, plus some of the all-time greats lending story support without taking over, including Kirk Douglas, Chazz Palimtieri, and the incomparable Tim Curry.

431363,5,6302156815,"Back in the 90s, Sylvester Stallone made a few forays into comedy and thereby demonstrated that he actually has incredibly good comic timing. ""Oscar"" is one of those comedies, and it is not only one of his very best movies but also one of the best ensemble comedies I've ever seen.

Stallone plays Angelo ""Snaps"" Provolone, an incredibly wealthy 1920s-era bootlegger and gangster who promises his dying father (played in a brief cameo by Kirk Douglas!) that he will go straight--he'll give up crime and begin a new life as an honest man. Accordingly, he sets up an appointment with some bankers to discuss his new life as an investor with them. But there will be a few hiccups on that road to honest living, starting with some secrets his handsome young accountant (brilliantly played by Vincent Spano), imperious Irish maid Nora, and spoiled-brat poor-little-rich-girl daughter all need to tell him right now, and all the while, the cops are spying on him so they can get enough dirt on him to arrest him.

The central conceit to the movie is a switcheroo routine with a couple of valises, and I cringe whenever that's onscreen, but the rest of the movie is hilarious and fun to watch thanks to a talented cast that works stupendously well together. Snaps' wife, Sofia, is played with deadly intensity by Ornella Muti; her voice ranges from delicately feminine to thunderously matriarchal at the drop of a hat, and it's very clear she's lost not a single bit of her allure since her dangerous princess days from ""Flash Gordon."" Tim Curry plays a speech therapist/coach who gets drawn into the family's drama-of-the-day; his cheerful, reserved professor is very clearly out of his element entirely when confronted with Snaps' wily daughter (played by Marisa Tomei, obviously enjoying the heck out of herself). Peter Riegert plays a pitch-perfect second-in-command and straight man running a household of crooks and thieves (including Chazz Palminteri as a dense-as-an-ox goon). Martin Ferrero and Harry Shearer show up as a pair of high-end tailors and Don Ameche sails in a couple of times as a bewildered priest. William Atherton plays his usual stuffy, snobby cad as the head of the bankers.

With several subplots and a constantly-changing-hands maguffin shell game going on, it's a chaotic, frenetic movie with a lot to pay attention to, the sort of movie that'll surprise you with new things upon every re-watching. But without Stallone's talent to pull them all together, it would be excruciating. As it is, he handles his role with aplomb--he's fascinating to watch as he navigates the trials of the most stressful day of his life.

I recommend this movie wholeheartedly. With no offensive elements (beyond the stereotyping of Italian-Americans), no sex, no violence, and only the barest hints of scandal, this is one the entire family can enjoy.",1395446400,,2854,4.989495798319328

""Oscar"" takes place in the '30's, mainly in the mansion of Snaps Provolone (Sylvester Stallone), with plenty of tasteful, stage-y period detail.  Everyone in the ensemble cast is spot-on. Tim Curry is perfect as the elocution professor, as are Maris Tomei as the worldly-but-naive daughter, and Ornella Muti as Snaps' beautiful, fiery wife.  Although the humor revolves around a ""reformed"" Italian mob-boss and his spoiled daughter, a young lady who claims to be in the maternal way via the family chauffeur, the jokes aren't sleazy, just genuinely hilarious.",1388707200,,799,5.162790697674419

You may need to view this movie a number of times before you catch the little details but that always makes it more fun!
Like the Court Jester (with Danny Kaye) the movie is preceeded with the summary of the tale, though unlike the Court Jester, Oscar's prologue is done by an Italian-singing, claymation figure.  Feel free to skip: it's wierd.

The cast in this movie is excellent, and the comedic timing of all is right on. The critics didn't like it because it was Stallone doing this film. I think he pulled it off and showed he had talent to do more than shoot and fight in a movie.  The film in many ways was like those great comedies from the 40's screwball comedy I think they were called. Fast pace dialog, pulled off very well. If you enjoy humor that can be found in good word play, this is a good movie to watch. It is one of those movies you put on when you need a laugh. It doesn't pretend to be some great epic film like Gone With the Wind, it is a movie that laughs at itself, and it is exactly what it is supposed to be FUN.",1359763200,,908,3.9347826086956523

431853,5,6302156815,"Oscar (1991) has many elements that helped maintain Hollywood's reputation
world-wide... in the way it outclassed 90% of competing movies.

First, the most astonishing element, is Sylvester Stallone
literally carrying the picture on his shoulders for nearly two
hours. The action-film type-cast actor (Rambo, Rocky,
Demolition Man,Judge Dredd, Copland) tryies his hand at a romantic
comedy,  and succeeds in all aspects.

Secondly, the visual transformation to the era between 1920 to 1933
(before the repeal of Prohibition) is simply phenomenal. The styles of
clothes, the automobiles, the store fronts, the buildings, the
mannerisms  of people... all that is there to convince the public
they are witnessing those times. The only inside-joke, that
contradicts this, is a 3 minute segment, perhaps improvized on the
piano, with Vincent Spano  on the keys, playing a Rock 'n' Roll
style number, joined by Peter Riegert, since this would only happen
40 years later.

Thirdly, the roster of ""A"" actors are many ...the genuine and real
presence of  Marisa Tomei, and touchness of Chazz Palminteri as
Stallone's right hand man,  the dramatic and natural European
touch of Ornella Muti..who plays Stallone's wife ...all combine for
great carisma on screen. Vincent Spano's work meets expectations
as well, as well as Linda Gray's (also known as Sue Ellen Ewing, of
course on TV, a short segment with Kirk Douglas (reminiscent here, of
Anthony Quinn's style, etc.) Admittedly, Tim Curry's quirky character
struggles to ""fit in"" with the others, but manages in the end to do so.

Fourth, the dynamism of this movie is impressive... as is the comic
element, the two combining to make this a classic American production,
never taking itself too seriously.

I would have given 5/5 for this movie, except for the minor aspect
of the script, that had such a large number of unexpected twists
and turns, and surprises  that the public may undergo exhaustion and
confusion after 90 mins, despite all the favorable aforementioned elements.

Finally, the audio soundtrack is made up of a many fine numbers
..from start to finish ..the  video quality of the filming, editing
top-notch.

In sum, Oscar deserves 4.5 over 5 ...but here, 5/5 to round out the
score.",1336262400,,2244,5.162983425414365

431857,2,6302156815,"Before I get slammed for such a low rating, let me explain.

This is one of my all-time Top Five Favorite Comedies.  I can watch it at any time, and know I'm going to laugh.  The jokes are witty and quick, reminding me of the Marx Brothers films.  It's 109 minutes of rapid-fire jokes that actually took intelligence to write.  Comedy like this is so rare in today's infatuation with gross-out humor (i.e, anything by the no-talent Seth Rogan).

That being said, the DVD release is a joke.  It has the film, the trailer, and nothing else.  With such a stellar cast of funny people, nobody could even find a blooper/gag reel?  Seriously?  No commentary?  No deleted scenes?  Not even a reference to the original French film?

NOTHING!  This DVD is one of the worst ever realeased.  I had hoped there would be a 20th Anniversary release (in 2011) which included all this stuff.  Sadly, it didn't happen.  I, and many others, can only hope that the Blu-Ray release isn't so disappointing.",1331251200,2,985,4.633720930232558

This proves to be more difficult then it sounds when on the first day, a mess of complications lead ""Snaps"" into Family Problems, Business Problems, and Legal Problems.

Absolutely hysterical and safe for kids to watch. (There are a few, more grown up implications, but nothing is seen or discussed in detail.)

No swearing.

431921,5,6302156815,"I remember seeing ""Oscar"" when it was in the theatres in 1991.  The critics heaved a collective yawn.  When I saw it there was a group of mentally challenged people in the audience laughing hysterically throughout.  I was laughing along with them.  Why has this terrific film fallen into relative obscurity?  My guess is that people don't normally associate the action oriented Sylvester Stallone in a broad comic vehicle.  But if one follows the trajectory of his career this is not the first time that Stallone has extended himself into the comic realm.  No, I'm not talking about ""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot"" which I haven't seen but was heaped with almost universal disdain, fair or unfair.  In 1978 Stallone adapted his serio-comic novel ""Paradise Alley"" to the big screen and I thought it was a terrifically offbeat film.  ""Oscar"", however, is a collaborative effort between star and director.  John Landis is trying to evoke the breathlessness of classic screwball comedy of Hawks, Sturgis, and Wilder and it works to a tee.  The film is replete with mistaken identities, switched bags, and slamming doors and in lesser hands would be cliched but it works here to a tee.  Stallone is in perfect synch with his director and his gangster attempting to go legitimate, Angelo ""Snaps"" Provolone, anchors the film's breakneck pace.  The film also has a great ensemble cast notably Marisa Tomei, in an early part, as Snaps' randy daughter and Tim Curry as Snaps' elocutionist.  I think the greatest compliment you can pay a film is that some part of it stays in your subconscious.  There's a throwaway line Snaps' henchman Aldo (Peter Riegert) says to a German chauffeur that became part of my everyday vernacular.  Upon entering Snaps' living room Aldo implores the chauffeur to ""Sitten Sie"".",1296518400,3,1792,4.923333333333333

431963,5,6302156815,"Okay, I do think that Sly has managed to produce two fairly good comedies in his career (and we'll just ignore the mind-numbingly disastrous STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT, shall we?). Surprisingly, I enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rhinestone/dp/B00076ONTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rhinestone</a>&nbsp;for Sly's fish-out-of-water turn as a country singer-in-training. And the gangster farce OSCAR is actually one of my favorite Stallone flicks. I don't know how many folks have heard of OSCAR (I'm betting, not many), but it sure slipped way under the radar when it came out back in '91. I'm thinking people were probably turned off because it featured Sly in something other than the expected action adventure genre. Well, people missed out, because OSCAR is hilarious.

OSCAR is based on the 1967 French comedy classic of the same name, that one starring the brilliant Louis de Funes. Check that one out, too, if you get the chance. But, in this American version, the year is 1931, deep in the days of the Depression and Prohibition, and Chicago mobster Angelo ""Snaps"" Provolone is about to mend his ways (he'd promised on his father's deathbed). OSCAR takes place mostly in Snaps's opulent mansion and covers one very chaotic morning in Snaps's life. This is the day when Snaps officially goes straight, you see, as he's about to smoothly transition into the banking business. But, to follow in the screwball comedy tradition, it just ain't that easy. Not when he has to face a thieving accountant (his own), a pregnant daughter (who's not pregnant), another girl passing herself off as his daughter, confused henchmen, bewildered FBI agents, lost loves, and three frustrating black bags who seemingly have minds of their own. Man, some days, it's just really hard to quit the thuggery business...

Note: For the curious, by the way, Oscar is the name of the much absent chauffer who used to work for Snaps. He's not much in the movie.

The secret, I think, is that OSCAR doesn't put too much pressure on Stallone to carry the entire load. The bit characters are wonderful and are allowed many opportunities to grab the spotlight comedically. Too many supporting actors to mention, but stand-outs are Peter Riegert and Chazz Palminteri, who simply kill it as Sly's henchmen, Tim Curry as the Henry Higgins-like elocution guru, and Harry Shearer and Martin Ferrero as the meek Finucci Brothers. Stallone is pretty much relegated to a straight man role, although he does induce a share of the laughs. Sly is often times caught in reaction mode as the much put-upon master of his domain, so there's plenty of that thing at which John Wayne used to excel later in his career, which is delivering those martyred slow burns and blustery double takes. Early in the film, on the verge of hearing some unpleasant news, Snaps Provolone mutters: ""This doesn't bode well."" Thankfully, for us, the reformed hoodlum was right.

There's a lot going on in this film, plot wise; you do have to keep your eyeballs stuck on the screen, or you're bound to miss a curve or a gag. OSCAR tries for that 1930s screwball type of rhythm and nuttiness, and mostly achieves it (Riegert is particularly good with his lines). Also lending to that feel are the Damon Runyonesque names which pop up (Snaps Provolone, Johnny Elbows, Louis ""the Lug"" McGurk, etc.). The movie feels a bit like a busy stage play in the sense that most of the scenes take place in Snaps' digs, with lots of doors opening and closing and the harried Stallone going up and down the stairs, and giving the illusion of constantly being in motion.

Really, give this one a try. I think you'll like it and you'll laugh quite a bit. And near the end, don't be too surprised if you find yourself grinning amiably as one of Snaps' less plank-headed henchmen proclaims: ""This day has been an emotional rollercoaster.""",1221091200,,3906,4.993855606758832

Has that status changed in the decade-and-a-half since the film's theatrical release?  Based on the majority of reviews found here, I'd say the answer is an emphatic 'yes!'

Look, my loyal pee-pees, the sad truth is that when Sly turned to comedy in the early-90s, he was looked at as wanting to expand his fanbase the way Arnold did in the late-80s beginning with the movie ""Twins.""  People forget that Sly was in a very funny comedy called ""Rhinestone"" way back in 1984.  Comedy was nothing new to him.  ""Oscar"" was a broad farce, well directed by John Landis.  It features a great ensemble cast.  Sly is often sort of a straight man to the much more colorful supporting characters, but it needs to be pointed out that he carries the movie with a light, effective comic touch.

1.  The cast is great!  Sly Stallone really surprised me in this comedic role as a gangster that he played wonderfully well.  Dom Ameche plays a priest in this movie in what has to be one of the last roles he played before he died.  Marisa Tomei is in this before she won the real oscar and became famous, and the supporting cast is a list only.

2.  If you love plot twists that will keep you guessing, this is a great movie.

432015,5,6302156815,"A delightful light comedy, if there ever was one. Sylvester Stallone plays the relatively 'straight' man in this movie, but has his funny moments...he plays his role, as the ganster with a tender heart, to perfection. Peter Reigert as the smart-aleck bodyguard-turned butler (told by Stallone  ""You're a butler now...buttle!"") is hugely entertaining. Chaz Palminteiri as the moronic (or as Stallone puts it ""you're an ox & a moron"") bodyguard is a scream, growing on the audience as the movie goes on. The supporting cast including Marisa Tomei, Kirk Douglas, Don Ameche & others, all do a stand-up job.

The script is a gem...a laugh-a-line variety. The production values are great, and John Landis has excelled in directing this great comedy.

Why it did not become a huge hit is incomprehensible, but its non-performance at the box-office should not be a deterrent...trust me, this one is a winner!!!",1125878400,,903,5.087837837837838

""Oscar'""s written very much in the French farce style, with people coming in and out of the scenes contstantly, funny names, outrageous coincedences, etc. Terrific performances by Marisa Tomei, Vincent Spano, Peter Reigert, and even Sly Stallone, who I was prepared to hate.
 This is a wonderful, laugh out loud comedy, with very little if no cursing, suitable for watching with your teenage kids. I would probably buy it off the Wal-Mart super bargain rack to save a few bucks, though.",1121126400,2,738,4.803149606299213
432048,4,6302156815,"John Landis scored big with his spoof of high finance magnates ""Trading Places"" and revisits similar terrain in ""Oscar,"" only this time the big money was made in the crime syndicate field.  Landis shrewdly sets his satire in the Depression period to provide for the same kind of contrast between rich and poor that he showcased in ""Trading Places"", when Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche wagered to see what will happen when poor African American Eddie Murphy is allowed into their world to make business decisions.

In ""Oscar"" the story begins in a scene where Don Ameche appears again, but this time as family priest saying the last rites for syndicate tycoon Kirk Douglas.  Former Universal siren Yvonne De Carlo is also in the scene, which provides an interesting opening to the film as Douglas implores son Sylvester Stallone to get out of the crime business and go legitimate, slapping him several times in a robust closing act to dramatically make his point.

When Douglas passes on loyal son Stallone, despite misgivings, agrees to give up his criminal enterprise.  When an important meeting is scheduled with bankers we see a hilarious study in contrasts as Stallone's old hoods have great difficulty shaking their old personas and behaving like gentlemen.

While Stallone encounters problems enough with the transition to business executive his accountant tells him he wants a raise because he is in love and wants to marry Stallone's daughter.  Stallone becomes enraged and states that the fiance in question is not actually his daughter.  Meanwhile his own daughter that he acknowledges, who wants to move out from under the suffocating enclosure of the family mansion under her father's constant thumb, begins making marriage noises of his own.

Stallone is forced to constantly shift gears, all the while bemoaning that his concentration is being disrupted on the day of his important meeting with leading bankers who will  propel him out of the crime field.  When the identity shifts and strategic jockeying reaches a crescendo it reminds one of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello's ""Whose on First?"" routine.

Eventually former Stallone mansion domestic Linda Gray of ""Dallas"" television fame surfaces.  She makes a startling announcement near the film's conclusion that clears up identity problems in a manner that shocks Stallone.",1106956800,20,2336,5.148148148148148
432049,5,6302156815,"Obviously, Stop or My Mom Will Shoot did not do much for Stallone's comedic career.  This film, however, does not have a flaw.  The cast and the comic timing are superior.  Tim Curry plays a linguistics expert, trying to teach Stallone (who has a Gangster accent) how to speak properly.  His straight man in the midst of a wonderful farce, is one of his best roles.  Chaz Palminteiri and Peter Riegert are hilarious as Snaps Provolone's (Stallone) right-hand goons.  The presentation of this film makes it easy to see the original stage-performance of this screenplay.  A classic early 20th century comedy, it is ripe with misunderstandings, mistaken identities, and errors compounding on top of one another.

If you like slapstick comedies that are based on one day, in one place such as Clue and Radioland Murders, you will love this. This isn't a mystery like those, but the confusion over everything in one morning is overwhelming to ""Snaps"" Provolone. And he can't even kill anybody anymore.
It's his first day of ""going straight"" from the gangster life of the early 30's during prohibition and people are already seemlingly taking advantage of that right away.
This is filled with hilarious dialogue and is delivered perfectly by everyone. Yes, even Stallone. And you felt so proud when Chazz was ahead of everyone else after not knowing a thing about a thing.

Bad actors would have turned this script into a horrible movie, but together the strength of the script and the strength of the actors in their respective roles is excellent.

The basic plot is that when ""Snaps"" Provalone's (Stallone) dad is on his deathbed, he makes ""Snaps"" promise that he'll 'go straight' and stop being a gangster.  Of course this proves to be extremely difficult...especially in light of his suddenly ""pregnant"" daughter, a fake daughter who turns out to be a real daughter, and the new maid who happens to be the now real daughter's mother who disappeared long ago!

However on this morning all sorts of crazy things happen involving his Accountant, Daughter, a woman claiming to be his Daughter, his wife, the Maid, and the hired guns as the main focus ends up being on a black bag full of jewels.

Although Sylverster Stallone is better known for his action roles, I've never enjoyed him more than as the mobster who's trying to go straight while also dealing with the craziness surrounding him.  This movie has an outstanding supporting cast (especially Chazz Palminteri and Tim Curry) who pull off all the craziness like pros.  It may not be the most sophisticated movie ever, but it is one of the funniest, if you don't mind a few cliches.  Definitely worth watching!",1058140800,3,663,4.681034482758621

432099,5,6302156815,"Talk about a comedy with non-stop twists and surprises, ""Oscar"" is a hilarious movie that keeps you laughing throughout.  You even feel quite exhausted after it's all said and done since there's so much going on.  This has always been a favorite of mine, and I'm glad to see that it has finally found its way on DVD.
I'm going to be very brief when going over the storyline.  The great thing about the movie is being surprised minute by minute.  The basic story is about ""Snaps"" Provolone, a powerful Chicago gangster that is feared by many.  However, Snaps is about to go straight because he promised his dying father on his deathbed that he would go legit.  However, it's not going to be easy.  In only 24 hours of trying to be straight, everything goes straight  to hell, and everything that could go wrong does.  And that's when all of the fun begins.
This is a terrific comedy that can be enjoyed by just about everyone.  It's only PG, so it's something that even the whole family can enjoy.  Sylvester Stallone can really be a card and is hilarious when given the right opportunity.  His facial expressions and outbursts are truly unforgettable.  And there's so many great people in this out-of-control loony bin (many that you'll recognize in a heart-beat).
The movie has a lot of brains too.  For a comedy it is extremely complex and well-thought out.  John Landis does a terrific job of directing this movie.  The screenplay is brilliantly funny and very surprising with every step.  You'll find yourself repeating many of the lines as you watch this over and over again.
The DVD really doesn't have much to offer, but for a movie like this there's really no need to have a lot of special features (it would've been nice to have SOME though!).  There's not even a theatrical trailer, so be warned.  The picture and sound quality is pretty good (nice to see that it's enhanced for 16x9 TVs).  So, it could've been a better DVD, but in all honesty I'm just glad to see that it is finally on DVD.
""Oscar"" is an outstanding comedy that proves that a movie can be funny and smart at the same time.  Bring the family and enjoy the chaos that happens in this crazy circus of gangsters, not-so-smart hit-men, crooked accountants, snobbish bankers, frustrated cops, confused priests, and more.  ""Oscar"" is definitely worth checking out, especially if you want to have a great time and laugh like crazy.  You really will be surprised if you have not seen this movie yet, so give it a shot!",1054166400,16,2488,4.6045454545454545
432100,5,6302156815,"This is one of the most underrated movies in the history of modern (post 1950) cinema!  People stayed away in droves because they didn't trust Stallone to carry a comedy, but he and his fantastic ensemble take an already delicious farce and elevate it even beyond the source material.  See why Peter Reigert, Chazz Palminteri, and Marisa Tomei even have careers!  It's a classic farce, with snappy dialogue and delish production design too.  I'm getting two just on principle.",1050451200,,476,4.987341772151899

How, in the name of all that's good and funny, did this movie ever flop at the box office??  Stellar cast, comedy of errors, mistaken identities, and a funny script make this movie one of those ""You gotta see it!"" rentals.  Better yet, now that it's coming out on DVD, BUY IT!!  The best example of other comedy movies that I can think of that are similar to ""Oscar"" would be anything by the Marx Bros.  (ie ""Duck Soup"").  I first saw this flick on a flight back from overseas and there wasn't one person who wasn't laughing.  Well, there was one, but 5mins after I woke him up and slapped some headphones on him, he was laughing right along with the rest of us.",1049068800,,754,4.3428571428571425

Stallone's wonderful performance in a non-action was a pleasant surprise, ...  I am a big fan of dramatic irony (ie the audience is aware of things that the characters are not) and the plot gets more and more twisted every second.  Oscar falls into the ""mixed-up identity"" catagory along with A Midsummer Night's Dream, Twelfth Night, The Clandestine Marriage, Sibling Rivalry, and Three to Tango.  If you enjoy movies that twist and turn as people who thought they knew what was going on, find out they really don't have a clue, then Oscar is for you.  Trying to explain the plot would be futile, within 20 minutes it's more complicated than a soap opera!  The tip of the iceberg is that Stallone plays a gangster who promises his dying father that he will stop shaming the family and become an honest man. The whole movie takes place on his first day at attempting to grant his father's dying wish.  Watch the first 5 minutes and I guarantee you'll be hooked.",1045785600,,1110,4.656410256410257

The fact he gets waken up early in the morning only to find out ""the thug"" accountant was stealing from him cracks me up because I can understand the feeling of being wakened for nothing. This movie is believable, for I would ""be angry"" at the visitor that woke me too early in the morning. I believe this movie to be a good adaption of the 'French Farce' genre theme.  It gives the viewer many obstacles to overcome as the story goes along it gets even more twisted with numerious visitors, mixing of items, mixing up of people, mixing up of mysterious family members which appear out of the wood work at the wrong time as the police are watching the house for the priest comming to the house and the speach proffessor is giving lessons as the daugther is faking her pregnancy and much more.  This movie is an ongoing process of visitors and activities it never stops...from beginning to end it is a delightful pleasure to watch keeping the interest not just in the acting but in the story line...for the story line is what drives this movie along.
