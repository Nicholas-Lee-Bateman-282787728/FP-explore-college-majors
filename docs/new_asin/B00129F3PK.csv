8244813,5,B00129F3PK,"Stroker & Hoop was pure genius, with just enough parody quality to still keep it genuine.  What show have you seen where they go back in time to kill santa clause. Howabout a beauty pageant where all the contestants die being made into food.  The people have spoken, and they want more stroker & hoop!",1368921600,,301,4.454545454545454
8244814,5,B00129F3PK,"This is one of the all-time most underrated Adult Swim shows, and one of my all-time favorites. 13 episodes of hilarity. Jon Glaser's best voice work (frankly I think he's wasting his own talents with Delocated where he modulates his excellent voice)as Stroker and Tim Levitch as Hoop is a perfect combo.

Stroker is the most hilariously deplorable protagonist in just about any show ever. He's every bit as self-absorbed and chauvinistic as H. Jon Benjamin's Sterling Archer, except without any of the good looks, money, or talent.

Let's cut to the quick here, Adult Swim. You've got to get this on DVD. I will pay you for it. You've done right by many deserving short-lived shows in this way: Frisky Dingo, Mission Hill, The Oblongs, and Lucy Daughter of the Devil to name a few.

But you have also created a world in which you can buy the likes of Xavier: Renegade Angel, Eagleheart, and Saul of the Molemen on DVD, but not Stroker and Hoop. Time to own up to that egregious mistake.",1358294400,,987,4.628571428571429
8244815,5,B00129F3PK,"There is not much else to say other than stroker and hoop was a brilliant show. it was one of adult swims better cartoons that relied on clever humor rather than shock and toilet humor. This is by far one of my favorite cartoons of all time next to futurama and home movies.

On one hand i hope they revive it from cancellation, but on the other hand shows like futurama and family guy's new episodes never lived up to there pre-cancellation shows.

btw i believe you can find the stroker and hoop episodes at the itunes store.",1293321600,,527,4.36734693877551
8244816,5,B00129F3PK,"Stroker and Hoop, shown on Adult Swim (on Cartoon Network) is a hilarious cartoon, on par with the best of the comedy cartoons out (Family Guy, Simpsons, South Park, Venture Bros, etc).  I try to watch it every night on cartoon network, where it is now shown at 12pm CST.  The likeable characters, well scripted humor, and lack of predictable humor makes this show a refreshing and funny show.  Comparable to many other shows, it has yet to get old with each episode playing out differently while maintaining its best qualities.  It is an absolute shame it was canceled, especially considering the garbage that passes as acceptable TV.  Heck, even 'The Hills' on MTV got more than one season, and that is pure televised crap.  I hope for the day it can be released on DVD, I would buy it in an instant.  Until then, watch it on adult swim on cartoon network and hope its DVD release comes soon.",1255996800,6,894,4.55
8244817,4,B00129F3PK,"For all the DVD garbage mass produced(read my less than positive opinion of Tim and Eric)its a shame that a show as funny as this hasn't been released by Adult Swim, let alone kept on the air. Its definitely not high brow humor but its difficult to sit through more than a few minutes without laughing at something going on. There is enough crap on Adult Swim(see 12oz. mouse, Tim and Eric, Assy Mcgee) it should be a no brainer to keep this on.",1223337600,7,445,4.309523809523809
