8700517,1,B00T65T8T4,"Sorry, this review is not about the film itself, it's a classic. This disk is Region B and will not play on American Blu Ray DVD players. Why is it not specified that this Is Region B DVD and does not work in U.S. Blu Ray players? In small print on the back of the case is the only place this is shown. I received this as a Christmas gift and can't watch it. This information should at least be listed in the item details.",1449273600,4,422,3.976470588235294

""Zombi 2"" is the same film as Zombie. That much we've figured out. There's also a ""Zombi 3"" and a ""Zombi 4."" What some reviewers have asked is where is the missing chapter? So here goes.

Zombie Flesh Eaters,This is the Australian Release,but beware This is a review by Geoff M.
Its a top print if your interested.

When George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" was released in Italy, it was released under the name ""Zombi."" ""Zombi 2"" was written before Dawn, but was slightly changed to cash in on Romero's success. Thus, rather than call it ""Zombi"" again, they stuck on a ""2,"" making it seem like a sequel.

When ""Zombi 2"" was released in the U.S., the name was changed once again, this time to ""Zombie.""

The UK & Australian title was Zombie Flesh Eaters.

And the confusion ends. Thanks Geoff.",1429920000,3,858,4.545454545454546
