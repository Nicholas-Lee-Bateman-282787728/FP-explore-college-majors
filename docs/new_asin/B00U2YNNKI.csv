7028152,1,B00U2YNNKI,"Seemlessly blends the idea of Kevin Costner's The Postman's lead villain and gang, with the idea of Escape from New York's Snake Plisken and the opening scene of 2013's Lockdown (with Guy Pearce) plus a splash of Firefly's RIver Tam into an all new craptastic microbudget c-movie. But, if you are a fan of c-movies and the sci-fi genres, you might find this worth waiting for on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Definitely don't pay for it. But, hat's off to the writer, who is clearly a big movie buff! :)",1441756800,4,498,4.544444444444444
7028153,2,B00U2YNNKI,"The plot is not cohesive, the acting is slightly worse than I'd expect in a good high school play, and the special effects aren't worth much at all. For all of that, this thing an honest if low-budget attempt at an original story. I can appreciate that. Character exposition stinks, too.",1441411200,,287,4.647058823529412

7028156,1,B00U2YNNKI,OMG..My psyche has been scarred for life after watching just 20 minutes of this unbelievably horrid piece of junk.,1439078400,,114,5.052631578947368
7028157,5,B00U2YNNKI,"This is not a mega-million dollar Summer Blockbuster, this is something better.  This is a throw back to those 1980s post-nuclear war flicks like Escape From New York or Warriors of the Apocalypse.  A movie made with more talent than bucks.  Director Richard Marr-Griffin can do with a few thousand dollars what the major studios can't do with an unlimited budget.  The action moves fast and brutal (sometimes very brutal) without using Matrix style fight editing.  The story has respect for classic B-Movies without trying to be a reboot of something else.  You would have seen this movie on your Mom & Pop video rental store shelves alongside Hell Comes to Frogtown and Death Race 2000 (original) back in the day and made a double or triple feature of it.  The DVD cover is cool, but it's a little slick for what you'll get (this is a micro-budget film after all) so I'm also including in this review my scan of the artwork that came with my purchase of the film direct from Marr-Griffin.  This is independent movies the way they should be.  Enjoy.
One of the other reviews commented that there was no trailer, so I found one.

7028158,1,B00U2YNNKI,"I was unable to watch any more than half of this film. It wasn't released, it escaped: There is simply nothing redeeming about it, no diamond in the rough. Technically, it's awful: The sound, Foley, lighting, camera work, and acting are on par with an average first year film student's work. The film is full of used, cliche psuedo-vaudeville gimmicks (two idiots trying to go through a doorway at the same time getting stuck, a character who plays the part of a 'human dog', etc). The guns are obviously air and toy guns in some shots (this should be anything but obvious), the effects are stock, the props at best are mediocre, at worst badly made. The only chance of survival for this cinematic marvel would have been a slight rewrite to make it into a B-list comedic-horror-parody of itself and films of this kind. There isn't a solitary spark of creative thinking or effort evident anywhere.",1437868800,6,896,4.713375796178344
7028159,1,B00U2YNNKI,"Bad script, bad acting.  Could not watch more than 5 minutes.  Guess there is a reason there is not preview.  IMBd gave it a rating of 7.2, I think somebody is just taking money for reviews now.",1437609600,,194,4.1891891891891895
7028160,4,B00U2YNNKI,"I'm really shocked about the quality of this one. I typically enjoy schlock horror films, and that's why I ordered this ... but it actually has a surprising good script, great cast and characters you actually give a s*** about. Warning ... it does get pretty damn violent in places, but that's par for the course of post-apocalyptic movies. I recommend it!",1437523200,4,356,4.758064516129032
7028161,2,B00U2YNNKI,"Just about what I expected, predictable. Because the script was so bad it made he rest seem almost tolerable. Most interesting part is the cover to the left.",1437523200,,157,4.642857142857143

7028164,4,B00U2YNNKI,"If they had tagged this as a possible comedy, I would have believed it.  The story line wasn't *that* bad but did leave something to be desired.  The actors had to be decent to really screw up this movie - the acting was over done,
As I said, if they'd called it a comedy that'd have been just about right!",1502582400,,306,4.083333333333333

7028166,2,B00U2YNNKI,"LOL, I stopped the movie to see what year it was made, I was thinking 1983  VHS rental fodder. Amazon has 2016 listed. Im not sure if it was mislabeled or created for a deep, deep, deeeep eastern European market.

7028167,2,B00U2YNNKI,"They tried to go mad max here with the crazy dog boy and crazy dragon girl, all shiny and bright, ""Swim, swim, swim..."" stuff but it needed a more grainy texture to the film to pull it off.

This movie was absolutely horrible. Believe the majority reviews. I didn't and wasted my money. The acting was worst than terrible. I was glad I had fast forward.",1491523200,,183,5.133333333333334
7028177,4,B00U2YNNKI,"This Movie is more about FUN that perfection.  If you go into this looking for Star Wars or Some shiny Disney film, you will miss the point of this film entirely.  It is designed to be cliche' and imitate the classic 1980s genre.  In other words, if you let yourself just enjoy a good B movie such as this one, you will.  If you demand THE ABSOLUTE BEST QUALITY!!  for the giant sump you just plopped down to watch the film, you will miss the point.  Decent special effects, Enjoyable acting, some pretty good campy humor there and actually some kind of riveting action.  Great little flick.",1458777600,,591,4.4672897196261685

7028179,4,B00U2YNNKI,"Generally speaking, quite a well done film.  It's clearly paying homage to 80's Apocalypse flicks.  The script is well put together, the story moves along, and though several cast members were truly deplorable actors, most performances put in were solid.  Steven O'Broin (who just won Best Supporting Actor at Rhode Island Comic Con for this film) was the biggest standout, with Nat Sylva also putting in a great performance.  Take it for what it is, and you'll enjoy it.  I'd recommend it to my friends.",1447200000,,504,4.882352941176471

7028195,1,B00U2YNNKI,"Horrible waste of time.  I am going to be charitable and disregard the poor (1950's done in a basement) special effects, and I imagine one or two of the actors do actually have some talent.  But the entire film makes you want to either go suck on a revolver, or throw things at the screen.  The writing and directing in this film is rock bottom awful.  ALL the characters come across as buffoonish and plastic.  Note to the writer and director, kindly on your next film try at least a little bit to make at least ONE of the characters likable.  I LOVE Sci Fi... and have watched more than my share of both good and bad films in the genre.... but this movie is just crap.",1444435200,2,670,4.2362204724409445

7028200,4,B00U2YNNKI,"OK, when I got this title I did not know it was a low budget film, so on that point I was disappointed. I have to admit I just bypassed the most of the film and went to the last of the scene, it was a little tough to get through.

So figured I had the DVD and decided to watch the commentary.  Now most times this is usually the director commenting on the shots, and what he was thinking, and the artistic quality of each shot.

Not so in this this Commentary!!! It was the director, producer, and like 6 other cast and crew just commenting, and I do have to say it was a lot of fun  They were talking, joking and laughing of what they did for this film.  I felt like they were in a living room, discussing, and every once in a while referring to the film.  This was top notch and fun and I added 3 stars because of it

So in conclusion, the movie 1 star, the commentary, 3 stars, for my 4 star review.",1442534400,,902,3.923076923076923

I am also a movie nut and I'd watch just about anything.

I felt compelled to voice my displeasure.
Had this been scripted, performed and recorded by eight year old children,
it would not have even garnered one star if they'd thrown in a participation trophy.
