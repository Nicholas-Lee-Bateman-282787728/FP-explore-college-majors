8150348,5,B000JGW4N6,"This was a beautiful portrayal of Christs love for the world. A must see, and profound, contemplative and well written.",1386547200,,119,5.0
8150349,1,B000JGW4N6,"We purchased this movie in a Christian bookstore, however, the title is misleading...It's not a Christian movie at all, nor does it depict Christian values, salvation in Jesus Christ, or the mercy and grace of God.  Totally secular movie.  Horrible subject matter.  I recommend Flywheel or Facing the Giants.  Don't waste your money on this one.",1243900800,,345,5.107142857142857
8150350,4,B000JGW4N6,I'm sorry but the reviewer who said 99% of prostitutes were abused as children has no clue. Where did you get your info? The number is much lower than that. We just like money and we can't help it that all our clients are married. We got cheated on over & over & realized we can make a living off of it. Oldest profession.,1231891200,,322,4.046875
8150351,4,B000JGW4N6,"why not - after overly complex, multi-layered, complicated, sophisticated art house movies that leave you wondering what they and life are all about - this movie is, despite the, at times, bad acting, refreshing in its straightforwardness and simplicity. The message is clear - and - love does conquer all. And that may be the only measure at the time of death - how much did you selflessly love, who knows.....but that is where faith comes in.
It is just that, in our times and our social environment, sacrificial love is frowned upon as dysfunctional and co-dependent on the intellectual, liberal side and tolerant of sin on the evangelical side. Read the Gospels - Jesus fraternized with exactly those that our upstanding religious pillars of our communities (evangelical as well as protestant as well as catholic) condemn and shun as sinners.
for the un-obfuscated simplicity of this message I give this movie 4 stars.....",1230681600,,926,5.01948051948052
8150352,1,B000JGW4N6,"Although the acting was stiff and the screenwriting stilted, the movie made a few good points about unconditional love. I liked the way Josh taught Violet the difference between sex and making love -- not by making love to her, but by not making love to her -- simply by acting loving to her until she knew without a doubt that he loved her.

Then the movie made a U-turn at the end and turned into an abstinence sermon. They could have done so much with this film, and instead, they used it to preach.

Especially I disliked that the screenwriter painted Violet as a prostitute not because of having been wounded but because she liked money and power, despite the fact that we know that 99% of prostitutes are prostitutes because they were sexually abused as children (and the other 1% abused in other ways.)

Then, with her having been ""in the life,"" for the two of them not to have gotten the standard blood tests before they married and practiced safe sex after marriage -- gee, folks -- this wasn't high drama -- it was poor writing.

For Josh to ""pay the price"" to marry Violet, and to have to ""forgive"" her for being a prostitute when the emotion he was obviously really having the most trouble dealing with -- his jealousy of the other men in her life -- was never even addressed -- again, poor writing.

The only character who needed to forgive Violet was Violet. And the real drama in the movie got glossed over and hardly even dealt with -- Violet's own wrestling with her remorse at having infected him. There was the true drama of the movie -- Violet's growth from a cold, overcontrolled prostitute to a loving, self-forgiving woman. And it wasn't even touched on.

The high point of the movie was the last line, though. Someting like, ""The only thing you can take across the Bridge to the Other Side is Love, because it's the only thing that never fails.""

Don't forget....

God is love.",1222473600,,1901,4.505813953488372
8150353,1,B000JGW4N6,"This movie is a typical liberal feel good view that accentuates the goodness of man, and presents an unrealistic view of man.  No dealing with sin or Jesus Christ or the need of forgiveness (by God).  I wouldn't recommend this film.",1193184000,,232,4.634146341463414
8150354,2,B000JGW4N6,"I really gave this movie the benefit of the doubt. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't get past the music, it was AWFUL! Organ music throughout? YUK YUK YUK. The music alone made the movie more like a cheap dimestore novel romance than anything. The set was fine. The acting passable (except for the little kid who was obviously NOT an actor!). The dialog, stiff. The story... was actually good. So, in spite of the awful music, the slow moving plot, some of the bad acting and stiff dialog, I'm glad I watched it all the way to the end. I liked the message. I liked the characters of Josh and Violet. If only the music used were different! It would have improved the movie exponentially.",1188604800,,688,4.3828125
8150355,5,B000JGW4N6,"This movie is altogether original. Yet the plot has an obvious basis in the Gospels and 2nd Corinthians on ""Love"".  Josh is at first mezmerized by Violet's beauty, almost getting into trouble, from which we are sure he will be caught.  The question is asked, ""Why do we fall in love?""  It is a mystery that is not answered (although a subject of scientific study).  ""Why did you fall in love with her and not me?"" But, ultimately, why did Jesus Love His Bride, the Church, unto Death?  Why did Jesus feel so compelled, so passionate, as walk the Passion to the Cross to offer God's Love to Everyone?  The prostitute Lucy, whom Josh names his Violet, has simulaties to Mary Magdeline (?), the prostitute Jesus saved from stoning, but ultimate Jesus pays the price for her.  The final vision scenes of the lovers reunited in the afterlife, finally finish our weeping!  The movie was highly emotionally moving.  The salvation of Lucy brings her to flower as Violet, much as names are changed in the Old and New Testament to show the change God'd Love has had on the human person.  The movie is thought provoking about what it means for husbands to love their wives today, laying down their lives for their friends, is still the greatest act of love.  A moral of the movie plot shows that God loves the sick, even those with AIDS, unto death, and does not condemn, nor judge the sinner as the self-righteous may do.  God, the Creator, the Knower of the Beloved, brings only Everlasting Life in Love.",1182124800,,1495,4.578947368421052
8150356,1,B000JGW4N6,"this movie is terrible, the music, the story , the acting, the dialouge ,  you name it  its terrible. there are so many places in the movie where there are just like dead spaces, one scene shows the guy standing around waiting for like several minutes. the very beginning of the movie has absolutly no dialogue for at least the first 10 minutes or so. the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the women are pretty hot other than that nope.  and as far as them trying to relate this to some sort of christian thing. well , there is not one mention of any religion in the whole movie, if you didn't know the title , you probably would have no idea that this movie was supposed to have any religious point at all.  and as far as them trying to say it has some deeper meaning that a non-christian or young christian wouldnt get,  well they don't display any of that very well at all. basically its a story of some guy falling in love with a prostitute  and thats about it, its boring, its one of those movies you watch just to laugh at how absolutly bad it is. there is practically no plot at all. and were supposed to believe that a guy marrying a prostitute is somehow related to jesus dying for the world.  whatever you do don't waste your money, if you wanna see what i mean, rent this movie DO NOT BUY, use your blockbuster or netflix online rental account to get it, if you spend money on this , even if its 1 dollar, you will feel ripped off",1180137600,3,1458,4.148936170212766
