These were good episodes, and I especially liked the Mist Goblin ones. ^^; I'm a sucker for any Jimmy/Rachel (Shinichi/Ran) moments. The 3rd episode really got me thinking. This is a great series if you love to solve mysteries and like some romance. ;) It usually always keeps me thinking, and some of the ways the murder takes place are awfully bizarre. I especially like how they're translating the Japanese songs into English. It's interesting to hear, and I actually prefer the English songs sometimes over the Japanese. ^^' If you're a fan, go ahead and pick up this DVD, it's got some good episodes and new songs.",1104192000,2,808,4.65034965034965
8022834,5,B00026L8HG,"Despite the precense of only three episodes, Mist Goblin Murder Part 1&2, and Weapon of Choice, it's worth the price tag. Not only to support FUNimation but you also get to see the two new openings and one new closing sequence, and if you've seen the Japanese ones, you will be pleasantly surprised.

Support FUNimation and pick this up, the episodes are good too.",1094428800,,364,4.6875
8022835,1,B00026L8HG,"3 episodes x $20 = rip-off!

This is no reflection on the show (which is awesome), just the way FUNimation has decided to release it.  For more information on Vols. 1 & 2, check my review on the Starter Set page.",1093651200,2,212,4.146341463414634
8022836,5,B00026L8HG,"Okay, I've seen a lot of stores and websites advertising Deadly Illusions as Case Closed vol. 2.  It isn't.  It's actually volume 1 of the fourth series and starts at episode 53 ""The Mist Goblin Murder, part 1"".  For some reason, Funimation seems to be releasing seasons 1 and 4 simultaneously.  Yeah, wierd, huh?  Anyway, the series is about a 17-year-old genius detective named Jimmy Kudo.  Because of an experimental poison slipped to him by some mysterious men in black, he is shrunk into the size of a second grader.  To hide the fact that he lived from the bad guys, he poses as Conan Edogawa, only letting his neighbor, Dr. Agasa know the truth (and getting a lot of cool gadgets from the good doctor in the process).  There is supense in every episode (it is a mystery series, after all), humor (in the form of the bumbling detective Richard Moore, whom Conan/Jimmy uses to track down clues leading to the Men in Black), and some romance (in Jimmy's now frustrated crush on Richard's daughter, Rachael). I highly recommend the entire series to anyone who's a fan of animes like Lupin III, or a fan of mysteries like Sherlock Holmes.",1093392000,3,1140,4.63681592039801
8022837,5,B00026L8HG,"God, how I love this show. I started watching it during the summer and now I'm real sad that I'm probably not going to be able to see it anymore because of school. The cases are really complex. I am a little confused though, because cartoon network appears to be dubbing more episodes and they are playing reruns, but the case closed website says that new episodes are airing on cartoon network for the past couple of nights. Hmmm. Oh well. One last thing, does anyone know which episodes are on this volume?

Long live Conan!",1092787200,,526,4.479166666666667
8022838,5,B00026L8HG,"Case Closed has come to be one of my favorite Anime series, when I barely started seeing it I thought it was going to be stupid, but then I got into it and I haven't missed an episode since. Anyone who is an Anime fan should watch Case Closed once you start seeing it you won't stop watching it, you will just want to know who the killer in every episode is and it always turns out to be the person you least expect. so when this DVD comes out Im definetly gonna buy it, Im even going to buy the whole complete T.V. series because of how much it really kicks ass!",1092787200,,563,3.9911504424778763
