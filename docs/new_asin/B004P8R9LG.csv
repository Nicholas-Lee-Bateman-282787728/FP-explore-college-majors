4444013,5,B004P8R9LG,I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A COMPLETE COLLECTION OF TIM'S MOVIES FOR SOME TIME....WE NOW HAVE THEM...HIS MOVIES WERE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY IN ALL ASPECTS OF THESE TYPES OF WESTERNS LIKE HOPPY WESTERNS WHICH OF I HAVE BOTH T.V. AND THEATER ...THIS FIRST VOLUME IS OUT STANDING IN QUALITY ......THANKS,1306627200,,297,4.8431372549019605
4444014,5,B004P8R9LG,"Of all the B Westerns I've seen (and I've seen hundred, with Gene, Roy, Lash, Billy Carson, Hoppy, Durango...you name it, I've seen it), the Tim Holt B Westerns are teh best. When you don't have the early Tim Holt movies with Ray Whitley singing some very catchy tunes (and you can find nearly all of those Tunes on Youtube by searching for Ray Whitley), you have the later Tim Holt movies with his sidekick Chito Jose Gonzalas Bustamante Rafferty (Irish for fighting/Spanish for loving) providing the comedy relief. Tim was a genuine cowboy and hero to the young'ns and just happened to be in the RKO films that had great scenery, stories, and dialogue.

You don't get my favorite movie in this set (Tim's first starring role, Wagon Train). But you get a lot of other terrific ones from young Tim's Pre-WWII years. Here are the movies you get in this fantastic set of 10 Tim Holt movies:
ALONG THE RIO GRANDE 1941 - In order to avenge their boss, three cowhands pose as bank robbers. With Ray Whitley. This movie also stars Betty Jane Rhodes as the cantina singer and Tim's love interest. Terrific excitement, comedy, and music makes this my second favorite Holt movie behind Wagon Train.

BANDIT TRAIL 1941 - A bank robber poses as a Town Marshal, only to find the law growing on him. With Roy Barcroft. Ray sings ""On the Outlaw Trail"" in this movie where Tim has to decide about taking the law into his own hands.

ROBBERS OF THE RANGE 1941 - Framed for murder, a rancher assumes a dead man's identity in his quest for justice. With Virginia Vale.

DUDE COWBOY 1941 - A federal agent investigates a counterfeiting ring at a dude ranch. With Marjorie Reynolds. Lots of great songs in this one and some tempered heat between Tim and Marjorie Reynolds.

COME ON DANGER 1942 - Holt takes the lead in this new take on the Renegade Ranger tale. With Ray Whitley. Terrific movie with a good gun battle at the end, and comedy throughout. More fun songs from Ray.

BANDIT RANGER 1942 - A young rancher is framed for the murder of a ranger. With Cliff Edwards. Ike is terrific in this one as Tim's sidekick.

PIRATES OF THE PRAIRIE 1942 - A Deputy U.S. Marshall investigates two towns ruled by vigilantes. With Nell O'Day. Another movie with Ike Edwards as his sidekick and comedy relief

FIGHTING FRONTIER 1943 - Special Investigator Kit Russell discovers that a gang of robbers has a secret master. With Ann Summers.

So of the 10 movies here, three have Cliff Edwards as Tim's sidekick. The other 7 are split up between Emmett Lynn and Lasses White. Emmett happens to be my favorite, but I'm probably in the minority on that.

Enjoy this series where the picture is good and the movies are great!",1306454400,33,2692,4.566390041493776
4444015,4,B004P8R9LG,"If you are a fan of the B Western then this selection is for you!! Good
story lines,good action & likeable cowboy stars like Tim Holt & George
O'Brien. Warner Archive is commended for releasing this 5 dvd set of 10
titles. Picture & sound quality is excellent. The weakest film in the bunch
is LAW WEST OF TOMBSTONE,this is a personal view. Hopefully we will get similar releases from the Warner Archive!!",1305590400,,405,4.561643835616438
4444016,3,B004P8R9LG,"People who enjoy 1949 black and white westerns where guns are fired, but no puncture or blood are seen, where an hour film is filled with humor and love, where characters make fun of each other as we did when we were children, where the plot is so simple you can leave the room for five minutes twice during the hour without missing anything important, will enjoy this Tim Holt movie. A very rich somewhat silly father snatches his somewhat silly daughter from her lover in San Francisco and takes her by coach to his huge ranch in Arizona. She pouts and is reluctant to go.
 While the rich man was away from his ranch, his foreman and the foreman's two cohorts robbed the ranch and sold off most of his cattle. They hear that he is returning and decide to kill him before he arrives so that he would not find out about the robbery. The two cohorts ride after the coach in typical western style, guns blazing but hitting nothing, but they are stopped when Tim Holt rides up with his pal and shoots at them, without hitting them (although they are expert shooters who never miss - for to hit them would end the film). Tim and his pal drive the coach, which they own - hence the film's name ""Stagecoach Kid"" - to a rest stop where the reluctant moping daughter runs off and disguises herself as a boy - even though we viewers can see that she has ample breasts. She reenters the stage coach as it is about to leave, while her father stays behind looking for her. She wants to ride to the train station and catch a train back to San Francisco.

 When the foreman finds out that his cohorts failed to kill the ranch owner, he sends them back for a second try. They stop the coach, but do not find the rancher, who did not reboard it. The girl sees the face of one of the gunmen when his mask slips off.

 Viewers can see what happens next. I dare not ruin their day by revealing the end. Will the foremen and his men kill the rancher? Will the three begin to fight among themselves as usually occurs in these films? What will happen to them? Will the girl forget her San Francisco fling? Will she fall for Tim Holt? Will he fall for her? Did he know that she was a woman even when she was in disguise?",1300752000,5,2197,4.233890214797136

4444019,4,B004P8R9LG,"The DVDs are of excellent quality both in picture and sound. Of the first two films, one is a George O'Brien vehicle (no bad thing) with Tim as second lead and the second is a Harry Carey film with Tim in a similar position. The problem with this second film is that it is supposed to be a comedy western but, in truth, it is not very funny. Otherwise I would have given this product 5 stars. As for the remaining films they are well worth watching. Good plots, budgets, locations, directors and host of well known villains. The songs from Ray Whitley/Cliff Edwards are OK and not too intrusive. I agree with another correspondent who expressed disappointment that Tim's first solo film ""Wagon Train"" was not included but I believe that this film will be included in Volume 4. One thing puzzles me. As Tim was a first class horseman why did RKO or the directors not include any running inserts?",1396310400,,894,4.5246913580246915
4444020,4,B004P8R9LG,"Tim Holt was one of the cowboys I enjoyed when I was a kid and when I found these on Amazon I just had to get them.

4444021,4,B004P8R9LG,"By the time you are half way through this excellent collection you will be rooting for Tim and his friends. These include George O'Brien and Rita Hayworth in The Renegade Ranger and Harry Carey, Sr.  in the absolutely fascinating take on the old west and its legends, The Law West of Tombstone -- a quirky re-telling of the Judge Roy Bean Story.  Tim's sidekick's are played beautifully by Emmett Lynn in the early films and Cliff Edwards later on. Musical interludes by Ray Whitely most of the time. You cannot go wrong. An aside: Tim Holt was from a film family. His father Jack was starring in the teens and in character parts during the sound era. Sister Jennifer, a great beauty played leads in cowboy pictures of the forties and Tim, in addition to starring for RKO in their western series, played top parts in The Magnificent Ambersons. Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and likeable support in Gold Is Where You Find It, Stagecoach and Fifth Avenue Girl, among many others.",1389398400,,977,4.674418604651163

4444024,4,B004P8R9LG,"You have to be of an age to remember & enjoy B westerns. Many younger western fans like A westerns, but are unaware of B westerns. Here is an opportunity to savour B westerns with Tim Holt, young, versatile, active, fun and liked by the ladies! Also he had a sidekick, very rare in A westerns. His horse was a pal unlike A western stars who rarely did anything other than ride across the screen and tie up their "" transport "" before entering the saloon for a beer or a whiskey....B westerns are somewhat rare and not to be confused with the many TV westerns  - excellent viewing  -
available on Amazon. Tim Holt was a cowboy star in the B western and sadly died young, though his
father and sister kept the Holt name alive.

I hope you will be as happy with the purchase of this DVD as my father and I are!  :)",1325548800,,420,3.9058823529411764
4444031,5,B004P8R9LG,I so enjoyed watching all the Tim Holt movies; it took me back to when I was young when we sat around on an afternoon watching westerns on TV. I had forgotten how cool they were.  Now days everyone is into being policial correct when back in the 1800's and early 1900's they weren't concerned about it.,1324684800,,302,4.298245614035087
4444032,5,B004P8R9LG,"As a fan of cowboy Westerns, I found that Tim Holt movies were often a bit more adult than the standard juvenile fare. Surely Westerns were made for the kiddies in the 1940s, who flocked to movie palaces to watch Hopalong Cassidy and Roy Rogers. But Tim Holt Westerns were made for adults as well as children. Turner Classic Movies has aired a number of them in the past and even with Turner in High Def, the quality was so-so because the studio kept turning to the same masters year after year.

Thankfully, this five-disc set has the same movies but transferred using today's latest technology and equipment, and are obviously from the 35mm nitrates, so the picture quality is better than what you see on Turner! Warner Archive came out with three sets and all of them are just as gorgeous as this volume.

By the way, Warner Brothers has been releasing these DVDs in DVD-R format. Regrettably, a friend of mine who bought a set and watched it wanted to resell it. After all, he didn't want to keep it, just watch the films and then put the DVD set back up on Amazon as ""used"" and at a discount. Someone bought the set and filed a complaint, stating they were bootlegs because they were DVD-R format. Amazon.com acknowledges and discloses the fact that these are DVD-R format, but when the customer complained, Amazon kicked my friend off their site and he cannot buy anything from Amazon.com any more. This is a shame and unfair to my friend because it's the very same item Amazon shipped to him. Small suggestion: If you decide to resell your Tim Holt set, consider reselling it elsewhere.",1322006400,17,1593,4.585964912280701
