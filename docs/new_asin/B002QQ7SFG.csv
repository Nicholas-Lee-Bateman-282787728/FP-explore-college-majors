8377884,5,B002QQ7SFG,"This is an extremely educational program about bridges, their construction and why they sometimes collapse. The program outlines one of the very first recorded bridge collaspes of 1879. The Tay Bridge disaster occurred during a violent storm on December 28, 1879 when the first Tay Rail Bridge collapsed while a train was passing over it from Wormit to Dundee,killing all aboard. The bridge - designed by Sir Thomas Bouch - used lattice girders supported by iron piers, with cast iron columns and wrought iron cross-bracing. The piers were narrower and their cross-bracing was less extensive and robust than on previous similar designs by Bouch.

Bouch had sought expert advice on ""wind loading"" when designing a proposed rail bridge over the Firth of Forth; as a result of that advice he had made no explicit allowance for wind loading in the design of the Tay Bridge. There were other flaws in detailed design, in maintenance, and in quality control of castings, all of which were, at least in part, Bouch's responsibility.

Bouch died within the year, with his reputation as an engineer ruined. Future British bridge designs had to allow for wind loadings of up to 56 pounds per square foot. Consequently,Bouch's design for the Forth Rail Bridge was never used.

Amazing archival film footage of the Tay Bridge collapse, as well as other bridge collapses. This program also explores the tallest bridge in the world piercing the sky above the verdant hills of southern France.

Celebrated as a work of art and an object of French national pride, the Millau bridge will enable motorists to take a drive through the sky -- 891 feet above the Tarn River valley for a 1.6-mile stretch through France's Massif Central mountains.

Designed by British architect Norman Foster, the steel-and-concrete bridge with its streamlined diagonal suspension cables rests on seven pillars -- the tallest measuring 1,122 feet, making it 53 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower.

The bridge, which has an airy and fluid appearance, was designed to have the ""delicacy of a butterfly"", and is an amazing sight to see.

You will thoroughly enjoy this program about bridges, and the potential problems facing their construction and sometimes their collapse. Loaded with insightful information and fantastic archival film footage. A really must see!!!!",1377993600,,2326,5.121372031662269
