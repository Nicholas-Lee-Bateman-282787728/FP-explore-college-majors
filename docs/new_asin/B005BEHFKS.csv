4643760,5,B005BEHFKS,I got this for my niece and nephew and it's amazing! they love it! They keep asking for more Shalom Sesame all the time.,1359763200,2,120,4.041666666666667
4643761,5,B005BEHFKS,Everyone really enjoys the series. It will be view many more times over the years and then will be dontaed.,1356998400,4,107,4.4
4643762,5,B005BEHFKS,"I bought this series to supplement my child's religious studies and I was not disappointed.  My boys are 7 and 8, and although the series is a little bit too babyish for this age, they are still willing to watch and are learning from it.  I would absolutley recommend these DVD's for preschool through first grade.  Super cute and adults can watch them with children and be entertained too.",1355443200,3,390,4.6231884057971016
4643763,2,B005BEHFKS,"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday, and I am deeply disappointed with it.  Each episode is only 30 minutes rather than an hour, and there is barely 5 minutes of muppets.  The rest is just cartoon shorts of the alefbet and old stock footage, including scenes from some random bar mitzvah.  Not worth the price.  Get your muppet fix from PBS, and rely on yourself and your community to teach your child Jewish values.",1354147200,3,427,4.578947368421052
4643764,5,B005BEHFKS,"All 7 of my children love this series! The DVD's are entertaining, educational, and exactly what you would expect from Sesame Street productions. None of them are duplicates of each other, which as a mom who has to watch them over and over again I can appreciate.",1353888000,3,263,4.617021276595745
4643765,5,B005BEHFKS,"This is a fabulous set of DVDs.  Please see the list of the items that I have reviewed to see my review of each individual video.  I only wish that I could have purchased the videos as a set, but I purchased them individually as they were released.  Each video teaches kids about Israel, Judaism, Jewish holidays, treating people with respect, diversity, and respect for others.  The set can be enjoyed by both Jewish and non-Jewish children alike.  Each video is complementary and not at all duplicative.  Therefore, it makes sense to buy the whole set because after watching one, you will wish that you can see them all.  Let me know if you have specific questions.  I have seen each DVD at least 20 times and learn and enjoy something knew each time I watch them.",1322438400,30,766,4.54014598540146

4643782,5,B005BEHFKS,"Easy to understand with the wonderful story telling that you have come to expect from Sesame Street characters.

8463977,5,B005BEHFKS,An updated version of the Classic Shalom Seasame. Our kids love this version equally with the first. I enjoy the multiple lessons in English and Hebrew. Hard to say no to TV when our kids ask to watch it.,1475193600,,204,4.256410256410256
8463978,5,B005BEHFKS,"This pack includes 12 programs on 6 DVDs, and they are each packed in a thin plastic case. The box I received was dinged up on the corners, but the plastic cases kept the DVDs in perfect shape. The programs cover the major holidays as well as Shabbat, and an introduction to Hebrew and Israel. These are Sesame Street programs, so they feature some well-known muppets like The Count (counting in Hebrew!) and Grover. They also have Moishe Oofnik instead of Oscar the Grouch. Each program has an overarching plot filled in with songs, cutaways to real kids talking about life and holidays in Israel, celebrities leading a short educational or musical section, and animated bits teaching Hebrew letters and words. Each program has a chapter guide if you only want to use one section; the whole program is usually about 30 minutes. They also have a couple ""extras"" with each program like mini-movies or sing-alongs.
The DVD's have great quality audio and video, except for the extra 80's DVD which is reprinting an old copy. The celebrity guests are from 2010, so that's far more updated than the old 80's videos featuring One Day at a Time's Bonnie Franklin. The 80's DVD with 2 programs- Jerusalem and The People of Israel- are the only ones with teachers' guides, which is disappointing. However, shalomsesame.org has some fun extensions and lyrics sheets for the sing-alongs featured in the new programs. We use these videos with the kids' magazines for our Pre-K curriculum, but the videos can stand on their own very well.  The one annoyance is having to sit through a full 5 minutes of the government copywrite warning screens and Sesame Street ads that you cannot skip whenever you put a DVD in the player. (You can at least fast forward the ad section on a computer video player if you're using a laptop to screen the movies.) If you press play and get to the main screen while the kids are getting situated, it's not a problem.",1474243200,,1934,4.72189349112426
