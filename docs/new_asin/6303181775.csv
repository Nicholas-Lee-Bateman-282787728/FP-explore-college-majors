I have yet to find a workout VHS or DVD that compares, and I own or have owned many!!  The Firm, Zumba, P90X, etc. and I still keep going back to this tape.  Well....until recently, a friend of mine just burned it to DVD for me!  If you want a great 20 minute awesome areobic workout and great ab and butt workout this is the video for you. Maybe you can get a friend to burn it to DVD for you too!",1281657600,2,517,3.9805825242718447
