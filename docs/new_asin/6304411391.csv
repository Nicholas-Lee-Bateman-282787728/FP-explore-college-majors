877710,4,6304411391,"'Buffalo Bill' is a satirical broadside aimed at a nation arrogant enough to think it can write its own history.  Throughout, living legends with their sanitised, mendacious or egocentric versions of history, are assured that their names will resound through the ages, when, less than a century later, an angry film-maker is exposing these people and their history as so much noisy, gaudy spectacle drowning out truth and murder.
Made in America's murkiest decade, the film looks at a country repeatedly deluding itself and unable to handle it when this delusion is exposed.  It does for the Western and American history what 'Oh What a lovely war' did for English history, turning it into a circus, where sacred 'truths' are revealed to be at best distorted stories, and at worse criminal fabrications.  it equates that history with showbusiness (this is an arena in which historical players become showbiz stars; the funniest sequence involves a special 'Wild West' show for President Cleveland, with taciturn Sitting Bull feigning an assassination), with politics.
'Bill' isn't as subtle or affecting as Altman's great Western, 'McCabe and Mrs Miller' - the playing with reality and appearance, between the flawed protagonist and his majestic image, is sometimes heavy-handed, though as often poignant (Paul Newman is brilliant, revealing both Cody's voracious ego and its related insecurity).  As with the earlier masterpiece, Altman is not content to merely demolish myth - he creates a rich, fraught realism which simply by existing quashes the myth - the cacophany of conflicting voices, dialects and sounds (where the smallest supporting bit player is ennnobled by the vignette-structured comedy); the comic obsession with period detail, including some wonderfully ridiculous hair; the faithfulness to the era's mindset, its modes of cultural (especially visual) expression, while retaining a critical late-20th century perspective, allowing the film to be at once mercilessly cynical and yet somehow affectionate to its monstrous protagonists and their faith in the showbiz which, after all, is royally entertaining us.
Typically, this 'realism' is one more level Altman undermines - the whole story is an alcoholic loser's biased anecdote, while Sitting Bull's dream power more than once engulfs Bill's identity and his narrative.  A flawed, but very funny film.",1002585600,4,2372,5.452316076294278
877711,4,6304411391,"""Buffalo Bill and the Indians"" was a riveting movie. Bored? Hardly. Joel Gray came close to stealing this picture, as he has many times, as Bill's business partner. While the historical Cody wasn't anywhere near the charlatan Paul Newman and Altman have made him, his portrayal reminds us all not to believe our own press.
Cody and many of the other men of that era -- James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok springs to mind -- had lived eventful lives, lives that fascinated Easterners, reading the Dime Novels and Penny Dreadfuls or seeing one of the Wild West Shows or plays about the west. Cody and Hickok were prone to give the people what they wanted, playing their characters pretty near to the hilt. They had a sense that their time was passing and the things which had made them famous, the exploits that had made their lives seem adventutous, were coming to an end. You get this sense of approaching, inevitable obsolescence in Newman's portrayal, especially as the film nears it's end.
I have waited for this film to be available in a decent version and I wasn't dsiappointed.
See the film. Make your own decisions. There are several fine performances and Newman and Altman don't quite let Joel Gray steal the picture. They allow fine performances from many actors, especially Geraldine Chaplin as Annie Oakley, to shine through.

877712,4,6304411391,"Robert Altman's ""Buffalo Bill and the Indians (or Sitting Bull's History Lession)"" has largely been forgotten while his other films from this period have been rediscovered as classics.  While maybe its time  for this one too.
The ""Why"" of why this film such a critical  bomb is not hard to decipher, Altman is continuing his critique of the West  that started with ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"".  Yet this film is  even more scathing.  Bufflo Bill is an illiterate buffoon and President  Cleveland works as a reminder that there were politicians back then.  What  I think really worked against Altman here, wasn't his treatment of this  historical period but the changing of his own.  In 1976, audiences were  getting tired of these self-conscious films that were popular just five  years eariler.  ""Buffalo Bill"" stuck between ""Jaws"" (in  '75) and then  ""Star Wars"" (in '77) was a hard sell as the  country was getting more conservative.
Beside this, ""Buffalo  Bill"" like a lot Altman films is a great film.  He continues his  pioneering use of overlapping dialogue and widescreen cinematography.  And  oh, did I mention it was funny, a second viewing really helps catch all of  Altman's wry wit.  Newman fooling around with ballet dancers is hilarious.  And you can't tell me that the extra ""Or Sitting Bull's History  Lession"" isn't a homage to Kubrick.",961977600,17,1351,4.941704035874439
877713,4,6304411391,"While not approaching the level of ""Nashville"" or ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller,"" this film employs all of the Altman tricks (overlapping dialogue, a cast of thousands) to bring forth a scathing  attack on America's reliance on myth and the need to rewrite the past with  lies and hypocrisy. At every turn, Altman gives us images of a culture so  immersed in show business and deception that it is no longer able to  distinguish between reality and fantasy. While that in itself is hardly an  original concept (especially for Altman, one of our greatest satirists), it  works here because the film was released in 1976, the very year America was  congratulating itself for a job well done. The best image remains the last,  a reinforcement of America's need to dominate and win at all cost, even  though such victories might be tainted by cheap shots and blatant  unfairness.",961545600,15,867,4.836734693877551

877843,1,6304411391,"This was on tv last night.  I like Paul Newman.  I like Wild Bill.  I was going to purchase this movie before I watched it.  Don't.  It is awful.  Awful as in ""all this talent and this is the best they could do?""  The ending is especially awful, it is an alcoholic induced hallucination that does nothing to tell me anything about anyone in this movie.

The writing is horrid.  The acting is so wooden that I thought that they were making a snide aside about ""wooden Indians.""  This movie is, if you can believe it, worse than ""The Silver Chalice.""  And Newman hated that movie.

I expected so much from this movie.  I expected to see some of the insights I have gotten from books about Wild Bill and Sitting Bull.  But nothing.  And, even though I love opera, I found two of the ""artistes"" whom Cody romances to be screechers, rather than singers.  The last one, though, is quite good.

Top notch actors aka stars, great horsemanship, but no depth, no insights, nothing but a ""day in the life"" type that dragged and dragged and dragged.  I kept hoping that there would be a ""eureka moment"" but no, just a ""ohforgawd'ssake"" on and on and on.  Annie Oakley is especially wasted, Ned Buntline is never explained other than as a ""I made him what he is today"" character.

In June 1942 the British Eighth Army was being pushed back to Cairo by German forces under Rommel. One tank goes on by itself. J. J. Bramble escapes and walks on, the sole survivor. The German forces move into town. An officer takes charge and questions the people in the hotel, they will use it as headquarters. That British soldier puts on civilian clothes to play the waiter. Paul Davos is a German spy! Mouche talks to Bramble. [Talk pads out the story.] British prisoners are marched through the streets. Mouche talks to Rommel. The Lieutenant talks to Mouche. British officers arrive, one looks at Davos. They want information from Rommel. There is a body in the cellar, can it be kept hidden?

Can Davos discover where the Germans hid water, fuel, and ammunition? Yes, it was hidden in plain sight. Davos traces a copy onto a handkerchief! An air raid sends everyone to the cellar. The Lieutenant finds something in the cellar! There is personal conflict. They found the Lieutenant in Mouches room! Then Davos leaves for Cairo. Can Mouche be saved? Yes, with new evidence tomorrow. The German Army was stopped at El Alamein, then forced back. The Americans invaded North Africa at the back of the German Army, the Germans are defeated. Bramble learns what happened.

This is one of the movies that tells about the culture of war-time America. It is less dramatic than other movies from that era, perhaps because of its origin as a stage play.

878042,5,6304411391,"Buffalo Bill and the Indians (Robert Altman, 1976, 123')

Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson is a 1976 revisionist Western directed by Robert Altman and based on the play Indians by Arthur Kopit. It stars Paul Newman as William F Cody, alias Buffalo Bill, along with Geraldine Chaplin, Will Sampson, Joel Grey, Harvey Keitel and Burt Lancaster as Bill's biographer, Ned Buntline. The film was poorly received at the time of its release, when the country was celebrating its bicentennial. As in MASH, Altman skewers an American historical myth of heroism, in this case the notion that noble white men fighting bloodthirsty savages won the West. Most of the film was shot on location in Alberta, Canada. In 1976 the film was entered into the 26th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Golden Bear.

Like many of Altman's films, Buffalo Bill and the Indians is an ensemble piece with an episodic structure. It follows the day to day performances and behind-the-scenes intrigues of Buffalo Bill Cody's famous ""Wild West Show,"" a hugely popular 1880s entertainment spectacular that starred the former Indian fighter, scout and buffalo hunter. Altman uses the setting to criticize Old West motifs, presenting the eponymous western hero as a show-biz creation who can no longer separate his invented image from reality.

Altman's Cody is a loud-mouthed buffoon, a man who claims to be one with the Wild West but lives in luxury, play-acting daily in a western circus of his own making. Cody's long hair is a wig, he can't shoot straight anymore or track an Indian, and all his staged battles with ruffians and savages are rigged in his favor. However, this does not keep him from acting as if his triumphs are real, or plaguing his patient entourage of yes-men with endless monologues about himself.

The story begins in 1885 with the arrival of an important new guest star in Buffalo Bill Cody's grand illusion, Chief Sitting Bull of Little Big Horn fame. Much to Cody's annoyance, Sitting Bull proves to be not a murdering savage but a genuine embodiment of what the whites believe about their own history out west. He is quietly heroic and morally pure. Sitting Bull also refuses to portray Custer's Last Stand as a cowardly sneak attack. Instead, he asks Cody to act out the massacre of a peaceful Sioux village by marauding bluecoats. An enraged Cody fires him but is forced to relent when star attraction Annie Oakley takes Sitting Bull's side. (All compiled and edited from Wikipedia)

But in that sense, it is a Dime Novel on film, and is in the tradition of the 19th Century dime novelists who took a good deal of liberty with the truth as relates to actual persons and events.  They never let the truth get in the way of a good story.

The film is filled with insights into the general state of mind of the people of the late 19th Century, which is good, but unfortunately the film is a bit laborious to watch for two reasons.  First, it is a series of vignettes strung out one after the other, which causes the film to lose focus.  Each scene is a stand-alone piece, and the individual scenes don't merge into a truly coherent story line.  Second, all of the action takes place in one locale, which is visually monotonous.  The sad thing is that these negative traits cause the audience to lose interest in the story.  All they want to know is ""when will all of this end?""

With a radiant Paul Newman,  supported by Burt Lancaster's bemused Ned Buntline of the dime novel, we have a script delivering a steady drumroll of putdowns about the creation of the West. Buntline exits stage door left, deeply uncertain about the transformation of his own commodity into a newer, more spectacular, but thinner variant. Whatever resonance the film may be attempting to strike with 1880s values, Altman's film has plenty to say about 1970s liberal values. The buffoonery proceeds apace while Bill connives to con Sitting Bull to headline his Wild West Show. The Sioux lads (Sitting Bull has an interpreter, the aptly dubbed and granite-like, William Sampson)don't budge a grain of gravel in contracting to participate. They comply merely to facilitate the course of Sitting Bull's dream. The camera frequently withdraws to encompass the immensity of the eternal mountain range behind the ephemerality of the carnival. Bill is foiled. His grog-addled arrogance and vanity are no match for the sombre indigenies who stake their land claim,to no avail, before an supremely ignorant President Cleveland. The whites are the dills in Altman's bigger picture which has Bull's demise promptly trivialised when re-enacted in the pitiful stage death by his stoic interpreter.

Robert Altman is famous for movings that expose how easily people fall for myths and stories, and this is no exception. Bill and his crew are all larger than life, believing in the stories written about themselves. They decide to put Geronimo into their act, thinking that they can stir up their audience into a blood lust against the ""evil Indians"".

To their surprise, people actually respect the native Americans, and even the president comes out to meet Geronimo for himself. In the end it's only Geronimo that speaks honestly, and he is ignored. He leaves the white men to their problems.

There are a number of famous actors and actresses here - Joel Grey, Harvey Keitel, Burt Lancaster, Geraldine Chaplin. Undoubtedly all signed on to make a movie that had social significance, especially with it coming out in 1976 - America's 200th year of independence. However, they are in essence satiring people who in fact were ""heroes"" in many ways. Buffalo Bill did in fact do some impressive things in his life. By all accounts Geronimo liked him and enjoyed being with him. For many of the city slickers, these shows were their only glimpse into what the wild west was all about, even in a general portrayal.

Also, the native americans are treated as being supernatural Gods. They get across rivers that are uncrossable, they set up lodgings where they should not be able to. There isn't any relating to them as people, as a culture. I would really have liked to see more of the cross-cultural issues - the different ways in which they related to women, to minorities, to performing in public.",1164844800,3,1695,4.758503401360544

In Paul Newman's Buffalo Bill Cody, legend of the wild west, and extraordinary showman, Altman gives the American man of myth, then chips away at him, all while the rival and counterpart Sitting Bull grows and deepens in merely standing still. Newman's performance is terrific, his eyes never betraying the truth of his limitations, though his histriotics along with those of his minions in his large show, work very well at entertaining and maintaining. Joel Grey, Kevin McCarthy and Harvey Keitel all stand out as Newman's producing partner, press agent and flunky respectively. Their sycophancy echoes the Emperors New Clothes, and is set against Sitting Bull and his right hand man Halsey, who agree to join the wild west history show in order to tell the truth of the matter, ever stoic and unimpressed by the show.

With humor and his trademark layering of sound, dialogue and wit Altman gives us the lesson of what is real and unreal, fraudulent and true, the stuff of history books and shows, and the heart of the matters.",1151712000,15,1349,5.044843049327354

But time has been very kind to this Altman sleeper.  I found Newman's performance exhilarating and comic, and Joel Grey hilarious and knowing.  Like many of Altman's films, this one is about the mythmaking of contemporary pop history, and the ""necessary illusions"" required by the audience to buy into and celebrate these myths.  Although the particular target here is western pop history, Altman's aims are much broader: the legacy of Native America abuse, the need of the audience to create and celebrate ""hero myths,"" and the schematic critique of star-worshipping history, written by the ""winners.""  Frank Kaquitts plays the critical role of truth-teller, and is understated and very funny as Sitting Bull, who joins Buffalo Bill's troupe with his interpreter, attempting to add some reality to Cody's wildly distorted (and wildly popular) western shows.

While the script of Altman and Alan Rudolph has some typical Altman flaws, fat, and excess, the benefit of time and careful reflection has served this little gem well.",1139270400,24,1494,5.2217573221757325
878155,2,6304411391,"So... it's the bicentennial year, you're Robert Altman and you want to make a movie about the building of a show business legend.  Hey, I watched the four-minute 1976 Making Of featurette on this disk and that's what Paul Newman seemed to think they were doing in BUFFALO BILL AND THE INDIANS.  What the heck - his guess is as good as any, and I haven't got a better way of explaining what exactly is going on here.

 We meet Buffalo Bill Cody when one of his flunkies is filling the schooner of whiskey he consumes during the day - he's cut his consumption to one drink a day, you see, so he pours a fifth of booze into a big glass and gnaws on it for the duration.  Get it?  Funny, funny stuff that.  Probably accurate, too, as such things are reckoned.  Not so sure about the string of pretty opera singers he goes through.  And the history books must have got wrong the universally reported friendship between Cody and Sitting Bull.  Here Cody doesn't even bother to hide his disdain for the chief.  You see, Sitting Bull had a dream he'd meet President Grover Cleveland (Pat McCormick) who'll turn his sizable back on him the first and only chance he gets.  Sitting Bull doesn't tell us of his dreams, of course.  He speaks through his imposing translator William Halsey (Will Sampson.) Halsy has the best line in the movie, and the most accurate critique of Altman's treatment of his subject.  ""Sitting Bull,"" Halsey says at one point,  ""says that history is nothing more than disrespect for the dead.""

  Well, Burt Lancaster is entertaining as legend maker Ned Buntline, who for some unexplained reason spends the movie in a nearby saloon, shunned by Cody until late in the last act. Maybe being segregated from the big movie saved him. Besides Lancaster there ain't much here to like.  For the most part BUFFALO BILL is slow, aimless, plotless, and not much fun.",1133395200,6,1871,4.581325301204819
878156,5,6304411391,"I too first saw this film in a theatre in 1976 after its release; I was with a few other people and to this day none of them probably care for this movie.

I read a lot on the west and have several books about Buffalo Bill Cody, so I wanted to see what Mr. Altman had done with this movie. I can not argue with anyone who doesn't care for this picture, would not try to couch my review so that they would.

Though I realize that the film doesn't give a total picture of what was going on at this time in the still unsettled west it does have a quality of those times to it. Buffalo Bill here is not the young, agile Army Indian Scout of old, nor the brazen hero awarded the Medal of Honor, he has been tempered both by age and the bottle; but let no one doubt that he in fact had done many things that were historical.  He was notable and respected in his time, and more over he was a capable western man and scout.  Later he was bankrupt not only in money but also in spirit; and his final show days with the 101 Wild West show are pitiful to this day.

One needs to remember, too, that shortly after Sitting Bull left Wild Bill's show, he was savagely murdered by his own Indian Police tribesmen at Pine Ridge Reservation.  Though the movie doesn't bring this out, and that was not never its intent, the 'west' was yet an unsettled area in some places, with several places being very dangerous. There are some western writers who claim the Apache were still making raids out of the Sierre Madre into the 1930s.

But men like Buffalo Bill and Frederick Remington who realized not only that the western times were changing, saw their 'west' disappearing, being replaced by something alien, with which they were totally unfamiliar. Each man attempted in his own way to keep ""their"" west alive in order that later people could visually see and understand it as they had experienced it. Today both men have come in for more than their share of disrespect.  In the several college history of art courses I took, not a single painting of our American west was ever to be found in either text book or on mid-term exam.

Some of the flux existing in these times has been captured brillantly on film by Mr Altman, whether that was his intent or not. Even Burt Lancaster's character, Ned Buntline, is at odds & ends and seems to be very much adrift in that new west that is replacing the old west. Even his blue G.A.R. uniform of Civil War days harkens back to a more familiar time, and as he rides off for the final time he doesn't have a clue where he is going.

I treasure this movie and watch it not only for its surrealism, symbolism, and realism, but because it does attempt to show the physical being and personalities of the Wild West Show itself. I'm old enough to have heard and read of what this show looked like, but thanks to Altman's sets I can more plainly realize it, and realize it in blazing color.

I think and have always thought that this is a very worthwhile movie.

878157,2,6304411391,"The one thing about the great directors is that even their misfires are interesting which is the case with ""Buffalo Bill and the Indians"".  Director Robert Altman wants to make the case that the mythology of the wild west is a sham and it's greatest legend, ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody, is an egomaniacal showboat.  Altman makes his case from the start and reiterates this theme throughout the film incoherently.  On paper it is brilliant casting of cinema's biggest star, Paul Newman, as Cody to play the west's biggest star.  But Newman, for the first time in a major motion picture, seems confused as to how to play this character.  Newman isn't the only one to flounder in this muddle.  Included in the cast are Burt Lancaster, Harvey Keitel, Geraldine Chaplin, Joel Grey and few of them are given any grist to sink their teeth into.  The film is a series of scenes that do not cohere.  Even the penultimate scene where Cody confronts the ghost of Sitting Bull is incoherent.  I debated whether to give this film two or three stars.  It's not exactly boring, but it is a mess.",1103846400,7,1072,4.624338624338624

Its beautiful to look at, funny (as only Robert Altman can be) and Altman gets great performances from his huge cast (Paul Newman, Joel Grey, Kevin McCarthy, and a nearly silent Shelly Duvall are wonderful). Don't expect history or any deep revelations. It gives you plenty to think about, and  plenty of laughs along the way.",1103500800,9,415,4.608108108108108
878159,3,6304411391,"If you had never heard of Buffalo Bill or read e e cummings' poem, I think it is doubtful you would appreciate the satire of this Robert Altman film.  As a teenager, I read a youth-oriented biography of Buffalo Bill, and from that gathered he was a ""real"" hero who killed and skinned lots of buffalo. Also around that time (1950s?) the musical `Annie Get Your Gun' with Ethyl Merman first wowed Broadway crowds and Doris Day made an Annie Oakley film (the title escapes me) that led folks to think kindly of Bill who gave her a job in his show.  Bill was viewed as a sort-of early PT Barnum. Given my changing attitudes as I matured and came to understand the sick mentality and wanton ways of early Western Americans who killed wholesale, I have perhaps a better appreciation of Altman's effort. Even so, I don't find this film particularly entertaining (i.e. I won't waste time watching it again).

  In those insensitive days of yore, ""the only good Indian was a dead Indian"" or so the cowboys in Western films often said.  By 1976, when Altman first released BUFFALO BILL AND THE INDIANS, OR SITTING BULL'S HISTORY LESSON, many people's consciousness had been raised, but I seem to recall the film was not an overwhelming success, because many of us still did not quite understand the atrocities that had been committted. As a result, many of us really noticed Altman only a few years later when he made the film MASH.

 This film BUFFALO BILL makes me feel sad because I was once so ignorant as to believe mistreatment of Indians was ""the American Way.""  After all, I was a fan of ""Death Valley Days"" hosted on tv by the actor Ronald Reagan, who pointed out week after week ""how the west was won."" It would be years before someone made a satirical film of the same name.

 This is not Paul Newman's best film.  I guess by the 1970s he wanted to be seen as a serious actor, so he went out of his way to make films which did not feature him as male cheesecake.  Newman has proved time and again he can do drama and comedy, but he's a lot funnier in ""Rally Round the Flag"" a leftest spoof of the Pentagon Brass.

 The DVD is technically fine, and certainly if you are interested in Altman's progress as a director this is a good place to begin.  Joel Grey, Geraldine Chapman and Burt Lancaster are featured in the film. The fellows who played the Indians were not provided credits on the DVD cover, though I think I saw their names briefly in the film credits.",1097884800,2,2462,4.437777777777778
878160,4,6304411391,"This is a quirky take on white/native relations in the late 19th/early 20th century, a mad mix of historical fact and whimsical fiction.  Newman is masterful as the addled demagogue into which Buffalo Bill has morphed.  I recommend this film for students enrolled in our college's AMERICAN WEST class;  it is provocative fodder for good discussion, good writing on alternative views of history.
Robert Altman fans will recognize stock characters from his other films, but will be entertained (perhaps delighted) throughout.",1041984000,3,523,5.432098765432099
878161,1,6304411391,"First of all, this is a very ugly disc. So ugly that you have to watch it on an older tube TV. There are awful distortions during big movements and some scenes look very low rez. It's not the quality of the source print that I'm talking about (which is okay), it's a really bad transfer to DVD. It's not anamorphic widescreen at all, it's letterbox. It says anamorphic here in the Amazon descriptions, but I don't think it makes this claim on the box. The too-short documentary about the making of Buffalo Bill actually looks FAR BETTER than the movie itself as far as crisp detail and the absence of compression artifacts.
Spoilers follow - Buffalo Bill has a great first half-hour and then wobbles all over the place. The movie looks like it's going to be a typical Altman Audio/Visual stew of show business, fire arms, and history. The Wild Bill show looks wonderful, the cinematography is great, the dialogue seems pretty good and the casting inspires some optimism. Then the Indians show up. Sitting Bull and William Halsey are portrayed as noble, mysterious and aloof. The movie spirals into a series of events where they confound the smarmy Bill Cody over and over. The last hour of the movie requires Newman to act more and more flustered by Sitting Bull until he has a really cringeworthy breakdown in front of the ghostly Chief.
Anyway, there's stuff for hardcore Altman fans (I'm one) to watch for. Newman is initially impressive in his role and then sputters. The pageants and attention to details that Altman excels at are well done. Ultimately the themes of showbiz and history wilt before the rambling blah of the noble savage.",1036022400,8,1642,4.724738675958188
878162,2,6304411391,"I love Robert Altman, and I am a tremendous fan of his movies (See McCabe & Mrs. Miller, The Long Goodbye, Shortcuts, etc.).  But no one hits it out of the ballpark everytime, and this effort, while having some worthwhile moments, is a dud.
I never thought an Altman movie would bore me, but this one was interminable.  He makes the point about Buffalo Bill, and hence all showbiz and celebrity (and politics), being a fraud in the first 15 minutes.  But this is a two hour plus movie, and the next hour and 45 minutes is a lot of improvised movement & wandering around that signifies nothing & conveys nothing new beyond that.
The good things about the picture are Paul Newman, Will Samson, the dignity of the man playing Sitting Bull,Burt Lancaster, and the wonderful recreation of the look of Buffalo Bill's show. ( My father saw his show as a child, and the excitement & wonder of it never left him).  But there is a whole lot of watching Newman walking around & having muddled dialogue with this one and that one, all adding up to not much.
If you want to indulge your guilt over the sorry and dreadful treatment of Native Americans knock yourself out. Even this very real subject is handled poorly here as well, the worthwhile moments overwhelmed by too much extraneous nonsense.  And, as one reviewer pointed out, the real Buffalo Bill was said to have treated the Native Americans with kindness & respect and they regarded him well.
When you are an intuitive and flexible and improvisational film-maker, as Altman is, it is inevitable that you won't bottle lightning everytime out.  And Altman has had his misfires, as has Kubrick, Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman and every other brilliant artist.  This is one.",1017446400,13,1714,4.693333333333333
878163,5,6304411391,"Of course, it was intended as a comment on a domestic policy.  And a profoundly embarrassing one at that.  Same diff.  Same mind-set.  One of Altman's best films.  (Before the post-Player downhill slide.)  Newman is wonderful.  Burt Lancaster is wonderful.  The European imigrants are generally buffoonish, but the Native Americans are presented as real people and not hyper-noble spiritual beings.  That would have been too easy.  Geraldine Chaplin is as ethereally wonderful as always - and, speaking of Chaplin, why isn't Cria Cuervos on DVD?

7871372,3,6304411391,"I would say first I was not expecting the movie to be about a rodeo circus but the actors are good and the singing was pretty with impressive clothes so it's not a awful movie but this is not educational that someone would watch in a classroom for modern schools, it was filmed in the 70's so that isn't typical for the amount of degrading for different languages. Not just towards Tribal families but also it involves The French, Spanish, English, a little Italian just because the females that perform the Opera under normal moments not in front of the audience. So the president used was Clover Cleveland but the setting was reminiscent of the early 1700's before the government was officially established that is because most of the skits for the crowd was shooting acts that from the distance of the seat benches wouldn't be seen by regular eye sight and not any scripts were performed other than riding horses that is common for shows. For a real brief history recap guns were created during the French Revolution and the Civil War made portable cannons that was around the change of battles on the East coast when the Tribes and English began offering negotiation for Peace Land ownership would get presented as Treaties for influential chiefs so despite many deaths it wasn't exactly legal to just kill settlers that weren't a part of the colony. So Buffalo Bill I never heard much about I only know about Billy The Kid Outlaw that behaved different with Natives. Lots of the jackets and leather stitch pants were likely done by Tribes so western fashion gradually mixed with the more Pagan who didn't accept Biblical Religion but by the 1700 most of the Aztec, Mayan, Incan had bred future members with Caucasians so it wasn't as primitive amongst people like Mexican or Portuguese to have similar genes as the North America turned into the Democracy. There is lots of influences that can be focused on so that it why I left off two stars the movie is worth watching but the subjects could've been more polite.

7871375,2,6304411391,"Released in 1976 and directed by Robert Altman, ""Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson"" stars Paul Newman as Buffalo Bill Cody, the star of his famous ""Wild West Show"" in the shadow of the Rockies in 1885. After Chief Sitting Bull of Little Big Horn fame (Frank Kaquitts) arrives with his Number One (Will Sampson), Cody is irked that the chief isn't a slaughtering savage, but is silently heroic and honorable. Cody fires him, but relents when star attraction Annie Oakley (Geraldine Chaplin) sympathizes with Sitting Bull. Then President Grover Cleveland (Pat McCormick ) visits with his entourage.

This is revisionist Western, a message movie that Altman uses to criticize popular ideas or myths about the Old West. The titular hero is merely a showbiz creation who can no longer differentiate the truth from his made-up image. Hes a blustering fool who asserts to be one with the Wild West, but lives in extravagance, play-acting in his Western circus. His hair is fake, he can no longer shoot straight or track a Native; and all his theatrical duels with owlhoots and Indians are fixed in his favor.

The theme is interesting and the ensemble cast is great (which also includes Burt Lancaster, Kevin McCarthy, Harvey Keitel, John Considine, Noelle Rogers, Shelley Duvall and Denver Pyle, amongst other notables). It shouldve worked, but it didnt. Its somewhat akin to Little Big Man (1970) but less of a comedy and nowhere near as entertaining (not that I'm a big fan of that movie or anything, but at least it has its entertaining moments). While the Wild West circus elicits some entertaining moments (e.g. rodeo stunts) they cant save the flick from being an arty, pretentious, tiresome bomb. Moreover, the principle Native Americans are ironically so one-dimensional and wooden I thought maybe Altman was making a snide aside about ""wooden Indians.""

Lastly, the ideology is blatantly one-sided against the New Americans, depicting Not-as-New Americans as super-noble while conveniently ignoring their documented dark side, e.g. the heinous torture tactics most tribes inflicted on their captive enemies, including other tribes-people, so as to hinder their condition in the afterlife (the ""happy hunting grounds"" or whatever). For instance, they'd gouge out enemies' eyes or mutilate their genitals so they (supposedly) wouldn't be able to see or copulate in the after-world. Yup, that's just so virtuous (sarcasm). Actually, I could handle this lopsided perspective if the movie itself were entertaining, but that's hardly the case.

The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, mostly at Stoney Indian Reserve.
