8405061,5,B003TFERBQ,"I heard of this when reading a review of ""Laughing Boy,"" a Pulitzer Prize winning book, which is written by his father, Oliver La Farge.  One of the reviewers mentioned Peter La Farge, the singer songwriter was his son.  Johnny Cash made one of Peter's songs famous, ""Ira Hayes.""  This offering is a combo of CD and DVD.  I loved the music in both.  The author produced a labor of love documenting Peter's life and tragic early death terminating his possible greatness.  There is much history documented, especially about the background of Ira Hayes ballard, who was a Marine and an Native American, a hero who had a tough time returning to society after war.  Anyone interested in artists of the time when he lived in Greenwich Village with Pete Seeger, Johnny Cash, and others will really like this package.",1412380800,2,809,4.735714285714286
8405062,4,B003TFERBQ,I am so glad they did a doc film about this unsung hero who made the world award of Ira Hayes and the cultural genocide that America perpetuated against the indidgenous people of Turtle Island (America)!!!! I'd love to see a docudrama about his life! Most folks don't know he wrote five of the eight songs on Johnny Cash's Bitter Tears album!

8405063,5,B003TFERBQ,"i can thank tom russell for a thorough introduction to peter la farge. probably a good majority of americans know or know about the ballad of ira hayes. johnny cash, clint eastwood's movie, but few of us have gone on to xplore the larger body of work of the songwriter who wrote it. this dvd fulfills that xploration & offers a brief but filling description of background and demons that produced such good writing & able singing. the lyrics in many of la farge's indian songs are way ahead of the time of the american indian movement. amazing americana. and it never ceases to amaze me that so much recognition and effort for old singers (johnny cash's twilight years) and this work for peter la farge are done by such young americans, such as sandra schulman.",1295913600,3,761,4.602941176470588
8405064,5,B003TFERBQ,"This combo DVD/CD package from independent filmmaker Sandra Schulman is a fine tribute to La Farge who, despite one Lp release on Columbia Records and many more on Folkways Records is still known primarily as the composer of Johnny Cash's hit ""The Ballad of Ira Hayes"". (The song also introduced the world to folksinger Patrick Sky.). Schulman obviously cares about her subject and on the brief 40-minute film from 2007 on the DVD she blends still photos and title slides to tell us about La Farge's personal life and tragic life (he died at age 34 in 1965 - right in the midst of the Green Village ""folk boom"" where he was a major player). La Farge was a Native American and many of his songs were about the social issues faced by his culture. For performances we are presented with two excerpts from Pete Seeger's ""Rainbow Quest"" Public-TV show - one with Seeger singing and the other with Cash and his wife June Carter. Then there is Cash performing a La Farge song on an Indian Reservation (taken from the Cash documentary ""A Man and His Music""). The only contemporary footage is the ""music video"" of Sarah Lee Guthrie and her husband Johnny Irion singing the beautiful ""I Will Bring You Flowers"". Truly the most fascinating section - for me at least - is the ONLY known footage of La Farge performing. It is from a TV show (?) hosted by folklorist Alan Lomax and features Ramblin' Jack Elliott plus La Farge's performances.

There are two ""bonus films"" included. The first is a tribute to folksinger Karen Dalton from 2009 that has a narration in French with printed quotes from her contemporaries in English. Dalton died of AIDS in 1993. The second is the music video of the song ""Drums"" featuring John Densmore (of the Doors) on drums and vocals.

The Densmore recording and the Guthrie/Irion piece are also included on the 11-track CD which comes in this package. Other tracks include La Farge songs performed by Hank Williams III, and some lesser-known artists. The Cd begins with Cash's hit version of ""Ira Hayes"" and ends - appropriately - with La Farge singing his own ""The Touriste""

As an independently produced film and CD, this package will probably fly underneath the radar. Like La Farge's own recordings (thankfully still available on line from Smithsonian Folkways), they document the all-too-brief life of this once-promising artist, one who Bob Dylan idolized for his songwriting craft. The packaging isn't fancy and the documentary contains some rare, but sometimes fuzzy, images. This is definitely a labor of love by Schulman and - as such - deserves the five star rating for getting the story of La Farge to a wider audience.

8405065,5,B003TFERBQ,"The Ballad of Peter LaFarge (DVD)
Peter LaFarge was a proto-type for a rock star, he led a life that would be the envy of any writer. He was a rodeo cowboy, actor, playwright, folksinger, painter, manic depressive, drug user, all the things that burn in talent and leave legend in it's wake.

Lafarge was born in New York, his mother, Wanden LaFarge, an heiress, who was of American Indian heritage, and his father, Oliver LaFarge, a scholar of American Indian culture and Pulitzer Prize winning author who wrote ""Laughing Boy,"" a novel about an American Indian boy. After Peter's parents divorced he moved with his mother to Colorado and she married a rancher. Peter came of age in the west of real cowboys and Indians and he grew to know their lives and stories, he showed his first signs of artistic interest, painting murals on the walls of the house. He joined the Navy and was nearly killed in an explosion and he started to display the first signs of erratic behavior that would lead to mental illness. After the Navy, he moved to Chicago where studied at the Goodman theater to be an actor, later moving to New York to be in an off-Broadway show; he tried his hand at writing plays, and at the time Greenwich Village was rife with folksingers, he played his songs, befriended Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, and influenced a young Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. He was the first Greenwich folksinger to be signed by Columbia records, and put a remarkable six albums in four years. He had a hit with ""The Ballad of Ira Hayes"" a song about the American Indian that helped raise the flag on Iwo Jima in World War II (and one of the main characters in Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Father's"").

In a brief forty minutes, director, Sandra Hale Schulman gives us LaFarge's life, quotes from contemporaries such as Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash. Cash's efforts to promote his friends work throughout the years are included, clips from Pete Seeger's television show Rainbow Quest with Johnny Cash and June Carter, to his recording an album of LaFarge's songs, to carrying out some of LaFarge's legacy in working with American Indian causes throughout his life. There are also interviews with friends, and a rare film of the only known footage of LaFarge performing.

LaFarge's legacy reminds me a bit of Kerouac, an innovator in his medium whose legacy wasn't immediately apparent and his personal shortcomings echoed down to his offspring. But the redemption of the failings is to notice the work of Peter LaFarge and acknowledge it's influence in the world.

""The Ballad of Peter LaFarge"" and ""Rare Breed"" is a 2 disc package. The DVD also includes the video of LaFarge's song ""Drums"" with John Densmore, the drummer of The Doors not only playing the drums but assisting on vocals with Floyd ""Red Crow"" Westerman, the song itself is included on the accompanying CD ""Rare Breed.""

Rare Breed (CD)
The first thing that strikes you about ""Rare Breed"" is it's crisp sound grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. Despite the fact that Peter LaFarge's died 45 years ago, LaFarge's lyrics sound as fresh and vital as any CD by a new artist.

Sandra Schulman also produced the CD (she wrote, directed and produced ""The Ballad of Peter LaFarge""). Each of the artists on ""Rare Breed"" produced their own songs and the artists offer their own and varied interpretations of LaFarge's songs but none violate the spirit or intent of LaFarge's songs. Listening to ""Rare Breed"" it's clear that Lafarge was ahead of his time not only in lifestyle but in the content of his songs. There's a Robert Johnson quality to LaFarge's songs but without the pop and hiss of sounding like antediluvian recordings.

Johnny Cash opens the CD with perhaps what is LaFarge's signature song ""The Ballad of Ira Hayes"" and Cash's clear and strong voice gives the song a powerful immediacy.

""Drums"" features John Densmore, of The Doors on what else, the drums and for the first time (as the credits say) on vocals. Floyd ""Red Crow"" Westerman is also featured on the track. There is also a video of the song that is included on the accompanying DVD.

""Bad Girl"" by John Trudell has a real Rock `n' Roll feel to it, just in the lyrics, it wouldn't sound out of place on any rock album either from the 60's or now.

Sarah Lee Guthrie's (grand daughter of Woody) and Johhny Irion's cover of ""I Will Bring You Flowers"" sounds like it could've come out of San Francisco in 1968.

Hank (Williams) III adds a punk twist to ""Marijuana Blues.""

And Peter LaFarge is allowed to close out the CD in his own voice with the funny tale of ""The Touriste.""

I know it sounds clich but hopefully ""The Ballad of Peter LaFarge"" and ""Rare Breed"" will trigger a resurgence of interest in Peter LaFarge and his work, and this DVD/CD is great for anybody interested in discovering some great music from an artist who won`t continue to linger in the shadows. Sandra Schulman will also be publishing a biography of LaFarge coming in Spring of 2011. If the ""The Ballad of Peter LaFarge"" and ""Rare Breed"" are any indication, I'm looking forward to reading the book.",1277596800,9,5102,4.680803571428571
8405066,5,B003TFERBQ,"The Ballad of Peter LaFarge reveals its protagonist as a complex, haunted writer of complex, haunted songs. Too often minimized merely as a contemporary of Bob Dylan and the writer of the Johnny Cash hit Ira Hayes, the LaFarge of this Kevin Welch-narrated short is a fascinating, mystery-shrouded bolt of creativity. Rare photos and original music abound in this one. Peter Cooper, The Tennessean",1277164800,,396,5.203125
