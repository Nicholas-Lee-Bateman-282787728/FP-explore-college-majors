3551456,3,B001EDWAGY,"I was so excited to see this show being released on DVD!!! But what we get is acctually very disapointing, its not the content The show is great but its the LACK of content, Its hard for me to believe that they could only put 9 episodes on this set of three dvd's they could have easily made this a 24 episode set!!!! and then on top of that to charge $20 for 9 episodes come on food network this should have been about $5 then I wouldn't complain....",1341187200,9,451,4.078651685393258
3551457,5,B001EDWAGY,The dvd set was purchased for a gift.  My sister loved it!  She would recommend it to others who like this show on Food Network.,1324944000,,128,4.08
3551458,5,B001EDWAGY,"I actually ordered this DVD for my 12-year-old daughter - we watch Food Network together, and Unwrapped is her favorite show!  It is really interesting and enjoyable to watch for any age.  It shares how common things we see/eat every day are made from beginning to end.  We've watched it over & over together.",1320451200,,309,4.685185185185185
3551459,5,B001EDWAGY,"""Unwrapped"" is an ultimate DVD set for people who are the faint-at-heart in craving the foods and drinks we love so well. Host Marc Summers gives you an inside look at the history and pop culture behind the famous brands featured and how they are made before you buy these products. I was amazed at learning how one grocery store carried at least 100 varieties of soda pop and had tons of memories with the Retro Candy episode, noting sweet-toothed classics like Necco Wafers, Mary Jane Peanut Butter Chews, and Mallo Cups. My only disappointment with the DVD was that I wish it contained more episodes since ""Unwrapped"" has been on the Food Network for years. This set was well worth the money!",1315958400,,695,4.658536585365853
3551460,3,B001EDWAGY,There could be a lot more segments per disk. There are 3 disks that could easily be condensed into 1. The segments cover multiple years and could easily be expanded.,1288656000,7,165,4.533333333333333
3551461,5,B001EDWAGY,I really like this dvd set personally because i like food and i like to see how things are made so for me it goes perfectly. I would recommend this for anyone who likes food or just likes to see how things are made.,1269129600,3,215,3.909090909090909
3551462,5,B001EDWAGY,"After a long day at work, I don't want to make conversation over dinner.  But I also don't want to waste an hour watching a TV show.  Unwrapped lets me enjoy my dinner and not loose half of my evening.  The shows are about 20 minutes in length and PERFECT for the end of the day or just a needed break in your day!",1267401600,3,314,3.875
3551463,2,B001EDWAGY,"This show is top notch.  The best Food Network has to offer!  However, the DVD set only has 9 episodes over all three discs.  It should have at least eight episodes per disc!  Shame on the Food Network for treating their best show with one of the shabbiest treatments on DVD.",1250035200,27,275,4.333333333333333

8297928,5,B001EDWAGY,"More please! This is so great. We don't have cable and we SO enjoy this show. Sadly, you can only find a handful of shows on dvd /instant streaming. I hope they remedy that one day. Great set of episodes.",1439769600,3,204,4.125

8297932,5,B001EDWAGY,My girlfriend and I used to watch Good Eats and Unwrapped on Food Network. Sadly she never let me watch Emeril Live while she was awake.,1398902400,,136,4.269230769230769
8297933,5,B001EDWAGY,the seller shipped on time and it also arrived on time. The DVD is brand new and is still sealed. It was also packed very carefully. It looked like someone really took their time and effort in making sure that it was packed and shipped correctly,1391990400,,245,4.3478260869565215
8297934,5,B001EDWAGY,"I am a Family and Consumer Ed. teacher and I bought these to show my foods classes.

8297936,1,B001EDWAGY,"When one gets commercial advertisement within a purchased DVD (movie type) then the whole meaning of the DVD is totally lost...Food channel advertisements spoiled the whole concept....Paula Dean advertisemnet along with the others that was added to this DVD makes the worth of the DVD zero........If I want to watch commercials I don't need a DVD.........I wasted my money...
