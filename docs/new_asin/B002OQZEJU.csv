8376383,1,B002OQZEJU,"I'd hoped for some snazzy ""super train"" footage in this movie but instead there were just some brief shots of a very unbelievable toy model that was supposed to be some magnificent conveyance.  The story itself is a tepid romance that could have been played in any hotel or drawing room.  The only plot connection to the train itself is a woman who is trying to get to California before her baby is born so she can enjoy a specific bequest.  If you're looking for a good train-race yarn, pick up The Silver Streak, which features the Burlington Northern Comet in some excellent rail scenes.  Meanwhile, avoid this film like the flu.",1313971200,4,632,4.616071428571429
8376384,3,B002OQZEJU,"This is a cute movie with some good actors.  It is a melodrama romance spiced with commedy.  It is currently the only available version of this movie.  There is also a VHS tape and this DVD is just a rip of that tape.  Absolutely nothing has been done to improve the movie other than cutting out a funny scene where the original film slipped and the framing was off.  So if you want a more complete version go for the VHS.  The sound is passable, but with a fair amount of hiss.  The picture has a large number of lines, pops, and flashes from the deteriorated film.  At one time the VHS version was much cheaper than the DVD.  But now the DVD is available from Movies Unlimited for $10 and the VHS is much higher.  Since the DVD has picture and sound identical to the VHS version except for the missing scene, you can do better to get the VHS copy if the price is reasonable.

Hopefully someone will come up with a decent copy of the film and using some good software a better DVD can be produced.  While the production is enjoyable, the quality of transfer is not bey good.",1282953600,4,1075,4.241379310344827
