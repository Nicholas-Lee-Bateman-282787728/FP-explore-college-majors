It was cute, humorous, funny, relatable, and magnificently portrayed of how we never know what life can and will throw our way. All of the acting was great and the best feel good movie I could have chosen for myself to watch. I experienced many emotions while watching the movie because there were so many parts that I could truly relate to. Robinne Lee truly made her character believable and Gabriele Union was hilarious in her role. Makes you realize how important it is to discover what makes you happy and how important it is to go after those things.

5457849,4,B00AN10MWW,"While the camera work could be better, there's not much to complain about with this flick. In fact, being as the movie takes place in single living sized rooms (office, kitchen etc...) I can't really complain about that either. maybe the actors just needed to be busier, flicking through a magazine or something whilst on the phone. Who knows? :-)

If you're looking for something different, this is it. Especially if you're a woman ... or a gay guy. this is 100% a 'smush' flick I don't say 'chick flick' it's sexist against men look like these movies) :-)

It's got a great pace, excellent dialogue and the score doesn't slap you in the face.

... the settings of the main 2 characters are very similar. Very clean. The guys place should have been counter to the girls ... but that's a set dressing issue, you probably won't even notice it :-)

I'm rambling now I'll leave you with this: If you want something you haven't seen before, this is for you. The best rom-com since SERENDIPITY :-)",1398816000,3,992,4.556179775280899
5457850,5,B00AN10MWW,"I love this movie.  It's right up there with Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (another of my favorites which has a similar sort of storyline because it happens in one day).  I want to mention though that I wish they had shown different people on the front of the movie cover.  Only two of the people on the front are significant characters.  It seems odd to me.

This movie is fun because the main character is very likeable.  It's easy to sympathize with her and you know there's going to be the scent of romance budding from friendship somewhere in this movie from the teaser.  The guy who places the protagonist is also very likeable and a very enjoyable character.  The chemistry between the two is great!

I'd recommend this one if you loved Miss Pettigrew.  And if you love this one, I'd recommend the other to you!  This movie is so much better than the trailer makes it seem like it is going to be...",1394064000,2,906,4.365269461077844

5457853,5,B00AN10MWW,"It's been sooooo long since I've seen a funny, awesome movie! This movie was wonderful. I loved this movie. It was HILARIOUS! Romantic too. She is a customer rep and has to listen to people call and complain about the products of the company that she works for. Those people that call in are so funny! I would hate being stuck in my apartment all day like she is. So she feels disconnected from the real world so she just dials some random numbers and after a while she gets an EMT on the phone who is soo dreamy- Sam Jaeger from Parenthood. Of course they click and talk on the phone all the time. And then there is Jon Huertas, from Castle, who is her skeevy boyfriend. He is a real piece of work, man! I want to know why Sam Jaeger is not on the front cover on the case since he is the guy that she spends most of her time talking to. SAM JAEGER IS SO FINE!!!",1376179200,2,862,4.046783625730995

Although I'm not usually a fan of movies with little to no action or movement, Miss Dial kept me engaged and intrigued from beginning to end. The lead character, Erica, was endearing and surprisingly relatable. In the end you find yourself saying, ""I'm so happy for her!""

It's actually an interracial love story and I really liked it! My mom, sis and I watched it and we were ready to see a bad movie and it ended with us wanting to own it. It has a few bad words, but never gets dirty or unbearable. I was really waiting to see an awful film but found that this is a well done low budget film. Lots of cameo's from working actors you've seen around and the main guy in this story (Sam Jaeger)is in another independent film I saw that was really cute too called ""Take Me Home"" and I recommend that as well.",1365638400,2,652,3.9097744360902253

5457863,1,B00AN10MWW,I was highly disappointed with this movie.  Unfortunately it did not work for me.  It was slow and the story line didn't make a lot of sense.  I ordered this as a treat on a rainy day.  I was all set with the pop corn and it fell flat.,1365120000,,235,3.7346938775510203

5457865,4,B00AN10MWW,"Writer-director David H. Steinberg's 2013 romantic comedy/fantasy MISS DIAL requires you to suspend a good amount of disbelief.  For example, from what we can see of lead character Erica's apartment, it looks pretty nice and yet she seems to be paying for it on the salary of a customer service representative.  But thanks to its witty, fast-moving story and an engrossing performance by Robinne Lee as Erica, MISS DIAL keeps that and a few other too-convenient plot devices from distracting you.

Until its final moments, MISS DIAL takes place in that well-kept home, venturing no farther than locations of individuals with whom Erica communicates by telephone we see via split screen.  When I realized this film wasn't going to include a car chase or bar fight I wondered if it was originally a stage play, but from what I can tell it is only a movie.

MISS DIAL may appeal to phone freaks more than it does to me, as I'm not one for blabbing on the telephone.  God knows there are those who find intimacy holding that handset, the mobile phone era a godsend.  But I can't deny feeling Erica's rush when she decides to knock off her customer service calls to instead randomly phone strangers, just to talk.  I wondered if MISS DIAL would prove a slice of life, perhaps challenging the audience with no real payoff other than a look at this woman as she whimsically dials one unknown person after another.  However, as I don't want to give away too much of the story, I'll just say MISS DIAL ventures into both the heartbreak and thrill of romance.  Those better at picking up hints might guess how all this wraps up, but it pleased me to be caught by surprise.

FACEBOOK is also used to move along the MISS DIAL plot.  And while some time ago I un-friended my handful of ""friends"" after pondering the vapidity of it, those who can't get enough of the web site will find MISS DIAL that much more topical.

See MISS DIAL.  As I write this on March 31, 2013, it dawns on me that this fun little film may have gone from the theaters to D.V.D./television as quickly as you let a strange phone number on your caller I.D. (Has Erica called you?) go to voice mail, if MISS DIAL even played on the big screen.  Here's hoping MISS DIAL finds the audience it deserves.  You'll root for Erica to find what she wants.",1364688000,2,2306,4.5204819277108435
5457866,4,B00AN10MWW,It was actually a good movie even though I was kind of upset  because I thought Dule Hill  was going to be the love interest. I'm a big Psych fan. It was kind of refreshing at times I did  just wanted her to get out that damn apartment which kind of played into the plot. Over all it was a good movie with an interesting plot and romantic ending.,1364083200,2,346,3.9855072463768115

5457870,5,B00AN10MWW,"The best romantic comedies (Pretty Woman, As Good As It Gets, Bull Durham, Knocked Up) often remind us that, not only do we need other people, but that they also better us.  Miss Dial, David Steinberg's newest film, charmingly succeeds at doing the same.  Steinberg, a master of raunchy, gross-out comedy (he wrote or co-wrote several of the American Pie films and the hilariously bawdy coming-of-age novel Last Stop This Town), has created a subtle, engaging, and relentlessly funny character study about the profitable, if painful, self-improvement occurring when the right person enters one's life.

 Miss Dial is Erica (an outstanding Robinne Lee), a home-based consumer products customer service rep who (with a smiling, repressed contempt) fields calls from morons and weirdos befuddled by her company's usually self-explanatory products.  After one moron too many, Erica takes a break from her caller queue and, attempting to call a friend, misdials an Afghanistan War vet in North Carolina.  An engrossing conversation ensues, prompting Erica to keep dialing random numbers to talk to strangers, most of whom provide the honest, unscripted human contact she didn't know she needed.  Her last ""misdial"" brings her to Kyle (an excellent Sam Jaeger), with whom she develops an increasingly romantic rapport.  Kyle goads Erica, however charmingly, towards a self-understanding prompting reconsideration of her relationships, personal and professional.

 Miss Dial also meditates upon what, as another reviewer observed, is perhaps the great irony of our age:  technology has made us at once intimate and estranged.  People increasingly prefer social networks, texts, and telephones to real, human contact.  Resultantly, one may know a person's favorite books, music, and foods and not really know him or her.  Couple that with the perma-smiling personae workplaces oblige employees to adopt (as Erica does with flagging success throughout the story) to handle a cretinous, consuming public and one realizes how we can interact with others constantly and yet learn nothing about them or ourselves.

 Technically speaking, Steinberg's writing and direction are right on.  His plotting is a textbook example of screenwriter William Goldman's demand:  ""Give the audience what it wants, not what it expects.""  And the spare, split-screen rendering of the characters' phone conversations captures the sense of phony intimacy technology allows while focusing attention upon the actors' masterful performances.

 Mr. Steinberg has done a mitzvah in creating Miss Dial.  It deserves the widest possible audience.",1363392000,12,2607,5.580152671755725

It's one of those movies that makes you believe in love & chance encounters!  Robinne Lee & Sam Jaeger were both very funny and had excellent chemistry.  I also loved the cameos in the movie!  Gabrielle Union was very funny as were Dule Hill & Hill Harper!  Great cast & definitely a movie that I will keep in my collection when I need some laughs!  I've recommended this movie to ALL of my friends!  It's movies like this that are hidden gems, I can't tell you how many times I've been disappointed by theatrical releases that fell very short.

Watch Miss Dial, and thank me later!  You will love it!",1363305600,6,724,4.458015267175573
5457872,5,B00AN10MWW,"Produced on a shoestring budget, MISS DIAL is a marvel.  Gorgeous to watch, full of laughs and surprises, with real heart.  Refreshingly non-ironic with a keen sense of character and relationships.  It's a winner!",1363219200,3,213,5.205882352941177
5457873,5,B00AN10MWW,"I absolutely loved this movie.  It was everything I would hope for from a Romantic Comedy.  It was actually laugh out loud funny and incredibly touching without being cheesy.  Not only are the two leads captivating, but all of the supporting characters are so fun! I literally wept at the end, which is a sure sign that this film is a success!  Put on your p.j.'s, grab a glass of wine, and curl up with Miss Dial.  You won't be disappointed.",1363046400,9,442,4.407407407407407
5457874,5,B00AN10MWW,"This movie is HYSTERICAL. I saw it at a screening in LA with a bunch of friends, and we were in the corner clutching our stomachs dying of laughter. Although this movie is definitely a romantic comedy, the underlying theme is about two people accidentally connecting in a disconnected world. The intimacy of their conversations is contrasted by a series of hilarious phone calls from people seeking customer service from the main character Erica.  Through sharp, funny writing, and without being pedantic, this movie conveys the 21st century dilemma of having so many means of communicating but not being able to communicate at all (please describe your potato shredder). It is sad that this movie did not enjoy a wider theater release.",1362787200,10,736,5.032786885245901
5457875,5,B00AN10MWW,Saw Miss Dial last night and laughed out loud as did most of the audience.  Can't wait to see it again on DVD.  Funny and heartwarming movie.  I would highly recommend seeing it.,1362700800,,178,4.333333333333333
5457876,5,B00AN10MWW,"Went to the screening last night. Really enjoyed the movie. It starts with an original idea, which is developed with a smart and entertaining dialogue. Funny and warm, but also relevant to many issues (lack of meaningful connections with others, losing sight of our dreams, settling for less).",1362700800,2,293,5.125
5457877,5,B00AN10MWW,"This movie does a great job giving the audience laugh-out-loud moments while paying off the romantic storyline using a very clever and original concept.  The lead actors, Robinne Lee and Sam Jaeger, exhibit amazing chemistry.",1362700800,,225,5.428571428571429
5457878,5,B00AN10MWW,"We went to a special screening of MISS DIAL last night and it was such a unique concept for a movie.  Not only was the audience laughing throughout the entire movie, but the ending was so touching and emotional. The chemistry between the two lead actors (Robinne Lee and Sam Jaeger) was palpable.  I felt myself rooting for them individually and as a potential couple...Dave Steinberg needs to write a sequel so that we can see what happens between Erica and Kyle!!! Will definitely need to see this one again and again.",1362700800,,520,4.641304347826087
8554450,5,B00AN10MWW,"Great movie.  It was refreshing to see characters talk long enough to determine if they liked each other instead of hopping into bed because of lust.  Great metaphors.  When we don't trust or develop our instincts we convince ourselves that things are better than they are.  The main characters job was to placate customers which in tern made her placatable.
I am okay with being pulled in by two of my favorite actors Dule Hill and Gabriel Union to learn a life lesson.  I loved how Sam Jaeger's character talked about how people who love Olive Garden think they are eating authentic Italian food.  Shout out to O.G. I love the Zuppa Toscana, stuffed mushrooms, and calamari.  Do people even wait for or seek their  best (without a side chick or side dude) anymore?",1522540800,,766,4.664179104477612

8554452,3,B00AN10MWW,"I actually really liked the dialogue in this movie and thought the actor who played the love interest Kyle did a great job, he was no natural and endearing. The main actress was pretty, but overacted. I wish actors would learn and master their craft rather than relying on fake laughing and fake crying with no actual tears. Gabrielle Union and Dule Hill are on the cover, but that's just good marketing because they were in the film for a minute each. The main chick--the character not the actress--was so broken it was hard to watch because I'm sure as women we've all fallen for the wrong guy and no one could talk sense into us. I wanted to shake her! TG she had good friends. She had a sweet quality even despite the poor acting, so I really rooted for her in the end. Yay to genuine connections.",1500940800,,801,4.382550335570469

And, I am now a fan of Robinne Lee. Most of all, I loved the diverse cast used within this film. It is a really cute movie with a message. .",1500336000,,284,3.830508474576271
