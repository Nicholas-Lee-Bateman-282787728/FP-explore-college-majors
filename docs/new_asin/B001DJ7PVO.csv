8293780,4,B001DJ7PVO,"Bought this series for my 4 year old to introduce her to Sesame Street. In the past year, she has only watched one DVD. I'm not sure if its because of the quality of the show or just her taste. She did like the DVD she watched. Very good quality DVD",1420848000,,249,3.9019607843137254
8293781,4,B001DJ7PVO,This was purchased as a gift - and it was well received. Who wouldn't like multiple Elmo DVD's. I sure couldn't pass up the price. Order was very smooth-no issues.,1399075200,,163,4.466666666666667
8293782,5,B001DJ7PVO,"got this for my daughter and she looooves it !
3 movies for less than $20 not bad at all. especially considering that if you go to the store they each cost $15 and up individually.
so if your child is an Elmo addict like my daughter.. you'll love this deal.",1357516800,,257,4.0588235294117645

8293784,5,B001DJ7PVO,This is very entertaining and educational for kids.  I didn't expect this from this DVD series.  I am so happy I got this for my son,1253491200,,132,4.038461538461538
8293785,5,B001DJ7PVO,"My son loves these videos! He is 21 months and enjoys mimicing the dialog between characters. He also cracks himself up when trying to make the noises from the fire engine [firehouse] and the animals [doctor]. The Friends to the Rescue DVD doesn't hold his attention at all, however. He's more a fan of Elmo and since this one focuses more on Big Bird, he turns off the television. But it's a great video to try again when he's a bit older. I sit with him when we watch them and we talk and practice what the videos highlight about having a fire and/or going to the doctor.",1231200000,,573,4.314814814814815
