6087326,5,B00GMTQI86,"These are all fun no brainer entertainment starring Matthew McConaughey before he started acting in some the more serious fare after he moved into his 40's and beyond.  This set includes four of the romantic comedies he made where he always seemed to be shirtless and a player.  All of the films are enjoyable.  My favorite is the ""Failure to Launch"".  My least favorite is ""Fool's Gold"" as it's a little silly, but still watchable with great sun baked paradise scenery.  This set had the DVD's stacked on top of one another which I don't like.  I ended up having to transfer the discs to an empty four DVD case so that they have their own compartments.  I bought this set when it was marked down to $6, so it was worth it to have this at $2 a movie.  Definite steal.",1485302400,,767,4.352112676056338

Well, ok, then! I LOVE that this was not a single multi-movie DVD, but it is 4 separate, clearly labeled disks.

If you do not like Chick Flicks - skip this one, but if you do, this is for you!!!!! ALSO - I will say that my hubby seemed to enjoy Fools' Gold and Failure to Launch (and Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates ROCKED in that one as well!).
