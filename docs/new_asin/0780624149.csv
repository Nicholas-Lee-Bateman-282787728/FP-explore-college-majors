7789478,3,0780624149,"This is another clip-show WCW put out during their lucrative years when they were the top promotion in the world. Bash at the Beach has a reputation as one of their better shows every year (and some would argue it was their biggest show, even eclipsing Starrcade under Bischoff's reign). This tape gives us highlights from 1992-1997, showcasing their version of ""the most memorable matches"". That means we're in for A LOT of Hogan, so hold on, brother!

Hogan gets several showcases, including his debut Title match vs. Flair, a Cage match with Vader, and a tag team match with Dennis Rodman. None of the matches are great, but we're at least spared from any real atrocities on here. If there was any event Hogan seemed to bring his A-game for, it was the annual summer spectacular.

Other matches like Sting and The British Bulldog against the Masters of the Powerbomb and Ric Flair vs. Roddy Piper are forgettable. Yet there are two great matches highlighted here: the first is the 1996 main event that started the NWO (every fan should see this match) and a Falls Count Anywhere match between Sting and Cactus Jack that was a constant barrage of bodily abuse.

Overall, there's no point in watching tapes like this anymore unless it holds some special nostalgic value for you. Seeing WCW as they promoted themselves is enough to get me watching it ever once in a great while.",1407024000,,1378,4.70954356846473
7789479,3,0780624149,"Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this old WCW one from 1998.  This VHS only last around an hour & is just highlights of the main matches from this event over the years.  Highlights of the matches include Sting vs. Cactus Jack in a Falls Count Anywhere Match from 1992, the ""Masters Of The Powerbomb"" in Vader & Sid vs. Sting & ""British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith in 1993, and Ric Flair vs. Roddy Piper from 1997.  Hulk Hogan's presence is heavily showcased on this tape as all his matches from this event are highlighted such as his debut vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair in 1994, his cage match vs. Vader in 1995, the birth of the nWo in 1996, and his tag match with Dennis Rodman vs. Giant & Lex Luger in 1997.

Now this tape was a treat back when it was released but but these days with DVD or internet videos, you aren't really missing anything here as most of the matches on here have been released in full over the years so this something I would recommend at a very low price for a quick trip down memory lane of WCW.",1300060800,,1090,4.1761904761904765
7789480,3,0780624149,"While the matches in this tape are not bad,the only thing that the fans are going to remember about this tape is the infamous Hulk Hogan heel turn. Nothing else. I give this VHS a 7 out of 10.",1279670400,,192,3.948717948717949
7789481,3,0780624149,this was a little better then most of the best of wcw videos but only rentable quality. its got the birth of the nwo to the very first one which was cactus jack vs. sting. then they go to hogan/flair in 94. then to 96  when hogan turned heel and the nwo was formed. then they also put the 97  one on there.,963964800,2,306,3.8412698412698414
7789482,2,0780624149,I was very disappointed in this video it showed some of the worst matches in Bash at the Beach history. The only good thing is it showed the transformation of Hulk Hogan to Hollywood Hogan that's the only reason it  doesen't get one star.,943228800,2,238,4.409090909090909
7789483,5,0780624149,"This video us a must see for Bast at the Beach fans. It has Sting,Rick Flair,and the deut of the Outsiders. It is a good price for a good movie.",921110400,,144,3.8333333333333335
7789484,5,0780624149,"This video rocks the house with unbelievable summaries of some of the greatest matches to ever go down in the July WCW Pay Per View event named Bash at the Beach.
