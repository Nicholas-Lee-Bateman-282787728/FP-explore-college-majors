4665270,5,B005EHNXPI,"For those who don't surf, you may not realize the racial divide that exists in the water...but it's there. White Wash does an amazing job at describing what this divide is, why it's existed and showcases how it's slowly being taken away with the 21st Century tide. Whether you like surfing movies, music from the likes of Ben Harper, or even just learning a little bit about another area where segregation still exists today, do yourself a favor and check out White Wash.",1318636800,2,471,4.686746987951807
4665271,4,B005EHNXPI,"I was really blown away by how thought provoking, intentional and informative this film proved to be. I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but after the first 15 minutes, I was completely engrossed in its subject matter. There are many interesting points this film raises about race relations in our country, our individual relationship with our country's past, and how we've all been affected and still are by the lingering racism that permeates even the most organic forms of physical expression and connection with the earth - surfing. Without being preachy or feeling like you're back in History 101, this movie reminds you that history (although quite relative depending on who's writing) is directly connected to the present and future. And there's a lot of great surfing and solid music to accompany... I've already recommended to several people - you don't have to be a surfer to appreciate this film. Really cool stuff.",1318636800,3,930,5.006451612903226
4665272,5,B005EHNXPI,"I loved this film! It was educational and entertaining.  This film depicts the plight of the African American surfer.  It has a beautiful way of unraveling the history of surfing, it's roots and what people of color had to overcome to even get into the water.  Prejudice is everywhere and in bringing topics as this one to the public eye the door is open for acceptance of ALL people.  Everyone should see this film!",1318636800,3,416,4.581081081081081
4665273,5,B005EHNXPI,"This movie was completely fascinating!! I did not know what to expect, and to be honest, going in I just didn't relate racism with surfing. I was struck and saddened by the irony of a sport in which the element one ""competes"" against (the wave/creation) knows no color, and yet ""non-whites"" have had to compete against more than just the waves in order to show they belong.

The historical information of surfing provided in this movie was extremely helpful. I felt that the movie went beyond just surfing and racism, but highlighted the role that perceptions (both individual and cultural) play in shaping and forming not only the choices we make in our lives, but even our ethics and values.

This movie was informative, and stirred emotions that were both heart-breaking and hopeful. It is definitely a MUST SEE!",1318636800,3,815,4.856115107913669
4665274,5,B005EHNXPI,"I was absolutely amazed when I saw White Wash.  I walked into the theater having no idea what to expect and left with so much information.  Before seeing this film, I bought into all of the stereotypes and cliches that surround ""surfing"".  I can't believe how wrong I was.

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great documentary or is interested in learning something new.  You won't be sorry.",1318636800,,402,4.605633802816901
4665275,5,B005EHNXPI,"Unbelievable film! In fact, it exceeded my expectations as this film explores the history of surfing, not just ""black"" surfing but surfing in general like no other! It takes you on a journey of consciousness through the African-American experience along with the Polynesian culture that shows you why there aren't more surfers of color in the water. The footage is just down right captivating and I watched it twice so far. Trust me, you will not be disappointed, you have to watch this film!!!",1318550400,2,494,4.892857142857143
4665276,1,B005EHNXPI,"It shouldn't have even been rated that, but you have to check one. ""White Wash"" when it was first presented to me, I thought it had a good starting point. Then the project disappeared. It has resurfaced again in 2011 right at the perfect moment, election time. This movie is so horrible in its message (I am not even sure there was a message) and repetitive nature that literally, I had to pause calm down and try it again. I am first hand watching the events going on in black surfing (I am quite familiar with the majority in this movie)and this movie will bring everything a lot of people have worked for crashing straight to the ground. There is nothing inspirational, nothing. There are black surfers all over the world. This movie doesn't come close to representing the true nature of what it means to be a black surfer. This is a group of friends who got together and said, ""Let's make the first black surf movie."" With the exception of Buttons K, this movie is about the BSA. Who does not help in anyway to work towards the progression of getting more black people involved in surfing. The plaque they show at Inkwell Beach Santa Monica, CA was a result of someone finally stepping forward to move black surfers into the new millennium not take the back of the bus again. They added Kelly Slater, Rob Machado, Sam George, and Sal Masekela for ticket sales. OMG this is a beast of some sickening nature. Hypocrisy is not the new black.",1318291200,,1442,4.50763358778626
4665277,4,B005EHNXPI,"The power of modern-day documentaries is the ability to shatter stereotypes.  White Wash does just that by taking a look at the cultural phenomenon of surfing and exposing the truths about the present-day situation that exists surrounding the sport.  The movie on surfaces seems to only be about chronicling the lives of Black-American surfers, but underneath the waves is an attempt to show the historical results from racist segregation that have created a situation that has lead to an almost invisible presence of people of color in surfing and other aquatic sports.  While the film can at times become ""soapbox"", it maintains a sincerity in the message that the individuals that love surfing, are brave enough to endure the delusions other while finding solace trying ""ride"" the waves of the oceans.  White Wash is a part of a 21st-Century band of films exposing the counter-cultural lifestyles of many Black-Americans that goes against the mainstream views and expectations that exists in America at large and specifically within the Black community.  This is an excellent film that shows how much more their is to American life than that which is exposed to millions through media images.",1325116800,,1195,5.139175257731959
4665278,5,B005EHNXPI,"This is the first review I have ever written, but after viewing this movie I feel compelled to share my reactions.  I knew it was about surfing, but the subtle title left me wondering.  The way it interweaves the history of the sport with the racial history of the USA is incredibly well done.  The narrative is so honest and so revealing that I found myself wanting to know the surfers personally.  They strike me as exceptional people who, against considerable odds, have pursued their passion for enjoying the powers of the ocean in a way that few of us have experienced.  I have always viewed surfing as a sport to be watched.  This movie makes me see it as an activity to do!  The movie also stirred my emotions in so many directions that to recount them would be banal.  I had never heard of ""The Roots"", but I enjoyed the music enough to want to become more familiar with their music.  It is an incredible product that will not only give you an enlightened perspective about history, race relations and surfing, but will move you to head for the beach.",1319673600,5,1059,4.473958333333333
4665279,5,B005EHNXPI,Totally reccommend this movie! An inspiring story of opposition and couragous heart.  White wash is a voice of an untold story in the surfing industry. The soundtrack is also stellar!,1319068800,,183,5.1
4665280,5,B005EHNXPI,"Aside from being a very well-crafted, insightful documentary about surfing...this movie represents history truthfully and educates the viewer in the process. The music is beautiful and personal and I really felt connected to the film overall. Great surfing sequences, too!!",1318982400,,273,5.85
4665281,5,B005EHNXPI,"Would you like to learn a little bit about history? Listen to the stories of a few incredible people? Share the vision of Ted Woods and crew? See this movie!! Every time I watch it, it gets better and better.. Really a brilliant, well thought out production.",1318809600,,258,4.51063829787234
4665282,4,B005EHNXPI,This is a very interesting film about far more than surfing. The juxtaposition of archival footage and current-day interviews provides an engaging narrative about both the history of surfing and of race perceptions and relations in the U.S.,1318809600,3,240,5.342105263157895
4665283,5,B005EHNXPI,"White Wash is an interesting film that captures the beauty of surfing while making you think about contemporary racial issues.  It opened my eyes to a world I didn't know existed.  Informative and beautifully shot, there is heart and soul, intelligence and depth in this wonderful film.",1318723200,4,286,5.0638297872340425
4665284,5,B005EHNXPI,"I saw the film in a theater in New York and am ordering it to own.  The film was informative, insipirational and truly enjoyable to watch. It tackles a complex issue and provides a great historical framework.  The soundtrack is awesome. Definitely not just for surfers-- I highly recommend it for all.",1318723200,3,301,4.769230769230769
4665285,5,B005EHNXPI,"This is a fantastic documentary, engaging from start to finish. This film is a fresh take on the conversation about race in America. It's wonderfully informative and explores the construction of race all within the context of surfing. These two topics complement each other perfectly; there's the tension and turbulence of race relations and then there's the beauty and freedom of riding a wave and being in harmony with nature.  The Roots are one of my favorite bands of all time, so watching surf footage to their music while being intellectually stimulated is about as good as it gets.",1318723200,3,588,4.9393939393939394
4665286,5,B005EHNXPI,i really enjoyed this movie!  it's thought provoking with great interviews. and the smooth sultry voice of ben harper too.  check it out to learn more about the complexity surrounding race and surfing and to watch the script get flipped on endless summer.,1318723200,,255,4.906976744186046

8468247,4,B005EHNXPI,Great insight on African American and surfing and why there is not much blacks in surfing.,1439856000,,90,4.6875
8468248,2,B005EHNXPI,"Bad copy and did not open until after my seven days were up.so couldn't watch the full movie without it skipping . Great Movie but the quality of the DVD was horible , Im sure its a manufacture malfunction because when I saw this movie initaly at school there was no problem. I would recomend this DVD to the world young and older",1399593600,,330,4.253968253968254
8468249,5,B005EHNXPI,"I can't get this film out of my mind...to say that it was well done is an understatement.  The movie perfectly breaks down the perception that African Americans do not like/prefer water sports like surfing/swimming . Moreover, the film traces the roots of that myth/truth back to slavery and long-before that.

The fact is, there is record of Central/Western Africans swimming regularly (and even SURFING) as far back as the 15th century.  That's just one of the delicious nuggets of info/facts the film deftly reveals.

The presence of Kelly Slater and Rob Machado in this docu adds credence to the reality that the ""white wash"" of people of color from surfing is noticed by more than just African-American surfers.",1396915200,,716,4.991596638655462
8468250,5,B005EHNXPI,"As a small kid back in the mid 60's, I remember surfing y playing at Inkwell Beach in Santa Monica, Cali.; but you would never venture into as far west towards the SM pier or down south towards Bruce Beach in Manhattan Beach, California, in fear of getting seriously hurt, injured or killed by some ass backward racists white folks...",1377734400,,334,4.583333333333333
8468251,5,B005EHNXPI,"This is an excellent documentary bringing the black experience of it relates to the water, beaches, surfing.  The historical perspective provided helps to answer many of the questions that make you wonder, why more black people do not swim, enjoy the coasts, and surf amongst others.

This is a great watch and I have recommended this to everyone that I feel can develop from this documentary.",1377475200,2,393,4.9393939393939394
8468252,5,B005EHNXPI,I bought this for my daughter since she's an aspiring surfer...we both loved it!  I would highly recommend it...very informative and entertaining!,1327708800,2,146,5.636363636363637
8468253,4,B005EHNXPI,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. Very well written ,It also showed me some things that I did not know about California. Having grown up in so cal and spending time in Newport beach and Huntington Beach,How rare it was to see people of color in the water Boogie boarding and surfing.being Black my self how strange people looked at me when I went to the beach with friends. Very good movie >",1326758400,,395,4.424657534246576
