In the wake of the slasher boom in the late seventies and entire eighties, every one wanted to captalize on the bloody frenzy and it results in atrocities such  as this (history DOES repeat itself).  Not everyone is Dario Argento, John  Carpenter, or George Romero.  It seems some directors like to think they  are.  The acting is laughable and there is no conceivable plot.  I won't  give away the ending..if you want to call it that, but believe me, you'll  feel like you just wasted nearly two hours of your life and a few bucks  that could have been put to much better use.  I can see how the writer  might have thought the ending would be cool, but it seems to me that they  were too lazy or inept to orchestra a better climax.  Dont say i didn't warn  you.",961459200,2,819,4.395973154362416
