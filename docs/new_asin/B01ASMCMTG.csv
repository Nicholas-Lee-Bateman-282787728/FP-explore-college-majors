7608103,5,B01ASMCMTG,"This video is great! Very challenging for new moms, my sister in law just had a baby and has been doing body shred for the past year but had to stop the last month of her pregnancy and she loves this video, the bodyshred was pushing it a little too hard for her post natal, and also good for me, I think it's a great work out even tho I haven't had a baby yet!",1461542400,4,360,3.8133333333333335
7608104,5,B01ASMCMTG,I love Jillian and how she pushes you.  Great for getting back into shape post baby!!,1461456000,3,85,4.3125
7608105,5,B01ASMCMTG,Great for moms just starting to excercise after baby,1461369600,3,52,4.888888888888889
7608106,5,B01ASMCMTG,"I've been a long time fan of Jillian (I'm on my third '30 day shred' DVD) and having had a baby recently, I knew I had to get this DVD. It was a great way to ease back into working out.
It might be too easy for dedicated mamas who worked out all through their pregnancy-I spent about two weeks completing one workout a day then two weeks with two a day, then got back to 30 day shred. I plan on trying this one again when I find my heavier weights!",1460246400,8,448,3.880434782608696
7608107,5,B01ASMCMTG,"This dvd is great for beginners like me! I have not exercised since giving birth to baby no. 1 and having just delivered my no. 3, I'm absolutely out of shape and in need of something simple to start with. Jillian was very encouraging and thoughtful. The workouts were designed for moms that might have C-sec and also kept short to only 20 mins for each section, knowing full well moms with newborns can be very busy and easily distracted by the daily demands.

There are 3 sections of 20 mins each. Upper body, lower body and core. I don't sweat easily but after each workout, I was sweating for more than an hour later. I don't use the weights and also had to follow modifiers (yup, that's how out of shape I am) but I still got a good workout. So this is definitely doable for a beginner or moms who feel they are very out of shape.

This is actually my first Jillian video although I had wanted to try her videos for a very long time already. I'm glad she did this one and just right timing for me!",1459728000,22,1002,4.213541666666667
7608108,5,B01ASMCMTG,"I'm not pregnant but am an avid Jillian fan so I bought this anyway.  I feel for the intermediate/advanced person that this would be a good warm-up video.  I will use this one day after I have kids but the non-pregnant athletes can definitely use this as a warm up for upper body, core, and lower body.",1459296000,14,302,4.280701754385965
7608109,5,B01ASMCMTG,I am a big Jillian Michaels fan and have done numerous of her prior exercise DVDs. This is an excellent postpartum exercise DVD. Like her prior DVDs there is someone doing modifications and someone else doing a more advanced version. I found her very encouraging throughout the DVD. I would recommend this to every mother who wants to get back in shape after having a baby. I think this DVD would be a great way to get back in shape and advance on to her more difficult exercise DVDs.,1458259200,18,484,4.449438202247191
7608110,5,B01ASMCMTG,Excellent postpartum video!! I always thoroughly enjoy her videos and this was a perfect way to transition back to working out. I bought 3 videos for after pregnancy and this one was my favorite!!,1515801600,,196,4.794117647058823
7608111,1,B01ASMCMTG,"These workouts are not diastasis recti friendly like the description says. Would be a good program, but I can only do some of the lower body workouts safely with my gap.",1514332800,3,169,4.483870967741935

7608113,5,B01ASMCMTG,"I'm a first time mom and I was struggling with my body post baby. Hubby found this DVD and gave it to me as a gift when our son was 3 months old. I didn't have the courage to try it out until now (6 months post delivery.) I'm so glad I did! The workouts are challenging without being discouraging. And this is the most fun I've ever had with Jillian (we own quite a few of her other regular fitness DVDs.) I highly recommend this to anyone, not just moms! My husband has even tried it and likes the workouts. It's great for anyone who has never worked out regularly or is just getting back into fitness after a long break.",1512432000,,622,4.10655737704918
7608114,5,B01ASMCMTG,I just love Jillian Michaels! It's been several weeks since my c section and I'm finally able to set aside time for this (first time mom).  The work out is challenging but not overwhelming. I was able to get through the workout just fine with a sweat. It feels good to have time just for me and Jillian Michaels even reminds you to keep that in mind.  Definitely recommend :),1512000000,,375,4.3428571428571425
7608115,3,B01ASMCMTG,"Episodes are labeled by incorrectly. I purchased and downloaded episode 3 which is labeled as abs, and it is actually buns and thighs. So I downloaded episode 2 and its abs but labeled as buns and thighs.",1509580800,2,204,4.54054054054054
7608116,5,B01ASMCMTG,"Being an avid Jillian Michael DVD junkie, this was a must have for after my son was born. I have done most of Jillian's DVDs, 30 day shred being my favorite, so I was familiar with most of the moves. Keep in mind that this DVD does not have any HIIT training in it and nothing with impact, which for new mommies is great. I did follow my doctors orders and waited 6 weeks.....but after starting this DVD, I felt I could have starting light work outs a few weeks earlier. This DVD has a good pace to it, not grueling, not intense, but steady with a lot of modified moves. I would definitely recommend it. In fact, my father has a bad back and can't lift weights or do HIIT training - I gave him this DVD and told him to try it out because I didn't think it would be painful to him.....of course, I had to tell him to ignore her repetative reminders about the importance of post baby keegal exercises! HAHAHA!",1507852800,6,907,4.188571428571429
7608117,5,B01ASMCMTG,"I'm a huge fan of Jillian Michaels workout dvds. I've used ripped in 30 to lose my baby weight from my first child and continued to use it when I needed to lose some fat. I love her yoga meltdown it's what hot me into yoga. I also used a few others in between going to the gym to switch things up...now that I've just had my second baby I wanted to get back to working out sooner and bought this DVD for the post partum period. So far I think it's amazing and a great prep workout to transition back into the swing of things.  Low impact, still got my heart pumping and left me sweating. 20 mins is perfect while my baby naps and my 5 yr old has fun doing the exercises with me. Absolutely recommend!",1506211200,,700,4.0359712230215825
7608118,5,B01ASMCMTG,"I am 22 weeks pregnant, so I thought this would be a good modification workout since it for post-delivery mommys. I LOVE it! As a mom of 2 and working full time, I am struggling to find the motivation and energy to make my fitness a daily priority. This 20min. work out (3 different ones) is perfect. I can always find 20min. and it didn't kill me but got me sweaty. ALSO I love that I don't have to jump around (modified jumping jacks and burpees). Its just the right about of physical activity right now!",1505433600,6,506,4.28125
7608119,5,B01ASMCMTG,"This woman....is just amazing. She's kicking my butt and I love her for it. For me it was a little more intense and I wasn't in great shape while pregnant, so I wasn't able to do it at 6 weeks postpartum; I had to do light yoga and Erin O Brien's DVD first.  But now that I'm 4 months postpartum, I can handle it. I love this DVD because it's short and effective, which is a must when you have three little ones in the house.",1504915200,8,425,3.941860465116279

7608123,5,B01ASMCMTG,"I started using these (aside from the ab portion) a few weeks postpartum. I strength trained throughout my entire pregnancy and felt lkk these were the perfect ""ease back into it"" for exercise.
The videos were quick enough to do during the shortest naps and can be modified to meet your needs.
I returned to regular lifting at about 8 weeks postpartum and fit back into my pre-pregnancy jeans/have lost almost 40 lbs at 4 months post.
Love Jillian!",1502236800,4,448,4.6835443037974684
7608124,5,B01ASMCMTG,"Exactly what I expected from Jillian! I used to work out to Jillian tapes before baby(buns and thighs, yoga Inferno, 30 day shred) and felt lost after my c-section as to how to go about losing the baby weight without hurting myself. I was so happy to find this tape! She works you just enough to produce great results without straining or taking up too much time (all segments are 20 minutes each, so it was perfect!). This is another quality exercise tape that I will definitely use for the next baby!",1501632000,6,502,4.467391304347826
7608125,3,B01ASMCMTG,"Feel like it isn't good for diastasis recti as promised on back cover. The woman to watch gets up and off the ground incorrectly and many of the excercises are not appropriate for DR.
If I didn't have that issue I would like it! ! I just had specific wants\needs",1498953600,4,262,4.26
7608126,5,B01ASMCMTG,"This is a perfect workout after having a baby. Jillian is on point, the moves work your muscles, there's no odd movements that she sometimes throws in. After having a baby, you want to get into exercising without doing a lot of intense jumping or heavy lifting, and this fits the bill. It has modifications if you need them, and the workouts are quick and to the point.",1495670400,6,369,4.4411764705882355
7608127,5,B01ASMCMTG,One of my favorite post partum dvds because it appears simple but actually gets your heart pumping and your body sweating nicely.,1495065600,2,129,4.909090909090909
7608128,5,B01ASMCMTG,I am a big JM fan. I was able to exercise up until about half way through my pregnancy. After around 20 weeks swelling and pain caused me to take it easy. So after baby was born it had been quite a while since I'd had a good workout. I had a c-section so I was very conscious of my workouts. JM takes these things in to consideration and modifies her exercises so you can get back in to your workout routine without injuring yourself. I started this DVD about 8 weeks post c-section and used it 5 days a week for about a month until I felt stronger and comfortable enough to start working back towards my old workout routine. This is a great way to get back in to it. It's a good workout but not too challenging as you're probably still recovering and haven't been able to exercise for some time.,1494374400,,796,4.175324675324675
7608129,5,B01ASMCMTG,"Awesome workout for a postpartum mom. The workouts are short -only about 20 minutes each-but she packs a lot into those 20 minutes. At the same time, it doesn't feel frustratingly difficult. She cuts out all the fluff and gets down to the point in order to get as much accomplished in that time as possible, while keeping in mind the needs of new moms who are still healing from child birth. There are modifications for women recovering from c-sections and diastasis recti.just a great workout for getting back into the swing of things.",1490832000,2,536,4.712765957446808
7608130,5,B01ASMCMTG,I love Jillian. As a young new first time mom before I got pregnant I workout but let's be honest not much. I wasn't in great shape but I was always at a health weight. And that's what mattered to new. But when I got prego I gained to much weight in the last 10 weeks and had medical issues with my pregnancy. Fast forward to now. I'm a breastfeeding mama which has caused my eating to be out of control I've been yoyoing weight for months and haven't lost any weight since giving birth. I'm 6 months pp now and have decided it's time to get back into my pregnancy weight for myself my child's health and because I'm getting married in 6 months. I found theses to be very challenging and got my heart rate up when I put forth my full effort. For someone who hates working out and was never an avid fitness person I still found these doable I felt like I really a accomplished a workout and I love that they are short in time and perfect length to do when the baby is napping. Looking forward to keeping these up and will continue to do them until I feeling ready to move on,1489622400,4,1073,4.114285714285714
7608131,4,B01ASMCMTG,The core one is great! The legs and butt are alright too. Didn't really care for the arm section. This is fantastic though for those mommies that have had diastisis recti or a c-section.,1485302400,,186,4.5
7608132,5,B01ASMCMTG,"This is the best workout if you have Diastasis Recti!! Diastasis is becoming a lot more recognized and finally there are solutions. The best part about these workouts is that you can make it more difficult by increasing your weights or by stepping up the pace! I've been doing this since 6wks postpartum, i'm now 4 months and I still get a good burn! About 200 cals!
With Diastasis its very important to heal your abs before going back to your regular workout, so I'll be doing this for a few more months!",1483142400,16,505,4.440860215053763
7608133,4,B01ASMCMTG,"Great workout to use when first starting back into exercise after pregnancy (week 6 for me).  I worked out 4-6 times a week alternating workouts for about 7 weeks and then began my pre-pregancy workout.  It effectively prepared me for a regular workout.  I am by no means doing everything I did before pregnancy (for instance struggling with push-ups still), but it did strengthen me enough to successfully work out on my own.  I give it four stars instead of 5 because it is lacking a ""plan"". There are no recommendations on how often to do this workout or when to stop and move on to regular workouts.",1482105600,2,603,4.555555555555555

7608135,5,B01ASMCMTG,"A low key way to ease back into HIIT and Jillian workouts. I was afraid this would be too difficult. Not the case - very approachable and Jillian is very encouraging. Slow pace.

I am 2.5 weeks post partum, and my doctor said I could resume exercise around 2 to 3 weeks. I worked out every day throughout my pregnancy at about the same pace as this DVD towards the end. I plan on doing these workouts until I feel strong enough to graduate to 30 day shred and other Jillian videos.

If you aren't recovering from pregnancy, I would recommend Jillian's Body Revolution first level workouts. They're easy and the moves are probably more appropriate. :)",1481673600,3,650,4.547008547008547
7608136,5,B01ASMCMTG,"Excellent post-partum workout dvd. Short, easy, no special equipment besides dumbells. Low/no impact.  Jillian is very sweet, caring, considerate, and encouraging (weird, right?!). No teeny tiny women with six pacts eithe...real, strong, women.

7608137,4,B01ASMCMTG,I am a fan of Jillian's videos.  I am a little unsure about this video. It includes planks and other moves that physical therapists and postnatal fitness experts recommend avoiding until after 4 months postpartum or significant improvement to diastasis recti.,1480982400,16,259,5.317073170731708

I'm reasonably fit but I can't keep up with Jillian's more advanced stuff, but this and 'Beginner Shred' are excellent for people my age.

I'm a long time Jillian fan and have always used her videos to keep in my best shape so I was so happy to see she had a new mommy workout.

They are challenging, but not too much. I bought them when my son was 3 months old (he is 5 months now) and I do them all the time.

I like that it's only 20 minutes - I'm lucky to get that long to work out these days. I wish Jillian didn't usie her ""nice, sweet voice"" that I've heard her use in other (beginner) DVDs - I feel a little patronized. Yes, it's less intense that her typical videos but for this particular time in my life it is just right. What sold me on this video is that she modifies for those who have diastasis recti (like me) so I didn't have to worry that I might be further exacerbating my condition.",1473897600,4,635,4.129032258064516

I didn't know the HBHM video existed or I would have started with that DVD first before going on to the 30 Day Shred. But overall I would definitely suggest any mom to do this video! Especially right after having your baby. It will definitely prep your body for more difficult work outs!

I had a c-section so was nervous about getting back into exercise and not sure what I should/shouldn't be doing.  I like that this DVD takes into account the post-natal woman's body and makes good modifications.  I feel challenged but also SAFE doing this.

Before my pregnancy I was in good shape and liked to do other Jillian Michaels DVDs and workouts at the gym.  The style of this is great for me because it has a similar feel but no impact.  I am very out of shape since I basically haven't exercised for 2 years and it is the perfect level of challenge.  I definitely think it will go a long way to building up my strength so I can continue to work on my fitness.

Another great thing about these workouts is although they are all targeted a specific body part (legs, upper body, core) each workout is also a cardio workout (at least if you are not in top shape!) and gets some other body parts in there as well.",1462492800,18,1025,4.2153846153846155
7608158,5,B01ASMCMTG,"Pre-pregnancy, I had tried and loved (just about) all of Jillian's videos. This one is EXCELLENT. It's low-impact incase you've had a c-section or diastasis recti, yet still challenging.

Baby was a lifesaver so I had no doubts this would be beneficial also. If a particular move was too much I just didn't do it until I felt comfortable. I can put my baby on the yoga mat or on top of me while Im doing some of the circuits and that is nice. Havent seen any results yet besides soreness but thats because I do one workout every 10 days or so. Its better than nothing and its there when I need it!,1532044800,,551,3.9285714285714284

8748237,5,B01ASMCMTG,"I adore this DVD. I've exercised my entire life but I've had hip pain off & on for the past 10 years. I picked up this DVD at the Dollar Store and I can't say enough about it. Her cues are incredible. This DVD has helped me realize how WRONG I've been doing so many exercises for years, THUS the hip pain! This will make you sore and STRONG. Can't say enough.

8748240,4,B01ASMCMTG,"I liked this DVD, she is very gentle and considerate on this one, picture quality is good and trainers are relatable. Workouts are similar to those on her other DVDs but lower impact and slower paced. I would recommend this if you are just getting back into working out slowly. I feel that it was a little too gentle for my taste but thats a personal preference.",1519948800,,362,4.417910447761194

(Therefore I had a very sedentary pregnancy) These workouts have been awesome for me, they really challenged me the first few times, after two weeks of these workouts I am able to start pushing myself During the workouts. I cant wait to get back to my other JM workouts.",1518998400,,373,4.5

8748243,2,B01ASMCMTG,"I like be the other Jillian Michaels DVDs but after doing the core one I am so sore in my neck, back and shoulders-not in a good way. I also don't think the core workouts are good for post partum...lots of planks which are not good for diastasis recti.
I haven't tried the other sections yet.",1517788800,,292,4.232142857142857
