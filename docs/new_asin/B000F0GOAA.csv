A car is parked on the highway, Route 487 in Wyoming. The driver prepares for another day (he slept in his car). Michael arrives at a construction site to file a job application. His bad leg disqualifies him. [Insurance regulations?] He stops at a gas station for fuel, and gets a tip on work in Red Rock, the next small town. He walks into a bar, Wayne thinks he is Lyle from Dalla. Wayne advises him to make it look like a simple robbery. You know what to do. Its about Waynes wife. [This fits the pattern.] Lyle learns why Suzanne goes riding! Its an awful lot of money. Love does strange things to people she says, and makes a counter offer. Driving in the rain at night he hit a man in the road! He carries this man to the local hospital ER. This man was shot twice in the stomach! The Sheriff arrives. [Another surprise!] Can they forget about the whole deal? There is another surprise!

The shooting says this is serious business now. Mike gets a ride from a passing car. Is he lucky? This driver offers a beer and a ride to Mike. What a coincidence! Mike escapes from the murderous pair. He has a story to explain his presence, and gets a ride to a ranch. We learn who was shot in the road! [No arms in that rural house?] Lyle hears the running bath water and goes to investigate. Another surprise! The Sheriff asks his Deputies to find the escaped prisoner; no APB. Waynes wife inherited money, her death would make her spouse a rich man. She offers thanks to Michael. [Her Guardian Angel?] Were not in Texas. [Shouldnt they have scooted out of this county and state?] Suzanne has a plan to get the money so they can go to Mexico; Mike agrees. She knows the combination to the safe in the floor. There are papers with the money there. Then Wayne shows up. The Deputies show up with bad news for Wayne. They question Wayne over the shooting of Kirk! [What a lucky brake!] Suzanne offers a deal to Michael. But there is another surprise here.

Lyle returns to a house and warms it up. Then he returns to the Sheriffs Office and starts to bargain with Wayne. They leave for a new destination. Lyle loves his Scotch whiskey, which loosens his tongue and inhibitions. They arrive at a graveyard to dig for buried treasure. Lyle talks to Wayne, fair is fair. Wayne has a trick too. There is a shot, then a fight. Then a call the Sheriff. The fight between Lyle and Wayne is ended by a statue. Suzanne acts against Lyle as well. The sirens in the distance announce the ending, Can they catch a train? Suzanne says its all about the money. Go get it. says Michael. There is an ironic ending to this story of greed.

This story can be criticized for its characters, but this is a lesson about the logical conclusion for various crimes. Some parts may seem implausible, but this is a drama and not a true crime story. You can compare it to the classic crime stories of the 1940s. The obvious lesson is to avoid people with bad characters in your self-interest.",1395014400,,2985,4.372972972972973

8116062,4,B000F0GOAA,I bought this movie for the Buick that featured throughout. I was trilled with the footage. The storyline was ok too. Lara's hairdo was the only part I didn't like.,1347062400,,164,4.5
8116063,5,B000F0GOAA,"RED ROCK WEST,,  starts out kinda slow,  and guessing what happens along the way wasn't on target for me. It had the right actors in the right roles to keep it realistic,  and the ending is GREAT from my point of view.  I don't know how long CAGE worked out before he does his exercises in the movie,, but he actually does them himself, and that isn't easy.  Very entertaining  5 Stars",1320451200,2,385,4.277777777777778
8116064,5,B000F0GOAA,"If you are looking for an egde of your seat thriller movie that takes place in the old west, and where great actors like Nicholas Cage and Dennis Hopper bring a movie from years back that feels and looks like a movie of today's generation then Red Rock West is what you want.",1192320000,2,275,4.2075471698113205
