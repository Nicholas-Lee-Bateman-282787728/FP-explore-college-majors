8131223,3,B000GEFZ5A,"Nowhere on the cover of this dvd does it state ""contains previously released material."" I purchased the Erskine Method"" dvd 2 years ago and was very pleased. When I recently purchased books Vol 2 & 3 of Drumset Essentials I was impressed enough to then buy this dvd. The promo indicated that the dvd was the companion to the books, but its not really. 70% of the footage has already appeared on the previous disc. The extensive series of brush exercises in the book are NOT demonstrated, rather merely referred to in the intro of a couple of performance clips where brushes are used.
Even the useful Afro-Cuban exs. on the dvd are only partially cross-referenced to the book. There are printed charts in the book that are performed in full on dvd and this is one of its main strengths, but the overiding impression is that the dvd was NOT made to complement the book as claimed. It is mostly a re-using of previously recorded footage.
 Peter Erskine is one of my favorite drummers and it breaks my heart to have to criticise a product with his name on it.
There is some very good material inluded here but its presentation is misleading and Alfred Publ. should know better.  My rating is to draw attention to this fact and NOT for the quality of Mr. Erskine's performance.",1230508800,5,1272,4.574561403508772
8131224,5,B000GEFZ5A,I love this DVD. It is inspirational and very informative. I would have liked to see a companion book with transcriptions to help clarify some of his teachings.,1225152000,,160,4.75
8131225,5,B000GEFZ5A,"Peter Erskine clearly demonstrates and discusses drumming for drummers of all skill levels here. I really, really recommend this video. I've been playing drums for over 30 years, and Peter still has a way of kick starting my enthusiasm! For more in depth exercises and analysis, pick up the three books that this DVD is a companion to.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Erskine-Drumset-Essential-Complete/dp/B000GEFZ5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Erskine: Drumset Essential, Complete</a>",1210982400,,539,7.3076923076923075
8131226,3,B000GEFZ5A,"This video is a bit of a mixed bag. The first part is VERY basic, so I suppose that part is ok if you are just beginning to play. From there it gets very complicated, which is fine, but there is very little explanation or 'breaking down' of what is going on. Also, the materials that come with the DVD are lacking. Not even a listing of chapters or a little pull out booklet with some exercises.

This is probably one that had I rented it first, would probably not purchase. Nevertheless, like any of these videos, if you pick up a few new ideas its worth the investment.",1209772800,,571,4.238532110091743
