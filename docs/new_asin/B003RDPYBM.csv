4184448,5,B003RDPYBM,"Lot's of rage and otaku tears surrounded the haruhi franchise when endless 8 was airing.  Nobody could believe they would seriously animate 8 almost identical shows.  Except for me.  I was hoping they would do 8, and to my elation they fulfill my expectations.  Not only that, tho, but each episode had a different mood and feel, slowing becoming more and more hopeless. It was a great experience for me, so this ""season 2"" set will be a first-day purchase from me",1277078400,16,464,4.621951219512195
4184449,5,B003RDPYBM,"I'm glad I watched Endless Eight a long time ago (I'd also already seen Bamboo Rhapsody), but I hadn't seen the rest. I'll probably review it sometime, but the Endless Eight was funny for the first 3 episodes, got a little tedious for the next 3, and I was so excited to see a boring, but comical ending. The rest of the season left me with a sore throat.",1398643200,,355,4.159420289855072
4184450,5,B003RDPYBM,The 2nd season taking place during the 1st season fits in and bring more stuff from the light novel. It's just fantastic for the series.,1389657600,,136,4.48

4184452,5,B003RDPYBM,"From what saw in this season and being a huge Haruhi Suzumiya fan, I was quite satisfied so I give it 4 stars.

Despite what people have said about some of the episodes that has left them rather disappointed, I (personally) found it very engrossing and intense; esp. after figuring out what was missing during the conclusion. Without giving too much info about the season it can get dark and dramatic, depending on how you will react to these scenes.

What I can say is that since they are in highschool, it takes place sometime after the events of the first season so they do move up in their school years; closer to finishing school (something that happens to all of us). That is unless they continue with the story and make Haruhi endlessly repeating their school years but that's another story.

Great purchase and great season. I recommend it.",1382918400,,848,4.64

4184455,4,B003RDPYBM,"This series is by far my favorite anime. The second season captures the spirit and adventure of the first season and stays true to the comedy and drama of Ms. Suzamiya's life. A lot of people have problems with the dreaded Arc 8, I found it interesting and watched it straight thru without ever getting bored as there are subtle changes in each episode (IE clothes are different, the way the lines are delivered are different). It was not as good as the first season in my opinion but carries on with the story and character development.",1366156800,,537,4.546391752577319
4184456,4,B003RDPYBM,"I'll come out and say it: I'm a big Haruhi Suzumiya fan. It's my personal favorite anime, and while it's a bit unorthodox, it's impossible not to love once you really get into it. Season one first aired in 2006 and was the only season for three years, at which point the series re-aired with these new ""season two"" episodes scattered throughout where they belong in the timeline. These episodes are generally unnecessary, considering they all take place within the timeline established in season one. That being said, there is a lot to be gained from the season two episodes.

There are only three unique storylines in these fourteen episodes: the standalone ""Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody,"" the eight-part ""Endless Eight,"" and the five-part ""The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya.""

""Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody"" is ultimately the weakest episode of the season, though it does bring in some cool time skip elements that will only be further complicated by The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. Adult Mikuru Asahina makes her second cameo in the series, and Kyon's encounter with a young Haruhi is great in establishing how Kyon inadvertently inspired Haruhi to go to North High and create the SOS Brigade, as well as finally resolving a puzzling comment Haruhi makes in the very first episode.

""Endless Eight"" begins with a cute episode about the last two weeks of summer break, and what activities the SOS Brigade partakes in. Part 2 begins in exactly the same spot as part 1, but this time both Kyon and the viewer are having serious deja vu. As it turns out, Haruhi has set the world into an endless time loop, dooming everyone to repeat the last two weeks of summer seemingly indefinitely. Oh yeah, and then that episode repeats six times. And no, they didn't just use the same footage over and over. Each episode is newly animated (with different outfits on the characters and slightly changed background details) as well as newly dubbed. It was so hated in Japan during its original airing that Aya Hirano, the Japanese voice of Haruhi Suzumiya, felt the need to publicly apologize for it.

And, by the way, I enjoyed it. Yep, that's right; I actually enjoyed Endless Eight. When I first watched the series I was admittedly outraged at the way Endless Eight was handled, especially considering it was much different in the novel. However, going in to watch it after ordering this DVD, knowing what to expect, I found Endless Eight to be perfectly enjoyable as long as I didn't watch all eight at once. It was surprisingly fun to spot the differences in the arc's visuals and music, but even beyond that, I believe that Endless Eight is important to understanding several points about the series, most notably Yuki Nagato.

It's during the Endless Eight arc that Kyon begins to notice changes in Nagato. She becomes almost bored, and seems to develop something of a personality. This is only fully understood when one watches Endless Eight in its entirety. We, the audience, experienced the dull two week of summer eight times. Nagato experienced it 15000 times, which makes later plot twists, particularly in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, much more logical. It's easy to sympathize with Nagato, who retains memories of nearly 600 years' worth of summer vacation. That is why I believe Endless Eight is important, though I also believe eight episodes is too many and I can understand viewers' frustration--especially considering the amount of wasted potential in season two.

""The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya"" tries to recover from that, and I think it succeeds marvelously. The making of ""The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00"" is both hilarious and entertaining, and reminds of what was so lovable about the first season while maintaining its own unique storyline. These episodes are the true highlights of season two.

At the time of writing, the price on this item is $29.16, down about $35 from the previous price of $64. This is about as good as the price can get on this sort of item (especially considering its rarity and the bonus CD included). Even if the Endless Eights bug you, season two is definitely worth buying for anyone who liked season one. The Sigh arc will be the most enjoyable, and Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody will also be fun--heck, even Endless Eight will be cool if you just skip parts 2-7 and only watch the first and last.

Overall, Haruhi fans can't pass up this item, but more casual fans may not be so easily impressed. 8.0/10",1362700800,,4442,4.850923482849605
4184457,4,B003RDPYBM,"Both seasons are well done and fun to watch. Too many of the 2005 or later are all fan service all the time nonstop this is not, and worth the money to get. There is fan service in just not ever other minute like alot of them. Do not what to say anything about the plot, you can fine a write up some were that will tell you. Did not what to soil it for you.",1352592000,,357,3.710526315789474
4184458,4,B003RDPYBM,"I love this series. That being said there is a major problem with season 2. The endless 8 arc. The SOS Brigade repeats summer vacation thousands of times, b/c Haruhi doesn't want it to end. This arc lasts 8 episodes. You may as well watch Endless 8 episode 1 and Endless 8 episode 8. The only up side to watching them all is getting to enjoy the different outfits the characters wear to the pool. I actually watched them all and was really bored. If you skip most of those episodes you have a good 2nd season. Either way anyone who liked season 1 will like this one as well.

Season 2 takes place in the middle of season 1 chronologically; and so does the movie. So if you've seen the last episode of season 1 that's the end of the anime. In episode 1 of season 2 Kyon and Mikuru go back in time. Kyon helps a middle school aged Haruhi draw lines on the quad of the school. The last part of season 2 is the making of the silly movie they showed at the culture festival.

I expected more than I got from season 2, but it was still fun to watch. And if you're a fan of this show you will probably like it too.",1350259200,2,1107,4.050228310502283

4184461,1,B003RDPYBM,"There was only one episode worth watching in this entire second season. I was really looking forward to a second season with new content and more story development. Instead, the creators decided to troll the viewers with content nobody really needed to see. They spent far too many episodes emphasizing on unimportant events which don't shed light on any part of the story whatsoever. Did anybody really need to see how the Adventures of Mikuru was filmed?",1334448000,,456,4.935064935064935
4184462,3,B003RDPYBM,"Okay this would have been a straight up five star if it were not for the ""endless eight"" portion. basically a little over half of the disk is a series of 8 very similar episodes. Other than that the series as a whole is amazing if not a little hard to watch. The order in which you watch this series as a whole is debatable because of the way the series was broadcasted. It was not originally in chronological order because of the mass amount of filler. Dont get me wrong this is not the naruto or bleach type filler where you just wish they would keep the story going because all of it has nothing to do with the storyline. The filler in this is either question answering side stories or just random Haruhi whims that to say are entertaining would be an understatement. Pretty much you have to figure out whether you want to watch in chronological order or broadcasted order and stick with it and you will be fine. like I said before the only part of the entire series including the movie and first season that failed to me was the endless eight.",1328140800,,1047,4.319796954314721
4184463,2,B003RDPYBM,"Season 2 is COMPLETE BS, they take up like 8 episodes doing a ground hog day storyline and they literally play the same damn episode over and over and over and over just changing like outfits or extremely minor details, can not believe they had the balls to pull that crap, its like for season 2 they didn't even try at all. I loved season 1, season 2 is a total waste of time and money, save yourself some gray hairs and just download the only 4 real episodes from this season.",1323129600,,478,4.206521739130435

4184465,4,B003RDPYBM,"This one is a OK.  But I did not like the first eight episodes, where they were stuck in a repeating story loop and after a while, the story was starting to get boring.  It won't finally to get interesting until the last few episode, when they went back to the beginning to start filming the short program they made together from the first season.  However, I do recommend this one if you are a Haruhi Suzumiya fan.",1319673600,,415,4.294871794871795
4184466,2,B003RDPYBM,"When I watched the first season of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya I instantly fell in love with the show and eagerly watched as many episodes of the show as I could. I was completely invested in the characters which made up the slow plot in my opinion (similar to how in the Death Note anime their seems to be only one important event or plot point that happens per a episode) so I was interested in the second season when it came out.

Words fail me at how much of a disappointment this season was compared to the last one. As other posters have stated the Endless Eight storyline is horrendous. It can easily be compared to the boring and monotonous side quests in RPG's that completists do. Endless Eight is Eight (yes eight) full length episodes dedicated to the SOS brigade being stuck in a never ending time loop. They do the same thing everyday for eight episodes. And I forgot to mention the Endless Eight arc also takes up half the season.

Aside from how horrible that arc was the series at least has a second one. The second arc is about the brigade filming a movie. It's pretty humorous but it in no way eases the pain left from Endless Eight. Another gripe I have with this season is that none of the characters have developed (a problem that most anime suffers from) in fact Haruhi has become more detestable since the last time I saw her.",1318118400,,1356,4.398406374501992
4184467,2,B003RDPYBM,"It has been at least a year, I think, since the second season of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya came out. When I initially heard about it, I knew I wasn't going to buy it as soon as it came out, thought I'd wait a bit for the price to drop. Imagine my surprise when, even after shopping around a LOT more than a year later, it was still clocking in around $45. Well, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya was going to be out soon and I didn't want to be caught out of the loop (bad choice of words, read on to know why), so I bought the second season.

I figured that at that kind of price, either the fanbase is rabid, or reviews about this show's much dreaded eight-parter episode were highly exaggerated.

Now I'm the type of guy who gives an anime a lot of leeway without pointing out all of its flaws, but WOW. Really?

I will give you fair warning right now. After the first episode, a test of patience begins with the episode Endless Eight. Endless Eight is the single greatest FAIL in anime in the last ten years.

To give you an idea of just why this is so terrible, let me give you a frame of reference. Endless Eight is based on a short chapter in the light novel ""The Rampage of Haruhi Suzumiya"". That short story is 30 pages long. This iteration of that story is EIGHT EPISODES LONG.

The first episode is fine, it's just Haruhi and co. doing their thing during the summer break. The second episode is fine too, it shows the exact same things are happening, they realize something is wrong, and this gives a creepy sense of lingering doom. Turns out they are caught out in a time loop and are repeating the past two weeks of summer break over and over again because Haruhi is not content with what they've done so far. And guess what? We get to go along for the ride!

Then they proceed to copy/paste for the next FIVE EPISODES until they get to the eighth episode, at which point they repeat everything ONE LAST TIME before finally solving the problem.

This would be stretching my patience as a three-parter, but as an eight-part episode it is absolutely unforgivable, especially considering the pricetag. That is more than HALF of the second season. And they didn't do it because it would be cheaper, on the contrary. In every episode, there are different shots, the characters wear different clothes, and the voice actors use different tones and inflections on the same lines EIGHT FREAKING TIMES.

WHY?! Just... WHY?! It makes no sense, needlessly costs money, angers the fanbase, and sucks away at more than two hours of your life!

However, the whole set does offer six episodes that are not Endless Eight. Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody and The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya, which is a five parter that shows how episode 0 from the first season came to be. Both are okay entries into the series, but hardly justify the $45 price tag.

Take my advice. Unless you are one of the GREATEST, most HARDCORE and PATIENT of fans, pass this up and spend your money on something that won't eat up hours of your life without providing compensation in the form of genuine entertainment. If they were selling the DVDs in this set one disk at a time, I would absolutely recommend buying the ones that don't have Endless Eight on them.",1315440000,,3228,4.45593220338983
4184468,5,B003RDPYBM,"*no spoilers*  I'm an absolute fan of the series so of course I loved it. And obviously you would need to see the first season first, but if you get the first season don't watch episode 00 until you finish this, because watching that first confuses you, and the last arc in this season is of the SOS Brigade making the movie that's A. Being shown as episode 00, and B. The movie Kyon talks about them showing at the arts festival. This season does contain the endless 8 (episodes 2-9). Note that though the following concept sounds annoying, it is very entertaining. The endless 8 involves their endless summer vacation, now the seemingly annoying part is that all but the first and last episodes, you can expect to be the same, they have slight differences (what they wear,experiences, and some dialog) now the first seeming like a normal episode the last being them ending it, the actual story behind it is that Haruhi, for some reason wants to see summer last forever, and of course she has no idea, that is when her powers work, and make that happen. Now this is a very enjoyable arc, even though the plot sounds annoying. The last arc in the season being the first episode. This is the bamboo rhapsody, and sheds alot of light on the ""3 years ago"" everyone keeps mentioning. This is a very enjoyable arc in my opinion, and also becomes a VERY key part of the series. Now I realize that I've listed the arcs backwards (the actual order being: 1:The Bamboo Rhapsody, 2-9: The Endless 8, 10-end: The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya (where they make the movie) This set also includes a bonus disk with the full theme for the opening and ending, sung by Aya Hirano, meaning they're awesome if your into that music. This season is VERY necessary to watching the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya (released September 20). This series is based off the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa. This series is also responsible for the spawn of Lucky Star. Which was made solely on the promotion of this series, and about 90% of this series is multiple references to Haruhi, including Cameo appearances by some of the characters.

In short the series is awesome, and any Haruhiist will enjoy it thoroughly.",1314835200,,2183,4.623711340206185

Turnes out they are stuck in a time loop and have been for almost 600 years. Poor Yuki can remember every single day of it.. It turns out what haruhi wanted to do was have a homework party...... 600 years for poor yuki and all she wanted was to hang out and do her homework.

4184472,4,B003RDPYBM,"While the Endless Eight story does get a bit repetitive, you'll notice the subtle differences in each episode (if you pay even the slightest attention) and the eventual conclusion of the storyline. The art is slightly different then the American season 1 but the overall quality is good. You only get 3 major storylines in this season, and after reading the manga, a season 3 and maybe even 4 can be expected. This is a good continuation of the series and while it will draw many displeased fans and haters with the Endless Eight, it is something I'd recommend to true fans of the series who can tell the difference between subtle variations.",1297641600,,642,4.6902654867256635
4184473,1,B003RDPYBM,"I just don't get it, season 1 was great! It had something for everyone, this is like the only anime that literally made me laugh out loud, and on top of that it had amazing action sequences and storyline. Season 2 is putting it VERY lightly ridiculous. It's like if somebody had a time machine and used it just to destroy every good feeling you have ever had in the past. The endless 8 is the WORST way to start a new season. I kept picking up and leaving it from 5 to 8 for the span of a month. By the time I got to the end of the 8 I just dropped all expectations from the rest of the season. Then the other part of the season just destroys the feelings that were built up of Haruhi being this innocent cute girl in the first season, and turn her into a complete b$#$h. This season brings NOTHING to the table, the only interesting part of the season was when mikuru got the power to shoot things with her eye, and even that is excess unneeded information. This season is not worth 50$, i wouldn't even begin to think about it unless it was close to 10$-15$.
Haruhi is still an interesting and fun anime, just disregard this season, and go watch the movie, hell the movie had a MUCH better story arc than this season.",1295136000,9,1219,4.147679324894515
4184474,4,B003RDPYBM,"For those of you who consider purchasing this product, one thing to keep in mind is that these episodes do not take place after the events of the first season. Despite that fact, make sure to watch season one first! It introduces every important character, places them in tough situations, and it was the standalone season for over two years. Season 2 is nothing but a renewal from the antics of its predecessor; nevertheless, it still remains its top notch quality that the first season provided. Personally I do not agree with the aspect of Endless Eight. It's tedious and you would probably get the picture after watching a couple of episodes. If you choose to skip any of those episodes, I would suggest that you watch the first episode of Endless Eight, another one in the middle, and then the last episode to know how it ended! The rest of the episodes are informative, but they prelude to the horrific Episode Zero of Season One. I liked the DVD set because it has many extra features and it includes a short soundtrack that has both the opening and ending themes. So buy or rent? I chose to buy it because I found it for a cheaper price and I am a fan of the first season; otherwise, wait until it gets cheaper!",1290988800,,1219,4.4708520179372195
4184475,2,B003RDPYBM,"Season 2 included ALL episode from season 1, and half of the season 2 new episode are repeating time loop. The time loop story arc did not add any story or character development to the series. It is a waste of time and money, all you have to do is watch first and the last episode in the time loop arc.

I can see hardcore fans enjoy seeing their favorite character in different dress and swimsuit, but for people that love anime for its interesting story will feel betrayed or even scammed.

The other half of the new episodes are amazing. If you loved season 1, there are no reason not to watch season 2. However, overall I am very disappointed that the producer decided to add 70% of meaningless content to justify $60 price tag.

The next Haruhi movie timeline occur between the events in season 2, and about 2 and half hour long (about 5 episode). it really made fans wonder if they cut out those episode and warp it into a movie at the last minute, and fill the missing hole with the meaningless time loop episodes.

Again, I have to point out the new episodes are amazing. You just have to understand your only buying 7 episode here. However, if you never watch season 1 or have a fan that never tried Haruhi, this became an instant 5 Star recommendation.",1289692800,,1262,4.380341880341881
4184476,4,B003RDPYBM,"Hopefully you are already seen my first review of Haruhi Suzumiya. This show is such a blast to watch, but as I had written I was quite surprised how a show with such originality came to a screeching halt with so many unanswered questions. Well here we have season 2! The funny thing I have to say about season two is that it it's not really an official second season yet it does `fill in the gaps' so to speak.

This season takes place in different intervals between the original 14 episodes and that is something that I have grown to love in storytelling. It's very similar to Batman: Under The Red Hood. While giving us an entire epilogue this piece of the story gives us a few gap fillers that turn the original story of Death in the Family into a much deeper story it other pawns in play. So Haruhi does the exact same thing. Now I just want to say that you need to brace yourself for a spoiler alert. This season features the Episodes known as `The Endless 8' Yes you are pretty much going to see the same episode eight times with a few small differences, but it is probably one of the most original ideas to keep a story going and the best part is it will take you a little bit of time trying to figure out why it is happening.

While this season was just as entertaining I am still trying to find out where it is going. If you watch all the episodes in order you are still left with a few more of the same questions. Still, the major question I had was answered and that is that the crazy adventures of the S.O.S. Brigade are not through yet.",1288742400,,1550,4.1806020066889635
4184477,2,B003RDPYBM,"This could have easily been a 4 to 5 star season if not for that Endless 8 arc.  The animation in all episodes is great as was the voice acting I thought.  Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody and The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya are both good.  The Endless 8 arc could have been great too had it not been for the over the top and excessive abuse of the whole time loop concept.

Having character's stuck in a time loop has been done by plenty of other shows and games before, but never rehashed to this degree.  Recognizing the character's are stuck in a time loop and sympathizing with their dilemma is one thing.  Me feeling like I'm stuck in a never ending time loop from watching it is another.  All it would have really taken is 1 episode to let you see it before the dejavu effect.  1 episode of the character's having that dejavu feeling and building up the scenario and then the last episode of the scenario.  Changing a spoken line, changing the tone of voice, changing the characters outfits, placing a funny message in the background or swapping hairstyles from episode to episode... while better than doing nothing for each of the 7 following episodes... is not enough to warrant around 3 hours of nearly identical content.

Comparing it to the movie Groundhog Day is also giving the Endless 8 arc way to much credit.  Groundhog Day, from start to finish, was like 101 minutes long.  The Endless 8 arc is something like 200 minutes long.  In the 101 minutes of Groundhog Day it managed to introduce the characters, go through several extremely varied time loops and then bring the story to a good close.  The character's going into the Endless 8 arc already have an entire season of character development on them and it does not bring the story to a close either.  Yet it is double the entire length of Groundhog Day and has extremely little worthwhile differences between each episode of it.  That is a complete and absolute waste of a person's time, money and truthfully quite ignorant to the fans.  As other people who have pointed out in the other reviews, it wasn't like that in the novels, so why do it here.

So after shelling out the money for this you'll walk away with around a half season of a high quality show.",1288224000,20,2215,4.495

Fortunatly it did end on a sort of high with the making of Episode 00.
The Sigh of arc, it definately had alot of tension which the the other episodes missed and was warmly welcomed.

Overall it was a good 2nd season but after the epic 1st it felt a little disappointing. Heres hoping the Disappearance & Chan DVD releases revitalise the Haruhism :)

4184486,2,B003RDPYBM,"I give the R1 release of the Haruhi season 2 DVD set a 1-star rating. The Japanese audio track is messed up and has only mono audio. Still doesn't sound too bad but a mistake like that these days is unforgivable. The video quality isn't that great either, but it is better than the video quality of the Haruhi season 1 DVDs. No interlacing problems this time around. The bitrate is still very low but at least slightly better than before. The subtitle fonts have changed to match other recent releases.

I give the show itself 3-stars for season 2. A lot of people hated Endless Eight. My take on it lies in the middle. Plot-wise, the concept seems minimally acceptable, but when you actually see what they did, there is no excuse for the bad decision. Every episode is pretty much 100% identical to the others in content. I thought there might be subtle variations in each later episode, but nope. It's exactly the same each time around which is stupid. Also, the time loop didn't occur 8 times, it occurred 15000+ times, so there's no innate reason to make 8 identical episodes.

Animation-wise though, Endless Eight is fine. There are absolutely no rehashed visuals, they drew 8 completely different versions of the same episode. Everyone wears different clothes in each version, and all the scenes and shots are completely different too. They just say and do the exact same things each time. In terms of production value, Endless Eight isn't a rip-off. Still, the overall animation quality of season 2 isn't as high as season 1. Endless Eight needed the 3-minute beach scene in each episode to be longer, at least then there would be a point to watching eight versions of the same thing.

The remaining six episodes are fairly boring, which doesn't help either. The only interesting events in Haruhi season 2 are the few times when Tsuruya or the BB guns are on-screen. Fortunately I only paid $29 for Haruhi season 2 during the big Bandai DVD sale, so I can't complain.",1286496000,6,1974,4.68299711815562
4184487,4,B003RDPYBM,i really do like the series but my only problem is with the endless 8 episodes. it's only 14 episodes long and #2-9 are almost the same episode with a few changes but the other episodes are great it would be great if there was another season coming out.,1286064000,,253,4.183673469387755
4184488,4,B003RDPYBM,"The whole series was not bad at all. As a fan of Haruhi and her comical adventures I really enjoyed watching season 2.

The Endless eight was not as bad as you would think. You get to see all the crazy things Haruhi gets the gang to do and what kind of trouble she causes without even knowing it. To me it was very intresting. Yet, having eight episodes of the same thing over again did get somewhat annoying and boring, and was probably not necessary.  Although it did add to the feeling of being in a never ending time loop....

Overall this was great and, other than those eight episodes, was very entertaining and enjoyable.",1285718400,,628,4.396551724137931

It comes with a CD as well that has the opening and closing songs, which is a nice bonus!
It also has the dub AND the subs, so no worries there. (I'm a dub person myself, actually.)
A must-buy for all Haruhi fans!",1285372800,,301,4.206896551724138
4184490,5,B003RDPYBM,"Let me start off by saying that if you are a fan of Haruhi, you should support the releases and buy this box set.
Here's why:

Endless Eight is a very good concept that was executed perfectly. I am no fan boy, or otaku, and I am not just trying to trick you into buying this set. Endless Eight consists of the same story line drawn in 8 different episodes, giving a fresh perspective every time you advance an episode.

I found myself intrigued with Endless Eight because it is the only way to offer the viewer the feeling of being trapped in a never ending cycle. It adds much depth and was a bold and creative move.

I am sure that most viewers who are already fans of Haruhi will find Endless Eight enjoyable.

Do not listen to these jaded hardcore otaku, who, in my humble opinion, demand way too much!
Don't let their words deceive you. They are angry because Kyoto Animation did not cater to their personal needs(go figure). Don't go into watching the series thinking, ""Okay i'm ready for endless eight, everyone said this sucked so i'm just gonna watch it(with a closed mind) and skip to the next episode.""

If you like unique, innovative anime, then you already know why you watch Haruhi to begin with!

This season is not as good as the first but it is definitely worth buying!
The first episode, ""Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody,"" is such a trippy episode that I had to re-watch it to make sure I got everything!

The other episodes deal with the making of the adventures of mikuru asahina, the movie. Did I mention that Bandai has thrown in an insane amount of dvd extras? I mean, not many companies do that anymore. If you want extra content, this dvd will not disappoint!

I'm not trying to pick a fight with the angry fans but they post their angry rants as reviews and therefore scare away potential fans of the second season!

Even comes with a nifty CD, for people who enjoy the opening and closer songs.

p.s. That price tag is expensive, I'm not gonna lie, try to find a good price. And with that, I send you on your way! Go on, get'!",1285113600,6,2042,4.378306878306878
4184491,1,B003RDPYBM,"To begin, let me get something out of the way. I'm a avid fan to the series. I have reading the light novels, I watched Seasons 1 and 2 as they aired from Japan, and I even buy the manga; please some kind manga company release The Vanishment of Nagato Yuki-chan. I really love the source material, the characters, and the universe itself. Unfortunately, now, I need to get on to the unpleasant business at hand. ""Season 2"", actually the second part of Japan's season 1, is absolutely dreadful and left me in a state of absolute horror.

How is that possible, for a long time fan, and supporter of this franchise to say such? It's quite simple my friends, let me explain. The first episode of the series, Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody was an absolute brilliant start and had me in intense high hopes that my wait would pay off. I wish I could say that BLRs quality and excellence of storytelling was indicative of the rest of the season. Unfortunately, my hopes were to be smashed quicker than Britney Spears first marriage. I was introduced to the absolute terror that was Endless Eight.

Most people are familiar with the film Groundhogs Day, i'd hope? If not, go out and buy it; because a DVD of that is bound to be more entertaining and cause you less pain than Endless Eight does. The concept is exactly the same, where Kyon is stuck in a time loop where he relives the same events over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Kyoto Animation, trying to be cunning like with their out of order broadcast of the first season, created a monster that lives you in despair; there's really no other word for it.

Each episode play out slightly different, with characters having different outfits and with the camera angles being different on scenes. However, the content of the episode remains exactly the same, and plays out a total of eight times; easily proving to be the greatest waste of animation, time, and budget since Delgo. Kyoto Animation played on peoples hopes of even getting more episodes of this series, JUST to spend the majority of the season on repeating the same content 8 times.

The remaining episodes of the season, which is the five episode story arc called The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya. Unfortunately, for individuals like me who read the light novel, said story is easily the weakest Haruhi story to date. For those that watched season 1, you'll remember the quirky ""first episode"" entitled The Adventures of Asahina Mikuru Episode 00. This story is the filming and creation of the SOS-dan's film, which unfortunately means in a lot of ways it's a retelling of that episode. So, when you add it all up? 13 episodes of the season are basically not new material, leaving Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody to be the only real new episode in ""season 2"".

That's it, just one single episode out of a 14 episode boxset. This then brings us to the point of the MSRP of this set, for 14 episodes they want to charge 65 dollars; brought down to 61, by Amazon. If this season had been fantastic, with 100 percent new content sure I can imagine there'd be no hesitation to buy this set. However, you are going to be spending about 37 dollars JUST on Endless Eight. Yes, you are throwing away nearly 40 dollars to see the same content 8 times. In turn, you'll be spending 23 dollars on Sigh; which as I pointed out earlier isn't truly new content either.

Do yourself a favor, and save yourself that money. Use it instead to buy the hard cover versions of the light novels that are currently available on Amazon. You can also take the remaining money, and invest in some of Funimation's new S.A.V.E anime boxsets. My personal recommendation is you invest in Kanon, and AIR; two series that were both animated by Kyoto Animation and are equal or greater quality to Suzumiya Haruhi.

I'm begging you, if you like this franchise don't give it any money. Bandai doesn't deserve to make any money off of Endless Eight, and let's be realistic are you really going to want to rewatch this boxset after you buy it?",1284940800,15,4026,4.560165975103734
4184492,2,B003RDPYBM,"Haruhi Suzumiya is a great series, but this season is not worth a price tag of 60 dollars. To begin this season only contains 14 episodes which is on the short side of an anime. Add in the fact that 8 of these 14 episodes are essentially the same exact episode with different clothing on the characters, and you have 6 episodes of a good anime coming to 10 dollars an episode. Now I don't know how you value entertainment, but 10 dollars for 24 minutes of fun is not a good buy in my opinion. Stay away till a decent price drop.",1284768000,3,528,4.135922330097087
4184493,5,B003RDPYBM,"Here is the thing.... i get what they were trying to do on the first 2 discs aka the episodes on them but the fact that you can literally watch 2-3 episodes on the first disc then skip the 2nd disk and pick up on the 3rd and miss nothing... is a bit scary.  Thing is, i think this is because we had to deal with movies like The Butterfly effect and ground hog day.  Now i did like how in every episode it was drawn in a slightly different view and the dialog would change.  I think they really could of atleast made reference to some of the other stuff that was supposedly happening during some of the other 15531 times.

On the other hand if you watch it all the way through in one setting you will really feel like you had a major deja vu and probably have a weird feeling in the back of your head for a few hours.  The makes of this had huge shoes to fill though with how much expectation was surrounding the release so maybe this was just to numb us back down to reality and get us leveled out on the series ha.

Sorry if you didn't catch that pre-order price, if u did congrats on saving some money.  Will probably go down eventually but I wouldn't expect it to for a while.  So if you see it under $50 somewhere u'd probably better snatch it up.

4184496,2,B003RDPYBM,"The set of Blu-rays have had very good sales in Japan, no matter how much those otakus complained about it. Those same otakus still went out and bought it. Those set of Blu-rays are about $110. So, in Japan, fanservice still trumps creativity and plot.

(Oh yeah, they did this as making Disappearance as a movie would make unimaginable amounts of money. After that plan, all they needed to do was to air the episodes in between, but they were not long enough for 13 episodes. Endless Eight filled that hole.)

Disappearance has made 200 million yen and has been at Japan's top 10 list of movies for a while. Fans love it so much that they keep coming to see it, even though they've seen it about 6-100 times. I'm not kidding. It's still going strong. Kyoto Animation will probably do this for the next smash hit.

And if you do buy this complete box, it would hurt you not a bit to JUMP episode 3 to 9 for those are the WORST FUBARed up part of any series to print in the History of media -outside of the Prisoner show-. The Original series director nixed the idea for the First season and sadly he wasn't working for kyoto animation by the second season to stop it from happening again!

nuanced? majestic and beautiful? more like Nausea inducing rage that had to be endured when viewing. What could of been done in TWO episodes dragged out for almost NINE! It may of dubbed ""endless eight"" as in eight episodes, but half of episode 2 began this mess. The first tightly weaved and ""majestic"" episode neatly tied together many moments out of the first season. All in ONE episode! The ones following the abominable ""endless eight"" did as well, but sadly. That meant the story really never went forward narratively. The company pushed it further with a movie after the second season, but by the end of it. The Blatant retard that is kyon became too much to bare.

The show yet again is wonderfully animated outside of the Hanna Barbara styled ""endless eight"" with rehashed shots, so that should be the Only real reason to purchase this 2nd season.",1282176000,2,1300,4.547008547008547
4184501,3,B003RDPYBM,the endless eight story arc really makes the price for the second season seem way to much. that story arc should have been done in two passes instead of eight. you are paying for 6 original episodes with 6 filler episodes. the manga did the endless eight arc in just 2 passes.$45 for this is just as stupid as those 6 episodes.,1281571200,2,327,4.290322580645161
4184502,5,B003RDPYBM,"Endless Eight is indeed a masterpiece.  I noticed the same things our fellow reviewer did: how the creators played around with the different iterations of the loop.  It's particularly awesome how they play with the repetitions for the sake of humor.  Sometimes the characters assume convoluted poses for the sake of being dramatic and deliver their lines differently for each episode.  On one of the last episodes of Endless Eight, Asahina Mikuru even unintelligibly babbles her lines at one point, clearly playing with the fact that we will know what she's saying even if we do not understand it.

I will admit that Endless Eight is one of those things where people either ""get it"" or ""don't get it"".  It is true that the same resources invested in Endless Eight could have been used for other purposes.  However, the same people that cry over Endless Eight are the same people that complain about lack of innovation in anime.  Yet once innovative storytelling and character development hit them squarely in the face, they go on a rampage about how the creators didn't respect fans' insatiable desire for clichs.

What Kyoto animation has achieved with the Endless Eight arc (as they also did with the non-chronological airing of the first season) is an anime series that constantly defies expectations and surprises you in countless ways, shattering conventions and shunning clichs.  I know another series that did that.  Maybe other people have heard of it?  It's called Evangelion.

Aside from Endless Eight, this season includes the animated adaptation of the novel ""The Sigh of Suzumiya Haruhi"" (available in English from Little Brown Press).  I had read the novel before watching the adaptation, and I can say the adaptation is amazing.  The climax of the story is a showcase of storyboarding and art directing genius that elevates the original scene from the novel to a truly awe-inspiring moment.

This season contains the infamous Endless Eight storyline, an egregious abuse of the fans. What was a few pages in the original light novels has been expanded into an eight episode abomination that would test the patience of even a Saint.
This might have been tolerable, save for the fact that it takes up over half the season, when there were so many more stories from the novels that could have been incorporated.

For this travesty, this plague among anime, I will not waste my money investing in Season 2 of Haruhi.

4184505,3,B003RDPYBM,"After the enormous success of the 1st season of Haruhi Suzumiya many including myself couldn't wait for the second season. But unfortunately fans would be waiting for 3 years for the second season.  Was it worth the wait?  That's up to you to decide.

If you are not familiar with the series or read the novels you must keep in mind that the 2nd season is intertwined with the 1st season.  So some of the story lines in the 2nd season will shed light on a few things that happened in the 1st season.

By now many have heard about the infamous Endless Eight arc in the second season but let's put that aside for now. The season starts off with Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, which is a very important episode and storyline in the Haruhi Saga.  It's the first time we get to see Mikuru use her time traveling powers as she and Kyon must travel back in time 3 years.  After they accomplish their mission the duo find that they are stranded and must find a way back home, which they do in a very interesting way.

Next is the Endless Eight storyline.  Love it or hate it, E8 is a very important arc in the series.  The SoS Brigade get stuck in a timeloop during their summer vacation and Kyon must figure out why Haruhi doesn't want their summer vacation to end.

The E8 arc is told in 8 episodes that are essentially the same but slightly different in tone, acting & mood.  E8 also sees the growth of two characters, Nagato seems to be developing emotions & Kyon takes a step forward to being an active member of the SoS Brigade instead of a bystander.

The remaining episodes are dedicated to the Sigh arc, which is the making of the movie from the 1st season.  You will find out why Nagato tackled Mikuru, why the cat started talking, what's the deal with Mikuru's different colored eyes & ultimately who put it all together!!

It is during these last few episodes that provide the darkest moments in the series to date.  Kyon & Haruhi have a epic confrontation over, ""creative differences"" that threatens the world.  Of course it is up to Kyon once again to find a way to tame Haruhi and put things back in order.

The animation is top notch once again, especially during the darker moments of the series.  There is great dramatic lighting during the Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, the night scenes of E8 and during the confrontation in Sigh.

The music is not as memorable as 1st season but Superdriver (the opening song) and Tomare (the ending song which means Stop) are energetic & catchy enough to be heard & watched over and over.  I found the best score part to be at the resolution of the E8 arc.

I look forward to the English dub of the 2nd season.  I am very curious as to how Wendee Lee, Crispin Freeman & Michelle Ruff will handle the E8 arc and the confrontation. Of course the Japanese va's are excellent as well.

In the end I wanted to really love the 2nd season of Haruhi, but I was found wanting a better effort from the stories.  Personally, I felt the E8 arc should've been two episodes.  I would've like to have seen a more fleshed out Sigh arc because it felt rushed.  Then I really would've liked to have seen a set up of the Disappearance storyline.",1278288000,38,3155,4.376288659793815
