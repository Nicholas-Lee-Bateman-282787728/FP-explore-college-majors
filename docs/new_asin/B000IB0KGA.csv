8337497,5,B000IB0KGA,"We bought this DvD for our son who started drumming on everything and anything within reach when he was 18 months old. He's now 26 months, and enjoys watching the DvD while playing on his kid-size but fully operational drum kit. You need a standard five piece kit plus hi-hat and ride cymbal to follow Colin's patterns, and could add a couple of crash cymbals if desired.

I've started a little drum practise myself, and this DvD will take a while to master. This starts off with co-ordinating your two hands and right foot to do three different things, and adds the left foot on the hi-hat pedal before too long.",1402790400,,613,4.5225225225225225
