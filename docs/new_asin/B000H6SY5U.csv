2629531,5,B000H6SY5U,"The newest entry in the Veggie Tales series teaches us to trust God with two stories about His faithfulness.

First up is the story of George Mueller (Archibald Asparagus).  This real man trusted God to provide everything for the orphanages he ran.  This is the short segment of the DVD, and the focus is on the famous story of the morning the orphanage ran out of food.  Mr. Mueller still had the kids sit down for breakfast, thanked God for the food, and then there was a knock at the door....

The main segment is the Biblical story of Gideon (Larry the Cucumber).  He's more comfortable marching in a band then leading anything.  Still, God calls him to defeat the invading army of pickles with no weapons and the smallest army you ever saw.  Is Gideon crazy?  Or will God do what He says He will do?

I don't know how the guys at Big Idea do it, but this is yet another DVD that kids and parents alike will love.  The message is clear and the stories are entertaining.  The first segment could have been a little funnier, but the main feature more then makes up for it.  I laughed multiple times at the jokes inserted into the familiar story of Gideon.

Adding to the fun, the Pirates have become bored from doing nothing, so they try to host the show.  That leaves Bob free to do a silly song written by the French Peas.  All is going well with ""Ukulele Karaoke"" until the words get shredded by a fan.  Then the fun really starts.

This is yet another strong entry in the fun franchise.  Whether this is your first or not, you'll be sure to be entertained and challenged by the stories here.",1162857600,26,1597,4.352542372881356
2629532,4,B000H6SY5U,"In this episode of VeggieTales, Bob finds that Larry has assisted The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything in taking over the show.  They've discovered that doing nothing gets really boring and are ready to actually start doing something.  After much pleading, Bob finally acquiesces, and the Pirates tell a short story about George Muller, a man who trusted in God for everything and started several orphanages.  The Pirates believe the show to be finished, but Larry reminds them that normally they have a Silly Song followed by another story.  At first no one has a song, but then the French Peas appear with a tune they've been working on for some time.  They take over the ""2nd Set"" and recruit Bob into singing a song with some dancing ""turtles"" in a segment called ""Karaoke Ukulele With Bob"".  After this impromptu gig, the feature story begins:  the tale of Gideon.  In the VeggieTale version, Gideon is a tuba-playing marching band member who plays marching and pep music for his younger brothers' football team.  An angel of the Lord appears to Gideon and tells him God has chosen him to lead the Israelite army (which doesn't exist) into battle against the invading Midianites.  The story of how Gideon testing of God, the selection of the army, and how God uses the Israelites to defeat the Midianites is pretty much intact, but altered slightly with some VeggieTale humor (for instance, instead of drinking water, Gideon's army drinks slushies instead).  At the end of the episode Bob congratulates the Pirates on a job well done, but then is informed by Pa Grape that they have bigger plans: starring in a movie of their own.  This is the beginning of the buildup of the buzz for the planned 2008 release of a Pirates Who Don't Do Anything motion picture.

GIDEON TUBA WARRIOR comes off as pretty standard VeggieTales' fare.  Except for the Pirates hijacking the show and having Bob sing an unplanned karaoke song, the episode stays close to the VeggieTale format.  I played in the marching band in high school and I enjoyed that take on the tale of Gideon--strange as it seems it fits perfectly into the stories of the humble Israelite warrior.  Kids will enjoy watching this episode as well as fans of the series.  It's not the best VeggieTale, but it is a good one.",1161734400,18,2275,4.733502538071066

They have cute songs, a great story, and a moral with every episode. We LOVE Veggietales.  There is an abundance of ""children"" shows these days that I would not let my child watch. It is refreshing to have TV and movies that can actually make you feel good about letting your child watch TV.",1168300800,,467,4.247191011235955
2629802,5,B000H6SY5U,Now here is a great story that can really help to learn to trust God. The story of George Mueller talks about a true story about this great man who trusted God for everything. He never gave up and he never lost faith. Gideon is an awesome story as well. One good and great part of the story is that we learn that God never lets us down and we can trust him with the outcome. The karaoke with bob was also a wonderful treat. This is a Veggietales story that will delight the hearts of children and their families for a long time.,1166486400,7,528,4.086538461538462
2629803,4,B000H6SY5U,"With shrewed use of humor and witty remarks, the folks at Bigdea have done it again!

Falling below ""Duke and the Great Pie War"" and above ""Sheerluck Holmes and the Golden Ruler"" in the rankings, ""Gideon Tuba Warrior"" is a movie worth seeing at least once.

The first segment was disappointing, having almost no humerous areas, but still telling effectively the story of George Mueller's faith in God. However, the Silly Song (done by Bob!) brought a sense of much-needed humor to the movie, and by the time the main story was finished, I was ready to give it four stars. Still not up to par, but better than some of their latest work.
