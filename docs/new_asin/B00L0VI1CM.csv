8662998,5,B00L0VI1CM,"This DVD set makes for a great addition to my Holmesian collection. It comes with everything as advertised (of course) and, really, I can't do the collection justice. One of the earlier commenters complained about bad prints--that's true, but I'm not bothered by it. Many people today are spoiled by the digital age, expecting the old to be in just as good condition as the new. Yes, the bad prints are a bit of a flaw, but it's history and it reminds you of how others experienced these programs.

The only true thing this collection has going against it is the literature that accompanies it. The case comes with a pamphlet of ""A Scandal in Bohemia,"" but instead of tucking the pamphlet into a pocket they glued the back of the book to the DVD case. The case opens up into four sections, and if you want to read that story, you have to do so with the case in your lap--you're better off just buying a Complete Works collection of the Sherlock Holmes stories.

One major point: The page above shows that the collection is currently being sold for $74.70. Don't waste your money like that; I got this collection at Walmart for $20.",1458432000,,1131,4.512195121951219
