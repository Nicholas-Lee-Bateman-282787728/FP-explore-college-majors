If you look at the right one of the two excerpts included with this item's description under the heading: Related Video Shorts, you will see that the right one is the more recent (color version) of two dramas.  This is the movie I hoped to get.  I noticed that there were three DVDs in the box, and I assumed (here was my mistake) that the box included both of these two movies with possibly a third movie or commentaries on the third disk.  I happily ordered the set.  When I received my order, I discovered that the contents were three different History Channel productions about forensic science cases... not what I was trying to get!  The inclusion of the two ""Related Video Shorts"" is highly deceptive in my opinion.  On the other hand, I should have looked more closely at the picture of the box which has the red ""H"" of the History Channel on the lower left corner.  I am not planning to return this item, but I do not mind sharing my frustration with the misdirection on this page.  Caviat emptor (buyer beware)!",1469750400,,1167,4.411214953271028
