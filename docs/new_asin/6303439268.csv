7846607,5,6303439268,"Both of my children love this video; the combination of vehicles and music makes it irresistible.  As the parent, I still find it charming even after a gazillion viewings; I particularly like Bertha with the construction vehicles (""reminds me of a pig I know"").  It's too bad that this hasn't been re-released on DVD; I'd gladly buy it if it were.",1336262400,,347,4.672131147540983

7846609,5,6303439268,My 2 yr old has a tractor fetish.  Any kind any type any anything to do with tractors.  He loves Jack hammer rap from the video.  Our copy gotten eaten by an old VCR and I am trying to replace it but can't find another.  Bummer!  It is worth the trouble of looking for it!! It covers all types of transportation and only the Muppets (Kermit actually) can do it with so much fun for the kids!,1010448000,2,391,4.025974025974026
7846610,5,6303439268,We have borrowed this tape from our local library at least 10 times and my 3 year-old son goes CRAZY for it!  I've even caught my husband humming the songs - even when we're not watching the tape.  Now my son can name the different types of trucks we see while we're in the car.  I highly recommend this tape to the parents of any pre-schooler (good luck finding it!).,981676800,9,368,4.228571428571429
