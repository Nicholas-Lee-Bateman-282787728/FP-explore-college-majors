8135325,5,B000GYT1ZA,"This Karen Wheaton VHS tape contains the Music Videos for the following songs:

Resurrection Here

Gentle Breeze

If Its For Your Glory

Lift Him Up

Feet

Promise Land

Build A Bridge

Miracle In Motion

Jesus Saves

Whatever It Takes

In addition, interview footage with Karen is seen after each music video. For example, after the first song, Karen will come on for about 30 seconds and say a little something. The interview segments are almost exactly as if Karen were in your home personally talking to you. She says a lot of interesting things, such as how she met her 1st husband, DeWayne, her faith, and so on.

Just so you know, this is NOT a Concert...they are music videos which were filmed in studio settings, street/sidewalk settings, concert settings (though no audience is present) and so on. Considering that these music videos are not being shown anymore and that this VHS tape is OUT OF PRINT, I would highly recommend buying this item. If you've listned to this album on CD, there is no comparison when you watch these videos because the songs practically come to life! Karen looks amazing (as always), has an awesome voice, and is out there to spread the word of God. Get this video!!!",1160524800,,1205,4.685714285714286
