7826628,5,6302468175,"I originally saw this video on public television several years ago and have wanted to purchase it but didn't find it until now through your web page.
I am a classical pianist and of Russian descent so  this video  proved to be one of the best I have ever seen.  It is filled with beautiful  music and heart-wrenching emotion.",961113600,5,325,4.4576271186440675
7826629,5,6302468175,"I first saw this documentary on public television in Houston (and have since bought it).  They had scheduled it for the Christmas to New Years break one year as filler.  How wrong they were.  The privilege of  accompanying Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya on their return to their  homeland is only the surface glory of this work.  Works in rehearsal or  used as background include: Barber's Adagio for Strings, Dvorak's Cello  Concerto, Grieg's Asa's Death, Puccini's Mme. Butterfly, Prokofiev's 5th,  Rachmaninov's Vocalise, Shostakovich's 8th and 5th  (finale conducted as  marked, at the slower tempo), and Tchaikovsky's 6th.  The focus includes a  very Slavic welcoming party for the Rostropovich's, return to their homes  and the Bolshoi, footage on their support of Solzhenitsyn and their  subsequent exile, a return to Sokolov's grave, and various TV and newspaper  interviews.  If you are interested in the course and culture of 20th  century music, there are few more powerful investments you can make for 90  minutes of entertainment and information.  These are very real people whose  music is of vital importance to themselves and to the societies they live  in.",950745600,14,1172,5.2896174863387975
