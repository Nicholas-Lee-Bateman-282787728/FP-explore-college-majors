8523332,3,B007Z9KLEO,"This film is set in contemporary Belgrade, Serbia and is about a young, gifted, maths student called Novica (Nikola Rakocevic). Despite a promising career and even a scholarship he starts to see more and more of his neo Nazi friends who go around lending out copies of Mein Kampf and being as racist as possible although some of it is over enthusiastic xenophobia especially concerning Albania if we are being objective.

They do not limit their hatred just there they also hate Jews, gays and Croats to name but a few. They also like Oi music and the uniform clothing of all skinheads everywhere right down to the Doc Marten boots. Meanwhile their antics start to get a bit more law breaking in evidence and the police are  about as much use as a placebo on a cancer patient. But all is not what it seems as the layers of intrigue are removed the true nature of who controls what in Serbian society is revealed.

Now this is actually a really good film, easily four stars, however, I can not stand dubbing and it was such a lame effort that it nearly ruined my enjoyment hence my rating of the product not the film itself. I would have much rather been given the option of watching with sub titles and what annoys even more is that they have put on optional sub titles in both English and German, if only they had have just left the sound track in place.

So well acted, believable gritty in the true sense of the word and unusual in that we have a seriously well conceived skinhead film that is not just about the violence but the thought process that gives birth to hatred too. Lots or racism and more swearing than a Dockers convention, but with dubbing reminiscent of seventies Kung Fu, so if you can swallow that for the actual film then you should get a lot out of this well made effort from Serbia.",1361923200,,1806,4.414414414414415
