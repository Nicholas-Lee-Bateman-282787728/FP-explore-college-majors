574210,5,630315266X,"This is the classic Claymation Christmas. Unfortunately, the manufacturer used the cheaper mode of duplication...EP Mode. For the viewer, that means tracking problems and poor picture and audio quality.
Recommended--This has been newly reissued in VHS and DVD. In addition to Claymation Christmas, both include the other Claymation holiday specials, Comedy of Horrors (Halloween) and Claymation Easter. And the VHS version is now released in the best video quality SP Mode.",1067299200,5,473,5.676056338028169
574211,5,630315266X,"This is a must have for anyone with kids, or who is still a kid at heart.  The claymation technique is unique and versatile, the music is wonderful (the camels are my favorite), and the joyous feel to the pieces make it well worth your 24 minutes.

""Joy to the World"", done soul style, is a truly amazing piece -- it's hard to believe THAT was done with clay.

If you love animation, if you love rampant silliness, if you love the spirit of the holidays, this is one you should have in your collection.  It's finally been released to DVD, and I grabbed it, plus a copy for my sister -- the DVD also contains claymation specials on Easter and Halloween, but this one is by far the best segment.  Pour some eggnog, grab some gingerbread, and enjoy!",1046822400,,746,4.338129496402877
574212,5,630315266X,"I am so glad to have a copy of Claymation Christmas.  Why the networks don't show this at Christmastime anymore is beyond me.  It is so well done, and delightful each time we watch it.  Would like to see more videos from Will Vinton's Studio!",1043452800,2,242,4.333333333333333
574213,5,630315266X,"This is my favorite Christmas special of all time. Vinton interprets a number of classic Christmas carols, using humor and the magic of clay stop motion. The musical arrangements are pleasing, the animation is spectacular, and the humor is enjoyable (I suppose not everyone would find the wise men's camels joining in the chorus of ""We Three Kings"" funny, but I do).",1040515200,,366,4.919354838709677
574214,5,630315266X,"Oh my goodness!  I'm so glad to have stumbled across this tape!  We have an ancient VHS, complete with vintage commercials, which we have watched every year since it first came on.  It's a tradition!  I love the do-wop camels, the skating walruses, and the crazy bell with a fly swatter!  This video is definitely worth owning, even at a rather exorbitant price.",1040169600,,362,4.682539682539683
574215,5,630315266X,"my sibs and i watched this show when we were kids and recorded it.  we still watch it every year and love it.  two dinosaurs host a show about traditional Christmas songs with humerous skits with camels, penguins, bells, etc.  so great!  i totally recomend it to anyone and everyone.",1039824000,,283,4.6
574216,5,630315266X,"I am so excited to finally find this video!  I will never forget watching this on tv when I was younger!  We absolutely loved it.  Recently my husband mentioned that he also watched this as a child and loved it.  We are so disappointed that it's not on television anymore!  This is the probably the best Christmas special I have ever seen!  I love it!  The camels are great!  If you haven't seen it, you at least need to check out the camels!",1039564800,,442,4.240963855421687
574217,5,630315266X,"Claymation Christmas Celebration is one of the best Christmas specials ever produced.  It ranks up there with Rudolph ""the red nosed"" Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman and It's Christmas Charlie Brown.  A great video for the whole family.  VERY FUNNY!  As for the Amazon.com review, I'd like to know what crawled up her Stocking!  Trust me...you and your kids will love it.",1039564800,,368,4.967213114754099
574218,5,630315266X,"Oh well, it was only awarded an Emmy for Outstanding Primetime Animated Show and Best of Category in Broadcast -San Francisco International Film Festival. What do they know, eh Ms. Amazon Editorial Reviewer?
This is a classic for Gen Xer's.  It is as much a part of our nostalgia as the phrase ""And knowing is half the battle..."" (Anyone from Gen X who watched Sat. morning cartoons will know where that came from).  This cartoon was as wacky, strange and one of a kind as we are still today.  No wonder we seek it out and pay mega bucks for it.",1039478400,,545,4.376237623762377
574219,5,630315266X,"My brothers and I watched this the first time it was broadcast and taped it.  We loved it!  Two dinosaurs host the show, which is made up of different claymation characters acting out Christmas songs.  The Carol of the Bells is hilarious with the bells bonking themselves.  I was hoping to buy this for my 3 year old son. I know he would love the singing camels in ""We Three Kings of Orient Are"" and the two dinosaurs.  I can't believe the reviewer at the beginning didn't like it. The songs are catchy and it is just so funny!  I really wish I could get this.  If you get a chance, snap it up.",1038182400,,594,4.157894736842105
574290,4,630315266X,"one of my favorate parts of the Christmas season is all the classic shows and movies, like ""scrooged"", and ""Christmas Vacation."" I have this show on tape back to back with Garfield's Christmas special. We were so lucky to get them both on tape. This is always the first Christmas video we watch every year the Friday after Thanksgiving. Every number in this special is sweet and funny, such as the jazzy camels in ""We three Kings,"" the incompetant bell of ""Carol of the bells"", the ballet walruses in ""Angels we have heard on high"" and the rendetion of ""Joy to the world"" Of coarse, today, with the California Raisens, this show may seem dated, but it is still a enjoyable welcome into the Christmas season at my house",1035504000,,718,4.573643410852713
574291,5,630315266X,I am a 17 year old teen who has loved this movie ever since I laid eyes on it.  I remember the year they stopped showing it on tv.  I was heartbroken.  I had it on tape but not for the vcr we had.  I was and still am amazed that I found this video.  This is an awesome tape along with the comedy of horrors one which I am sure both will be watched to extinction.  It is great for the whole family to sit and watch together.,1034467200,,423,3.696629213483146
574292,4,630315266X,"I saw this on TV when it first came out and loved it. They only broadcast it a few years because the finale featured the California Raisins, whose popularity didn't last very long. The best feature of this video is the version of ""We Three Kings"" with do-wopping camels. And the ongoing joke about wassail is hysterical. Buy it.",1010966400,,328,4.576271186440678
574293,5,630315266X,"We recorded this on a home video YEARS ago.  Our children loved it and played it often.  We have even plajorized it for a church, holiday  fun night. One child decided he'd outgrown it and taped over it one year.  The next year when discovered, he was regretful.  Now all children are grown young adults and want to locate a childhood favorite as do their parents.",1009756800,,364,4.454545454545454
574294,5,630315266X,"I was one of those people who paid $50 to get this Christmas classic. The creativity and originality of this video make it one of my favorites. I hope Will Vinton bypasses the computer animation of today and sticks to his wonderful, if awkward, claymation creatures.",1008547200,,266,4.804347826086956

574298,4,630315266X,"I remember the first time I ever watched this show ....I was 4 years old. Now, after fourteen years, it's tradition to experience the holiday silliness.

574369,5,630315266X,"This is one of the best christmas entertainment videos that I have come across in years. It ought to be run every christmas like many of the other farorites. It's beautifully done and really captures the christmas spirit, and puts you in the mood for the holidays. It's in my library and I really enjoy it every year. I wish Will Vinton would do more of this type of video in the future.",980553600,,387,4.315068493150685
574370,5,630315266X,"The stunning thing about this video is how utterly nuanced the claymation is, how brilliantly vinton's team plays on our expectations for facial expressions.  If this video only had the scenes with Rex & Herb, it would still rank as one of the achievements of animation.  Their repartee is more credible than most live hosts, and their characters are perfectly delineated with a minimum of screen-time.  So now lets talk about the sequences.  ""The simple and lovely Christmas Tree Carol"" is one of the most touching surrealist masterpieces of our century.  ""Angels we have heard on high"" takes a simple comedic shtick, two obese ice skaters who keep bumping into one another and into six hapless penguins, and plays it for laugh after laugh after laugh.  ""Joy!"" is perfect.  My only regret is that the tape is not ten times as long, and that our society spends its resources on defense contractors rather than stipends for Vinton's cultural contributions...  This is now available on dvd!",978134400,4,988,4.945454545454545

574373,2,630315266X,I was very excited to get this video but to my dissapointment it was not what I was expecting.  The video itself is kind of cute but overall it was rather boring. I  was specially surprised at the quality of the video itself.  The picture is fussy as if it was taped in EP instead of standard play.  Overall I was NOT happy with this purchase.,952214400,,343,4.151515151515151

7839265,5,630315266X,"I bought this because I remembered watching the Claymation Christmas special on TV years ago.  It has become as much a part of our Christmas tradition as watching the Charlie Brown Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street, and A Christmas Story.  Not only is the animation great, but the different renditions of the classic Christmas songs are great.",1361404800,,343,5.0

7839268,5,630315266X,"This has been my favorite Christmas Special since the night my sister and I watched it for the first time as kids.  None of the other specials out there have the this type of creativity or the unique take on holiday classics.

""Joy"" is one of the most visually beautiful, touching versions I've ever seen or heard, I'm moved by it every time and find myself singing the song in the car around the holidays.

The Camels and the Bells will have your stomach hurting, from laughing too hard!  My daughter fell for this special like a ton of bricks, and we've been watching it every night since she got it in the mail.  I'm still not tired of it, that's how good it is.",1102896000,7,665,4.288
7839269,5,630315266X,"This is by far one of the most memorable Christmas movies yet.  I have watched this every year since it came out and still laugh. This is the type of movie that someone doesn't forget, like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman.  The Camels are great, as are the Crazy Bells.  Definitely a movie to add to the collection.  Can't wait until it gets put on DVD.  As for the person that reviewed this, they definitely don't have an imagination nor a sense of humor.",1069804800,3,478,4.386363636363637
