8311763,1,B001J2SFKU,"One of the worst war movies ever..! Sound is awful, acting is terrible. Obviously low-budget, but still, no excuse...haven't watched the second feature yet...i cringe at the thought that it takes second billing to this first disaster...oh well..",1462492800,,245,5.473684210526316
8311764,1,B001J2SFKU,"One of a terrible low budget double bill of war stories.  My one star rating is here only to get this evaluation published.  It's actually a ""no rater"".  I bought it only because I had met one of the actors in my father's elderly hotel.  Nice title, though.",1337558400,2,257,4.291666666666667
