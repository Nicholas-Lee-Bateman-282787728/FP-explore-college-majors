8601937,4,B0012DUD3I,"This is a film about Buddhist Thailand, and is centered around Ayutthaya, a city which reached it apogee in the 14th-16th centuries.  All of south-east Asia was ruled or dominated by the Khmers until, in 1258, they were defeated by the Thai princes, who established Ayutthaya as their capital.  The name Ayutthaya was named after the city of Ayodhya in India, the birthplace of Rama in the Ramayana  In the 16th and 17th centuries, Ayutthaya was home to several European embassies.  Later, the Europeans were expelled.  Today, the city is nothing but ruins, having been sacked and destroyed by the Burmese during their 1767 war with Thailand. This powerful city was flourishing when Europe was in the dark ages.  Today, the city consists of ruined Stupas, parts of old walls, streets and alleys and beheaded Buddha statues.  Only one Wat -- which escaped destruction by the Burmese in 1767 -- remains standing in its original form, Wat Na Phra Men.  The nearby city of Lampang was ruled by the eldest son of the king who ruled in Ayuthya, and in Lampang the film shows temples guarded by Naga serpents, bronze Buddha statues dating from 1533 and murals decorated with Jataka tales.  The film then shifts to Si-Satchanalai-Chaliang, named after Krishna's house in the Mahabharata.  There are many shots of ancient stupas, some surrounded with elephants, and spectacular Buddha Statues.  The entire area is so beautiful that it makes one wonder what it must have been like when it was all intact.

""The Road to Chiang-Mai"" is accompanied by a low key voice-over historical narrative.  Unlike some tourist films, there is no gabby tour guide standing at the center of the scene.  This is a low-budget tourist film, and includes shots of local street scenes.  Like the other Flying Monk films, it is a good film for anyone planning a trip to Asia or simply interested in studying the history of Buddhism in Thailand.",1264118400,,1912,4.876160990712075
