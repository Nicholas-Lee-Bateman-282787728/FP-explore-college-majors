As I am in the U.K and that was the postal address it was sent to, I wonder if a little of that rare commodity, common sense could have been used.

8472365,5,B005GVLD5O,"I thought it was a pretty good movie. I really loved how you came to hope that the English would be able to defeat the Normans after all the stuff the main character went through.

But there is one thing that I've NEVER  been able to understand. What the heck is with the regional thing anyway. I just don't really get it. But I really would like to know why the BBC couldn't just make a US region, or other regions for that matter, version of it and charge a few dollars or whatever more for it. I just think it's completely stupid to have a great movie like this only to have it be held back from getting bought by more people by blocking it with something like this regions crap.",1395964800,,682,4.159090909090909
8472366,4,B005GVLD5O,"Interesting video, and certain to inform and entertain those seeking some background knowledge on 1066. Pretty well done, too, in terms of the acting and scenery. That said, it's filled with historical inaccuracies and inattention to detail. Another reviewer commented on how weapons are left on the battlefield after the fight, and that is a good observation, because a good weapon was worth years of earnings and these were typically scooped up by the victors and scavengers before the dead bodies were cold. There are plenty of examples of similar oversight by the writers, throughout the video. There is also some general silliness in the writing. For instance, some Viking dude gives a pre-batte prep talk to his men, along the lines of: cattle die, kinsmen die, but the great deed lives on forever. That poetic phrase is from the Havamal, supposedly the words of the pagan god Odin. Good to see the writers studying the sources and documents, but it'd be a bit like a modern military commander reading a passage from Genesis to his troops to get them pumped for battle - it just doesn't fit the situation. So overall, it's a good video, but perhaps better taken as edutainment than fact.",1389916800,,1193,4.852941176470588
8472367,5,B005GVLD5O,"I have been an enthusiast of English history since I was seven. This movie was fabulous and examines in a thrilling and engaging way the lives and action of ordinary peasants turned warriors and their families.
It really recaptures life in 9th century England and the upheavals, terror and death suffered by the English people during the Norman invasion and the attacks by the Vikings from the North on Yorkshire. A realistic take with no superheroes, just ordinary people trying to survive. but the cinematography , dialogue acting and scenery are all excellent.

So vividly is 19th century England brought to life and so harrowing the atrocities committed by the invading Normans and Vikings invading England.
The perspective is that of the English people. England has a great history and people, and a future worth fighting for.

Mike Bailey captures the young peasant-warrior Tofi, seized from his young wife and drafted into the Saxon fighting force, with panache a combination of youthful callowness and bravery his leading lady Ealfrith is a strong and beautiful Saxon woman played by the highly endearing Kate Ambler. Francis McGee brings force and stamina to the role of the English captain Ordgar.

The cruelty of the Normans and savages of the Vikings captured spot on. The Battle of Stamford Bridge shown in its savagery and intensity and the tragedy at Hastings shows the valour and doom of the English defenders.
But the story of the men and women involved itself is compelling from start to finish.
At a time when English history is being downscaled in schools and universities in order not to offend certain groups, the English children and young people are being robbed of a central part of their heritage and identity. Movies like these can restore the pride and identity of the English people.",1371686400,3,1812,4.993377483443709
8472368,1,B005GVLD5O,"I was not able to play the DVD because it was not the correct region. Apparently I need a DVD player that plays UK DVD's. I understand the video is outstanding, but because of the region I have not been able to watch it.",1362873600,2,220,4.0227272727272725
8472369,4,B005GVLD5O,"If you have serious interest in 11th century history or in campaign strategies, and if you're already familiar with the events of 1066, and if you don't mind dry presentation, this is the dvd for you.

But if the topic is new to you, or if you want an exciting, stimulating DVD, stay clear.

The cover picture promises a dramatic, exciting documentary... but the DVD doesn't deliver. Basically, there are two presenters. The DVD shows one of them standing around, talking. Then the other stands around, talking. Then both sit together on a couch, talking. Repeat.

Occasionally, there's a costumed reenactor standing around, talking.  And for variety, one of the presenters stands next to the reenactor, talking.

What they talk about is interesting... but only if you're seriously interested in 11th century battle strategies. I am, so I was able to enjoy it. For someone else, this DVD might be boring.

The only ""action"" is some reenactors playing at battle... but it's so unrealistic, so half-hearted, so limp, it doesn't resemble any real fighting, let alone an 11th century battle. These are just kids playing, careful not to hit or hurt each other - which is nice for a safe game or the annual school stage performance, but not for a documentary about a battle.

Now and then, there's modern music blaring for several seconds. While Saxons and Normans ""battle"" each other, there's the battle music with instruments which weren't even invented yet in 1066.  That just feels so wrong.

I've mentioned that people with a serious interest in 11th century history or in battle strategies will find this interesting. The facts presented are historically accurate, with emphasis on the decisions made by the leaders (and no regard to the experience of the grunt in the front line). If you're already familiar with the battles of 1066 and want to deepen your knowledge, it's a good DVD.

But don't expect too deep scholarship here. The presenters emphasised that the locations of the battles in the Stamford Bridge vicinity is disputed. I approve of that; few documentaries make this point. So when it came to the Battle of Hastings (the location of which is highly disputed) I was looking forward to the presenters' comments on whether the battle occurred at the assumed place, or at Bulverhythe or one of the other candidates. But they did not even mention that this location is disputed. They just pretended there was only one possible location. In another documentary, this wouldn't have been a problem, but since they made such a big show of discussing the disputed Stamford Bridge locations, this felt wrong.

Summary:
Recommended if you have previous knowledge of the topic and want factual presentation with emphasis on the leader's strategic decisions and semi-scholarly depth.
Not recommended if you want human interest, if you're new to the topic, or if you like convincing reenactment.",1343433600,,2896,5.0
8472370,4,B005GVLD5O,"This documentary takes an interesting approach to history: instead of using modern commentators, diagrams and artifacts, and instead of focusing on theory and on the leaders, it shows what the experience was like for ordinary people.

On the whole, this works well, creating a vibrant, intense, authentic flavour of what it was like to live and fight in England in 1066.

However, there are some problems (these may not be problems for everyone; I'm just mentioning them).

There are a lot of characters. We're supposed to follow not just a dozen individual Saxons, but several Vikings and some Normans as well. I found this confusing.

The Vikings, and even more so the Normans, are portrayed as evil. This bias is inevitable with this approach; when telling the story from the Saxon defenders'  perspective, this necessarily means that the invaders are the hateful enemy.

The ending is cheesy with the couple walking off to a new land to live happily ever after. Maybe some viewers like this.

While the film is historically accurate overall, there are some implausibilities. For instance, after the Battle of Hastings,  the Norman victors leave the Saxon dead lying on the battlefield. This is what historical sources say, and the film shows. But in the film, the Normans also leave the Saxons' weapons lying on the battlefield. No way would this have happened. After a battle, the victors would have grabbed the spoils, especially the weapons! Swords were incredibly valuable in those days; the victors wouldn't have left them behind. And the Normans would not have been so stupid to leave arms and armour behind for Saxon survivors to pick up; that would have meant equipping the Saxons for a rebellion.

In some places, modern political correctness and sensitivities alter the historical flavour. For example, with the introduction of a female butt-kicking warrior (who seems to have picked up miraculous fighting skills without previous training). Fortunately, the makers stopped short of giving the Saxon army the politically-correct ratio of black, Asian, and wheelchair-using warriors.

The action is violent and bloody. This reflects reality, and is well done (not overly gory, but stronger than in other documentaries on the subject). If you can't bear the sight of blood or plan to watch with your children, this is not the DVD to choose.

Fans of The Lord of the Rings will find it interesting to learn that England was called ""Middle Earth"" and the Saxons referred to the Normans as ""Orcs"" - Tolkien drew heavily on history and mythology when creating LOTR. However, other attempts to mix Anglo-Saxon terms with modern English are confusing and jarring, such as referring to women as ""wife-men"" when all other words in the same sentences are modern English.",1342915200,5,2773,5.072527472527472
8472371,4,B005GVLD5O,"I am far from an expert on English history, yet I have been particularly interested in the so called ""Dark Ages"" that go from West Roman's Empire fall to early Middle Ages. ""1066"" represents a movie-documentary mix that addresses three main battles that took place within September of 1066. Two of these battles were fought between ""native"" Anglo-Saxons and Viking raiders in northern England. This is actually a quite interesting aspect as it shows that several raids affected England that year. The last battle is dedicated to Hastings of course in which ""native"" Anglo-Saxons fought French Normans. All the village and armor during battle scenes are a good plus on this feature, to which I should add a very instructive story telling about Norman and Saxon tactic moves (and mistakes) during the Battle of Hastings. Overall, the basic premise of this production is that the viewer will get the view of those who actually fought the battles on foot and those who suffered the most costs (including the simple farmers of slaughtered villages).

I have three points to rise however. It's ok when war and historical movies take the side of those who actually fight the battles. However, these approaches need to be counterbalanced by providing relevant information to the overall political context. With this respect, I think this feature remains short. The motives of Normans, particularly the regular soldiers to join this naval invasion remains very little explained. Of course, some is mentioned about King Harold in terms that he would be an illegitimate King. I would have dedicated 5-10 minutes of the film explaining a bit more about this issue. Secondly, Viking and Norman invasions remain as completely disconnected, except for the fact that some of the defender characters confront both within a short time period. It could be that these different invaders were disconnected, but again, nothing is mentioned about it.

Finally, the tone of the film gives viewers the impression that Anglo-Saxons were the poor, good guys in trouble. However, Anglo-Saxons at that time were already descendants of northern Germany invaders and migrants that took over the mid and southern England land owned by Roman-Celtic inhabitants. This process was initiated by 410 ac approximately, the time in which the British Islands were no longer under the central control of Western Roman Empire, and took several dozens of years. Upon this process, England never was the same, same as after Norman taking over.

Technically, this PAL 2 format remains a good, clear transfer overall. The aspect ratio is widescreen. The feature runs for more than 2 hours. Audio is in English and no subtitles are provided. As extras, you get some nice material, including one about the Tapestry at Bayeux.",1334966400,2,2777,5.125827814569536
