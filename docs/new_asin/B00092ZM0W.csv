2261151,5,B00092ZM0W,I saw them 3 times in the last year. The last 2 times I was drunk so I am buying the video to see what I missed. Lamb of God is my favorite band and great live..Buy this Dvd if you are a LOG fan!,1119052800,,195,3.3555555555555556
2261152,5,B00092ZM0W,"In case some of you don't already know, this is Lamb of God's Killadelphia DVD release. The band filmed two nights of mayhem in Philadelphia along with backstage footage. This DVD will be a welcomed addition to my Live Metal band DVD collection. Right now, I list Slayer's War at the Warfield and Still Reigning as well as Strapping Young Lad's For Those Aboot to Rock DVDs as my current favorites. Kind of interesting that the release date is on the 11th anniversity of serial killer John Wayne Gacy's execution. Back on the subject. Hopefully, this one will be added to that short list of favorites.",1112313600,6,601,4.679245283018868

2261178,5,B00092ZM0W,"I think this is my favorite Lamb of God dvd because it showed the band back in their earlier days,however you can get the As the Palaces Burn dvd that is a bit further back. Killadelphia was the tour after Ashes of the Wake was released. Walk with me in Hell is newer and that is in depth with newer songs you don't get on this set. It is a mix of a live concert in full in Philly and a documentary or filming of the tour(think Chimaira:The Dehumanizing Process or Down:Diary of a Mad Band) but you get the option to play the concert in full and/or the film as it is made,with snippets of documentary inbetween songs. Great in depth interviews with all members,rig rundowns. The live set is great they execute it so well there is a good groove on stage. Performance wise alot of F-U to the crowd between solos or breakdown kinda disrupts it but it is metal show who cares yoi know what your getting into with LOG. You see a song from the Burn the Priest album the song Bloodletting(brutal) as well as 6 songs from Ashes of Wake,4songs from As the Palaces Burn & 4songs from New American Gospel(my favorite album of theirs to this day) The songs are on point John Campbell's bass is so crunchy i love it. Mark Morton tears it up with the solos & riffing and overall attitude he don't seem too worried bout messing up,Chris & Willie work so well together live. The precussion & drum tones are sweet on the concert. My favorites on here execution wise are Laid to Rest,Now You Got Something to die For,Terror&Hubris,Ruin,Omerta,Pariah,Bloodletting(Burn the Priest) Subtle Art of Murder & Persuasion,Black Label and What I've Become. My personal opinion every song is equally as intense and perfectly done it is just Randy and his voice it is impecable and he kills those songs from Priest & New American Gospel. If you are new to LOG check it out you can't go wrong.",1423612800,4,1863,4.4662756598240465

2261203,5,B00092ZM0W,Killadelphia is a awesome DVD. You get to get how touring around the world is and you also get a full concert in a small club.

2261204,5,B00092ZM0W,"I don't own any other Band DVD's but I must say I will probably give them a good look in the future. This DVD was fantastic. It provided some great insight into the lives of the bandmembers while on tour. You get to see first hand what touring is like for better and for much worse...
Footage from a show in Philladelphia with bits of backstage footage and extra footage from the road mixed in between. Very funny at times, but very sobering at others. My hat's off to these guys for putting themselves out there and letting the fans into their personal lives by doing this.
Tons of extras on the DVD also of soundchecks, introductions to the road crew, music videos and more.
I couldn't be happier with this purchase and I will definitely be looking to purchase Lamb of God's other DVD's in the future.
Hope Randy makes it back soon...",1357603200,,836,4.435064935064935

2261211,5,B00092ZM0W,"Killadelphia is a fantastic DVD that captures Lamb of God in 2005 just as they were really breaking into the big time, with a mixture of documentary segments and a sixteen track concert that has a total playtime of almost two hours.
The concert is of very high quality, the band deliver music from New American Gospel in a clear and professional way and give tracks from Ashes of the Wake an energy and rawness that improves them similarly. The band are brilliant performers and know how to command an audiences attention, when to play up to the crowd and also crucially when not to, in order to preserve the spirit of the written songs.
Randy is the type of singer who you may expect might not be able to pull it off live, given the intensity, speed and complexity of what he delivers on record; but in reality his live performances are astounding, if anything better than on record.
Performance is only one quality on which a live concert stands or falls, and thankfully a very strong performance is not the only thing which Killadelphia has to offer, the sound is terrific, with a very clear drum and vocal sound, heavy guitar tones and a good clear mix which gives each instrument a fair chance to shine without sacrificing much in the way of heaviness.
Furthermore, the camera work, direction and editing, in addition to the lighting and stage show are excellent bringing a real excitement to the video without having to resort to cheesy wipes or frequent quick cuts like other concert DVDs sometimes do, but which only ever give the illusion of energy.
On top of all this, the track list is excellent with tracks from each of the band's early albums together and performed to the highest quality. Then as if the concert wasn't interesting enough (and there is an option to play only the concert, plus a CD copy of the concert for added value) you get a really candid and informative set of documentary segments which are of the same tone as those on the band's Walk With Me in Hell DVD, and include the infamous fist fight which fans always seem to love.
Overall, Killadelphia is a brilliant DVD, honestly one of the best metal DVDs on the market and an absolute must buy for Lamb of God fans.",1288137600,,2199,4.555555555555555

2261213,1,B00092ZM0W,"The dvd itself is GREAT. However, I bought this new form Amazon, and it was scratched. I have to skip practically half the movie because it freezes up completely. Buy this form the store. Also buy walk with me in hell, which is even better.",1242950400,,240,4.355555555555555
2261214,5,B00092ZM0W,"this is my favorite music dvd in my library. lamb of god is awe inspiring! great view of the band on the road. i've watched this one a few times and still lovin' it. the only downside for me was the fight segment towards the end. with that exception the band comes across very professional and their musicianship is amazing.

well recomended!!",1231286400,,343,4.532258064516129
2261215,5,B00092ZM0W,"I am based in India,and I sincerely think you yankees should get adler as your next president. Anybody who can drum like the way he does HAS to be divine. Anyways,about the DVD - its a lot on the lines of Pantera's vulgar vids,but a lot lot better. My grouse with that dvd was that it focussed too much on the revelry to do justice to the musical genius of Pantera. This DVD has its fair share of drinking,smokin up,chicks,brawls ( some major drama there )and more,but it never strays from the 1 reason why anybody would buy a LOG dvd in the first place - THE MUSIC.The boys rip through a brilliant setlist and position themselves as worthy successors to Pantera as the new thrash metal titans.<devil horns> to Adler and Morton. The extra's are super cool too. All in all - A must have for thrash metal fans...",1187740800,,810,4.406666666666666
2261216,5,B00092ZM0W,"The details that Amazon.com has on display for this DVD has several mistakes in it.  Their list of the running time being ""120 minutes"" with ""30 minutes of exclusive behind-the-scenes on the road footage,"" is completely incorrect.  The DVD package clearly lists the running time for this documentary at 180 minutes, or 3 hours.  Yes, this DVD does contain ""Bonus Features"", but Amazon.com didn't correctly list them in their description of this DVD.  The bonus features are hidden easter eggs that lead to additional out-takes and deleted scenes, band and director commentary, ""Soundcheck"" segments, out-takes, and 3 music videos.  This DVD does NOT include the CD with all of the songs that Lamb of God was filmed performing for this DVD.  That is available for purchase separately, but I don't recommend buying it because the CD only contains live versions of songs from ""Ashes of The Wake"" and several of Lamb of God's previous CDs.  So, you really can skip the live CD altogether.  This DVD is all you need.

""Killadelphia"" was produced by High Roller Studios, NOT Sony.  However, it is manufactured by and distributed by Epic Music Video (A division of Sony/BMG Music Entertainment).  ""killadelphia"" was directed by Doug Spangenberg, who is under contract with High Roller Studios.  He also directed the documentary ""The Making of Sacrament"", which is the bonus disc included in the ""Deluxe Edition"" of Lamb of God's current CD, ""Sacrament"".  Another very good documentary that you should check out.

""Killadelphia"" can be viewed two (2) different ways.  You can choose to watch ONLY the concert footage by itself or you can watch the feature documentary movie ""Killadelphia"", which is a combination of behind the scenes footage of the band while their out on tour promoting the CD ""Ashes of The Wake"" and doing a lot of other stuff during the tour and between gigs.  There are numerous informal and semi-formal interviews with band members, the tour manager, and members of the road crew.  There are also some very good examples of ""Direct Cinema"" style documentary filmmaking in several scenes.  However, this documentary would was actually mostly filmed in a ""Cinma Verit"" style.

(Filmmakers, film students, and film nerds will know what the terms ""Direct Cinema"" and ""Cinma Verit"" mean.  If you don't know what they mean, but you want to, please look them up.)

I highly recommend this DVD to all Lamb of God fans, heavy metal lovers everywhere, and aspiring documentary filmmakers too.  The director, Doug Spangenberg, is a good director and he did very good job with this documentary.  This is one of my favorite DVDs in my ever-growing DVD collection.",1174780800,4,2664,5.018223234624146
2261217,5,B00092ZM0W,ANother great release by lamb of god any fan will want to snatch this up with their collection i did and glad. lots of out takes and behind the scenes.,1174003200,,151,4.066666666666666
2261218,5,B00092ZM0W,"When I first see this DVD, I already know that LOG is not just a heavy metal band but a metal band that will stay a very long time. With songs like Vigil, Hourglass, Something to Die For and Ruin...this DVD along with Machine Heads 'Elegies' and Arch Enemy's 'Live Apocalypse' is a must to have if you want to see bands perform at thier best....

Go and Buy this or miss something.......LOG rule",1165968000,,395,4.337837837837838
2261219,5,B00092ZM0W,From it's many behind the scenes features to the flawless live set spanning hits from all of their albums (except Sacrament) including Burn the Priest this DVD has it all. It's the perfect DVD if you are a lamb of god fan or just a modern metalhead. The part were they are stopped on the one way street in europe is unforgettable.,1158796800,,330,4.338709677419355
2261220,5,B00092ZM0W,"This DVD is one of my favorites. The Live Concert was so true to their CD's, that it just blew me away.

 I'm not a huge fan of this genre of music, but I love this band. By far, the best, to me, at the type of music they play. Everything about Lamb Of God just fits together so well, and Chris Adler's drumming, I think one of the top drummers in rock, or metal today. He, to me, really has a huge part in the what makes this band truelly kick *ss.

 So, now on to the DVD. The only problem I have with the sound of the DVD is, if you watch it in full mode, where it plays the whole DVD from begining to end, there is a very noticable change from the live concert performance to the road footage. I had to keep turning it up, and down, between the two, and that was from every clip to clip, due to the fact that they put the footage on the DVD, Concert footage/Road footage/concert footage/road footage....so it was up/down/up/down, all the way through the DVD. Great sound, don't get me wrong. It's just I wish it were leveled, to be at the same consistent volume. There's no problem, if you watch just the Live Concert by itself, rather than having the whole DVD play.

 The Live performance was just unbelievable.. I was wondering if Randy's vocals were going to be anywhere similar to how he is on there CD's, but he just ripped it up, as did everyone else in the band.

As far as the road footage, and behind the scenes stuff, it was really interesting to see how these guys were behind the music, as I guess it would be for anyone interested in anyone. It was cool that they showed it with both their ups and their downs, clowning around, and seriousness. Being in a band as well, they show you how it really basically is on the road, and being with a group of people for a long time. It can be fun, and sometimes really crazy. Willie and John keep you laughing your *ss off, so it doesn't all get too serious, and I think those guys really keep the band leveled out, in being really goofy n' kidding around alot. Its all pretty true to what the road is like.

 An extra bonus to this DVD is that each member of the band gives you a breakdown of a piece of one of each's favorite song that they play, showing you part of the song slowed down, and then showing you at it's full on speed, as well as showing you each ones rig. This all being done from stage at sound check. Cool idea.

 In most part this DVD f*cking rocks !!....with the exception of the sound issue, with me.",1140652800,,2481,4.137214137214137
2261221,5,B00092ZM0W,"Alright, I don't consider myself a die-hard L.O.G. fan, but I own three CD's, and listen to em' now then. I enjoy every aspect of they're music. From Randy's raw, gritty vocals to Chris Adlers amazing drum skills. They are good at what they do... not to mention Willie, and Mark on guitars. Anyways, what im getting at is, I have a high respect for these guys as musicians... but they aren't in my top 5 favorite bands. Regardless, this DVD is a must have for anyone that remotely likes they're music. These guys are mind blowing live, and the high quality audio/video compliments therye talent. Not to mention behind the scenes footage. Its as in depth as I have ever seen, as to what life is like as a touring metal band.. its' pretty interesting stuff to see, and the fact that they're all cool guys, it makes it entertaining to watch. So, if you can spare 12-13 dollars... pick it up.",1134259200,,888,4.45398773006135
2261222,5,B00092ZM0W,"My Highlights for this DVD are:

Black Label

Omerta

Terror and Hubris In the House of Frank Pollard

Ruin

Bloodletting (BTP classic)

The Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion

Vigil (favorite song)

Also, the videos for Laid to Rest and NYGSTDF were fantastic.

This DVD shows Lamb of God through triumph and tribulations, and if you're not a huge fan of this band, hopefully you will be when purchasing this DVD.

Can't wait 'til '06 for NEW LOG!",1133136000,,450,4.653846153846154
2261233,5,B00092ZM0W,"Lamb of God's major label deal with Epic Records certainly pays off on this DVD, as it is a very well put-together package.  The live concert is incredible, not only sounding wise but also a great performacne and set list by the band.  Between live songs in the main feature, it contains backstage footage of the band while touring, which is very raw, funny, and sometimes disbelieving (such as a fight between Randy and guitarist Mark Morton).  Other features of the DVD include soundchecks for each instrument, and mini lessons with each member on parts of songs.  Every aspect of the DVD is entertaining, and it sets a precedent for future metal DVDs for quality and live performance.  Buy it!",1132963200,,696,4.766666666666667
2261234,5,B00092ZM0W,"I'm usually pretty wary of buying metal bands' DVDs because I'm afraid that they'll just sound horrible live. With each metal DVD I've bought though, the sound of each band's sound just got better and better. That's when I came across Lamb Of God's Killadelphia. For the price I paid (a whopping 8.99), I couldn't have been more pleased. The sound quality is remarkable, sounding exactly like their CDs. Randy's voice is perfect in every aspect and the band follows suitingly. What I didn't expect when I purchased this was the fact that it would include some of LoG's trials and tribulations throughout their touring, much like Mudvayne's All Access To All Things DVD or even Chimaira's The Dehumanizing Process. Both are extremely good in their own rights and this kind of follows in their tracks while being completely different. At times Randy is very obnoxious and even a bit annoying but that just makes this movie seem that much more real, they don't put on an act when the cameras are running, they're just themselves. As far as the actual concert goes, though I would've loved to see a couple more songs from New American Gospel, it was really good. I really appreciated the fact that they played Bloodletting from their debut as Burn The Priest. That song is also a shining moment in the concert. Every song is filled with hatred and energy, just like the CD, and it reflects in how good LoG's performance was. The crowd was as good a crowd as I've seen in a DVD for a long time, so that only added to the already stellar footage.

If you're a fan of Lamb Of God, casual or hardcore, you should get this. I mentioned Chimaira's The Dehumanizing Process DVD earlier, and while I loved every second of it and thought the concert footage was amazing, LoG destroys their release with Killadelphia. This might actually end up being 2005's best music DVD release so that's really saying something. This is the best testament to 'American' metal I've come across in a while. In a time where foreign metal acts are ruling the genre, LoG proves that Americans still do it best.",1132876800,2,2078,4.662125340599455
2261235,4,B00092ZM0W,"I picked this DVD up because in truth, I had nothing better to do. I liked Lamb of God's music, but was not a die-hard fan. Needless to say this DVD completely blew me away, and at times, I wondered if it was dubbed. Before too long, however, I realized that it was just great production--mabye a little too great. While it SOUNDS good, to some, the remastering takes away from the ""concert"" feel. The Dolby 5.1 makes up for some of this, but it's still not the same. All in all a great concert tho, a must have for all Lamb of God fans. They also include lots of extras and on the road footage, including some hidden easter eggs, of which I don't think I've found all of yet. The fight scene between Randy and their guitarist(cant remember his name, sorry!) is both priceless and scary at the same time. It's a real, raw look into the life of a musician and shouldn't be missed. Check it out!",1132617600,,893,4.258823529411765
2261236,5,B00092ZM0W,I'll make this short and sweet.  The 5.1 audio mix and video quality are better than just about any concert DVD I've seen.  The in depth look at life inside a tour with Lamb of God is truly genuine and real.  This DVD will take you on a heavy metal emotional roller coaster that you will want to experience over and over again!!!,1132185600,,329,4.190476190476191

2261239,5,B00092ZM0W,"Of all the american bands that have emerged from the past 6 years, Lamb of God still rules supreme.  Their latest DVD is a masterpiece in the making. This brings the best of how LOG can play live and it also shows the human side of the up's and downs of life on the road for a band that knows how to deliver their own style of thrash metal. A style of music that unfortunately still scares people because of its lyrical content but also shows that metal does not need mainstream to survive. The bands themselves show us,the fans, that this style of music will live on forever and nothing will get in their in their way of their deliverance.  Horns Up!!!",1125705600,4,653,4.300813008130081

There are so many extra things on here, it'll take you hours to find everything...the hidden ""easter eggs"" are hilarious...have fun finding them. The guys' off stage antics will entertain you just as much as their live show will capture you. You'll love every moment. If you've seen them live before, then you know the energy and the passion they put into their live shows....and this DVD captures all the passion, blood, sweat, and tears that make up Lamb of God.",1125273600,,690,4.663934426229508

The extras are awesome, each band member has an interview and gives a short tutorial on how to play part of a song.  They even interview the crew, which is great because you rarely get to see what they do and how they feel.  If you think you might be a Lamb of God fan, buy it.",1123718400,3,547,3.8828828828828827
2261256,4,B00092ZM0W,this is my first cd by them and I'm really surprised at the selection!,1123545600,,70,4.071428571428571
2261257,5,B00092ZM0W,"First of all, the drunken fist fight in Glasgow between Mark & Randy is worth the price tag. I'm serious, its hilarious. That said, the entire DVD is impressive. Well edited live show, great sound (dolby 5.1) & plenty of footage of the band messing around, traveling on tour & just being themselves. Interviews with each member & demonstrations/tips on some of their guitar & drums was a cool idea. I would have liked to have all their music videos included, but I'm not complaining. I'm not sure where/what the easter eggs are as i can't be bothered to search for them. (I never really understood the ""easter egg"" concept).

P.S.: If you're a Lamb of God fan you should already own this DVD. ;)",1123459200,4,695,4.56
2261258,2,B00092ZM0W,"Review by Mike Watson:

Epic Music Video in association with the incredible High Roller Studios bring to us the two and a half hour whine and mellow drama fest that is Lamb Of God.  On Killadelphia you will be forced to suffer through some of the most boring live footage put to tape, terrible pranks that aren't even close to being funny or even shocking, and more whining about their rock star lives then you could even imagine.

We'll start off with the live footage.  Sure it may sound good, but actually watching it could and probably will induce comatose.  Why a band would release fifteen videos of them just standing around on a stage is beyond me.  The pranks aren't even worth mentioning, on of the most jaw dropping of them being one of the members putting some kind of igniting cap on another members cigarette that makes an explosion a bit smaller then that of the little snap and pop firecrackers you throw on the ground.  Then there is the whining, oh god the whining, all of the in between songs is them whining about photo shoots or how their equipment was there only three and half hours before they had to play.  Most touring bands have to take their own equipment, and show up with it and set it up themselves.  Lamb Of God has a tour bus with a trailer on the back of that and a U-Haul trailer that follows them behind that not to mention a team of around 5-10 people.

This DVD honestly makes me sick to appreciate metal and this bands music.  Lamb Of God obviously has themselves confused with Aerosmith and if there were one more push pit in this DVD, it would have been tapped for a Staind music video.  Not to mention the fact that this DVD was pushed back four or five times.  Why High Roller Studios would openly put their name on this is beyond me.  Steal this DVD if you feel like a good laugh, or need another reason to hate Lamb Of God, just don't waste your money.",1122940800,2,1897,4.337110481586402
2261259,5,B00092ZM0W,"this is one of the best music dvds i have purchased some of the behind the scenes stuff is very funny espeacily the outtakes very funny cause they where in england and they parked the wrong way on a one way street and thier was a guy and his girl in there car in front of them and they made up a storie what they where saying to each other in other words this dvd is hilarious

BUY IT!!! BUY IT!!!! BUY IT!!!",1122595200,,408,3.9156626506024095
2261260,5,B00092ZM0W,"Wow, this DVD had everything except porn to keep it entertaining. We all know Lamb of God is an overrated band (we can thank Epic's promotion campaign for this), but that doesnt mean they cant release a top-notch quality DVD. you're defently getting your money's worth. Theres a great set list that the band goes through, and some rather funny moments off the stage (my favorite being when the drunken fan mistakes mark morton for willie adler, and insists that it's him) and even a crazy drunken fight between randy and mark (randy's head-butt was classic!). Theres no reason to not get this DVD. Even a moderate fan will appreciate it.",1122508800,,637,4.747747747747748
2261261,5,B00092ZM0W,"This is probably one of the best music dvds i've watched.  The live show is great and you get to see what its really like to be part of the band, the good days, and the fights.  Stacks of extras, including soundchecks where the band go through the gear they use and show you how to play parts of their songs. Highly recommend to any Lamb of God fan.",1122336000,2,349,4.043478260869565
2261262,5,B00092ZM0W,"One of the better bands to emerge from the ""metalcore"" scene, Lamb of God's Killadelphia DVD finds the band performing in Philly, and the DVD includes behind the scenes footage showing the band on the road, and everything else in between.  The concert segments themselves are nicely filmed, with a solid track list that fans of the band will no doubt enjoy.  The main highlight of Killadelphia is however, the backstage footage which shows the band dealing with everything bands usually do, even if that includes two band members duking it out.  Some hidden easter eggs are included as well, along with some music videos, which nicely round out the package.  All in all, for fans of Lamb of God, Killadelphia is an absolute must own.",1122163200,6,733,4.7936507936507935
2261273,5,B00092ZM0W,"This is one of the best music DVD's I've seen.  The live show shot in philly has great sound and the camera work is really good.  The main thing that I think makes this DVD awesome is how the director incorporated live footage of the band hanging out and basically ""on tour"" between songs.  This aspect really breaks the monotony of watching a live performance on a TV.  The set list they used is amazing, it has killer songs from all three lamb of god albums.  It also contains some good interviews with the band in sort of like a get to know your metal band segment.  If you like L.O.G. pick this DVD up, it'll make you love 'em.",1121990400,2,631,4.216666666666667
2261274,5,B00092ZM0W,"All I have to say is WOW....i have always had Lamb of God at the top of my favorite band lists but this just set them at the top spot....permanently.  I picked up this DVD at the Sounds of the Underground tour..by the way Lamb of God's set was the best of the night...complete chaos...but the DVD's whole concert is awesome every song is ggod....especially ""The Subtle Arts of Murder and Persausion""  the behind the scenes stuff is just as good too...watch everything on this DVd...especially the hidden easter eggs...if you can find them...whis i haven't yet...why are you still reading this...you should be on the way to the store to get this DVD NOW!!!",1121040000,3,655,4.6869565217391305
2261275,5,B00092ZM0W,"i suggest if you have ever seen or heard ANY lamb of god song and thought 'hrm, that sounds cool', then youg et this DVD.

the production is absolutely awesome, beautiful sound, awesome video, the extras are sweet as with backstage footage, behind the scenes filming footage, and lessons from each instrument playing member.

the musicianship of chris adler on drums, willie adler on guitar, mark morton on guitar, and john campbell on bass is truly amazing, the riffing rivals anything i've ever heard.  this is RIFFING, not SOLOING, but it's so intense and they are so tight it's unreal.

GET THIS DVD, IF YOU HAVE ANY SLICE OF METAL BLOOD IN YOUR BODY.",1121040000,12,655,4.719298245614035
2261276,5,B00092ZM0W,"The title of my review says it all.  The live concert is simply amazing.  Mark Morton and Willie Adler relentlessly shread and riff, but the true star of the show is Chris Adler on Drums.  Simply put, he is a metal drum machine.  Amazing stuff.  While the sound and the musicianship of the concert is amazing, the real treat of this DVD is the behind the scenes stuff.  It was great to watch Mark Morton knock Randy Blyth out cold on the streets of England.  Randy deserved it.  You get to know each of these guys intimately.  They are an interesting group of guys.  Even the LOG road crew are profiled on this DVD, which shows real class. The DVD has no weaknesses.  There is nothing hear you would not want to see.  looking forward to seeing them on the Sounds of The Underground tour.  I Can't believe we are getting to see bands like LOG, Opeth, Chimaira, Unearth and Strapping Young Lad in one show.",1120608000,9,904,4.373493975903615

Well I just had to see how they pulled off the songs live cause this aint no easy thrash metal, this is blazing fast heavy sh*t!  Let me tell you these guys can play live as good as they do on the album.  The DVD was entertaining as hell; I know cause I have a sore neck after headbanging through the whole damn thing.",1119571200,6,470,4.247191011235955
