8576445,5,B00C2AR1YO,"since my baby turned 14 months, this DVD is her favorite vs. Baby Einstein, Baby Genius and so on. Now she is 17 months old and she begins to laugh and dance each time I turn it on. She sings do, re, mi etc. she tries to sing the song a la vibora, vibora, vibora de la mar in her own language. It's a great educational video for children up to 36 months. The baby will learn the different instruments and songs, see children playing the instruments, listen to the great Mexican nursery in Spanish. The way how video is formed is the most appropriate for baby comprehension comparing to other videos we have at home. This one is the only one she follows from the beginning to the end completely involved and repeating what they are teaching.",1414454400,,740,4.369565217391305

I know that no DVD is recommended for children under two according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, but when the baby is high maintenance and I need to get the house work done, this DVD is the best win-win that I can find.",1382745600,,369,4.318840579710145
