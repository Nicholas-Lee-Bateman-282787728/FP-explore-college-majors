8658244,1,B00KFRB480,"This is a horrible video! I live outside the US with my kids, so I was shopping for videos in English to have with us that go a bit beyond YouTube. From the positive reviews, I would have thought this was a series with positive values about friendship and girl power. Instead it is a disgusting series about girls focused on their appearance, pretending in a very ditsy, air-headed way to be interested in environmental issues (while actually showing nothing but focus on their own primping and little girly air-head vocal noises... ah! eee! ooo! Worse than that the video is about a mean-girls' clique. There is literally no one else, except the occasional awe-struck boy in the world. These girls are so self-centered they don't even know they are leaving people out. I can't think of much that would be worse role-modeling for my daughter. This video is disappearing despite the fact that we have such a limited supply. I am hesitating over donating it to an ESL program because I don't want to damage the children of strangers either.",1454889600,6,1038,4.740331491712707

8658250,3,B00KFRB480,My daughter likes the movie. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because there are three mini shows. Not movie length which is what I was hoping for. She was a little disappointed it didn't have more.,1411430400,,205,4.282051282051282
