3978410,5,B002SAMMAQ,"Over the course of 2 days, I watched this film three times.  The third time was with the movie commentary.

I found the film to be quirky, intricate in detail, well written and well acted.  The surprised came when listening to the commentary.  Strangely enough the director/writer felt that Rusty and Danny being together in the end was a sad compromise for Rusty after experiencing and enjoying(?) the danger and excitement of Denny.

I was thinking totally outside of that box through the movie.  Rusty, being detail oriented and meticulous about design and dating a similar person in Danny, was bored.  Yet, Danny's trip away for a while was like an invitation to Rusty to have a last minute fling before settling down.

I believe everyone is drawn to people totally unlike ourselves so we can experience things that we would never do on our own.  So while many see Rusty in the end as a failure, I see him as someone deeply flawed--as flawed as drug addicted Denny--yet someone who opened himself up to experience outside his box and now someone who can bring some excitement to Danny.

I don't view Rusty's hookup with Denny as Rusty discovering his true self, but simply Rusty realizing that all in his life need not be so linear.

There were some truly inspired lines in the movie...the best one being words exchanged between Rusty and Denny.  Rusty said, after a night of passionate sex that Denny made him feel like someone else.  Denny, in an inspired moment of clarity, perhaps, responded to say that maybe Rusty felt like himself for the first time.

People aren't one extreme or another but a moving point on a spectrum.  This was the main point of this film...for me.",1275177600,2,1681,4.689419795221843

3978412,3,B002SAMMAQ,"Many people would consider Rusty to be a ""Lucky Bastard"" (2009) ... a handsome, buff young man with a promising career as an architect specializing in restoration of period homes.  When his stodgy lover leaves town on business, Rusty encounters a young drifter named Denny, whose natural charm and hustler persuasion entice Rusty to finance his crystal habit for a time, while Rusty holds out hope that he can change him. But it is Rusty who ultimately changes, in coming to terms with some things in his life with which he has never been very comfortable, and taking the initiative to do what he should have done long ago.

This isn't an easy movie to watch, and the first half hour or so seems more like a soft core porn film than anything resembling a story.  The low budget shows in the production quality, although I thought the acting was commendable, especially Dale Dymkoski (who is identified with ""Law & Order:SVU"" on the DVD jacket; I checked, and he appeared in ONE episode!) as Denny, a character he managed to make likeable despite his faults.  I also give them credit for an ending I did not anticipate, and for their honesty in portraying a side of gay life that we don't like to talk about.  DVD extras include commentary and lengthy deleted scenes; unrated, but would be a heavy R.  I give the film three stars out of five.",1260576000,48,1341,4.589958158995816

3978426,2,B002SAMMAQ,"Dale Dymkoski does a nice job playing a drug addicted guy, and brings some redeeming qualities to the role. But the screenplay is so limp it defies belief, and I thought 'it is a horror movie' and the main character is too stupid to get away from the villain. He robs him blind, no problem.  He gives a blowjob to a dealer, then returns to car to make out with central character, no problem.  Really??? It is well intentioned, and relevant material, but really lame.

And the ""action"" is so intense, swinging from one unbelievable melodrama to another, that my  credulity was stretched and then broken.  The resolution to the film came out of nowhere, and instead of being a pleasant surprise made me say, aloud, ""What the f. . .?""

3978447,3,B002SAMMAQ,"This is an offering from gay director and writer Everett Lewis. It tells the story of Rusty (Patrick Tatten) who is a successful restoration architect. He is in a long term relationship but currently staying in a motel, because Janice Joplin had once stayed there. Then his boyfriend has to leave town on business and Rusty has a spate of throwing the toys from his pram, over a change in business direction with his business partner.

He decides to go out and get some wine, and at the store he meets a random guy called Denny (Dale Dymkoski), as they are both gay they have to go to the nearest toilet for some empty and meaningless sex. However, for some inexplicable reason Rusty seems to fall `in love' with him straight away. That was a bit of a stretch, if we had have been dealing with lust, I for one would have found the whole thing more believable.

What is more intriguing is that Denny soon asks for some cash to go and score some crystal meth, so that they can `make sweet music' for longer whilst watching Denny in one of his first porn features, that is after admitting he is HIV. He is just soo romantic isn't he? What follows is a spiral into drug abuse for Denny and a spiral up to reality for Rusty. The acting is all above average and the camera work is good, it is just the plot and in places the dialogue, there is no holding back on the potty mouth conversations, which life can be like so I have no issues with that per se. Whilst Denny teaches Rusty a thing or two about public displays of affection, there are no new morale tales here. We get it that drugs are bad etc.

The drug induced paranoia is done rather well and I found out that a lot of the dialogue is from actual life encounters that Lewis has had, especially from Alcoholics Anonymous. It could be that a tapestry of people's lives just does not fit into the story of just two people and that could be where the story falls down. After all is said and done still quite a good effort, but you will not be wanting to see it a second time. Also some eye candy but not enough to warrant a place in anyone `special' DVD collection either.",1322784000,2,2123,4.276119402985074
3978448,3,B002SAMMAQ,"This movie is nothing special. I did manage to watch the full piece however found the ending slightly disappointing.

The story itself is nothing spectacular. The acting is mediocre. The two actors are very good looking and if you like looking at good looking males well, I suppose you will not be disappointed.

3978450,2,B002SAMMAQ,"So-so drama about Rusty (Patrick Tatten), a young architect who specializes in restoring houses.  His latest rehabilitation project becomes Denny (Dale Dymkoski), a drug addicted low-life he picks up in a convenience store.  Rusty becomes obsessed with Denny, who in turn uses him to support his crystal meth habit.

There aren't many likeable characters in this one.  Denny, of course, is a sleazebag, and Rusty is a classic enabler, who is more interested in hanging onto his new boyfriend than in really trying to help him.  It's hard to develop much sympathy for such a pathetic door mat who over and over allows himself to be used and abused.  All I wanted to do was slap him in the head to try to knock some sense into him.  The only really nice guy in the whole movie is Rusty's business partner, who tries to help him break free from Denny's spell.

The story is far-fetched, particularly toward the end where Denny tells his sad life story.  His sudden transformation from first-class creep to pathetic victim seems forced and unconvincing, as does Rusty's reaction to it.  The story ends on a happy note for most of the characters, although again, it is unrealistic.

The movie is well made, although the score is a bit irritating.  The actors are fine, particularly Dymkoski. But the script just isn't believable.",1312761600,5,1324,4.8097345132743365
3978451,4,B002SAMMAQ,"I can understand why this film failed to impress some viewers - it's a low-budget gay indie film, the performances aren't particularly memorable and there isn't much of a plot.  Yet for me the film had a special quality - there's just something about the way the story is told that I found really touching and poignant.

Rusty is a successful architect who specializes in restoring period homes.  He's incredibly handsome - with a buff, chunky, muscular body, expressive dark brown eyes, and soft, wavy hair. The film makes full use of all this - Rusty is shown in varying degrees of undress for much of the film. Rusty's boyfriend, Daniel, is another successful type, and, Rusty, with his model-like beauty and career, really does seem a ""lucky bastard"".

When Daniel goes on a business trip, Rusty meets Denny, a brash, HIV-positive crystal meth addict with a mysterious past.  The attraction between them is instant and electric, and the two begin a passionate affair.  Up until then, Rusty had led a play-it-safe, decent, fairly conventional life, but somehow feels drawn towards Denny's dark world of drugs, sex, pleasure and living for the moment in the L.A. underground scene.

Rusty is intrigued by this new lifestyle, but at the same time recoils from it. The film explores this internal contradiction many of us, and certainly I, have experienced - we are thrilled about drifting outside our comfort zone, and the sense of danger and excitement that brings, yet feel anchored by the stability and 'safeness' of our usual lives.

The film has a beautiful, fluid texture to it as Rusty's encounter with a very different person leads him to re-evaluate his life and goals.  For me there were some wonderful moments - the evocative scene where Rusty and Denny embrace on an L.A. street with the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood Sign in the distant background, and Denny's monologue about how he came to be a crystal meth addict.

Watch the deleted scenes in the DVD - they're good and I can't imagine why the one where Rusty and Denny share their coming out stories didn't make into the movie proper.",1285632000,16,2107,4.8277777777777775
3978452,3,B002SAMMAQ,"I am not surprised that the reviews I have read of this film are as different as their scores (one has the film at one star, the other at five). The two extremes are perhaps the best way of describing the film in its entirety. One one hand the story is excellent as one would expect from an accomplished writer (Everett Lewis), whereas the final product lacks substance and quality as a result of two lacklustre performances on the part of Rusty (Patrick Tatten)and Denny (Dale Dymkoski).

In summary the story follows Rusty a successful architect and home restoration expert, who despite his professional success has never allowed himself the same emotional passion he finds in his work. He is the archetype of normative society, living his gay life in secret. He acts and sounds heterosexual, and only becomes himself (or that which he allows) when he feels safe. That safety is limited to his closest friend and business partner, and the space he calls home. He is ultimately both mentally and emotionally stunted, and whilst he allows another to love him, he fails to realise his self-imposed protective walls will never allow him to love back. This makes for a fertile breeding ground and easy manipulation by Denny, a young, good-looking street hustler well versed in the art of manipulation. Denny is able to manipulate Rusty by providing him the fire, passion and excitement so patently absent from his normal life. Many people as beautiful in my experience have an unspoken carnal power, which operates as magic in the world of men and women. They are able to pass through life much easier than most, as people naturally gravitate towards them. Despite their patent failings one is happy to be accepted and approved by them, and has a great sense of satisfaction merely being tolerated by their beauty. One of course should never invest time and commitment in the life of someone who considers you nothing more than an opportunity, or convenient option.

The audience as the casual observer sees Denny for who he is, but due to the excellent writing and characterisation of Everett Lewis, cannot help but feel mesmerised by his charisma and beauty. Your mind screams run, but every thing else says to stay. Denny as a result stands on the precipice of personal success or failure. Either he allows himself to be enveloped by Denny, and slowly begin the decent in that world of drugs, perversity and carnal passions. Or he finally emerges from his diminutive emotional state, to take charge of his desires and grow emotionally.

Both the actors are extremely good looking, and if you require nothing more than eye-candy then this film should be enough for you. If you require more, you may be a little disappointed. With only a little research you will understand why. Patrick Tatten and Dale Dymkoski are very new with little, if any, real acting experience. Dale Dymkoski is better known for being a fitness instructor than an actor, although his portrayal of the drug obsessed and failed Denny was not half bad. Patrick Tatten has a quiet demeanour about him, which seems self evident in his portrayal of Rusty, almost as if he is overwhelmed by the acting experience. With time and additional experience I believe both actors will become better, however for the purposes of this film (and its script) both actors should have been more experienced and skilled.

If you enjoy the evolution of a script and are able to watch this film between the frames, as one would read a book, then you may actually like the final product. Of course this is not a book, and as a film I am of the opinion it ultimately fails. That aside I was not disappointed by Everett Lewis's writing, and was enamoured by his characterisation, plot analysis and structure. This was not sufficient to carry the film, and as a consequence it becomes nothing more than average, with an after taste of regret.",1278460800,3,3887,4.8056801195814645
