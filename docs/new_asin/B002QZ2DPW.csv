3969036,3,B002QZ2DPW,"I have both the SD version of Lock Stock and Snatch, I rank this movie in my top 10 all time list.  It's just a brilliant movie!!

HOWEVER, the Blu-ray version is VERY poor quality, the SD DVD version actually looks better.  There is A LOT of graining in the Blu-Ray version, it's as if they got the compression all wrong.  I'm running this from some high end audio/video equipment on a 63"" Mitsubishi DLP and Sony BD player thru Harmon Kardon (all have the most recent firmware updates) -- this is the ONLY BD I've purchased that has this terrible graining.  Even tested it on my MacPro using my LG BD player and noticed the same graining problem.

I came up with a 3 rating because the film content is excellent worth a 5 star, however, the BD image quality get a 1 star, hence the resulting 3 stars.  Unfortunate mess up, but I have to say go with the standard SD DVD version.",1260489600,28,879,4.290909090909091
3969037,5,B002QZ2DPW,"I've owned Both Previous Standard Version of
Guy Ritchie's  Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels  on DVD
This Film is One of the BEST Films of The late 90's
With a Perfect Cast and a Story That can run neck and neck with any of Quentin Tarantino's Films
There's Nothing quit like it and NO American Film could Pull it off
Hopefully the BR Version with Live up to the SD Version and Get the proper Attention and Gain a much bigger fan base.
It's a True work of art and a roller coaster ride that u don't wanna get off

I Highly Recommend 2 all Movie Fans!!!!

3969062,5,B002QZ2DPW,"Saw this one in the theaters, I've seen it about 10 times since. This one belongs on your movie bucket list.

It's particularly unusual because there's a huge array of different characters, yet they're all quite distinct in a way that you have zero problems remembering who is who and what they're after. They have a feeling like they're real. Since it is the mileau where Guy Ritchie, the creator, lived in, it seems likely that it's an at least partly true story.

The first film from Guy Ritchie. Watch this one along with Snatch and the two Sherlock Holmes films, of his works. As it's his first, it's worth watching first, as it's possibly his best due to story but, in terms of technique and development, probably the ""roughest"".",1437868800,,735,4.6461538461538465

3969071,5,B002QZ2DPW,One of the guy ritchie trilogy this one is so good and with a younger Jason Statham so many twists and turns but it all works out in the end,1409011200,,140,3.7
3969072,4,B002QZ2DPW,"The movie is great. I accidentally stumbled upon in theaters when I was in college. My buddy and I had gone to see something else. It was sold out. Figured this looked interesting. And wow. We were both blown away. The movie is extremely clever and funny. I'd probably put it in my Top 10 comedies. The dialogue can be tough to follow, and I find myself picking up new things every time I rewatch it.

All that being said, the Blu Ray itself didn't impress me. It was very grainy and didn't feel at all as if I was watching a movie in high definition. But for the price, I suppose I can't complain too much. So I still gave it four stars because the movie is great and the price is cheap. But I would imagine this Blu Ray is so cheap because it's widely understood that the transfer isn't all that great.",1405036800,,804,4.187096774193549

3969076,4,B002QZ2DPW,"Well, Guy Ritchie's done it again! The movie typically starts with a slow pace with many colorful characters/groups living out their bizarre lives. As the story unfolds, the pace picks up, helped by a snappy music track. In the end all the individual stories get intertwined that makes for a thrilling final scene.
Brilliant.
The quality of the disc is not exactly topnotch, low light & dark scenes come across grainy, but the quality of the movie makes you forget this minor problem.",1380499200,,484,4.843373493975903

3969078,4,B002QZ2DPW,"When i saw the deal on this movie being less than $10, i was hyped, hoping it was re-mastered somehow. I'd totally forgotten the movie was low-budget to begin with and shot well before HD was even an option. If you find it as cheap or cheaper than DVD, go ahead but don't buy it for the Bluray factor.",1376611200,,301,4.11864406779661

3969080,5,B002QZ2DPW,"If you are familiar with the genre then you're familiar with this movie.

If you aren't familiar with this genre then there's no better film to start with. It's a story of four friends who find themselves in deep quickly. It's all about different worlds colliding and then resolving. It's got action, humor, and everything else any guy would want in a movie.",1368489600,,358,4.682539682539683

3969086,3,B002QZ2DPW,I love this film. I got it on DVD and was disappointed in the way it looked. Then I got it on Blu-Ray and it looks bad too. I compared the two on my Blu-Ray player and the Blu-Ray is only incrementally better. People have got to stop giving this good reviews or they'll never remaster this thing properly for home release.,1356652800,7,322,4.209677419354839
3969087,5,B002QZ2DPW,"Saw this movie years ago and liked it so much I made a point to pick it up on BluRay.

3969089,5,B002QZ2DPW,"Please don't let the other negative reviews convince you that the DVD is just as good.  It's not.  The Blu ray version DOES show massive grain because of the source.  Could it be better... probably.  However the original DVD version was not a good looking movie upconverted on a 50"" screen.  The Blu ray on that same screen is much more clear.  So if you love this movie and you have a Blu Ray player then you really should upgrade.",1287100800,6,432,4.3375
3969090,5,B002QZ2DPW,This was Guy Ritchie's first film before he did Snatch and got famous. This was also one of Jason Satham's first films as well. Great Movie.,1286150400,,140,4.423076923076923

3969096,2,B002QZ2DPW,"Not worth the price on Blu Ray, very grainy. Buy the DVD, quality is the same and it is CHEAPER! This Blu Ray should be offered always on a BARGAIN price due to picture quality. The movie otherwise is great, sometimes even better than the Tarrantino films on this genre.",1262995200,2,270,4.42
3969097,3,B002QZ2DPW,"The movie itself is brilliant, original, funny, perfectly cast and on my top-10 list. However, if you have the original don't waste your $$ on the Blue-ray. On the Blue-ray special features is a discussion about budget compromises Ritchie and the photographer were forced to make like shooting on 16mm. On the original DVD it blends with the movie and works. On Blue-ray its distracting and jarring. On balance and in my opinion, the Blue-ray is inferior to the original.",1261353600,18,471,4.9

8378153,5,B002QZ2DPW,"Crime caper with dark humor and very intricate plot. Easier to follow on screen than to describe the plot. Impressive that this film has such a complex plot, with multiple characters, and yet maintains its ""Full-Ahead"" momentum without confusing the audience. Four cockney guys (not thugs, just guys trying to make some $ through card gambling) scramble to find $ to pay off their inadvertent/ unplanned-for large gambling loss to a local gangster. Circumstances involve a dizzying array of good luck/bad luck events that bring multiple gangsters into the plot. Very fast moving and brilliant. Good to watch on video, because cockney accents can be difficult to comprehend all the dialog on first listen. This film can be watched multiple times, because it is so complex a plot, and it doesn't get old. Highly recommended as one of the best British gangster films ever made.",1493596800,,874,5.0344827586206895
8378154,5,B002QZ2DPW,"I've probably either watched, or worked in the same room while this movie played in the background a couple of dozens times. It never gets old for me.

Some Brit humor is just damn funny. I love 'Shaun of the Dead, too. English sense of dark/black sense of humor  reminds me I'm not the only weirdo.

Definitely worth the low price.",1489017600,2,332,4.409836065573771
