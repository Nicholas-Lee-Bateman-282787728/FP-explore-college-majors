6546628,1,B00M1CFU8C,Awful.  Stupidly silent. Could not finish.  Next time just punch me in the face and tell me I just watched this movie.,1417478400,,118,4.318181818181818
6546629,3,B00M1CFU8C,not much too say about this movie,1415664000,,33,3.857142857142857
6546630,5,B00M1CFU8C,"Many people will not like this film, it is slow and quiet, and can be confusing because of no dialog, but it is also beautiful and brilliant. What is not said can be read on the actor's faces and subtle actions, needless to say the acting is near perfect, they narrate paragraphs of dialog with their eyes, especially Sophie Lowe. Yes, this makes many parts of the film slow down, but the beauty that comes from this pace is well worth your patience. Give it a chance, you will at least enjoy the scenery.",1414540800,5,505,4.382978723404255

6546632,1,B00M1CFU8C,"This is quite possibly the second worst movie I have ever seen (second only to the grapes of wrath). Something like 40 minutes into the film before the first word is spoken, and the entire film has literally no dialogue. It's like a village full of mutes who just stare at each other rather than speak. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!!!!",1412467200,2,330,4.610169491525424
6546633,3,B00M1CFU8C,Meh,1412121600,,3,3.0
6546634,2,B00M1CFU8C,"Two unnamed children's parents die and they try to survive in their rustic Alps farm. Unnamed teen girl gets raped and hunted. Not much dialogue. Many slow scenes such as the boy getting a splinter. Girl swims naked. People go to mass. Even the action scenes were slow. Not much to see here. Remarkably won best feature at the San Diego Film Festival 2013. Maybe I am missing something.

Some nudity (Sophie Lowe)",1406073600,,413,4.657534246575342
8669701,5,B00M1CFU8C,Yes I did watch on it and I think it was a good movie in my opinion. I know that of course you know I don't have rent videos at any locations and I don't have WiFi at my home. I think it is better than nothing.,1530144000,,210,3.4893617021276597
8669702,2,B00M1CFU8C,For the first hour of this movie no one talks at all. This makes the plot a bit tough to follow. The action doesnt really get started untll  half an hour b4 the end and the few sparse lines make it easier to understand.,1519862400,,219,3.977272727272727
8669703,1,B00M1CFU8C,"OK, after the first eighteen minutes with no dialog and a lot of visual babble I did this: cursed the wasted money, cracked the dvd before tossing it and decided I will no longer waste another penny on unknown dvd's from the reject barrel at Walmart.",1472860800,,250,4.456521739130435
8669704,1,B00M1CFU8C,"so I watched this movie due to it being constantly on my recommended list. I decided since it had gustav skarsgard in it that it had to be pretty decent. I love the skarsgard's. they are basically Swedish acting royalty in Sweden and are all pretty good actors. so I said, ""okay I will give this movie a try. its probably really good and intense"". oh my god was I wrong. first off, literally the first words that were even muttered in this movie  happened around 45 minutes into the movie. literally silence and just watching these 2 kids, a young brother and a older sister (who are never named?! wtf!?) watch their mother die of something like a disease or cancer ? its never explained?. then these kids bury her without notifying the town or anyone else. they continue their life but are suddenly prey to some guys from their village for some reason? these guys come in the older sisters home and rape her for no reason. we are about 50 minutes into this movie and I would bet money only 25 to 30 words have been said . this movie could pass as a silent film. im not kidding. at about an hour and 20 minutes in we are in a forest and this young girls attackers are chasing her? maybe to kill her or rape her again? im not even sure anymore. im questioning how I have made it this far into this film and what im doing with my time. by the time this film is over im more confused about what the hell this film was about in the first place. complete waste of time. no doubt in my mind. the fact that this film has won awards astounds me. the movie is completely confusing. no plot. no answers. nothing's explained. no dialogue whatsoever. probably 45 words are said in this 1 hour and 30 minute film. I cant believe I actually finished it. ugh...horrible. I don't recommend it at all. it sucks. I cant tell you enough how bad it is.",1430352000,,1832,4.264367816091954
8669705,3,B00M1CFU8C,FYI picked this up at the local dept. store a while back and the domestic dvd is edited more than a few seconds during the first act of violence (belt in mouth) compared to the international release.,1426204800,,199,4.405405405405405
8669706,1,B00M1CFU8C,This movie is great if you enjoy tales about a girl that gets raped multiple times before being pursued by her attackers through the forest. There's no dialog to be had. Autumn Blood is numbingly frustrating to watch but it lives up to the last name of its writer/director -- BLUNDER.,1421020800,,284,4.588235294117647
8669707,4,B00M1CFU8C,"I didn't mind that there was very little dialog in this movie. It made it more interesting to ""watch"" what was happening.
What I found tough to watch was what happens to the boy and especially the girl. Beautiful location and filming. Sophie Lowe was mesmerizing.",1420934400,3,263,4.739130434782608
8669708,1,B00M1CFU8C,"Dear director/writer, Mr. Blunder. Wtf. Too many story holes. Extremely unbelievable.",1419811200,,85,6.818181818181818
8669709,3,B00M1CFU8C,"Warning: Spoilers
How I saw this is that the girl's dad was not the person who got shot in the beginning of the movie.  He is the one who saved the girl in the end.  He was the one bringing the girl presents throughout the years.  He is the one who was arguing with the mother in the beginning and right after her husband was shot and killed.  Why else would he be arguing with her, and why else send the girl presents through the years.",1419724800,,437,4.046511627906977
8669710,2,B00M1CFU8C,Movie was slow the begin don't know what happen,1418169600,,47,4.333333333333333
