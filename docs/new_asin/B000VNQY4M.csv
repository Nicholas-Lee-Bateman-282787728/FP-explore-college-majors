8219534,1,B000VNQY4M,"I agree with previous review, this is awful. Here's a tip: anything directed by, produced by, or in any way associated with Bill Knell should be avoided. From decades old cable access show interviews to terrible production values, I have yet to see a DVD from this man that was half way decent.",1213833600,,294,4.566037735849057
8219535,1,B000VNQY4M,"I would not recommend anyone buy this item.  It is of extremely poor quality and a total rip-off.  No new information was provided.  There were merely excerpts from the news media and reports other peole made.  The narrator, what little narration he did, was not very knowledgeable about the subject.  The presentation was dreadful.  I cannot imagine producing something so lousy and having the nerve to expect people to pay good money for it.  It was nothing more than a home movie and poor quality at that.  Frankly I consider it a total joke.  Normally I am not so critical, but I honestly cannot think of one good thing to say about it.  I threw my copy out in the trash.",1200355200,,675,4.5041322314049586
