2410060,3,B000BB18NG,"The movie was not too bad.  I stalled in watching it a few times because of the bad reviews but was bored one day and decided to just watch it.  Being as I'm from Southeast Asia, I understand a lot about black magic, voodoo, and such (from my old school parents), so it was pretty interesting to see some of the ideas played out on this film.  I must say though that some of the black magic was too over the top and very unbelievable but the story line itself was good.

Here's the gist of it.  Spoiler alert**** A girl was having an affair with a married man and ended up pregnant with his baby.  He paid her off with a lot of money, as he is filthy rich, and shared her with some of his rich friends (practically had them rape her while filming it).  She wants him and his family dead so she goes to some shaman and had him cast black magic spells on all his family so she can have his estate, once they are all dead, through her baby.  Something something happens in between and unbeknownst to her, all his estate goes to his first common law wife and their kids and so she did the same thing to their family.  The only difference this time is she cast a spell on her eldest son and ended up married to the family.  Her revenge started from there....******End of spoiler.

All in all, it was a good film to watch.  The story line gets a little tricky because it goes back and fourth from present to past and past again to the NOW.  Pay close attention to it and I think you will like it....not too bad.",1289433600,,1505,4.113013698630137
2410061,3,B000BB18NG,"I bought this movie to watch with my Thai girlfriend and did not get teh chance. She told me kn the phone she was watching it.

She seemed to Enjoy it overall. When is howed this one and 1-2 to her she said its not for her. She lieks scary movies but this one did not apeal to her.

Well she did watch it and enjoyed it. I won't get to watch it untill Aug. But i am looking forward to it.

I gave the 3 star because i have not seen it. I would have givin it a 1 or a 2. It was moved to a three because of my girl friends opinon. First she said not for her than she said good movie. So it changed her mind.

I am looking forward to it though",1272931200,,640,3.6159420289855073
2410062,2,B000BB18NG,"While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didn't expect was the ""non existent"" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock.",1191715200,4,666,4.2936507936507935
2410063,4,B000BB18NG,The movie brings nothing new and is rather predictable but I have a fondness for revenge flicks.  A girl gets used and thrown away by a guy and she seeks revenge by going to a man who uses magic.  The girl befriends the family and watches as they die in weird ways offering the remaining family members consolation. So nothing new but I enjoyed a few of the death scenes.  If you do choose to watch it please make sure you watch it in the Thai audio because the dubbing is really bad.,1177372800,3,484,4.182795698924731
2410064,2,B000BB18NG,"So ... given my rather glowing review of ""Long Khong"" (Art of the Devil 2), was ""Kong Len Khong"" (Art of the Devil) any good?  Nah ... the first Art of the Devil turns out to be just a pedestrian Thai horror movie with little horror, a predictable story, some gore (bleeding gullets and razor blades galore) but not much else.  Here's the Cliffs Notes summary: A pretty young woman is introduced to a rich middle aged man, and proceeds to have a torrid affair with him.  She gets pregnant and blackmails him into paying her off.  He gets upset and arranges for her to be gang-raped by three of his rich friends.  She gets more upset and pays an evil shaman to bump him and his family (and his lecherous friends and their families as well) off in nasty ways (picture bloody gullets, razor blades, and rusty nails).  Then she gets even MORE upset when the estate of the rich man goes to his common-law wife's family (i.e. ""unofficial"" second wife i.e. concubine/mistress).  And so the evil shaman gets more business, casting a love spell on the eldest (illegitimate) son so that his conniving client can sleep her way into the family and then kill them off one by one with the aim of ultimately inheriting the late rich man's estate.  But she did not count on the late rich man's plucky young (illegitimate) daughter and her inquisitive reporter friend.  And so both her and her evil shaman get their comeuppance in due course, after a lot of eels, cowhides, bloody gullets, razor blades and rusty nails again (which obviously don't mixed well), and gunshots.  End of movie.  I did say it was a rather pedestrian Thai horror movie.",1169510400,10,1629,4.582758620689655
2410065,3,B000BB18NG,"I saw this movie yesterday and I have to say that ASIAN horror flicks have a way of coming out with original ways for its characters to pass away.

 The plot itself wasn't very original. It revolves around a woman scorned and played with a rich married man. When she got impregnated by him, she was paid off by a lot of money then the rich man shared her with his friends. Quite sick if you ask me, but not as sick when she resorted to witchcraft to have her vengeance. With the aid a warlock, she had his entire family killed as well as the rich man who wronged her. She thought that ahe could inherit his estate when everyone  was gone. Unbeknowest to her the man had a first family. The story picks off when she becomes the wife of one of his sons, but when he started to suspect something's wrong, she poisons him and tries to pick off the first family one by one. I will not go into further details but in this movie you will see one of the creepiest looking child ghosts since the Locker and the Ring.

 My one complaint about the film is the screenplay. It seemed to start near the end and goes back in time as memories and part of a conversation, because of this delivery, the film ended up losing most of the suspense and creepiness it could have achieved. However, the bewitching scenes are a bit creepy, nails, blades among other things being choked up but after awhile it gets redundant. The 2 lead actresses are gorgeous, especially the villainess I hope to see her in other films. The cast all need acting lessons though.

 The dvd comes in 5.1 english dubbed but I decided to watch it in Thai as per its original audio. If you are a fan of asian horror, you may want to take a look. The lead actress/villainess is enchanting to look at. So far, the best Thai horror film I've seen is SHUTTER(ART OF THE DEVIL DOESN'T COME CLOSE). That movie creeped me out and I believe it blows away the GRUDGE and THE RING, and it takes a lot to creep me out!!

 Hopefully ART OF THE DEVIL 2 will be better. I've read the sypnosis and it looks promising.
Skip it! [2.5 stars]",1142812800,8,2075,4.246192893401015
2410066,2,B000BB18NG,"This is the Thai version of ""I Spit on Your Grave."" A woman goes after a rich man only to find herself pregnant. She blackmails him for money, which he freely pays, but then forces her to have sex with his friends...all at once. She uses magic to enact her revenge against them and the heirs of the estate of the rich man.

The present was filmed in black and white while flashbacks were in color until they came together. The story was rather bland. Sexy scenes involved close ups of sweaty skin and rice. Yum.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Brief sex. Implied rape. No nudity.",1405296000,2,576,4.4245283018867925
2410067,5,B000BB18NG,"All of the reviews are for Art of the Devil, this is Art of the Devil 2! A group of Thai kids isolated in a jungle backwater with a malevolent ""teacher"". A lot of gruesome s***t happens. I gave it five stars to get your attention. It's still pretty good, actually. No sex or T&A, but lots of gore. Easily 4 stars.

Edit: This is creepy, gruesome, and, because it's based in Asia, exotic. The basic story is that an evil teacher/witch tortures and kills her family and students. The whole experience the kids go through is part of a spell concocted by one of her victims who is one of the group. So there's a bit of a spoiler and a tease. But you won't believe the ending!

This is easily the creepiest, scariest, most gruesome thing I have ever seen.

Again, this is for Devil 2, not the original. How Amazon managed to confuse the reviews I don't know.",1398297600,2,853,4.285714285714286

2410069,4,B000BB18NG,"I liked this movie. It was good. But the audio selection was messed up. From the audio set up on the DVD menu. It does have the 5.1 and 2.0 or English dubbing, but when I clicked on Thai, the movie plays in the dubbed English. I had to press the audio button on my remote to put it in Thai.",1382486400,,290,3.7704918032786887
2410070,1,B000BB18NG,"Art of the Devil made no real sense. Okay so the father and his friends sexually abused her so she had them killed. I get that. They deserved it. That should end the revenge right there, but no, she has to kill his wife and kids as well. And she didn't even stop there as she then began to have his ex wife and her kids killed. I think that's going a little overboard with the whole revenge thing. And she wasn't even the person who did the witchcraft. She had some guys do it for her. And they never really explained why these guys were willing to kill so many people for her. I doubt she had much money but still they helped her kill one after the other in grotesque and horrifying ways like they were simply taking out the trash. I don't even know what she stood to gain from it all. The father's estate? Was it really worth that much?

I did not find this movie entertaining at all. They don't show the deaths of the guys who actually deserved it. Instead it starts with them already dead and we get to watch innocent victims die for reasons I never felt were justified. The plot wasn't thought out well. There was nothing scary about it. And the actors were mostly just annoying. Especially the female lead Nan. If I had to listen to another ten minutes of her whiny voice I think I'd stab out my eardrums with a pen. There really is no redeeming qualities to this film. Avoid.",1381190400,,1382,4.234848484848484

2410072,2,B000BB18NG,"An evil curse is placed over an affluent family after their father discards his pregnant mistress in the Thai shocker, ART OF THE DEVIL. This seemingly straightforward revenge story quickly becomes entangled in twisted timelines and nondescript characters, which makes for a very disorienting viewing experience. On top of that, it is impossible to relate to anyone in the film, between the pitiless Boom, whose attempts to extort the family fail her, and the obnoxious teenagers that fall victim to her black magic. The weakening plot really only serves as a catalyst for the gory death scenes, which are really quite tame by Western standards. Only a single scene sticks out, in which one of the sons vomits up a stomach full of bloodied razorblades. The rest of the film is easily disposable, but was popular enough in Thailand to prompt a sequel the following year.

2410073,5,B000BB18NG,"ART OF THE DEVIL is a fantastic revenge / horror film from Thailand that uses religion, superstition, and human frailty in a story of terrible betrayal, black magic, and a family curse. A woman sets out to destroy her rich ex-lover and his entire family after he uses, abuses, and humiliates her. Some of the death sequences are particularly memorable, including the vomiting of razor blades, and a hospital room floor covered in blood and eels. Very effective!
