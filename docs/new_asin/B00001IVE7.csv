8344635,3,B00001IVE7,"Overall its a good movie, however I bought it to practice my Hebrew, not to watch a quirky foreign film.  The characters are well developed, and the acting is good, but the plot is a bit wishy-washy.  They speak (Hebrew) very fast, and could only be understood completely by a native Israeli.  It is a good look into the life of a poor couple that moved from the small farming town of Afula to Tel-Aviv.  The main characters are an auto mechanic who tries to follow his dream to be a magician, and his longtime girlfriend who gets fed up with his failure.  He finally hits it big as a slapstick sidekick to his mentor.  The ending is good, but at times I was wondering if someone had accidentally taped over parts of the movie.  The director cuts to ""news"" footage of residents of Afula speaking about their hometown son who is now famous.  Overall I give it a B. It would probably get a borderline PG-13/R rating here in the states.",982800000,7,933,4.383720930232558
