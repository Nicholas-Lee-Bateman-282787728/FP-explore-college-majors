5767808,1,B00D2UMHD8,"This does not even deserve one star even though I love the Carol Burnett Show and the two shows on this DVD are her worst that I have seen.  Christmas is about Jesus, love, friends, wonderful feelings, Hope, joy and seeing the looks of children as their eyes open up to the magic of this Holy Season, but sadly, this DVD starts with ""Mama"" skit, with it's swearing, hate & yelling and it goes downhill from there.  I never cared about Alan Alda's ""acting"" and he was bad as usual. The second show with Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins brings some laughs and even with Ken Berry, the entire show is a FLOP.  Neither Carol nor Helen Reddy can sing as they show us. The extras with Jonathan Winters and Sid Caesar couldn't help this mess at all.  I wanted Christmas early as I am not expected to be here for the True event, but I surely didn't get it with this DVD. Oh well, back to the Gary Moore Christmas DVD.  +JMJ+",1381622400,4,912,4.2485549132947975
5767809,1,B00D2UMHD8,Why won't Burnett or CBS release the individual seasons.  She is the only one that makes you join a club to get her videos.  How ridiculous is that  Release them and stop the stupidity!!!!,1380844800,9,188,4.470588235294118
5767810,5,B00D2UMHD8,"My DVD came a day earlier than I expected (Thank you Amazon!).

I have already watched the entire DVD......this is a definite must for ""The Carol Burnett Show"" fans!!! There are 2 full shows (uncut) that include a Christmas themed ""Family"" Sketch (featuring Alan Alda) and a Christmas themed ""Wiggins & Tudball"" skit (one that I have never seen before!!!).  Also enjoyed the bonus sketches that feature the Charwoman singing ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" and another skit featuring a very comedic song call ""The Twelve Days AFTER Christmas"" (sung by Carol).  A very nice treat and entertaining DVD  (Highly recommend for a great stocking stuffer this Christmas!!!)

PLEASE NOTE:  This DVD features Christmas themed shows from the ACTUAL ""Carol Burnett Show"". This is the one you want to get.  Please don't confuse this with last year's 2012 release (also called ""Christmas With Carol"") but was misleading because the 2012 release only featured Carol on the ""Gary Moore Show"" that had nothing to do with ""The Carol Burnett Show""",1380672000,100,1038,5.070588235294117

5767843,3,B00D2UMHD8,"The Carol Burnett Show was a  favorite growing up, but I was disappointed in this Streaming video.  I expected Christmas skits, through the years, edited for ""the best of"" patched together.  Instead, it was just 2 Carol Burnett Shows, of which only 20% were Christmas related. I already pay $99.00 per year to Amazon for prime membership, yet It seems I am always paying extra for the quality movies I want to watch on streaming video.  And Amazon can't even guarantee that the videos will be available forever. (Contracts for streaming the movies can change) I am willing to pay 2.99 for a good movie, and on occasion $9.99 for a high quality movie such as ""Dead Poets Society"".  But these 2 shows hardly qualified for my $9.99 standards. It should have been free to prime members.  I am reading on other reviews for the DVD format, that they received bonus skits.  I did not even get the bonus skits.",1451088000,,902,4.6

It actually turns out to be just be full two episodes shot during Dec with a couple of Christmas segments. My fault for not reading the description better. However still funny stuff and worth the $6 I paid.....Except..... The horrible, ridiculous, embarrassing to white folks musical numbers. I had forgotten the Carol Burnett show, like all these variety shows of the times, had these musical numbers. To say that these parts of the show have not aged well is a gross understatement. Its even hard to believe that people back then thought these numbers where cool and entertaining.
Beyond that though, its a good set.",1419033600,4,712,4.75

The actual Carol Burnett show was filled with almost non stop laughter.  If the studios keep releasing just the junk from this show then they will continue to make just peanuts.
If any network gets the rights to air the entire series of the Carol Burnett Show then someone is going to record them and pirate them.  People will purchase them if they can get the entire series for say the average 50 dollars or less from some sellers. People are tired of waiting for the studios to release this show.  All we keep seeing is the same stupid infomercial for the series which all you get is a chosen few episodes.
My suggestion:  Release the series before everyone loses interest entirely.  There is already enough other garbage released from the last ten years that bI certainly am not buying.  Good shows are a thing of the past.  Stop releasing what is shown on tv everyday that we don't care to see.",1389312000,6,1054,4.476439790575916

5768159,5,B00D2UMHD8,"Although I enjoyed last year's DVD release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Garry-Moore-Show-Presents-A-Carol-Burnett-Christmas/dp/B008VR7U3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Garry Moore Show Presents: A Carol Burnett Christmas</a>, which featured Carol's appearances on THE GARRY MOORE SHOW, I'm glad we finally have a Christmas DVD from the real CAROL BURNETT SHOW, which ran on CBS from 1967 to 1978.  I have all of the Guthy-Renker DVDs of the show; this is the first one that I have purchased from the StarVista/Time-Life series.

Carol did not do Christmas episodes per se, but this DVD features two regular episodes with holiday sketches.  The first, from 1974, features Alan Alda (of *M*A*S*H* fame), who stars in an hilarious Family Christmas sketch, and has a surprisingly good singing voice, most notably on a duet with Carol, ""Nobody Does It Like Me.""

The second episode, from 1977, features Helen Reddy and Burnett semi-regular Ken Berry, who does a number called (what else?) ""Song And Dance Man,"" where Mr. Berry excels as usual.  There is also a Turnbull-and-Higgins Christmas sketch with Carol and Tim Conway, and a finale spoofing People Magazine, with the closing number ""Strike Up The Band.""

In addition, there are two bonus sketches:  one from 1967, which features a bungled Q&A session with Carol and Jonathan Winters (who passed away earlier this year), and a sketch with Sid Caesar and Carol, who play a bickering husband and wife on Christmas night.  The second sketch, from 1968, is Carol's hilarious spoof of ""The Twelve Days Of Christmas,"" titled ""The Twelve Days After Christmas.""  I hope that these early episodes can be made available in their entirety some day.

A must for any Carol Burnett fan.  Congratulations on winning The Mark Twain Prize at The Kennedy Center, Carol - you deserve it.",1385856000,16,1871,5.484320557491289
5768160,3,B00D2UMHD8,"This was disappointing. One of the episodes has already been released before. If you have purchased the set before in one of the previous incarnations, give this one a pass.",1385078400,,173,4.8
5768161,1,B00D2UMHD8,"I expected a lot of Christmas entertainment and it was more no-Christmas.
There was too much emphasis on guest stars and not enough Christmas skits.",1384992000,5,148,4.96
5768162,2,B00D2UMHD8,"Just in time for the holidays, Time Life Entertainment brings us this single disc release featuring two episodes from the classic Carol Burnett show plus bonus material.  One will certainly open this case with the anticipation and excitement of a Christmas morning in hopes of finding something truly special.  Unfortunately the gift garners the same disappointment as finding socks and underwear wrapped up under the tree.

The two episodes we receive were during transitional periods in the show history and thus lack the comedic chemistry the show was known for.  Lyle Waggoner may have been known more for his looks than his comedic ability, but he knew how to play a straight man and allow the funny people around him to shine.  After his departure, the show featured Harvey Korman and Vicki Lawrence as the comedic players in sketches with Carol and that is the case in the first episode on this release.  Alan Alda appears as the guest star, but the writing in this episode fails to truly allow these stars to display their comedic chops and instead leaves them chomping on scenery.

In this episode we get an enjoyable opening Q&A with audience members presenting Carol with gifts, and a young girl bursting into tears after meeting Alda.

The Christmas sketch featuring Mamas family just seems forced and tired as the writers appear desperate to find a way to work Alda in, and rely too much on facial expressions by the cast to get laughs where the script fails to provide any.

The musical number with Burnett and Alda as department store employees is pleasant and works well as a lead in to the next sketch in which the two are dating, but, the premise for the dating sketch is tired and obvious, and yields few laughs.

The New York themed finale could have been more geared towards Christmas, and Waggoner was clearly missed as Korman and Lawrence are distractingly over used.

The second episode on the release is from 1977 and features Tim Conway, who had joined the cast, along with Lawrence and guest starts Ken Berry and Helen Reddy.  Unfortunately Korman had left the show by then and thus, much like the first episode, there was clearly magic missing.

The opening Q&A is brief and awkward as Carol seems off her normal game.

The Christmas sketch with Mrs. Wiggins & Mr. Tudball is one of the more enjoyable pieces on this DVD and provides wonderful trivia as Mrs. Wiggins first name is revealed (Wanda).  Unfortunately the scene falls flat with the appearance of Mrs. Tudball (Lawrence) in an ending that is far too contrived.

Helen Reddy performs in a somewhat Christmas themed number that was far better suited for Burnett as it fails to allow Reddy to truly display her vocal skills.

A sketch with Burnett and Berry as a married couple being visited by a German representative of the water company in search of water wasters was cute at best relying on Conways accent for the majority of the laughs.

Berrys song and dance number manages to display his talents and an art form that has sadly been lost.

Two sketches loosely tied together by current events feature Lawrence as a fast talking stewardess in a one joke bit, and Conway as a Senator who took a bribe.  It is in this sketch with Conway where Korman is so clearly missed.  With Korman as the chairman of the committee this scene could have been far more enjoyable.

The Strike Up the Band finale featuring the entire cast with Berry and Reddy is enjoyable, but a Christmas theme would have seemed more appropriate.

Burnett ends the show with a song about all holidays that is certainly unique.

The Bonus material contains both hits and misses.

The appearance of Jonathan Winters makes little sense and does not belong on this release.

The Christmas Sketch with Carol and Sid Caesar should have been much funnier considering the comedic talent.
Carol singing Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas as her cleaning woman character is the best thing on the DVD and will certainly remind all of why we love her and this show, and she has fun singing The Twelve Days After Christmas in another number.

Recommendation: Perhaps this is all the Christmas material available, but, considering the show ran for twelve years, that is certainly doubtful.  Ultimately there is just not enough quality here to warrant spending money on this.  If someone gives it to you for Christmas, you can probably find the time to watch it over the course of the year since it has less than two hours of material, and then regift it the following year at your office gift exchange.  Sadly, its not worth keeping.",1384473600,3,4580,4.753476611883691

5768219,3,B00D2UMHD8,"I enjoyed the Carol Burnett Show Christmas DVD, but if you are looking for wall-to-wall Christmas sketches and music you won't find it here.  But what is here is enjoyable.

Episode One:  December 21, 1974:
Regulars: Harvey Korman, Vicki Lawrence & special guest: Alan Alda

*Q&A--this is fun because an Alan Alda fan comes up and Alan comes out and the poor girl falls apart (very funny & sweet)

*The Family Christmas Sketch:  Depends on how you feel about Eunice, Ed & Mama--it isn't exactly a heart-warming Christmas.  Alan plays Eunice's brother Larry.

*Sketch & song with Carol & Alan playing a department store wrapper & Santa dealing with customers & singing a duet of ""Nobody Does it Like Me.""

*Sketch--Morton of the Movies--Alan uses lines from an old movie to try to make the moves on Carol & she catches on(also featuring Harvey & Vicki)

*Finale--New York Medley: ""Take Me Back to Manhattan"", ""New York, New York"", ""Lullaby of Broadway"", ""Lets go Slumming on Park Avenue"", ""Manhattan"", ""In Old New York,"" ""Rose of Washington Square"", ""How About You?"" ""Lullaby of Broadway"",  ""Broadway Rythem"", ""42nd Street"",--Carol, Alan, Harvey, Vicki & singers & dancers

Verdict:  Good show, but only two Christmas themed portions--both in the first half.  I was sorry that in the finale they did a New York medley instead of a Christmas medley.

Episode Two:  December 18, 1977
Regulars:  Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway & guests: Ken Berry & Helen Reddy

*Sketch--Christmas sketch with Mrs. Wiggins & Mr. Tudball with an office visit from Mrs. Tudball (Vicki)

*Song--""Blue""--Helen Reddy (semi-Christmassy in that it is set in a toy shop & Helen appears as a kind of Raggedy Ann doll)

*Sketch--Carol & Ken Berry play a couple visited by a German water inspector (Tim)accusing them of wasting water during water crisis

*Song/dance--""Song and Dance Man""--Ken Berry with the singers & dancers

*Person's Weekly Magazine (mini-sketches)--Vicki plays a fast-talking stewardess on the Concord, Senate Ethics Committee calls witness (Ken)a lobbyist for an oil company who wants to 'clear his conscience're: payoffs paid to a senator who is on the committee (Tim),

*Musical Finale: ""Strike Up the Band""(Carol, Vicki, Helen, Ken, dancers),

*Carol thanks the Ideal Toy Company for $10,000 for distributing toys to needy childen

*Carol sings a song celebrating ALL holidays (including Christmas)

Verdict:  I actually liked this show more than the earlier one, but still not really a traditional Christmas episode--and sad that without two good singers like Ken Berry & Helen Reddy (not to mention Carol & Vicki) that they couldn't have done a Christmas song medley at some point.

Extras:
December 25, 1967
Q&A between Carol and guest Jonathan Winters (Carol wears her Christmas outfit)
Christmas sketch with Carol and Sid Caesar as a quarreling couple
Song: ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" with Carol as her charwoman character (decorating a Christmas tree)

December 30, 1968
Carol sings the comic ""The Twelve Days AFTER Christmas""

Despite Eunice's ""Merry Xmas"" apron and Ed's mile-wide red tie, there's no joy in the house once Eunice's younger brother Larry (Alan Alda) and Mama arrive.
On a happier note, Carol and Alan Alda find peace amid the commercial holiday hustle and bustle with their charming  Nobody Does It Like Me duet.

Show #1113, Original Air Date: December 18, 1977
Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins awkwardly observe the ""mistletoe"" tradition. Tudball's wife, played by Vicki Lawrence, pays a surprise visit to the office and catches them with their guards down, so to speak.
Vicki and Tim Conway carefully measure Carol for a hilarious Christmas present and Carol's concluding song celebrates Christmas and all holidays of the year, large and small.

5768221,5,B00D2UMHD8,"Carol Burnett has received the Mark Twain Award for humor (Oct. 2013), among many honors. This holiday-related DVD collects two full Carol Burnett shows (Dec. 1974 & Dec. 1977) and is highly entertaining reminder of why she was one of the first women to be able to carry a full television hour of humor and song. Harvey Korman and Guest Alan Alda spar with Carol in the 1974 show in several skits and Tim Conway and guest Ken Barry shine in the 1977 show. The Higgins family Christmas skit from 1974 (featuring Vicki Lawrence) is both funny and at times too-close-to-the-truth in portraying the tension of the holidays. I like that about Carol Burnett's brand of humor: she finds the laughs, but doesn't tip into easy sentimentality. My favorite skit is the 1977 Tim Conway bit as a near-fascist water meter man seeking out ""water wasters"" at all costs. Conway also has a great bit as a Senator squirming during a hearing on bribery. Good stuff and a nice look at Watergate-related humor from that era. Some might find the Broadway-style songs a bit stiff today. I actually enjoy them and clearly Carol (who became a star on Broadway first) loves singing and dancing for her adoring audience (and who knew Alan Alda was such a strong singer?). This will be a welcome diversion this year during the holidays.",1382400000,5,1307,4.711790393013101
