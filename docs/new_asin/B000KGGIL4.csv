2689853,5,B000KGGIL4,"I can't believe that the final season of the Golden Girls will be released 3 months from the previous set. It usually takes six months between releases. My review is premature. I just pre-ordered this set. However, I am familiar with the episodes that previous reviewers have summarized. Therefore, I know that I am going to love this set as I have loved all the others.",1164153600,,370,4.621212121212121

2689855,5,B000KGGIL4,"Finally we have come to the Seventh and Final Season of The Golden Girls! I have been waiting to own all of these great seasons and after this release I will finally get my chance. This is another great season that features more laughs, jokes, silliness, and the great friendship that each of the ladies had shared. This was a great and sad season in my opinion. Because Bea Arthur who played Dorothy felt that seven years was enough for her and she decided to leave the show. I wanted to cry right along with them on the last episode where Dorothy leaves to be with Blanche's Uncle Lucas. I wish Bea Arthur would have stayed just a little while longer because I could have watched more episodes of this wonderful show!

Estelle Gettys character Sophies goal that evening is to fill a 3 wish prophecy before midnight. Both Barbara & her sister are pitted against each other in Sophies practical joke making this episode a corkscrew of highball comedy and high talent from a full cast of actors and actresses. Just a few years from Kristys departure from acting makes this excellent episode another one of Kristy McNichols now cherished performances.

Then the show started showing in re-runs and it turned out that you really didn't loose a favorite family member...you could still see the girls, in fact you could see them even more often.  Unfortunately the networks that showed the re-runs were cutting them up, removing...I guess...lines that might seem risque.  But they aren't.....

While the special features are a bit light for the final season, it is better than nothing (the treatment a lot of show's receive). The quality of the writing and superb performances never once flags, as fans are treated to another slew of interesting storylines and riotous Bea Arthur deadpan stares. The image/sound quality are about what you'd expect from a show in this era shot on videotape. Yes, rather than being filmed, it was recorded on analog tape so HD remastering is impossible sadly. But, they did what they could to clean up the picture and it turns out rather nicely. Enjoy the uncut unedited episodes presented in the final season over and over and relive the magic of the series's poignant finale. This show doesn't whimper out it's final year like many sitcoms...the girls have a respectable final year that every TV collector MUST OWN!",1425427200,3,972,4.757396449704142

Three widows and one divorcee assemble under one roof to co-exist with lots of laughter and questionable behavior, at times.  The show was set in Miami, Florida.

""Picture this"" as Sophia would say while sitting around the kitchen table.  And, a story came to life - many times while eating cheesecake.  Sophia (the mother of  Dorothy) was a resident in the Shady Pines Retirement Home before she came to live with the other three women.  Dorothy is just trying to find anyone that she can be comfortable with and this presents a real challenge.  Rose is from St. Olaf and her humor is that of the simple type but hilarious.  And, what about Blanche? A belle from the South with a desire for the other sex that burns with intensity on the TV.

Am sure everyone knows the real names of the stars but will still add them below.  (Plus, one perhaps unknown fact for each one)

Estelle Getty - Sophia - died at the age of 88. - Suffered from stage fright.

Bea Arthur - Dorothy - died at the age of 86. - Hated cheesecake.  Also, was a member of the USMC Women's Reserve before WW II and served as both a typist and a truck driver.

Rue McClanahan - Blanche - died at the age of 76. - Was able to keep her wardrobe from the show.

Betty White - Rose - still going strong at 92 and winning Emmys for new shows. - originally cast as Blanche.

All in all, when I look back over the shows I enjoyed during the 1980's and early 1990's, this one comes to mind.  It contained the ups and downs of life, humor as well as some sadness, and just a classic depiction of life in the US with four gals without partners.",1416873600,2,1753,4.289634146341464

Although a touching and hilarious season like the rest, with each episode in season 7 the closer you get to the end the more heartbreaking it is and you can see it within the cast too.

The finale 2 episodes are such a befitting way to end one of the best shows ever",1314921600,,458,4.204545454545454

The dvds are to light weight, thats the flaw.  In fairness once the dvds begin to play the picture is of the highest quality. I have always been satisfied with amazon products. I purchased other dvds from them, so the fault lies with the producers of this dvd.  Please take a loss and remake the golden girls series on a better heavy duty disc.  You will make all your money back, Golden Girls is loved by millions. I won't purchase anymore Golden Girls, i'll have to use the portable dvd to watch the 7th series.

2690091,5,B000KGGIL4,"As much as I love the Golden Girls, it ended at just the right time before it became a tired old, shadow of what it used to be. Although many of episodes have their humor including the two-part Monkey Show where Stan uses a traffic cone monkey to get over Dorothy and then sleeps with Dorothy's visiting sister Gloria who has lost her money. Another wonderful episode is Goodbye Mr. Gordon where Dorothy's old high school teacher from New York visits starting a relationship with Dorothy. Meanwhile Rose becomes an associate producer for ""Wake Up Miami"" and convinces Dorothy and Blanche to appear on a show about Lesbian lovers of Miami.

This seventh season of the Golden Girls is not a bad season, but it relies a lot on two part episodes and there where more episodes where the jokes or ideas where just lost on me like A Midwinter Nights Dream where Blanche throws a Moonlight Madness Party where all the guys are fawning all over Dorothy and ignoring Blanche and Miles decides to marry Rose to take advantage of a prize Rose won. The final episode still brings tears to my eyes and I rarely watch it because saying goodbye to the Golden Girls was like saying goodbye to a member of the family. One thing I will comment on about the DVD's is the lack of extras. It doesn't seem right that the show was on for seven years and all we could muster was one feature on looking back at the show. Still it's a fitting end to the show that we loved.",1276214400,3,1446,4.415730337078652

2690095,4,B000KGGIL4,"I hadn't seen Golden Girls on T.V but accidently started watching repeats last year on Hallmark channel. I finally wanted to know how it ended so ordered the last season. Although I had seen some of the episodes it was great to watch them in chronological order and see how it all came to an end.

If you like the Golden Girls show you will think the last season is terrific with the same great writing and sense of humor.

2690097,5,B000KGGIL4,"Guaranteed to make you laugh!  The final season of this great show keeps the laughs coming that have existed in the past six seasons.  The show went out on top with a finale that is both funny and touching, and a bit of a surprise.  This is well worth the investment to watch over and over again.",1253232000,,296,4.157894736842105
2690098,5,B000KGGIL4,"The seventh year of ""The Golden Girls"" would be their last as Bea Arthur informed the network and the producers that she was leaving the series. I believe Bea knew there were simply no more good stories to be told as the series became old and tiresome both in story content and direction at the beginning of the sixth year. In this 22 episode boxset the best show is the finale entitled ""One Flew Out Of The Cockoo's Nest"". One of the roomates gets married leaving behind the other three. That one episode brought the series back to its zenith resembling the shows from the first four years. There is great comedy, wonderful sadness, and most of all the actresses look like they were enjoying themselves with good material, although they knew it was the end. Important to note too is that NBC decided to air ""The Golden Girls"" an hour earlier on Saturday nights beginning in September, 1991 which was a death nell for the show as it finished the year at #30. The series, however, shot back into the top five with the final episode, a feat it last accomplished two years prior. The ending is one of the best in television history. Stupidly, the producers decided to bring the remaining ladies back in a sitcom called ""Golden Palace"" in the fall of 1992 on another network and new night. The series was a total failure and ""The Golden Girls"" disappeared forever with the exception of Estelle Getty who brought her character to NBC's ""Empty Nest"". Thankfully, however, we can enjoy all ""The Golden Girls"" episodes ( seven boxsets worth) on DVD format, uncut and without commercials. ""The Golden Girls"", after having 180 shows produced, will live on as being one of the greatest sitcoms in broadcast history.",1249948800,3,1704,4.683333333333334

2690101,5,B000KGGIL4,"Even after seven seasons, the Golden Girls are full of fresh and familiar laughs in this final DVD box set.

Particularly memorable and hilarious episodes include ""The Case of the Libertine Belle,"" where the girls take part in a murder-mystery weekend...and fear someone may actually be dead. There's also ""Hey, Look Me Over,"" where Rose finds some old photos of Charlie, and is under the impression that her late husband once knew Blanche, as well as ""The Pope's Ring,"" where Sophia is dead set on meeting the pontiff when he makes a visit to Miami.

There are also a few moments of poignancy and new understanding. In ""Room 7,"" Blanche must face the razing of her grandmother's home, where she spent countless holidays as a child; and in ""Beauty and the Beast,"" Blanche and her granddaughter learn a few things about one another when Blanche insists on entering the little girl in a beauty pageant against her will.

Notable guest stars include Leslie Nielsen (as a love interest of Dorothy's) and Alex Trebek as himself.

The season -- and the series -- is wrapped up with a feature that includes commentary and clips.

It's hard to let such a great series go, but at least the girls left us with seven wonderful seasons, full of laughs and friendship for the ages.",1246924800,,1268,4.719457013574661
2690102,5,B000KGGIL4,"The gals go out with a bang in this seventh and last season of the Golden Girls. Produced by the creative Marc Cherry, the season begins after Dorothy called off her second wedding to Stan.

Along the way, Blanche tries to seduce a priest, and helps a baseball player find his feminine side. Rose is joined by her lover, Miles, and Dorothy's Uncle Angelo makes a return visit. Sophia is as witty and sarcastic as ever.

This collection contains 26 episodes on three discs. Several well known guests include Alex Trebbek, Leslie Nielsen, Merv Griffin, and Peter  Graves.

The ending is a tear-jerker, but there are many laughs along the way. The seventh season seemed to be the best of the series. Thankfully, we can relive those days anytime we want with this hilarious collection.

It was certainly a one-of-a-kind show back when it began airing in the mid-eighties, and in my opinion, still is. To me, no other show has ever quite measured up to this one, including 'Friends.' If you don't have any of 'The Golden Girls' DVDs, or watch them regularly on T.V.,  you really don't know what you're missing.

The extras on the DVD include interviews with surviving cast members. These legendary actresses share personal memories from their experience in the show. Their stories are funny and touching, and a great addition to the set. A must-have for any Golden Girls fan, as well as any fan of good comedy. The entire series is highly rewatchable.

I am a MASSIVE fan of the Golden Girls and have enjoyed every minute of the first 6 Seasons, I just didn't want them to end. By purchasing this final Season, it meant that there would be no more Seasons to collect and watch. I hated the thought of this. This is without doubt the BEST comedy show ever and unfortunately now I have seen them all. It's SAD even though I still enjoy them. But you never know, they might release the Golden Palace too.

This is a superb Season. I would recommend it to anyone. The BEST show ever. There will never EVER be another comedy like it.",1224115200,,701,4.2706766917293235

2690113,5,B000KGGIL4,"The last season of ""The Golden Girls"" is the funniest of the seven years that the show existed.  The funniest elements of the show are the derogatory remarks between the roomates, Dorothy and Sophia's relationship, and Sophia's character in itself.  All of these elements were at their peak in the final season.  Sophia and Dorothy's fight over the will, the conflict over the nurse Dorothy hired to care for her after an injury, Stan's companionship with a...well, a stuffed monkey on a traffic cone.  The final episode is one of the 5 best episodes in the history of the series.  It makes you wish that they had continued for another few years because they seemed to have reached the pinnacle of the show at this point.  In the end, the 7 years and the hundreds of episodes are more than enough to make this series one of the funniest, most unique sitcoms in the history of television, regardless of gender or age.",1214870400,,916,4.6234567901234565

Sorrow, because this was the last and final season. I don't think there will ever be another 4 women sitcom, that will be able to live up to these four. The ever so dim witted Rose, the sexy but Slutty Blanche, the dateless, Educated Dorothy and the ever so wise, flatulent and Fiesty Sophia. I would recommend this DVD to the young and old.

Other episodes in this season sees the girls go on a murder mystery weekend where Dorothy becomes a classsic Jessica Fletcher, Blanche is at the centre of attention again, Rose is transparent in terms of where she comes from, and Sophia is well...just Sophia!!  In seven wonderfull years the girls finally come together and show us that even though they don't always get along, deep down they really love each other.

Not to mention topics that weren't talked about much back in the 80's, like ladies in their 50's (and Sophia in her 80's) still enjoying a sex life!  Nothing vulgar like nowadays...but in a humorous, healthy way. While sad to have received my last season on DVD, I can now enjoy any episode whenever I need a laugh over Rose's dumb St. Olaf jokes, joy by watching Dorothy and Sophia's heartfelt mother/daughter relationship, and Blanche, enjoying the company of her ""gentlemen friends""...

While the last episode does not close any doors or feel like another episode could never be, the knowledge that this is the end will bring a tear to the eye of a true fan. This season is a must-have for the collector to complete their collection, but for those just looking for some good Golden Girls episodes I recomend seasons 1-3 for non-stop laughs and the occasional heart wrenching reality checks.",1175126400,,721,4.776

There are no more episodes to wait for, no more new moments on which to dote, at least not for this sitcom.  I will miss them dearly.  The ""Girls"" and I have been together for several years.  Seen hard times, good, but hard times pass, yet with some laughs, thanks to them.  That's the great thing about good serial television, the characters are built to last.  Their details, their personalities refuse to diminish.  Have you ever noticed Dorothy had a new hairdo every season?  Constantly searching, dissatisfied, scurulous Dorothy.  Bea, we'll miss you Bea, and those collars.  And Rose's hair?  Always the same.  Good old faithful naivete.  Can't squash that.  And Blanche, the harlot, who doesn't love unbridled vanity.  Her hair changed, but for style's sake, I'd say.  She was the outward looking of the group, shallow, but hence her myopia became all the more hilarious.  Ever notice the table only had three chairs?  The brass moulds change location in the kitchen from episode to episode.  And Sophia.  The wisdom of the group.  Forget about her hair, it was a wig!  In reality, she's the youngest of the group.  Her sickness in ""real"" life, alzheimers, a bitter reminder that the show did indeed capture those most precious ""golden"" years in the lives of four great actors.  They were bold in the subjects they tackled... AIDS (season 5?), immigration (season 2), transvestite siblings (season 6), slum lords (season 7), homosexuality (several different episode), this show got around.  It's worth perusing all seven dvd's if you can.  Where are they now?  ""Picture it... Sicily...""",1175040000,3,1700,4.925531914893617

I remember watching when it was on originally and thinking it was so funny.  But I really got hooked on the reruns years ago when tragedy struck my family.  I started watching it at 11 pm instead of the news.  I found the humor to be so helpful when winding down from the day.  Now that I have my own dvds (I have them all), I no longer have to catch it on TV (it's not on at 11 now anyway) and I love that.  I watch one every night before going to sleep, it's a great destressor and the jokes never get old.  I have some episodes that are favorites but really I love them all.  The writing on this show is fabulous, the acting great and the humor is timeless. I am nearly done watching this 7th season dvd, but--no matter!  I'll just start all over again at the beginning!  It's fun to see how each 'girl' settles into her role (Dorothy and Sophia seem to change the most.)  This review is for all the seasons.  They're all superb.  It will always be my favorite TV show.

2690153,5,B000KGGIL4,"The last season of The Golden Girls arrived on DVD this past Tuesday. Now I can finally retire my remaining VHS taped episodes of the show.

I became a die-hard Golden Girls fan after discovering the show at the beginning of February 1987 while channel surfing. The ""Bedtime Story"" episode was on that night. It was already a few minutes into the episode when I tuned in as Dorothy, and then Blanche, dove into Sophia's bed because there was a cold snap in Miami and Sophia was the only one who had an electric blanket. Since I had never seen The Golden Girls before, I initially gave the episode my ""5-minute rule"", which meant if the show didn't interest me in the next 5 minutes, I was onto the next channel. The moment Blanche said, ""Listen, did you hear that sound?"" and Sophia replied, ""Yeah, and as long as I'm in my own bed I'll do what I want!"", I burst out hysterically laughing and it instantly hooked me in, so I stuck around for the rest of the episode. When the episode ended, I thought it was pretty good so I decided I would check out next week's episode, which I did, and the one after that and so on. By the time I saw the fourth episode, I fell in love with the show. Over the next five years or so, I never missed a Golden Girls episode. Thank heavens for VCRs as well as for repeats and for syndication later on to help me catch up on all the prior episodes I missed.

What I loved - and still love - about The Golden Girls was that it was unafraid to tackle the more important social and controversial issues such as being gay, HIV/AIDS, aging, elder care, dating, loneliness, poverty, discrimination, dying, assisted suicide, relationships, teenage pregnancy, friendship, etc. The show handled these issues with intelligence, wit, and above all, with humor. Every facet of the show worked: from the first-rate cast, to the top-notch writers and production crew (including Marc Cherry, who would go on to create ""Desperate Housewives"" in 2004), and finally to the creative and brilliant executive producers, Tony Thomas, Paul Junger Witt and Susan Harris, the same trio who gave us ""Soap"", the hilarious, ground-breaking comedy show from the late 1970's.

Although the Golden Girls' last season wasn't their best compared to previous seasons, it was the most personal to me for two reasons:

1) A friend of mine got a bit part in the ""Rose: Portrait of a Woman"" episode. My friend was one of the salesmen whom Dorothy was trying to teach. Although my friend didn't say a word in that episode, he did get a two-second close-up. Not long before NBC aired the episode, my friend had the opportunity to preview it and later told everyone to watch it. When I asked him about the close-up, he said, ""Don't blink or you'll miss it!"" We both had a good laugh.

2) My friend arranged for tickets for my partner-at-the-time and I to be in the studio audience for taping part one of the series finale ""One Flew Out of the Cuckoo's Nest.""

As Sophia would tell it, Picture it: Hollywood. It's early Friday night on March 27, 1992. A handsome young man and his partner arrive at the Ren-Mar studios for a taping of The Golden Girls. Once they give their tickets to the guy at the door, they run through the back of the sound-stage like a bunch of howler monkeys and grab the best seats they could find in the audience gallery, next to the roped-off VIP seats of course! A stand-up comic walks through the audience gallery who greets the incoming crowd and warms them up for tonight's taping with a few jokes and funny stories. Shortly afterward, each crew and cast member is introduced, along with special guest, Leslie Neilson, who played the part of Blanche's Uncle Lucas. Everyone gets a great round of applause and then they all take their places for the taping. Bea, Rue and Leslie disappear out of the audience's sight. Betty and Estelle sit at the kitchen table holding their coffee mugs. The excitement mounts and grows. Finally, we heard ""...and action!"" from the episode's director.

For the next few hours, I was in Seventh Heaven! I couldn't believe I was there and this was actually happening. To have had the opportunity to see a Golden Girls episode taped live was a dream come true and a moment in my life I'll always treasure. Every time I watch this episode, I can still see myself back on that sound-stage, sitting in the audience gallery, watching as they taped it, and getting the true, full perspective of everything that was going on, which fans rarely, if ever, get the chance to see. Bea, Betty, Estelle and Rue were consummate professionals. A comedy show is very hard work to pull off successfully week-after-week. Nevertheless, the girls looked like they were enjoying themselves and they made it look so easy.

They shot each scene multiple times in order to get the best comedic timing from the cast and the best response from the audience. They also shot all the scenes in the same sequential order they appeared in the episode. One scene was adjusted in-between takes to get a better response from the audience, which they used in the episode.

I came away with a newfound appreciation for the show when the taping ended. Now every time I watch a Golden Girls episode, I think back on my experience and realize all the hard work they put into every scene.

I wasn't aware at the time this would be the last episode taped in front of a live studio audience or that it was the series finale. My friend who appeared on the show told me they shot the second part of the finale on a closed, private set. Apart from the cast and crew, the only other people allowed in the studio were former crew members who had previously worked on the show, anyone who ever appeared on the show (no matter how small your part was), and those who were on the VIP-invite list. Of course, my friend went.

**** Begin Spoiler Alert ****

Sadly, looking back in retrospect, there were a couple of moments during the taping I attended that unfortunately was an omen of things to come for Estelle Getty:

(a) During the first take of the scene where Blanche, Rose and Sophia are in the living room and Dorothy emerges from her bedroom to tell them about her date the night before with Blanche's Uncle Lucas at ""Don's Crab House"", Estelle blanked out and missed her cue to deliver the scene's punch line: ""Ingrid Bergman had Paris, my pussycat has crabs"". When you watch this scene in the episode, Bea is sitting on the couch and the cameras zoom in on her face. Betty and Rue are also sitting on the couch on either side of Bea looking at her. Estelle is sitting a chair looking down at something in her lap. The cameras eventually zoom in on Estelle to deliver the scene's punch line. However, just as the scene's first take got underway, instead of looking down, Estelle started looking in our direction and she was squinting, as if she was looking for someone or something. Since this was the first take, we thought this was in the script and didn't realize anything was wrong. Some in the audience started giggling and laughing ""at the wrong moment"" because of this. The director obviously heard everything and saw what Estelle was doing, which prompted him to say ""Cut!"". Taping stopped for a few minutes so Estelle could go over the script and she nailed the scene in all proceeding takes. I talked with my friend who appeared on the show about this later on and he told me the teleprompters with the cast's lines were located under the audience gallery, so in all likelihood, Estelle was trying to find the teleprompter with her lines so she could catch her line but it never happened in time. Sources close to the show later revealed Estelle was in the early stages of dementia at the time.

(b) During the scene where Estelle emerges from the kitchen dressed in a ""Mammy"" outfit, &agrave; la ""Gone with the Wind"", it was obvious to us Estelle was getting tired. Well over two hours of taping elapsed by the time they shot this scene. That, combined with the make-up applied to Estelle to give her an older appearance in every episode, the outfit she was wearing, including the bandanna and wig over her head, and all the time she spent under the spotlights, you could see it was getting to her. Estelle nailed the scene's first take, but she had trouble listing what they were supposed to have for ""dinner"" in the proceeding takes (""...corn pone, succotash, collard greens, and thems just the appetizers..."") Estelle became more flustered and flubbed her lines in each proceeding take. Taping had to stop again for a few minutes so she could have a break. In the end, they decided not to do another take of the scene and used the first take in the episode. The next scene when Estelle comes back into the living room, ringing the triangle and said ""Cocktails!"" was her first scene after the break.

**** End Spoiler Alert ****

Although The Golden Girls ended its run on May 9, 1992, it's still sorely missed, but I'm grateful for the DVDs and for the fact I can usually catch an episode via syndication just about anytime. The show was truly ahead of its time. The cast had a wonderful chemistry and the entire crew were superb. In hindsight, I believe Bea Arthur made a very difficult decision, but ultimately, a very wise decision to leave the show.

In my book, The Golden Girls was one of the best comedy shows of the 1980's and, IMO, one of the best comedy shows ever on television.

Thank you for the laughter, the tears and for the joy you gave me. Thank you for entertaining me, and most of all, thank *YOU* for being a friend!

Update #1: July 22, 2008 -- Estelle Getty passed away early this morning at her Hollywood home at age 84 of Lewy body dementia. The world has lost one of its greatest comedians. Thank you Estelle for giving me some of the best laughs I ever had. It was a pleasure to see you perform as Sophia in person and I'll always cherish those memories. Rest in Peace Estelle. ""Good night ma!""

Update #2: April 25, 2009 -- Bea Arthur passed away at age 86 of cancer. From her Broadway roles as Lucy Brown in Threepenny Opera, Yente the Matchmaker in Fiddler on the Roof, and Vera Charles in Mame, to her TV roles as Maude Finley and Dorothy Zbornak, she was a remarkable actress and singer. She will be missed. Rest in Peace Bea!

Update #3: June 3, 2010 -- Rue McClanahan passed away at age 76 of a stroke. We've lost another great actress. Rue had quite an impressive acting career, starting with off-Broadway roles in 1957 and later on Broadway in 1969. Along the way, Rue also performed in a few movies in the 60's and early 70's. On TV, Rue did a guest appearance on a 1972 episode of All In The Family that ultimately lead to her role as Vivian Harmon on Maude working with Bea Arthur from 1972 through 1978. She would continue working on TV, performing the role of Aunt Fran on Mama's Family working with Betty White for the first two seasons, the Golden Girls, her guest appearances on Empty Nest and Nurses as her Golden Girls character Blanche, and reviving her character Blanche on the short-lived Golden Girls spin-off, Golden Palace. She returned to Broadway in 2005 as Madame Morrible in Wicked, and was back on TV in 2008 as Peggy Ingram on the Sordid Lives TV series. Rue also fought and beat breast cancer in 1997. Rest in Peace Rue!

Update #4: November 28, 2010 -- Leslie Neilson, who played Blanche's Uncle Lucas in the Golden Girls two-part series finale, passed away at age 84 from complications of pneumonia. Leslie originally started out as a serious actor, with his best role as the captain of an overturned ocean liner in the 1972 disaster movie, ""The Poseidon Adventure."" He was known for his sense of humor and as a prankster, which was never explored until the movie ""Airplane!"" was released in 1980 and became a huge hit. Leslie continued with comedic roles as the accident-prone detective Frank Drebin in ""The Naked Gun"" movies. Rest in Peace Leslie!

Update #5: June 3, 2011 -- Andrew Gold, the man who composed the Golden Girl's theme song, ""Thank You for Being a Friend"", passed away at age 59 of a heart attack exactly one year after Rue's passing.

Update #6: March 23, 2016 -- Tom Whedon, who became a Golden Girls producer in 1989 and also wrote several Golden Girls episodes, passed away at age 83. Whedon got his start writing for the childrens series Captain Kangaroo in 1955. Years later, he became the head writer for another popular children's show, The Electric Company, which premiered in 1971 and won an Emmy in 1973. In-between those two shows, he wrote for series and specials starring Alan King and Mike Douglas as well as for The Dick Cavett Show. In the late 1970's, he wrote for the CBS show Alice and then landed his first producing gig on Season 2 of ABCs Soap spinoff Benson. Whedon wrote more than two dozen episodes of the 1985-89 syndicated workplace comedy Its a Living before joining The Golden Girls.",1173657600,6,12912,4.555603448275862

From the recent pictures, Season 7, I am upset that it will be in BLACK. I truly hope this is a stock photo and not how the Last and Final Box set will look.  I find it an insult to the show and the humour that is contained in each episode.  Black is such a bleak and ugly color.  All other DVD Episodes are housed in a colorful and cheery cover.  I think the black is a poor homage to the greatest show in Television history.  Think about Blanche, she wouldn't even wear black to funeral... RED has never been used for a Golden Girls Box Set color.

Anyone that is thinking of buying this DVD collection...DO IT! Believe me you will not regret it.",1167091200,13,633,3.9147286821705425
2690165,5,B000KGGIL4,"One reason to look forward to the Season 7 DVD would be the ""extra"" footage that was aired during the end credits of this season (i.e., an additional 30 seconds of funny moments).  One example--in the episode where Rose has boudoir photos made for Miles, we see her actual photo shoot at the end of the episode where she is wearing a flannel nightgown.  Lifetime and other networks on which the GG's have been syndicated edited these out!  Looking forward to February...",1165449600,7,470,4.7073170731707314
2690166,4,B000KGGIL4,"At long last, the seventh and final season of ""The Golden Girls"" will finally be out on DVD. It's been great watching the first six seasons of this truly wonderful sitcom on DVD, shown just like it did when it first aired on NBC. True, there are a couple of episodes from seasons four, five, and six that featured some brief editing while seasons one, two, and three were pretty much edit free. The brief editing was a little disappointing, but nothing like the hack job that Lifetime has done to the episodes that have aired on the cable network for years.

SEASON SEVEN (1991-92)

Season Seven of ""The Golden Girls"" is just a notch below Season Six. Season Six was a pretty good season, though not quite as good as the first five seasons. Season Seven was in my opinion the weakest season of the show's seven year run, but that doesn't make it a completely bad season. There were episodes that made me laugh out loud; there were episodes that were marginally funny; and there were episodes that weren't as funny as they should've been. But the show made a very strong comeback to end the series with the last two episodes: the next-to-last episode (a two-parter) and of course the final one hour episode that ended the series' seven year run.

The best episodes of Season Seven include: the girls going on a murder mystery weekend and Dorothy becoming a detective when a real murder occurs and Blanche is the prime suspect; Dorothy hiring a nurse to care for Sophia while Blanche enters her granddaughter into a kids beauty pageant; Stan going into therapy in trying to help him forget about Dorothy; a hurricane hitting Miami while Dorothy's sister Gloria visits; the girls traveling to Atlanta so that Blanche can make an attempt to save her grandmother's plantation; Sophia starts to date a man she met through the personals column only to be distracted by his sister who goes with them everywhere on their dates; Dorothy starts dating one of her high school teachers, while she and Blanche go on a talk-show that Rose is working for to talk about what it's like living together as roommates, only to find out at the beginning of the show that they are mistaken as lesbians, which infuriates them in the process; Dorothy trying to get on the game show ""Jeopardy!""; and Blanche inviting Dorothy out for a night on the town at Blanche's favorite bar, and Dorothy becoming the center of attention with her terrific singing talent.

And of course there are those final two episodes, which work brilliantly not just for the laughs, but for the drama too. The two-part next-to-last episode, titled ""Home Again, Rose"" is an episode that combines big laughs with high drama. In this episode, Rose suffers a heart attack that requires serious open heart surgery. It's one of the most seriously dramatic episodes of ""The Golden Girls"", but it does contain some upbeat hilarious moments. The high comic point of the episode: Rose's dream that she, Dorothy, and Blanche all have their heads frozen. This scene is a comic masterpiece as the three ladies look absolutely ridiculous with their heads sticking up through the kitchen table simultaneously. And then there's the final episode: ""One Flew Out of the Cuckoo's Nest"", in which Dorothy finds true love with Blanche's Uncle Lucas (played by Leslie Nielsen), and in the end decides to marry him, which in the process breaks up the old gang. The final scene of ""The Golden Girls"" is so touching that it brought a tear to my eye when it aired back on May 9, 1992. It was a wonderful ending to a wonderful show.

Before the beginning of the seventh season of ""The Golden Girls"", Beatrice Arthur announced that the seventh season would be her last. She apparently had had enough, and wanted to move on to other things. One major change the show had to endure for Season Seven was a new time slot. For its first six seasons ""The Golden Girls"" aired on NBC in the same time slot: Saturday nights - 9 p.m. Eastern/8 p.m. Central, and all six seasons the show finished each season in the Nielsen Top 10. For Season Seven, ""The Golden Girls"" continued to air on Saturday nights, but got moved up an hour to 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central. This move backfired, and the show fell out of the Nielsen Top 10 for the first time in the show's history. As a result, the show ended after its seventh season. But it didn't end for Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty. They went on to reprise their roles in the ""Golden Girls"" sequel show ""The Golden Palace.""

For its final season, ""The Golden Girls"" didn't fare well at the Emmys. It only received three nominations for its last season, and for the first and only time it did not receive a nomination as Best Comedy Series. Betty White and Estelle Getty were nominated again as Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. White and Getty were nominated for all seven seasons. The other nomination it got for Season Seven was for a technical category which it won. So for its seven seasons ""The Golden Girls"" finished with a total of 68 Emmy nominations and 11 Emmy wins. Very impressive.

""The Golden Girls"" always has and always will be my favorite show. Some great shows have preceded it (""Soap"", ""All in the Family""); other great shows have followed it (""Desperate Housewives"", ""House""). But nothing will ever top ""The Golden Girls"". It's the best TV show ever made.",1165363200,51,5370,4.682203389830509
2690167,5,B000KGGIL4,"Soon, I will be able to complete my entire set of the GG's. What can you say about such a remarkable 7-year series. Myself and many, many others are amazed that we can watch these over and over and they are still great! I never tire of the comedy that also exposes many emotions and makes daily life a struggle or a triumph. The writers on this series were simply ""the best"". Incredibly, every episode has some really funny remark, facial expression or sarcastic remark. The GG's seemed like our relatives--our friends who we got to know very well. They embodied every kind of personality...each different, but all congruent. It's simply perfection--the best!",1165190400,3,659,4.84070796460177
2690168,5,B000KGGIL4,"What can I say? Too bad we can't give it more than 5 stars!! I am so very glad the release of the final season is coming quickly. We own all 6 seasons so far and continue to watch them everyday in re-runs.

A special note to all of you true Golden friends.

Take close attention in the final episode when Dorothy marries Lucas. the ending credits is a gem which has been edited these days on TV. We get to see the classic closing piece (which I am sure most of you remember) of the picture Rose took and it lies on the table developing, our girls, cheesecake and all.

The perfect ending to a special and most beloved show.

Peace.",1164931200,17,631,4.147540983606557
