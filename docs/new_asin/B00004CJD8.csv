7920073,1,B00004CJD8,This dvd would not play in either of my dvd players. The fine print on the back cover reads DVD5.  If this means Region 5 then the dvd is only playable in Eastern Europe!  Unfortunately I didn't get around to playing it until after the return window closed.,1398124800,,257,4.333333333333333
7920074,5,B00004CJD8,"Like one of the other reviewers I had been searching for this film for years. I do wish that I had noticed that it was in PAL, not NTSC, but never mind, I was still able to view it on my PC.  I have loved Nigel Hawthorne (as an actor) for many years: Yes Minister, Yes Prime Minister, The Madness of King George, et al: it's so sad that he has passed.

I have met and spoken to a few London cabbies who all said that the film was true to life and they remember their first Knowledge all too well.  They still have to take the Knowledge every year until they have been in the business for a while then it stretches out to doing it every few years.

Nigel Hawthorne is magic; his cynical, biting, witty behavior makes you feel so sorry for the trainees, and then right at the end we see the reason for all of this.  If you can understand English spoken with a London accent you'll find that the humor is timeless, the trials and tribulations are so real and the end results are so satisfying.  This is a film you'll go back to time and time again.",1354233600,,1045,4.098039215686274
7920075,5,B00004CJD8,"I remember watching this on TV many many years ago.  It made an impact back then, but I was slightly tentative as to whether the rose coloured glasses might have applied.  I didn't need to worry.  Nigel Hawthorne is probably even better than I remember (his induction speech to the new recruits is magnificent), but what also shines are the remaining cast, the direction, and of course the brilliant writing.

The packaging of the DVD is possibly another matter, but its ultimately irrelevant given the quality of the show.

In my view, still the best character based TV movie ever made.",1294185600,,587,4.772277227722772
