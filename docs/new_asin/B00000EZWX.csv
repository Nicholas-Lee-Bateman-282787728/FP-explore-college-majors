3418903,2,B00000EZWX,"This version is 10 minutes shorter than it should be. The cut happens in the first third of the film and eliminates some of the storyline, so not too happy being charged to rent an inferior product.",1370995200,,198,4.378378378378378

In addition, this is the first time Rainbow Over Texas has been released in its full length uncut running time of 65 minutes.  Other  releases found on video have been the 54 minute TV versions.  This 1946  film is from the era when both Dale Evans and ""Gabby"" Hayes  co-starred with Roy.

8270842,4,B00000EZWX,"Cute example of the genre with all the necessary elements, including some great folksy/country songs.  It's worth seeing the film just for the hat that Dale is wearing in the final scene, but all of the costumes are great.  For those who are Roy Rogers fans, you might be interested in this tidbit: I used to work with a relative of the man who was Trigger's trainer.  Apparently, Trigger was indeed considered by all who worked with him to be a remarkably intelligent and talented horse, one considered unique by animal trainers in the industry.",1448841600,,546,4.726315789473684
