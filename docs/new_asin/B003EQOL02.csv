8395582,5,B003EQOL02,Although i haven't purchased the video I've seen the series on gogoanime which is a terrific sight to watch great anime series such as the Heartcatch Precure. The only thing that i wish is that they had it available in English dubbed;( I love the way the Japanese come up with such awesome characters when it comes to anime they are the best hands down. And what i don't understand is why do they always have to cost so much! Wish they could make it more easy for those who love anime to be able to purchase it here in the states with out it costing Thousand of dollars. I know im over es saturating but really it would be nice if they could make it less expensive and could make them English dubbed& could make a site where you could purchase Japan Anime more easily. No matter i still love my anime;) Sincerly Derrick Rivers,1309392000,,826,4.301282051282051
