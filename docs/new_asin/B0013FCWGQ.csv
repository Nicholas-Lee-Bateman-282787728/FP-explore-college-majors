8250611,5,B0013FCWGQ,"I learned a lot from this video, including how to tune my paltry with an electronic tuner. Each section is subtitled, so you can return to exactly what you need easily. The musicians play tunes at slow speeds for beginners. After you practice with their included booklet, you can play duets with them at home. It was well worth the price. You get to advance at your own speed!",1362441600,3,376,4.463768115942029
8250612,5,B0013FCWGQ,"Not much else to say but YEAH!
