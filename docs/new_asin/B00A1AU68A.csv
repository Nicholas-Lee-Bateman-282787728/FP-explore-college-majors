8546027,5,B00A1AU68A,"Taylor takes a secret mission from the president, and only those two know about the plan, but someone is leaking information from the government. It is Taylor who has to find out, but once he starts he meets Stanwyck. The group of thieves are caught and are sentenced to hang. The only problem is McKinley is shot and dies before he can help Taylor. So the question is does Stanwyck get help for Taylor or not.",1409961600,,410,4.407894736842105
8546028,5,B00A1AU68A,Taylor was not just ice candy in this movie but delivered his role beautifully. He was great as an undercover agent for the President.,1389312000,3,134,4.625

8546031,4,B00A1AU68A,"This movie teams Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck for the second time.  Their first film, ""His Brother's Wife"" made a lot of money and Fox wanted to cash in with ""This Is My Affair.""  Stanwyck and Taylor were romantically involved at this point and would marry a couple of years later.  The film follows a Navy Lieutenant who served heroically under Admiral Dewey at Manila.  At a White House soiree he is tapped by President McKinley to catch a gang of bank robbers who are destabilizing the economy. He does this by going underground as a thief who joins the gang. The costumes,sets and 1900 era dialogue are convincing.  Stanwyck can't sing so she probably shouldn't have tried. However, she looks great and is believable as the tough gang moll who falls for the ""criminal"" Taylor.  Taylor, of course, can't help looking wonderful although he is not photographed as well as he was at MGM. The romantic scenes are especially convincing. The plot is full of less than believable twists and turns but who cares.  It's a lot of fun and even manages a suspenseful ending. Brian Donlevy, Victor McLaglen, John Carradine and Sidney Blackmer support the stars effectively. The opening sequence at Arlington National Cemetery is confusing.  How did Taylor's character end up buried there in 1937?  We'll never know.  This movie has been unavailable for a long time so it's good that Fox has made it available on DVD.",1361664000,8,1412,4.821576763485477
8546032,3,B00A1AU68A,"""This is My Affair"" is a big budget ""A Class"" 20th Century Fox melodrama that highlights how star power and a high quality production cannot mask or make up for a hackneyed screenplay. Apparently,Fox Production Chief Darryl Zanuck didn't think that a first rate scenario for this film was necessary because in 1937 Robert Taylor {on loan to Fox from MGM} was in the first flush of his stardom and so hot at the box office {#3 in the 1937 box office polls} that the public would go to see him in anything he starred in.

The movies title is a ""teaser"" as Taylor and Stanwcyck were a ""mega-star couple"" rumored to be considering marriage and were very high profile and publicized all over the movie magazines. The storyline set in circa 1900 with Taylor {Lt Richard Perry} volunteering to go undercover to infiltrate a gang of bank robbers via a special commission from President W. McKinley {Frank Conroy} with only the president knowing  of this secret assignment and his identity change. Barbara Stanwyck {Lil Duryea} plays a cafe singer who is a moll and member of the gang whom Taylor is attracted to while trying to get recruited into it and {of course} they fall in love.

Victor McLaglen {Jock Ramsay} gives the film's best performance as the chief confederate of the ring's boss Brian Donlevy {Batiste Duryea} seconded by veteran character actor John Carradine. Improbable, contrived plot twists and dialogue hamper the story line with how Taylor succeeded to get into the crook's confidence being particularly ""farfetched"".

By very convenient plot developments, Taylor gets word to the authorities in time and the robbers are foiled, arrested and sentenced with President McKinley's asassination nearly doing Taylor in before Stanwyck {improbaly] manages to get him a reprieve from execution ""in the nick of time"" from new president Teddy Roosevelt {Sidney Blackmur in a nice performance} and Mr. Blackmur is Teddy's ""spitting image"" - remarkable!

Robert Taylor aged 26 and Barbara Stanwyck aged 30 were at their physical peaks and they make a stunning couple - the romantic sparks realistically fly between them especially in their final clinch. However, both of their performances are only adequate at best - in part {I think} due to the mediocre script !! Their attraction to each other is very obvious and in 1939 they would marry - after a notorious Photoplay magazine article identified them {among other couples} as charter members of ""Hollywood's Unmarried Husbands and Wives"".

William Seiter - a Fox ""house director"" of light comedy does not seem comfortable directing the film and much of it is awkwardly paced. This is not a classic film by any measurement of it's merits but taking it for what it is - a lively, entertaining if improbable period melodrama with attractive performers and nice production values - I give it a 3 1/2 star rating.",1359244800,7,2865,4.958333333333333
