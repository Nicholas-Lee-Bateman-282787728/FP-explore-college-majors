3913876,5,B002DY9KQ6,"The History Channel has done it once again! It has produced another stellar documentary. This is top-notch entertainment. ""Art of War"" examines three major American war conflicts: Vietnam, WWII, and the Civil War. How they are won or lost? That's the question these scholars and the principles of THE ART OF WAR will answer. It's  all very fascinating! The battle scenes are exciting; the visuals stunning.  The narrative is gripping. Awesome music! Despite historical debates regarding Sun Tzu and THE ART OF WAR, there's no denying their significance and influence for wartime success--even in every day life. For readings of THE ART OF WAR try the following translations:

3913886,5,B002DY9KQ6,"Sun Tzu wrote about his philosophies and principles about conquering an enemy, especially an enemy with more power than you. It has been translated and theorized by a few authors into other languages. Sun Tzu is Chinese and I have seen books entitled ""The Japanese Art of War"", but this movie and any research you do on your own will reveal, the Japanese learned from Sun Tzu. The DVD also applies how Sun Tzu's principles of conquering a larger enemy was used by other Generals throughout history, including some American Generals and military consultants. I loved all the examples and explanations and history of how these principles worked visually. Very educational and very applicable to anyone's life.

3913905,4,B002DY9KQ6,"Sun Tzu's principles are presented in a variety of expositions from ancient to modern conflicts, which aptly illustrate lessons from his treatise.  As a World War 2 student, the applications of his principles were apt. Like Machiavelli's advice to his Prince, Sun Tzu's advice to his sovereign, succeeds because the lessons are encapsulated in pithy, easily digested short lessons, each standing on its own.  Some of the battle sequences are a bit repetitious, particularly the CGI but this is a minor flaw.",1365120000,,507,5.170731707317073

I was disappointed that there were not any sequals covering the Korean War, The Burma Road and The Battle of The Bulge along with many other wars and battles.

3913910,3,B002DY9KQ6,"About all I really knew of the Vietnam War was that it was based on a US strategy of attrition, and that we eventually lost.  This show was a great help for me in understanding the details on how the US got clobbered despite our great material superiority.  I could quibble a little about a few of the interpretations which were offered by the speakers, but this segment helped me make sense of all the bits and pieces which I hadn't previously understood.  Grade = A-.

The segment on Normandy was painful to watch, for I DO know something about that battlefield.  I found some of it to be pure nonsense, and the rest to be a babytalk version of what actually happened there.  Except for this part of the DVD I'd have awarded the Art of War 5 stars.  Grade = F.

The last segment was about Lee's massive screwup at Gettysburg.  I'm certainly no expert regarding this battle, but I saw nothing which contradicted what I already knew of the engagement, and it certainly hammered home the magnitude of the errors made by the Confederate commander.  Grade = A.

To summarize, watch parts 1 & 3 while skipping the Normandy mishmash entirely, and I predict you'll this one to be a winner.",1353110400,,1183,4.481308411214953

3913912,2,B002DY9KQ6,"I saw this on Television recently, and I thought it would be definitely interesting to learn more about Sun Tzu. Instead the majority of the time, it uses specific principles of Sun's in future American-partcipated Wars. Which sounds fine, especially for newcomers of Sun Tzu's here in America. The execution wasn't good, at all.

What troubled me first was the issue that the narrator kept on saying Sun Tzu predicted these outcomes, and to make it so narrow-minded is an issue. Also, during the Vietnam War segment, he said during the segment that the soldiers did not want to be there, and the NVA knowing this, took advantage (and of the people's support). Who is he to say that every soldier was there against their free will? I sure that there was some, but all of them? I'm neither right or left, but that might be somewhat left-leaning with statements like that.

The biggest problem I had concerning the Wars is the Civil War segments. The order that Lee gave at Gettysburg that they applied a Sun principle concerning 'ambiguity' contradicted a previous statement used to find Hitler at fault with his strategies at D-Day (which was the best segment of the show to me) about trusting your commanders. Lee said for him to act when he feel that he needs to. I'm under the impression that Lee trusted his general to make the right decision, and didn't get involved with his decision making. Also, the segment with the amputation was unneccesary. The 'doctor' was giving a menacing grin while sawing off his leg, then after he's done he walks off like nothing happened. Unrealistic.

The style of the reanactments also cheapens the film, and undermines the viewers' ability to imagine the situations. There was too many types of presentations of the show, it seems as if the producers couldn't figure out how it wanted to present it. However, the highlight was the Normandy segment. they did mentions facts that people generally don't know (that Hitler stationed the majority of his men elsewhere, for example) and was somewhat insightful.
With that being said, that segment made me feel that this show had potential, but the lack of any objectivity and contradictions with the others made me feel as if it might not have been possible to apply his principles without appearing short-sighted (after all, Hitlers micromanagement of his commanders almost worked out for him). It makes it appear that all of Sun Tzu's principles would have made all of these outcomes preventable, and I don't think it's that simple.",1323820800,4,2518,4.864801864801865
3913913,2,B002DY9KQ6,"The vast majority of this documentary doesn't involve Sun Tzu, but actually to applying Sun Tzu's principles to the Vietnam War, World War II, and the American Civil War.

There's almost nothing about Sun Tzu's work, beyond selecting a handful of the most basic principles and applying them to future wars.

But the information used is blindingly narrow, and in some cases, offensive.

In the American Civil War segment, Sun Tzu quotes are used liberally to basically make Lee at Gettysburg out to be some kind of idiotic moron.  Completely ignored are all the factors that caused the battle to unfold the way it did:

- They criticize Lee for not sending a cavalry reconnaissance before the battle to scout the Union force skirmishing them at Gettysburg.

HE DIDN'T HAVE CAVALRY TO DO SO!  General Stuart had the vast majority of Lee's cavalry, and was off behind Union lines, leaving Lee's army blind if not for an actor hired by Longstreet to act as spy.

- They criticize Lee's order to Ewell to attack Cemetery Hill ""if practicable"".

Vague and stupid as this order was, by many accounts, Cemetery Hill was poorly defended, and General Trimble was VEHEMENT in trying to push Ewell to take the hill.  They also criticize Lee's order for being ""vague"" and unclear.  There's nothing particularly vague to an order saying ""Take this hill, if you can"".

- They criticize Lee for engaging the enemy on the high ground, and wax smug in berating the entire battle's decision, praising Longstreet, even going so far as to think that General Longstreet had Sun Tzu in mind with his decision to disengage and march on Washington D.C.

COMPLETELY IGNORED in this case, not just left out, but ACTIVELY IGNORED, is the fact that Lee's army is on borrowed time.  If they do not fight at Gettysburg, they will not fight on Union soil, ever again.  They are running low on all supplies, they have no more reinforcements coming.  If they disengage the Union army at Gettysburg, they will be forced to leave.

A counter-march on Washington D.C. would not only waste precious time and resources, but it would basically GUARANTEE the COMPLETE AND TOTAL DESTRUCTION of the Army of Northern Virginia; Washington D.C. was heavily fortified.  Attacking it would've been as deadly as attacking the army at Gettysburg, and given that the whole intent of this plan was to force the Union Army to disengage and march towards Washington, this basically leaves the Army of Northern Virginia TRAPPED BETWEEN TWO ARMIES.

I would not trust anyone in this documentary with actual military strategy",1323388800,5,2568,4.862068965517241
3913914,5,B002DY9KQ6,"This is a very informative, well written, well made, and exciting documentary that explains what Sun Tsu's Art of War is in a condensed one and a half hours. It provides real world examples depicted in vivid imagery and reenactments from the Vietnam War to D-Day. I've read the Art of War and books explaining the Art of War and this documentary rates among my favorite experiences in learning about the Art of War.

Highly recommended to someone who wants a crash course on Sun Tsu's teachings.",1315612800,,495,4.689655172413793
3913915,5,B002DY9KQ6,"The teachings from Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"" is something I only recently discovered while visiting my local library. Although I've heard of his book before, I never got into it til recently, which is truly my bad. The DVD itself takes his important lessons and provides expert analysis with the lessons Sun Tzu felt were important in winning battles, which would subsequently be used by personnel in the armed forces and the financial sector in overcoming odds and subsequently becoming victorious. About a 90 minute long documentary from the History Channel, people who have not read the book will still be able to grasp the teachings from Sun Tzu that are still applied in real life today.

Although it's been several months since reading the book and watching the dvd, there are quotes that will have a lasting impression on me such as ""Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can?"" and ""Do not thwart an enemy retreating home. If you surround the enemy, leave an outlet; do not press an enemy that is cornered. These are the principles of warfare"". Although a reviewer mentioned the 2 Geisha girls getting decapitated from the beginning, Sun Tzu's tenet in avoiding battle as much as possible while achieving victory is truly a remarkable notion, in addition to his other tenets that promote knowledge of yourself and your enemy, courage, confidence, and wisdom.",1309478400,,1376,4.805907172995781
3913916,5,B002DY9KQ6,"You have to love a DVD from the history channel that begins with the decapitation of two geisha girls. The Art of War focuses on the military applications of this 400 BC warrior, and it would also be nice to see a DVD from the history channel on the Sports, Politics, and Business applications for these principles as well. For now, this is a DVD that requires repeated viewings and contemplation that you will learn somthing new from with each viewing. Whatever issues you may be facing in your own life, there is an applicable principle from Sun Tzuthat will guide you to better decision making. The true value of this product is that Sun Tzu's principles can be reviewed in a convenient, entertaining, visual format.",1297382400,,719,4.714285714285714

However having said that I must say in modern day warfare when you can drop a bomb from a unmanned plane it's hard to realize that Sun Tuz's tactics are still studied at military collages today.",1295827200,,365,3.88
3913918,5,B002DY9KQ6,"Watching the DVD for at least the fifth time now, and still riveted.  Seen it a few times before on the History Channel and knew I had to have my own copy.  I've read the Art of War before quite a few times, so the main points of this presentation were all nothing I didn't already know.  Where this presentation shines is how it uses the war between the ancient Chinese kingdoms of Wu and Chu as the main backdrop and reinforces it with the examples of the Vietnam War, D-Day, and the Battle of Gettysburg by illustrating their successes and failures where Sun Tzu's principles apply.  Follow them and prevail, ignore them and fail.  This presentation not only makes that clear, but its strongest point is to break it all down to the level of understanding of both a brand new Private in Basic Training and a Freshman year Cadet.  My only disagreement is very minor, it comes from the Vietnam War segment and the D-Day segment.  One of Sun Tzu's principles is that it is essential to victory that Generals must be unconstrained by the Sovereign, does apply to Gen Westmoreland as much as it did to Gen Eisenhauer.  While it is true that Gen. Westmoreland's Chess Strategy failed against Gen. Giap's Go Strategy, anyone who has the most simple understanding of that war from a correct viewpoint instead of a politically correct one knows that President Johnson and SECDEF McNamera micro-managed Gen Westmoreland wheras Gen Giap did not have the same problems from Ho Chi Minh.  No mention of that fact does an injustice to Gen Westmoreland and his men.  Given Gen. Westmoreland's military background of Airborne since WWII, it is very likely that if he wasn't micro-managed by LBJ and McNamera, he would have done a Go strategy as expected from an Airborne officer.  However, I do understand the reasoning of the makers of this program in illustrating the failure of the Chess Strategy in the Vietnam segment when the point of the folly of political interference was better presented and easier to understand in the D-Day segment.  A mere mention of that folly in the Vietnam segment when comparing the advantages and disadvantages held by Giap and Westmoreland would have sufficed.  Going into detail of that fact would have made the D-Day segment nothing but beating a dead horse.  That is my only criticism of this program.

Overall, however, the title of my review is only half of the bottom line.  It is an excellent prep for beginners whether they be cadets in their freshman year or privates in basic training because of it's simplicity and brevity.  The other half is that the very same simplicity makes it an equally excellent reinforcement for both the Officer and NCO corps who have already been taught and studied the Art of War prior.  Therefore, I not only recommend without reservation to subordinates, peers, and superiors alike, I have ordered another copy to make gift to my nephew who had graduated US Army Basic Training from my own alma mata, Fort Knox.",1283644800,,2974,4.752918287937743

As a student of military history and a former grunt, I can say this video puts it all together, excellent visuals, clear story telling and narration.
Sun Tzu's manual comes to life here.
Of course there is violence, death, this is The Art Of War, however, nothing most of you haven't seen on the nightly news.
I do take issue with those who say the USA lost the war( the narrator states this) in Vietnam.. NOT so. We were never defeated on the battlefield. We were defeated politically at home.. we lost the will to stay the course. This Video relates to the battlefield. This video does an excellent job in it's full presentation.. A Must Buy",1269216000,7,751,4.57037037037037
3913921,5,B002DY9KQ6,"The DVD explains Sun Tzu's Art of War and uses it to examine D-Day, Gettysburg and the Tet Offensive.  In fact the DVD touches on each of the wars, seeming to focus a large amount of time on the Vietnam conflict.  They use Sun Tzu's ideas on how war should be run as a template to compare the different sides, the factors, and the commanders.  It was interesting and frankly, I found the discussion about the Tet Offensive the most interesting.  Let's face facts, World War II and the American Civil War has been analyzed, examined, explored and explained to death.  But while I have books on Vietnam I rarely find ones that truly helps me understand WHY we lost.  This DVD really DID explain to me how both sides fought the war and, according to the rules made by Sun Tzu, why the US lost and the Northern Vietnamese won.
Now, the special effects were sometimes OK, but I have to say they were not great.  In the Battle of Gettysburg they show some soldiers aiming their muskets into the sky!  And it could get pretty bloody, violent, and racy.  They showed a bloody hospital scene in the part about the Civil War and a realistic knife fight between an American GI and a German soldier.  There was also a scene, shown twice I believe, of hookers acting as spies for North Vietnam.  Very shapely, sexy girls in tiny dresses.  My older nephew had to leave the room when they were about to saw off a Civil War soldier's leg.  He didn't ask about the hookers but if you have younger kids I suggest not letting them watch it till you have.  It is in Color, 94 minutes long, and while very good does not cover the Art of War completely.  So I would suggest getting a book copy - but be warned some are better than others.  I would shop around!",1267315200,4,1738,4.3343653250774

3913923,4,B002DY9KQ6,"- Computer Graphic and Human Actors make this DVD interesting.

- It excitingly and skillfully illustrates how some battles or wars were won based on Sun Tzu's principles. These battles took places during the American civil war, World War II and Vietnam war.

- The over-doing of the conversation makes me wonder how accurate this document is compared to history books. For example, the back cover of this DVD reads ""Sun Tzu was the Nostradamus of warfare..."" In the film, the narrator says ""Sun Tzu predicted the outcome of the Vietnam War and the Allies' landing in Normandy..."" No, Sun Tzu could not do that. He died thousand of years before these historical events.

  - In short, the DVD is informative and entertaining. It's the only one of this kind. I own it.",1257897600,10,767,4.7368421052631575

However, the narrator objectivity is questionable, and thus, the presentation's merit.  For instance, in several occasions he claims ""Sun Tzu predicted the outcome of the Vietnam War and the Ally Landing in Normandy"" No evidence of such prediction is shown (Of course; from 600BC) So, how much of this is fluff?",1256169600,13,568,4.968421052631579

8366337,5,B002DY9KQ6,"The Art of War DVD is both entertaining and informative. It elaborates on Sun Tzu's most influential teachings taken from the Art of War to analyze and predict the outcomes of key U.S. battles from the American Civil War, WW II, and Vietnam. It also covers the history and background of Sun Tzu himself. Highly recommended for anyone interested in military history, strategy and tactics!",1500076800,,387,4.969230769230769

8366340,5,B002DY9KQ6,"I haven't read the book, but understand that it describes the strategy and tactics of war, which have been adopted and proven successful since it was written in 550 B.C.  This documentary illustrates, mostly through historical film, those principles as applied in the Vietnam War, World War II and the Civil War.  I am female and wish wars did not have to be fought, but I thought this was fascinating. It demonstrates the immutability of war and George Santayana's saying ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.""  I recommend it whole-heartedly.",1485561600,,570,4.978947368421053

8366342,5,B002DY9KQ6,"I used it to augment my lecture on the subject for a summer session. Made the lectures pertainant for today's students. I wish history did more these programs like they used to back in the 90s. I remember in the early 90s, Mike Rowe stand in a dark room with a blazer and khakis giving a lecture. Sadly today, it's Pickers.",1470614400,2,323,4.311475409836065
8366343,5,B002DY9KQ6,My suggestion is to read The Art of War first and then watch this film.  The film does a great job illustrating Sun Tzu's major points about winning in warfare. The images are gory at times. The carnage shown is a little disturbing.  To me this reinforces Sun Tzu's contention that the best victory you can achieve is to win without fighting.,1470096000,6,342,4.5
