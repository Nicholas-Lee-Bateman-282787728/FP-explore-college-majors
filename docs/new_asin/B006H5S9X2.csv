8498224,5,B006H5S9X2,"I had been waiting on this DVD and was not disappointed at all when it was produced and shipped.  The video is very detailed as to how to use a Canon 60D.  Cooksey goes through all of the different dials and buttons in detail showing you what you can do and not do with the camera.  There are also many actual examples in the various shooting modes.  No matter if you are a beginner or a professional photographer, there is something in this video for you.  I highly recommend it.",1361232000,,480,4.288888888888889
8498225,2,B006H5S9X2,"The presenters surely didn't watch this video after the made it.

Too much talk, and not enough action.

John Cooksey has a bad habit of moving his fingers over different buttons whilst talking, meaning that you don't know what button he is pressing.

My grandchildren could have given a better presentation.",1356220800,,308,5.0
