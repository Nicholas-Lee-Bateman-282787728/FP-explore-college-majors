4465838,4,B004TJWDNA,Dragon lord not that impressive. Operation Condor  and OC 2 are entertaining. Twin Dragons is full of laughs and action. Jackie Chan Fun Kung-fu.,1417478400,,145,5.041666666666667
4465839,5,B004TJWDNA,"Great combo set for Jackie Chan fans, I personally bought this set simply for the first movie, Operation Condor but enjoyed watching them all. Operation Condor 2 was an also see but the others were not movies I would recommend spending hard earned dollars on... overall its a win-win deal since for the price of just one dvd you get all four!",1363046400,,342,4.532258064516129

4465841,1,B004TJWDNA,"It's actually a zero star. After I bought this, I researched and found that most Miramax movies like this one don't provide English subtitles. It's unfair to Deaf people like me. I have to pay more for movies one by one that provides the subtitles. *rme*",1339891200,12,254,4.543478260869565
4465842,4,B004TJWDNA,"This was a real steal.  Four feature length moves for one low price.  Of course, I already have two of the movies but they are on VHS where as this is a DVD so it is a lot easier to use.  As always Jackie Chan is excellent in all of them.  In Twin Dragons, I really dislike Boomers friend Tyson, but the rest of the movie moves along fine.",1317600000,7,339,3.869565217391304

8440731,3,B004TJWDNA,"Yep, that's them. Only needed one but got all four.",1453680000,,51,4.2
8440732,1,B004TJWDNA,"Not exactly the ideal way of watching any of these movies. All of them are the edited for attention spans versions released through Dimension during the late 90s when Chan hit big with Rumble in the Bronx. At least three of them were attempts by Miramax/Dimension to lamely modernize a flick from the late 80s or early 90s. Confusing re-titles to the Armour of God series makes the first movie a sequel to it's own sequel. All are dubbed rather Ok-if not spectacular, Chan at least dubs himself in three of them. Dragon Lord has the worst dub. Even a poor imitator of Chan dubbing his lines.
However besides Chan, the dubbing in the others is rather sub-par. Sometimes having the effect of making the movies into cartoons, in fact some of the dub voices are similar ones to anime. Twin Dragons did have some great dubbing from Bai Ling, but that was about it.",1452556800,,859,4.548387096774194
