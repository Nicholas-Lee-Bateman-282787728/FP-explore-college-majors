2298710,5,B0009K7R1Q,I have a three-year-old who loves this video we borrowed from the local library. He already knows the layers of a rain forest and can name a few animals in each layer. I have a degree in elementary education and truly realize how important positive exposure to new things are to children. He also gets angry at the part where they show the cutting down of trees and tells the man to pick them back up! Hello! Do you need more of a hint? Videos like this are truly benificial to children.,1050192000,8,487,4.304347826086956
2298721,5,B0009K7R1Q,"I bought this for my son who loves all animals and this is not done like normal NG programs with images and commentary.  It's done fast paced like Sesame Street with lots of color and music and images.  You still learn, but I felt this one was more for kids than adults. My son liked it, he is 8, but he prefers LIFE over this.",1391040000,,327,4.015384615384615
2298722,5,B0009K7R1Q,"Our 5 year old is obsessed with all creatures, great and small. This movie (and others in the series) is educational, age appropriate, and moves at a nice pace.",1388448000,,160,4.551724137931035
2298723,5,B0009K7R1Q,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old grand-daughter. Word back from Mom is that it is a big hit! Lots of new facts and awesome photography... she was specifically interested in spider monkeys, and there was a little about them -- and so many more things to become interested in!",1387756800,,293,4.345454545454546
2298724,5,B0009K7R1Q,Beautiful video and well documented. Easy to use in the classroom for students so they know more about the problems affecting the rainforest.,1385683200,,141,5.173913043478261
2298725,5,B0009K7R1Q,"My second grade truly enjoyed the action and adventure. You'll meet the cutest characters and some cool ones too.
So, what are you waiting for? Go Buy ""Really Wild Animals:Totally Tropical Rain Forest"" today!

2298726,4,B0009K7R1Q,THIS WAS A GOOD DVD BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS GEARED MORE FOR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN AND SO I GAVE IT AWAY TO THE CHILDREN. I WANTED ONE OF THE AMAZON AND THE RAIN FOREST BUT I THINK THERE IS OTHERS THAT I WOULD BE MORE HAPPY WITH.,1366675200,,224,3.6875
2298727,4,B0009K7R1Q,"This isn't the kids' favorite video, but it is very informative, and they will watch it multiple times (as long as you throw it into the rotation with other videos).

It has some great cinematography.

The sounds can be a little irritating to us adults, but it isn't the most annoying video by a long shot.",1362614400,,306,4.446428571428571
2298728,3,B0009K7R1Q,This one was OK but not as good as the African one.  Grandchildren aren't as interested but do watch it.,1362528000,,104,4.2
2298729,5,B0009K7R1Q,My 7 year old grandson and is friends loved it! National Geographic is great! Will definitely look for more movies like this one.,1356998400,,129,4.6521739130434785
2298730,5,B0009K7R1Q,"I am very pleased with this great DVD especially since it has great stories for children, and teachers, like me, can use it in the classroom.  It was a great buy!",1356048000,,162,4.225806451612903
2298740,3,B0009K7R1Q,Colorful and interesting. Not a great scientific video but not shabby either. Makes some good points about the need to sustain the forest. My grandson watched it three times in one weekend.,1351209600,2,189,4.9375
2298741,2,B0009K7R1Q,"This movie was not my cup of tea!  Don't think I have
ever seen one as bad as this one!  Yuk!",1335916800,,93,3.380952380952381
2298742,3,B0009K7R1Q,"This DVD was slightly disappointing.

While is beautiful and beautifully done it lacks any real educational value. It doesn't go into any depth about anything, it's a very broad overview and gives you just a couple of tidbits for each animal. It also has songs along the way. It's good for preschoolers or maybe little bit older kids that don't care much for science, but probably not for upper elementary kids.

When I asked my homeschooled 7 year old what he learned from it, he said ""not much"", because he knew most of it already. He was able to tell me what all it covered but also able to tell me where he had already learned it plus elaborate in more detail about the animals.

 My 4 year old liked it though, which is rare, he's not as much of a TV watcher as my 7 year old and he normally only watches cartoon/puppet based shows. But this had enough entertainment to it to keep his interest. It was cute and entertaining and a good introduction to rain forest and its inhabitants.",1300060800,6,988,4.412087912087912
2298743,5,B0009K7R1Q,I watched this dvd with my grandchildren and we all enjoyed it very much.  The video is great and Dudley Moore's comments very entertaining.,1276300800,5,140,4.833333333333333
2298744,4,B0009K7R1Q,"This is a really fun video that I recommend for children.  I bought it for my 6 year old granddaughter, and we enjoyed watching it together.  It's very informative about the inhabitants of the rain forest in a fun format, and I appreciated that there were no gorey scenes when talking about who eats whom for lunch!",1275350400,,315,4.508771929824562
2298745,5,B0009K7R1Q,"Cute movie with lots of good information presented in a format that keeps kids interested.  Recommend for 7th grade and under, however the adults enjoyed it also.",1272758400,,162,5.0
2298746,5,B0009K7R1Q,"What a great dvd! We got this for our son on his 5th birthday in anticipation of a trip to Costa Rica. He couldn't get enough of it! He thought Spin, the cartoon globe narrator (Dudley Moore) was hilarious and he was transfixed by the stunning photography. We adults learned a lot too, and it set us all up for getting the most out of our trip. Our tour guides were quite impressed when this little five year old was spitting out facts about every animal we saw.",1265414400,,462,4.261363636363637
2298747,3,B0009K7R1Q,Bought this for my 7 yr old cousin. Thought this would be something he would enjoy. He did.,1231632000,3,91,4.111111111111111
2298748,5,B0009K7R1Q,"I bought this for my grandson,who is 7 and he loved it. The 3 year old loves it as well. It is very educational and fun for the whole family. It is interactive with questions asked throughout with games. The photography is stunning. I plan on getting others in this series right away. The adults enjoy it as well",1207353600,15,312,4.305084745762712
2298749,5,B0009K7R1Q,"I ordered this DVD for my 7 year old son.  Also because I am the Bible School Director for my church and we are doing a ""Rainforest Adventure"" theme.  This DVD is so well done . . . we have watched it several times.  The colors, music and scenes are amazing . .  we literally stop in our tracks and watch it.  I can't wait to show it to the kids at VBS.  Well done.  My son especially likes the question and answer part of the DVD.  Great music, great info.  All around a good DVD for the price.",1201392000,19,495,3.919191919191919

8062690,5,B0009K7R1Q,"I ordered this DVD for a homeschool unit on the rainforests, and it was perfect. My girls were 4 and 6 at the time, and they loved the book, and the entire unit. At the end of the unit, we hosted a Rainforest Party to raise money for The Nature Conservancy, and our family was featured in TNC's magazine!",1503619200,,304,4.169491525423729
8062691,2,B0009K7R1Q,"The video shows some interesting animals, but the information is waaayyy too basic for even my elementary classes. I ended up showing my classes clips from Nat Geo Wild instead. On the positive, it arrived in good condition.",1471132800,,224,4.921052631578948
