8406391,4,B003V5CTBO,"this is good. I remember seeing this on the tv when I was a young fella. I think the strength of memory of the martyrs and hymn are what gave me an interest in these guys. I don't dislike them, they are just a little m.o.r.
it's not that they are bad, they are just a little boring. I have gotten used to great musicians and vocalists, and these guys are good, just not great.
if you like more gentle 70's music, you'll probably like this. the audio and video are pretty good.",1481241600,,476,4.129032258064516
8406392,5,B003V5CTBO,very satisfied,1437177600,,14,6.5
8406393,5,B003V5CTBO,What is here is very good! It isn't quite half the entire show. But I knew this when I bought it. The missing footage wasn't good enough for releasing on a video.,1434326400,,162,4.09375
8406394,3,B003V5CTBO,"The keyboard players they had on this concert used the most rinky dink sounds for their synthesizer parts.  And the group sounded a little nervous, with many of the tempos being a little faster than on the records.  It is okay, but not anywhere near as good as the Glasnost concert DVD.",1430524800,,286,4.480769230769231
8406395,5,B003V5CTBO,"Time honored classic! If you love BJH then don't hesitate to buy this DVD.
Over 250,000 people showed up = amazing!",1404086400,,115,4.523809523809524
8406396,5,B003V5CTBO,"The film quality and camera angles are very good. Even in 4:3 aspect ratio (typical for 1980 TV), the concert looked great. The sound quality was fantastic! I watched it in DTS surround, and it blew me away. The DVD turned out to be much better than I expected. Even though much of the concert had been cut up for TV, what was left for the DVD were some of the bands best songs. I highly recommend this for any BJH fan.",1394496000,,419,4.121951219512195
8406397,5,B003V5CTBO,"tHIS IS A VERY GOOD DVD WITH GREAT SOUND AND PICTURE. NICE TO SEE THESE GUYS STILL PERFORMING.
WELL DONE",1363305600,,104,4.25
8406398,5,B003V5CTBO,"I had bought this concert dvd for my brother.  I was not familiar with Barclay James Harvest so had no idea what the music would be like, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I like that it is a true concert video, not interrupting the songs as in other dvds that profess to be ""concert videos"" but spend more time on behind the scenes.  If you like a concert that is not ""heavy metal"" or ""soft rock"", this group delivers.",1346544000,,418,4.265822784810126
8406399,4,B003V5CTBO,Thank goodness footage for this concert was found. The band is at it's peak but what makes this DVD a keeper is the 5 bonus tracks from 1975 that are pre-MTV low budget promo's. A real great find.,1294617600,,196,4.184210526315789
