4711632,4,B005J7K9BO,"This documentary isn't as deep as it could be, but it is very illuminating and entertaining. It is a fantastic blend of commentary, film clips, humor, and history.  I showed this documentary to a room of teenagers and adults. They were all focused and absorbed by it (which, if you work with youth, you know is quite an accomplishment!). The film provoked several good conversations.

I highly recommend this film, especially to start some discussion.",1337385600,8,451,5.0
4711633,1,B005J7K9BO,"I got this with the intention of seeing the evolution of Native Americans in film.  Instead, I received a political ""poor us"" statement with very little cinema clips.  I only got 30 minutes through it before I turned it off.  Maybe the documentary showed more movie depictions and analysis later on, but I wasn't seeing much of it up to that point.

Don't get me wrong.  I know the Indian has been badly mistreated over the years, but I was not looking for a political film.  I love movies and just wanted to see the evolution of Native Peoples over the years depicted by Hollywood. I got a much different DVD than I wanted or was expecting. As long as you know what you're getting into and are happy with that, then you should enjoy this.  Otherwise, find some other resource for Indians in film.",1333929600,4,797,4.455172413793103
4711634,5,B005J7K9BO,"If you like documentaries about the representations of people of color in film (e.g., ""Fade to Black,"" ""The Slanted Screen,"" or ""The Bronze Screen""), then you will like this.

This documentary shows mostly Native American film critics analyzing depictions of Native Americans in film.  This moves from nickelodeon images to ""The Fast Runner.""  Those interested in cultural studies will especially like this as it practices constructionism.  The work emphasizes that changing times create changing images.  For example, as the counter-culturalists of the 1960s and 1970s embraced Native American cultures and activism, then Natives in film became ""groovy.""

I learned a lot here.  It turns out that wearing headbands is more a Hollywood invention than a true Indian cultural practice.  (Then again, Scandinavians didn't wear hats with horns, that was an operatic invention.)  Most importantly, this work exposed me to the life and death of Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance.  He seemed like a Black counterpart to Grey Owl and I'm going to dedicate myself to learning more about him.

I did have some concerns, however.  There is a lot of focus on watching the Native director go through a journey.  While I understand that it may be important to illustrate that this was a Native-made documentary, I think they could have said more about the films themselves if there had been an unseen narrator.  The work concludes by saying ""The Fast Runner"" may be the pinnacle and future of Natives in film.  However, that film was about Alaska Natives, a group that never gets mentioned before that point.  (For more on them, please see the book ""Freeze Frame."")  Thus, the work blurs ""Native American"" and ""indigenous"" by the end.  Wearing a pro-feminist hat, this work does focus on male characters and male interviews, even though both genders are covered.  In fairness, there may be more male depictions than female ones in actual movies.  However, female viewers may feel a tiny bit left out.

There are several films that get ignored here and thus the work may be more of a cursory exploration.  Little was said on ""Dances with Wolves.""  I recall nothing on ""Black Robe"" or ""The Business of Fancy Dancing,"" etc.",1329177600,9,2203,5.024861878453039
4711635,5,B005J7K9BO,"Being part Native American, I get tired of the images Hollywood have created. I teach Native American history and the great diversity among the tribes. I have to first unteach what Hollywood portrayed.  This DVD is honest and informative.  I wished this could be shown in all the schools.",1329091200,26,288,4.857142857142857
4711636,5,B005J7K9BO,"I just finished watching this bio on the history of the Native American in movies, and have to say that my eyes were opened up to a lot of stereotypes that I'd held myself regarding they way they've been portrayed in the history of filmdom.  From the beginning with silent films to the savage and inaccurate portrayals depicted in westerns up until about the 60s, then to the more adept features in the last 25 years, this is a truly well-done feature for anybody interested in the truth.  Featuring activist Russell Means and actors Graham Greene, Adam Beach, and Wes Studi, it is an interesting and fascinating account of a group of people who are really more like us than Hollywood would have you believe.  I am just a bit curious about Beach's comments since he was in questionable films like Squanto and Now and Forever, but then again, he was in great movies like Dance Me Outside and Windtalkers.  I agree with the assessment of the films throughout the 30s to the early 60s, but how they missed the obviously worst portrayal of ""injuns"" I've ever seen in the Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe vehicle River of No Return is astounding.  They were a stereotypical mixture of the worst sort I've ever seen!

Immensely enjoyable is the story of the classic ""crying Indian"" from the old Saturday morning programming of my childhood who was actually Italian, but adopted the native ways through and through.  I also appreciated the fact that Little Big Man was acknowledged as a groundbreaking film that was more truthful to the Cheyenne.  If you want the lowdown on which era of movies to watch that portray them in the best light and the worst, check this bio out.  Your eyes will be opened wide, and you will come to appreciate the contributions they have made to our society.  Not to be missed!",1327363200,4,1800,4.649842271293376

There is commentary by today's Indians who are actors, producers and filmmakers.  Nicely done, and yes with humor included.  A story that was waiting to be told.",1298073600,26,489,4.926829268292683

4711641,4,B005J7K9BO,"Very good documentary!  I showed this documentary as part of my unit covering The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie.  My students really enjoyed all the movie clips and were surprised at some of the old racist clips that would never be okay today.  My one complaint-this documentary contains nudity at the very end.  It's not exactly brief, either.  I didn't think it was really necessary to show a naked, running Native American over and over again.  If you are watching this for a high school class, you might end the documentary a few minutes early.",1450137600,3,580,4.75

4711667,5,B005J7K9BO,"This movie was thorough in its scope and subject matter. As a native person , I see how it just began to touch on how Hollywood was yet another form that attempted to contain the Native people. It answered so much while it also brought up many more questions for me to peruse. One in particular was one of its tragedies, Chief Buffalo CHild Long Lance. He was a product of his time and environment. Today he probably would have been seen merely as a Native man. At the time in which he lived , during the reign of the racial ""One Drop"" rule the small part of African blood that was a part of him negated any other part of him. He was of Cherokee descent , however it was unfortunate that he felt he had to spend his entire life trying to remove himself from another part of his ancestry.",1385078400,4,787,4.184210526315789

Only up till recent years have Native people been directors and have attempted to put a better light on what is really going on with the Native populations and how genocide has affected all, people and shaped their ideas of what Natives are.
