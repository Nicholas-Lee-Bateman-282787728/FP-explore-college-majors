3852840,5,B00267BXOC,Purchased this for my dads birthday after years of a junky VHS copy. He was thrilled with it! It arrived right on time for his birthday and in perfect condition.,1394323200,,161,4.4
3852841,5,B00267BXOC,We've owned this movie for a couple of years and have watched it for many family movie nights. The storyline is so positive with a great lesson that can be talked about after the film. We feel that this film is well made and the acting is great. It's hard to find family movies these days and this is one I highly recommend. I've also purchased it to give to other families as gifts. You won't be disappointed.,1372377600,,410,4.269230769230769
3852842,3,B00267BXOC,The video was dark at times and difficult to see at times but the movie itself was enjoyable. Hope this can be rectified.,1368057600,,121,4.304347826086956
3852843,4,B00267BXOC,In this world of today it is ard for a parent to find good family films that have good morals. I found it in this film! It also includes a parents guide for great family discussion.,1358121600,,181,4.055555555555555
3852844,5,B00267BXOC,"This was first released as ""The Whipping Boy"" (Same as the book it is based on).  Now released as ""Prince Brat and the Whipping Boy"", with some scenes edited down or deleted.  While the deletions do take something away from the original film, there is still enough of the story left to deliver a very good tale and adventure.  Although this version is still an excellent show, I'd very much like to see the original (unedited) offered as well.  Those issues aside, a great story, well told and acted out by all, the 'heavies' (the adult actors), and the children - all played their parts to the hilt -resulting in a very entertaining piece.",1355529600,2,640,4.587719298245614
3852845,4,B00267BXOC,Good delivery and good price. This was a movie based on a book my middle school class read.  It was a little different but this movie kept the interest of the kids the whole time.,1351555200,,179,4.114285714285714
3852846,4,B00267BXOC,"This movie version of a book my class read was a pleasant surprise. It is well-crafted and a
highly enjoyable viewing experience. It touches on the emotions of what it feels like to be ignored by a parent, as it tells the story of two young boys locked in their respective social classes who eventually find common ground and friendship. Add this to your DVD library.",1325116800,2,367,4.575757575757576
