8305455,3,B001GILTLY,"Purchased this for my son that was having problems memorizing his addition and subtraction hoping the music and cute characters would help him memorize it better.
Bored him to tears and anytime I asked him to watch it even for one segment he would fight me.  The disc also skipped so I sent it back and got a replacement...the replacement skipped too.  Not thrilled and felt like it was a waste of money.",1451433600,,404,4.52054794520548
8305456,1,B001GILTLY,I would return it if I could. We didn't finish watching it.  I really wouldn't reccomend this DVD. Especially if magic is something you try to avoid.,1445644800,,149,4.518518518518518

8305458,3,B001GILTLY,"The quality of this DVD isn't fantastic, but I can look past it (the cartoons are drawn poorly etc). It's also a bit long. My daughter loses interest in it after about 20 minutes. That being said, she IS memorizing addition tables. So it works! It goes into some tips and tricks about how to add which I think is unnecessary and a bit boring for her. Overall, because she IS learning....I like (not love) it. She likes it too, but  not as much as other videos...I should also mention that she is just about 3. The WORST thing about it (as another commenter said) was that there is a girl in the classroom who keeps interrupting. She interrupts me!  It bothers me when ""educational"" type videos or children cartoons model and repeatedly show ""bad behavior.""",1313798400,4,756,4.551470588235294
8305459,2,B001GILTLY,"My children watch educational videos regularly, including the sight words DVD offered with the same kid 2020 logo on it. Despite their high tolerance for educational DVDs, we were extremely disappointed in the Math Facts DVD. The educational part did not hold the interest of any of my children (age 3, age 4 & two age 6). Part of the problem was during the rhythmic learning part. The poor graphics didn't seem to bother the children, but the volume and tones of the voices varied way too much. Some of the math facts were too loud, while others were too soft and difficult to hear. My son was very frustrated when he couldn't hear what they were saying. The worst part of the DVD was the poor behavioral modeling. In the ""classroom"" section of the show, there is a little girl who is constantly disruptive and off task. The teacher tells her to raise her hand or stay on topic, or something like that, but the girl continues the poor behavior. My children did not get anything worthwhile out of this video. I was surprised to see a few decent reviews......  All four of my children enjoyed the Learning Treehouse Addition, Leapfrog Math Circus, Mathtacular, Meet the Sight Words, Dolch Sight Words and Rock n Learn Phonics. This is one of the rare few educational videos I do NOT recommend.",1313193600,4,1292,4.6173913043478265
8305460,4,B001GILTLY,"This movie at first seemed a little young, but then it got going and it was better. It seemed to help my daughter who is visually impaired to begin to memorize her facts.  That is what I wanted from it.  The music and rhythmic timing of the facts were really nice and helpful for her.",1313107200,,284,4.1454545454545455
8305461,3,B001GILTLY,was not what i was expecting it was ok I was hoping for better graphics and a more simple way to teach addition. It may just not have been the right level for my 4 year olds but I will probably keep it around and use it in a few years,1304294400,,234,3.607843137254902
8305462,5,B001GILTLY,"While I'm not sure it would hold the attention of a 6+ yo, this is a great video for the Toddler/PreK education video junkies out there (if your kids like the old Signing Times, Leap Frog Letter Factory, and/or Your Baby Can Read videos, they'll probably be down with this too). The production quality is not high and many of the songs feel a little forced, but my kids don't seem to mind much. Let's face it, there's just not a whole lot of Math video options for this age bracket! The Munchkin Math series, Hip Hop Homeroom, and now this video have gone a long way to peak my kids' interest in math learning - so that alone earns it a 5 star from me!",1264032000,12,652,4.182539682539683
