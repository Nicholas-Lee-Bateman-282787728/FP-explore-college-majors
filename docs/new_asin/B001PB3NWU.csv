3746109,5,B001PB3NWU,"An amazing movie on the life of an amazing priest. A must see for all! I was so enthralled by his story, the 3 hour movie felt like 20 minutes. Wonderful!!!*****",1263600000,3,161,4.225806451612903
3746110,1,B001PB3NWU,"I am a Catholic who has spent a great deal time in Italy and can assure you that this film gives a bad name to ""b"" movies. It was like a spoof on Padre Pio making him appear like a wimpy caricature of himself. The first thing you notice is that the main actor looks like the American Robert Wagner only older--and the poor viewer can't escape that thought throughout the film. For film students, this is an excellent example of poor casting, from the main characters all the way down to the minor roles. Shame on you, Ignatius Press, for hyping up this piece of bumbling amateurism and ripping off countless good-faith buyers. There were some absolutely silly moments, including a struggle with the devil which leaves the audience just hoping the fake Pio will get his katouzy kicked! Throughout the film, Padre Pio is so wimpish that the viewer soon wonders why he doesn't just stay in a fetal position the whole time. The make-up is ridiculous, even the costuming. The Franciscans have the wrong hair cuts and look like a bunch of bewildered buffoons without a spine. Another Franciscan looks like something out of one of Molire's comedies with giant, oversize black horn-rimmed eyeglasses. At one point half-way through, Padre Pio starts wearing his cintura so high--just under his armpits--that he literally looks pregnant. Imagine a Franciscan habit with an Empire waist! No Catholic, no agnostic, no one period has any business looking at this film, unless you want a really good laugh. We don't feel bad about that, since we know we are not laughing at the real Padre Pio, but a complete misrepresentation of him. You would think the film was produced by a complete atheist who didn't know a thing about the Church and who merely wanted to ""cash in"" on the Padre Pio industry--rather like Ignatius Press. Time to withdraw support from Ignatius Press, one of the biggest rip-off companies in the U.S..  This film shows how little the man-made religion of Vatican II has in common with Catholicism.",1262995200,12,2003,4.789017341040463
3746111,3,B001PB3NWU,"This film and the Padre Pio with Sergio Castellitto seem to have much in common.  Both are biographies of Padre Pio, both were Italian miniseries around 3 hours long from the early 2000's.  Both have rather sensational and overwrought material.  Both end up with rather young actors in secondary roles ludicrously aging via bad make up jobs.  Both bring in a female interest, which seems a real stretch in both films.  However, in the end I was just floored by Castellitto's performance and the other film in general.  It just works much better than this one.  As an agnostic reared as a Catholic, I'm both attracted and repelled by the material.  The obvious trap with this story is to be overly sentimental and hokey, and to constantly have the inspirational music (which sounds similar in both films) swell up as Padre Pio stares up at the cross.  Padre Pio, Miracle Man, was just more convincing.  I think Castellitto deserves much of the credit.  The German actor who plays the inquistor priest is also wonderful in that film, and he is another major talent.  With the Castellito film I felt finally drawn in and caught up by it, but this film just seemed more contrived and predictable to me.  I wavered between 2 and 3 stars, but I just didn't enjoy this like I did the other film.",1261180800,33,1288,4.621145374449339
3746112,5,B001PB3NWU,"I just returned the 1st copy I got, this is the 2nd one I get and it is the same as the 1st one; scene 12 doesn't play at all,form that point on it skips-gets stuck. I suggested Amazon to contact Ignatius Press (I will email them as well). 2 DVD's same result. You might get lucky and get a good DVD =)

3746146,3,B001PB3NWU,"This film did not have a good script, and was not impressed with Placido  playing .Padra Pio.  The other film  Padra Pio, Miracle Man was excellent. The script and director were excellent, along with Castellinos who was perfect for the part of Padra Pio. The supporting actors were excellent, along with the cinematography, lighting, interior design, and a wonderful, musical score.,

I only watched part of the film with Michele Placido, and was disappointed in what I saw.",1458604800,3,474,5.038461538461538

3746149,5,B001PB3NWU,The story of Padre Pio:Between Heaven and Earth was the 1st DVD of this Saint's story that I had ever seen.  I was amazed at the depth of his conviction to treat people with kindness even though they were persecuting him.  His biggest complainers about his life were Catholic priests who didn't want to believe in his holiness. He treated the criticism with the ability to still treat them with respect all the while they weren't being considerate of him. The DVD is 3 hours long with English subtitles.  It's a good movie.,1444953600,2,523,4.602150537634409

3746151,5,B001PB3NWU,Padre Pio has always been of great interest to me because of his incredible spiritual gifts and great holiness as a famous stigmatic monk and contemporary saint.  This movie tells the whole story of this beloved man from his birth up to the place of his grave where millions of pilgrims visit him annually.

what an individual. If you have a devotion to him, or even if you don't, you should watch
it. So good, can be a bit slow  in places but that is OK. Can cause tears. Made me

3746183,5,B001PB3NWU,"Michele Placido has captured the powerful spirit of Padre Pio. It is always a joy to see a good film of the Life of Padre Pio who was still alive when I studied in Italy many years ago. Would that I had been able to visit him!

3746235,5,B001PB3NWU,"Who are these Catholic saints we come across in our churches, literature, and music? We are told they went through every trial and temptation we go through, resisted and overcame them to go all out for God.
Here we have Francesco Forgione from Pietreleina, Italy, a Capuchin priest at the age of 23. In his lifetime he heard confessions of thousands of people, people from all over the world, and through his prayers many of the sick were healed and their faith renewed.
Through his devotion to Jesus, the Gospels, and Saint Michael, his patron saint, he received the Stigmata, the wounds of Jesus on the cross, in his hands, feet, and side. News of all this spread and spiritual seekers came by the thousands to attend his Mass.
He made five demands of the serious spiritual seekers --- daily Mass and Communion, weekly confession. spiritual reading and meditation, examination of conscience, and, of course, the Rosary. ""The Rosary is our weapon against evil,"" he said. ""Prayer is life, an attitude, a deep friendship with Christ. Pray, hope, and don't worry.""
In 2002 Pope John Paul II, a longtime devotee of this holy man, canonized him as Saint Pio of Pietreleina.",1364428800,15,1169,4.82089552238806
