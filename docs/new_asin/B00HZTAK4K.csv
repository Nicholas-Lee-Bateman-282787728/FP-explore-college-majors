8637634,1,B00HZTAK4K,"I had already purchased Fit as a Pro which had a different picture/cover. I really liked the first one so I was excited that she had a new video out, and wanted to try it. Come to find out it was the EXACT SAME WORKOUT disguised as something different. So essentially I was conned into paying $20.00 for a workout I had already purchased. Very disappointing.",1524182400,,358,4.4393939393939394

8637637,5,B00HZTAK4K,"I started with the warm up and did the full body workout and the cardio one. They were very helpful and right to the target, fast and efficient.
The next day I had a sore leg which indicates it worked!!
I liked it and for sure will have with me whenever I am on production and don't have time to go to the gym.

8637638,5,B00HZTAK4K,I like a workout where the trainer is professional. This one is just that. Not a  lot of stupid chatter like so many work out dvd's include.,1402272000,2,140,4.185185185185185
8637639,5,B00HZTAK4K,"I've been looking for great at home workouts for a while and these are perfect! Because all 5 workouts are 10 minute circuits you can choose one for a quick workout or combine them all for an intense 50 minute sweat session. I have equipment at home, but because these workouts only use your body weight I find that this DVD is my favorite go-to! Bikini season here I come!!",1400976000,,374,4.357142857142857
8637640,5,B00HZTAK4K,"Lauren seems to know what she is doing here. There is a reason she is an Olympic athlete. However, the workout is easy enough to understand and follow so that the everyday person that wants to drop some pounds, tone up and increase their cardiovascular capacity and endurance will be able to. You can pick and choose which exercises to do and the whole set-up and scenery makes this for a very complete fitness video, one of the best ones I have seen. I am an exercise physiologist and conditioning coach and have to say these workout routines make completely sense from an anatomical and physiological perspective, unlike many falvor-of-the-month type videos. Next up I will be purchasing the second DVD.",1391558400,2,705,4.8347107438016526
8637641,5,B00HZTAK4K,"It's thorough and tough.
I like how she exhibits each movement.
The scenery is beautiful too. Makes for an excellent overall video.",1391299200,2,131,5.0
