8647530,5,B00J2PQZFS,"Critics of this film argue that this film doesn't utilise hard political analysis; this is well refuted by Judith Crist, Robert K. Brigham, George C. Herring and Ngo Vinh Long in the excellent and updated liner notes that accompany its re-issue. Hearts and Minds is designed to be profoundly upsetting and shocking. Bearing in mind when it came out - before the Vietnam War had ended - it is amazing the lengths the filmmakers went to provoke the viewer. The American people obviously needed an alternative take shoved into their faces than one the five previous administrations had fed it. The film was probably a major influence on Francis Ford Coppola and Stanley Kubrick. Footage here is extremely up close and personal, as well as graphic: it includes soldiers having sex in a brothel (filmed two feet away from the participants), as well as live film footage that two iconic Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs captured during the war: South Vietnam's chief of National Police, Nguyn Ngc Loan, shooting handcuffed prisoner Nguyn Vn Lm in the head (the photo shows only the instant the bullet hit the head, while the camera, shockingly, continues tracking the executed man falling on the  ground, with blood fountaining out of his temple) and the nine year old girl, Phan Th Kim Phc, running naked down the road (the film footage shows the skin peeling off her back) after a napalm strike.

Both sides are given the opportunity to explain themselves, supporters and detractors. But there is ample footage of Pentagon officials hanging themselves with their own rope and supporters of the Vietnam war (on both sides) do not come off looking particularly sensible. This isn't a nine-hour documentary like Shoah. The point that the Americans were there for their own colonial and imperialist reasons is made clearly and polemically within the two-hour time frame, superbly edited down from over 200 hours of footage. This film is why the Pentagon will never again allow journalists to freely report from the front. The picture is authentically preserved and presented - the raw, grainy documentary footage looks exactly how it was in the cinema 40 years ago - it's not going to resemble a modern Hollywood blockbuster (compare it to Werner Herzog's documentaries). The supplemental features, featuring Davis' commentary and over two hours of unused footage, are also superb.",1467849600,7,2375,5.087179487179487

8647535,5,B00J2PQZFS,"I was there in country 1968-69, a very young 21-year old American 1st Lieutenant artillery forward observer (from Detroit, Michigan) who was consistently assigned to patrol (weeks on end) with South Vietnamese Army infantry units. All these many decades later, I find myself a retirement-age graduate student pursuing a Masters degree in Public History at the University of Massachusetts Boston. This semester's class (Archives Practice) has me working on the papers of ""Hearts and Minds"" producer Bert Scnneider in conjunction with the archive collection of H & M director, Peter Davis. I so proudly wave the American Flag, but I do so because only in America can a justified damnation of a horrible waste of lives be so tragically and graphically presented to a new generation of Americans who need to know the truth. Please buy this DVD, watch it, and show it to your friends and adult family members. And then read the headlines about political (non-veteran) war hawks who want to send your children and/or grandchildren into a foreign war zone because it makes for rabid-news sound bites for those trying to raise campaign funds (right-wingers trying to sound tougher than the next guy).",1426118400,13,1192,5.086734693877551

8647537,5,B00J2PQZFS,"My verdict on this Criterion release must be a mixed one for those contemplating purchasing it themselves. About the content of the film, itself, I have no misgivings--it was a brave, passionate polemical document in 1975, when both Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra reportedly denounced it from the same Academy Awards stage on which its makers accepted the Oscar for best feature-length documentary and the final victory of the North Vietnamese rendered the whole issue moot. Today and ever after, it remains an invaluable history of a time of which subsequent generations will have to be reminded. Nevertheless, for those in however small a minority who already own Criterion's initial DVD-only release, the purchase of this new combination blu ray/DVD version cannot, in my opinion, be justified. Even the newest footage was shot in 1973 and much more of it is historical and so benefits little from whatever upgrade the blu ray resolution may provide. Moreover, the added supplementary material--both extensions of interviews already in the documentary and the testimony of a few additional witnesses (eg., George Ball)-- cannot, again in my opinion, justify re-purchasing this title. So, by all means, get it if you don't already have it. But think twice about replacing your existing copy with this one.",1407196800,9,1303,5.20952380952381
8647538,5,B00J2PQZFS,"My wonderful high school history teacher, sometime in the early 1980s, showed us this film so that we could learn about the culture and effect of Vietnam on our country and on the Vietnamese people. I have remembered it ever since and am thrilled it is available now. My children ask me about Vietnam, why it happened, what it was like, and why so many people were so passionate about it. This documentary speaks to those questions and I am glad I can now show it to them.",1403308800,12,472,4.375
