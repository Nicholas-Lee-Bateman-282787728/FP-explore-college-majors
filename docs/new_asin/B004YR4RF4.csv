I would recommend this tool as an excellent way for a Greek bilingual parent to have an audio and visual guide to help teach the Greek language fundamentals",1354579200,,451,4.7215189873417724

4503150,5,B004YR4RF4,"This dvd was a gift to my nieces (age 3 and 5). I studied, speak, and love Modern Greek and wanted them to learn some words through songs. They love the songs so much!!! The dvd is exceptionally well made: fun, educational, creative, and colorful. They soon learned many Greek words through these funny songs. THANKS to Papaloizos Publications!!!!!!!! GREAT JOB!!!!!!!!",1347408000,2,369,5.065573770491803
4503151,5,B004YR4RF4,My baby loves this! He is 11 months now and we watch together 2x a week! His dad is Greek and said the accent and language is excellent.,1335139200,2,136,3.892857142857143
8448781,1,B004YR4RF4,"Not good at all! The whole DVD was horrible.  Ugly puppets, annoying voices and fast incoherent dialogue.  It was unbearable.
The whole video is basically two puppets that are supposed to be ""school children"" and a monster puppet that is supposed to be a ""teacher"". None of the puppets are engaging or interesting. Although they are supposed to be school age, the voices are like adults. The voices are native Greek speakers and they speak quite fast and use words that a beginner would find hard to keep up with. The interaction between the three puppets is very boring and annoying. Also the awful music that is played in the background is too loud at times and drowns out a lot of what is being said.  The little ""songs"" that they use to sing the alphabet or vocabulary words and other topics are really bad! They are basically just saying the words or letters with awful music being played. None of the songs have any  imagination or rhythm.

 I think this could have been a really good learning DVD for kids, but unfortunately needs A LOT of work! Its unfortunate, because I have been searching for something fun to help teach my 3yr old niece and nephew Greek.",1455753600,,1166,4.581730769230769
8448782,5,B004YR4RF4,"My daughter is obsessed with this DVD. I try to limit her screen time to a minimum, so she watches it a little bit at a time. She loves the professor and the songs. This DVD even helped get through her stage during teething when she didn't want to take her bottle. She would get hypnotized by the puppets and not even realize she was taking her bottle. Maybe my husband will even learn some Greek too!",1454544000,,401,4.220779220779221
8448783,4,B004YR4RF4,My kids love this DVD. My 1 year old dances and watches and my 4 year old has already started saying some words after only a few days.,1447977600,,134,3.8214285714285716
8448784,5,B004YR4RF4,"I bought this DVD for my son and enjoyed it so much, I got 2 more for my niece and godson! Speedy delivery, too!",1447372800,,112,3.7083333333333335
8448785,4,B004YR4RF4,"I have been searching for a good Greek children's learning dvd for my daughter for a while. The options are pretty limited. Even on YouTube, the Greek children's shows aren't teaching much other than having children dressed up and singing adult songs about love and life. I don't see my toddler learning much from those shows.  I was a little put off by the price of this dvd, plus shipping. When it arrived, I was worried that the packaging was very cheap. It's just a dvd in a cardboard sleeve. All that aside, I think it's a great dvd and I'm glad I found it. It's good quality with Greek and English subtitles. It teaches the alphabet, numbers, shapes, colors, greetings, and much more. I'm confident that this will help my daughter learn Greek. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer.",1423440000,,797,4.534722222222222

8448788,2,B004YR4RF4,"I can't buy this for any Greek Orthodox family. The 'Days of the Week' song ignores God when it talks about Sunday, saying 'On Sundays I like to sleep in and play!' The following song (`The Church')  talks about God but refers to Christ and God as two separate beings, instead of one and the same. I expected so much more from Papaloizos since their books talk about Christ and the Orthodox Church in a positive way, unlike this DVD. The rest of the songs are cute although not perfect. In one scene, the professor is outside in the snow and says 'Ti zesti!' which means 'How hot it is!' In another part, the boy Niko is defiant and disobedient to his teacher when asked to take a quiz. I emailed the publisher months ago, without any response. Yes, I want my children to learn Greek but learning about the love of God and obedience to their elders is much more important! What a shame that Papaloizos allowed their name to appear on such a product. Ti krima :(",1365811200,2,961,4.368715083798882
8448789,5,B004YR4RF4,"My little girl loves this disc, and so do we (mom and dad).  She's going on 3 and was already reasonably interested in Greek before because of her grandparents and the books I've brought her from Greece.  But now that we have this dvd to rely on, her interest level is sky-high!  She knows all her letters and has even more interest in the Greek books we have around the house.  She knows her colors, etc, and sings the songs to herself as part of her regular repertoire.

Everything is so nicely done, and frankly it's so relaxing and soothing we just sit there with her and enjoy it.  We are so happy it doesn't have any annoying super-fast editing (we can't stand that) or any hoaky ""cool"" images that would be better for older children.

We highly recommend this dvd and wish the makers would come up with more!!",1363478400,,816,4.4
8448790,5,B004YR4RF4,"I bought this CD as a Christmas present for my one year old niece who is half Greek, and she loves it!  It is very entertaining, and a great introduction to the Greek language. I highly recommend it as part of the ""toolbox""  for parents (or family members) who want their children to learn Greek.  I am so glad I found this CD.",1360281600,,327,4.158730158730159
