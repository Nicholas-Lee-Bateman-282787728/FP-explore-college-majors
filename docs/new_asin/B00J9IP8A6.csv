6347158,5,B00J9IP8A6,"this anime is interesting, three kids with special powers are brought to another world to use their powers to help play games, however these aren't your normal games of chance and luck like poker. In these games you play for keeps. The anime does have a slight flaw in that it is pretty short, and leaves off with room for more, but I am content with what i'm given and definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for something interesting to watch.",1409443200,2,455,4.560975609756097
6347159,4,B00J9IP8A6,"Problem Children is a good series, but definitely one where many of the ""why's"" about character background are gone unanswered. I personally didn't mind, but it would have been nice to have some of that explained. Basically, we have 3 main characters that are pulled into a place called little garden, where the inhabitants live under different banners, or communities. The different communities participate in ""games"" to win various beneficial ""gifts"" for their respective community. There are some pretty good battles in this series and also some very good art as well. This fell a bit short of 5 stars for me only because of the lack of a cohesive backstory. I like the goal they are working towards (restoring their community's stolen banner), and the characters are memorable, also the english dub was not bad. The artwork was top notch and the ending song is great. Overall, if you can handle a bit of unexplained backstory (I hope all otaku at this point can) and some minimal fanservice, this should be a good watch. Support the American anime market and pick this series up! Worth the money!",1409270400,,1100,4.8563829787234045
6347160,4,B00J9IP8A6,"Despite the missing upskirt panty shot type of fanservice, Problem Children turned out to be one of the more entertaining (as well as maybe the smartest) anime during its time. And the so-called ""problem children"" aren't really so much the problem as they are smart-mouthed and minor bullies (to poor Black Rabbit); they're actually quite heroic and friendly.

We could wonder why this show did so poorly in Japan. We can also rack our heads as to why ""No Game No Life"" did better than this show. However; as I told the people behind the ""anti-piracy effort on anime:"" If anime companies made more anime like this title; where the males aren't spineless and were more successful in their goals, then more people outside of Japan would buy anime.

Peace to Josh Grelle (Freezing's Kazuya Aoi), Jessica Calvello (Ikki Tousen's Ekitoku Chouhi), Brittney Karbowski (Pani Poni Dash!'s Himeko Katagiri), Nancy Novotny (Azumanga Daioh's Koyomi ""Yomi"" Mizuhara), Luci Christian, Hillary Haag, et al for the wild ride of an English Dub.",1407715200,,1027,5.035294117647059

6347162,4,B00J9IP8A6,"Izayoi Sakamaki, Asuka Kudou, and You Kasukabe are ""special"". They each have a strange ability and find themselves discontent with their everyday life. One day they receive invitations from to different world called ""Little Garden"" and are suddenly transported there where the sender of the invitations, Black Rabbit, explains that the world centers around playing games.

This series is great entertainment. If you stop and think about it too much it sort of falls apart, but if you just sit back and relax you can have a very enjoyable experience. The plot is not complicated. The characters are not deep. The world isn't even really explained all that well. But watching a bunch of super powered and super confident teens set loose in a magical world where everything is decided through games is pretty fun. Izayoi was especially fun due to his ability.

The series is kind of short with only 10 episodes. It ends in such a way that a sequel could be done, but doesn't have to be done (I would like to see more though).

Also, the ending credits have the characters dancing in chibi form. Its funny.",1397692800,16,1102,4.7591623036649215
6347163,5,B00J9IP8A6,If only there were a second season.  I really wanted to see this story develop more.,1444176000,,84,4.25

6347166,5,B00J9IP8A6,It was a good anime but needs a second season to it,1435795200,,51,3.3333333333333335
6347167,5,B00J9IP8A6,"If 4 1/2 was possible I would definitely give it-it XD
It is so like no game no life which I am pre ordering the dub is not as great as the Japanese dub for no game no life an a little goes to problem children: the Japanese cast. Get you.. more into anime but if only the dubbed version from sentai filmworks delivered that ;( it might had made it better  worth .... the money! ;(
If they offered a giant poster and a CD of the Japanese cast singing in English it would been more worth the $40 bucks.. too
Damn bad I guess We Have to try more to enjoy no game no life and problem children: without really liking the dub
But this show all involves with this guy the same for no game no life which get to live in a world where to survive you need to know how to over kill at games
That you can make or follow by someone else after that it gets more physical in problem children: less so for no game no life but the difference is this was based on Loli
And no game no life is based on Loli?
Umm I mean... no game no life involves' ecchi! where this only has one episode which was a ova which involved ecchi
If you plan to get this it is funny a little but. Not much is to say; it for one is not family rated. Or for sure so not for girls as even I a guy find this show a little unsettling
But  nonetheless is worth trying out",1433635200,,1322,3.838827838827839

8649036,1,B00J9IP8A6,"its a very terrible series, i don't enjoy cocky arrogant overpowered lead characters, the thing i look for in anime characters are that they are humble and well grounded i mean naruto, natsu, ichigo, luffy have all may have been over powered but it took time with many conflicts and struggles to get them where they are in there driven lives but izayoi is just a cocky over powered dbag whom i guess wanted too come off as funny but end up comming off condensending and cause of his character trait i care nothing for this anime at all",1458345600,,535,4.414141414141414
8649037,5,B00J9IP8A6,"Problem children are coming from another world, aren't they? Is a rather fun anime to watch, the series itself feels rushed in they eleven episodes from this blu ray DVD and that might turn people off but I say I really enjoyed watching this series. The animation is good as well, nothing outstanding but still nice to look at and take in",1449014400,,338,4.467741935483871
