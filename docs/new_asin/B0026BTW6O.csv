8513919,4,B0026BTW6O,My son loves this video.  He is 3 now and had some speech delays.  He started humming the theme song and repeating some of lessons he saw on this video.  He also started applying the lessons to other books and things he saw.  It's very educational and fun.  He loves it as well as my neice and nephew.,1245196800,,301,4.120689655172414
