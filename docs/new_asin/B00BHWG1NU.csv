5622104,5,B00BHWG1NU,"From the first time we watched Team Umizoomi, I knew it was a show I definitely wouldn't mind my kids watching.  The show is first off so colorful and features adorable little main characters that I knew my kids would want to watch it.  Second though is the educational benefits from it.  The show teams teamwork, patterns, shapes, and numbers.  This particular DVD features 91 minutes of Team Umizoomi adventures and it is broken down into four episodes.

Purple Monkey Mission
Buster the Lost Dog
Cuckoo Bears
Animal School House!

As you can probably tell from the names of the episodes and the DVD, this title is all about animals.  Each episode has an animal that the Umizoomi help and it was adorable to see all these episodes on one DVD.  While these are episodes that have been on television, I don't think we had seem any of them previously.  The animation is super adorable and the music gets my kids excited and moving.

I received this title to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1367884800,25,1006,4.632768361581921

This Movie Digital is $11.99.

Each Umizoomi episode is $1.99 each.

This ""movie is nothing more than 4 Normal Animal Episodes of Umizoomi

This ""movie"" Cost me $4.03 more than I wanted to spend. Technically, you can buy a whole season of Umizoomi for 2x the cost of this movie.

I am opening a case with amazon to get my money back and remove this title. No parent should be subject to this ""new release"" garbage

Do not buy this. Instead buy...
