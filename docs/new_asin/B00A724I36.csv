Every piece was beautifully created and I loved that it was a family affair. It was refreshing to see so many dancers in a new light and even though I love Hollywood dance there was a level of grace, and purity that you don't always see in the movies or television. I am so thankful this piece was shared and I loved sharing it with my family and friends also.",1357689600,4,508,4.141414141414141

5391781,2,B00A724I36,"I am a crazy fan of pretty much any dancer from So You Think You Can Dance.  Therefore, I was looking forward to seeing Twitch, Jaime Goodwin, Kathryn Mccormick, Allison Holker, and Janaya French.  The cover art of Twitch and Allison is so beautiful.  They not only didn't do that pose in the documentary, I didn't even spot Allison at all.  The performance was strange and repetitive to me.  Not my cup of tea at all, and I love to watch dance.  I guess it was artistic, but not in a way that I understood at all.",1355616000,3,514,4.247422680412371

Story line: Unique, captivating.  Raw talent at work and a score seamless with the story and dancers.  Couldn't be a more perfect blend....Location: Superb, entertaining, spot on.

8547630,4,B00A724I36,Great dvd to show student dancers. Theyre interested in these dancers- its current and relevant. They see mostly good studio behaviors and practices.

8547636,1,B00A724I36,I'm in the process of putting a show together so I couldn't wait to see this documentary!! Maybe give some ideas or any steps I was missing and the DVD was so lame and boring! I love the cast and really wish that it was better but it really wasn't! Save your money and watch a YouTube video!,1368144000,,291,4.0344827586206895
8547637,5,B00A724I36,"I need to watch this at lease 2-3 more times to grasp it as when I was reading the ""Plato's Allegory of the Cave"" years ago in college it took reading line by line to comprehend it. The meanings behind this project are so deep and intricate gives it a deep artistic perspective.

It was fantastic seeing how challenging this project was on the dancers and how they performed. While I would have loved to see this with a few more months of practice I admire the 7 day project and what it was.

Pro's - Seeing professional dancers work in a challenging environment and timeframe come out up with something artistic. They were beautiful, grotesque, beast, and everything in between giving a wide range of fantastic emotions. Giving a clear depiction of the meaning that is behind the dance.

Con's - 7 Days is not a lot of time to fully grasp a role, and at times the improv felt confusing while the choreographed moments were spot on.

End to end a worth while watch several times over... The dancers give a clear depiction of the project as it is just as complex as and deep as the meaning of it. Watch it, buy it, get a hard copy or digital... Just do it.",1367798400,6,1155,4.358139534883721
