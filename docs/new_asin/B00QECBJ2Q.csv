I stopped watching it after the third episode because I saw that it was following the same pattern as Iljamae, and I don't like or enjoy watching injustice. I know the writers make the ambitious people really bad so that everyone is feeling good when they get their just rewards. But watching a faithful government employee, who has sacrificially served and lost family members due to his job, then their king turns around and slanders them, causing him and his family to lose their good name, their title, their property and their freedom, by turning innocent people into slaves, is not a story I want to watch ever again. Leaders who treat people like that, should not be in those positions of authority. I chose the drama because I like watching a particular actor, but it's not worth my time or emotions. As far as acting goes, it seemed to be okay. If I continued watching the series and got past the tragic scenes, I probably would have given it more stars. By the way, what I saw of this film, I watched on dramafever.",1490313600,,1082,4.525510204081633
8691042,2,B00QECBJ2Q,"As a fancier of kdramas and wanting to spend the winter idle time to watch this, and another, straight through, it was saved for just the right time; it is not watchable and is most likely a knock-off. The actors,scenes, story are all great as are the subtitles but what is not is the ""KBS2"" in the upper right corner, not so much a distraction as is,however, the bouncing yellow avatar that keeps doing back-flips and jumping jacks followed by a steady picture of what appears to be the Korean Broadcast System's evening news anchors. Add the constant crawlers across the bottom and it become too many distractions for someone to get fully involved with. Whomever did this is playing us for suckers and Amazon.com should be aware of it.",1451520000,,737,4.676923076923077

8691045,5,B00QECBJ2Q,"As someone who is a fan of Lee Joon Gi (he is a fantastic actor) I make sure that I purchase all of his dramas, movies, and music.  This was a really great drama and I would recommend it to anyone who is a Korean drama watcher.  Lee Joon Gi was GREAT in this program, loved all of his action moves - his fighting scenes and rifle handling scenes were just fantastic.",1425168000,,366,4.069444444444445
