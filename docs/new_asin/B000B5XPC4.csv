8082034,5,B000B5XPC4,"Richard Greene was one of those actors who made the legend of Robin Hood believable.  His exceptional acting ability and positive attitude comes through to reflect his glowing character.  His Robin Hood series brings to life one of my many childhood heroes who I emulated during my youth.  I urge any parent who would like to offer their family an inspirational video series they can watch together, or entrust to their children, this Robin Hood series is one-such collection.  Richard Greene gives his all to make this series one of the all-time greats and a must for all tasteful, quality, video libraries.",1295481600,,608,4.931372549019608
8082035,5,B000B5XPC4,Living in England during King Richard - and before Prince John signed the Magna Carter - the poor people were robbed of their hard earned money to help the rich keep the lifestyle,1222646400,,179,4.454545454545454
8082036,2,B000B5XPC4,"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now.  They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it.  However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors.  Also the sound is very bad.  Some of the plots are a little boring.  But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality.  I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't.  I just wish it was easier to watch.",1169337600,,505,4.040404040404041
8082037,5,B000B5XPC4,"I purchased from Amazon.co.uk each of the four seasons of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" - all 143 episodes - for about $20 per season.

Digital transfer was excellent and our entire family has enjoyed the series. Packaging involved sturdy plastic cases, each containing 2 DVD's, with 8 episodes per disk. I found this a great value and wanted to recommend it to others interested in the Robin Hood series.",1147219200,,406,4.8
8082038,5,B000B5XPC4,"Another batch of Robin Hood episodes with some of the better shows of the series.

HUBERT is the tale of a less than inspiring knight who loves a woman promised to a norman supporter of Prince John.

MY BROTHER'S KEEPER is an excellent tale of a brother murdering another and Robin's attempt to expose the murder without compromising himself.  We get a glimpse of a traditional Lenten observence in Ancient England in this one.

AN APPLE FOR THE ARCHER tells the tale of an archery contest for the hand of a lady.  This episode is notable for teaching how an arrow and bow is made during that time.  That alone makes the episode worth your money.

THE SHERIFF'S BOOTS tells the story of a villege who's bootmakers are compeating with the mrechants of Nottingham.  One of the more entertaining episdoes of the whole series.  One of the 11 episodes with Rufas Cruikshank in the role of Little John.

Like all the others it is very worth your time and money.",1141516800,2,955,4.564705882352941
