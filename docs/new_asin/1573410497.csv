The speaker is certainly a master of presentation and has a firm grasp of geology, chemistry, plate tectonics, climatology, genetics, biology, and quotes modern scientists over and over, but points out how twisted their logic is in trying to deny the existence of God, which is all evolution really is.  The truth is out there; just watch who interprets the available facts!",1123113600,,431,4.972222222222222

Not only does he systematically dismantle the religion of evolution, but he exposes the lies that have been covering up the truth for so many, many years.  Very enlightening to say the least!  Kent equips his audience with a formidable evolution-refuting arsenal of information!  It's no wonder most evolutionists try their best to avoid debating Kent Hovind!",1071705600,4,408,5.428571428571429

The presenter uses humor in addition to the scientific presentation.  My 10 year old was able to enjoy it along with me.
I highly recommend this video.",1053043200,9,304,4.509090909090909
