7905271,3,B000007TCV,"This is a three-hour collection of vintage short films with holiday themes. Many of these were produced especially for the home-movie market (""Howdy Doody's Christmas"" is a live-action hoot with comedian  Dayton Allen as the villain; other shorts are less impressive, with syrupy,  low-budget stories involving visits from Santa Claus). These home-movie  shorts will be a nostalgic treat for baby boomers. The theatrical shorts,  like the sing-along color cartoon ""Snow Foolin,"" are very  enjoyable. This extended-play cassette is technically very good, with a  variety of ""color tones"" subtly mellowing the black-and-white  subjects.",944438400,,634,5.826086956521739
