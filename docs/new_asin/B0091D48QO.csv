5241583,5,B0091D48QO,My sister loves the movie and has bee requesting it for years for Christmas. I was unable to find it anywhere until this Christmas. She was so excited to get it as a gift!,1363737600,7,171,4.0588235294117645
5241584,4,B0091D48QO,Love this old Christmas tale done with a different take.  This plus Susan Lucci and you can go wrong.  Merry Christmas.,1361577600,,119,4.619047619047619
5241585,4,B0091D48QO,"I have seen most of the movies that are based on Charles Dickens' ""Christmas Carol, and in my opinion this one ranks up there with the better ones.  The interesting thing is, of course, that in this case Scrooge is a woman, capably portrayed by Susan Lucci.  Actually, most of the other roles are taken by women.  An interesting idea.",1360454400,,334,4.533333333333333
5241586,5,B0091D48QO,"I fell in love with Ebbie portrayed by Susan Lucci, when it first came out. Been hoping it would eventually be released on dvd. Now it is. I love it.. Thank you so much",1359158400,2,168,3.9705882352941178

5241588,5,B0091D48QO,"I watched this movie back in the 90's when it first appeared, and even taped it.  Over the years, the tape deteriorated to the point it was unwatchable.  I've been looking for quite some time for a replacement and found it here on Amazon.

The video quality is about 7/10 and the audio 8/10.  That said, the lack of top quality does not detract from the movie itself.  The setting may be dated (90's computers, no cell phones, etc.) but the story of a driven woman who gives up her personal life for business success rings true even today.  Wendy Crewson, in on of her earlier roles, is excellent as Ebbie's personal secretary, Roberta Cratchit.  Yes, the lines get a bit hokey at times, but hey, it's Christmas and we all need a little hokey!

I simply love this gender-roles-reversed tale of redemption!!!",1357603200,,807,4.594405594405594
5241589,4,B0091D48QO,"It was not the best, but the acting was good.  I wouldn't pay a lot for it, but I'm glad I bought it for my collection.",1356912000,2,119,3.576923076923077
5241590,5,B0091D48QO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It lends a modern twist to an old theme.  Susan Lucci gave an outstanding performance as Ebbie - a die-hard business woman who remembers what Christmas is all about and becomes a blessing to the people in her life who had not given up on her despite her negative qualities. I'm glad I was able to track this down - It is now near the top of my ""Christmas movies I must watch"" list. Oh, and guys - don't let the female lead scare you off. We watched at my guy's suggestion - he loves it as much as i do.",1354752000,8,535,4.047169811320755

5241604,5,B0091D48QO,"I got this as a gift for my mother, who used to have it recorded. Last year we watched it on Youtube, and on a whim I decided to look it up on Amazon. I immediately decided that I needed to order this!

I found that the image and sound quality to be very good; there was nothing 'meh' about it.

My mother was ecstatic, and exclaimed that it was the same version that she had seen when it was on T.V.

It was a wonderful early Christmas gift and I would highly recommend this to anybody.

Note: The songs are on the DVD, which may or may not be obvious. The case does have the 'Bonus 10' on it. I don't believe that we are going to be putting the DVD into the player just to listen to Christmas music. However, this one was less expensive than the version of the movie that did not come with songs.",1452643200,,798,4.0
5241605,3,B0091D48QO,Love the fact that you can buy this movie on DVDs now as you can't even see it on tv anymore. It didn't need to come with the MP3 songs on the disc but it doesn't take away from the movie at all.,1452124800,,195,3.558139534883721

5241607,5,B0091D48QO,"Elizabeth ""Ebbie"" Scrooge (Susan Lucci) is the tyrant that owns Dobson's Department Store.
She takes her career v-e-r-y seriously, cares little about Christmas, and, even l-e-s-s about  those
around her, unless it'll turn a profit. Three sets of ghosts set her on the straight and narrow road.
I give this---full screen---[Disney Chanel] movie one star for EACH time I shed a tear in 90-minutes,
that'd be five.
Please remember that MY two favorite seasons of the year [see my profile photo] are Hallowe'en
and Christmas. I've dressed up like THE Frankenstein Monster, a-n-d Santa, but I draw the line on
The Easter Bunny!
A, superior, re-telling of the old tale about Mister Scrooge... Tiny Tim still sings olde Christmas carols,
and the rest of the crowd... updated for the 21st Century, dance to Percy Sledge's WHEN A MAN
LOVES A WOMAN, and, a cover-band does a great version of the familiar THAT'S THE WAY---ah ha,
ah ha---I LIKE IT! Indeed!",1451347200,,945,4.90625
5241608,4,B0091D48QO,"I collect film versions of A Christmas Carol.  Its fascinating seeing the different ways that filmmakers have butchered Dickens famous tale.  In this case, they made the main character a coldhearted woman (soap star legend Susan Lucci as Ebbie).  Instead of ghosts or spirits haunting her, shes stuck with employees showing up to give her grief.  That alone makes for a bizarre twist on the story.  The whole point in having holiday spirits representing the different aspects of time is that they are by their nature otherworldly.  In this case, Ebbie is haunted by two perfume spritzing clerks, a package wrapper, and the store security guard that she fired just hours earlier.  The only one dead as a doornail is Marley (Jeffrey DeMunn).  Otherwise, most of the plot is intact.  There is a Tiny Tim.  But theres a niece instead of a nephew.  You could quibble over the finer points but none of that really matters because its all about Susan Lucci.  And she manages to make a very convincing Scrooge.  I enjoyed watching it.  More to the point, it goes into my collection of movies based on the classic.",1449705600,,1105,4.747368421052632

She would have me record it on my DVR every year at Christmas and come over to watch it with the family. Buying it gave us a way to enjoy the movie without commercials and parts being edited out.

5241637,4,B0091D48QO,"I'm not a Susan Lucci fan at all and honestly, I wasn't going to watch this movie because of it, but years ago, when it was on TV I enjoyed it so much!  She plays the mean workaholic career woman perfectly and she does a great job portraying what probably many career women are really like even today.  (I can say I know a few of them! )

This is a great Christmas story with an important lesson for everyone to learn.  Amazon is the only place I found to purchase it.
Thanks Amazon!",1417219200,,483,4.1063829787234045
5241638,4,B0091D48QO,"This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  Susan Lucci, well known for her Emmy-Award winning role on the daytime soap opera ""All My Children"" (as Erica Kane) stars in this update of ""A Christmas Carol"" as ""Ebbie"" a department store supervisor who only cares about turning a profit and doesn't care about people.  Her nasty, ungenerous ways cause her to be visited by three spirits (the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Future) and well you can figure out the rest from there.

This movie was first broadcast on television (I think on Lifetime TV network) in 1995 and has been replayed annually ever since.  Lucci does a remarkable job in the title role and shows her range as an actress. She is remarkable.

It is appropriate for the whole family to watch and is really a good movie.",1417219200,5,793,4.635714285714286

Susan Lucci - she's so good at what she does.  I thoroughly enjoy her in this movie and also Wendy Crew who has done so many good things in movies.  The guys who play Jake Marley and Ebbie's ""squeeze"" Paul are good additions, nice acting.  It's an all around good movie.
