8701850,4,B00THX0TCU,"Excellent, but in the meantime, technology has moved on.  With Fire TV Stick or similar, DVDs have almost become an oddity - still useful in automobiles and RVs, similar to CDs being replaced by memory sticks.  As technology jumps ahead - AGAIN - new methods and products provide better results.",1514332800,,295,4.88

8701853,2,B00THX0TCU,".... which is too bad since the movie selection itself is excellent and I would have enjoyed these if the DVDs were of better quality, not the shaky credits, grainy movie, weak sound, etc etc that can be experienced on all 3 discs in this set.  This will be going back and I'll try to get some of the better features on individual discs, if available.

I am especially disappointed since the ""Randolph Scott Roundup, v1"" (also by Mill Creek Entertainment) was very good indeed and I was obviously hoping this would be of a similar quality -- but it is NOT!",1501891200,,556,4.4411764705882355
