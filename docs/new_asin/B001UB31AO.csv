This is one of the very best documentaries ever made, yet it was honored when it came out (won a PRIMETIME EMMY award) and then ""disappeared"" curiously.... it appears at present (2012) no DVD package of the entire series is available.

The 12 part documentary includes the following episodes:

1. Remembering
3. Eating
7. Living
11. Creating
12. Trading

Seven other episodes are also part of the documentary.

Does anyone know of a DVD vendor which makes this entire series available?

The series is based on a book of the same name written by a famous Oxford U. intellectual/ artistic (performing artist) personality named Alasdair Clayre...see the Wikipidia bio article about him..... who sadly committed suicide in January 1984, the year his book also titled Heart Of The Dragon was published, and the year before the video series was released for broadcast and latter became available in VHS cassette form.

The fact that, almost 30 years later, it is not available for sale in the DVD format is astonishing.

There was a Wikipedia article describing the series, but it is now hard to find using the search term ""HEART OF THE DRAGON Wikipedia"" using WWW.Google. Com. Other movies have the same title, including a drama (Jackie Chan) movie made the same year...1985....the documentary was released.
