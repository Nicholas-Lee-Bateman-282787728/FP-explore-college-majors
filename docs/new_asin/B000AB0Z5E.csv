8077516,1,B000AB0Z5E,"Mantan Moreland is my favorite comedian, and would give him or anything he was in sixteen stars. The one star is for the ""Remastered"" A2ZCDS.com release. I have around 3,000 DVDs and over 1,000 Blu rays of different films. The A2ZCDS.com release of Chasing Trouble is by far the worst video I own! Lines almost through the entire movie, splice jumps, water spots, pops, jumps, ending cut off, etc. I don't remember ever seeing a VHS tape that looked this bad. Certainly NOT Remastered!
If your a hard core Mantan fan like me, get it, otherwise wait for a truly remastered edition. Sorry A2ZCDS for got me for almost $20.00, but I won't be back!",1438646400,,644,4.608695652173913
8077517,5,B000AB0Z5E,"This is an interesting comedy about a guy who tries to do the right thing but instead ends up with a lot of evil men out to kill him. He's saved in the end by an ace investigative reporter who uncovers the truth at the last minute so the bad guys can go to jail. It's a short, tight little film that goes straight from start to finish without wasting a lot of our time. It is well directed adn was well worth my time.",1154044800,6,417,3.9176470588235293
8077518,5,B000AB0Z5E,"It's amazing how short some of these older movies were. I guess because they were shown as double features or something they figured they could get away with only having them be about an hour long.

I would have liked this one to go on a bit longer because I really liked the characters and its a shame that it's' only as long as an average television show.

I'm not going to give it less stars just for that though because it delivers what it needs to deliver which is light romantic comedie with a little bit of suspense thrown in to keep the plot moving forward.

I'm sorta gettting into these older films without major stars, because I don't get distracted thinking about the major players.",1146873600,4,694,4.448818897637795
