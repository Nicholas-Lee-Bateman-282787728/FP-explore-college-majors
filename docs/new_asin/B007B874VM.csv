Anne Baring is a true visionary as well as a remarkable scholar, so there's much to be learned from her.  I felt like I'd dropped in the home in which the film was made for some Sunday afternoon conversation with anything included: God, gladiolas, gold, madness, Sun-god mythologies, Mother-civilization, and a thousand other things.  I think what is in this film is itself the basis of civilization - two friends wrapping their learning and their lives around each other to see what each has to offer the other.",1433462400,3,650,4.837837837837838
8513711,5,B007B874VM,"This is Anne Barings Magnum Opus, twenty years in the making and utterly amazing.  Beautifully written and easy to understand. Anyone who who asks the question 'Who are we?' and 'Why are we here?' should read this, if they are looking for something beyond the superficial values of our culture.  It is written from a personal quest perspective and also from  the historical and psychological causes that have brought us to our present reality.  She addresses the real cultural crisis, which is multi-faceted, spiritual, psychological, ecological, social, politic and economic.  Anyone wishing to understand the patterns of Western cultural history and the potentials of its future development must read this book.",1416960000,3,713,5.387387387387387
