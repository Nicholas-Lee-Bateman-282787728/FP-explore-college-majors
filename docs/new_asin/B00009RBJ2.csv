7992784,1,B00009RBJ2,"This one of the worst guitar style DVD's Have have ever bought.
If you want to watch a thresher hack-up some floyd, then this is for you.
If you want a really good DVD by the series from Lick Library, Jamie Humphries will get you through those tough string bends.",1235001600,2,263,4.28
7992785,3,B00009RBJ2,"Now I'm a guitarist, and I have not seen his other films on ""How to Play in the Style of"" some other artist, but be warned.  This video gives you 50 riffs of pink floyds material, mostly from Dark Side and up.  All the riffs are only a few measures in length, some a little longer, and some are solos but only small portions of solos, not the whole thing.  If you don't have any guitar books on Pink Floyd and want to just know a few of the big riffs, like Money, buy it, it's worth a buy.  Also, if you go to the site from which the dvd was made, you can actually print out the guitar tablature to read off of when you play along with them instead of straining your eyes to read the tab on your dvd screen, which is very hard sometimes.

The problem is, his riffs and tabs are not always correct, considering I do have the Official Hal Leonard Pink Floyd Tab Books, and from playing guitar a few years, know that some of his stuff is close, but not exact to the real way of playing it (such as guitar bends that he does not include that David Gilmour uses, the guitarist of Pink Floyd).  So like I said, it's something, but not even close to perfect in any way shape or form.

One last note is do not expect to see Pink Floyd at all in this film, this is specifically Curt Mitchell teaching you riffs, that's it!",1135123200,14,1313,4.065891472868217
7992786,2,B00009RBJ2,"Much of my thoughts are summed up by others. But maybe we should be fair. This tape does appear to be on the low end of the production scale and Curt doesn't really teach anything. Basiclly this tape is  showing you the notes and you can see how he plays them.

If your looking to learn some cool pink floyd stuff, you can get some of the cool riffs on this tape. This tape isn't about teaching you to be a David Gilmore or anything other than to learn some good licks. If you want theory, stay away. If you want to learn song structure, stay away. If your a pink floyd nut, stay away. But if you like floyd and just want to pick up a few chops and not neccesarily play the entire floyd catalog from begining to end (or even a complete song for that matter), then this tape might be worth while.

As for the acuracy? I am not that good on guitar so I can't comment. But I have found over the years that players tend not to play what was recorded on the record for may reasons, so I wouldn't fret too much about it. It sounds like what Floyd does (except for his sound on his equipement is NOT like floyds). It is close enough unless your a purest, which ironically much of Floyd's work seems to be. Hmmm....",1132531200,,1207,4.1059322033898304
7992787,1,B00009RBJ2,"I bought this movie for $5 from cd warehouse. It came without the tabulature (if you can call it that) yet I still found it as equally worthless as the Beatles Curt Mitchell tape I have WITH the tabulature. Hes not fooling anyone with his lavish box with no picture of the band and EXTREME CLOSEUPS in bold print. This basement tape was most likely made for under $100. As you know he refers to the songs as ""Riff 1, 2"" ect. Its as if he is avoiding the songs name and playing just a few measures to avoid copyright laws. I have many favorite parts such as ""Its a late 60s stratocastor, actually I don't know what year it is?"" he says with that pateneted Curt Mitchell Dumb stare. He is poorly groomed and to be honest quite pathetic.  Yet again my high hopes were dashed by the best 3 second riff player ever, CURT MITCHELL",1079395200,,824,4.248407643312102
7992788,1,B00009RBJ2,"Quite a sorry display, I thought...  I was so looking forward to learning some of Dave's best riffs..  the video looks like it was made in someone's basement..  very disappointing for any true Pink Floyd fan",961027200,16,207,4.694444444444445
