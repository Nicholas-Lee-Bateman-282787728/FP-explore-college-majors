4571615,5,B00553K9DU,"Skateland was a very gratifying movie to watch.  Just out of high school, the guy (Ritchie) and girl (Michelle) were facing their first summer of young adulthood, while reluctantly letting go of their adolescence.  There was certainly enough summer parties and adventures to keep things popping.  The ending was amazing, as Michelle gently guided Richie's future - even though she was emotionally distraught due to a family tragedy.

4571618,4,B00553K9DU,"This movie really resonates with me for some reason.  The characters have depth and there are a few twists here and there.  It nails the year 1983 in so many ways--not just musically.  The protagonist could move on with his life/career, but so many things are keeping him from advancing.  His way of living is like a trap from which he could escape but, at the same time, this life has its comforts.",1335398400,,399,4.424657534246576

Well, you may want to check out ""Skateland"", the latest film from director Anthony Burns  (""Pandemic""),  a coming-of-age film set in 1983 featuring hit songs from that year, people hanging out at the local roller rink and a group of young adults partying all night long!

The film is co-written by Burns, Brandon Freeman and actor Heath Freeman (""Bones""), who also stars in the film.

The low-budget indie film also stars Shiloh Fernandez (""Red Riding Hood"", ""Interstate"", ""Deadgirl""), Ashley Greene (""Twilight"" films), Bret Cullen (""Ghost Rider"", ""Apollo 13', ""Monte Carlo""), Haley Ramm (""X-Men: The Last Stand"", ""Into the Wild"", ""Flightplan""), Taylor Handley (""Battle Los Angeles"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"") and Melinda McGraw (""The Dark Knight"", ""Men of a Certain Age"").

VIDEO:

""Skateland"" is a low-budget film but the film looks absolutely great on Blu-ray.  The film was shot on 35 mm and there is good amount of grain, but also detail.  You can see the skin detail of the character's very well, the lighting is nicely done and black levels are nice and deep. I detected no DNR, edge enhancement or banding.

So, for the most part, the clarity and detail look very good and also features quite a bit of color as well.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Skateland"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround and while there is good ambiance coming from the surround channel, I have to say that the audio is what I loved about the film.

For one, a lot of '80s hits are featured throughout the film and second, unlike a few of the films based on the '80s that have come out this year, at least they got the era right.

From Def Leppard's ""Rock of Ages"", Modern English's ""I Melt With You"", Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" to name a few, there is a good amount of music throughout this film and the music does play over the surround channels quite a bit.

There are some action-based scenes but for the most part, this is a dialogue and music-driven lossless soundtrack. Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Skateland comes with the following special feature:

  Deleted Scenes - (34:06) Featuring ten deleted scenes.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Skateland"" is a low budget indie film that doesn't seem like it and to give the film some credit, I did enjoy it over a film such as ""Take Me Home Tonight"" (another film based in the '80s) mainly because they got the music and the look right for 1983. The film really has to give credit to their costume design by Kari Perkins and also Bart Brown of set decoration for capturing the look and feel of the '80s.

It's something I'm very critical about when I see a film that takes place in the '80s and most importantly, for a low budget film, they sure did manage to get a lot of '80s hit songs in this film.  So, needless to say, I was quite surprised by the musical soundtrack. With that being said, ""Skateland"" is a film that is a straightforward coming-of-age film.

While the film does have its fun and entertaining moments, the screenplay felt that it jumped ahead of itself and not thoroughly building upon character development and also awkward direction.

For example, in one scene, Ritchie (Shiloh Fernandez) and Michelle (Ashley Greene) are discussing their future together.  Instead of showcasing the faces of each character, they leave the camera focused on the character of Michelle for a good amount of time and didn't even show Ritchie's face at all during the conversation.

That was a bit odd but it made me wonder if the scene was re-shot, with someone standing in for Fernandez who may have contributed his voice during post-production. Another scene that felt odd is once the tragedy occurs, we see Ritchie becoming a bit emotional but then all of sudden, when he gets home...he seems alright. It was not the type of emotion you would expect from a guy who was involved in a tragic accident.

And just to add one more awkward scene to discuss, there is a scene when Ritchie is dropped of at home by his mother.  After he talks to his mother, he grabs her head and goes for a kiss and leaves.  You don't see that many intimate mother and son kisses on screen like that...and I found that scene a bit awkward.

Then there are scenes that just didn't make since.  I guess to show more of that '80s nostalgia or for comedy purposes, you have these two characters that show up in the party, doing moonwalks and talking nonsense.  These characters really  have nothing to contribute to the overall storyline and seemed to be thrown into the film for nostalgia sake.

Sure, I may have over-thought these scenes a bit too much but these few scenes stick out and made me question the screenplay.  Sure, there are some things featured in the film were unnecessary and trimmed out scenes (which can be seen on the deleted scenes) that would have added some depth to the characters but there were plenty of scenes that should have been trimmed out.

Still, despite the film's flaws, there are positives.  Ashley Greene definitely showed her emotional side as an actress and definitely shows that she can do more than what she had done on the ""Twilight"" films and once again, I bring up the music because the film has has an awesome musical soundtrack.

Not sure how much the film was budgeted for but for a low budget indie-film, they sure were able to get a lot in terms of casting and music.  So, that was a plus!

And I did enjoy it much more than other recent films that take place in the '80s. Overall, ""Skateland"" was an OK coming-of-age films which has its fair share of flaws but is one of the better modern films that is set in the '80s that manages to capture the overall look and the music is just right!

If you are nostalgic for the '80s, definitely give ""Skateland"" a try!",1323993600,,5814,4.63671875
4571620,3,B00553K9DU,"This movie is slow going and the language is a bit rough for my liking. I was thinking it shows ""what not to do"" for older teenagers.  But in the end there was a small morale which redeemed it in my eyes.  I would rate it Average.",1322179200,,230,3.872340425531915
4571621,1,B00553K9DU,"My title says it all. This is one of the worst movies I've ever made the mistake of buying. It makes no sense; the acting is terrible, and their is no plot. Complete waste of time! I bought the movie because Ashley Greene (Twight) who plays an excellent actress (as a vampire in that movie) I thought may be good in this movie. NOT! I really can't, for all sakes and purposes call this a movie! Maybe an exercise in what an actor, director and writers should NOT do.",1320883200,,466,4.247191011235955
4571622,5,B00553K9DU,"first there was american graffiti, then there was dazed and confused.  i always wondered ""why not the 80s, i mean i grew up in the 80s and it was great, they should recreate it <and not in a slapstick comedy but a way that is real>, then i was standing at the redbox and there it was Skateland.
the only thing that didn't make much sense to me is a couple of time line things. this apears to be set in the 80s and its set around the death of the roller rink (which i remember happening for the most part <for the most part because my city still has them but they got run down and most of them shut down) in about 92 but they were really booming in the mid eighties, and in Skateland people are leaving the rinks and going to the discos. discos were big in the 70s.  so skateland seems to have its timeline quite a bit screwed up.
i loved the ""sonic"" reference because so often they use mom and pop burger drive ins like how dazed and confused had top knotch.  where not everyone relates to texas drive ins, i know around here we had sonic and bumpers (still do).
skateland was like opeing a time capsule.  sure they had better haircuts though they did sport those god aweful mustaches.
all in all this is a movie i will definatly wear out in my dvd player.",1317168000,7,1256,4.135245901639344

The clothes, music true to the times. Spent many a Friday, Saturday night @ the obligatory local roller rink, some of the best days of my life. So if you're big on Nostalgia and this film reasonates personally and you want to take a walk down memory lane, this film definitely worth checking out.

In the early 1980s, in small-town Texas, dramatic events force a 19-year-old skating rink manager to look at his life in a very new way.

The movie stars Shiloh Fernandez and Ashley Green (TWILIGHT) in breakout roles. If you dig 80's teen movies, this is a flick for you.",1435881600,,486,4.511363636363637
