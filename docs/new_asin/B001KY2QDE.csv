8316459,4,B001KY2QDE,"I remember watching this short-lived series when it ran in syndication here in the states. In ""Return of the Saint"" (The complete series: 1978 - 1979), Ian Ogilvy brought his own sophisticated style (just like Roger Moore), in this slight update to the Saint/Simon Templar canon. I've always liked Ian Ogilvy's subtle yet very convincing acting style (i.e. - see him in the 1970 version of ""Wuthering Heights""), but due to his lack of international exposure, he was superseded by his fellow British actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Michael Caine, Alan Bates, Timothy Dalton etc., etc. I was sure he was going to be the next ""Bond"", once Roger Moore outgrew the role, but alas, that was never to be! Anyway, this underrated series is worth taking a peek at for many reasons: plenty of European locales, Euro-babes by the score, with lots of minor/underappreciated British and European stars (from television and film); including some American guest-stars too. Twenty-four episodes in all, done with all the escapism/suspense of reality that was to be expected from this genre, but with that unique look and perspective that I believe, could only have been achieved in the decade of the 70's.

The DVD picture and sound quality by Granada Ventures is very good. PAL format, English (no subtitles), special features, NR 1200 mins. (BTW: I bought this very same 7 disc set from Amazon.uk for just under $30.00 dollars.)

8316460,5,B001KY2QDE,"I actually love the return of the saint, story lines & the action are real good. I also love the way he wore denims & different jackets liked the fashion trends for its time honestly half to say bought the umbrella version that was released in 2004 DVD set noticed more people are buying the network version is it because there are more features or difference in the sound? I cant wait for a region 1 release by acorn media or someone this is a super cool version of the saint.",1426464000,2,477,4.252747252747253
8316461,5,B001KY2QDE,"When this neglected series made it's debut in 1978, it was not treated kindly by either press or public. Which was a great shame, because I think the makers did a wonderful job of updating Leslie Charteris' character for the seventies, without losing the essence of the original. Also, Ian Ogilvy's interpretation of Simon Templar was far closer to the author than Roger Moore's. This aspect was totally lost on those critics and viewers whose only experience of The Saint was the Moore series and who had clearly never read any of the Charteris canon. Certain aspects of the original character were still toned down of course - this Saint never commited cold blooded murder of the bad guys and didn't carry knives - but Ogilvy came across convincingly as both a suave charmer and also as a very dangerous man to oppose. It did take a while to get used to seeing The Saint in denims instead of impeccably tailored suits, but this was part and parcel of updating the character for the contemporary era - and when he did wear suits, he looked fine.

The scripts were pretty decent, and they sometimes touched on darker, more adult themes than the Roger Moore series, just as the original Charteris stories had. Signal Stop, for instance, had rapists who photographed their crimes and The Arrangement had a villainess who was disturbingly psychotic. This was all handled tastefully for family audiences, of course, but it was harder edged than the earlier series had been.

If the series had a major fault, it was the preponderance of stories set in Italy at the expense of other countries, given that The Saint was meant to be a globe trotting adventurer. This was because it was a co-production with the Italian TV company RAI who insisted on Italian settings as part of the production deal. Suprisingly, not one single episode was set in the USA, the most crucial market for any TV series then and now. Another problem was the tiresome crackdown on TV violence at the time, which further diluted the series' impact and resulted in some rather silly looking fight scenes.

Those glitches aside, Return Of The Saint was a very well made updating of a popular character, professionally produced by all concerned and did not deserve the indifference shown to it.",1391126400,10,2258,4.7846153846153845
8316462,4,B001KY2QDE,"It was a great show!  It had suspense, romance, humor, and beautiful scenery.  I think it was better than the original ""Saint"" series.  It's too bad there was only one season.",1371772800,5,175,4.580645161290323
