8169445,1,B00082ZQRC,"I bought this DVD expecting at least SOME production value and some entertainment value.

I wasted my money - this is an amateur production which leaves a lot to be desired! I certainly won't bother with future Glitter Award productions!

NOT recommended unless you have money to burn and just want to fill your shelf with DVDs!",1151193600,2,328,4.7368421052631575
