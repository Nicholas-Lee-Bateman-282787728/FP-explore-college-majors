8072204,5,B000A1ILAK,"I love this movie and it made me wish that all it took to have children. When I was little I thought all it took to have kids is to get married, sleeping in the same bed together (NMS Not Mention Sex) & kissing someone you love.
Years later I wish that part was still true for my sister and Brother in-law sake.",1409788800,,311,3.9523809523809526
8072205,5,B000A1ILAK,Although this is a VHS it was in great shape and the movie was as interesting as  I remembered.  Thanks!,1367452800,,104,4.15
8072206,4,B000A1ILAK,"I am NOT going to hack this by saying, it's boy/girl break-up, alien impregnates girl etc...I liked it.  Why?  There is some humor in it--granted the theme is not for kiddies--especially where she ends up impregnated from that hotter than Haedes kissing scene (Does 9 1/2 weeks ring a bell here?) and makes the comment, ""IF he is that good in bed, I wouldn't be able to walk the next day.""  Remember the orgasm scene from ""Sleepless in Seattle""?  This SORT of brought that to mind and I did laugh.  Besides, Ben Cross was hot in it! Yeah, you read it right!  Now if you want a movie you can hack up to your heart's content, I suggest Haunted Symphony (aka Bloodsong) simply because Mystery Science Theater had a field day with that!  Again, don't let the kiddies watch either movie.  But you ladies who are still into Ben Cross will love this! I didn't know who he was until 2009, but I do love a lot of the work he has done...Yes, at times a movie suffers due to budget, bad writing and miscasting (as this one does some) but Ben Cross can make some of the worst scripts shine. He has a knack for it.",1295222400,,1101,4.285024154589372
8072207,4,B000A1ILAK,"this movie is about 2 aliens from another planet, one good and the other bad, landing on earth. The good alien kidnaps a girl and impregnates her. It has some good action. I love this movie. It's an older movie, but if you like sc-fi, it's worth watching!!!  Babs",1256515200,15,263,4.36734693877551
8072208,3,B000A1ILAK,"This was a science-fiction story that was boy and girl break up, alien finds girl, girl saves alien race and boy gets back girl.

It was a very nice story with unexpected twists and turns. It was very well written, recognizable leads, and nice special effects. At a few places it actually made me cry. I liked it!",1209254400,19,313,4.396551724137931
