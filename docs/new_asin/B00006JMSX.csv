7970571,5,B00006JMSX,"This is a great collection and is Chevy Chase's best films.  (Well, and Vacation.)  My favorite out of the three would have to be Spies Like Us.  It's so funny when they go into the tent with a bunch of docter's and they pretend to be docter's and they greet each other like this ""Doctor, doctor, doctor, nice to meet you doctor, doctor, docter, docter, nice to meet you, doctor, and doctor.  Funny farms special features are horrible.  All we get on the menu is Play, Scene Selction, and Set Up.  Come on warner, for this classic, aleast add a trailer and a commentary.  But Spies Like Us is WORSE.  How, all it has on the main menu is Play and Scene Selection.  Not even a set up, and yet it's fullscreen.  Shame on you warner.  Caddyshack's features are ok.  Good documentary but should have had a commentary.  Let's say, (even with the lack of features on two of the films) that this set is well worth your money.
Caddyshack- This is a great film.  Bill Murray and Chevy Chase are hilarious in this film.  Althou it is a little crude, and is not for your kids, it will still have you rolling with laughter.  The golpher is the best part of this movie.  He is so funny.  9/10
Rated R for language, sexual content, mild violence, crude humor, and nudity.
Funny Farm- This is a pretty funny film and the box doen't lie.  This is some of Chevy's best work.  It is a movie for the whole family to enjoy on a friday night.  One of my favorite parts is when the ducks fly away and Chevy's says ""Bye fellas"". Then you hear a gun shot and the birds come flying back and he says ""Hi fellas.""  8/10
Rated PG for some mild language, crude humor and some violence.
Spies Like Us- Now this movie is the real treat in this set.  It had me laughing my @$$ off all the way through and you will too.  Dan Akroyd and Chevy Chase are great together.  Enough said.  ""I was gonna do your family a favor and install the the disney channel for free, but forget it.""  10/10
Rated PG for launguage and some crude humor.
So go on and get this pack.  You won't regret it.",1078617600,,2047,4.219638242894057
