8173303,2,B000MX7V0C,"If you are curious as to what John's been up to in the afterlife take a look at this DVD.  The thing about these types of progams is that you must first surrender some skepticism to even try to believe what's being presented.  I lean to the notion of an afterlife, who wouldn't want to live on?  And connecting with someone who's moved on...well.  For the price, give it a go and watch it on a rainy night if you want to have a haunting feeling as you watch it.  At the very least it's entertaining and curious.  I felt the fella who was channeling music from John was the most sincere and wouldn't it be more accurate to say he's inspired by John's music??  At worst, it's a poor attempt to get this Beatle fan to believe that the sensitives in this show got the ""real"" John Lennon.  The message of ""peace""  is so dead (pun intended) common, how could they assert it was John Lennon?  Maybe it was just a nice Englishman who knows John on the other side...; )",1223596800,,960,4.225274725274725
