3771441,3,B001QWQJD8,"I personally think Inuyasha is very strange, but my daughter, who has autism, loves the series and has to have every new season set that is released!  SHE loves it!!!",1244419200,,166,4.533333333333333
3771442,3,B001QWQJD8,"The anime version of Inuyasha is incomplete. The final episode of Season 7 leaves the anime hanging. The original manga (Japanese Version) contained the death of Naraku as well as Kanna and Kagura. In addition, character storylines were wrapped up. The producers of Inuyasha should've translated the Japanese manga into the anime and thus making it complete. If you want to know exactly what happened after the ""Series Finale"" you will have to wait a while before the english version of the manga is published. If you know Japanese, feel free to read that version since it is already completed.",1242259200,,594,4.95
3771443,5,B001QWQJD8,"I was worried about buying this, because at first it didn't say it had English dub, but it's the legit limited edition 7th season! It comes with episodes 147-160 of Season Six and episodes 161-167 of Season Seven... so this is the the final season, and if you have all the others, this will complete your set.

It comes with Special Footage - The Finale with the Japanese Cast/Questions for the English Language Voice Actors. Stereo. Bilingual (Japanese & English). English Subtitles, Textless Opening & Ending, and 21 episodes. This limited edition comes with a rare Inuyasha figure from the final episodes!
*SPOILER*
He's all demony, with the face markings, and it comes with Adamant Barrage Tetsusaiga which is all shiny and beautiful. It's really awesome and rare.
*END SPOILER*

This box set is way more shiny than the others, you can actually see yourself in the outside casing of the dvds. =3 It's the best one yet, in my opinion, and well worth the money since you get the great figure too! I love Inuyasha and have been collecting the seasons for like *counts* at least 6 years! I'm so glad I've finally got the last one and don't have to wait and wait and wait for the next season! I recommend this to any Inuyasha fan. I'm going to list the episodes next for anyone who's wondering and that's all for this review. Hope I help some people who are worried that since this looks different and doesn't say LIMITED EDITION in big letters in the title that it might not be legit, but I promise you it is. Says VIZ and everything. ;) My only regret is that the Inuyasha series stopped way before the end of the manga, but that has nothing to do with this boxset, since the anime series has only 167 episodes.

3771444,5,B001QWQJD8,"Having just finished watching the Season 7 set, and having been involved in a discussion at this site regarding some technical aspects of the package, let me say this up front:

1.  The English language option is available and it works.
2.  Contrary to some earlier misinformation at Viz Media's website, episodes 147-167 are all present and accounted for.
3.  Picture and sound are superb.
4.  The bonus material including interviews with the Japanese and English voice actors is a must-see.

While I'm not a fan of Anime in general, I'm a huge fan of this series.  The Season 7 set gives the Band of Seven storyline a run for its money for storytelling and character evolution (strong points of the entire series), and in terms of writing, pacing, and production values possibly surpasses it.  It is clear to me that everyone who put so much loving and painstaking detail into the production of ""Inuyasha"" went out at the top of their respective games.  And judging by the comments of both the Japanese and Canadian voice actors regarding fan response and the enjoyment they got out of working on the series, there's good reason to expect that the rest of the manga will eventually be rendered in anime.  Here's one fan who's hoping to see that day when it comes.",1241308800,22,1265,4.709090909090909
3771445,1,B001QWQJD8,"I find it really hard to swallow the price, 13 episodes for the same price as 26, especially with only 7!!!episode's to go in this series..

3771446,5,B001QWQJD8,Liek Jonathan said many of us faitful anime lovers of inuyasha was very hurt when Inuyasha just stopped. But finally the long awaited ending. It was a great idea they stopped while they were ahead and who can really say that there are aot of anime series out there that are faithful to the manga. I have been waiting since 2005 for the last episodes to come out and wile doing so I read the manga. =) I will also be getting this season as well because I love this series with a passion.,1240185600,3,486,4.180851063829787
3771447,5,B001QWQJD8,"Yes, this anime was over-hyped. Yes, the fanboyism was tough to stomach. Yes, it aired on adult swim. Inuyasha's popularity was tremendous...so tremendous, in fact, that there was bound to be a backlash in the otaku community. A considerably large reactionary anti-Inuyasha group arose within the community of anime fans which claimed that Inuyasha suffered from lame writing and bad animation. Well, guess what? It does...at times, anyway.
That said, Inuyasha deserves its place on anime's top shelf. Why? Several reasons...first and foremost is the artistic vision of Rumiko Takahashi, the author of the original manga. Her vision, which the creators of the anime reproduced quite faithfully, paints a marvelous fantasy set in the feudal era of Japan. Blending Japanese mythology with images of both Buddhism and Shinto, Takahashi's vision is unparalleled in anime. This combined with her tight plotting, clever storyline and composer Kaoru Wada's first rate soundtrack make Inuyasha a true triumph in not only anime but in film altogether.
Now for the negative...Inuyasha did suffer from logistical problems during its production. The creators of the anime wanted to reproduce Takahashi's manga faithfully and did just that--that is, until the anime caught up to the manga storyline. Then, the anime creators were forced to create ""filler"" episodes that had little impact on the central stories or characters until enough new manga material was released. This does grow tiresome but it shouldn't take anything away from any of Inuyasha's many marvelous episodes. Another problem is the anime's ending, or lack thereof. The fact is, the anime caught up to the manga once again and the creators decided that, rather than run the anime into the ground with another season of filler, they should pull the plug. Although this left many fans with a bitter taste in their mouths and pleased the haters, this actually was the right thing to do. The anime had been very faithful to the manga up until this point and the creators did not want to stray from that path, so they chose the path of artistic integrity and I, for one, am glad they did. This enabled the Inuyasha anime to end while it was still popular and also enabled it to retain its artistic sincerity. I have chosen to read the remaining manga (Inuyasha ran for a whopping 56 volumes!) to experience the rest of the story as Takahashi intended.
In summation, don't believe the haters...Inuyasha really is a great anime and even though it has its flaws, if you really give it a chance, there is no reason why you couldn't enjoy it. I know that I will buy this seventh season when it is released--I purchased the first six, after all. ;)",1236470400,69,2693,4.9733924611973395

3771449,5,B001QWQJD8,"What can I say, it's INU YASHA! This has become my favorite Japanese cartoon of all time. The storyline is just enough supernatural and childish matters to make it very entertaining. My daughter still loves it.",1403654400,,210,4.861111111111111
3771450,5,B001QWQJD8,"My favorite Medieval Japanese fairy tale! Grown ups and older children will probably like it. It has some anime violence,  I would say a PG13, advisory. A really good storyline, nothing rated R or X, that would unpleasantly surprise you, nor overly graphic in its battle scenes against a clearly defined evil bad guy and his monsters. Safe to show to your family. Good character development and a decent plot. And it has a very good musical score to go with it. The main characters behave compassionately, and strive for becoming better and of course, in stopping the villan from hurting more people. It has a definite end where they accomplish their set out goal, (instead of endlessly chasing it), and do their best to do right by each other along their journey. The characters have some misadventures, but nothing depicting sex scenes or disrespecting others or supporting said behavior that encourages others to do so. I would definitely continue to buy more Inu Yasha.",1397088000,,973,4.8969696969696965

At times, I find Inuyasha to be really obvious and redundant. It's supposed to be an anime for adults, but the way the characters repeat themselves and state the obvious, I think this show would be okay for kids.

3771472,5,B001QWQJD8,I now have all 8 seasons and I love them they are interesting and done very well. Before I discovered this show on Adult swim I had no idea it existed but once I did I couldn't get enough the story sucks you in.  I never cared for anime I always felt the artistry and writing was way to lame and childish but this anime actually is very good and at least the characters don't look like they all stuck their heads in an electric socket and their eyes aren't all to big for their heads ect. I tried to watch Naruto once and once was enough I assure you the story was silly and I didn't understand any of the motivations.  I like Bleach to but it can be hard to follow at times with way to many variations on the characters I finally can understand it now that I saw the first season up until then it was to confusing Inuyasha however I saw the first time was like episode 80 or something and I could follow it after two shows and figure what was going on so Inuyasha is my favorite and I even let my young nephew watch it he loves it I won't let him watch Bleach however he may be 9 but even I'm not stupid enough to let him watch a show so totally violent and confusing that I have to explain it all to him I just explained a few things about Inuyasha and he got it it's mainly about the good guys and the bad guys and the ones your never sure about kind of like ha ha real life.,1263427200,,1378,3.935483870967742
3771473,5,B001QWQJD8,"I'm not a kid.  I'm well-seasoned and well-read, so I think I can speak from a more adult point of view.

This series rocks!  Some otaku (generally a pejorative term) have panned the series based on what is no doubt a superficial assessment.  I have read the manga, seen all the episodes (to date) and seen all four of the movies.  I also have all the Japanese versions of the manga, all the art books, and a little known book on the psychology of InuYasha.  I can say, without fear of contradiction, that this is a WONDERFULLY written series that kids would certainly enjoy.  I think the monsters may be a bit much for the 6 and younger set, but that may well be my only caution.  Those who denegrate it, obviously weren't really paying attention to the story.  And it sure does have one.

The story of InuYasha is a complicated tale that includes trial and tragedy, betrayal, and lost love.  It is even on some levels, a deeply moving story that features a detailed history, complex and interwoven plot, and engaging and charismatic characters.

There are areas in both the manga and the anime where the story lags somewhat, but in my estimated opinion, they are not that much of a problem.  There is plenty of action, humor, and imagery to keep a kid thoroughly enthralled.  Best of all, just when I think I've grown weary of it; the moment I catch a few old episodes, I fall in love with it all over again.

To the curmudgeons of anime, I'd say move along to your giant robots.  This one is for those of us who enjoy a good fantasy romp with characters that can become like friends.",1262649600,7,1586,4.417241379310345
3771474,5,B001QWQJD8,"For fans of the show, and for those who read the manga this box set is the completion of a major piece of literary work, as the book contains over 600 chapters, and over 50 volumes. I would love to see the anime finish up but who knows what will happen. I liked the interviews with both the Japanese voice actors, and the English ones as well.",1259452800,2,343,4.134328358208955
3771475,5,B001QWQJD8,"If you're reading a review for the 7th season of Inuyasha, you're most likely a committed fan and don't need much convincing as to whether or not you'll want to own this set.

And to clear up any doubts or confusion, there is most definitely an 8th season.  Episodes have already aired in Japan.  Do a google search or visit websites like Viz's, and see for yourself.

As far as this season is concerned the price tag isn't justified, but I still enjoyed the episodes immensely.  The storyline moves the characters closer and closer to a final confrontation with Naraku, but the ending makes it absolutely clear that this will not be the end of the anime.  Not a single aspect of the plot is wrapped up.  And, as the announcement of Inuyasha the Final Act confirmed for me, nobody in their right mind possessing even the smallest shred of common sense would have allowed the anime series to simply end with episode 167 and the 4th movie.  But, there are still many things to appreciate about these episodes.  The storyline and plot progress in the same manner as fans have come to expect.  And what I found to be particularly enjoyable were the episodes dedicated to individual subplots such as the two episodes dedicated to a closer look at how Inuyasha and Kikyo met, the episode featuring flashbacks of Sango and Kohaku's past, the episode where Shippo unleashes his arsenal of fox-demon magic with great and humorous success against his opponents, or the episode where Kagome's friends finally meet Inuyasha.  Some people tend to label these as ""filler"" episodes.  But I've always found that regardless of whether or not certain episodes were drawn from the Mangas, they've always managed to give the viewer a more in-depth, and often humorous, look at the characters and who they are.  These episodes are no exception and help make the viewing experience entirely worthwhile.

Hopefully, this will help any undecided buyers.  This isn't the end of the anime.  And this is most definitely a worthy addition to the Inuyasha saga.  I'm eagerly looking forward to the 8th season.",1255737600,3,2080,4.814084507042254
3771476,3,B001QWQJD8,"The Inuyasha Seventh Season Box Set includes four DVDs, which contain twenty-one of the episodes from the final season of the anime. The first disc contains six episodes, the second and third discs contain five episodes, and the fourth disc contains five episodes and the special features.

Disc four contains four special features.  The first feature is a ""Textless Opening,"" which is essentially the opening that appears at the beginning of each episode, but this version doesn't have the text that covers the pictures.  The second feature is ""Textless Ending.""  However, instead of having a textless version of the ending that appears on this box set, it is a textless verion of an ending that appeared on one of the previous DVD box sets.

The next special feature is labeled as ""The Finale With the Japanese Cast.""  This feature runs for about eight minutes.  It includes interviews with the Japanese voice actors for Inuyasha, Shippo, Sango, Miroku, Kagome, and Sesshomaru.  There is also some footage of the cast recording dialogue for the final episode.

The last special feature on the disc is labeled as, ""Questions for the English Language Voice Actors.""  This feature runs for about eighteen minutes, and it was recorded at the wrap party for the English dub actors.  Unfortunately, with the feature being recorded at the wrap party, there's a lot of ambient noise in the background, which can make it hard to hear some of the voice actors when they're talking.  The English dub actors for Inuyasha, Kagome, Shippo, Miroku, Sango, and Koga are interviewed for this feature.

If you're a fan of Inuyasha and want to have all of the episodes on DVD, then you need to acquire this set.  Like the other Inuyasha box sets, this one retails for around $90.  I appreciate the fact that Viz Media included the interviews with the Japanese and English voice actors.  However, I wish the audio quality had been better on the interviews with the English dub actors.  Even with that flaw, though, this set really needs to be acquired by an Inuyasha fan in order to complete their DVD collection.",1252972800,4,2095,4.872881355932203
