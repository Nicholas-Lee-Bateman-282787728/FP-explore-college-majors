8273942,1,B000P2A5DU,"When I see the words ""Wide Screen"" I assume there is a movie involved.  Wouldn't you?  But  nooooooo.  This is NOT a movie.  While you listen to a mediocre set of recorded interviews by Nick Pope and others the screen is filled with a continually changing montage of pictures of planets and other worldly sites.  If you have a hard time falling asleep this is for you.  Otherwise,  run.  As fast as you can.  RUN",1389139200,,412,4.373333333333333
8273943,5,B000P2A5DU,"Where do UFO's come from and what do they want? How many different groups are coming here and are there agendas different? Where can you go to for help and why you?
Are UFO's using Black Holes to travel the vast distances of space? Have they harnessed 0
Point Energy as an power source?
Animated with an advanced computer graphics software to create our
still images of UFO's, exotic worlds and outer space animations. Visually stunning CG images & animations. Compelling soundtrack.
Perhaps by expanding our imagination the truth won't seem so strange.",1223164800,,553,4.956989247311828
8273944,1,B000P2A5DU,"Ok, it was only $1.99 so I figured how bad can it be?  We'll, pretty bad it turns out.  They have literally recorded interviews taken over the phone by various folks and then superimposed them on slightly changing computer generated backgrounds. The same graphic of a 'ufo' in front of mountains sits for minutes, then it starts snowing, then it starts raining and the sky gets dark.  Think the most uninteresting computer screen saver and you have pegged the visual track.  For the audio track then think late night AM talk radio.  A recipe for a nap for sure, but skip the video and just take a nap.",1200268800,,601,4.527777777777778
8273945,3,B000P2A5DU,"Caution! This is good material but there is no live footage. The DVD is a ""slide show"" of unrelated, although interesting, images of artwork depicting alien landscapes, space, UFOs etc while narrators speak in the background.",1193270400,,225,5.277777777777778
