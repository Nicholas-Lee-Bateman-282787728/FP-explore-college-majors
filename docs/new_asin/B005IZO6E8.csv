8475307,5,B005IZO6E8,"Charlie Chan in Dark Alibi, 1946 film

Men work in the dark with a blowtorch. There is an explosion! Next a shot. At the Foss Family Hotel a young woman asks if she received a letter. Her father arrives, the police arrest him for murder and robbery! Harley is convicted and sentenced to die. His daughter June wants help from a private detective. Charlie Chan will help her. Chan questions the owner of the Foss Hotel, then the other residents. Some were in the cities where banks were robbed. The next day as Chan and his assistants drive to the prison someone shoots at them! Chan goes to see Harley. Birmingham Brown talks to his brother Ben (for comedy). Harley says he was never in that bank and doesnt know how his fingerprints got there. Birmingham and Tommy Chan provide more comedy, and cause a disturbance. Charlie has an idea on forging fingerprints. He does research on other bank robberies and thinks of a connection.

Charlie goes to that theatrical warehouse with Tommy and Birmingham. The latter provides more comedy. Mr. Johnson is there, but at first pretends deafness. Miss Petrie arrives, but a truck hits and kills her! Fingerprint records are kept in the prison. An expert finds the fingerprint records were tampered with. One prisoner is missing! He attacks a guard and takes his tommy gun. Come and get me! Slade is dead when he fires a revolver. Back at the Foss Hotel Chan collects fingerprints from the people there. They show how fingerprints can be forged by photography and engraving. They go to that warehouse and look around. Then shots are fired! Tommy and Birmingham get into a truck and drive. Chan captures a man. Now he has the evidence to exonerate Harley from the murder conviction. But Chan says they must first catch the gang leader, and identifies him. There will be a happy ending for the good guys. There is another comic scene to end this movie.

This is more somber than other movies in the series. There is no travel to foreign locations. It tells about a technique that forges incontrovertible evidence. Prisons are no longer the repository for fingerprint records.",1486425600,,2113,4.752043596730245
