8208668,5,B000077VSW,"Well worth checking out if you are at all interested in what happened in Cambodia. Information about the elusive Pol Pot/Saloth Sar isn't easy to come by. This volume focuses more on the effects of the regime as opposed to the man himself. It's highly recommended though. David Chandler is involved in this project; no surprise that it's so worthwhile. The historical footage (which, by the way, is unbelieveable) is interspersed with modern footage of Cambodia. I cannot recommend this highly enough to those who are interested in Cambodia and who feel like digging a bit deeper than ""The Killing Fields"".",1081296000,,606,5.00990099009901
