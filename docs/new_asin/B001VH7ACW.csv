SPOILS is a delightfully gory revengesploitation film, where even death can't stop the Evil that flows through the halls of the house.

Three slothful friends,Nick, Amber and Rusty (J. Delarosa, Janna Biggs, Randall Mcmillan)  are looking for a fun and easy way to make some cash working at a haunted attraction being reopened in a small town by a mysterious woman named Elena (Jennifer Stone). But this town doesn't like outsiders. The Sheriff (Mark Stone ) will do whatever he can to keep both order in his town and to hide his blood-soaked past. An axe wielding, sadistic, blood thirsty clown, known as Spoils (Bart Butler) in a haunted house that no one can escape rounds out this tale of revenge...

SOMETHING IS WAITING FOR THEM!!!

I am not going to reveal any more about the plot in this review as to do so would risk spoiling SPOILS before you get to see it.

Abel Berry and Jennifer Stone, along with Bart Butler, the owner of  The Haunt House who is responsible for the special effects and set designer, demonstrate with their first film, that having a small budget is no excuse for making a bad film.  The actors in this film are all friends and all first time actors.  All of these first time actors delivered performances that sell their character and contribute to the beauty of this incredible low-budget gem.  The story works.  It is not predictable and the backstory weaved throughout is done beautifully.  The kills are good.  Abel and Bart worked together to create practical effects  that are believable.  A girl gets an axe to the back, a guy gets chainsawed,  and with a very small budget, a couple of dummies, and copious use of blood the kills worked very well.

In his first foray into independent horror cinema, Abel demonstrates that he truly as a talent for cinematography and directing.  There are so many really cool shots in this film.  There are lots of scenery shots throughout the haunted house.  Every scene is perfectly lit and backlit to provide proper atmosphere.  Jennifer Stone takes hours of film and demonstrates that she has the chops to edit.  Editing is as important as the cinematography as a bad editing job can seriously ruin the director's vision.  Jennifer did a masterful job.

Oh, lest I forget, the film even has a low-budget zombie scene film contained within.  Abel created the worst of bad indie zombie cinema for this scene.  It's a funnier than hell addition to a great horror film.  It's an excellent testament to Abel and Jennifer's creativity as writers.

This film proves, beyond doubt, that a great story can become an excellent film and if you have access to a pre-built set that serves the story, really cool props, a couple of hard-working perfectionists, and a cast and crew that does not allow ""it's my first film"" to ever serve as an excuse for bad performances that you can do it with a tiny little budget.",1238025600,5,3020,4.700952380952381
