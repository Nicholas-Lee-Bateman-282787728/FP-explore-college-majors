8591571,4,B000JKRIQU,"The selection of songs for this DVD is good, it would be excellent if they would have selected older songs from his beginning with Omar Geles and ""Los Diablitos"" that they did not.  The quality of some of the videos is not that good due to the transfer from VHS to DVD format. Besides that, I think it is a good DVD.",1205107200,,316,4.096774193548387
