3903871,2,B002C68WSW,"Ming is an illegal Chinese immigrant, living in New York City and working in a Chinese restaurant, delivering the take-out orders. He borrows money from a loan shark and struggles to keep up with the payments. The problem with this movie is that there isn't a story-an 87 minute film and probably 65 minutes are spent watching him peddle his bike back and forth, making his deliveries.",1263168000,4,385,4.7611940298507465

But it turned out to be a good move for me to see this because the film is well done and very interesting. The acting seems so real it's almost not even like a ""movie"" but a glimpse into someone's real life.  I dug it - it made me really think about that guy's life. Who knew?

Many parts had me on the edge of my seat.  It had me when he had to race against time to raise the money. I love race against time sequences in a movie.  I will think twice now when i tip the delivery man.

3903893,5,B002C68WSW,"This movie about a delivery man, shot in documentary style, was extremely difficult to watch. However, I think everyone should, as a first generation American, I of heard the plight of people labeled and branded as illegals who only came here when lied to about rags to riches stories that are actually few and far between in the US for someone without a proper education and/or working knowledge of the English language. And no, xenophobes, that doesn't give you the right over someone else to treat someone like dirt, sure deport them, but don't exploit them. There are everyday truths in this film of what someone has to endure in a single day working a generally thankless job. Modern day slavery does exist with immigrants treated as fresh meat and less than human, with no rights exercised, even if declared inalienable by our preamble in the Declaration of Independence, something almost all of us take for granted. There are really horrible people out there, if you can even call them people who treat others seen as below them, using foul language and actions to marginalize and exploit. If you do some of the things the robbers and ""customers"" do to this business and delivery guy over a few bucks-you are not human in my opinion. It's beyond me how people can treat each other this way - especially the younger generation who haven't been taught by parents to be humane. While it seems the older customers, however, usually showed a bit of compassion and humanity by trying to strike up conversation to the delivery guy-who simply made a mistake going to New York in this day and age without knowing English-told false lies and stories to be kept in line as another assembly worker with no real benefit and a bleak outlook-'4 years of this stuff', horrible at the least. I feel extremely lucky that I do not have to endure what this guy did, and it hurts that I know people that have to endure similar if not worse conditions. If he, the delivery man, Charles, doesn't get robbed, shot, and further marginalized into poverty. that look to literally argue for free drinks, try to bait and switch the business owner by ordering a cheap meal then trying to say they switched to something more ""expensive"" - all over one or two dollars of difference, no simple ""Thank you"", just riding in circles on a bike in rain and cold, all day, all night, every day, every night. Being talked down over, of all things, simple clothes, worn so someone could save to send to family a country away, then robbed at gun point by thugs, putting him at an even darker and hopeless setback. If you want to understand what another person may face at the other side of your convenience, you should watch this movie.",1424995200,,2701,4.652719665271967

Yet it is so sad that this is not only a movie but reality. I have even some Chinese come down to the south to achieve their American dream or make money. This movie also reminded me about immigration reform. I really we hope we have a sensible immigration reform soon.

P.S.
I think a practical solution would be for them to pay a fee in order to work in the US and have them also pay a catch-up fee for the benefits
(medicare...). I know that this sounds cold and cruel but lot of illegal immigrants are already paying lot of money to brokers and loan sharks. I think
making the process more sensible, transparent, and rational would be a great leap forward.

""revealing"" is too generous. I learned nothing about illegal immigration, how it happens, and how the traffickers operate. Nothing about the realities at home (China) and why they decide to leave.

At least a documentary would have allowed the subject to speak, or provide background. Why is this fiction? So we can see two kids conveniently rob the guy at the end? The reality isn't harsh enough to make a point, so we have to get a paper thin story?",1413849600,,496,4.744186046511628

I also never realized how hard being a delivery person's job is from a take out food perspective. The disregard and the different insults you encounter on any given day is an emotional beat down that is hard to surpass, which in the end makes your job that much harder to get up and go to and be pleasant at.

3903921,5,B002C68WSW,"""Take Out"" is a brilliant piece of low budget filmmaking. It covers a couple of days in the life  a Chinese illegal alien.

Ming Ding is one of those fixtures of the landscape, there but not there, the  guy on the bike, head down, weaving in and out of traffic, rain or shine, plastic bags of egg rolls and General Tso's Chicken dangling from the handlebars. He's the guy who hands the bags over to you, listens to you whine about not enough soy sauce or `they forgot the chopsticks', who makes change, takes his tip and never makes eye contact.  That's what we see. This is an almost cinema verite look at the parts we don't see.

The world Ming lives in isn't pretty. He and his coworkers are all indentured to the human traffickers who brought them here. Life is work, work is drudgery, pay is lousy. Ming once earned $90 in tips in a single day, his best day. Home is a rented bed in a tenement apartment with 20 or 30 other guys.  Still, in a year or two, he'll pay off his debt and start saving to bring over his wife and son. One of the other delivery men is saving to open his own business. They're here for a reason and they're willing to invest some real sweat equity into the program.

""Take Out"" is not all grim misery. Director Sean Baker always manages to bring a little low key humor to his work. The scenes in the restaurant have a kind of cockeyed New York charm. If you ever wanted to know what went on behind that counter where you placed your order (and who doesn't), this gives you a glimpse. The give and take between Elder Sister, who owns the restaurant, and her staff feels right. We make the rounds with Ming on one grueling day and night of non-stop deliveries and see ourselves through his eyes. We're the people behind the door, patronizing, cranky, rude. Everyone has a pose, and it's all wasted. All he needs from us, all he wants, is that tip. That's what he's pedalling the bike, why he's dodging trucks at ten o'clock on a miserble rainy night, running up and down two, three flights of stairs to get us our styrofoam containers while the goodies inside are still hot.

The camerawork is first rate, given that this appears to have been filmed in standard definition without much in the way of fancy lighting. Still, the bare bones look is just right; It captures completely the feeling of a working class New York neighborhood and the people who live there. This is not, however, a documentary. There is a plot. It involves Ming's problems with his loan sharks because of a missed payment. The shark sends two guys with a hammer to talk to Ming. They explain that his next payment has to be $800 or the debt will double. A little hammer to the ribs emphasizes the point. Ming goes to friends and family and begs and borrows $650, leaving him $150 short of the needed sum. He's left with one day of delivering take out to earn it.

One of the reviewers felt the film was slow.  If you're expecting car chases, chopsocky action and cheap thrills, maybe it is. Even the scene with the thugs who menace Ming isn't over the top. No ninja kicks or flying tiger leaps.  There is no gratuitous violence. These fellows are professionals and if they gave Ming a real beating, he might not be able to work the next day and they're more interested  getting paid than in breaking bones. Makes sense.  If you want acting that's low key and on point, emotions that feel genuine, people who seem real, and slice of life authenticity, you find it all here.

Baker, who did the shooting on ""Takeout"" has been compared to Martin Scorcese. The Village Voice says this is the most authentic neo-realist film-making since DeSica.  The comparisons are valid, but not necessary. Baker holds his own. Watch this and a similar film, ""Prince of Broadway.""  Both are standouts.  I hope we see more from this talented hyphenate. Five big stars for a gritty but not overwhelmingly grim NY story. Check out Take Out.",1382054400,20,3920,4.4525139664804465

3903925,4,B002C68WSW,"Sean Baker has made some really stunning micro budget films in recent years. Both his much lauded ""Tangerine"" and less known but equally excellent ""Starlet"" were wonderful comedy- dramas, artfully telling takes of those normally overlooked by mainstream cinema.

""Take Out"" is not quite as strong as those later works, but is still well worth seeing.

This verite style study of a Chinese food deliveryman's desperate rush to earn $800 to pay off the loan sharks that helped pay his way to the US has a nifty sense of almost documentary realism. The acting is very real and understated (by a mixed cast of actors and non-pros), and the tension level is high.

I didn't have quite as strong a positive reaction as most of the critics for a few reasons. First, while avoiding movie clichs for the most part, a couple of key 'twists' are broadcast a mile off, dampening their impact. Also, by making his lead character such a cipher (he not only doesn't speak English, but seems inward and withdrawn even among his fellow Chinese), that it's hard to build up a connection with him as a character. Yes, we can pity his plight, but I wanted to understand what was going on in his head. Also, the shaky-cam shooting style occasionally called more attention to itself then I think it was intended to.

It reminded me a bit in tone of Ramin Bahrani's terrific ""Man Push Cart"", but for me that early work had a little more poetry and richness.

None-the-less, an intelligent, well-meaning micro budget film (it looks like it was shot on regular definition video), and - given my fondness for Baker's more recent films - I'll certainly go back for another look.",1315958400,,1651,4.698961937716263
3903926,4,B002C68WSW,"I saw this movie around the same time I saw ""Nobody Knows"" and was already sufficiently depressed. Overall, I really enjoyed Take Out. It feels like a documentary, very realistic and almost tedious in the details of this one day in the life of a Chinese food delivery guy.

I will say, make sure you have some good takeout Chinese to go with this. No movie could possibly make you hungrier!

Most of the scenes take place in a place similar to those Tops China or China Star kind of Chinese takeout you see everrryyywhere..the ones with the exact same plastic photos of each dish over the counter, no real seating, just a few folks cooking in the back.  It also takes you into the life of a delivery person, who are probably being underpaid and under tipped. This poor man has to deliver in New York, in the rain, on his crummy bike. He owes money to basically a loan shark and is just hoping to make enough 'today' to cover his payment.

This movie is not pretty, not a feel-good movie, but it's so realistic. I enjoyed it. it's different in a good way. Give it a try. It will make you notice some of the more overlooked people around you and teach you that everyone, everyone has issues, a life, a history.",1309305600,2,1208,4.355555555555555

By the end of my first viewing, I was so blown away by both its accuracy and emotional effectiveness that I had to get the dvd.  The more I watch it, the clearer it becomes at how subtly and masterfully the story was molded.  Certain scenes especially impressed me as I realized, while watching it a 2nd, 3rd time, they were deliberately painted and unfolded in certain ways, both to show the ""real"" side of working in a typical take-out joint (along with the broad spectrum of New Yorkers they visit/serve) and also the sense of humanity in characters such as him.

Anyway, the whole story was incredibly realistic; the actors did a really good job in their portrayal of Chinese immigrants and the life they endure in the big city. And I found myself rooting for Ming the whole time. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend this film!",1281571200,2,578,4.411214953271028
3903962,5,B002C68WSW,"Saw this at Symphony Space on the Upper West Side of Manhattan where the movie takes place so obviously I've been in that neighborhood. However, I've never really considered the lives of the nearly ubiquitous Chinese delivery guys and what they must go through on a daily basis.

If you're expecting a plot driven film, you'll be disappointed, but if you want to be taken to a world you've never been before with a beautifully gritty cinema verite style, you won't be disappointed. The realism is striking. A very impressive effort from these first time feature directors.",1281225600,,572,4.896907216494846
3903963,5,B002C68WSW,"TAKE OUT is great story-telling in a socially and aesthetically principled style.  Shot in a way that keeps us grounded in real lives, TAKE OUT gives us a complex view of one day in the life of a non-documented immigrant trying to make money in NY city delivering take out food.  As one would expect, it does a powerful job insisting on the full human-ness of the immigrants in the story.  One wishes that every anti-immigrant politician would have to watch and participate in a public discussion of this film -- along with several other important recent films about the lives of immigrants in the US now.  TAKE OUT is a lasting piece of art and social commentary.",1281225600,,664,4.601694915254237
3903964,5,B002C68WSW,"TAKE OUT is a wonderful movie that takes a humanistic lens to the strife and struggle of just one of the masses of people who make up the bottom rung of the work force in NYC (or any other major city, I imagine), like the delivery men or cleaning ladies...so foreign to us, yet so integral to our daily city life.  You leave the movie feeling good and at the same time introspective.  The acting, most of it done by first-time actors, is great, and the performance delivered by Charles Jang, its lead actor, is so good that you would think he was an actual delivery man taken off his delivery route for the role.  I highly recommend it!!!",1281139200,,638,4.34453781512605
3903965,5,B002C68WSW,"""A remarkable film, purportedly made for three thousand dollars, by Sean Baker and Shih-Ching Tsou. Ming (Charles Jang), an illegal Chinese immigrant, tries to make enough money in one day working as a delivery boy to pay off the thugs who smuggled him to the States. Revolving around a hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant on the Upper West Side--where the front of the house is in the loving care of Big Sister (the utterly winning Wang-Thye Lee)--Baker and Tsou's simple narrative feels like a richly authentic documentary. The terrific cast is led by Jang (amazingly, a Long Island native), who plays Ming as a determined, reticent man who seethes deeply within his shell."" -- The New Yorker",1281139200,,694,5.043478260869565
3903966,5,B002C68WSW,"I loved this movie--it gives such an awesome and honest depiction of immigrant struggles in New York City while simultaneously surveying the breadth of the NY lifestyles and how they all come together over the ordering of Chinese food. From broker to rapper, immigrant to Wasp and how they all relate to the broken englished delivery guy trying to make it one day at a time. so simple and poignant.",1281052800,,398,4.7
8363207,3,B002C68WSW,I normally give five stars only because if I'm not happy with the product I just return it. This movie is required for my study material so I have to keep it. But the movie is not professionally created. Story is ok.,1526947200,,216,4.166666666666667

8363213,4,B002C68WSW,"Interesting independent film.  I normally don't like when films seem to be made by a guy with a camera that follows the characters all day long, but this film's subject matter was interesting.  It wasn't about watching two dope fiends lovers or something tiresome like that.  I felt anxiousness wondering if the main character would get the money he needed to pay the people who helped him get to America.  There was also an interesting take on 'don't judge a book by its cover' or 'we share more in common that you know'  when you see the photo of his wife and child and then the attack on his life.",1464739200,,600,4.418181818181818
