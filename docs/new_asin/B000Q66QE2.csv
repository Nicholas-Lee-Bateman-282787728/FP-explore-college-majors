I love a good ghost documentary that features the real thing, without a bunch of obvious bs.  This is just that, & I appreciated it.",1374883200,,290,4.333333333333333
8194320,3,B000Q66QE2,"Like recent cable TV shows, this takes you into a haunted environment, in this instance a building in York, England, thought to be the most haunted city in Britain for a psychic experience. Night-vision camera allows you to watch the psychic channel the energy of spirits as if you were there. Also included is interview footage with Martin Jeffrey of Britain's Fright Nights, who explains the difference between actual paranormal experience and the natural physical response to a pitch-dark room and anticipated ghost-sightings.",1350777600,,529,5.385542168674699
8194321,4,B000Q66QE2,"A fascinating look at paranormal happenings in York, England.  Amazing footage of ""ghosthunters"" as they explore the ghostly history of this medieval village.  The original score is great and definitely enhances the mood of the documentary.  A must see for anyone interested in the occult.",1206057600,,289,5.377777777777778
8194322,4,B000Q66QE2,"So scary because it is real.  At times the reminded me of that show ""Ghost Hunters"" but this seemed far scarier to me.  Watch out for the ending.  A lot of very interesting information in addition to some very scary parts.  The false ghosts parts were revealing.  I really liked it and almost wished it was a little longer.",1204243200,,323,4.406779661016949

8194324,1,B000Q66QE2,"I read the reviews on this movie before i bought it. And i was led to believe that it was going to be good. But all it was, was a bunch of interviews, and a guy saying a ghost took over his body and which his acting was fake. And you can hardley understand anything they are saying cause the sound quality on the movie is bad. So it's not worth geting at all.",1189814400,3,359,3.864864864864865
