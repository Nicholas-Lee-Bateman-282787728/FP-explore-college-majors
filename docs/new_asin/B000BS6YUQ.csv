8091765,1,B000BS6YUQ,"This is the most boring DVD I have seen!  My child has no interest in this.
The production quality is terrible.  The puppets are cheap.  The camera man can't even stay in focus.  Now I need to figure out how to send these back.",1232755200,,227,4.090909090909091

8091768,5,B000BS6YUQ,"Thank you for this DVD, it put a smile in my kids face and mine too. My Toddler loves the video. Introduces babies and toddlers to numbers and shapes. Also it was wonderful to hear songs that I learned during my childhood.  The songs are traditional Spanish Songs such as A la Feria de San Juan, Los pollitos dicen, El barco chiquito. I was happy to sing along with them (booklet with all songs is included).  The kids like the puppets and The numbers and figures are repeated which I found to be great because my toddler repeats the words with them.  My kids don't get bored watching the video, they want to see it over and over again",1188950400,3,635,4.319327731092437
8091769,5,B000BS6YUQ,"I have been trying many Spanish language DVDs, and these seem to be just about the best out there.  My grandchildren love the music, colors & puppets, and love to move around and dance and sing along.  I really like the DVD becase they can learn spanish and real spanish children's songs (the ones that I know, not made up).  My 2 year old grandson is already counting to ten in spanish and singing the songs.  We love these DVDs!",1188950400,,430,4.3375
8091770,5,B000BS6YUQ,"My two kids really like this video, they love the puppets and animated parts, and they love to count along, as they already know some Spanish numbers.  I love this DVD because it has many well-known Spanish songs that I sang when I was growing up.  Plus the paper insert in the case has all the lyrics, making it fairly easy for my wife (a non Spanish speaker) to help children learn the songs, and even she is now singing along.  As a Latino with a bilingual family, I think it is great that there are DVDs like this - with native accents and great music - that really work well in what we try to achieve with teaching language to our children.",1162857600,5,645,4.227642276422764
8091771,1,B000BS6YUQ,"This DVD is very poorly done.  The Spanish spoken by the cheap-looking puppets is not clearly articulated and there are no English or Spanish subtitles.  There are a couple songs in Spanish, but again no subtitles, so it sounds like inarticulate rambling to children who don't speak Spanish.  More attention to audio/visual detail and consideration of how children learn is needed.  We wasted our money on this purchase for our twin daughters, and suggest you make a different purchase.",1162598400,3,486,5.113924050632911
8091772,5,B000BS6YUQ,"My children love this video... they love to count along in each segment as the numbers get progressive higher, and they adore the way the shapes transform into common objects.  They sing and dance every time they watch, and already know most of the songs.  Their spanish language skills are already better because they relate the spanish lyrics into conversational spanish.  I love the songs and music, and the fact that my littlest one is really learning his numbers and shapes in Spanish from watching this.",1139270400,5,509,4.895348837209302
