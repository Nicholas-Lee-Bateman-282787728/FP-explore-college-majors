8194630,5,B000Q6NTNS,"George Cukor's DINNER AT EIGHT is an excellent Herman Mankiewitz/Frances Marion adaptation of the George S. Kaufman/Edna Ferber stage play.

In this evocative Great Depression emsemble piece, we see affluence fallen on hard times, a once sought-after actor unable to find work, a prototype corporate raider fueding with his low-born wife and a matronly actress forced to sell a major part of her stock portfolio.

Society dame Millicent Jordan (Burke) cheerfuily arranges a dinner party, unaware that husband Oliver (Lionel B.) is about to lose everything-- his steamship company and something far more important. Bitter words between coarsely unscrupulous businessman Dan Packard (Beery) and his floozy wife Kitty (Harlow) are fueled by Dan's well-founded suspicion that she's cheating on him. Packard has been secretly buying up stock in Oliver's company to effect a takeover.

One-time screen idol Larry Renault (John B.) hides behind a haze of alcohol from the disaster his life has become. On the verge of eviction from his hotel suite, Larry blows one final chance-- a walk-on part in a stage production. Larry's agent, Max Kane (Tracy) has had enough of his washed-up client. Carlotta Vance (Dressler), an actress whose fame faded in the early 20th Century, spends her days visiting with wealthy fans and nursing chronic foot problems. Despite physical infirmities, advancing age and a shortness of cash, Carlotta's mordant wit has yet to fail her.

Carlotta, Larry and the Packards have been invited to Mrs. Jordan's dinner party. Everything starts to unravel when the guests of honor, a British blueblood couple cancel with little notice. Millicent is so preoccupied with her imminent social disaster that she barely notices Oliver's arrival home after he's gotten devastatng news from his doctor. Meanwhile, Larry Renault's booze and money have both run out and at noon tomorrow he'll be homeless...
