7541667,5,B0189HKF14,Just got it today on release date. This is the ultimate Hunger Games package with all of them included. Can't wait to rip it open tonight and start watching from the start to the end. I know what I'll be doing for the next several hours! Includes over 14 hours of bonus footage never seen before. Can't wait.,1458604800,3,308,4.327586206896552
7541668,5,B0189HKF14,"I pre-ordered this over the weekend and it arrived today. I love having the DVD and digital copies of all four films in the series. The digital format makes it easy to watch these without having to unplug my Roku and hook up the DVD player. This will make for a fun movie night to watch all four back-to-back. I love this series, the graphics and the story. I just watched Mockingjay part 2 and I have to say it is my least favorite of the four but it is still very good. I think I hyped it up too much in my own mind. I will say there is one scene in the last film that reminds me of ""The Descent"". I just feel like the last half hour was a bit rushed. It still doesn't knock the complete down from 5-stars for me.",1458604800,51,715,3.9379310344827587
7541669,5,B0189HKF14,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure this'll be great. All movies for $50 bucks and on BLURAY, you can't beat that. And the book looks cool.",1457654400,12,125,4.25
7541670,5,B0189HKF14,Looking forward to buying this when it comes out! All 4 movies blueray for only $50 that's a great deal!,1457222400,11,104,4.25
7541671,4,B0189HKF14,"This seems like a much cheaper version. Blu plastic case instead of nicer cardboard case w/graphics. Also, the movie redeem site wouldn't take the codes that came with it for digital sdownload, but I went directly into iTunes and it DID take all four even though the card said they may expire after 3/22/2017. Probably the seller's fault, and not Amazon's, but don't feel like going through the hassle to fight for what I actually ordered. :/",1534896000,,442,4.753246753246753
7541672,4,B0189HKF14,The last disk acts really wonky and needs a lot of googling to fix it just to watch the 5th movie.,1534550400,,98,3.7142857142857144

7541680,3,B0189HKF14,"This movie series belongs in any sci-fi/fantasy movie collection. They are fantastic stories, brilliantly told.  As far as I can tell, they follow the story in the books fairly closely. The cinematography is breathtaking, and the blending of CGI and live footage is seamless. Unfortunately, I cannot give the same high scores to the production of these Blu-ray discs.
In a Blu-ray player that works perfectly with all the other discs in my collection, these discs take more than two minutes to load, and appear to lock up the Blu-ray player while they are loading. In fact the only button that worked on the Blu-ray player while these disks are loading was the eject button. I nearly put the discs in the garbage because I thought that they were defective, until one disc finally loaded after waiting approximately two and a half minutes, prompting me to try the other ones.
I *would* advise other folks to purchase these movies, but not this particular edition.",1532390400,,962,4.865853658536586
7541681,5,B0189HKF14,Some of the movies have scenes that were not in the cable version. Seeing them make it very exciting to watch over and over again.,1532304000,,130,4.24
7541682,5,B0189HKF14,All four movies in one collection with ton of extras. I think everyone knows by now how good these movies are enough said.,1531699200,,122,4.3478260869565215
7541683,1,B0189HKF14,The product I received was not the one depicted. It's advertised as a 6-disc box set of all 4 films. However I received a shrink-wrapped collection of 4 individual blu-rays.,1531440000,3,173,4.8

7541694,3,B0189HKF14,"This set is perfect for anyone who is a fan of the movies! Although, I had a problem with what I was buying. When I bought the set it claimed that each of the movies came with a digital code so that you could have a digital copy of the movie. Although 2 of the 4 codes had expired several years ago or a couple of months ago. ( The 2nd and 3rd movie). The last movie's code did not expire til next year, although when I tried to enter the code, it did not work and said it was only valid to customers of the Canadian store. When I contacted Amazon about this they were great and helpful. IT IS NOT AMAZON'S FAULT. They helped me out, and did all they could do. They told me to contact the seller. And when I did, they said they could not give me usable codes. So overall, only 1 of the codes worked for me. Otherwise, this set is amazing for anyone who loves the movies!",1529971200,,870,3.9771428571428573

7541725,5,B0189HKF14,"I'm hooked now.
I saw the first movie when it first came out and wasn't all that impressed.
A few weeks ago I watched it again and was blown away! Had to but the whole series, and recommend it to everyone!",1524182400,,205,4.024390243902439
7541726,5,B0189HKF14,"I didn't know what to expect with this and wasn't sure I'd like it at all. I'm not too enthralled with our current younger generation of child actors, but much to my surprise, this series is very well done and quite engaging. I watched three of them back to back on one cold winter day and next winter will be watching them all again. The action is well done and the acting good. As a dystopian drama it includes elements of Ayn Rand, George Orwell, A. Huxley and probably more giants of the genre. If you're going to get any of them, just get the entire set and get it over with. It's well worth it.",1523923200,,600,4.181034482758621
7541727,1,B0189HKF14,"I purchased this complete collection during the month of September 2017.  I waited couple months to watch Disc 5: Mockingjay Part 2.  To my surprise, the CD was defective.  I tried playing it on my laptop (PC), using my DVD player, and using my Mac book pro laptop. No luck.  I am very disappointed because I purchased this collection to enjoy it whenever I wanted.

7541733,4,B0189HKF14,"David Icke got me interested in this movie, and it was offered at a reasonable price for the complete collection. which was the proper approach for this package. Jennifer Lawrence carried this series with what could be considered a reserved performance, except when I put myself in her shoes and imagined what would it be like living a day to day existence uncertain of everything except death or starvation. She is easy on the eyes or rather just flat out pretty, so, I had to help her thru her adventures. The series makes a powerful political statement and social commentary and is a must have for any movie collector who happens to be a conspiracy theorist .Her choice of suitors had me holding my breath right up to the end.",1522713600,2,729,4.615384615384615

I'd heard a lot about these films and was ready to be entertained and impressed. I was bored. The acting was good, but it all seemed dragged out. A lot of running and too many pauses for long dialog scenes. The costumes were mostly hideous. The last two films really didn't need to be split up. That was an obvious money grab.

The tormented rebellion people and hunger games contestants is a reminder of the suffering some people have endured in places like Syria. Maybe I'm getting more sympathetic in my old age.
As a story this is very entertaining stuff and the action and effects at times are great. But I did find the relentless evil of the guys in charge quite over the top at times. The first 3 1/2 movies had the bad guys winning which I find unusual in these kind of movies.

Some reviewers expressed concern about the packaging not including everything on the product picture. I'm including pictures and explanations of the packaging.
1. Front cover
2. Back Cover
3. Discs sliding out the bottom of the cover
4. Disc holders
5. Back of disc holder (the pictures that look like they come as an extra with this set are simply the back of the disc holder, they are not separate.)
I hope this helps everyone understand that in one way you are getting everything pictured, it just doesn't come the way you may expect. Personally I'm not rating down for the packaging because after reading reviews of people who said they didn't get everything pictured, I wasn't expecting anything but the six blu ray discs, in a case. I do recommend the blu rays as they seem to have fewer issues than the DVDs. Mine don't have any issues.

I'm not going to return it, because I want a box set, but I will have to order Mockingjay 2 separately to get a working copy.

I probably bit the bullet a little too quickly, though, as I interpreted that the ""digital copy"" would mean these movies would be available under my movies on Amazon video.  What I found out was that this refers only to a little used online video service and that they ARE NOT available on my Amazon video.  Had I determined that prior to purchase I would not have purchased this set.  The video service requires a software download, registration and other ""let me at your data"" elements.  I will probably never use the streaming service.  I feel somewhat misled, but it was probably somewhere in the fine print.  As far as the movies go, this is an excellent set.

We now have a lot of family movie nights and we watch the movies with a 10 foot diagonal projected HD screen. The Blu-ray Discs just have better quality video and we prefer to watch them so we purchased the BLU-RAY set.

This is a good set of discs and the video quality is very good. I had no issues with the disc at all. This is a great set of films and for the promotion price they were hard to pass up. I am glad we got them and we enjoyed watching them.  The set is actually 6 discs. It includes a lot of extra features for the films and if you are a fan you will enjoy watching these add on features.

The set includes:
 The Hunger Games
 The Hunger Games Bonus Features
 Catching Fire
 Mockingjay Part 1
 Mockingjay Part 2
 The complete 4 film collection bonus features
 A code sheet that will allow you to download the digital HD films for all four disks so you can watch your films on your smart phones or tablets or PC.

Just a comment, be careful when putting the discs back into the case. It is designed the have the bottom disc partially tucked under the mounting tab for the top disc and that is not really clearly obvious. Make sure you do not scratch your discs and damage them.  This is a good set of discs and they are worth owning.  My family has enjoyed owning these BluRay discs as well as the digital versions for streaming. This is a good buy and we had fun watching the movies and adding them to our movie library!

I enjoyed all of these movies and it is nice to get them in one complete set.

As soon as we got them we had a Hunger Games marathon movie watching party.",1478995200,28,1700,4.109090909090909

7542140,3,B0189HKF14,"Not a film review. This is a packaging review.

I ordered this set and was surprised to see that the plastic in it is very brittle and easily broken. The item was shipped safely but, in spite of that, it arrived with the plastic inserts, which are glued into a cardboard folding sleeve, shattered in places, like glass. The little plastic shards had scratched up the discs which had nowhere to rest, due to the tabs all breaking out in the back half of the set and, of course, we arranged return and ordered a replacement. What I failed to notice, when attempting to repackage it for return in accordance with the representative's instructions, was that the break points, the places from which the loose plastic shards had broken, where, as you would expect, incredibly sharp. Needless to say, I foolishly sliced my hand on one of them.

What is the point? Be careful with this set, as the plastic is unusually brittle and, if broken, will break in a very sharp, glass like fashion. The plastic in this is not like the nice soft plastic they use in blue Blu-ray and black DVD cases. This is a very sharp, hard, clear plastic they have used in this set, glued into a flimsy and thin cardboard folding case that is not sturdy enough to protect the plastic. The outer sleeve is a slightly thicker cardboard but it wasn't enough to protect this set just as my vision wasn't enough to spot those sharp edges and protect my hand.

If you order this, just be careful and pay attention to any cracks or breaks in that plastic.

Update:  Replacement arrived and it is broken. Now, it isn't as broken as the first one and was in decent enough shape to hand off to the recipient who will check the discs to see if they are good but, for the record, this packaging uses a terribly brittle plastic that leaves the discs floating around inside due to breaks in those silly tabs. Be aware of the problem and order early if you are ordering for a gift (and open it and check it before gifting it). Good luck.

Update to the update:  He checked the discs and gave this one back to me. He said that three of the discs were skipping and freezing and pixellating. I wasn't sure what that meant, as to what the pixellating would look like, until I checked the reviews of this item and saw photos. When I asked him if it looked like big cubes of the photo mixed up or jumbled on screen, out of place, he said yes. Basically, in addition to the standard disc flaws of skipping and freezing, it has a pixellation problem. The discs, on inspection, appear perfect, no scratches or defects of any kind, but they play like there is something terribly wrong with them. Be careful with this item and make sure you check those discs immediately. Good luck with this one.",1478736000,3,2740,4.435387673956263

7542247,5,B0189HKF14,"To begin, I love the author's writing style. I did not think the films had much chance of living up to the novels. I am pleasantly surprised. What a journey. Beautifully scripted, wonderfully acted, great cinematography and even if you had a good idea what was about to happen, it was done so well that it did not matter. Read the novels then see the films - or go at it the other way around. As with the Harry Potter series, you should do both (although, to read someone who like King and Bradbury and Dickens knows the music of the words - more so here: go for the read as well). And beyond that - it's not just action-adventure. It is heartbreakingly relevant to the world today. Given the animals - one might even call a fable for pour times.",1469059200,2,746,4.297872340425532

7542271,4,B0189HKF14,"I really loved the books and was psyched for the movies. It's widely believed that the books are better and I'd say that's true. However, I really enjoyed these movies, my favorite being Catching Fire. I think the final movie isn't as good as the rest, but that's so often the case with serial films. The acting is all fantastic. This collection has way more to it than I needed-I just wanted the movies-but that's how it always is with these. I was a bit annoyed at the free digital copy, as it was a real pain to get it -- multiple accounts at places I'd never heard of and whose pages repeatedly failed to work correctly. Whole registration for the digital copy took over an hour, actually. I was hoping it'd play through my TV, like the Star Wars digital download, but no dice.

I have a decent DVD player and I ended up returning the first set because I thought the discs were unreadable.  When I got the second set I had the same problem.  As I was pondering why the disc would not load the movies and was reading my DVD instruction manual for any possible solutions, the movie FINALLY loaded.  I find that it can take from 3-5 minutes to load the movies on these discs.  Once the movie is playing the quality if excellent.

Still.. the special effects are convincing and the movies did a fair job of representing the books... Read the books if you'd like more info about each of the episodes.  It is enlightening... and in some ways made me appreciate the movies a bit more.  I love Jennifer Lawrence... she is a young lady with a future.  I would say ok for age 10 years and older.. there are tough themes and some violence.

After that, I was very excited to see the movies again. Love the movies and the books -- they will make you think a little differently about politics without having to delve into conspiracy theorism.

7542597,5,B0189HKF14,I gave this 5 stars as I'm reviewing the product not the movie even though I felt the first two movies were great followed by two somewhat disappointing sequels.  I like the packaging of the box set and also like the it came with digital copies of all four movies.

7542600,1,B0189HKF14,"The last two movies, which should have been just one movie were terrible. Jenifer Lawrence showed that she really can't act as anything but eye candy. The closing scene was so obvious, I told my wife what was going to happen before it happened (and I didn't read the books). Usually I hate it when a movie deviates from the book, but in this case, the ending of the movie should have deviated from the horrible book ending. It was one of the worst endings to a movie I have ever seen! To me it made the entire series bad. Would not recommend Jenifer Lawrence movies to anyone and would not recommend more than the first movie in this series. Besides the ending, the movie was very disjointed, and some of the cuts were really bad! Not worth the money. Just buy the first one and forget about the rest, esp. the last two!",1460073600,,820,4.3311688311688314
7542601,4,B0189HKF14,"Had hoped for better packaging for a complete set.  Once I got past the outer package, the inner is better.  Would not consider it a collector set (not advertised as one).

7542628,5,B0189HKF14,"It is hard to resist the action culture that is so well presented by Hollywood. First we saw the films, and then we followed our daughters advice and read the very well written books. All in all, the series is entertaining enough to have as part of our video collection. As the Amazon price was very competitive with what the local stores are now offering... it seemed a wise order.",1459382400,,382,4.4714285714285715

7542631,5,B0189HKF14,Bought this set on prerelease.... had already read all the books and seen all the movies.

Mockingjay Part 2 was so messed up I finally just started watching the version I'd downloaded to iTunes, as the disk seemed to jump from scene to scene completely ruining the flow of the story.",1459036800,24,360,4.73015873015873

7542659,5,B0189HKF14,"The box set includes the four movies plus two disc full of extra features. Audio good, video good.

7542661,4,B0189HKF14,"Books were better. The franchise started strong but weakened. Great performances. As in a review of ""Hustle and Flow"" Jennifer Lawrence is the best young actress since Jodie Foster. Woody Harrelson role was solid. We have a chance to see the talents of Philip Seymour Hoffman one last time. Julianne Moore was ice queen perfect and her persona enhanced her physical beauty. I was nervous about the final battle scene and how it was handled. To me the most touching in Mocking jay Part II was the emotional scene between Kadniss and Buttercup. The first moive was brilliant Catching Fire was good but the last two brought the franchise down.",1458950400,,640,4.827272727272727

7542698,3,B0189HKF14,"I came late both to books and films but really loved the strong female heroine aspects.  After what had been done to Peeta in the Capitol and Katniss' belief that he was lost to her forever, her need to rid Panel of Snow and her transformation to hard core assassin also appeared perfectly natural and she and her team tackle that task admirably.  What got old was the over emphasis on bang, bang, blow up, kill here, watch your friends die, move on, ad nauseam.  The last book highlighted a blossoming friendship between Johanna and Katniss while the film barely hinted at this because we had more explosions to plan. There are many more examples where Suzanne Collins apparently just caved in.  Finally, the last five minutes which supposedly had Katniss and Peers growing back together absolutely sucked.  There was no need for any extended sex or nude scenes but judging from the passionate beach scene in ""Catching Fire"" both actors were certainly capable of demonstrating their love without ever showing a sliver of skin. SPOILER! Instead, we get a mumbled rendition of the book's well-known ending line, they never even kiss and the screen goes to black and that's it.  I can only suppose the kids in the epilogue were acquired through osmosis. And who put rebel Katniss in that 50's wifey/mommy dress?  Loved the books and first two movies. Mockingly should have been one longish movie with a better planned and better last five minutes.",1458691200,6,1445,4.825910931174089

7542700,1,B0189HKF14,"Bought this set so I could have all the movies in a set, but ultimately  got it because I had not seen the last movie. In the last movie about half way threw it a cinavia pop-up blocks the screen that says the audio isn't authorized to play on my blue ray  player. I contacted Amazon and they sent me another copy. Just to have the same thing happen. I then looked up the error code online and it says it only does that when its a unauthorized copy of the movie. I have never experienced this with any of my other movies. Won't be buying any other movies online because I can't tell if it has the cinavia software on it. Makes movie watching impossible with a huge pop-up in the middle of the screen saying that the audio isn't aloud to play on my DVD player.
