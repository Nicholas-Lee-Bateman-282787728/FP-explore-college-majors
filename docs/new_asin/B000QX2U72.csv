8197892,5,B000QX2U72,"A great movie, filmed in Delisle Saskatchewan. I knew a man that had worked in that town in the early 60's and had seen this movie and said that was EXACTLY what it was like there. In fact, when I saw this movie when it was first released I was sold on convertibles and have owned them ever since. If you look up Delisle Sask. on the internet today you will see a photo of the main street with the bar and there aren't too many changes.
This is a hard to get movie for whatever reason but well worth the effort in acquiring it.",1289779200,3,527,4.0285714285714285
