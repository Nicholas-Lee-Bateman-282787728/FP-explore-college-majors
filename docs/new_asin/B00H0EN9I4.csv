8628948,4,B00H0EN9I4,My daughter (4 years old) loves this show! An i enjoy it too :) i dident give it 4 stars because i feel it should have had 2 or 3 more epasodes. it will get old fast! We don't have netflix or cable or anything(cant afford at the moment) an so i can buy a couple new dvds every month an i like good deals like henery huggle monster is a brand new show an had like 10 or more epasodes. this only has four epasodes. However im stil glad i got it because it is aa cute show.,1410480000,,470,3.757575757575758
8628949,5,B00H0EN9I4,"My kids (3.5 and 7) LOVE Justin Time and can't get enough, watching the two seasons on Netflix over and over.  Now they have Justin Time on the go.  It teaches about other cultures, past and present, and a little natural history, too.  The animation is aesthetically pleasing, which is great for parents who have to watch, too!  The characters are likeable and sweet.  Some of the episodic accessory characters are even delightful!  The only character even remotely ""annoying"" (and I use that term loosely) is Justin, who is a bit self-centered...but, he is the one learning and growing in each episode, so I guess it's kind of necessary. He has a phony laugh, too, but hey, the rest makes up for it!

This show is a pleasant one, it's not pandering or condescending, with excellent subject matter you won't find on any other kids' show.  And I don't ever get tired of hearing it or seeing it, which is a big deal for a kids' program!!

I also recommend the two books:
