8593033,5,B00DGVX0MA,"Another great documentary by Jason Dobbins. Dobbins, an award winning director, shows the life and times of an interesting entertainer, Travis Vandal. It will give you a look into the struggles that Vandal faces daily to balance work and his real passion of entertaining. Dobbins does an amazing job at showing you all aspects of the struggle in a story that will leave you cheering for Vandal. It is another well done documentary by this established and talented director and worth a look.",1371859200,,490,4.9156626506024095
8593034,5,B00DGVX0MA,"As an enormous documentary fan I have seen quite a few, always clamoring to any involving my home state of West Virginia.  To say that I was pleased with this film would be a complete understatement.  Between the documentary itself and it's generous amount of extras (the outtakes being my personal favorite) we had a taste of everything to enjoy.  Young director Jason Dobbins displayed a knack for storytelling seldom seen from young professionals of today.  He made sure to document all the hats that Travis Vandal wears on an every day basis and did not limit his film to just singing and songwriting.  Equally as impressive is the amount of things Vandal can fit into one day.  Whether you're a documentary fan, WV historian, fan of music or just plain great storytelling this is definitely one to check out.",1371600000,,813,4.771428571428571
