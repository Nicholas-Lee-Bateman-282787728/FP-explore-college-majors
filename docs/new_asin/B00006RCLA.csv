7972345,4,B00006RCLA,"The film quality is scratchy and the selection of cartoons somewhat random (Casper peters out after a few episodes and is replaced with Popeye, and others), but the material is wonderful. Not the bland comic book character of the 1960s, this Casper is somewhat edgier: one cartoon addresses the death of Casper's animal pal who then becomes a ghosts himself, suggesting, perhaps, the big central question of Casper's existence:
Was he a boy who died before he became a ghost?",1388620800,,475,4.95
7972346,4,B00006RCLA,"Although this DVD is no longer available except via used copies, you get nine old classic cartoons lasting a little over an hour at a very cheap price. Only five of the nine are actually Casper cartoons. However, these include three very early entries from the 1940's including the first Casper cartoon made in 1945. There is also a rare glimpse at 1948's ""Good Boos Tonight"". All other Caspers I ever saw had a happy ending, but this being only the second one ever made, I guess they were still experimenting with the format. In ""Good Boos"" the stark image of Casper's mourning is graphic and disturbing, and the violence is rather steep, even for 1940's standards. I remember ""Good Boos"" making me cry as a child, and I think as an adult it is even sadder. ""Boo Moon"" is the only Casper toon in 3-D, and it has a plotline that's radically different from Casper's usual self-pity routine with some action that is genuinely scary. Gigantic walking trees with leering faces come striding across the lunar landscape. This is creepy enough in flat 2-D format, but it's truly unnerving in 3-D.

The other four cartoons are not Caspers. Two of them are Popeye cartoons that are rare in the sense that Popeye does not eat his spinach and wind up fighting Bluto as part of the conclusion. Another is an old Felix the Cat from the 30's in his technicolor debut. This version of Felix is an insipidly cheerful character that is devoid of the spunk that ordinarily makes Felix memorable. The uncredited actress who provides Felix's voice pleasingly carries a tune but the sweet singing doesn't provide anything unique about the character.

The last cartoon stars Betty Boop and is the only black-and-white cartoon on the disc. There are scenes in this short that probably shocked the various moral watchdogs of 1933 and is obviously pre-code. Bimbo and Koko are both in this one and this is a prime example of what can be done with animation when the animators realize that the intended audience was composed not only of children, but adults as well. The Fleischers did some marvelous work and this is an excellent sample of it. Here's a short description of each cartoon offered:

Casper the Friendly Ghost (1945) - Depressed by the antics of the other ghosts, Casper leaves home to make friends. After unintentionally scaring several potential pals, Casper befriends two young children. They take him home, where Casper frightens their mother. Casper is again upset because he believes that he will always scare away his potential buddies. However, Casper scares away a banker who is coming to foreclose on the woman's house, and this wins her heart for Casper. This is the first Casper cartoon ever made.

A-Haunting We Will Go (1949) - After playing class dunce at Ghost School for wanting to make friends instead of scaring people, Casper locates a duck, just hatched from its egg, that will accept him for what he is. Casper takes the young duck under his proverbial wing and the two find happiness together although a hunter looking for a meal of duck sounds proves a most hazardous threat to Casper's newfound friend.

There's Good Boos To-Night (1948) - Casper goes looking for friends among the animal kingdom. After scaring away a cow and a skunk, Casper sits on a log to cry. His tears attract a little fox cub. They play fetch, and then start to play hide and seek when a hunter comes along.

Boo Moon (1954) - Casper flies to the the moon and is captured and imprisoned by the moon people. When he helps defend the planet from the invading tree monsters, then he is finally embraced as a friend.

Spooking About Africa (1957) -  Wheezy the elephant has a terrible sneezing problem; he sneezes all the feathers off a peacock and a group of monkeys out of their perches. Casper decides to help, and in the process dislodges the feather that was making the elephant sneeze. But then a fire breaks out, and the elephant is unable to sneeze on command.

Fright to the Finish (1954) - Olive Oyl reads a scary tale to Popeye and Bluto. Popeye says it's all rubbish. Bluto then returns to frighten Olive and make it look like Popeye did it. Popeye, in turn, scares away Bluto.

I Don't Scare (1956) - Popeye has beaten Bluto to a date with Olive. Seeing that Olive is superstitious, Bluto changes the date to Friday the 13th, and proceeds to rig various proofs that bad things will happen if she goes out.

Bold King Cole (1936) - Caught in a thunderstorm, Felix the Cat seeks refuge in King Cole's castle. The castle's ghosts can't stand the king's bragging, so they strap him to a machine to suck the wind out of him. It happens to be the wind that makes him a windbag. It's quite bizarre watching the rotund king deflate like a balloon. Then the ghosts expose him to the gas which exudes all his boastings. The king learns it's not nearly as fun listening to his speech as it is making it. A fascinating sequence that has to be seen to be believed, it effectively exploits the essential unreality of animation.

Is My Palm Read (1933) - Bimbo is a fortune teller; Koko is his doorman; Bimbo looks into his crystal ball and sees Betty stranded on a tropical island after a steamship wreck. Betty then gets trapped inside a haunted grass hut on the island and Bimbo comes to her rescue. Back at the fortune telling booth, Bimbo reveals himself, but ghosts come out of the crystal ball and start chasing the trio. If this seems weird and surreal, it's because it is.",1167436800,3,5462,4.631198347107438
7972347,1,B00006RCLA,"This is the worst DVD ever. It's not restored. The ""Spooking About Africa"" is the worst print I've ever seen on a public domain tape or DVD. I have a high tolerance for scratches and such since I've watched PD tapes all my life, but this is a joke.

They added sound effects into these shorts and it totally didn't work. It sounds like it was done in my basement. They ruined some of the best cartoons of all time by releasing this sack of feces.

I'm a serious classic animation fan. The reviewer there with kids obviously has never watched the cartoons in their original format or has paid no attention to them since he or she saw them as a child. The children don't know the difference. The other reviewer, well, I just don't know...",1119484800,,736,4.364963503649635

I have noticed some great reviews and some mixed reviews about this product with most of the negative ones being ghost written by our competition so i wanted to tell everyone the real truth about this product since we are the people who produced it. I am using my wifes Amazon account to post this.

 We have taken some of the greatest classic cartoons ever produced, from some of the greatest animators in history, and meticulously added hundreds of hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars of detailed restoration to both the sound and images in order to make them look as good as they did the day they were first released. Each cartoon is digitally processed first through photo shop frame by frame, and then using both the Davinci and the new Pogo systems to remove every scratch, line, dropout and artifact possible. We then we do a full color restoration at Technicolor using the original color palates to match the colors, tones and shades. We then digitally clean up the sound track to remove all the hiss and scratches and carefully add new foley sound effects, ambience and digitally remix them back onto the cartoons.

The result is our animated DVD series which is currently distributed in both the United States and Canada by Goodtimes Entertainment. These fully restored, full motion, color animations have not been seen in this condition since their original theatrical release. Sit back and be amazed and enjoy some of the finest and funniest animation ever made.

thats why were to only studio doing these that have the blessing and participation of Fleischer Studios and the only one to receive the prestigious Gold Medal from the Classic Animation Preservation Society.

I highly recomend this product to any lovers of classic animation.",1112054400,4,1785,4.913621262458472
