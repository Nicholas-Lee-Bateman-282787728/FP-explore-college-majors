8321137,5,B001MEM7CM,"Pretty much All the Bill Nye Videos are great and my kids love them.
Watch them over and over and actually learn information unlike most other school type videos.
It's great that science and knowledge is finally COOL and society is finally drifting away from ignorance and stupidity.",1395878400,,283,4.916666666666667
8321138,5,B001MEM7CM,The Bill Nye Video on the Sun is right up there in quality with all the other Bill Nye Videos.  We have the whole series of Bill Nye Videos and love them all. We recently purchased The Sun to replace our worn out one.,1382832000,,217,3.9318181818181817
8321139,5,B001MEM7CM,"Bill Nye series are great for introducing kids to science in a fun way and sparking their interest in study of nature. Bill talks about how nature works with many jokes, stunts, and other entertaining ways.

They are not for teaching formal science literacy of issues such as how to set up and experiment, how to gather data, derive conclusions from results, basically not about how you think about stuff as a scientist.

Bill is now the head of the Planetary Society trying to promote space exploration. I don't know if he still makes these DVDs.",1369008000,,547,4.6875
8321140,5,B001MEM7CM,I bought this for my son's 3rd grade class.  The kids love watching these videos and I was able to help out the teacher too!,1355616000,2,124,3.96
8321141,5,B001MEM7CM,"Bill Nye is excellent at making fun and interesting science videos for kids. This one covers spiders and flowers. He covers spider anatomy and the role of insect-eaters in the lifecycle. The second video covers flowers, structure, purpose. This sounds boring but is not.

All the Bill Nye videos are funny and interesting, moving quickly from one aspect of the given topic to another, and repeating the most important parts over and over without getting annoying. Some of the sections are corney or dumb, but they are aware of this and laugh at themselves, which appeals to my kids.

All 4 of my children (13, 10, 6 and 3) adore the videos, and the older ones have picked up a great deal of science knowledge and understanding from the series. You can often rent them from the library, but we like them so much we have purchased them to watch over and over at home.",1261872000,,865,4.574193548387097
