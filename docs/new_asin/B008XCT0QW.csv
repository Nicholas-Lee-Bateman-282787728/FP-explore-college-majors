8532080,4,B008XCT0QW,As a cyclist I enjoyed this documentary. I have to say that it makes the TDF seem easier than I know it is.,1510617600,,107,3.6956521739130435
8532081,5,B008XCT0QW,"A great insight to the TDF and to the Schleck Bros. It won't explain the nuances or strategies but if you're into cycling, you'll love it.",1498608000,,138,4.346153846153846
8532082,5,B008XCT0QW,"I watched this online as part of my Prime membership.  I've watched a lot of cycling documentaries and this ones ranks among the best.  It focuses almost entirely on Frank and Andy and everyone else serves as supporting actors.  It's not the best introduction to professional racing because it doesn't attempt to educate about what's going, but that's not what it was meant to do either.  It is very personal inside look at Frank and Andy; their personal feelings, their relationship with each other and their father.

For a good introduction to professional riding and especially the Tour de France, I recommend ""Hell on Wheels"" (https://www.amazon.com/Hell-Wheels-Lance-Armstrong/dp/B017UJB728/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&qid=1483917644&sr=8-19&keywords=hell+on+wheels).",1483833600,,764,6.169811320754717

8532084,4,B008XCT0QW,The only issue is that it won't play on a typical American DVD player... but the movie is great fun!,1369440000,,100,4.05
