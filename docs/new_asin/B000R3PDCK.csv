8198707,1,B000R3PDCK,"i was disappointed in this dance lesson dvd. i was expecting more from this two dancers. well i made a mistake.  john is just a starting student in ballroom dancing so it is pretty obvious he cannot teach well.  john depended all his cues from his partner who is a seasoned dancer but the dvd fell short. they cramped several dances in this one dvd so they only teach one or two steps per ballroom dance and it is not enough even for a beginner.  it is not advisable to buy a dance lesson dvd with all the dances in one dvd because the teachers in it will just teach a few steps so as to fit it in one dvd for a limited one hour of running time.  i suggest you buy one dance for one dvd so the lessons would be comprehensive.  don't buy 10 dances in 1 dvd for one hour running time, that is ridiculous, that is not enough to learn anything from it.",1250640000,2,848,4.023809523809524

Charlotta's chatty , giggly , manner of teaching began to grate on my
nerves. There are far better DVDs out there .",1220140800,2,193,4.388888888888889
8198709,5,B000R3PDCK,Didn't realize this was John (j peterman tv's seinfeld) and charlote the REAL Dancing with the Stars TV show winners the other season.  Really enjoyed it and was easy and funny to learn from.  Hope they come out with another.,1186358400,7,225,4.6
