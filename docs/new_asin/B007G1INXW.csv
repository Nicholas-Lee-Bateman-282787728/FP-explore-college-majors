8516153,5,B007G1INXW,"There are two versions of this story. A 1989 original Japanese version with Ayako Kawahara as Mikage. Then there is the 1997 Hong Kong version with Yasuko Tomita as Aggie (aka Mikage), an attractive young adult female who lost her parents when young then loses her caretaker grandmother and then closes within herself, such as not speaking, to the world. She is taken in by a friend of grandmama, a transgender woman with a young adult hip son. That sub story is in itself an interesting and moving part of the film. Aggie seems to have a better than average sense of smell which, as we discover, makes her a tour-de-force in the kitchen.

A creatively written and well acted self discovery plot with a potential touch of romance and many unpredictable twists. English subtitles were accurate, but a bit weird in giving our characters English names.",1440201600,,849,4.775510204081633
