3102178,4,B00134YQNO,"Other reviews have done a great job of supplying the content in each of these Gay/Straight Relationships short films. Three of the 4 are real good and if you relate, will bring up some emotion. One of them, Katydid, just plain stunk.",1229817600,5,233,4.571428571428571
3102179,5,B00134YQNO,"All short film collections are a mixed bag.  Of this collection, ""Katydid"" was almost unwatchable for me.  The other movies are wonderful.  ""Cowboy Forever"" is one of the best gay male short films of all time.  Govinda Machado de Figueiredo, the actor on the left on the cover of the DVD, is one of the most beautiful actors I've ever seen.  He is wonderful in this movie.  This film is subtle, sexy and moving.  And sexy.  ""The Best Men"" is also a lovely, beautiful short film.",1220140800,13,478,4.476744186046512
3102180,4,B00134YQNO,"The dynamics of straight/gay relationships is the underlying theme of the four short films featured in ""Not Gay"", a new compilation DVD from Strand Releasing.  As usual, I choose the overall rating based on an average of the individual films included.

""The Best Men"" (2006) is a film I can personally relate to, as I was the best man at the wedding of a friend whom I realized I had a crush on for many years.  Peter, the best man in this case, and he gets some surprise consolation from the groom's mother and sister. 4 stars out of 5.

""Katydid"" (2004) is a very brief but potentially interesting comedy about a teen who thinks his twin brother goes out of his way to steal his girlfriend and friends away from him.  His confusion takes on a whole new dimension when he discovers said brother kissing a male neighbor.  The actors fell short on this one, in my opinion.  3 stars out of 5.

""Float"" (2007) is a beautifully-photographed short about self-esteem, love, and playing the hand that one is dealt in life.  Johnny is an obsessive-compulsive but talented young gay painter in the Bahamas is encouraged to spend some time on another island, where he meets the charasmatic Romeo, who succeeds in drawing him out of his shell a bit.  Later, Johnny gets to return the favor.  4 stars out of 5.

When I saw the premise of ""Cowboy Forever"" (France 2006), I thought we were in for a Brazilian remake of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" but it was much more than that.  This quasi-documentary tells the story of a somewhat shy Brazilian gaucho (cowboy), and his growing friendship/infatuation with a co-worker.  Beautifully executed and photographed, including a peek into GLBT life in that country, I give it 5 stars out of 5.",1209513600,7,1717,4.642384105960265
3102181,3,B00134YQNO,"Usually, in these ""shorts collections,"" we romantics out here find the well to be pretty much dry---if you know what I mean (I've tossed any number of such past DVDs).  In this collection, however, we are given at least a couple of films with ""romantic merit"" (one stunningly so.......but notice I didn't say 'happily' so).

In ""The Best Men"" we are given a memorable tale when introduced to a Best Man whose feelings of longing and impending loss are so palpable, so raw, they slam into us.  Then we meet the Groom and begin to learn the reason for those feelings.  It becomes obvious that what we have here are friends from childhood---no, it's more than that; in their own way they've evolved into partners of a sort.  As layers quickly open, we become aware of a ""closeness"" which, at some point in the past, most likely even included bodies shared.  We then see other examples of the extreme ease that exists between the two.......one of which includes a gifting, which we watch, of an admired ring (very much appearing to be a wedding-type band......noticeably winding up on a left hand ring finger).  We, then, really begin to wonder just what has and is happening here.  At this work's conclusion, though, we have to bring ourselves to accept that, for whatever reasons, one of our leads has chosen to embark upon a course that is, not just expected, but demanded by society.  We've come to realize that, in the sweet memories this groom is stirring up and in the physical gestures he is freely bestowing, he has become the cruelest sort of life drop-out.  All said and done, though, it's a beautifully presented story:  truly powerfully acted by Michael Ellison and directed by Tony Wei

""Float"" gives us another well done and competantly acted tale in a romantic mood, this time leaving us with hope that things can turn out well........that love can prevail.  ""Cowboy Forever"" also leaves romantics among us with a pleasant aftertaste.  However, because of the somewhat differing sensibilities involved with the foreign background making up this story---and our being given lessons in a way of life somewhat new to us---it takes us a bit longer to reach our happy ending.

""Katydid"" is this collection's final story, which some may consider comical, though it makes this romance seeking viewer wonder why money and time were ever squandered in filming this annoying production---one containing two most unpleasant leads.

8249223,4,B00134YQNO,Very nice and entertaining shorts. Even better with subtitles.,1420416000,,62,6.0
8249224,3,B00134YQNO,Fair,1411344000,,4,4.0
8249225,3,B00134YQNO,This movie was a bit slow but entertaining.,1407888000,,43,4.5
8249226,2,B00134YQNO,"to be honest, these 'shorts' were so vapid, that i forgot most of what they were all about!!  The two that I remember any of the storyline is the Best Man and Cowboy.  Both deal with unrequited love between a gay guy and a str8 one! Why is it that in any gay film where the antagonists are gay and str8, the gay guy comes out holding the short end of the stick? It seems our affliction in being gay must always end in tragedy, loss or suffering, its as if being gay, we are predestined to suffer for our 'sin!' I know these films are designed to 'tell our story' but come on, filmdom, do us a favor and show us riding off in the sunset with our str8 lover riding sidesaddle (ha).",1394668800,,679,4.059701492537314
8249227,4,B00134YQNO,it's a cute film of shorts. all of the clips or films are different. the groomsmen was my favorite which I wish was an hour long. And yes folks its the exact one that didn't have sound. This 1 does.,1384387200,,198,3.975
8249228,3,B00134YQNO,"There is really only one exceptional film - Cowboy Forever. I never finished Katydid - too grating. The Best Men is a sketch, although well done. And Float has some nice imagery, but also is very simple.",1377129600,,203,4.513513513513513
8249229,2,B00134YQNO,This was ok to watch.. Seen it before. I enjoyed the story line.  Looking forward to another episode when available.,1364774400,,116,4.8
8249230,3,B00134YQNO,"Katydid is a disaster. Horrid acting, unbelievably poor writing, embarrassing production aesthetics. It features the well worn gimmick of one actor playing two brothers. You literally get a double dose of the guy. It's not a good thing. Best Man is pretty good. The dialog is a little contrived and relies on cliches, like the straight lovelorn sister wistfully saying, ""All the best men are gay."" Get it?  Ha Ha.

The two films in this collection worth watching are Float and Cowboy Forever. Float is a bit predictable, but tells an interesting story. Cowboy Forever is well written, acted and filmed. It's definitely the prize winner in this package.",1363737600,,652,4.972477064220183
8249231,5,B00134YQNO,"What a lovely, simple and elegant short film.  The emotions are direct and honest and it has a feeling of truth.",1344124800,,112,4.333333333333333
8249232,1,B00134YQNO,"Save your money! totally tame, dull and uninteresting, just a few stories that really are pretty lame.  Could have done with a big fat injection of of excitement, kissing or event a hint of sex??",1327881600,,195,4.571428571428571
