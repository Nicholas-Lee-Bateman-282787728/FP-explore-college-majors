8423297,2,B004CNK5BK,"Good quality transfers of this old western TV show. This DVD contains three episodes (""Chippewa Indians"", ""Ghost Bushwacker"", and ""Safe Crackers"") that I haven't seen bundled together in the big western TV DVD megapack sets, so that's definitely a plus, as I'm trying to watch the whole series. Definitely a fun show and one of my favorites.

Well, once again Alpha Video proves it's an organization dedicated to poor quality control. The episode ""Ghost Bushwacker(s)"" is NOT included on this DVD, but instead ""Center Fire"" and ""Spring the Trap"", available on numerous other DVDs fill out what was a promising disc. I don't mind paying the price of a DVD for three out of four unseen episodes, but when you can't even label your bloody DVDs properly...well, a 5-star review becomes 2-stars in the blink of an eye.",1470960000,,813,4.891304347826087
