8286039,5,B001C4ZQFW,"This is a little better than volume 7. The heroes find themselves in a world where the Queen seems to stir something in Fai's past. He apparently has had a relationship with this girl in another world; and here I was thinking he was gay. Anyway, after they leave that world they arrive in one where a group of monks are at war with a traveling female circus. A time warp sucks the heroes back and they are drawn into the middle of a war to control a moon castle. They soon learn something shocking about the 2 sides, and their past. There may or may not be a feather in store for them this time.",1355097600,,595,4.137931034482759
8286040,5,B001C4ZQFW,I have watched now 7 of the Tsubasa DVD series from Clamp and I must say all have been great. But The Vol 8 was the most amusing with the very first episode having our heroes enter a world of old fashioned animation. With Mokona being in control of both the world created and our brave heroes.  I have been thrilled with this series and the characters have become fast familiar to me.  Great series to share with others too.,1234915200,,424,4.2875
