7842973,5,6303250505,Children of all ages love this video. The repetition and teaching of the repeating words/phrases have the children soon joining in and not only singing along but signing as well. Ken Lonnquist has a keen ear and sensitivity to topics that interest children everywhere. The use of singers from all backgrounds as well as different instruments engages the viewer as well. I highly recommend this one particularly for ages 7-10.,1172016000,,425,5.085714285714285
