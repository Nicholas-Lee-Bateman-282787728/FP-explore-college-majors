I especially appreciate this classic series of All-Time Favorite Homecoming Songs and Performances. Volume 3 has many of my personal favorite songs, performances, and artists included.

Some of the numbers I especially enjoy are: Thank You featuring Ray Boltz, The Wonder of it all as sung by Doug Oldham, Loving God, Loving Each Other, featuring Guy Penrod with the Vocal Band, and Why Me? featuring Bob Cain.

Other highlights include: Kim Hopper and David Phelps featured singing I'll Fly Away, Jake Hess and Gloria Gaither singing Sunday Meeting Time, and Stephen Hill singing Lead Me to That Rock.

Bill Gaither's narrations introducing the artists and numbers exhibit a sincere apprication of the music and the artis and keep the program moving.

Another inspirational performance honoring Christ the central theme of every song.",1308528000,2,1047,5.099415204678363
