2011775,5,B0001LJCI4,"Any reliable biographical account has an obligation to relate the relevant and significant facts of the `LIFE' studied without such facts being manipulated. It is not only necessary to precisely articulate the facts as they were in the life of such a person but also to meticulously place them in light of the circumstances that prevailed then. This very well researched documentary does a good job at complying with both these factors. Unlike today, at the time the Buddha lived, there wasn't a practice to document the lives of celebrities. So most of what we know about Buddha today is through widely prevalent Buddhist folklore in the regions where Buddhism is ubiquitous, the biographical accounts of Buddha as they appear in some of the oldest Buddhist manuscripts, and some intensely studied archeological remains like the stupas and the remains of the city of Nalanda which justify the authenticity of such ages-old Buddha stories. Based on these resources, this documentary carefully takes you on an educational journey depicting the life of `The Enlightened One' while avoiding exaggerations of any kind.",1129680000,58,1114,5.229050279329609
2011776,5,B0001LJCI4,"If you're new to Buddhism or would like to know more, this is probably the best place to start.  I've only been following the Buddhist lifestyle for a few years and I found this film to be very helpful.  Sometimes the books can be a little dry and some of the names and places are very difficult to pronounce, that's another reason why this is a really great film.  So much information is given in the 90 minute video but if you want a Buddhism 101, I highly recommend it.  Even if you're not a Buddhist, it's a beautiful story.",1107734400,60,528,4.25
8013977,5,B0001LJCI4,"I have read several books with different views of the life of Buddha; what comes to mind is the version displayed in the movie Little Buddha (1999) with Keanu Reeves.

This presentation was much more complete and realistic with added archeological finds and well informed presenters.

The presentation is coherent and fills in many gaps in the life of Buddha.

This DVD comes in three language choices (English, French, or German) and even though it offered closed caption does not really come through.

Some of the presentation is by the author, Thich Nhat Hanh. a Vietnamese monk, a renowned Zen master,",1494547200,,605,4.96039603960396

8013979,5,B0001LJCI4,"An ingenious combination of  lavish action film and dharmic teachings.  But the best part was the ""Special Features"" with its archeological explanations of the historical Buddha's origins and Thich  Nhat Hanh's succinct explanation of the basic teachings.  Highly recommended for beginning seekers & jaded practitioners.",1396310400,,320,6.044444444444444
8013980,4,B0001LJCI4,"This is more documentary than entertainment.  If someone wants to have an historical/philosophical perspective, this is it, but it is also well done and nicely photographed.  I enjoyed it and then donated it to a Zen Center for teaching purposes.  If someone wants to be entertained and also learn about the historical Buddha and his philosophy, then The Little Buddha with Keanu Reeve is a good choice.",1260576000,2,403,4.985074626865671
8013981,5,B0001LJCI4,I am a World Religions instructor at the university level and have greatly enjoyed using this video as part of my curriculum.  Beautifully filmed and narrated.  The filming on location made the life of Buddha more realistic and believable to those who have never traveled in India.,1245715200,3,281,4.957446808510638
8013982,4,B0001LJCI4,"Life of Buddha.
Documentary on the historical Buddha. Excellent commentary from traditional storytellers, archaeologist, historians and senior members of the Sangha. Visits the sacred/ historical places of Guru Shakyamuni's life. Superb.",1196035200,2,237,6.67741935483871
8013983,4,B0001LJCI4,"It starts with storytellers telling the tales of life of the Buddha and then goes into historical facts. Venturing into what life might have been like in that time period. Asking the question, was Siddharta reared in Shaman or other religious practices of the time? This biographical accounting of the Buddha was informative.

Makes me want to go to India and sit on Vultures Peek to meditate. I have watched it over and over.",1182902400,4,426,4.756756756756757
8013984,2,B0001LJCI4,It's a narrative. I thought it would be the life of Buddha as portrayed by actors. Kinda dry. The cover art is beautiful tho.,1173657600,2,125,4.25
8013985,4,B0001LJCI4,"This 90-minute documentary (with audio in English, French, or German) tells the traditional story of the life of the Buddha and intersperses information about the way of life in northern India at the time of the Buddha.

If you're new to Buddhism, you may find the film a little slow, with more detail than you really want. I think it will be more interesting to those who already know something about Buddhism. I learned details of the story of the Buddha that were new to me, and I enjoyed getting a better sense of how the Buddha might actually have lived. For many years, in teaching classes on Buddhism, I've shown pictures from the children's book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prince-Siddhartha/dp/0861713753/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prince Siddhartha</a>"" to illustrate the story of the Buddha, but now I show excerpts from this video instead or in addition.

The DVD's bonus features (50 minutes' worth) seem to be footage that didn't make it into the actual film. I found much of it pretty dull, but the extra interview material from Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh was a nice bonus. I especially liked his discussions of the Buddha, karma, and nirvana, and I use those in my teaching.",1168992000,14,1234,5.1959798994974875
8013986,4,B0001LJCI4,"You can learn a lot about Siddhartha Gautama, The Buddha, from this DVD.  However, the first half is a bit boring (I showed it to my high school students in a World Religions class and they dozed through the first 30 minutes!)  The second half is much better.  One major drawback is that a few of the experts who are interviewed in the program have such thick accents that they are very difficult to understand.  But, on the positive side, this program is beautifully filmed, showing many of the places where Siddhartha spent time during his life.  And, as far as I can tell, it is an accurate and detailed retelling of the events of his life.  I greatly enjoyed it and my students leanred a lot from it (once they woke up!)",1168560000,13,724,4.406015037593985
