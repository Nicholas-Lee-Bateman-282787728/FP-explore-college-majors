5088741,4,B007I60TJQ,"As a total beginner, I do like this video a lot.  I'd like to see the author include more slow-mo sections, because I am a slow learner.  I also would like to see the PDF file with more information.",1382659200,,198,4.051282051282051
5088742,5,B007I60TJQ,"The instruction on this video was well-planned and delivered. Best use of media I've come across in 30 years of teaching.

Great break-down of steps, easy learning curve. Motivational!

I'd recommend it for anyone interested in the brave new world of cajon, from beginners to experienced musicians looking for an update of their skills on this amazing box.

Thank you Mr. Dworsky for an excellent learning tool.",1377561600,9,411,5.104477611940299
5088743,5,B007I60TJQ,"This is an outstanding educational DVD whose emphasis is on ensuring that the viewer understands the material presented. I have been playing Latin percussion for over forty years and I have never seen a production of this quality and pedagogical effectiveness. The author even replays the set of hits on the Cajon in slow motion to augment clarity for the viewer. It is not by accident that Alan has won awards in the past - more are certainly forthcoming. I wish he would include material on the Peruvian cajon; but overall, excellent DVD - highly recommended.",1356912000,9,561,4.854166666666667
5088744,5,B007I60TJQ,"I recently picked up a cajon and was looking for a DVD that covered more modern grooves/rock patterns.

After much research I decided to purchase Cajon Grooves for Beginners. Alan Dworsky is the instructor and producer of the DVD. Al is a drum nerd who has come up with a very unique teaching style of being able to take complex grooves and comfortably break them down into understandable, easy to learn chunks.

He starts the DVD by covering basic cajon hand techniques. Next he takes you through the most simple grooves and progresses to more complex patterns. He keeps each lesson simple and understandable. He plays the grooves with you for several minutes so that you can follow along with him and learn the groove patterns, all the while clearly talking you through the hand patterns. This DVD is really like sitting down with him and taking a one-on-one lesson. He makes it easy to pick up the beats, as he gives you numerous tools to help you learn them, from playing the beats with you, to playing the beats in slow-motion and providing a jam session at the end of each new groove to help you jam along and get comfortable with the groove pattern.

This DVD is perfect for those that are just starting out on the cajon as well as for drummers like myself who have played for a long time, but want to apply a drum kit style of playing to the cajon.  The DVD is professionally produced, chaptered and chock full of great grooves. There is even a PDF on the DVD that has all the grooves he teaches you written out in cajon sheet music.

In all honesty this DVD will get anyone up and jamming on the cajon in no time flat, no joke, in minutes even. I will use this DVD over and over again, as there is a wealth of information and beats on it, from jazz, rock, swing, to keep me learning and grooving for a long time.",1345507200,24,1821,4.375739644970414
5088745,5,B007I60TJQ,"The instruction presentation is superb. This DVD would be great for non-drummers. I am an experienced drummer, but new to cajon and unfortunately, I didn't learn a lick or anything satisfying from this entry level DVD on the subject. I went back to the ad and everything is as advertised- for beginners. I think what threw me were the review testimonials stating good for beginners ""and"" experienced drummers. I thought there would be soloing rhythm patterns that could be built on. The instruction is simply tapping out drum set patterns/beats on a cajon. This is the same thing drummers do on the car dashboard at red lights. I guess this is good for a total beginner who's goal might be to able to tap along with a song on a cajon? I would not, could not, recommend this instruction for drummers even with minimal set playing experience. It is very, very, basic, but done very well!",1470614400,,885,4.67948717948718

5088747,5,B007I60TJQ,"A true beginners DVD. Good slo-mo and top and side angles. I also have Getting Started On Cajon by Michael Wimberly...it would be good if I had a few years of drumming experience and could read music.

5088754,4,B007I60TJQ,I have the DVD lesson for the Bongo. I would give this a 5 star but the play along lessons are not as easy to get to as in his Bongo lessons DVD. Besides that it is great. Easy to learn. Patterns you can use right now. His teaching style is great.,1388188800,,247,3.769230769230769
