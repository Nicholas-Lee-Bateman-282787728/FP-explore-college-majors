8241453,4,B0011E2TQ2,"Not knowing much about Machu Picchu, I saw someone's travel photos and was entranced. This DVD provided me with a great introduction to the history of the city built at the top of the world. Like most History channel documentaries, it is thorough, photographically stunning, and interesting. Glad I got it, and I plan to watch it again before the trip we will someday take to visit.",1248566400,7,382,4.7164179104477615
8241454,5,B0011E2TQ2,"This is a fascinating film, possibly solving the mystery of this city, such as why it is there and what happened. The theories here may be surprising to some who have heard other stories of this place. Beautifully photographed and well narrated and a wonderful story all make this a very good buy.",1236643200,10,297,4.622641509433962
