Your baby is only used as a weight or just rests on you while you exercise. This would be good for a young baby who needs to be entertained and doesn't mind being moved about and just sitting. My baby is 5 1/2 months and wouldn't sit still for it.

The second video is a gentle stretching program you can do for your small baby. The baby is passive throughout. My baby didn't care for most of it, but did like watching the video. Even though we didn't do much of it we did a little of each and afterwards I could feel her muscles were putting off a little heat and she felt like she'd just eaercised (felt a little more energized and toned), so I'd say that one was good for us, but because she is getting pretty mobile she didn't really want to stay still for it. Perhaps she will get used to it if we continue every day.

Overall, it was ok, but really only fully useful to a select number of people.",1140480000,,1049,4.137254901960785

In the morning, baby and I did the aerobics portion of the tape.  While this routine is not going to cut it for the real athletes in the crowd, it did improve my figure and made me feel better about myself.  And my daughter found the movements very soothing and would often drift off to sleep.
The stretching exercizes were heavenly and really helped relax my aching new-mommy back and neck.  My baby got a kick out of some of the floor exercizes and enjoyed watching the images of the babies on the screen during the moves she did not participate.
Often in the evenings, we'd do the infant massage portion of the tape.  We both enjoyed that.  It was great for cooing and bonding.
This tape can only be used with babies who are not yet mobile, but I feel I absolutely got my money's worth in the few months we were able to use it.",986860800,15,970,4.3076923076923075
7919209,3,B00003L9AQ,"The main thing to remember if interested in this video that your baby must be completely immobile. My ten month old would not sit still for even the first stretch. In order for this tape to be successfully used, your baby  must be still on its back and not moving around all the time, maybe 1 to 5  months? Otherwise, it might be a cool tape, I just couldn't use it.",949363200,70,366,4.140845070422535
