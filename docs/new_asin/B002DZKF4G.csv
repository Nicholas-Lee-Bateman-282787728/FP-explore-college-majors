8366552,2,B002DZKF4G,"La Sangre Enemiga(1971) is a drab, violent, sexy, depressing drama based on a novel by Luis Spota. Leading lady Mercedes Carreno spends 55% of the film nude! David Reynoso and Emilio ""El Indio"" Fernandez co-star. Carreno plays Sara, an orphaned girl who ends up living with circus performers. The characters in the story are flawed and victims of their own impulses.
Veteran director Rogelio A. Gonzalez does a good job directing the film. If you're a die hard Meche Carreno fan, see this film. If you want something fun and light, avoid it!",1366243200,,541,4.827956989247312
