These movies the better 1's of the trilogy were available individually by Walmart as part of their exclusive blu-ray line. They r now available together @ a fantastic low price!

So fans of Chuck Norris, the time 2 act is now, go 4 it!!!",1423526400,3,464,4.523809523809524
6599146,5,B00MP2FI4O,"Missing in Action - Chuck Norris is very different in this film. He is very serious and he acts very good. The other actors are good in the film as well. The action is just non-stop. The action is quite rough and action like this isn't seen often in movies especially in this day and age in My opinion. There are many other great scenes of Norris fighting shooting up the bad guys!

Missing in Action 2 - Although many people will disagree with me, I enjoy watching this movie. While the acting may not be top-notch, the plot and setting give the impression that you are actually a member of a POW camp and must struggle along with Colonel Braddock (Chuck Norris) to escape. Following Braddock's plight as a prisoner, the death of his comrades, and his final showdown with Colonel Yin, the movie nicely builds up to its climax and leaves the viewer with a sense of finality that many movies tend to lack in their endings.",1420156800,3,921,4.449704142011834

8673781,3,B00MP2FI4O,Only MIA1 is wide-screen MIA2 is standard.  I wanted to return them but technically it does say multi-format.  It really should indicate that THEIR definition of multi'format is that one movie is one format and the other movie is a different format.  I'don't suggest making a pass on this one and buy the movies individually if you want widescreen - meaning BOTH movies in widescreen.,1489190400,,384,4.876923076923077

8673787,1,B00MP2FI4O,"I Doubt these 2 classic Chuck norris films Missing in Action 1 & 2 will ever get any special treatment on blu-ray
so Chuck norris fans like myself will just have to accept the fact, MGM/20th century fox don't give a Damn
all they want is to make more money even if the blu-ray re-issues are barebones treatment's it does not matter
it's tragic, it's like going to a funeral
the very old DVD versions of both MIA films only had Dolby digital mono sound mix and the extras were just usual Theatrical trailers
i bought this new 2 disc blu-ray re-issue thinking the picture quality would be excellent & the sound quality would be new 5.1 mixes
man was i wrong here's what i observed
of course both films are presented in new HD widescreen transfers 1:85:1 ratio
so the picture quality actually does look pretty Good better than the very old dvd versions anyway
i cannot say the same for the Audio quality, it's terrible it's an insult
the sound quality is the same as the old dvd releases, just a Mono sound mix that's it
MGM made no effort with the sound quality what else is new
pretty Disgusting effort don't you think, i think a 5.1 Master audio mix option should've been added for sure
but of course MGM couldn't be bothered making extra effort
and of course no new extras, eg a new retrospective featurette with Director Joseph zito or Lance Hool who Directed the sequel
or maybe a new Audio commentary by Director Joseph Zito or Director Lance Hool
so all you get is the usual Theatrical trailer from the old dvd versions
unless however an independent Distributor like shout factory get the rights to both films
then you would definitely get some new extras, a new Audio commentary by Director Joseph zito at least
you would get some new extras anyway and possibly new 5.1 mix if shoud factory gained the copyrights to the films
what a waste 2 of the films can easily be put on 1 blu-ray disc
the first blu-ray versions of both MIA films were released seperatly with their own blu-ray cases & artwork
so this new re-issue has both Discs in 1 blu-ray case with cover art
only Difference is the packaging
amazon.com are selling each MIA blu-ray at $10 each or get this new 2 Disc case for only $10 anyway, $5 each Disc
or just keep the old dvd versions if you don't think it's worth some money buying the blu-ray versions
4 stars for both films, 1 star for this new blu-ray",1435190400,,2374,4.434782608695652
8673788,2,B00MP2FI4O,"I don't expect chuck's movie's to be masterpieces just thrilling. The plot in these two films was very poor, not believable as was the the actors",1433116800,,145,4.615384615384615
