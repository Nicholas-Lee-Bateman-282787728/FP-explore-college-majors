8351125,5,B0025GB7U4,"Somehow I feel this six-part drama series from ITV in 2008 just slightly missed the mark.  The premise of a covert, and therefore deniable, hit team working for the police is promising; and the individual stories were different enough to be quite interesting.  Excellent actor though he is, I had problems believing Andrew Buchan (Broadchurch, Garrow's Law) was such a cold-blooded killer.  As expected, Tamzin Outhwaite (Spooks, New Tricks) plays the hard woman very well.  There are subtitles and a 'play all' option.  All said, this season one and the following season two are certainly worth the time and money.",1438473600,,615,5.11

John Mercer made a deal w/Lenny (his handler to be) securing an early release from jail to be an assassin for a shadowy government organization.  He is summarily dumped in a housing estate apartment (UK equivalent of subsided housing in the US AKA ""projects"") with an side kick Calum, who while not a killer, has some criminal skills and was apparently made a similar type of offer.  The side kick also provides some comic relief in what for the most part is a serious show.  Then there is Rose, slightly older, works with Lenny and was romantically involved at some point in the past.  As the storyline develops John starts to question what he is being asked to do while there is mounting sexual tension with Rose.

I really did enjoy this show and most definitely could have stood another series.",1335916800,,1000,4.486187845303867
8351127,5,B0025GB7U4,"I loved this series about a 'Dexter' like assassin. The John Mercer character is fascinating. A good man basically, with a troubled childhood in fostercare after his partents died in car accident during which he tried to shield his sister from the cries of their dying mother by singing to her. He went into the army (special forces) and shot the aunt and uncle who raised his sister because the uncle abused his sister and the aunt did nothing to stop him. He's sentenced for this but is released early by Douglas in return for becoming a state sanctioned killer for some secret government unit.

Although John Mercer is blackmailed by Douglas into killing for the state he finds out he likes to kill (bad)people and he has to come to terms with that feeling. The love for his sister and her two kids helps him to stay human and his sister is the only person he shows his feelings to. Although his sidekick Calumn (a delightful character who brings humor to the series) annoys him terribly sometimes he also makes him laugh and brings out his protective streak. Although she deceived him and lied to him he's starting to have feelings for Rose (and she for him) and the fact that she sleeps with other man in the line of duty makes him jealous and, in one episode, leads to an unordered kill....Unfortunately season 2 (even better) ends with a cliffhanger and there won't be a season three:

I think it's the kind of series the Americans could make a nice (maybe even better) remake of.",1289779200,,1493,4.567164179104478
