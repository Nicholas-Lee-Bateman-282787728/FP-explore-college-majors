8070569,4,B0009YV3ZS,"Great movie for an old 70s flick, but don't buy a Doberman because of it. They are dogs that require TONS of activity and exercise. They are very high energy dogs and not suitable for everyone. They are also VERY strong willed and will try to get their way most of the time.",1473465600,,274,4.188679245283019

8070571,2,B0009YV3ZS,"""The doggonist gang that the world had ever seen...""

At dinner one night, my father-in-law saw a Doberman on TV and asked if I had ever seen the movie where Dobermans rob a bank. I hadn't...but knew from that description alone that I had to track it down.

It was released in 1972, directed by Byron Chudnow. Chudnow only directed four movies in his career...The Doberman Gang, The Daring Dobermans, The Amazing Dobermans, and Alex and the Doberman Gang. Pretty safe to say that this guy had an unhealthy obsession with these dogs. It stars TV journeyman actor Byron Mabe, Hal Reed and Julie Parrish, none of whom you've ever heard of.

The story revolves around an ex-con named Eddie and his desire to rob a bank without the element of 'human error' once a bank job goes wrong. To do this, he and a dog trainer snag a pack of Dobermans and train them to rob a bank using whistles. Sound crazy? It is. It really is.

The premise of this movie sounds a bit better than it actually is. What we actually get is about 10 minutes of set up, an hour of dog training, and a ten minute heist. A bunch of character decisions make no sense, none more than the fact that Eddie is about the least careful criminal one could be. He pulls a waitress that he's known for one night into the job because...well...sex, and when the dog trainer threatens to bolt, he basically lets him. He flat out deserves to get caught. At least the 70's music is 'groovy', featuring a song about the dogs that just classic(ly bad).

I cannot recommend seeing The Doberman Gang. The only thing redeeming about this thing is the music and watching a bulldog try to run the doberman course.",1421712000,,1656,4.452145214521452

8070573,3,B0009YV3ZS,"The Doberman Gang was a silly yet fun and original film, that became a cult classic because above all is cool, entertaining and unpretencious, therefore it doesn't matter if it is believable or not, it's a movie and evrything can happen whithin a movie, as long as it is truthful to the characters and the plot and this one is. A 70's classic!.",1247702400,,344,4.476190476190476
8070574,5,B0009YV3ZS,"I throughly enjoyed this movie.  This shows how intelligent dobermans are!!  Anyone who loves dobies will love this film.  In this film, 6 doberman's are trained to rob banks.  The dobies carry out this mission successfully, with sheer intelligence.

The ending is surprising, so I won't reveal that, but see this movie, if you are a true dobie lover.

I liked the names of the dobies in this movie, i.e.  Ma Barker, Bonnie, Clyde, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson and Dillenger.

A very entertaining movie!",1219708800,3,509,4.837209302325581
8070575,5,B0009YV3ZS,"Watching this movie after soooo many years brought back fond memories. I experienced the same warmth and excitment seeing it again as I did when it was first shown on t.v.!! It is worth the price. I am well pleased with the quality and sound of the movie. This is a true classic.  Can't wait to show it to the rest of my family and friends to enjoy.  It is one of the very few videos that children can watch,too! I was not too pleased with the delayed delivery but the seller did respond to my concerns immediately and I received my order soon after!  Hence, the 5 star rating!.  Thank you!",1137888000,,590,4.241071428571429
