7857422,5,6303944116,"I SAW IT WHEN I WAS ABOUT 15, LIVING IN AN ORPHANAGE. I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. I COULD NEVER FIND A COPY, BEEN SEARCHING FOREVER. SO HAPPY TO FIND ONE NOW. FUNNY PARTS, SAD PARTS, HAPPY PARTS, ANGRY PARTS, THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF HUMAN EMOTION. MAKES FOR GREAT ENTERTAINMENT. VERY FEW MOVIES DURRING THIS PERIOD OF TIME WERE AS FULFILLING. DID NOT CARE IF REAVES OR  D ALBO WAS IN IT OR NOT STORY LINE WAS GREAT. LOVED THE ENDING "" LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE WON ""  answer  "" NO, I JUST GOT MY ASS ACROSS THE FALLS "".  {NIAGRA FALLS}  ALBO'S CHARACTER WAS SO SWEET AND STRONG. REEVES WAS GEEKY BUT SO KEANUE. I NEVER EVEN KNEW IT WAS HIM AT THE TIME. ANYHOW I'LL BE ESTATIC WHEN I GET MY NEW COPY.",1143763200,,686,4.08955223880597
