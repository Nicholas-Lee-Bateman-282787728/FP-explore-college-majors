The sites, interviews and location of his birth and ministry was a good introduction and the only I found. It is a good beginning into learning about this great young saint. Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Lord for your work and faith. I was inspired.",1453593600,,329,4.593220338983051

7799322,1,1580025013,"The life of Pier Giorgio Frassati is interesting and very compelling.  Unfortunately, his story was very poorly told by the Lords.  The story of a young man cannot be told by most elderly people.  The Lords tended to insert too much of their understanding and admiration of him instead of simply letting his story be told by the events of his life.  I found their commentary tedious.

I downloaded this video in the hopes of showing it to my son, but will not do so.  I will continue to search for a rendition of the life of Pier Giorgio that is worthy of him.",1360454400,2,560,4.336538461538462
7799323,5,1580025013,"This is a truly interesting and moving story about a young man's short journey in life.  A person interested in making a difference.  While I think the Bob and Penny team should have let his niece speak more and they less, you learn much about his life and you learn how to live by it.",1255305600,,285,4.163636363636364
