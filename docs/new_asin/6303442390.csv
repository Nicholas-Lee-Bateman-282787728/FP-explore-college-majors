644470,4,6303442390,"A funny retelling of the Jules Verne classic with the boys as the servent of the great grandson of the origonal around the world adventurer.
The boys are good better than the writing and the supporting villian is an interesting character.
A clean fun family film. Best scene is in read China as the Communists try to brainwash the stooges. A hopeless task.",1056931200,,356,4.666666666666667

644472,4,6303442390,"THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE (1963) is a great Three Stooges movie. It's a spoof of the classic Jules Verne story AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. The stooges are servants to Phileas Fogg's great-grandson, who plans to redo the classic trip around the world. This is a great movie, and it's fun to see the world. Emil Sitka stars as a butler for about 5 seconds.

644473,4,6303442390,"In This Spoof of Jules Verne's adventure films. Moe ,Larry & ""Curly Joe"":De Rita travel with the Great Grandson of ""Phinease Fogg I""Around the world in 80 days Without paying for their trip. The gobal trek is being done. So that ""Mr. Phinease Fogg III""(Played here with some twitty apolmb by Jay Sheffield) can win a bet for $40,000 pounds from the Great Grandson of ""Randolph Stuart III"".Supposedly .Mr. Stuart's grandfather had bet against the first ""Fogg's Gobal Trek""and lost..due to some reputedly unothidox methiods used by Sheffield's grandfather to win.""Stuart""manipulates ""Mr. Fogg""to go around the world..Without spending a farthing. The Boys go along with their boss to show him the methiods that ""The Three Stooges""have picked up as ""Born Chissilers"".What ""Mr. Fogg"",Moe Larry & ""Curly Joe""are unaware of is that""Randolph Stuart III""is really""Vickers Cavendish""a feeling conman and bank robber. Who is tricking ""Mr. Fogg""into creating a phoney gobal trek. Having the young fool sign a phoney document at ""The Regentcy St. Bank"".While ""Cavendish""steals the bank's currantcey shipment of $55,000 pounds.""Fogg""is framed for bank robbery and While ""Fogg"",""The Stooges""and a beautiful young lady:""Amelia Carter""(played by Joan Freeman)try to finish their trip. They are pursued by ""Vickers Cavendish""(Pete Forester)and his henchman:""Flitch""(Walt Burke).Who try to make sure that ""Mr. Fogg""never returns to London alive to testify against them. And to complicate matters. Scotland Yard's top Police Detective""Inspt. Crotchet""(Maurice Dallimore)tails the troup to bring ""Mr. Fogg"",""The Stooges And ""Ms. Carter""to Justice. The film has some laughs as The Stooges revive their ""Maha""Routine and ""The Pop Goes The Weasel""Bit that sends ""Curly Joe""Into a fighting rage that helps our heroes escape a Vendictive Maha and win a Sumo Wrestiling Match in San Fransisco,Cal. But The Scene where the boys finally help ""Inspt. Crotchet"",""Mr. Fogg""and ""Ms. Carter""Foil""Mr. Cavendish""and ""Flitch""with the ""Fighting in The Dark""Bit goes on too long. And The Race to get Their boss back To ""The Reformer's Club""to win the bet. Becomes a tired slapstick chase that only has mild laughs. The Stooges try to spoof Jules Verne. But It's not an easy parody..It's too bad that they didn;t get a chance to spoof ""20,Thousand Leagues Under The Sea!"".With Emil Sitka as ""Prof. Arronax"",and possibly Jimmy Darren as ""Ned Land""and Their old neimsis:Gene Roth as ""Capt. Nemo""? Well? One can only dream of what ""The Three Stooges""Could have done back them.",1009411200,,2533,5.530927835051546

7846768,4,6303442390,"While I'm not wildly enthusiastic about the Joe Derita features, this is a good, solid movie. Don't go in expecting anything close to the masterpieces turned out during the stooges heyday making the short subjects with Curly and Shemp, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

The movie starts off well in the opening with the boys preparing Mr. Fogg's breakfast and some of the reused routines like ""pop goes the weasel"" and the ""maharajah"" routine are pulled off well in this feature. I especially enjoyed Curly-Joe's sumo wrestling rematch with the mighty Itchy-Kitchy.

Overall, a pleasant 90 or so minutes and the best of the Stooges 1959-1960s features.",1358035200,,665,5.036363636363636
7846769,3,6303442390,"There haven't been many completely successful (in the artistic sense) feature length slapstick or broad comedies starring legendary comics such as the Three Stooges, and here's another one which should have been much funnier - opportunities fall by the wayside as the director, writer, and editor seem to forget what makes this kind of humor work - it's got to move fast, there's got to be quotable funny lines, etc.
In all fairness, you could count on two hands the collective feature-length *classics* by Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, and others. Jerry Lewis has two classics (""The Errand Boy"" and ""The Nutty Professor"") but the point is that 100+ minutes is too long for this genre.
This film is definitely one of their best, however; the story, based upon Jules Verne's Around The World In 80 Days, and, in a way, foreshadowing ""Smokey And The Bandit"" - don't look at me like that! - has a nice flow, and the supporting actors are fine. Joan Freeman is an exotic beauty who also did a good job on Elvis Presley's ""Roustabout"", not long after this entry.
But if you're looking at this movie critically (by the way, it runs too long and should have been shot in color) then perhaps you're in the wrong spirit: it was wonderful that older comedians were finally making a few bucks and getting some long overdue attention. And more significantly, their timing and ad-lib talent was intact.",1182643200,3,1396,4.748971193415638
