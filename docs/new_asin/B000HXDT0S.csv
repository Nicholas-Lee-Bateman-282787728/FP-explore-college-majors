Great movie, good play from the actors. I strongly recommend it for boys under 10 of age.",1190851200,,262,3.6964285714285716

2648945,5,B000HXDT0S,"""First, this DVD is only in French. When I posed this question to Amazon, they did not care to answer. Therefore, I am stuck with 2 DVDs that only I understand. Amazon does not have a feedabck mechanism to contact them by e-mail. If they do have one, it must be hidden someplace in its maze-like website.""

Back to the movie, it is great entertainment for the kids despite being in French.",1175126400,19,389,4.402777777777778

8142544,5,B000HXDT0S,"This relatively little known French live action film from 1961 was the first time that Tintin (the famous boy reporter created by Belgian cartoonist Herge) was brought to the silver screen. It is also probably the best, certainly capturing better Tintins spirit than the recent Spielberg film. It obviously helped that Herge has creative input in this, unlike with other movies based on Tintin (though this was not based on any particular book but was rather an original story for the screen). The story has Captain Haddock unexpectedly inheriting a boat in Istanbul. When he goes there with Tintin to retrieve the boat, not only it turns out to be a rotting barge, but also there are a lot of baddies trying to pursue them and the boat. It soon becomes clear that the boat is involved with some treasure.  Jean Pierre Talbot and Georges Wilson are perfect as Tintin and Haddock. And the attractive locations (Istanbul, Athens, Meteora in Greece) filmed with lush color certainly help a lot.",1396396800,,991,4.863905325443787

8142546,3,B000HXDT0S,I do not speak French. The hope was that this version would at least have English captions. As a movie it works well though.,1378166400,,124,4.208333333333333

8142548,5,B000HXDT0S,"This and the Land of Blue Oranges are rare Tintin movies from the 1960s, made using real actors with the full blessing of the then live Herge. I had known about it for a while, and have seen clips in French on YouTube, but was unable to find a copy, much less one with English subtitles.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this version floating around (thanks Australia), and luckily I have an all-region PAL/NTSC DVD player.

The movie itself is refreshing and enjoyable.  The story is a new story created just for the movie.  It does not correspond to any of the Tintin books, though you could see many tricks and elements from the books in here.  I actually prefer that over the director taking liberties with the books I love.

It is so refreshing to see a Tintin movie acted by real people in a real setting.  The scenery is beautiful and the music just lovely.  I cannot believe how much the actors are made to look like Tintin characters.  Yes Haddock's beard looks like a fake, and the Thom(p)sons are a bit skinnier than I imagined, but those are real actors acting the part of cartoon characters.  Believe me, it is so much better than watching 3-D animated endless action sequences that leave your eyes sore and head spinning (take that Spielberg).  This is the real Tintin.  It felt like reading a brand new Tintin book!

Highly recommended.  I will probably buy several copies to give to my nephews and nieces.",1354147200,3,1424,4.55511811023622
8142549,2,B000HXDT0S,"Tintin and the Mystery of the Golden Fleece (Jean-Jacques Vierne, 1961)

There have been a number of attempts to bring Tintin tot he big screen (and the small) over the years, both in animated and live-action form; they have met with varying degrees of success. Vierne's 1961 attempt is interesting in that it is a live-action film, but Vierne was obviously interested in being as slavishly faithful to the look and feel of the series as possible, even if that meant having the fake beards on Haddock (Gerorges Wilson, nominated for a BAFTA the same year for The Long Absence) and Calculus (The Anniversary's Georges Loriot) looking suspiciously like construction paper that's been blackened with a felt-tip marker. Still, if you assume the cheesy, low-budget feel was intended (and given the bears, you kinda have to), then this becomes an enjoyable enough romp if you're not a complete purist.

Plot: Haddock inherits an old ship, the Golden Fleece, and he, Tintin (Jean-Pierre Talbot, the only actor to return for Tintin et les Oranges Bleues--and who never worked in film again after playing Tintin twice), and Milou (aka Snowy in English translations) head off to Greece to check the ship out. It turns out to be a broken-down heap with only a skeleton crew, but Tintin gets suspicious when Haddock is offered an astronomical sum for the ship. They decide to figure out what Haddock's old friend was on about, and thus begins their quest for a hidden cache of gold.

Yes, it's bland, and the actors sound a lot more like they're doing a first staged reading than making an actual movie. The special effects are atrocious, for the most part, and some characters seem to be there just to pacify fans of the comic books (Thomson and Thompson get especially short shrift). That said, it's silly fun. Not my first choice for a rainy night, but not my last, either. **",1255478400,3,1867,4.791925465838509
8142550,4,B000HXDT0S,"I never expected a Tintin adventure in life-action to be so great! The characters are well played, and the script follows the Herg style of story-telling. It's a pity the DVD's only in French with no English subtitles.",1201478400,3,218,4.7631578947368425
8142551,1,B000HXDT0S,"I had bought a copy of this film from Australia (Region 4) which had English sub-titles.  I wanted to send a copy to my family in the USA, so thought to get  Region 1 version from Amazon US.  Malheusement, this version was wholly in French with no sub-titles.  It could have been made more apparent in the description that there were no sub-titles.
I had bought a copy of Tintin and the Blue Oranges at the same, but this had been opened (which was how my family discovered that there were no sub-titles) and so I was unable to return the item.  (Again, the Australian version does have English sub-titles)
With a foreign language product, it would have not been difficult to state whether sub-titles were available, more clearly.",1201478400,4,730,4.627906976744186
