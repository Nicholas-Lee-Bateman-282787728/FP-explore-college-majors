8620716,5,B00G4RBT44,"This is an excellent movie that could have gone off the rails at so many points but never does. Because the subject is inherently controversial, director Tim Robbins could have turned it into a polemical screed. He didn't. He dramatizes all sides of these flawed characters' circumstances and leaves final judgment with his audience. This could have been bastardized as a weepy melodrama. It wasn't. The performances by Sarandon, Penn, and Prosky are top-drawer. Respect is shown to the memoir of Sr. Helen Prejean, who served as the movie's technical advisor and briefly appears in a cameo. More important, respect is shown to the criminals and their victims and all the families caught up in such a hideous maelstrom. This is a film to be seen, pondered, and discussed.",1506211200,,771,4.984496124031008

A man is on death row. He didn't kill anyone, he says, his partner did it. But the law says partners in a murder are equally guilty. [One reason to be careful of who you chose as friends.] On her way home Sr. Helen Prejean CSJ is stopped for speeding, the policeman lets her off with a warning. The nun review the reports of the crime. Pnocelet got the death penalty, his partner got life in prison. [Why did the jury make this choice? Maybe it was their records or demeanor.] The victims were robbed and then murdered, no witnesses. The Parole Board is composed of political appointees. Can Poncelets mother speak for her son? A TV show made arguments against Matthew (who was raised without a father). [Can you believe everything on TV? Is it Truth or Entertainment?]

Sr. Helen talks to Matthew. His mom talks to the Board. There are no rich men on death row. Matthews lawyer never tried a murder case before. Lethal injection is the most human death penalty. [I think the quickest would be the most humane.] The prosecutor reviews the case. [There is no question of guilt here.] The parents of the victims complain about Sr. Helens defense of Matthew; their loss is permanent. The Board refuses clemency. Sr. Helen visits the Delacroix family and learns of their sorrow. Can Sr. Helen act as a spiritual advisor? Matthew speaks about his beliefs. People gather outside the prison walls to celebrate an execution. St. Helen talks to the murdered girls parents. Their daughter Hope left for work, then a date with Walter, but never returned. Six days later the bodies were found, stabbed and shot. Dental records were used to identify the body. [A bullet in the back of the head can destroy the face.] A TV show has an interview with Matthew, who admired and approved of Hitler! People question Sr. Helens priorities.

Sr. Helen hears the stories of the victims relatives, and the effects. Divorce of parents is common. Sr. Helen meets Matthew in his new cell; he is heavily guarded now. They talk about the teachings of Jesus. A priest talks about the Old Testament. Will Matthew accept his guilt and repent? Note Matthews reaction to Sr. Helens absence. There is a meeting with the Governor; he won't interfere unless its a question of innocence. Matthew is getting ready to go. His relatives visit Matthew for a talk. Matthew gives them his belongings. Goodbye. He failed a lie detector test (it really shows stress). There is a flashback to the crime. [The couple parked in the wrong place in the country. One cure is to park in a safe place, or even a room in a house. Would the parents allow this?]

The Federal Appeals Court turned him down. Matthew got a tattoo so his body can be identified! He makes a telephone call to his family. Does he take responsibility now? Yes. The victims families arrive to witness the death. Its time to go. Matthew is strapped in, a needle put into his vein. Any last words? He asks forgiveness for his actions. At midnight the machine is turned on so the drugs are delivered in the proper sequence. Matthews eyes close. There are flashbacks to the murders. The next day there is a burial. Later Sr. Helen visits a housing project. Can she help others? [We all hope so. But economics and culture can negate good intentions.]

This is worth watching once. The last part of the movie seem to run on too long. I think it gives a balanced overview even tho it is biased against the death penalty. Prevention is better than the cure for murderers. I read that when the employment rate goes up the homicide rate goes down. Can this make a difference? Travel leads to accidents and death but people still travel for their needs and wants. I think as long as we have people we will have murders and thefts, etc.",1469404800,,3773,4.600297176820208
