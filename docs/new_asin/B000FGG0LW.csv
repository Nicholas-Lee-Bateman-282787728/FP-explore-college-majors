I know it's not exactly Thin Lizzy, but it would have been a nice bonus. The second, they could have labeled it better. The tracks say live (most of them aren't) but give us the date. You did it for Whiskey In The Jar, why couldn't you label the rest? Well anyways, it features music videos along with promos, which are all mimed. Come on people you should have known that back then everyone mimed, and even today they still do! The sound quality is good, but the video quality varies at times, in particular The Boys Are Back In Town, but hey, it's from the 70's, what were you expecting? Overall it's a great buy, especially for Thin Lizzy fans.",1304121600,,758,4.345070422535211
