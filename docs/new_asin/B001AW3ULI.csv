8279928,5,B001AW3ULI,"When we bought our bank-owned house 16 months ago, the entire 1.13 acre lot was covered with brush. Upon cleanup we discovered more gopher mounds than flat ground. We used the black hole traps with some success, but I didn't like having to dig holes in the ground to trap gophers, and I absolutely don't want to use poison on land which we expect to use to produce organic produce. I ordered this video along with recommended cinch traps and hori hori knife from the video's producer. I watched the first 15 minutes of the video, took a break to go set traps, and returned to watch more video. I believe I remember the video mentioning sometimes getting gophers within a few minutes. So I paused the video to go check my traps, and I had caught 2 gophers within 10 minutes. The major benefit of the method, and the video, is that it teaches you how to look at a fresh gopher mound, know where the hole is, which direction the tunnel is going, and be able to quickly pop open the hole and insert a trap without doing any more damage to your lawn than was already done by the gopher. Over the past 16 months, we've trapped well over 300 gophers on our 1 acre. This week it seems we have had a sudden burst in activity. I set out 7 traps yesterday, and when my sons checked the traps today, we had caught 6 gophers. If you have gopher problems, this is a must have item!!!!",1331424000,,1370,4.273076923076923
8279929,5,B001AW3ULI,"I've tried trapping, smoking with car exhaust, flooding,shooting,owel boxes,and hawk perches. The method suggested in Easy Gopher Control Without Poisons gives me the best results. I'm getting two to three gophers a day with just four traps. Maybe I should give up farming and go into the fur coat business",1230854400,,306,5.14
8279930,5,B001AW3ULI,"This DVD contains several chapters, covering gophers and their habits, how to distinguish gophers from other pests, the trapping method used, real examples of trapping gophers (at various locations such as vineyards,
a soccer field, etc) and finally, a question and answer session. The method works very well (I purchased the
author's starter kit and trapped a gopher that had been plaguing our vegetable garden and backyard in 4
hours). If you have gophers you're trying to eliminate this is the DVD for you.",1220832000,,509,5.071428571428571
8279931,5,B001AW3ULI,"Great video. Until I watched this I was using Macabee traps and a table spoon to TRY to catch the critters. Watched the video, learned about gopher behavior and how to SMARTLY go after them. Got some cinch traps and hori-hori knife. My yard isn't gopher free yet, but it under control. The cinch traps are't cheap, but they are well worth the investment as was the knife. I also use the traps for moles in spite of the author's recommendation and they work great.
