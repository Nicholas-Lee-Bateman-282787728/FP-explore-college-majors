3160406,4,B0016MOWOG,"Armed with an amazing cast and a sweet story line, Bonneville, hits the road with the sudden death of Arvilla's (Jessica Lange) husband and the demand by his snotty daughter that his ashes be delivered to his memorial ceremony several states away. Arvilla is not ready to give him up and feels a little overwhelmed so her friends insist on flying with her. Plans change enroute and the journey becomes a road trip in Arvilla's classic convertible. Arvilla and her friends discover far more about each other and themselves and begin to glimpse that there is hope even when the summer of life turns into autumn.

A definite girlfriend flick with a more mature angle than the usual offering. Flashes of giddiness, heartfelt conversation, poignant situations, horrible moments and sweet acceptance fill the film. The slower pace and the people along the way, the experiences that cement the friends, and the resolution make for some thought-provoking viewing. Bonneville is squeaky clean and entertaining. After all two Mormon ladies and a recent widow can't get into too much trouble, right?",1211500800,11,1088,5.078212290502793

3160454,4,B0016MOWOG,"This is a film about older women friends rebonding on a trip to take one's husband's ashes to a family funeral.  The acting is superb on all levels as is obvious from the star triple-header cast.  Women will like this one especially and if their male companions or husbands watch, they may also enjoy,  It's not a film that will interest people under 45 since it has to do with life issues as we age. It is a quiet and rather droll film with a really good acting turn from Tom Skerrit as a truck driver the women meet along the way.  It has humor and pathos and leaves good feelings in its wake.  The title comes from the beautifully restored Pontiac Bonneville the gals drive across country.",1441584000,2,692,4.375

3160537,5,B0016MOWOG,"I just loved it.  There is nothing better than a great road movie with great characters and gorgeous scenery.  Beautifully photographed.  It's seldom that you see a movie that hasn't a single bad or uninteresting scene.  Of course if you only like movies with car crashes and people being beaten up or shot then you'll be bored with this.  For anyone with real taste for excellent movies then this is one for you.  I can't recommend this highly enough. It's odd but Joan Allen who has always looked old in movies looks lovely in this.  Maybe she is one of those women who will age beautifully.  Wish I could say the same for Jessica Lange.  She either had plastic surgery that went wrong or she just aged really badly.  Kathy Bates, lord love her, always looks the same.  60 lbs under there is a pretty woman but she always charms.",1408406400,,831,4.473333333333334

3160543,5,B0016MOWOG,"This is right at the top of my all-time favorite movies list. The acting is fabulous, each of the women bringing her unique part beautifully into the story. It's about friendship and being open to new experiences; about discovering more to one's Self than one previously expected. While it is poignant, the story is also uplifting. I'd already watched it several times, and finally bought a copy for myself.",1402272000,,407,4.913043478260869
3160544,3,B0016MOWOG,"I agree completely with David Rooney of Variety on this one. ""A bland road movie running on empty with a deluxe cast wasted on by-the-numbers material. There's a big difference between a filmmaker who can actually convey with real feeling the pain of loss or the courage required to carry on, and one who merely connects the dots to illustrate it."" Bottom line: it's worth watching once for the gorgeous photography and the wonderful actors, but I won't be watching it again.",1400284800,,475,4.804878048780488

3160569,5,B0016MOWOG,"This is an amazing road-trip film with the star powers of Oscar winners Kathy Bates and Jessica Lang along with Diane Lane. Lang plays a woman who must return her husbands ashes to California as so she brings along her two best friends for fun. The trip to California gets sidestepped as the trio embarks on territory like Palm Springs and Las Vegas where they meet a series of people with their own problems.

 What the film shows is that no matter how terrible things are it always works out especially if you have friends to depend on!

 The writing is strong and the acting could not have been better and ""Bonneville"" ranks up there with other road films like ""Easy Rider"" and ""Thelma and Louise""",1396310400,,700,4.531746031746032
3160570,3,B0016MOWOG,"When Jessica Lange's husband passes away, the daughter from his first marriage played by Christine Baranski comes to claim his ashes.  Lange resists and Baranski threatens to keep the lovely home Lange is residing.  Lange struggles with her desire to keep his ashes or be penniless, since her husband failed to update his will after they married 20 years earlier.

Enter the Bonneville, the gorgeous car that Lange and her sidekicks, Kathy Bates and Joan Allen take a road trip from Pocatello, ID to California to deliver the deceased ashes at his memorial service.  Lange and company take multiple detours through beautiful terrains, as she reflects on her life with her adventurous husband.  The story is sentimental and the friends reconnect, as each reflect on their present lives both the satisfying and dissatisfying parts.  Bates meets Tom Skerritt along the way, which evolves into a serious romance.

The story was a nice way to pass 90 minutes, however, I was so distracted by Lange's poor cosmetic surgery that it was distracting.  I know that is superficial, I don't ordinarily notice these things but she is almost completely devoid of any facial expression and you had focus solely on her voice inflection and body language to relate to her emotional state.  If Lange was she not such a great actress, it would have ruined the film.

This movie wasn't exceptional but it definitely would appeal to many women facing empty nest and singleness later in life.  The friendships were believable.  Skerritt was a nice addition to the scenario, providing hope that at the end of one part of life, there is the possibility of new beginnings.",1393545600,,1647,4.949090909090909
3160571,5,B0016MOWOG,"Excellent Acting and Writing.  It is not about the car.  Its about the people.
This is for a mature viewer.",1393286400,,107,4.3
3160572,5,B0016MOWOG,"Bought this movie because I'm a huge fan of Jessica Lange.  I am currently watching her in American Horror Story and find her acting abilities just spellbinding.  Especially since she's not even a fan of horror and truly doesn't relate to the genre but she sure does deliver it!  She certainly deserves more Oscars/Emmys!!!  Anyways, this is not a horror flick, but a chick flick about middle age women. The storyline is superbly written and the actors have the chemistry to make this film feel like it is actually occuring and you're invited along for the ride.",1391299200,,562,4.762886597938144

Take care Kathy Bates you are the best and Joan and Jessica!!  Three of the best together.  This is a must see movie, oh and Tom Skerritt....what an actor.

The movie is formulaic with the typical best friends helping a grieving widow.  After having been married for 20+ years, Arvilla has lost her husband.  One of his dying wishes was to have his ashes spread over the places that he loved; this does not sit well Arvilla's stepdaughter who wants her ""daddy"" to be interred next to her mother.  Throwing salt in the wound, if Arvilla does not comply, nasty stepdaughter will take the family home away from her.

Instead of flying from Pocatello, Idaho to Santa Barbara, California they decide to take the late husband's Bonneville on a cross county excursion stopping in the places that dear dead husband enjoyed.  Funny, apparently there are no freeways from Pocatello to Santa Barbara since they seem to be in some rather out of the way gas stations.

After arriving late for the funeral with guilty looks on their faces, the ashes are finally presented to wicked stepdaughter only there is quite a funny surprise when the ashes are accidently spilled.  Actually, that is the best part of the movie.

There are a couple of things that just did not make sense in this movie - Why was it necessary to make reference to a characters Mormonism when in fact they just made fun of the customs of that religion throughout the movie.  How did the truck driver find them at yet another out of the way gas station driving a little blue truck instead of his 18-wheeler?

The little things here and there drove me crazy.  I guess if you are looking for mindless entertainment this would suffice, but if you are hoping for something to dig your teeth into, this just is not it.",1302566400,3,1740,4.577419354838709

3160687,4,B0016MOWOG,"I really enjoyed watching this female road trip movie. Basically my movie watching has been limited, so I really appreciate the ones I catch. At 50 myself it seemed to talk to me. As stated here, all over these pages, a character Lange inhabits is taking the ashes of her husband to places (in his Bonneville) that he loved resisting a daughter's demands (previous wife) for her father's return. Yes the ashes. She really can't bring him to her in any sense of the word, and the movie is touching as Arvilla and her two friends travel her memories, good thoughts, grief into the present. While slowly scattering him as she goes. In a way what I took from the film was the importance of her doing what she does, and she does this to reclaim herself within the now. She faces, I suppose, her fears/pain/grief or her realities and decides within the context of the story that she will deal with where she is, it is, it's a lovely way to be told through good acting and lovely landscapes. Worth the afternoon. Since these are spaces I know well in my life it meant something more maybe. At least it felt familiar.

I get cheered by the fact that her friend finds a love along the way- her chubby, interesting, caring friend. And who she finds- he's just a good person played so nicely. I liked that. It's just there the possibility. You have no idea how much i appreciated that. I appreciated the fact that a good actress inhabited that part.

If you like women's films, roadtrip movies, if you want to think about a woman facing the loss of a spouse, her realities, the strangeness of families in relationship to this, if you like movies that are small and intimate, like pretty sunlight, conversation, nice acting you might enjoy this. I'd take it along to a cabin in the mountains or to watch it if meeting with a friend of mine to go see something new as our life opens up. As my children are growing into their lives, it seems like the kind of piece speaking to a woman about her own inner life, the place of her recollection, memories, about honoring the times of a life and moving into next days.

3160726,3,B0016MOWOG,"Casting three powerhouse actresses of a certain age in a road movie may sound like a promising concept, but I was disappointed by how insular and monotonous the film feels for a shared journey supposedly focused on self-discovery. Director Christopher N. Rowley and screenwriter Daniel D. Davis, both first-timers to feature films, don't really offer the intimidating trio of Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates and Joan Allen much to work with in terms of character or story development, and were it not for the three actresses, this little-seen 2008 movie would have surely ended up on Lifetime TV where it most obviously belongs.

The plot focuses mainly on Arvilla Holden, who just lost Joe, her husband of twenty years while on vacation in Borneo. Back home in Pocatello, Idaho, it doesn't take long for her resentful stepdaughter Francine to stake a claim on her father's ashes to transport them back for a funeral service the following week in Santa Barbara where she lives. Arvilla, however, promised Joe to scatter his ashes at various places that meant something to them. Francine threatens to take away Arvilla's house unless she complies. Under emotional duress, Arvilla agrees but only if she can deliver the ashes herself. She then turns to her friends, sassy Margene and uptight Carol for support as they head out on a road trip to California taking Joe's beloved `66 Bonneville convertible. The rest of the movie follows their various adventures, which include picking up a young hitchhiker looking for his birth father, flirting with a smitten truck driver, and making the typical stops one would make west of the Rockies.

With her shopworn beauty compromised a bit by surgery, Lange is still able to convey the tethered fragility of her early-career work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frances/dp/B00005OCK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frances</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tootsie/dp/B000ZM1MG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tootsie</a>. She inhabits Arvilla with that lost, Blanche DuBois-like quality that fits the character's delusional aspects very well.

While the various locations - Bryce Canyon, Bonneville Salt Flats, Joshua Tree - are nicely filmed by Jeffrey L. Kimball, those expecting a post-menopausal version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thelma-Louise/dp/B00007BKVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thelma & Louise</a>&nbsp;will likely be disappointed since the film's energy level sputters with every curve of the road, especially as it veers toward a predictably drawn ending. At the same time, when are you likely to see actresses of this caliber share the screen again? The 2008 DVD is short on extras - a standard ten-minute making-of featurette with gushing testimonials by the actresses, several deleted/alternate scenes of varying quality, a one-minute gag reel, and a promotional spot for The Red Hat Society, a social organization for women over fifty.",1217203200,,4361,6.939890710382514
3160727,4,B0016MOWOG,"I picked up this movie through Netflix as a recommedation for liking Kathy Bates.  I'd never heard of it, but I'm a sap for ""Thelma and Louise"" type movies so I gave it a try.  And I'm glad I did.

Thelma and Louise fans will definitely relate to this one, despite there being three ladies in the convertible this time.  The similarities are astounding...right down to them picking up a cute hitch hiker and coming into possession of a lot of money, and wearing the signature scarves and sunglasses with the top down.  But, Bonneville definitely stands on its own and has it's own completely different storyline.

Yeah, it's a bit of a sappy movie.  Two women driving cross country with their recently widowed sister to deliver her dead husband's ashes to his demanding daughter (a small part played by Baranski).  But anyone who has lost a loved one, or possibly had to deal with overbearing family members who weren't always around when the person was living, will definitely relate.

The ending is completely predictable, and plays out just as I expected it would but with a nice simple twist at the end.  But just as the overall theme of the movie resonates, sometimes it is more important to just throw up your hands, shrug it off, and accept what life hands to you today.  You'll always have your memories, and no one can take that away from you.

3160729,4,B0016MOWOG,"BONNEVILLE creeps up on the viewer.  It is a solid marriage of light comedy and sentiment and the somewhat slight story is brought to life by the natural gifts of a trio of superb actors.  Why it did not find popularity in the theaters is probably due to the topic of death and the cast of 'older actresses', but it is a solid little film that deserves more attention.

Arvilla (Jessica Lange) has lost her husband of 20 years and promised to scatter his ashes over places the couple loved. Her step daughter Francine (Christine Baranski) demands the 'ashes' be buried next to her mother's grave in Santa Barbara, threatening her stepmother with eviction from her Pocatello, Idaho home if Arvilla doesn't comply.  Two of Arvilla's friends - the restless widow Margene (Kathy Bates) and the oh-so-Mormon Carol (Joan Allen) support their friend and plan to fly with Arvilla to take the ashes to Santa Barbara.  But circumstances begin to change when the threesome bond tightly and decide to take Arvilla's husband's old Bonneville on a road trip to California.  From here on the film is a Road Trip - a time when the three women learn lessons about life and death and love and compassion from each other - and from a young hitchhiker Bo (Victor Rasuk of 'Saving Victor Vargas', 'Stop-Loss' etc) and trucker Emmett (Tom Skirrett). The trip from Idaho to California passes through some of the Southwest's most beautiful scenery, places once shared by Arvilla and her late husband, and slowly the urn of ashes is distributed along the way to the dreaded Santa Barbara funeral.

Christopher N. Rowley directs this sweet story by Daniel D. Davis with great respect for the gifts of the three fine actors, allowing them to show us just why they remain some of our finest talent on the screen.  It is not a great film, but it has such a fine heart that we can relax and just ride along with it.  Grady Harp, July 08",1215043200,19,1906,4.648809523809524

I can't wait to watch this with my daughters who are in their 20's they will love it as the scene with them dancing and singing in the car to the song ""Cha Cha"" is so funny..but the scene in the hotel room with Kathy Bates on the bed looking for more quarters was hysterical...I could have watched her character all night...she is amazing.

The audience appeal on this one is apparent and I don't think it will disappoint my ""lady-flick"" customers in any way. The performances are fine, the story is fair - but I have to say the strengths of this film are the locations and the car.

Lake Powell, the salt flats and Bryce NP, coupled with the desert vistas and Calif. coast make for great backdrops, especially when visited in a classic convertible. Technically, the movie is flawed in a variety of ways, including strange plot points; the hitchhiker seemed like he was hiding something else but never alluded to it, the unanswered actions of  Joan Allen's character re: the phone, the obvious car changes, unended or walked-into dialogue points, dialogue errors (eulogy made him over 80 years old but in the deleted pics he was obviously 50-60), Skerrit's magical truck change, etc.

The deleted scenes help with some of those issues, I wish they would have all been in the film. The alternate opening was much better and would have helped the film make more sense regarding their marriage. The docu is another ""I loved working with everyone"" cut, and did provide a little into the Mormon angle for Joan's character. The alternate endings had much more closure, but overall they were having fun making the film and it shows.

This is a great road trip/female buddy movie with flawless performances, beautiful scenery, laughter and tears, even a little romance mixed in along the way.

3394951,4,B0016MOWOG,"This is a film about older women friends rebonding on a trip to take one's husband's ashes to a family funeral.  The acting is superb on all levels as is obvious from the star triple-header cast.  Women will like this one especially and if their male companions or husbands watch, they may also enjoy,  It's not a film that will interest people under 45 since it has to do with life issues as we age. It is a quiet and rather droll film with a really good acting turn from Tom Skerrit as a truck driver the women meet along the way.  It has humor and pathos and leaves good feelings in its wake.

It's seldom that you see a movie that hasn't a single bad or uninteresting scene.  Of course if you only like movies with car crashes and people being beaten up or shot then you'll be bored with this.  For anyone with real taste for excellent movies then this is one for you.  I can't recommend this highly enough. It's odd but Joan Allen who has always looked old in movies looks lovely in this.  Maybe she is one of those women who will age beautifully.  Wish I could say the same for Jessica Lange.  She either had plastic surgery that went wrong or she just aged really badly.

There's a big difference between a filmmaker who can actually convey with real feeling the pain of loss or the courage required to carry on, and one who merely connects the dots to illustrate it.""

3395066,5,B0016MOWOG,"This is an amazing road-trip film with the star powers of Oscar winners Kathy Bates and Jessica Lang along with Diane Lane. Lang plays a woman who must return her husbands ashes to California as so she brings along her two best friends for fun. The trip to California gets sidestepped as the trio embarks on territory like Palm Springs and Las Vegas where they meet a series of people with their own problems.

 What the film shows is that no matter how terrible things are it always works out especially if you have friends to depend on!

 The writing is strong and the acting could not have been better and ""Bonneville"" ranks up there with other road films like ""Easy Rider"" and ""Thelma and Louise""",1396310400,,700,4.531746031746032
3395067,3,B0016MOWOG,"When Jessica Lange's husband passes away, the daughter from his first marriage played by Christine Baranski comes to claim his ashes.  Lange resists and Baranski threatens to keep the lovely home Lange is residing.  Lange struggles with her desire to keep his ashes or be penniless, since her husband failed to update his will after they married 20 years earlier.

Enter the Bonneville, the gorgeous car that Lange and her sidekicks, Kathy Bates and Joan Allen take a road trip from Pocatello, ID to California to deliver the deceased ashes at his memorial service.  Lange and company take multiple detours through beautiful terrains, as she reflects on her life with her adventurous husband.  The story is sentimental and the friends reconnect, as each reflect on their present lives both the satisfying and dissatisfying parts.  Bates meets Tom Skerritt along the way, which evolves into a serious romance.

The story was a nice way to pass 90 minutes, however, I was so distracted by Lange's poor cosmetic surgery that it was distracting.  I know that is superficial, I don't ordinarily notice these things but she is almost completely devoid of any facial expression and you had focus solely on her voice inflection and body language to relate to her emotional state.  If Lange was she not such a great actress, it would have ruined the film.

This movie wasn't exceptional but it definitely would appeal to many women facing empty nest and singleness later in life.  The friendships were believable.  Skerritt was a nice addition to the scenario, providing hope that at the end of one part of life, there is the possibility of new beginnings.",1393545600,,1647,4.949090909090909

Especially since she's not even a fan of horror and truly doesn't relate to the genre but she sure does deliver it!  She certainly deserves more Oscars/Emmys!!!  Anyways, this is not a horror flick, but a chick flick about middle age women.

3395156,3,B0016MOWOG,"This is an OK movie, not great but something nice to have on in the background while you are doing your stuff around the house.

The movie is formulaic with the typical best friends helping a grieving widow.  After having been married for 20+ years, Arvilla has lost her husband.  One of his dying wishes was to have his ashes spread over the places that he loved; this does not sit well Arvilla's stepdaughter who wants her ""daddy"" to be interred next to her mother.  Throwing salt in the wound, if Arvilla does not comply, nasty stepdaughter will take the family home away from her.

Instead of flying from Pocatello, Idaho to Santa Barbara, California they decide to take the late husband's Bonneville on a cross county excursion stopping in the places that dear dead husband enjoyed.  Funny, apparently there are no freeways from Pocatello to Santa Barbara since they seem to be in some rather out of the way gas stations.

After arriving late for the funeral with guilty looks on their faces, the ashes are finally presented to wicked stepdaughter only there is quite a funny surprise when the ashes are accidently spilled.  Actually, that is the best part of the movie.

There are a couple of things that just did not make sense in this movie - Why was it necessary to make reference to a characters Mormonism when in fact they just made fun of the customs of that religion throughout the movie.  How did the truck driver find them at yet another out of the way gas station driving a little blue truck instead of his 18-wheeler?

The little things here and there drove me crazy.  I guess if you are looking for mindless entertainment this would suffice, but if you are hoping for something to dig your teeth into, this just is not it.",1302566400,3,1740,4.577419354838709

Francine is determined to see her father laid to rest next to her mother in Santa Barbara, and she's threatened to sell the house that her father and Arvilla have lived in since marrying to ensure that she gets her way.

3395184,4,B0016MOWOG,"I really enjoyed watching this female road trip movie. Basically my movie watching has been limited, so I really appreciate the ones I catch. At 50 myself it seemed to talk to me. As stated here, all over these pages, a character Lange inhabits is taking the ashes of her husband to places (in his Bonneville) that he loved resisting a daughter's demands (previous wife) for her father's return. Yes the ashes. She really can't bring him to her in any sense of the word, and the movie is touching as Arvilla and her two friends travel her memories, good thoughts, grief into the present. While slowly scattering him as she goes. In a way what I took from the film was the importance of her doing what she does, and she does this to reclaim herself within the now. She faces, I suppose, her fears/pain/grief or her realities and decides within the context of the story that she will deal with where she is, it is, it's a lovely way to be told through good acting and lovely landscapes. Worth the afternoon. Since these are spaces I know well in my life it meant something more maybe. At least it felt familiar.

I get cheered by the fact that her friend finds a love along the way- her chubby, interesting, caring friend. And who she finds- he's just a good person played so nicely. I liked that. It's just there the possibility. You have no idea how much i appreciated that. I appreciated the fact that a good actress inhabited that part.

If you like women's films, roadtrip movies, if you want to think about a woman facing the loss of a spouse, her realities, the strangeness of families in relationship to this, if you like movies that are small and intimate, like pretty sunlight, conversation, nice acting you might enjoy this. I'd take it along to a cabin in the mountains or to watch it if meeting with a friend of mine to go see something new as our life opens up. As my children are growing into their lives, it seems like the kind of piece speaking to a woman about her own inner life, the place of her recollection, memories, about honoring the times of a life and moving into next days.

3395223,3,B0016MOWOG,"Casting three powerhouse actresses of a certain age in a road movie may sound like a promising concept, but I was disappointed by how insular and monotonous the film feels for a shared journey supposedly focused on self-discovery. Director Christopher N. Rowley and screenwriter Daniel D. Davis, both first-timers to feature films, don't really offer the intimidating trio of Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates and Joan Allen much to work with in terms of character or story development, and were it not for the three actresses, this little-seen 2008 movie would have surely ended up on Lifetime TV where it most obviously belongs.

The plot focuses mainly on Arvilla Holden, who just lost Joe, her husband of twenty years while on vacation in Borneo. Back home in Pocatello, Idaho, it doesn't take long for her resentful stepdaughter Francine to stake a claim on her father's ashes to transport them back for a funeral service the following week in Santa Barbara where she lives. Arvilla, however, promised Joe to scatter his ashes at various places that meant something to them. Francine threatens to take away Arvilla's house unless she complies. Under emotional duress, Arvilla agrees but only if she can deliver the ashes herself. She then turns to her friends, sassy Margene and uptight Carol for support as they head out on a road trip to California taking Joe's beloved `66 Bonneville convertible. The rest of the movie follows their various adventures, which include picking up a young hitchhiker looking for his birth father, flirting with a smitten truck driver, and making the typical stops one would make west of the Rockies.

With her shopworn beauty compromised a bit by surgery, Lange is still able to convey the tethered fragility of her early-career work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frances/dp/B00005OCK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frances</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tootsie/dp/B000ZM1MG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tootsie</a>. She inhabits Arvilla with that lost, Blanche DuBois-like quality that fits the character's delusional aspects very well. Bates (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/About-Schmidt/dp/B00005JLSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">About Schmidt</a>) is in familiar territory as Margene, supplying comic relief and surprising poignancy through her trademark salt-of-the-earth persona. As the hopelessly prim Carol, a devout Mormon, the versatile Allen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Ultimatum/dp/B000VWYJ86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Upside-of-Anger/dp/B00005JNP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Upside of Anger</a>) uses her vast arsenal of talent to bring life to a relatively cardboard role.

Tom Skerritt relies on his familiar toothy charm as the truck driver, while Victor Rasuk (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raising-Victor-Vargas/dp/B0002HODEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raising Victor Vargas</a>) appears to be channeling early Brad Pitt as the low-key hitchhiker.

While the various locations - Bryce Canyon, Bonneville Salt Flats, Joshua Tree - are nicely filmed by Jeffrey L. Kimball, those expecting a post-menopausal version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thelma-Louise/dp/B00007BKVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thelma & Louise</a>&nbsp;will likely be disappointed since the film's energy level sputters with every curve of the road, especially as it veers toward a predictably drawn ending. At the same time, when are you likely to see actresses of this caliber share the screen again? The 2008 DVD is short on extras - a standard ten-minute making-of featurette with gushing testimonials by the actresses, several deleted/alternate scenes of varying quality, a one-minute gag reel, and a promotional spot for The Red Hat Society, a social organization for women over fifty.",1217203200,,4361,6.939890710382514
3395224,4,B0016MOWOG,"I picked up this movie through Netflix as a recommedation for liking Kathy Bates.  I'd never heard of it, but I'm a sap for ""Thelma and Louise"" type movies so I gave it a try.  And I'm glad I did.

Thelma and Louise fans will definitely relate to this one, despite there being three ladies in the convertible this time.  The similarities are astounding...right down to them picking up a cute hitch hiker and coming into possession of a lot of money, and wearing the signature scarves and sunglasses with the top down.  But, Bonneville definitely stands on its own and has it's own completely different storyline.

Yeah, it's a bit of a sappy movie.  Two women driving cross country with their recently widowed sister to deliver her dead husband's ashes to his demanding daughter (a small part played by Baranski).  But anyone who has lost a loved one, or possibly had to deal with overbearing family members who weren't always around when the person was living, will definitely relate.

The ending is completely predictable, and plays out just as I expected it would but with a nice simple twist at the end.  But just as the overall theme of the movie resonates, sometimes it is more important to just throw up your hands, shrug it off, and accept what life hands to you today.  You'll always have your memories, and no one can take that away from you.

A true gem of a movie that will make you laugh and cry, and an all star cast that does it justice!!",1215993600,18,1453,4.524904214559387

3395226,4,B0016MOWOG,"BONNEVILLE creeps up on the viewer.  It is a solid marriage of light comedy and sentiment and the somewhat slight story is brought to life by the natural gifts of a trio of superb actors.  Why it did not find popularity in the theaters is probably due to the topic of death and the cast of 'older actresses', but it is a solid little film that deserves more attention.

Arvilla (Jessica Lange) has lost her husband of 20 years and promised to scatter his ashes over places the couple loved. Her step daughter Francine (Christine Baranski) demands the 'ashes' be buried next to her mother's grave in Santa Barbara, threatening her stepmother with eviction from her Pocatello, Idaho home if Arvilla doesn't comply.  Two of Arvilla's friends - the restless widow Margene (Kathy Bates) and the oh-so-Mormon Carol (Joan Allen) support their friend and plan to fly with Arvilla to take the ashes to Santa Barbara.  But circumstances begin to change when the threesome bond tightly and decide to take Arvilla's husband's old Bonneville on a road trip to California.  From here on the film is a Road Trip - a time when the three women learn lessons about life and death and love and compassion from each other - and from a young hitchhiker Bo (Victor Rasuk of 'Saving Victor Vargas', 'Stop-Loss' etc) and trucker Emmett (Tom Skirrett). The trip from Idaho to California passes through some of the Southwest's most beautiful scenery, places once shared by Arvilla and her late husband, and slowly the urn of ashes is distributed along the way to the dreaded Santa Barbara funeral.

Christopher N. Rowley directs this sweet story by Daniel D. Davis with great respect for the gifts of the three fine actors, allowing them to show us just why they remain some of our finest talent on the screen.  It is not a great film, but it has such a fine heart that we can relax and just ride along with it.  Grady Harp, July 08",1215043200,19,1906,4.648809523809524

Out shopping last night and there it was for sale and I just knew with the cast of these 3 wonderful actresses I had to buy it.  My husband and I watched it last night and loved is so much...we are sadly lacking movies like this...also reminds me of the movie Upside Of Anger which Joan Allen also starred in and was another fantastic movie that was hidden away in small out of the way theaters and was so well done.  Is the movie industry embarrassed at putting out movies geared towards the over 40 year old??? as each time a well written movie like this comes out with a baby boomer cast it's only in select theaters....I want more of this...This was a really wonderful movie and I laughed so much watching 3 women have a blast together at a very sad but supportive time in their lives.  I can't wait to watch this with my daughters who are in their 20's they will love it as the scene with them dancing and singing in the car to the song ""Cha Cha"" is so funny..but the scene in the hotel room with Kathy Bates on the bed looking for more quarters was hysterical...I could have watched her character all night...she is amazing.

The audience appeal on this one is apparent and I don't think it will disappoint my ""lady-flick"" customers in any way. The performances are fine, the story is fair - but I have to say the strengths of this film are the locations and the car.

Lake Powell, the salt flats and Bryce NP, coupled with the desert vistas and Calif. coast make for great backdrops, especially when visited in a classic convertible. Technically, the movie is flawed in a variety of ways, including strange plot points; the hitchhiker seemed like he was hiding something else but never alluded to it, the unanswered actions of  Joan Allen's character re: the phone, the obvious car changes, unended or walked-into dialogue points, dialogue errors (eulogy made him over 80 years old but in the deleted pics he was obviously 50-60), Skerrit's magical truck change, etc.

The deleted scenes help with some of those issues, I wish they would have all been in the film. The alternate opening was much better and would have helped the film make more sense regarding their marriage. The docu is another ""I loved working with everyone"" cut, and did provide a little into the Mormon angle for Joan's character. The alternate endings had much more closure, but overall they were having fun making the film and it shows.

This is a great road trip/female buddy movie with flawless performances, beautiful scenery, laughter and tears, even a little romance mixed in along the way.
