1666327,4,B00005UQ76,"Avenging Eagle ranks up there with the best of them. It has
a story driven plot, fighting, a villen and more fighting.
Seeing this movie brigns me back to a time where a good kung
fu movie does not involve flying through the air like superman.
Shaw Brothers movies are THE Kung Fu movies of there day.",1055462400,4,301,4.298245614035087
1666328,5,B00005UQ76,"I have written soem reviews of other Shaw Brothers and Venoms films that I liked, but this one really caught me by surprise.
This is one of the Finest Films Every Made.
The acting and story are far superior to many movies of this genre and it is a timeless story that offers superior escapeism and entertainment value while pushing a very strong moral message throughout the movie.
Ti Lung gives the performance of a Lifetime as Chee Min Sing. His familiar name is Kow Chu, and he is a man trapped by fate and destiny who finds honor and truth in his life only after undergoing a terrible lifetime of violence and pain.
Alexander Fu-Sheng, also gives a tour de force performance and this actor was in other films with Ti Lung. Sadly, Alexander was killed in a car accident, and his light was taken from us. He is very impressive as Chow Yee Fan, a man who has lost everything and who finds himself united with Chee Min Sing.
The two become close friends and you have to feel that they must have been this close in real life as they seem 100% honest as friends joking and telling each other personal details about thier lives. Well, Chee Min Sing does more telling, but the ending revelas a lot of shocking information to us.
Alexander is a highly moral man who recited poetry of the time about old men who are forced from their homes to fight wondering if they will ever return, and fighting alongside his new friend facing death from many enemies.
The end of this film will have the hair on the back of your neck standing up. A series of fight sequences leads us to a finale that has us questioning everything we have seen up to this point.
This reviewer will NOT spoil the ending for you, but it will blow you away ! One of the finest ending I have ever seen in Any movie from any genre !
Ti Lung has an Eternal Fan in ME after this film. It also helped me understand the Better Tommorrow Series character he played much better then when I watched them before this film which he starred in many years earlier.
This one you can watch over and over, it is so wonderful.
Ti Lung, you are the Best ! ...",1041465600,16,2101,4.2947103274559195
1666329,5,B00005UQ76,"Chi (Ti Lung) a member of the Eagles, a ruthless killing squad. Is forced to kill a pregnant woman. He decides he no longer wants to be part of the killing and runs away, he passes out while making his way through the desert where he is found and helped out by a stranger (Fu Sheng). He and the stranger become friends while defending themselves from his old gang who want to kill him. He and his new friend set out to destroy the evil gang. Chi plagued by guilt is convinced that the only way he can undo his wrong is to die at the hand of the pregnant woman's husband.
The DVD quality is what is you can expect from from a dubbed VCR tape to DVD. This is quite normal for a movie of this type and any true kung fu movie collector wouldn't worry about this.
I rate movies based upon the content, the actors, and costumes and humour. The quality of the DVD has little to do with how I rate these types of movies.
This type of movie is nothing like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Iron Monkey. If your looking for movies like that don't bother watching this.",1012694400,12,1059,4.170731707317073

I watched them for three things: The fight scenes, the weapons, and the weapons. Did I mention I loved the weapons? Where else could you see fight scenes with those types of weapons back in the day? this movie has a LOT of fight scenes and pretty much all involve exotic weaponry. So if that's what you're looking for then you'll love this one. Plus, it actually has a very good story of revenge and redemption but in the tragic Kung Fu Theater style.

I personally enjoyed the film for its story, plot, art design, action set pieces, and of course it use of martial arts. I can not say a whole lot without spoiling it, but all in all this is a great film to watch with others or by yourself for nostalgic  reasons. If I have any complaints it is just I wished Shaw Brothers continued on to make more of these B-movie classics or at least got a chance to created a television inspired by all their old products.

1666462,5,B00005UQ76,"I've seen tons of reviews for this, one of my favorite Shaw Brothers flicks, and so there's not much I can say that adds anything new to the discussion. I think maybe half of them use the word ""solid"" in terms of the script, the acting, and the fighting, and I can't argue.

What I can say is that this movie is far better than it looks on the printed page. Any description is automatic cliche': Two strangers meet in the wasteland, one escaping his past and his enemies, the other with a motive that might put the two of them at odds. Or, call it the story of a killer pained by the evils he's done, and slowly realizing how far he must go to atone. Or...a criminal hunted by his former brothers in arms, each specializing in his own exotic weapon...you get the idea. It sounds like standard stuff. Somehow, Ti Lung, Fu Sheng and Ku Feng(his best performance? Even including ""Uncle?), under the direction of Sun Chung, take a solid (there's that word) story and impart it with real human impact. Ti Lung's performance, in particular, is heartbreaking at times - he's been a cold-blooded killer most of his life, yet he's like a child as he discovers morality. He's almost an innocent. Watch his reaction when Fu Sheng chastises him for stealing his horse and food - it's something I missed my first viewing, the almost wondering look on his face as he thinks ""yes...that WAS wrong...""

And the fights, which are probably why you're looking at this in the first place, are great stuff. There's plenty of action as the hero, Chik Ming Sing, tries to stay ahead of ten of his former fellows, and fights for his life. He's no Gordon Liu or Lau Kar Leung with the three-sectioned staff, but again, great stuff. Far too often, a kung-fu flick's best fight isn't the final one, but Fu Sheng and Ti Lung go for broke in the intense final battle to push it one step beyond a terrific fight at a deserted inn at the end of the film's second act.

Then there's the ending. It hits hits you like a haymaker.

In short, this is a movie that completely rises above itself from start to finish, and takes you by surprise. Even if you're not into the whole HK cinema thing, it belongs in your DVD collection.",1352073600,6,2193,4.420792079207921

I have the remastered version on vcd and intend to purchase this dvd release by Dragon Dynasty having read the great reviews regarding picture and sound quality and the multi-audio and subtitle features.

I'd be very grateful if the reviewers can tell me where I can also purchase the dvd release of the 1993 remake of this classic called ""13 Cold-blooded Eagles"" in its original cantonese language with English subtitles?

The remake stars Hong Kong and Taiwan's new stars of the mid-80s and early 90s such as Cynthia Khan (star of Yuen Woo Ping's ""In the Line of Duty 3 and 4"", and ""Zen of Sword"") and Waise Lee ( John Woo's "" A Better Tomorrow"", Yuen Woo Ping's ""Wing Chun"" and Tsui Hark's ""Swordsman 2"")and also classic villain actor Yen Shi-Kwan (who plays the main badass villain in Jackie Chan's ""Fearless Hyena"", Lo Wei's ""Fearless Hyena 2"", Tsui Hark's ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and ""Swordsman 2"", Yuen Woo Ping's "" Iron Monkey"" and a wuxia warrior bodyguard in ""New Dragon Gate Inn"")and who also takes over the role of the Head Eagle clan leader played by Ku Feng in ""Avenging Eagle"".

I understand that dvd label Taisheng did release this dvd a few years ago but I have not been able to trace it

If the dvd is still available in USA I strongly urge Amazon to stock it for sale through Amazon or its marketplace sellers. This is a pretty good remake and those who enjoyed ""Avenging Eagle"" should also enjoy this new wave kungfu gem of a classic remake.",1328486400,,1659,4.553691275167785

It is directed by Sun Chung who has also the best Kung Fu Wuxia movies ever made. In the 70s there were many directors who did the best Wuxias like Chang Cheh,Chu Yuan,Tony Liu,Lau Kar Leung.

  Ti Lung and Alexander Fu Sheng are the main actors once again after past collaborations in Shaolin Temple,Deadly Breaking Sword,Sentimental Swordsman 2,Ten Tigers from Kwantung. So as you can see they both have gotten good chemistry together.  Ku Feng is the leader of the 13 coldblooded eagles and it is one of his best villian performances in his career. The 13 Eagles include many famous actors like Johny Wang Lung,Yuen Bun(Rendezvous with Death,Kill a Mastermind),Dick Wei(Project A),Eddy Ko(Duel to the Death),Lam Fai Wong,Peter Chan,Bruce Tong,Austin Wai,Jaime Luk.

Tong Gaai does the fight choreography and has a small cameo role he also directed three of the best Shaw Kung Fu movies ever:Shaolin Prince,Shaolin Intruders,Opium and the Kung Fu Master.

 This is a review from the Dragon Dynasty and it is the best version out there,it looks very clear and has good coloring. It includes both Mandarin Audio Track and English Dub.",1316736000,5,1579,5.839130434782609
1666533,4,B00005UQ76,"Firstly this movie is great. If you like old school kungfu movies this is a must. All of the Dragon Dynasty Shaw Brother dvds are remastered so the video quality is sharp and the colors are beautiful. Plus it is available in Chinese and English audio.
  Ti Lung plays a man on the run from his clan. He no longer wants to be a killer but his clan won't let him go.
On the run he meets Fu Sheng's character who start to help him but he has his reasons. They fight their way until they reach the leader of eagle clan where there is a fight to the death.
  The only problem is I'm not sure about the cover. I uploaded another cover DD was promoting which had Ti Lung and Fu Sheng in front of Ku Feng (still on the cover). This is the cover that works and is similar to the chinese dvd cover. I beleive this is the correct cover. I do not know who that guy is on the new cover replacing Ti lung's and Fu shengs' characters. This guy is not in the movie. As a long time kungfu movie fan I hate it when covers are done this bad. The latest set of DD dvds seem to have these bad covers with unknown guy who are not in the movie.
  Overall the movie is well worth purchasing but for fan, if this is the cover you may want to go online and download another fan made cover. I wonder if this cover gets worse on the back like it did for Executioner form Shaolin (Pai Mei Samurai?!).",1315526400,,1371,3.9854014598540144

How is it justified to remove the film's main stars- at least they left Ku Feng with his iron claws in the BG. Five Deadly Venoms has an awesome dvd cover, WITH the actual stars and good design work. Did some suit get inspired? Its an insult.",1313107200,,539,4.4
1666535,5,B00005UQ76,"Similar to ""Master Killer"",,this movie has it all..Superb fighting: with one of the most awesome display and usage of weaponry I ever witness.. Plot and storyline keeps U watching, and a twist at the end that really surprises U. Both Alexander Fu sheng, and Ti lung lay down fine performances. Also,the king eagle is a villian to remember with his vicious iron-eagle claw style. Highly recommend this movie to any true kungfu purest.",1198368000,,433,4.945205479452055
7955064,5,B00005UQ76,"I rank it up there with ""The Five Venoms"" and ""Shaolin Invincible"" as my favorite kung-fu flicks.  A revenge flick with a bad guy trying to turn straight.  Fu Sheng is great with Ti Lung as the protagonists as well as the great actor Ku Feng as the Eagle Chief (didn't even recognize him though in his film careers plays a variety of roles).",1516665600,,341,4.3125
7955065,5,B00005UQ76,"one of the more nice-plotted movies from Shaw, in stark contrast with some of the lighter fare with useless comedy. this is a true revenge/kung-fu movie in one package",1513296000,,167,4.793103448275862
7955066,5,B00005UQ76,"Avenging Eagle although not as popular as some of the other Shaw Bros films in my opinion is a great Kung Fu movie,its story is serious don't go into it expecting any corny comedy because it is just not there,what is there is the story of a man who rebels against his clan and its leader and is now being hunted by the other members of the clan because he no longer wishes to be a killer like the rest of them,there is more to the movie but that is the basic plot. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who has not yet seen it however something i feel the need to mention is that the fighting in this movie involves weapons rather than hand to hand combat.",1508889600,,665,4.123076923076923
7955067,4,B00005UQ76,"Dubbed in English, the movie has a decent story.  Kung-fu fight scenes are above average and well choreographed.  A guy is running away from his clan, and is being pursued to return.  He ran for so long that he was about to run out of water and food in the middle of a rocky desert, only to be saved by a guy who turns out to be someone whose wife was murdered by him.  However, the murder was at the request of the clan chief.  This chief had brought home many children when he was younger and trained them all to be monstrous bandits for this clan who will kill any one for money.  The reason this guy ran away was because one day he realized that he has always been a bad guy, but didn't know any better due to the brain washing training he received while growing up.  Most recently he fell in love with a woman who saved him, but he was ordered by the chief to kill the woman and her entire family.  He is now willing to admit his wrong and takes responsibility for his actions.  He decided to run away not knowing how to cope with his realization, but after meeting this guy who saved him from the desert, he now learns he must put an end to the clan chief.",1501718400,,1162,4.083700440528634
7955068,5,B00005UQ76,I'm a Kung fu movie junky and Avenging eagle is a must have. Glad I found English dub. I miss to much with subtitles. Plus I was raised on dubs and find them more entertaining . To each their own.,1498262400,,196,3.925
7955069,1,B00005UQ76,"I love this movie. I watched it so many times on Netflix that I was convinced I really should buy it. However, I'm incredibly irritated with the copy I bought here. At first, it looked like it couldn't have been a legit copy even though I couldn't quite put a finger on what was throwing me off. The case and dvd had a slight but distinct feeling of being bootlegged, but I only gave it minimal thought because I was so excited for the movie. However, as soon as I started the movie and the translations started appearing at the bottom of the screen, I quickly realized that they were all wrong. I had watched it on Netflix so many times I was practically repeating the right translations in my head the whole time. Not only was it wrong but many of the subs didn't make any sense and some were so off that they changed the story or the feeling of the story all together. I was angry and irritated and I refuse to watch the dvd again.",1497225600,,934,4.223463687150838
